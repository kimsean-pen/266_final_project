Walking myself home
These streets don't feel the same to me
Waking up alone
Wishing it was all a dream

Still out of sight, not out of mind
Still got the things you left behind
Can't box up memories tonight

I'd be lying if I said you're not always in my head
Yeah, I'd be lying to you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd be lying if I said I wish you never found my bed
Yeah, I'd be lying to you
I'd be lying to you, I'd be lying to you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Thought that I was fine
Then I saw your face again
When your eyes caught mine
I looked away

Still out of sight, not out of mind
Still got things you left behind
Can't box up memories tonight

I'd be lying if I said you're not always in my head
Yeah, I'd be lying to you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd be lying if I said I wish you never found my bed
Yeah, I'd be lying to you
I'd be lying to you, I'd be lying to you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Now coffee's old and bitter cold
And nothing tastes as good alone
Left here just staring at my phone
Still out of sight, not out of mind
Still got things you left behind
Can't box up memories tonight

I'd be lying if I said you're not always in my head
Yeah, I'd be lying to you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd be lying if I said I wish you never found my bed
Yeah, I'd be lying to you
I'd be lying to you, I'd be lying to you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
