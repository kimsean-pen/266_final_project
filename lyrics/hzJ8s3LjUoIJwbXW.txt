In the cold stone walls
House where the bleeding did fall
The mother is crying outside

In the darkest of hours
Left with the perilous thoughts
His circle, squeezed right, hurt soul

She said, "Oh, I'm gonna lose my baby
Oh, I'm gonna lose my way
And let there be something here"
Come hurry, and resurrect me

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

When the sun goes down
Into another light source
Baby's misguided, just glimpse

Then a neon cross shines
Shows us to tread on the light
Guilt trips or love grips, look blind

I said, "Lord, I'm gonna lose my baby
Lord, I'm gonna lose my way
And pushing me, I'm stuck here"
Come hurry, and resurrect me

I'm-a drown my head, for I'm ready to stop
I'm-a drop my head, for I'm ready to stop
I'm-a dig that grave for a ride for the drop
For I'm ready to stop
If I'm ready or not

I'm-a drop my head, for I'm ready to stop
I'm-a drown my head, for I'm ready to stop
I'm-a write my time before they throw out the clock
Charging work by the hour
Or making pay for the drop

I said, "Lord, we gonna lose our heads here
Lord, we gonna lose our pain"

I'm-a dig that grave
I'm-a dig that grave
Baby, drop there soon, hang the books out to lose
Write the devil's resurrection of the things we believe
I'm-a dig that grave
