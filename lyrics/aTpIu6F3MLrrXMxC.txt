If this ain't love

Holding you closer, it's time that I told you
Everything's going to be fine
Know that you need it and try to believe it
Take me one step at a time

If this ain't love
Why does it feel
(Why?)
Why does it feel
(Why?)
Why does it feel
(Why?)
Why does it feel so good?

If this ain't love
Why does it feel
(Why?)
Why does it feel
(Why?)
Why does it feel
(Why?)
Why does it feel so good?

Think of tomorrow, we beg, steal or borrow
To make all we can in the sun
While we are moving, the music is soothing
Troubles we thought had begun

If this ain't love
Why does it feel
(Why?)
Why does it feel
(Why?)
Why does it feel
(Why?)
Why does it feel so good?

If this ain't love
Why does it feel
(Why?)
Why does it feel
(Why?)
Why does it feel
(Why?)
Why does it feel so good?

Will you remember me, boy?
Remember me loving you

Just for this lifetime, you can be my pastime
Here are the rules of our play
In it together 'til I know you better, darling
Darling, now what do you say

If this ain't love
Why does it feel
(Why?)
Why does it feel
(Why?)
Why does it feel
(Why?)

Why does it feel
(Why?)
Why does it feel
(Why?)
Why does it feel
(Why?)
Why does it feel so good?

If this ain't love
Why does it feel
(Why?)
Why does it feel
(Why?)
Why does it feel
(Why?)
Why does it feel so good?

If this ain't love
(Why, why, why?)
Why does it feel so good?
