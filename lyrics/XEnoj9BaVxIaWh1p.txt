I thought the candle was gonna go out
The wind was blowing and the door was open
But the candle never went out, never went out
The wave found its way to the shore
I thought it was a ripple and nothing more
But the wave found its way all the way to the shore

Oh, I wanna burn this house
I know, I wanna jump into the fire
Oh, I've got to tear them down
The pinnacles of my invisible empire

I know the gamble never works twice
All the distractions of the table and the weighted dice
But the thrill of it feels so nice, you'd do it all again
But I look to the chips and lose
I'm standing on the platform with my neck in the noose
And I know it's not my time, it's not my time

Oh, I wanna burn this house
I know, I wanna jump into the fire
Oh, I've got to tear them down
The pinnacles of my invisible empire

And if I do all the things I do
Well, I tell myself that I'm staying true
I'll never stop, you know I'll never stop
You know I'll never think about it
Put an end to all this time
That I would spend with it on my mind
You know it never stopped, you know it never stopped
You know I always wondered about it

I wondered about the wonder
Oh, I wear a rusting crown
I know this dynasty is falling
The crowd shouts for another round. I see the ruin
The spectacular diamonds buried, icebergs, the minarets, and the marketplaces
The signal fires of my invisible empire
