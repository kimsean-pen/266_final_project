I've been always carrying you in different places
Looking out for you
But now it's telling me the parts of it now are down here
You called me in a splendorous way
Calming me down when a child I've been
Regrowing silent fears
Off to win a light of my own

Piecing in time all the forms of life given here
Bringing me softly in tears
Well, you're far away
Part of me is alone without you

No one can tell us what it's like
No one can help us realize
The space between us
Are you causing what's good enough for me
Are you causing

Are you waiting for something
Are we waiting for something to come
Are we waiting for something to come, something to find us

No one can tell us what it's like
No one can help us realize the space between us
Are you causing what's good enough for me
Are you causing space between us
Are you causing

Are you waiting?
Space between us
Are you waiting?
