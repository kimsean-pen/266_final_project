His beacon severes vision
Again alight from under
Crossing out their eyes
All vision ignored
Erasing the murmurs
Not want an utterance
Name and shape still unrevealed
Stabbing at the years he holds this audition
Dismantling all vessels of labor
Stumbling to reach the inception
No more can we be found
For belief cannot be seen
It is the frequency of day
Commencing with dry stutters
Begins the nucleus
We are found no more
But a scarred key
And the altered ticket
And tremendous ficitons
Subterrestrial illuminations
We are found
No/thing
But one piece of his whole
