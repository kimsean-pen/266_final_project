Hey, yeah, no, oh, yeah, mmm, listen
Um, I used to dress like everybody else

I wanted to just blend in
They told me no, keep my dreams on the low
Told me I'd never win, yeah
I love to be different
Guard up to opinions then let 'em in
Tear me down, wanna see me drown
Like being happy is such a sin, uh-huh

And now I'm older, it's never over
It don't stop affecting me, the world keeps testing me
I'm getting on track with every knock back
On a bad day, I just gotta stay, stay, stay, stay

I stay clued up and I'm ready
To love the good and live the bad
C-c-clued up and now I get it
Just make the best of what you have
'Cause sometimes it's beauty, sometimes it's pain
Sometimes it's sunshine and sometimes it's rain
I'm c-c-clued up and now I get it
Just make the best of what you have
Whoa, oh, oh

Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa
C-c-clued up and now I get it
Just make the best of what you have

Invisible, I feel like I'm forgotten
Do you even notice me, yeah?
Work myself up, let the nerves take over

How I feel isn't what you see
I need control, don't know how to let it go
I need to learn to let it be, yeah
Gotta remember nothing lasts forever

So I'm just happy being me, oh

And when I'm older, it's never over
It don't stop affecting me, the world keeps testing me
I'm staying on track with every knock back
On a bad day, I just gotta stay, stay, stay, stay

I stay clued up and I'm ready
To love the good and live the bad
C-c-clued up and now I get it

Just make the best of what you have
'Cause sometimes it's beauty, sometimes it's pain
Sometimes it's sunshine and sometimes it's rain
I'm c-c-clued up and now I get it
Just make the best of what you have
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa

C-c-clued up and now I get it
Just make the best of what you have

I will never run, never run from a lesson
I will never hide, never hide from the present
All the ups and the downs
All the heres and the nows, oh
Everything I face, no, it's never forgotten
'Cause every single day is a chance I can blossom
All the ups and the downs
Yeah, I'm living right now, hey

Mmm, I'm living right now, yeah
1 2 3
I'm c-c-clued up and I'm ready
To love the good and live the bad
C-c-clued up and now I get it
Just make the best of what you have
'Cause sometimes it's beauty (beauty, no), sometimes it's pain (pain)
Sometimes it's sunshine and sometimes it's rain (oh, sometimes it's rain)
I'm c-c-clued up (up) and now I'm ready
Just make the best of what you have (sing)
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa
Whoa
I'm c-c-clued up and now I get it
Just make the best of what you have
Beauty, sometimes it's pain
Sometimes it's sunshine, sometimes it's rain
