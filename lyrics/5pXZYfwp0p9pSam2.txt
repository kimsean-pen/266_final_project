There's a pounding in my chest
It's getting hard to breathe
Morning's coming but not yet
So take your time with me
Whisper sweet and pull me close
Never let me go

You could stay here in my arms so tight
We could lay here in this perfect night
I could love you if you'd let me dear so stay right here
Stay right here
Right here

There's a fire in your eyes
Burning through the dark
And when your body's close to mine
The burning's in my heart
Kiss me sweet and whisper low
Never let me go
Never let me go

You could stay here in my arms so tight
We could lay here in this perfect night
I could love you if you'd let me dear so stay right here
Stay right here
Right here

There's a tremble in your voice
When you say my name
There's a weakness in my knees
And you're the one to blame
Love me sweet and love me slow
Never let me go

You could stay here in my arms so tight
We could lay here in this perfect night
I could love you if you'd let me dear so stay right here
Stay right here
Right here
