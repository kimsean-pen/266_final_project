It's alright now, I don't wanna wait
It's alright now, I don't wanna wait
It's alright now, I don't wanna wait
It's alright now, I don't wanna wait
Let me be your fortress
One word then all of this
If I pushed it all to the back
Would you run home just like that?
If you're not there today
It's alright now, I can wait
You cannot think of the cost
Burnt up like the day we lost
If only you could you see mine
Running out dry
Some of these feelings never died
I step onto your side
You never did see mine
Tell me are you sleeping still tonight
Is this the one
Is this the one
Is this the place where it all stems from
Where it had every right to become
Step away step away stay numb
Cause you weren't there today
It's alright now, I can wait
We cannot think of the cost
Burnt up like the days we lost
If only you could you see mine
Running out dry
Some of these feelings never died
I step onto your side
You never did see mine
Tell me are you sleeping still tonight
It's alright now, I don't wanna wait
It's alright now, I don't wanna wait
Made a plan to be someone
Mess it up when the moment comes
Step away step away stay numb
It's alright now, I don't wanna wait
Made a plan to be someone
Mess it up when the moment comes
Step away step away stay numb
It's alright now, I don't wanna wait
Made a plan to be someone
Mess it up when the moment comes
Step away step away stay numb
It's alright now, I don't wanna wait
Made a plan to be someone
Mess it up when the moment comes
Step away step away stay numb
It's alright now, I don't wanna wait
