I'm all out of things to say
You can't seem to look away
So you delay
You're making me hallucinate
I'm making you levitate
SÃ³ what are you waiting for now
Darling it's you move
I'm in you face
What does it take
Go ahead now go for it
Go ahead now go for it
Inches away
It's A-ok
Go ahead now go for it
Go ahead now go for it
I'm handing up in the air
I'll wait for you there
Or anywhere...
Bali or Timbuktu
Marianas or the moon
I will be waiting for you
Darling it's you move
I'm in your face
What does it take
Go ahead now go for it
Go ahead now go for it
Inches away
It's A-ok
Go ahead now go for it
Honey I won't read between the lines
Won't you make up your mind
Won't you make up your mind
You and I don't need a number nine
Won't make up your mind
Won't make up your mind
I'm in you face
What does it take
Go ahead now go for it
Go ahead now go for it
I'm in tour face
What does it take
Go ahead now go for it
Go ahead now go for it
Inches away
It's A-ok
Go ahead now go for it
Go ahead now go for it
