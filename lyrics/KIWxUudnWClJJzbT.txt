Sent unto the shore
Every grain of sand
Rivers quicken remembrance
Carried by a grace
Running in our veins
Ashes within clay
Shaped upon an earthen wheel
Pour into this vessel
Drained and filled again
Temple to a nameless soul
Beckoning my restless ghost

From holes in my gut
To love from miracles
Silver climbed the walls
Eyeless looking on
It's looking still
Drawn by a mortal thread
To an ever shifting weave
Known better by my bones
Than my eyes can see
Shrine to a silent call
Beckoning my restless ghost
My restless ghost
My restless ghost

Leaving
Nothing left behind
Breathing
Through my dark inside
The raw within
Ayni
Sent reverence
For what has been given
In this shared life
The raw within
