What the hell are you standing there for?
Expecting me to help you, when I'm down myself
Waiting my saviour

My world is flooding over
There's no room for air, I can't breathe
I would give a kingdom for one more day

I'd give a kingdom
For one more day as a king of your world
I'd give a kingdom for one more day

What the hell am I waiting here for?
Expecting you to come and give away your life
Just for a moment of my time

Have a hole where I should have a heart
I'm made of wood, I'm falling apart
I would give a kingdom for one more day

I'd give a kingdom
For one more day as a king of your world
I'd give a kingdom for one more day

I'd give it all for a heart
If I was a king I would give away my kingdom
Treasures and crowns wouldn't mean a thing
If I only had a heart, if I only had a heart

Now I know I will never love you
I'm man without a heart, I'm not allowed to feel human feelings
I'm king of the land, I'm a ruler of seas
I'd give it away in a moment
If I only had one moment

I'd give a kingdom
I'd give a kingdom
I'd give a kingdom to just one more day

I'd give it all for a heart
If I was a king I would give away my kingdom
Treasures and crowns wouldn't mean a thing
If I only had a heart

I'd give it all for a heart
If I was a king I would give away my kingdom
Treasures and crowns wouldn't mean a thing
If I only had a heart, if I only had a heart

I'd give it all for a heart
If I was a king I would give away my...
Treasures and crowns wouldn't mean a thing
If I only had a heart, if I only had a heart
