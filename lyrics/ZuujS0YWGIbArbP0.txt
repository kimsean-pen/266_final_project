Last hour to grasp, the free reign autonomy
Left to unravel the dominion that exists
Time ticking faster, all your plans a ruse
Usurper at the gates to deal with who resists

Columns of armor exit making haste
Abandoned bases scavenged almost bare, scoured
New tenants on the way making claim
Anarchy's short life-span to dissolve

Filling the void of exhausted power, axis of evil, you can never be free here
A power vacuum, unwelcomed chasm, needed order leads to countless beatings
Fall in line, in scheduled time, direction given so no need to worry
Free of choice, the puppet strings, dragged toward commanded stability

Cyclones of demise rip across the skies
Scorched Earth, dry lips quench dust, ingested pain
Bombs from the heavens randomly rain down
Lotto of the doomed is preordained

Ordered where to go, directed what to be
Restricted passage only, there's nowhere to flee
Impossible to track, predators amongst
Pursuing deadly killers, urban legend debunked
Martyr's families uphold, what you would be
National example, rank hypocrisy
Bones and blood and clothing, all that's left in debris
Race to paradise lost, fuck

Let all the sheep follow their supreme God
Back to the terrain of self-preservation

Territorial reflex is not what you feel
Nothing to protect but securing your next meal
Matched competition becomes the biggest threat
Targeting the rivals of survival

Strength in numbers of mindless disciples, obedience makes fanatical powerful
Sound of sonic boom panics, every last piece of shit
Lone wolves weave through battlefields, scavenging what's left behind
Standing as the only victors
Still alive with nothing to hide

Innate show of force
There's the food who's getting it?
Resilient survival
Anyone in the way will pay
Lawless territory made for one kind
Only one kind
The kind to thrive

Made for retribution
Ingrained tough resolve

Filling all the void of the exhausted power, it's an axis of evil so you can never be free here
A power vacuum is an unwelcomed chasm, needed order leads to countless beating
Fall in line within the scheduled time, direction given so no need to worry
Free of choice, feeling the puppet strings, dragged toward commanded stability
