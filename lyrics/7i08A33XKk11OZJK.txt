A NEW DAWN (lyrics)

No baby, you are not alone
You dont need to hold on
And this is your dawn
No thoughts, no feels, no cares,
Your voice only, only your voice

No baby you are not alone
You dont need to hold on
And this is your dawn
No thoughts, no feels, no cares,
Your voice only, only your voice
And this is a new dawn

Hold me, hold my hands
Hold me, to all the ¨game¨
Feel me, feel the ¨pain¨
Hold me,
And this is a new dawn

No baby you are not alone
You dont need to hold on
And this is your dawn
No thoughts, no feels, no cares,
Your voice only, only your voice

Hold me, hold my hands
Hold me,
And this is a new dawn

No thoughts, no feels, no cares,
Your voice
And this is a new dawn

No thoughts, no feels, no cares,
Your voice
And this is a new dawn
