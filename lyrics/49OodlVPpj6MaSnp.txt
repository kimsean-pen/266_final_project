Oh, I'm different now
Pill poppin' got me feelin' visceral
Melancholy girl, tell me where you're from
Why the fuck should I smile? I'm barely on

(Ooh get me higher)
Do this till you're fucking numb
(Like damn betchu riding)
Do this till you're fucking gone
(Ooh then I'm riding)
Do this till you're fucking numb
(Like damn let me ride out)
Do this till you're fucking gone
(Ooh get me higher)
Do this till you're fucking numb
(Like damn betchu riding)
Do this till you're fucking gone
(Ooh then I'm riding)
Do this till you're fucking numb
(Like damn let me ride out)
Do this till you're fucking gone

(Ooh get me higher)
Do this 'till you're fucking on with me
Leave it behind, it's all gone
If you really wanna let it go
Let it
You wanna feel something and that's fine
You gon' let him swallow up your pride?
You can come with me and just ride
We can do this till the night end
Cigarettes and pills burn your eyes
You can take off your disguises
He ain't worth the tears that you cry
All you wanna do is get high
That's okay, lets get high

(Ooh get me higher)
Do this till you're fucking numb
(Like damn betchu riding)
Do this till you're fucking gone
(Ooh then I'm riding)
Do this till you're fucking numb
(Like damn let me ride out)
Do this till you're fucking gone
(Ooh get me higher)
Do this till you're fucking numb
(Like damn betchu riding)
Do this till you're fucking gone
(Ooh then I'm riding)
Do this till you're fucking numb
(Like damn let me ride out)
Do this till you're fucking gone

Ooh get me higher
Like damn betchu riding
Ooh then I'm riding
Like damn let me ride out

Same kick with a new bass
Same bitch with a new face
Same dish with a new plate
Cookie cutter that's the new way
New friends think they knew me
Old friends act a new way
I've been getting it the hard way
They gon' find out the hard way
When she call me baby hit her with the Plan B, and that's plan a
Car straight from Japan, hands-free but ignore when she call me
I can't depend on nobody and everything that I've been doing, it's all me
Who the fuck gonna stall me
Who the fuck gonna stop me

I've been numb, I've been numb, I've been
I've been on, I've been on, I've been
