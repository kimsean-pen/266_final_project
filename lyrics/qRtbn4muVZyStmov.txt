Never thought I'd end up here
Now our future seems so clear
I can see the top of the world down here

Drawing on the window pane
Wanna hear them say my name
All I have are whispers and dreams down here

Nothing hurts more than saying I'm fine

Not a second to waste
Life won't wait for you now
This is our time to go

Feel the crash of the waves
Wash away all the thoughts
That come at you like monsters at night

I don't wanna live this way
Strong enough to break these chains
Broken pieces can mend

Not a second to waste
Life won't wait for you now
This is our time, our time to go

When I've got it figured out
All alone I get knocked down
Looking at the stars from the floor, down here

Can't be held down in this place
You can see it in my face
Wishing I could open the door, down here

Nothing hurts more than saying I'm fine

Not a second to waste
Life won't wait for you now
This is our time to go

Feel the crash of the waves
Wash away all the thoughts
That come at you like monsters at night

I don't wanna live this way
Strong enough to break these chains
Broken pieces can mend

Not a second to waste
Life won't wait for you now
This is our time, our time to go

Oh, oh, oh

I'm walking down this road
Nobody's hand to hold
Way past the point of no return
You strike a match, get burned

Not a second to waste
Life won't wait for you now
This is our time to go

Feel the crash of the waves
Wash away all the thoughts
That come at you like monsters at night

I don't wanna live this way
Strong enough to break these chains
Broken pieces can mend
(Broken pieces can mend)

Not a second to waste
Life won't wait for you now
This is our time, our time to go

Oh, oh, oh
Our time to go
Oh, oh, oh

Our time to go
