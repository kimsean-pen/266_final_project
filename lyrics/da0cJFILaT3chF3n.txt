It's enough for me, it's enough for me

Always the last to fall asleep
Always with a dream in mind
Carried the weight, but honestly
I still got left behind
You think it's easier to find
What's wrong than to figure it out
Tonight I'm gonna make you feel alive
(And that's what it's all about)

Because lately we've been all about our privacy
But we're not as alone as we would like to be
So take me to a place where it's just you and me
And you won't wanna go home

Oh no, I'm mixing up my words again
Who knows when I'll make a move but
She comes and she goes and she does what she's told
It's bittersweet, but it's enough for me
(It's enough for me, it's enough for me)

Always the first to make amends
Try to find that perfect score
The city's not the best place for me
But I keep coming back for more
You think it's easier to let all the madness pull you in
Tonight there's a fire inside you
(So let the flames begin)

Because lately we've been all about our privacy
But we're not as alone as we would like to be
So take me to a place where it's just you and me
And you won't wanna go home

Oh no, I'm mixing up my words again
Who knows when I'll make a move but
She comes and she goes and she does what she's told
It's bittersweet, but it's enough for me

So just know that you're heaven sent, not irrelevant
We're one in the same
And even when I'm across the Atlantic
I'm right where you're standing
So don't look down

Oh no, I'm mixing up my words again
Who knows when I'll make, when I'll make a move but
Oh no, I'm mixing up my words again
Who knows when I'll make a move but
She comes and she goes and she does what she's told
It's bittersweet, but it's enough for me
Yeah (It's enough for me, it's enough for me)
She comes and she goes and she does what she's told
It's bittersweet
