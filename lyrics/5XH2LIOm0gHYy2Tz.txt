Sitting here so close
together
So far we're just friends, but I'm wondering
whether

I
am I just imaginin'
you
do you really have a thing for me
Like I think I see when I see you smile
And your smile's for me
I gotta tell you

Hey! (hey!) You! (you!)
I wanna be your girlfriend
Trying to say I wanna be your number one
Hey! (hey!) You! (you!)
I wanna be your girlfriend
Gonna make you love me 'fore I'm done

Late at night when I
when I can't sleep
Picture in my mind
I see you and me

I'll, tell you what I wanna be
You, to say that you're in love with me
You know feels so good in a dream
That I know in life we just got to be
I gotta tell you

Hey! (hey!) You! (you!)
I wanna be your girlfriend
Trying to say I wanna be your number one
Hey! (hey!) You! (you!)
I wanna be your girlfriend
Gonna make you love me 'fore I'm done

Gonna make you love me
Yeah, I'm gonna make you love me
Yeah, I'm gonna make you love me
From now on

I
am I just imagining
you
Do you really have a thing for me
Like I think I see when I see you smile
And your smile's for me
I gotta tell you

Hey! (hey!) You! (you!)
I wanna be your girlfriend
Trying to say I wanna be your number one
Hey! (hey!) You! (you!)
I wanna be your girlfriend
Gonna make you love me 'fore I'm-

Hey! (hey!) You! (you!)
I wanna be your girlfriend
Hey! (hey!) You! (you!)
I wanna be your girlfriend
Hey! (hey!) You! (you!)
I wanna be your girlfriend

Gonna make you love me
Yeah, I'm gonna make you love me
Yeah, I'm gonna make you love me before I'm done
