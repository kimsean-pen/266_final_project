I felt happy when you said you don't need me
But I'm as happy as the number of lights
You need someone so completely
And I'm gone, running on strange time

And then socialize like it's a competition
Against people without school or girlfriends
In search of a faster way of moving
I give in, I won't outrun the train

But I can't understand why you're still trying
Oh, what you want, what I want
We forget over time
I'm trying to make time for life

Now it's the night before your birthday
I tried to paint you something, it didn't work out
I can see myself tomorrow
Telling you something you won't feel

But I can't understand why you're still trying
Oh, what you want, what I want
We forget over time
I'm trying to make time for life
I'm trying to make time for life
I'm trying to find time for life
And I'm trying to make time for life
