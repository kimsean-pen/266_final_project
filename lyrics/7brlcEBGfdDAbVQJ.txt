Well, I guess this is quite a mess that we got caught in
It's best if we just confess that we have fallen
And love is problematique when you feel
Like a fanatic of a person that you barely know

The trigger's been pulled, there's no use in running
So let's bite the bullet and take what we've got coming
Forget the contemplation situation's complicated
And I'm thinking we should let it roll

Let's take this wherever it goes and go
Places that nobody knows about
Anywhere I don't care, take me there
We'll take this where it goes

Okay, the way I feel is so surreal and heavy
On my mind all the time this thought is beating steady
Process is monotonous but baby it has gotten us
Everything we think we need

Our hearts they beat the same, there's no way to explain
Emotions when a sudden change causes you and me
It's ecstasy, you're next to me and gradually reality
Will soon begin to take control

Let's take this wherever it goes and go
Places that nobody knows about
Anywhere I don't care, take me there
We'll take this where it goes

We'll be
Strangers in this land
You and me
Together with no plan

Let's take this wherever it goes and go
Places that nobody knows about
Anywhere I don't care, take me there
We'll take this where it goes
