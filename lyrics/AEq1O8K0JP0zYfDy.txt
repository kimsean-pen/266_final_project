It's getting hard
I've been barely sleeping
Sleeping
It's creeping in

It's getting hard
We've been barely sneaking
Leaving
It's been keeping

But I know you wanna try
I can feel it in your sigh
Yeah, I know you wanna try
I can feel it in your sigh

It's getting hard
Don't know where this is leading
Repeating
The reasons

It's getting hard
Yeah, I don't know this feeling
This feeling
It's creeping in

Ah, ooh ah
Ah, ohh ah

'Cause I know you wanna try
I can feel it in your sigh
Yeah, I know you wanna try
I can feel it in your sigh

If only I could turn back time
I would, yeah I would
If only I could turn back time
I would, yeah I would

'Cause I know you wanna try
I can feel it in your sigh
Yeah, I know you wanna try
I can feel it in your sigh

Yeah, I know you wanna try
I can feel it in your sigh
Yeah, I know you wanna try
I can feel it in your sigh
