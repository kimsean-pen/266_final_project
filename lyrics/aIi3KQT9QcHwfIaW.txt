The moments in between the words I hear you speak
Desolate and clear, leave me feeling weak.
And I just want to see a beautiful world in my dreams.
But all I see is me in the center of all I see.
Now I feel like a constant, a world that is fading.
All I've been taught to recall simply fails to persuade me.
The attempts to stay while it heals,
And the only way back is screaming the words

Oh my God. What have I become.
I feel this fire burn.
Burn till' I'm undone, never to return.
Oh.

I remember when we were heaven sent
And stars that filled the sky drew a line between you and I.

Oh my God. What have I become?
I feel this fire burn.
Burn till' I'm undone, never to return.

I hear your voice reply as I clear myself inside.
To reduce that trusted with such a peculular fire.

Oh my God. What have I become?
I feel this fire burn.
Burn till' I'm undone, never to return.

There's nothing like living asleep it's a constant dream
With your eyes open see what they never see.
Like the first time that my gaze fell upon this place
I've felt shuttered to feed what I've become.
