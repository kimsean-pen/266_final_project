You can't find the feeling
All is the same in the pouring rain, y'know, y'know
Coming out of the ceiling
Falling from above, growing in and out of love

A broken heart is still beating
In and out of time, hold your body next to mine, y'know, y'know
But you can't stop the bleeding
Sing to yourself and hold on

'Cos everybody's on the run,
everybody's on the run

Hang in there love, you gotta hold on
Hang in there love, you gotta hold on

'Cos everybody's on the run,
everbody's on the run
Everybody's on the run,
everybody's on the run

You've been drifting and stealing
Trying to walk in my shoes, but they don't belong to you, no they don't
But you can't find the meaning
Sing to yourself and hold on

'Cos everybody's on the run, everybody's on the run

Hang in there love, you gotta hold on
Hang in there love, you gotta hold on

'Cos everybody's on the run

Hang in there love, you gotta hold on
Hang in there love, you gotta hold on

'Cos everybody's on the run,
everbody's on the run
Everybody's on the run,
everybody's on the run

Hang in there love, you gotta hold on
You gotta be strong enough for love, y'know, y'know
Hang in there love, you gotta hold on
You gotta be strong enough for love, y'know, y'know
Hang in there love, you gotta hold on
You gotta be strong enough for love, y'know, y'know
Hang in there love, you gotta hold on

'Cos everybody's on the run,
everbody's on the run
Everybody's on the run,
everybody's on the run"
