I don't hear your knock upon my door
I don't have your lovin' anymore
Since you been gone I'm hurtin' inside
Well, I want you, baby, by my side, yeah

I'm crying, I'm crying
Hear me crying, baby
Hear me crying

I'm lonely and blue, baby, every night
Yeah, you know, you didn't treat me right
And now my tears begin to fall
Well, I want you, baby and that's all

I'm crying, I'm crying
Hear me crying, baby
Hear me crying, hear me crying

I don't hear your knock upon my door
I don't have your lovin' anymore
Since you been gone I'm hurtin' inside, yeah
Well, I want you, baby, by my side
But I'm crying, you know I'm crying

Hear me crying, baby
Hear me crying
Hear me crying
