How sweet it is to be embraced by the air
A hundred ways around your freckles
They look so fine in the sun
To stare at you, to be held by your moves
Bring it on, darling
Burn for me real good

The way you bite your lips
The way you stare at me
The way you lay so fine
I like it when you're mean
The way you turn me on
The way you touch yourself
I doubt that it would change
The way you make me melt

Barefoot the great day is yet to come
When the truth reveals itself as one
Your shinny hair's been all over the sun
The youth and the great strings are just everyone

The way you bite your lips
The way you stare at me
The way you lay so fine
I like it when you're mean
The way you turn me on
The way you touch yourself
I doubt that it would change
The way you make me melt
