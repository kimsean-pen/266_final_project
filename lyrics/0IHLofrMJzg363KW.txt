How did I get here
Holding onto fear
I poured my love, you washed it down

You roll me up, I smoke you out

Called you up on your phone
Blast you off, put you at home
Time moves slow when you're alone

Pupils wide like you were rolling
Now our bodies moving in slow motion, yeah

I know you didn't ask for it
I know you didn't need my love
You thought you were immune to it
Now I've got you all fucked up
And I can tell you like it too
And if I fall, I fall with you
My veins are what you're running through, through through, through

And now I'm fucked up
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do

Haunted by the way
You take away the pain
The way you move, I'm mystified
You spark my fire, now we're burning bright

Called you up, on your phone
Blast you off, put you at home
Time moves slow when you're alone
Pupils wide like you were rolling
Now our bodies moving in slow motion, yeah

I know you didn't ask for it
I know you didn't need my love
You thought you were immune to it
Now I've got you all fucked up
And I can tell you like it too

And if I fall, I fall with you
My veins are what you're running through, through, through, through

And now I'm fucked up
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
And now I'm fucked up
Fucked up
Fucked up

I know you didn't ask for it
I know you didn't need my love
You thought you were immune to it
Now I've got you all fucked up
And I can tell you like it too
And if I fall, I fall with you
My veins are what you're running through, through, through, through
And now I'm fucked up
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
And now I'm fucked up
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
