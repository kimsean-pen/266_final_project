If you get out on the ocean
If you sail out on the sea
If you get up in the mountains
If you go climbing on trees
Or through every emotion
When you know that they don't care
Darling, that's when I'm with you
Oh, I'll go with you anywhere

If you get up in a jet plane
Or down in a submarine
If you get onto the next train
To somewhere you never been
If you wanna ride in a fast car
And feel the wind in your hair
Darling just look beside you
Oh, I'll go with you anywhere

Oh, and I will be with you
When the darkest winter comes
Oh, and I will be with you
To feel the California sun
Oh, and I will be with you
In the night sound and it's true
Oh, I'll go anywhere with you

If you get up in the hillside
If you ride out on the planes
If you go digging up dirt
If you go out dancing in the rain
If you go chasing in rainbows
Just to find the gold end there
Darling just look behind you
Oh I'll go with you anywhere

Oh, and I will be with you
When the darkest winter comes
Oh, and I will be with you
To feel the California sun
Oh, and I will be with you
In the night sound and it's true
Oh, I'll go anywhere with you

Yeah I'll go anywhere with you

Oh, and I will be with you
When the darkest winter comes
Oh, and I will be with you
To feel the California sun
Oh, and I will be with you
In the night sounds and it's true
Oh, darling I swear I'll go anywhere with you

Oh I'll go anywhere with you
Oh I'll go anywhere with you
Oh I'll go anywhere with you
Oh I'll go anywhere with you
