Who can tell you
The promise of you
Will you
Live up to
The promise of you

Gotta stop
Say a prayer
I'm in shock
can't believe you just said
I'm nothing
Who are you
Judging me
'cause I don't think like you
Awhoo whoo whoo
Awhoo whoo whoo

Who can tell you
The promise of you
The beautiful flower
That just hasn? t bloomed
you're judging the surface
But what's growing inside
Just might amaze you

Bring it on
I'm prepared
Say I can't
But I don't even care
Doing things
You couldn't dream
So just watch
While I keep doin' me
Awhoo whoo whoo
Awhoo whoo whoo
Awhoo whoo whoo
Awhoo whoo whoo
Say a prayer

don't recreate me as a clone
won't accept no as I go
Gotta vision all my own
I'll control
The promise of you (spoken)

Call me strange
I'm unique
No disrespect
I dance to my own beat
'cause I know
it's up to me
Yeah to be
The promise I vow to keep
Awhoo whoo whoo
Awhoo whoo whoo
Awhoo whoo whoo
Awhoo whoo whoo
