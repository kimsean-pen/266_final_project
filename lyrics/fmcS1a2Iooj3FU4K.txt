Lunar

somebody slipped it out to save the long gone wrong
without a simple way to paint it all unsure
I never met him in life but don't think that I could
the letter met us in jest to take it back for good

like a rook to fool
see all my rays on fog
we said

about the way to pass
lay it flat for good
in vain

the crooked stream
I would row away if I could

the mountain top
try to reach my end

it's not there for you
