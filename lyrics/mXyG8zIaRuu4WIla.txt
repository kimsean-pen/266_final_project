I'm not sorry that I can't take back all the things I've done in the past
nowhere to run, live my life for no one
TUI what's done is done
it's done, it's done, I'm done
I'll always be haunted by my past
can't change your view
can't change the things that I do
can't say that I want to
what's right for me might not be right for you
I've lost count of how many times I've had to apologize for doing the right thing
I'm through with doing the right thing
fighting to survive with no remorse
I've got empty hands, all I want is more
all I want is what I deserve and what I've earned
you won't reap the benefits of what I earn
still alive, TUI
TUI, until I die
