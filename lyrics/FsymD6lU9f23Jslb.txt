I remember when you lost your head
Sometimes I wonder how you stay so sad
When you're so beautiful
I remember every word you said
How you were scared because you'd never been
Somewhere so beautiful
So beautiful

So tell me why we're talking when we dance so good
So tell me why we're talking when we dance so good
I know you can't stay
But I wish you would
Yeah, I wish you would
Yeah, I wish you would

Now you tell me that you're on the mend
Sometimes I wonder how you don't go mad
When you're so beautiful
So beautiful
So beautiful
So beautiful

So tell me why we're talking when we dance so good
So tell me why we're talking when we dance so good
I know you can't stay
But I wish you would
Yeah, I wish you would
Yeah, I wish you would

I remember when you lost your head
Sometimes I wonder how you stay so sad
When you're so beautiful
You're so beautiful
So beautiful
So beautiful
So beautiful
So beautiful

So tell me why we're talking when we dance so good
So tell me why we're talking when we dance so good
I know you can't stay
But I wish you would
Yeah, I wish you would
Yeah, I wish you would
