I keep staring at the sky
I've been waiting for some time
So out of touch
So out of mind
I can feel you there, I won't lie
We're all just kids
We're all good liars
Good liars...

Please try to understand
There is no great plan
We have no idea
What lies beyond our reach
Try to understand
There is no great plan
We will cross the line
With an open mind

Show me what it is
Hush my desires
Set me on fire

Please try to understand
There is no great plan
We have cast our lies
To the open skies
Try to understand
We've another plan
We have crossed the line
With an open mind

We have crossed that line

You're new to me
And I believe
You have to be
The one we need

Soon you will see it with all
Our reasons for trying to justify
We hold the fate of the world
The dearly departed
They won't make a sound
They won't make a sound

You are the same as us all
Blood running in our veins
Few have the heart of a brave,
Now will you run or stay?
We hide away our vicious things
Don't let them out
Even the ones that we don't see
Who are always there

You are the salt of all

You are the salt of the same blood running in our veins
Few have the heart of the brave
Now, will you run or stay?
We hide away our vicious things
Don't let them out
Even the ones that we don't see
Who are always there

You're new to me
And I believe
You have to be
The one we need

Take me with you on your sky machine
(Please try to understand, there is no great plan)
I'm dying to know
(We have cast our lies to the open skies)
Way out far from what it is we see
(Try to understand, we've another plan
We have crossed the line with an open mind)

Soon you will see it with all
Our reasons for trying to justify
We hold the fate of the world
The dearly departed
They won't make a sound
They won't make a sound
