In the middle of a gun fight
In the center of a restaurant
They say,
"Come with your arms raised high!"

Well they're never gonna get me
I'm like a bullet through a flock of doves
To wage this war against your faith in me,
Your life
Will never be the same.
On your mother's eyes, say a prayer
Say a prayer!

Now,
But I can't
And I don't know
How we're just two men as God had made us
Well, I can't
Well, I can!
Too much, too late
Or just not enough of this
Pain in my heart for your dying wish
I'll kiss your lips again.

They all cheat at cards and the checkers are lost,
My cellmate's a killer
They make me do push-ups in drag
But nobody cares if you're losing yourself...
Am I losing myself?!
Well, I miss my Mom!
Will they give me the chair?
Or lethal injection, or swing from a rope if you dare
Oh, nobody knows all the trouble I've seen

Now,
But I can't
And I don't know
How we're just two men as God had made us
Well, I can't
Well, I can!
Too much, too late
Or just not enough of this
Pain in my heart for your dying wish
I'll kiss your lips again.

To your room
What they ask of you
They'll make you want to say
"So long..."
Well, I don't remember
Why remember
You!

Do you have the keys to the hotel?!
'Cause I'm gonna string this motherfucker on fire!
FIRE!

Instrumental

Life is but a dream for the dead,
And well I, I won't go down by myself,
But I'll go down with my friends.
Now, now, now, now
I can't explain it,
Now, yeah yeah!
I can't complain it
Now now now.
Now now now.
