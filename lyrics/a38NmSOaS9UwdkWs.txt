This feeling sits inside my soul
Don't know when it took control
Entangled in with all the rest

But this will drive me from my home
And leave me all alone
I don't think twice before them all
Don't feel anything at all

And this will drive me from my home
And leave me all alone
I don't think twice before them all
Don't feel anything at all

This feeling sits inside my soul
Don't know when it took control
Entangled in with all the rest
I can't take the past
