You say I owe you nothin'
If I could I'd give you the world
You make somethin' from nothin
I thank God for such a beautiful girl
He brought in this world, yeah

I remember when I left home in that pearl Cadillac
I was searching for some kinda way to pay you back
For your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love
Well I won't let you down, I'ma make you proud

You say money ain't everything
You could've made it on your own
Now I understand your sacrifice
Late nights, fussing and fighting at home
I'm sorry for the things I did wrong

I remember when I left home in that pearl Cadillac
I was searching for some kinda way to pay you back
For your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love
Well I won't let you down
I'ma make you proud

I don't wanna let you down
Oh, I only wanna make you proud

You say I owe you nothing
If I could I'd give you the world
You made something from nothin
I thank God for such a beautiful girl
He brought in this world, yeah
