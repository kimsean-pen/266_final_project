I can get you there, it ain't too far from here
On your side, let's take a ride, I'm a metallic engineer
So murder is a sin, but weapons set you free
Just hop on in, I'm gonna take you there, you're a lot like me!

Beats waiting on the corner
Your hand jammed down your pants
Take a ride, take a look, take a chance now, baby
A breakdown circumstance

Stand and pledge allegiance
To the air, the land, the sea
Take a ride, take a look, take a chance now, baby
You're a lot like me

Can't you see you're a lot like me
Can't you see it was meant to be
Can't you see you're a lot like me
Can't you see, can't you see

I'll be your conscious, I'll be your guide
I'll be the black-hand that stops your genocide
I'll be the understanding, undisputed power
I'll hold your hand in this our finest hour

I'll be your conscious, I'll be your guide
I'll be the black-hand that stops your genocide
I'll be the understanding, undisputed power
I'll hold your hand in this our finest hour

Hang on to the handle, we're just about to land
Lock and load, feel the road, keep it close at hand
So murder is a sin, to some it's just a game
Don't make a sound, low to the ground, I know we are the same

Beats waiting for that maybe
Ya finger up your nose
Take a ride, take a look, take a chance now, baby
And strike that bad ass pose

They haven't got a snowball's chance
Once they know your name
Take a ride, take a look, take a chance now, baby
I know we are the same

Can't you see you're a lot like me
Can't you see it was meant to be
Can't you see you're a lot like me
Can't you see we were meant to be
Meant to be, meant to be

I'll be your conscious, I'll be your guide
I'll be the black-hand that stops your genocide
I'll be the understanding, undisputed power
I'll hold your hand in this our finest hour

I'll be your conscious, I'll be your guide
I'll be the black-hand that stops your genocide
I'll be the understanding, undisputed power
I'll hold your hand, I'll hold your hand
I'll hold your hand, I'll hold your hand

Somebody call to the EMS
Somebody call to the priest
Somebody lay out a blessing on the soul of the deceased
Somebody dearly departed was not praying to the beast
Somebody call our finest hour on the soul of the deceased

I'm not going easy in the light of all this power
I'm not going easy in this our finest hour

I'll be your conscious, I'll be your guide
I'll be the black-hand that stops your genocide
I'll be the understanding, undisputed power
I'll hold your hand in this our finest hour

I'll be your conscious, I'll be your guide
I'll be the black-hand that stops your genocide
I'll be the understanding, undisputed power
I'll hold your hand, I'll hold your hand

I'll be your conscious, I'll be your guide
I'll be the black-hand that stops your genocide
I'll be the understanding, undisputed power
I'll hold your hand in this our finest hour

I'll be your conscious, I'll be your guide
I'll be the black-hand that stops your genocide
I'll be the understanding, undisputed power
I'll hold your hand, I'll hold your hand in this our finest hour
