Everybody wants to know, how to dream and how to flow
Living life remote control so I can turn into you
Grass is green around the edge, of a land so far from mine
Just another road to climb, so I can be like

You waking up from a logical love affair
Always with reason, and heading for somewhere
Me lost in daydreams and wonderful nightmares
Swimming in oceans and laughing like millionaires

Something in the river has a hold of me
Could it be the water?
Na na na na na na na
Something in the river it has taken me
All across the oceans
Na na na na na na na

Every morning with the sun drink a coffee on the run
No more standing in the shade, this game has never been played
When a thousand miles away living like a cabaret
Throwing shades of silver grey, so I can be like

You waking up from a logical love affair
Always with reason, and heading for somewhere
Me lost in daydreams and wonderful nightmares
Swimming in oceans and laughing like millionaires

Something in the river has a hold of me
Could it be the water?
Na na na na na na na
Something in the river it has taken me
All across the oceans
Na na na na na na na

Something in the river has a hold of me
Could it be the water?
Na na na na na na na
Something in the river it has taken me
All across the oceans
Na na na na na na na
