My hope is on fire
My dreams are for sale
I dance on the wire
But don't want to fail her

Walk against the stream
Fight for what I believe in
I run towards the end
Trying not to give up

She lost in the darkness, fading away
I'm still around here screaming her name
She haunting my dream world try to survive
My heart is frozen, i'm losing my mind
Help me I'm buried alive, buried alive

I'm burning the bridges
And there's no return
I'm trying to reach her
I feel that she yearns

Walk against the stream
Fight for what I believe in
I run towards the end
Trying not to give up

She lost in the darkness, fading away
I'm still around here screaming her name
She haunting my dream world try to survive
My heart is frozen, i'm losing my mind
Help me I'm buried alive, buried alive

I try to revive what's hold'n me down
They think i'm a fool, can't realize
Hope fates awaken, Can't win their mind
Coz I thought that love would fly
I can not revive what already down
She won't come around

She lost in the darkness, fading away
I'm still around here screaming her name
She haunting my dream world try to survive
My heart is frozen, i'm losing my mind
Help me I'm buried alive, buried alive
