This is the right time to believe in love

Everyone knows
If you don't demand, it shows
That you understand the light
Shining inside us

It's more than tonight
It's forever more, it's right
When there's someone there till the light
To hold you close

You know it's all you will ever need
'Cause you're seeing love and seeing it clearly
There's no doubt about it, you just have to shout out

This is the right time
This is the right time
(I can see it in your eyes)
This is the right time to believe in love

Everyone knows
It's a special thing, it's a love
That will never, ever be wrong
'Cause this love is strong

You know it's all you will ever need
'Cause you're seeing love and seeing it clearly
There's no doubt about it, you just have to shout out

This is the right time
This is the right time
(I can see it in your eyes)
This is the right time to believe in love

This is the right time
This is the right time
(I can see it in your eyes)
This is the right time to believe in love

So when you know
That there's someone that you want
And you want them so tonight
More than you've ever done anyone

You know it's all you will ever need
'Cause you're seeing love and seeing it clearly
There's no doubt about it, you just have to shout out

This is the right time
This is the right time
(I can see it in your eyes)
This is the right time to believe in love

This is the right time
This is the right time
(And I can see it in your eyes)
This is the right time to believe in love

Well, do you believe, baby?
'Cause I believe, baby
Do you believe, baby?
Believe in love

This is the right time
This is the right time
This is the right time to believe in love
