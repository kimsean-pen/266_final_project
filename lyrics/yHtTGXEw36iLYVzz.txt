In a world full of secrets
Guarded by a plagiarizing heart
I still can't believe you'd keeps yours with me

Half a world between us
Half a world to cut and paste away
Gravity will bring our orbits together

I think we both can see our own gravity
Is keeping our orbits in place
We've been around the sun together as one
Keeping up a furious pace
Leader of the pack in the chase

I know I can make a mess of things
When I wish on Saturn's rings
Our love can't be seen by the naked eye

By now we both can see our own gravity
Is keeping our orbits in place
We've been around the sun together as one
Leader of the pack in the chase
Breaking our necks in this race

Never stopping when we oughta
Breathing you back into my lungs
Never stopping where we oughta
You're my other half

I could fall in love with you again
In love with you it's all brand new
Never thought that this would happen to me

I think we both can see our gravity
Is keeping our orbits in place
We've been around the sun together as one
Breaking our necks in this race
Leader of the pack in the chase
