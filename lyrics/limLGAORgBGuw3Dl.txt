Rain is pouring
The wind is howling
The skies are dark and dim
Something's got a hold on you
And drains you from within
Tangled up
In a world of sorrow
You lost believe
In a better tomorrow
Don't surrender, stand your ground
Time to turn around

Burn down the bridges
And leave it all behind
Turn on the music
Let it purify your mind

Shout it out
And play it loud
Cause this is what it's all about
Heavy Metal - Heavy Metal never dies
Heavy Metal never dies!

Raise your head up to the sky
And let the music take you high
May your inner warrior
Ride again in pride

Burn down the bridges
And leave it all behind
Turn on the music
To purify your mind

Shout it out
And play it loud
Cause this is what it's all about
Heavy Metal - Heavy Metal never dies
Heavy Metal never dies!

[Solo]

And by the power of Metal
You'll be strong
To become yourself again
To finally go on and on

Burn down the bridges
And leave it all behind
Turn on the music
Let it purify your mind

Shout it out
And play it loud
Cause this is what it's all about
Heavy Metal - Heavy Metal never dies
Heavy Metal never dies!
[repeat]
