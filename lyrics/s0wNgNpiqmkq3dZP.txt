Glass hailed from the sky that night.
I couldn't hide to save my life.
Standing drenched in open wounds.
You took my hand, and pulled me through.

I want to give you everything.
I'll give you, my all, because you gave me
You gave me your lips, a gentle kiss.

The medicine to cure my pain.
Listen to all this glass shatter.
Once peirced my ears and made them bleed.

Now it sounds so beautiful
Cause you're you're beatiful
You're beautiful.

I want to give you everything.
I'll give you my all, because you gave me
You gave me your lips, a gentle kiss.
The medicine to cure my pain.
I want to give you everything.
I'll give you my all, because you gave me
You gave me your lips, a gentle kiss.
The medicine to cure my pain.
