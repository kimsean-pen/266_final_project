Rarely seen
As result of confidence
Gains derived from destruction
Two easy ways out will collide

Pick your fight
Stand you ground
Common way
Though unsound

Withered words
Say no more
Tend your wounds
End this war

Hostile tradition
Hard to convert
Primitive instinct to fight
Vindictive reason
Enmity profound
Fundamental spite

How many souls is success meant to pay?
Who will be left to take part?
Where can defeat be the final accord?
What will it do to your heart?

Withered words
Say no more
Tend your wounds
End this war
