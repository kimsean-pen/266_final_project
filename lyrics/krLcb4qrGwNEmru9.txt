Summoning the kings of the four infernal winds
Presiding over denizens of their vast domains
Samael and Azazel stand in the circle drawn
Mahazael and Azael, the demon triangle strong
Asmodai spits flames of hell
Three-headed abysmal king
Head of bull, man, and ram
Riding a dragon from the pits

Black magic conjurations through infernal spells
In pursuit of hidden knowledge of the outer realms
Request communication through the infernal names
Triangle and circle draw the demon's gate
Ritual evocation of Bael
Fierce ruler of legions from hell
Spirit apparition with a hoarse voice
Wear his demon sign to call him forth

The infernal inner sanctum will abide
Shadow realm of the demonic mind

Mighty duke called Astaroth
Viper held in his right hand
Rider of draconian beast
Shielding from his fiery breath

Full infernal splendour
Chariot in flames
Risen in the fire
Legions apostate
Chariot of Belial
Unleash my lawless hate

The infernal inner sanctum will abide
Shadow realm of the demonic mind

Keys to the forbidden depths of the mind
Externalize to assume control
Over mundane worlds and occult spirit realms
Psychomancer of the will
Astral ascent and infernal descent
In unholy union bound
Sorcerer's exertion of Thelemic will
Expressed by sigil, ring, and wand

Full infernal splendour
Chariot in flames
Risen in the fire
Legions apostate
Chariot of Belial
Unleash my lawless hate
