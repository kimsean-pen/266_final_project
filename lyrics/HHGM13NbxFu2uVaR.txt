Landed on the hilltop, soviet forces are in place
Awaiting orders!
They were only thirty-nine
They were told to hold the line, in control
Sent into battle
Came from the sky
Trapped on a mountain
And into the fire

Hold your ground
When you're fighting those who fight
Death is waiting on the hill
No surrender, shoot to kill
You have to hold your ground
Kill the warrior in your sight
Death is waiting on the hill
No surrender, shoot to kill

January 7th, hold the hilltop at all costs
Follow orders!
Holding their ground
To the final round, one by one
Fight through the sundown
Into the night
Enduring the darkness
Awaiting the light

Hold your ground
When you're fighting those who fight
Death is waiting on the hill
No surrender, shoot to kill
You have to hold your ground
Kill the warrior in your sight
Death is waiting on the hill
No surrender, shoot to kill

Stand, hold your ground
Come around
Hostile land
Your last stand

Under fire, low on munitions
Make your bullets count
Push their warriors back down the mountain
Rule the battlefront

Sent into battle
Came from the sky
Trapped on a mountain
And into the fire

Hold your ground
When you're fighting those who fight
Death is waiting on the hill
No surrender, shoot to kill
You have to hold your ground
Kill the warrior in your sight
Death is waiting on the hill
No surrender, shoot to kill
