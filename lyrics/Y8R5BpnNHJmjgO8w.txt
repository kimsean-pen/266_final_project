I just wanna touch you with my bleeding heart
I don't wanna skip past every little moment

I don't wanna be wrapped up in these pieces
I don't wanna be wrapped up in these pieces
Nobody is chasing us
Nobody is running

I hold my tongue so I don't repeat myself
Instead I beat myself
I don't wanna sit here thinking about you tonight
I don't wanna know what's wrong and what's right

I don't wanna be wrapped up in these pieces
I don't wanna be wrapped up in these pieces
Nobody is chasing us
Nobody is running

I don't wanna be wrapped up in these pieces
(I don't wanna be wrapped up in these pieces)
I don't wanna be wrapped up in these pieces
(I don't wanna be wrapped up in these pieces)
Nobody is chasing us
(Nobody is chasing us)
Nobody is running
