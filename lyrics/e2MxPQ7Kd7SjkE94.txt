Don't close your eyes they'll never wake you
You're into the nightmare
Beware the dreaded sleep don't let it take you
For this is the nightmare

Your mind begins to drift away
You try to fight but now you know it's too late
The power's to great
Your losing control they've taken your soul

You're into the nightmare
This nightmare may take your life tonight
You're into the nightmare
This nightmare may take your life tonight

Spirits on the wall they're growing taller
You're into the nightmare
The madcap voice that moans for you to follow
Into the nightmare

Run for your life no place to go
The naked truth is now on show to us all
You've taken a fall
The phantoms of night your too weak to fight

You're into the nightmare
This nightmare may take your life tonight
You're into the nightmare
This nightmare may take your life tonight

Out of the dead of night they came into the nightmare
Out of the dead of night they came into the nightmare
Out of the dead of night they came into the nightmare
Out of the dead of night they came into the nightmare

Your mind begins to drift away
You try to fight but now you know it's too late
The power's to great
Your losing control they've taken your soul

You're into the nightmare
This nightmare may take your life tonight
You're into the nightmare
This nightmare may take your life tonight
