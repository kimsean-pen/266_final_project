I feel good when I'm at home
Especially when I'm alone
I watch Mezzi stare at the shed
Play guitar on my bed
But I feel best by the lake
At my dads house I can take
That old bike that my mom
Left behind a very long long time ago
So stand still
Don't you wanna be a part of something bigger
Something strange
Is catching up to you
My old friends come say hi
When I'm in town, they stop by
We're still the same
But we are grown
And we'd all rather just go home
My new friends, they're okay
Not that social anyway
I thought that he would never hit a girl
But I guess you never know
And that's the world
So stand still
Don't you wanna be a part of something bigger
Something strange is catching up to you
Think about it all the time I get so
So far ahead, so far behind
So stand still
Don't you wanna be a part of something bigger
Something...
