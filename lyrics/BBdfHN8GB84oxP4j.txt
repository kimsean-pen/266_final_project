Holy Moses, I have been removed
I have seen the specter, he was been here too
Distant cousin from down the line
Brand of people who ain't my kind
Holy Moses, I have been removed

Holy Moses, I have been deceived
Now the wind has changed direction
I think I'll have to leave
Won't you please excuse my frankness
But it's not my cup of tea
Holy Moses, I have been deceived, yes I have

I'm going back to the border
Where my affairs, my affairs ain't abused
I can't take any more bad water
I've been poisoned from my head down to my shoes
Yes I have

Holy Moses, I have been deceived
Holy holy

Holy Moses, can we live in peace
Let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease
There's a man standin' over there
What's his color do you care, oh

Holy holy holy Moses
Can we live in peace?
Lord help them out
Holy holy holy Moses
Can we live in peace?
Holy holy holy Moses
Can we live?

I wonder can we can we can we live in peace
