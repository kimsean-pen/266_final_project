In the same time and space
I can't seem to rearrange
Love underneath my thumb
Trying to have someone
Under cathedral lungs
Dropping the ball again
To see what it means to you (Calm down, baby)

Feel it coming around
I don't why it moves me
Playing our games on
Every floor in Irving

Mouth of Old China sings
Lace made of mercury
Lost in the frozen can (Calm down, baby)
Somewhere in that great eye (Calm down, baby)

Feel it coming around
I don't why it moves me
Playing our games on
Every floor in Irving

I was blind
I was blind
But trying to see you makes me feel better

Feel it coming around
I don't why it moves me
Playing our games on
Every floor in Irving

Feel it coming around
I don't why it moves me
Playing our games on
Every floor in Irving

Ooh Calm down, baby
Ooh Calm down, baby
Ooh Calm down, baby
Ooh Calm down, baby
