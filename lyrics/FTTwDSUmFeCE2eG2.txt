No risk, no fun
I'm here, you're gone
I'm cool, you're hot
I love you not
Don't say a word
Unless you're heard
I know I hate to see you rude

I think I'll let you down
You should have let me go
I think I'll make you leave
'Cause you have lost control

You've pushed the line too far
Bye-bye
Turn over, there's no need to try
You waste your time
You're absolutely useless, baby

I think I'll let you down
You should have let me go
I think I'll make you leave
'Cause you have lost control
