I know there's hurt
I know there's pain
But people change
Lord knows I've been no saint
In my own way
Regret choices I made
How do I say I'm sorry
How do I say I'm sorry

I was scared
I was unprepared
Ohh, for the things you said
If I could undo that I hurt you
I would do anything
For us to make it through

Draw me a smile
And save me tonight
I am a blank page
Waiting for you to bring me to life

Paint me a heart
Let me be your eye
I am a blank page
Waiting for life to start
Then our heart's start
And beat as one together
Then our heart's start
And beat as one forever

How can I erase
Decisions I've made
How do I go back
What more can I say
All that remains
Are hearts filled with shame
They how do we say we're sorry
How do we say we're sorry

I was scared
I was unprepared
Ohh, for the things you said
If I could undo that I hurt you
I would do anything
For us to make it through

Draw me a smile
And save me tonight
I am a blank page
Waiting for you to bring me to life

Paint me a heart
Let me be your eye
I am a blank page
Waiting for life to start

Then our heart's start
And beat as one together
Then our heart's start
And beat as one forever
(Then our heart's stop)
I go back in time
And I realize
Our spirits alike
And we never die

Draw me a smile
And save me tonight
I am a blank page
Waiting for you to bring me to life

Ohh, paint me a heart
Let me be your eye
I am a blank page
Waiting for life to start
Then our heart's start
And beat as one together
Then our heart's start
And beat as one... forever
