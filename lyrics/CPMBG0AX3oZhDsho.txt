Dwindling down our speech was hardly sound
We've been up and all around
Just to find us here
Keep it in mind, ourselves will surely die
In the softest leaves we lie
We both saw the end come

Answer no questions, this time
Until tomorrow comes
Welcome to evenings with me
Until tomorrow comes

Dwindling down it's me the snow has found
It's been up and all around
Just to find me here
Keep it in mind myself will surely lie
In the softest leaves i lie
I saw my own end

Answer no questions, this time
Until tomorrow comes
Welcome to evenings with me
Until tomorrow comes

Until tomorrow
