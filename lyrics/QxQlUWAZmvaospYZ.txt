From the hill I've been watching stealing the light.
In my dreams I touch animal blood
Rich earth, swallow it down deep into my soul

It feeds her war and raises my true nature
When I awake I am whole
All the gods are screaming

My feet of clay lead me on through the void and far beyond
To demonstrate my will and path
To embrace the wolf in her glory

All hail her and wash this time in blood
The horizon will burn
Rise in fire and return to us
