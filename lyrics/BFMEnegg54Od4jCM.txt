So you say that you're going to a Hawaiian party
And I need to hear what you're wearin' to the party
So you say that you're going to a Hawaiian party
But I don't want to see your photos, you know it bores me

You never feel like going downtown, do you?
You flew north for winter and now you've got the blues

I wish you wouldn't tell me
About your Hawaiian party
I wish you wouldn't tell me
About your Hawaiian party

On Monday, you'll tell me about your Hawaiian party
I'll hear what you drank and if you danced at the party
I will know the details like I was at this party
I don't want to see your photos, you know it bores me

You never feel like going downtown, do you?
You flew north for winter and now you've got the blues

I wish you wouldn't tell me
About your Hawaiian party
I wish you wouldn't tell me
About your Hawaiian party

You never break out to the freeway do you
You never wanna do these things now do you
You never feel like going downtown do you
You flew north for winter and now you've got the blues

I wish you wouldn't tell me
About your Hawaiian party
I wish you wouldn't tell me
About your Hawaiian party

I wish you wouldn't tell me
About your Hawaiian party
I wish you wouldn't tell me
About your Hawaiian party
