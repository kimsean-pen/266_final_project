Green trees lighting HD
Green trees, green leaves I do safely yeah
Green Green, I can tell that she must hate me
Green face is it jealousy or envy?

Take green yeah they see through
Dishes green like a salad and your seafood
Different colored pills, I got orange, red, green, blue
I would pick green but she wouldn't let me choose

Green eyes matching green shoes
Suicide got me hanging from a green noose, seem to
Green lime, green juice
Used to pat the lil' fucker call it green goose

You'll see soon
I just had to flex, I ain't mean to
I ain't mean to
I'm just just sorry we don't cast thought

We just hit that green green green where I grew up
We smoke trees in the back of the tour bus
Green frames in their eyes they excite me
I sent her green sexts though she still wants to get inside me
I'm sorry

Green green were I grew up
Pop beads in the back til' you throw up
I sip lean on occasion, when my throat's fucked
It's just me making an appetite of most drugs

Can you face out?
You're gon' wanna see this, pull your face out
Yeah
Said you don't know but you know now

All I see is green yuh
Moving on your seat yuh yuh yuh
All I see is green, All I see is green, All I see is green

It's green where the grass grows
Let the cash flow
You can keep your head high, keep that ass low

Let the meds talk then I know their head's off
I done popped too many pills, made my dick soft

Matter of fact, she's the one who got attached
She likes money, she likes rock hey
Seven lines to be exact
You can fucking check the stats if you wanna take it back yuh

You'll see soon
I just had to flex, I ain't mean to
I ain't mean to
I'm just sorry we don't cash checks

We just hit that green green green where I grew up
She just popped an addy, well I guess that makes the two of us
Terror, terror I'm a flag at TSA
And I go stupid on the beat if I produce it in a day
You a lame though

Green green, now you're shooting from the neck down
Talk loud, I might rip your fucking throat out
Hometown, the city that'll wear your bones out
Talking like your paranoia bitch, I'm xaned out

Pop beads in the back 'til you throw up
I sip lean on occasion, when my throat's fucked
This is just me making an appetite of most drugs
