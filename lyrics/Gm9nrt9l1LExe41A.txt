You make me so high
You bring me alive
So high

Everything I want
Everything I need
I found in you
No matter what they say
I'm gonna find a way
To be with you
Take me to the place of sweet love
Do you realize what you do to me?

You make me so high
You bring me alive
So high
So high

Bring me back
Bring me back around
I'm holding on to what I can't have
Make it last
Make it last a while
You help me up when I'm down
Down, down

You make me so high
You bring me alive
So high (you make me)
So high (feel so high)
