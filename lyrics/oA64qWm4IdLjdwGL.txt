Have you ever been inside a flame?
Did you ever play a burning game?
Would you do what I want you to do?
Do you like the way I'm burning you?

Close to the flame
Behind my eyes there is a beast
that longs for you
Calling my name
So if you're brave enough to risk it
follow me
Into the firestorm

There's no need to be afraid of this
Let me melt you with my dragon-kiss
Let me walk with you the firing line
Put your burn onto the heart of mine

Close to the flame
Behind my eyes there is a beast
that longs for you
Calling my name
So if you're brave enough to risk it
follow me
Into the firestorm

(I. Will. Burn. You.)

Yesterday I had a flaming dream
We were swimming in a lava stream
We were watching an exploding sun
Counting sparkles until they were gone

Close to the flame
Behind my eyes there is a beast
that longs for you
Calling my name
So if you're brave enough to risk it
follow me
Into the firestorm
