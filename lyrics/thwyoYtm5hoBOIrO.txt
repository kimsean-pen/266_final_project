All the people on the village green
Are gathered round their tv screens
To hear the government about speak
About solider boys and jesus freaks

They go on heaven on their holidays
The congregation hopes and prays
They leave their letters in the mail box
For lonely souls they could not save

Off and on i used hear the call
But she was just a baby doll
And all around them were the holy men
Who twist the word of way back when

She will kiss the sky
And shelter the world from the rail

Put another record record on the jukebox
She might dance the night away

On and on we go
And the rest of the world outside
God may soon explode
And there is no place we might hide

On and on we go
And the rest of the world outside
God may soon explode
And there is no place we might hide

On and on we go
And we kiss this world behind
Goodbye and on and on and on and on

All the people on the village green
Are gathered round their tv screens
To hear the government about speak
About solider boys and jesus freaks
