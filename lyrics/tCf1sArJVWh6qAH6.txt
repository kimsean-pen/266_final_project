Hard times yea I been through 'em
On the block, I'ma get to it
Set up shops, I'm gon move it
Pussy ass nigga I see right through you
Lame ass nigga I see right through you
Catch me down bad, And I might do it
I'm a real solid nigga nothin like you
I'm with my brotha he gon show you what this pipe do

Young ass nigga I been goin through a lot ey
I'ma scrape the pot in this game it's do or die ey
Gotta go and get it saw some niggas gettin got
Only god know my fate but I'm jus tryna see the plot
I know these niggas plot,
12 watchin free my niggas out the cell once I get it then I got em ey
Walkin thru hell wit a Bankroll in my pocket
And my shawty say she ridin, If I'm rollin then she rocking
All designer options, push up in a maserati
Bitch I'm so geeked up, all this purple in my body
Smoke a nigga like a blunt, but I can't hurt nobody
If a nigga tryna rob me then I might just catch a hommie

Hard times yea I been through 'em
On the block, I'ma get to it
Set up shops, I'm gon move it
Pussy ass nigga I see right through you
Lame ass nigga I see right through you
Catch me down bad, And I might do it
I'm a real solid nigga nothin like you
I'm with my brotha he gon show you what this pipe do
