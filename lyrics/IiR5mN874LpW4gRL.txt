My daily meditation
(Breathe in, breathe out)
Help me when I'm escaping
(Breathe in, breathe out)
You're keeping me from fainting
(Breathe in, breathe out)

Go put that money in that
Oh, my brown paper bag
Know your love's gonna last
Even if I was hopeless
My scribbled notes are your tats
On your front and your back
I don't even need a notebook
Oh, rob and steal everything
You conceal
All the ghosts from my past
Get a toast and I laugh
As I choke on this gas
Oh yeah, oh yeah, ay

Bought an eight of the pack
From my plug in, a lac
Then I jam on my MacBook
Had a panic attack
Thought I was gonna yack
But you still got my back though
Oh, you can fold
Take you everywhere that I go
When I'm drunk, talking shit
You don't judge, you don't trip
Even though I'm a misfit
Okay

Thinking back after class
When my lunch would get jacked
Man, that bully was an asshole
He stole my snack, can't react
'Cause he mean and he fat
Now I'm grown, getting cash though, oh
How it feels to be free, to be healed
You're the goat, that's a fact
Hold my smokes and my cash
In my palm, we're attached
Always, always, yeah

(Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out)
My daily meditation
That's why I keep you around

Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
