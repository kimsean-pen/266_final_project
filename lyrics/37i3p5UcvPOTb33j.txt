Hold me close And hold me fast
This magic Spell you cast
This is La Vie En Rose
When you Kiss me Heaven sighs
And though I Close my eyes
I see La Vie En Rose
When you Press me to Your heart
I'm in a world apart
A world where Roses bloom
And when you speak Angels sing from above
Everyday words seem To turn into Love song

Give your Heart and Soul to me
And life will Always be
La Vie En Rose

And when you speak Angels sing from above
Everyday words seem To turn into Love song

Give your Heart and Soul to me
And life will Always be
La Vie En Rose
