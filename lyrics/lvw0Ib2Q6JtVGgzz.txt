Just like a beauty queen
Poppin' loads of Benzedrine
Acting like forever 17
Love your mama's Cadillac
Had it since the dawn of crack
Daddy's little girl ain't coming back

I turn my back
Until you get stacked
I gotta get you going
I gotta get you going
I've made my bed
Now don't you play dead
I gotta get you going
I gotta get you going

I don't wanna waste time
I'll getcha getcha done
You can keep your shoes on
Keep your shoes on
It's not just any night
Let's turn it, turn it long
You can keep your shoes on
Keep your shoes
Keep your shoes
Keep your shoes

Playing Baby Wants a Ride
Freaking your mail order bride
Said she got she pregnant well she lied
Shimmy shimmy coco puff
I can't seem to get enough
Come over here let me touch your stuff

Twist and shout
Boobies hanging all out
You know you got me going
You know you got me going
Better work that blouse
Want your acid house
You know you got me going
You know you got me going

I don't want to play nice
I'll getcha getcha done
You can keep your shoes on
Keep your shoes on
It's not just any night
Let's turn it, turn it long
You can keep your shoes on
Keep your shoes
Keep your shoes
Keep your shoes

Don't stop til the early mornin'
Don't stop til you hear me callin'
You can keep your shoes on

Don't stop til the early mornin'
Don't stop til you hear me callin'
You can keep your shoes on

I don't wanna waste time
I'll getcha getcha done
You can keep your shoes on
Keep your shoes on
It's not just any night
Let's turn it, turn it long
You can keep your shoes on
Keep your shoes

Don't stop til the early mornin'
Don't stop til you hear me callin'
You can keep your shoes on

Don't stop til the early mornin'
Don't stop til you hear me callin'
You can keep your shoes on
