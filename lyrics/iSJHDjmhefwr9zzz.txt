They speak
In the garden of the prophet
Divine madness
The order of the cosmic immoral
For what is humanity
If not forlorn
And crawling in my hands
When the moment sings
For I have read the signs
And I have solved the riddle of eternal life
The Jinnah have spoken
For I have read the signs
And I have solved the riddle of eternal life
