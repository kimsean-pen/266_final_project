Hearts need a beat
like awake needs asleep
like a pen needs a page,
to learn right you need a mistake
Oh, yeah!
Hearts need a mind,
like a clock needs the time
like white needs black,
if you leave I hope you need to come back

Oh, i swear, i know, i believe it, oh
I can't stop hearing all the singin'
Oh my soul has never had this feelin'
it feels like gold

You got so much love in you
You got so much love in you
I'm amazed that i'm talkin' to you
You look like the songs that i've heard my whole life coming true

Strike all the bells, hit 'em hard, make 'em all yell
Celebrate, infatuate, lock us up, yeah, incarcerate oh!

Oh, i swear, i know, i believe it, oh
I can't stop hearing all the singing
Oh my soul has never had this feeling
it feels like so, so,

so much love in you
You got so much love in you
I'm amazed that i'm talkin' to you
You look like the songs that i've heard my whole life coming true

You got so much love in you
You got so much love in you
I'm amazed that i'm talkin' to you
You look like the songs... oh

yeahh, oh come on...

ahhh, ahhhh...

You got so much love in you
You got so much love in you
I'm amazed that i'm talkin' to you
You look like the songs that i've heard my whole life coming true...
you look like the songs, oh oh oh oh!
