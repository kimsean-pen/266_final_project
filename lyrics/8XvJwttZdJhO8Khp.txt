There you go
Getting so overly comfortable, baby
Does it ever cross your mind?
Like oh no, she wants to be in somebody else's photos
On the low-low

You don't know what I'm thinking, you don't even try
Whatever you've been drinking has got you right off your mind like
I know you've been hurting, and I know I'm the reason why

Don't you know, baby?
Only fools stick around when the love is gone
Don't you know, baby?
Only fools stick around when the love is all gone
Don't you know, baby?
Hey, I just fool around
Babe, such a fool for me
(Fool for me)
'Cause only fools stick around
When the love is all gone

You walk a hundred miles
And wait a while for somebody
Who don't even smile
Does it ever cross your mind?
Like oh, oh
She don't want to dance with the same man, no more
Are you so sure?

You don't know what I'm thinking, you don't even try
Whatever you've been drinking has got you right off your mind like
I know you've been hurting, and I know I'm the reason why

Don't you know, baby?
Only fools stick around when the love is gone
Don't you know, baby?
Only fools stick around when the love is all gone
Don't you know, baby?
Hey, I just fool around
Babe, such a fool for me
(Fool for me)
'Cause only fools stick around
When the love is all gone

There you go
Getting so overly comfortable, baby
Does it ever cross your mind?
Like oh no, she wants to be in somebody else's photos
