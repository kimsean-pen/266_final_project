Girl, not too long ago you were mine
Girl, now you've gone and left me behind
Tell me what did I do to deserve this, and made you run away?
Guess there's nothing that I could do to make you look my way

If you go (go)
Then baby there's nothing that I can do
If you should stay (stay)
I'll be loving you forever and a day
If there is something that you should know
Baby girl, I'm not ready to let you go
Ohh, Ohh
I'm not ready to let you go
Ohh, Ohh
I'm not ready to let you go

Oh Girl, my mind is going crazy for you
And Girl, with all the silly things that we do
I'm still missing you (yeah)
Tell me what did I do to deserve this and made you run away?
Guess there's nothing that I could do to make you look my way

If you go (go)
Then baby there's nothing that I can do
(Nothing that I, Nothing that I)
If you should stay (stay)
I'll be loving you forever and a day
If there is something that you should know
(Something that you should know)
Baby girl, I'm not ready to let you go
Ohh, Ohh
I'm not ready to let you go
Ohh, Ohh
I'm not ready to let you go
