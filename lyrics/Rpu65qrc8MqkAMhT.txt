Space is the word
Sign of God...
It's over all that you see
...But it cannot rescue me
Sink in the void
Of how it went down...
You'll know through all that you'll see
...And you'll know your enemy
Space is the word.

Auto Macai
Tie it in bounds
Over all that we know,
Is chaos moving slow...
Drinking the wine
...Howling it down
Corroding all thats still,
My fate and your free will
(Are you ready?)
...well I've made my bed...
(Say are you ready?)
...I've made some preparations...
(Are you ready?)
...but I'm older now ...
(But are you ready?)

Yeah...

Fine.

I'll close tight and go
Like theres nobody listening
I say oh my child,
They're listening.
...They listen.
I'm sewed tight and gone
...Like theres nobody listening
I say Oh My God...
I'm listening...
I LISTEN.

How could Heaven be so frenetic
Oh you've got it, without fanatic hold to body
How your Semitic hold to God it seems so funny...

Now, we become...

The sun.

BURN
BURN
BURN
OH... HEAVENS END
BURN
BURN
BURN
FACE YOUR CHAOS, KNOW WHO YOU ARE!
BURN
BURN
BURN
OH... HEAVENS END

I'll close tight and go
Like theres nobody listening
Ah but oh my child...
They listen.
They listen.
I'm so right I'm told,
And there's nobody listening
I say Oh My God...
I'm listening...
I'm listening.
There's no fun at all...
When theres nobody listening
I say Oh My God...
I've missed this.
I'VE MISSED ME.

How could Heaven be so frenetic
Oh you've got it, without fanatic hold to body
How your Semitic hold to God it seems so funny...

NOW... WE BECOME!
...FINITE!
...INFINITE!

BURN
BURN
BURN
OH... HEAVENS END
BURN
BURN
BURN
TASTE THE CHAOS, KNOW WHO WE ARE!
BURN
BURN
BURN
OH... HEAVENS END
