In the middle of the night
I don't know where we stand
I was looking for a light
You were looking for a tan

I don't want to be patient
And you don't want to be a nurse
I didn't want to get wasted
But goddam cuz you got there first

There's nights like these
Where no man theres nowhere else i rather be
Cuz I'm looking at her
And she's looking at me
And I swear to God I've seen it all before
Like on tv
It's nights like these

Are we going to the park?
Are you bringing more friends?
I don't wanna know the plot
I just wanna know the end

I don't wanna play faith
And you don't wanna play games
I don't wanna go home
But you don't want to know names

It's nights like these
Where no man theres nowhere else i rather be
Cuz I'm looking at her
And she's looking at me
And I swear to God I've seen it all before
Like on tv
It's nights like these
