It's too early for a song
Much too early for a song
Please forgive cause I wrote you one
Allow me to explain
Although it all might change
The words came in and paved themselves
I shouldn't be to blame
Deep inside I sometimes feel
A spinning, uninvited wheel
The pain that's all around
It settles in me
Sadness that I keep
I thought it made me weak
And now I've met your soul it's left me
With the space to sleep

I've been racing all my life
For some unholy prize
And I don't care about it
Making everybody proud
Looking up and running round
And it wears me out

So wake up late
And let's take our time
Drink tequila with too much lime
Because lately I've come to find
That all I want is one incredible waste of time
It's so easy
Warm and light
And I'm feeling
Happy cause I know our song
Will go on and on and on
This waste of time

Your brother taught you how to dance
Then you taught me how to dance
Watch you watch me with the eyes your mother gave you and your hands
Held onto my hands
Standing on your feet
Follow the plodding of the band

I've been racing all my life
For some unholy prize
And I don't care about it
Making everybody proud
Looking up and running round
And it wears me out

So wake up late
And let's take our time
Drink tequila with too much lime
Because lately I've come to find
That all I want is one incredible waste of time
It's so easy
Warm and light
And I'm feeling
Happy cause I know our song
Will go on and on and on
This waste of time
Waste of time
Waste of time
On and on and on this wasted time

When the world is far too bright and you need to close your eyes
To the craziness, the maze that grows
And twists along outside
Just find a way to play
This simple song I made for you to make it go away

So wake up late
And let's take our time
Drink tequila with too much lime
Because lately I've come to find
That all I want is one incredible waste of time
It's so easy
Warm and light
And I'm feeling
Happy cause I know our song
Will go on and on and on
This waste of time
