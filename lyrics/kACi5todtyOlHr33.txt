Johnny joined the army
The cause he didn't know
He served three years
In the Middle East
You know it doesn't show

Push push push push push push push push

Johnny was a soldier
He can't dance anymore

Push push push push push push push push

Johnny was a soldier
He can't dance anymore

When he came out
He tried to form a band
But he's only got one leg
And he can hardly stand

Push push push push push push push push

Johnny was a soldier
He can't dance anymore

Push push push push push push push push

Johnny was a soldier
He can't dance anymore...

Now he drinks alone
He gets sentimental
He watches girls dance
And he's thrown away his medals
