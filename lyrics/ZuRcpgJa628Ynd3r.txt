Now we're getting older
Life is turning out
Colder every winter
She doesn't mind

Many years together
Kids are on their way
I'm feeling [?]
As long as she will stay

That's what I'm afraid of
Remain here when she goes
Pass away would feel much easier
Than to stay on my own
She says we'll be together
After all
Maybe she will fly while
I fall
