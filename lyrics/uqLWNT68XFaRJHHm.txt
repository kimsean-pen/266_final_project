Hooray for me!
Call me stupid, call me crazy, call me what you will
I don't write this music with intent to pay my bills
Cookie cut-out cardboard bands and we all sound the same
Guess I'm just a hypocrite for living out my dreams
May not make a difference, not trying to make you see
May not make much sense to you, but oh it does to me
When it's all been said and done, I know that I had fun

I'll take it to the grave with me
This music still lives
What can I say that I haven't said before?

Not afraid to be mistaken, not afraid to try
Not afraid to be uncertain, not afraid to die
When the words stop coming out, the music finally stops
Pound my head against the wall, my bubble has been popped
Lost the vibe, the fluid feel, the ink's gone from my pen
Picked apart, there's nothing left will it come back again?
When it's all been said and done, I know that I had fun

I'll take it to the grave with me
This music still lives...

It's the tale of a broken man
I just can't find the words, my story goes unheard
The tale of a broken man
Just can't find the words, my story goes unheard
The tale of a broken man, broken man
Broken!
