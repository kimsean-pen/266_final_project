The drought was the very worst
(Ahh, ahh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth
(Ahh, ahh)
You're still all over me like a wine stained dress
I can't wear anymore
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do
(Ahh, ahh)
When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof
(Ahh, ahh)
I let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
The water filled my lungs
I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

I think I am finally clean
(Ahhhh)
Said, I think I am finally clean
(Ahhhh)

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean
Don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean
I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst
(Ahh, ahh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
(Ahh, ahh)
Think I'm finally clean
