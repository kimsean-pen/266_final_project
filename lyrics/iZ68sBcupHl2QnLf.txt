Your mouth said this never
But your fingers have shown me
That your head is so clever
You claim that you own me
Forever

You have the right to conduct me
In whatever fashion
Your attempt construct me
In the interest of passion
You sent me
To toledo

I came back with handfulls
I did what you asked me
But after the thank yous
That you quickly got passed me
I'm expected
You're expecting
I'm expected
Expected
