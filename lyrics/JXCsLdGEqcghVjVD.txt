You're mean to me
Why must you be mean to me?
Gee, honey, it seems to me
You love to see me cryin'
I don't know why
I stay home each night
When you say you'll phone
You don't, then I'm left alone.

Singin' the blues and cryin'
You treat me coldly each day in the year
You always scold me
Whenever somebody is near, dear
I must be great fun to be mean to me
You shouldn't, for can't you see
What you mean to me

You're mean to me
Why must you be mean to me?
Gee, honey, it seems to me
You love to see... me cryin'
I stay home each night
When you say you'll phone
You don't then I'm left alone

Singin' the blues and cryin'
You treat me coldly, each day in the year
You always scold me
Whenever somebody is near, dear
It must be great fun to be mean to me
Gee, honey, what can't you see
What you mean to me
Can't you see what you mean to me
