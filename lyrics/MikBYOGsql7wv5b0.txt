How long will all your words have to hurt me
Could you please tell me
This time intention was good enough trust me
You tried to save me
I know your hell is enough to burn me
Won't you just leave me
In time knowing me will cloak your daydreams
And you will hate me

In every word you say the meaning of forgiveness sounded maybe, maybe
Those hateful words you tried to feed me even though you tried to fix me
Sounded like a lie among the stars
Reflecting purple light of broken hearts

In every word you say the meaning of forgiveness sounded maybe, maybe
Those hateful words you tried to feed me even though you tried to fix me
Sounded like a lie among the stars
Reflecting purple light of these broken hearts

Ask me how many time you did leave me
You wanted to end it
You tried so many times to forget me
You didn't need me
This time your perfect world is collapsing
And you will hate me
What if intension is good enough maybe
You will forget me

In every word you say the meaning of forgiveness sounded maybe, maybe
Those hateful words you tried to feed me even though you tried to fix me
Sounded like a lie among the stars
Reflecting purple light of broken hearts

In every word you say the meaning of forgiveness sounded maybe, maybe
Those hateful words you tried to feed me even though you tried to fix me
Sounded like a lie among the stars
Reflecting purple light of broken hearts
