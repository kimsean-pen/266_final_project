... I'm sailing away to undiscovered seas ...

I see a golden light shining far away
I can't tell if I'll make it there someday
I reach my hands but there's no one on my path
I can't sleep 'cause my body is burning
Cold sweat, cannot breathe, I'm losing my mind
Reflection in the mirror shows a different man at night
And as hours and seconds pass by
I feel my every feeling wither and die
Do I really feel this pain
'cause sometimes I can't tell if I'm awake

Watching to the night, the hope is gone
Carrying so much burden in my heart
Watching to the night with tired eyes
Waiting for nothing all my life

Battle against time
I... battle against time

I am covered with cold ice, I am flying in the black skies
Fighting everyday, but it feels like, it's just the same
Oh time... you cut my heart and soul
you carve my will and passion of life
'cause the days of emptiness are piercing through me like arrows

I feel nothing, but hate and love
So much fire inside, so much left undone

.Solo.

... I'm sailing away and nothing will ever be the same ...
