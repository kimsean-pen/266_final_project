I'll walk into the water,
To wash the blood from my feet.
My path is ever holding,
My shadows claimed release.

The sky it holds my father,
The sun recalls my soul.
The reason forgotten,
Of the lessons burned in oak,

My always wanting watchers,
They laugh and slash at my mind.
The deafening redeemer,
Lays me down and feeds me time,

Death was my first companion,
It showed me life and it snuffed it out.
The vision never ending.
Of the ghosts through and out.

All rage in gold the flower...
Pull me in to see,
The battles break me but I am given,
To the lost lord,
Within the circle of clarion's eye.
