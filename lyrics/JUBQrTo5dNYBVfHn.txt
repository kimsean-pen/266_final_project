Can't tell you what's coming next, I don't know for sure
It could be good, and it could be bad, I don't know for sure
I guess that I'll continue on from day to day
The only way to answer that, to answer that would be to be that way

I wanted this, and I wanted that, I don't know for sure
And don't ask because I don't know, I don't know for sure
I never get confused 'cause I don't really know
So I'm happy and so what, so what means that I don't know

It's too simple to explain, I don't know for sure
And words are never proper words, I don't know for sure
What is simple, what is hard is harder to discern
These feelings that are feeling like the feelings that we learn

I can't tell you what's coming next, I don't know for sure
It could be good, and it could be bad, I don't know for sure
I never get confused 'cause I don't really know
So I'm happy and so what, so what means that I don't know

I can't tell you what's coming next 'cause I don't know for sure
I can't tell you what's coming next 'cause I don't know for sure
