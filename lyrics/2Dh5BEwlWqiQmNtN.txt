Maybe you're too innocent
And I'm a crack in your glass
Watch me run down
Under your fingers
Maybe I'm indifferent, shut down
Oh, you know me all too well

'Cause no, I'm not an anthem
Not much hope
No, I'm not an idea you decided was gold

'Cause I know I'm a sinner
But I could be a saint in your head
No I don't got religion
But I'll tip my hat to the dead
No, I'm not a season
Set to leave me in the cold
Still, I got a sickness
That time you said I was, said I was yours

Baby, I'm magnificently shut down
Take me to the water, watch me drown
Watch me drown
Cause I know I'm not innocent
But if you let me, I could show you how it feels
To be buried underground

'Cause I know I'm a sinner
But I could be a saint in your head
No I don't got religion
But I'll tip my hat to the dead
No, I'm not a season
Set to leave me in the cold
Still, I got a sickness
That time you said I was, said I was yours

'Cause no, I'm not an anthem
Not much hope
Not an idea you decided was gold
No, I'm not a season
Set to leave me in the cold
Still, I got a sickness
That time you said I was yours

'Cause I know I'm a sinner
But I could be a saint in your head
No I don't got religion
But I'll tip my hat to the dead
No, I'm not a season
Set to leave me in the cold
Still, I got a sickness
That time you said I was, said I was yours
