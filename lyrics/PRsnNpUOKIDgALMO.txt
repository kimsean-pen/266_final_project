Looking back, not ever looking in
My mistakes are for others to understand
If I made them it was on purpose
A less for you
What you desereve

Was it worth it?
The pointless struggle
Against yourself

Who are you?
Who am I even talking to?
Find yourself at the bottom of a bottle
At the end of a line
On the edge of a blade

The is revenge unto myself
You cannot be faltered

They are wrong
They are weak

And you are stray

It takes courage to destroy yourself
Mindfulness as a tool
Of annihilation
