Open up your eyes
I've got nothing to say
There's no one else but us
In this little place

Moving like the rain
Liquid like a flame
Carried by a storm

And there's no one else
Yes, there's no one else
To take care of my soul

When the fever comes
When the fever comes
When the fever comes
When the fever comes
When the fever comes
When the fever comes
When the fever comes
To take care of my soul
To take care of my soul
To take care of my soul
To take care of my soul

At ninety nine degrees
The mind is clearly boiling
But you can feel the breath
Of the crowded dancing

Crazy and insane
Forgetting the pain
Treated by the love

And there's no one else
Yes, there's no one else
To take care of my soul

When the fever comes
When the fever comes
When the fever comes
When the fever comes
When the fever comes
When the fever comes
When the fever comes
To take care of my soul
To take care of my soul
To take care of my soul
I take care of my soul

To take care of my soul
