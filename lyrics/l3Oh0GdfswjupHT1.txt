You take a right now
You take it left
Somebody believe in my words,
You aim away

I turned you up then
Yu shook me down
Can anybody hear in my words
What I scream away?

I dream you bow down,
Then fade away
somebody believe in my words
You aim away.

I feel you lost now,
Or just stoned away
Can anybody hear in my words
What I scream away?

Days go by,
Gotta, gotta get'em all over
Over

You took it right now
You took it left
I'll start a spark inside the path
Hold on your breath

compress me in sound
Tax me the fine
Why do you always speak in signs?
Clear my sight

I dream you bow down
Then fade away
Somebody believe in my words
You aim away

Just like a puzzle
I figure out
The misconception of my words
Small talk and loud
