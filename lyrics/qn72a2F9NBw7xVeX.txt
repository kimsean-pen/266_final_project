Don't it feel like every evening
Something new to cloud your mind
Keeps you staring at the ceiling
Keeps your heart from feeling right

Keep your head up, you're doing fine
I know it's hard, but you'll be alright
Don't think twice when it all goes wrong
But in time you'll come out on top

Well it feels like every morning
When you're trying to start the day
Something comes to bum you out
Keeps your mind from thinking straight

Keep your head up, you're doing fine
I know it's hard, but you'll be alright
Don't think twice when it all goes wrong
But in time you'll come out on top

Well I think I'll take it easy
Take it one day at a time
And I wait for you to find me
In my foolish paradise

Keep your head up, you're doing fine
I know it's hard, but you'll be alright
Don't think twice when it all goes wrong
But in time you'll come out on top
