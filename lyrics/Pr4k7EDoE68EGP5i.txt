I know a guy with a rock star life
but he still don't fly so he's mad at the sky
he sits me down he kicks his wisdom
he's been around now give him a listen
seems like he's got a lot of complaints
about how nowadays things ain't the same, nah
used to play some faith in the basement
a toast for this guy
and those kids that he came with
'cause they all on the same shit
based on cut down placement
uptown stay strong
don't ever do a dance with the devil now
that smile is a sign that you're sellin' out
judgement gossip ethics
let's just exploit all this excess
then you can feel how he feels
to walk around town
lookin' down from them tall heels
and who needs fame or fortune
when you get the same love
that the famous snortin'?
future so afraid of yours
that you strayed from the course
and you came up short
believe he would have more credibility
if he wasn't just another drunk pill junky
it's obvious to me that he's still hungry
for the superstars a little bad lucky
go ahead and get mad at god
point your fingers at your dad
and at santa claus
listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
wouldn't look so bad with the bandage off
it goes

One for the bar tab two for the shine
let's go to your car do another line
barely trust 'em they're all puppets
love is nothin' scared of success
One for the bass two for the drums
last call gonna take whatever comes
barely trust 'em they're all puppets

love is nothin' scared of success

I think its great how you used to be great
I can't hate on how you choose to relate
but I know that you had the potential
I understand why you wanted to let go
a lot of pressure
in the middle of those shoulders
and we ain't getting nothin' but older
ain't nothin' changed
but the day we run from

but nobody knows that
better than you, huh?

One for the bar tab two for the shine
let's go to your car do another line
barely trust 'em they're all puppets
love is nothin' scared of success
One for the bass two for the drums
last call gonna take whatever comes
barely trust 'em they're all puppets
love is nothin' scared of success
One for the bar tab two for the shine
let's go to your car do another line
barely trust 'em they're all puppets
love is nothin' scared of success
One for the bass two for the drums
last call gonna take whatever comes
barely trust 'em they're all puppets
love is nothin' scared of success
Barely trust 'em they're all puppets
love is nothin' scared of success
