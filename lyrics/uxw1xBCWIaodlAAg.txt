Time to run
Time to hide
Holy war in the land of fire

Never tempt the
Wrath of gods
Gonna dance in the death of life

Take the hand
Enter the world
Just remember you will surely die

Never sell
Evil for lies
Gonna give you the kiss of life

Serpents of the lord
Crawling
To the will of god
Serpents of your lord
Crawling
All evil

Serpent jesus
Snake of christ
Nailed to a cross
Of a holy design

Blood to water
Water to wine
Whip the soul 'til a mother cries

Bring it down
Pierce the side
Start the legend w/a funeral rite

Serpent jesus
Snake of christ
Gonna build you
A world of lies
Serpents of the lord

Crawling
To the will of god
Serpents of your lord
Crawling
All evil
Oh yea
Oh yea
Oh yea

Crawling
Serpent Jesus
Snake of Christ
Nailed to a cross
Of a holy design
Blood to water
Water to wine
Whip the soul 'til a mother cries

Bring it down, baby
Pierce the side
Start the legend with a funeral rite

Serpent Jesus
Snake of Christ
Gonna build you
World of lie
