Is it strange for me to say that
If I were to die today
There's not a thing I would change
I've lived well
Maybe I have made mistakes and been through my fair share of pain
But all in all, it's been okay, I've lived well
And the more that I see, the more that I know
I don't know anything, at all
Like the more that I breath, and start to go slow
Oh, one of many things, I can only recall
All of the good things, good things
All of the good things, good things
Only the good, the good, the good
Only the good, the good, the good
Living on Sycamore street, and spending weekends on the beach
We were free, to be everything we dreamed
Flying kites and water fights
Summer nights, we'd ride our bikes
On over hill, and dare our heights
Man I swear
Like the more that I breath, and start to go slow
Oh, one of many things, I can only recall
All of the good things, good things
All of the good things, good things
Only the good, the good, the good
Only the good, the good, the good
All of the good things, good things
All of the good things, good things
Only the good, the good, the good
Only the good, the good, the good
All of the good things, good things
All of the good things, good things
Only the good, the good, the good
Only the good, the good, the good
