Yellow sun is shining in the afternoon,
I'd really like to tell you but I feel it's too soon.
My actions are dictated by the phase of the moon,
The phase of the moon.

The sun, it isn't hiding when it sets on you,
It's not a coward like me and I know that it's true.
Waiting for the darkness now is all I can do,
It's all I can do.

And if the sun should follow us into your room,
Then the courage will be wrought from me to tell you the truth.
The setting sun's the only thing that's shining on you,
That's shining on you.

You're makin' me hungry, but what's really funny is it's not sunny anymore.

And when I finally told you when the sun has gone,
You're laughing 'cause you thought I was the only one.
And the only thing that's left for me is the rising sun,
The rising sun.

You're makin' me hungry.
You're makin' me hungry, but what's really funny is it's not sunny anymore.
You're makin' me hungry.
You're makin' me hungry, but what's really funny is it's not sunny anymore.
It's not sunny anymore...
