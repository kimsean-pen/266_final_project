I'm going down, going down, deeper than inside

--the world is my fuse--

And once inside gonna tear till there's nothing left to find
And you wonder just how close close-up can be?
Can't you see? Can't you see?
I had a dream all my thoughts turned to real lips

--and the world is my fuse--

And just a dream, just a dream can bring me to my knees
And you wonder just how tight skin deep can be?
Can't you see? Can't you see?
I'm goin down, going down, deeper than inside

--the world is my fuse--

And from inside, outside can just fall apart
And you wonder just how lost inside can be?

Try me. Try me.
