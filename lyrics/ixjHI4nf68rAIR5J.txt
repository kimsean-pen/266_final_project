When I look into your eyes
I see the world spinning
Whisper me forward and master my fear
Carry me gently into your cure

(Forevermore)

With hands held shallow
Reflect upon tomorrow
Remembering the rain
We can live again

As we follow the hollow hills
Into the pit of our dreams
Can we relive the past
Or just frop to our knees

Reflect upon tomorrow
Remembering the rain
We can live again

Take my price and pull away

I'm just a slave
Just a victim
Of multiple addictions
