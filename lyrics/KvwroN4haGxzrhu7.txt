Five seconds in your heart
Straight to your heart
I can't get to your heart
She said, five seconds in your heart
Straight to your heart
I can't get to your heart

Linking arms to the right time
Drop your head to please mine
Give her a sign

I don't believe in you
You don't believe in me
So how could you make me cry?

Five seconds in your heart
Straight to your heart
I can't get to your heart
There's no way to forget it all
Five seconds to your heart
Straight to your heart
I can't get to your heart

Five seconds in your heart
Straight to your heart
I can't get to your heart
She said, five seconds in your heart
Straight to the heart
I can't to your heart

Romantic night
But you're faint
You keep losing on
On a string
How could you feel?

When it comes it sounds like
And when it comes we kiss
And when it comes it sounds like
And when it comes we kiss

Five seconds in your heart
Straight to the heart
I can't get to your heart
She said, five seconds in your heart
Straight to the heart
I can't get to your heart

There's no way to forget it all
Five seconds in your heart
Straight to the heart
I can't get to your heart
I'm not trying to make you cry

I don't believe in
You don't believe in me
So how could you make me cry?

There's no way to forget it all
I don't know why
But I'm not trying to make you cry

Five seconds in your heart
Straight to the heart
I can't get to your heart

Five seconds in your heart
Straight to the heart
I can't get to your heart

There's no way to forget it all
I don't know why
But I'm not trying to make you cry

Five seconds in your heart
Straight to your heart
I can't get to your heart
