We walked through the city at night
And I whispered in your ear
That I need you here with me
You know that street we just past?
I think that's where I saw you last

And I'm 365 days away
You're not with me anymore
Yeah, we lost touch long, long ago
And I'm 365 days away
You're not with me anymore
Yeah, we lost touch long, long ago

I was too tired to argue with you
I was too tired, so I let it go
I was too tired to argue with you
I was too tired, so I let it go
I was too tired to argue with you
I was too tired, so I let it go
I was too tired to argue with you
So I let it go, yeah, I let it go

And I'm 365 days away
You're not with me anymore
Yeah, we lost touch long, long ago
And I'm 365 days away
You're not with me anymore
Yeah, we lost touch long, long ago
