The plan it wasn't much of a plan
I just started walking
I had enough of this old town
And nothing else to do
It was one of those nights, you wonder how nobody died
We started talking
You didn't come here to have fun, you said: well I just came for you
Do you still love me
Do you feel the same
Do I have a chance of doing that old dance
With someone I've been pushing away
And touch we touched the soul
The very soul, the soul of what we were then
With the old schemes of shattered dreams lying on the floor
You looked at me
No more than sympathy, my lies you have heard them
My stories you have laughed with
My clothes you have torn
And do you still love me
Do you feel the same
And do I have a chance of doing that old dance again
Is it too late for some of that romance again
Let's go away, we'll never have the chance again
You lost that feeling
You want it again
More than I'm feeling
You'll never get
You had a go at
All that you know
You lost that feeling
So come down and show

Don't say goodbye
Let accusations fly like in that movie
You know the one where Martin Sheen
Waves his arm to the girl on the street
I once told a friend that nothing really ends
No-one can prove it
So I'm asking you now
Could it possibly be
That you still love me
And do you feel the same
Do I have a chance of doing that old dance again
Or is it too late for some of that romance again
Let's go away, we'll never have the chance again
I take it all from you
I take it all from you
I take it all from you
I take it all from you
I take it all from you
I take it all from you
