Wow, wow, wow
Wow, wow, wow
Wow, wow, wow

Never been a brainiac
In my yellow and red, I'm a Hulkamaniac
If you think you can see us on the mic
Uh, I suggest you adjust your sight
Going Hollywood, I look good in black and white
Give me a bottle, I bet you I power through
And they screaming, "Go Hill," like they rooting for the college team in powder blue
Faded off weed, liquor, and powder too
This is food for thought, better take the whole plate

Don't lie, some of y'all thought food for thought meant taking these hoes on a date
Fuck what you think, we're great
Dropped, washed up and we pissed off an entire state

Wow, now you're overreacting
I guess sometimes it just goes like that, man

All of the kids like wow, wow, wow
The old niggas like wow, wow, wow
The college girls like wow, wow, wow
I got the city like wow, wow, wow
All of the kids like wow, wow, wow
The old niggas like wow, wow, wow
The college girls like wow, wow, wow
We got the city like wow, wow, wow

Check it, I feel like Keyshawn in '07
Shit, I was robbin' niggas when I was eleven
Cause it's not what you got, but how you rock it
I was killing them with South Pole up on my pockets
But now killing it is a dedication
So the game's losing niggas due to their parent emancipation
Proclamation, one nation full of nigga's hate and
Low patience, but I have a demand for money statements
And I'm just repenting
I've been rolling through the city with my windows all tinted
And how you niggas going jock on a legend?
Like, how you niggas going to run when we're slipping?
But when we winning, you like, "We were here since the beginning."
I look at niggas like, "Wow, wow, wow."
We run the city now, now, now

All of the kids like wow, wow, wow
The old niggas like wow, wow, wow
The college girls like wow, wow, wow
I got the city like wow, wow, wow
All of the kids like wow, wow, wow
The old niggas like wow, wow, wow
The college girls like wow, wow, wow

We got the city like wow, wow, wow
I go to Shanko with twenty five thou
You going twenty five hundred, wow
I got zero plaques on my wall right now
You got forty retweets, damn, nigga, wow
I go to Shanko with twenty five thou
You going twenty five hundred, wow
I got zero plaques on my wall right now
You got forty retweets, damn, nigga, wow
I go to Shanko with twenty five thou
You going twenty five hundred, wow
I got zero plaques on my wall right now
You got forty retweets, damn, nigga, wow
