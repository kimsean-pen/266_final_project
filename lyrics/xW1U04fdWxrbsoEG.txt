The needle on my record player has been wearing thin
This record has been playing since the day you've been with him

No more long rides home
No more of your station
I didn't like it anyway

Remember the time we wrote our names up on the wall?
Remember the time we realized 'Thriller' was our favorite song?

Have I waited too long?
Have I found that someone?
Have I waited too long to see you?

Have I waited too long?
Have I found that someone?
Have I waited too long to see you?

Maybe it's for the best
Maybe it's not for anything
It wouldn't be so bad to take this right from me

No more long rides home
No more of your station
I didn't like it anyway

Remember the time we wrote our names up on the wall?
Remember the time we realized 'Thriller' was our favourite song?

Have I waited too long?
Have I found that someone?
Have I waited too long to see you?

Have I waited too long?
Have I found that someone?
Have I waited too long to see you?

How many times I've tried
It's simple to you, so simple to lie
How many times I've tried
Blatant mistakes of your design

How many times I've tried
It's simple to you, so simple to lie
Blatant mistakes of your design

Have I waited too long
Have I found that someone
Have I wanted too long to see you?

I've had so many chances
Turn my back and I ran away
I've had so many chances
to see you
