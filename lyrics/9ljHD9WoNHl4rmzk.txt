I was wading in the mire, deep in the mud
It was sticking to my soles, drowning my love
Breathing in words of wisdom from fairweather friends
I was dreaming of a better way

I found myself like a fire finds folly in a flood
Suffocating just to sit where others stood
I found your eyes, they were drifting out towards mine
You were looking for a better way

Kristina, my believer
You pinned me down, and I carved out your name
Kristina, my believer
I found your love like a river finds its way

Sleepless nights we rumbled, tumbled in the dark
Finally lost within knowing how honest love can start
I touched your body, I made it all my own
And you held me in those unfamiliar ways

Kristina, my believer
You pinned me down, and I carved out your name
Kristina, my believer
I found your love like a river finds its way

Kristina, my believer
You pinned me down, and I carved out your name
Kristina, my believer
I found your love like a river finds its way
