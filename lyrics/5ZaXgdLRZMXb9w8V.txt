Somewhere between my unforgotten dream
And a feeling based on my new best enemy
Something has been hiding far beyond the evergreen
And it's bittersweet

Wake up to find myself back in this state
In a place I always knew wouldn't relate
Destination certainly unforgiving
Waiting in the wings

You'll see natural pleasures
I've arrived
Common sense should tell me that the ones I sin against
Say goodbye

Taking drastic measures
For the ride
Promising my family and the friends I never see
That I'm alive
Alive

You'll see natural pleasures
I've arrived
Common sense should tell me that the ones I sin against
Say goodbye

Taking drastic measures
For the ride
Promising my family and the friends I never see
That I'm alive
I'm alive

Taking drastic measures
Taking drastic measures
