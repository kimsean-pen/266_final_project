Follow my heart out in the blue oh-oh
If you get lost ah-oh, ah-oh
Follow my heart out in the blue oh-oh
If you get lost, I will find you
It can't be right
that it's an endless flight
It can't be true 'cause I'm in love with you
If you get lost, can't find your way back
Open your heart and I will find you
Follow my heart out in the blue oh-oh
If you get lost ah-oh, ah-oh
Follow my heart out in the blue oh-oh
If you get lost, I will find you
Not what it seems, all we do is dream
Saw you coming in the haze
You're my favorite place
Follow my heart out in the blue oh-oh
If you get lost ah-oh, ah-oh
Follow my heart out in the blue oh-oh
If you get lost, I will find you
If you get lost, can't find your way back
Open your heart and I will find you
