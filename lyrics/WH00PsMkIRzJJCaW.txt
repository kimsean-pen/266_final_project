Curse you all men
Who's coil is strong
I recognise the sparrows heart
Beneath the theatre of misery
Disbelivers shalt by dawn
Be forced
To forever mourn

Curse you all men
That resent my empire
Cause I have risen again
At war this time
The truth I speak
Is your decease
My word is your defeat

And thou shalt not
Be able to hide anymore
The prophecy will
Conquer at last
Your sense of reality
With mission to kill
The theatre of misery

He has risen again
Armed with the source of sin
And as humans shalt fade
He shalt inherit their strength
Men of the damned;
Your will reluctantly
Secure His eternal victory

Yes, you are indeed the few;
I am the one.
