There's a bottomless pit that we've been climbing from
Just to get on level ground
Shake your seasick legs around
Everyone in a logo town
Signs of life are stark and flickering

I need a bed to lay my body down
Dead weight to carry me down
Some static is lulling me to sleep

Hang your clothes on a chain link fence
In a junkyard say amen
Your mouth is full of wordless hymns
And run-on sentences

And we're helpless and forgetting in the background holding nothing
And we're youthless and pretending in the bearhands holding nothing

There's a million horse dragging down a monolith
these trademarks so bereaved
Tied my leg to a barricade
with a plastic handgrenade
They tried to turn emotion into noise

I need a teleprompter for my life
Need a pipeline to the night
My body can't get no relief

And this life it goes by fast
To treading water in the past
While you try to reanimate something that you don't understand

And we're helpless and forgetting in the background don't saying nothing
And he's youthless and forgetting in the bare hymns tied to nothing

And he's helpless and forgetting in the background don't saying nothing
And he's youthless and pretending with his bare hands tied to nothing
