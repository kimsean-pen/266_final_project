Brainfreeze!
Pull the splinter out slowly
I'll peel the scab off your knee
Let the lake wash it clean
My lies
Settle thicker than my milkshake
But they both make my stomach ache
And they're both slowly weighing me down
Weighing me down
I hear you climbing on the roof
About to break your knee
Calling me to come on up
Cause I can't sleep
And you could never get a ride home
So you'd end up on the front porch
All of us and our unpaid dues
We know we're in for
In the backyard
I hold my breath deep
I drip-dry your nose bleed
Don't want to wake you from your deadly sleep
Inside
You capture memories
Of a four-legged beauty queen
She's the best thing you've ever seen
I hear you climbing on the roof
About to break your knee
Calling me to come on up
Cause I can't sleep
And you could never get a ride home
So you'd end up on the front porch
All of us and our unpaid dues
We know we're in for
I know you're in your room
But I can't look at you
I know you're in your room
But I can't look at you
I can't look at you
I can't look at you
