When my last sign of humanity will be heaved
When all my enemies will be dead or agonizing
When I'm finally alone with no one to speak to
When I won't want to fight in this world anymore

I'll pass away without regret, without fear in this endless cosmos
I'll miss nothing, none will weep on my grave

As I'll have lived everything from deception to deception,
When every glimmer of hope will have faded into the opaque black
Into the opaque black...

I'll leave without sorrow, without hate, without fright in front of the mouth of death
Without letting nothing behind, in the infinite space among the stars

Lying in my own blood, falling asleep in the night, leaving without regret,
I prayed for that all my life long
Colder again under the beautiful sad dead moon, I'm joining her...
So tired and old I die letting behind me a contemptible mortal world
My destroyed dreams will then reveal mightier again, I hear the hearse coming for me
The result of my existence when I carried only despair
