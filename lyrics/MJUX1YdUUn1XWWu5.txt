Though you may not drive
A great big Cadillac
Gangster whitewalls
TV antennas in the back

You may not have, a car at all
But just remember, brothers and sisters
You can still stand tall
Just be thankful, for what you've got

Though you may not drive
A great big Cadillac
Diamonds in the back, sunroof top, diggin' the scene with the gasoline
Gangster whitewalls
TV antennas in the back

You may not have, a car at all
But just remember, brothers and sisters
You can still stand tall
Just be thankful (Diamonds in the back,
sunroof top, diggin' the scene with the gasoline)
For what you've got (Oo-oo-oo)

Though you may not drive
A great big Cadillac
Gangster whitewalls
TV antennas in the back

You may not have, a car at all
But just remember, brothers and sisters
You can still stand tall
Just be thankful, for what you've got

(Diamonds in the back, sunroof top,
diggin' the scene with the gasoline, oo-oo-oo)
Diamonds in the back
(Diamonds in the back, sunroof top,
diggin' the scene with the gasoline, oo-oo-oo)

(Diamonds in the back, sunroof top,
diggin' the scene with the gasoline, oo-oo-oo)
That's why I'm on top, yeah
(Diamonds in the back, sunroof top,
diggin' the scene with the gasoline, oo-oo-oo) Yeah-ah
