Ooo-oo-oo
Ooo-oo-oo
Oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

I get some headaches when I hit the heights
Like in the morning after crazy nights
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Like some mother in law in her nylon tights

They're always, they're always
They're always, they're always
Coming soon
Coming soon
On the outside
Of the tracks
You take 'em

The same old babies with the same old toys
The neighbours screaming when the noise annoys
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Somebody nagging you when you're out with the boys

They're always, they're always
They're always, they're always
Coming soon
Coming soon
On the outside
Of the track

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Watch me now

They're always, they're always
They're always, they're always
Coming soon
Coming soon
On the outside
Of the track

Coming soon
Coming soon
On the outside
Of the track

Yeah, yeah, yeah
