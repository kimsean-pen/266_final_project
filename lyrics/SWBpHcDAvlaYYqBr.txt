Got with the program,
Swallowed it whole,
Sugar made it easy,
Ice made it cold.

Reached out and touched them
On a tv screen,
Broke out the polish,
Scrubbed it clean,
That dirty machine.

This is your portion,
Please don't share,
The only answer,
Your only prayer,
Your reflection,
Please don't stare,
Nothing is going on in...
There is your manner,
What you wear,
Your diseases and your repairs,
All your belongings,
Please don't share,
Nothing is going on in there.

Update the cleanser,
Never mind the stain,
We'll take the package,
Let the contents remain,
Contents remain as yet unnamed.

This is your portion,
Please don't share,
The only answer,
Your only prayer,
Your reflection,
Please don't stare,
Nothing is going on in...
There is your manner,
What you wear,
Your diseases and your repairs,
All your belongings,
Please don't share,
Nothing is going on in there.

Came home flat busted
Only to be saved;
Everything comes down to you
In a world concave, world concave,
So well behaved,
We still turn on,
Thirty minutes long,
We still turn on
