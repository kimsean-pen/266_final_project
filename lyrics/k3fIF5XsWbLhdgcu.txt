Why won't (Time)
Slow down (Why won't)
Why won't (Time)
Slow... down
We all go down
(Down, down)
We all will drown
(Drown, drown)

Fucked up and let down
No one to save me now
So alone, so alone
Face down on the ground
Looked up, saw no light (No light)
Everybody lied

Break, fuck, kill
You will never, never, never be saved
Break, fuck, kill
You will never, never, never be saved

Keeping a gun loaded under my bed 'cause I know that one day I'll be swallowing lead
When enough is enough and I'm ready to be all up in the Ethereal Plane
AAAHHH!
Break everything you want, fuck anything that won't
Kill the ones that make the laws

Break, fuck, kill
You will never, never, never be saved
Break, fuck, kill
You will never, never, never be saved
