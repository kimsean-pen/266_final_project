What's left when the morning comes
Is the memory of a future
When my blood is done
There is nothing left to hold onto

There were friends waiting at my door
They have gone now, for the air is new
Stalked by my word, when the rains came
Made it true and pure to dissolve the hurt

Loneliness and destruction
Pursuing a dream we once had
Is it our intention to follow this road till the end
Even if the end is a word, sorrow

There is a bond between us
Even if it's frayed, it's unbreakable
So I come for you
And I welcome pain for a second, belonging somewhere

There were times when I lost my way
With hope hope pouring from my soul
Shelter from silence
Don't want to bear my scars for you
