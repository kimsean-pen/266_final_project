Fight the darkness sing the song

Move it Move it Move it Move it

If one smile could erase a frown
Imagine what two could do
Turn it up

And if one voice could change a heart
Imagine what two could do
Turn it up hey

The time is now
No time to wait
Turn up the love
Turn down the hate
Turn up the love
Turn down the hate
Keep dancing too let the record play
The time is now
No need to wait
Turn up the love say cause Im free
No time to wait
Make the world move

Come on and make the world move

Spinning faster
Round and round
Let me hear that future sound

Imagine what a few could do turn it up

Dont listen to the point of view
And haters aint fooling you turn it up

The time is now
No time to wait
Turn up the love
Turn down the hate
Turn up the love
Turn down the hate
Keep dancing too let the record play
The time is now
No need to wait
Turn up the love say cause Im free
No time to wait
Make the world move

Come on and make the world move

Spinning faster
Round and round
Let me hear that future sound

Starts with me and you

Make the world move
Just think about it
Anybody

Oh Oh Oh
Cause if anybody
Can love somebody
So can everybody
Oh Oh Oh
Imma need somebody
To help somebody
Do ya need somebody
The time is now
No time to wait
Turn up the love
Turn down the hate
Turn up the love

Make the world move

Come on and make the world move

Spinning faster round and round
Let me hear that future sound

Starts with me and you

Make the world move
