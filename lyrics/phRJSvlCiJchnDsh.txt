Angel, don't take those sleeping pills, you don't need them
Though it's just time they kill
Angel, give me your sleeping pills, you don't need them
Give me the time they kill

You're a water sign, I'm an air sign
Gone gone to Valium, can you get me some?
You're a water sign, and I'm an air sign
Too Siamese to catch the leaves from those trees

Angel, don't take those sleeping pills, you don't need them
though it's just time they kill

you're a water sign, I"m an air sign
Pumped up with Valium, could you get me some?
You're a water sign, I'm an air sign
With sweet F.A. to do today, with sweet F.A. to do today...

...Angel, don't take those sleeping pills
