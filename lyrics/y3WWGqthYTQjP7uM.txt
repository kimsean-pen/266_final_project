I ' ve got our love to remember
That will never change
I have you in my head
And no I' ll never hold you
And I' m still asking why
I guess that this is goodbye m
My I ' ve got our love to remember
That will never change
I have you in my head
And no I' ll never hold you
And I' m still asking why
I guess that this is goodbye m
My dreams suddenly seem so empty
I could go on my own
But I feel like playin dead
And for what feels like the first time
I don't know where you are tonight
I guess that this is goodbye
We lived half our lives together
A hundred years is a lot of weight to bear
An the sun, it maybe shining
But there' s an ocean in my eyes
' Cause I know that this is goodbye
I know that this is goodbye
