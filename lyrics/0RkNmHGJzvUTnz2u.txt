Back when you weren't succesful
Back when you were interesting
Back when we were in
the same boat making waves

Back in my head now
You've made yourself very hard to forget now
Do you remember that bridge in the midlands
They pulled apart just to see how it stood

But now you're something big in the city
So cruel to say but it's such a pity
So cruel to say
but I hope you lose your way

Back when we were inseperable
Back when you were a reckless one
Back when we'd get lost to get lost
Do you remember that mess

Now I return to Godmanchester
Back to the bridge and I
see that its still standing
I'm still that lost kid wrapping his head around forever

But now you're something big in the city
So cruel to say but it's such a pity
So cruel to say
but I hope you lose your way

And if you're lost
I will be waiting

Waiting on Godmanchester Chinese bridge

And if you're lost
I will be waiting

Waiting on Godmanchester Chinese bridge
