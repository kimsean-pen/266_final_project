I was looking for a change of scene

You were looking at a magazine

It was red carpets and limousines

And the grass seemed so much greener

All we wanted was to get there fast
So, we packed up everything we had
Runnin' on hope and a tank of gas
Like dreams ain't just for dreamers
We couldn't wait to leave that life behind
Trying to find salvation in that city limit sign

And one of those early nights
When the stars come out

Oh, the stars come out
And shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out

Oh, when the stars come out

Everybody's, somebody, someday
Everybody's got a part to play
Everybody's tryin' to find a way
To say, what needs saying
Everybody's got a friend of a friend
Somebody that can get you in
Begging angels for a sin
In a game that we're all playin'
You and I, we're gamblers

Solding cards that we can't see

And I'm betting on you and
You're betting on me

One of those early nights
When the stars came out
Oh, the stars come out
And shine
And they burn so bright

They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

Down on the freeway

The sun is out of sight
And I got a feelin'
Tonight might be the night
Yeah, tonight might be the night

One of those early nights
The stars come out
Oh, the stars come out
And shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out
When the stars come out
Ohwhoow
When the stars come out
