I put my heart in a red balloon
But I let it go to soon
Let it go on the boulevard
Where wicked winds blow so hard

Maybe had I looked up I would have seen that

The sky is full of red balloons
Red balloons are full of broken hearts
Broken hearts are floating by a chance
Will they burst or drift
Into arms
Will they burst or drift
Into arms

I put my voice in a red balloon
For you it sang too many tunes
Haunted by those melodies
I let it go with the breeze

Maybe had I looked up I would have seen that

The sky is full of red balloons
Red balloons are full of broken hearts
Broken hearts are floating by a chance
Will they burst or drift
Into arms
Will they burst or drift
Into arms

I put my eyes in a red balloon
To watch you with the light of the moon,
But seeing you holding hands
With another girl and making plans
Well I just had to set you free
And finally see, that

The sky is full of red balloons
Red balloons are full of broken hearts
Broken hearts are floating by a chance
Will they burst or drift
Into arms,
Will they burst or drift
Into arms
