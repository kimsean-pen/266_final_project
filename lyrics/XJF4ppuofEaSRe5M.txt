I read a play written today about a boy
Who hides in attics when the sun is up
Everyone is at work
What will I do? Where will I go?
Show me the way
The truth, the anger, show me rules of thumb
Show the way to grow old

Love is a guide
The endless river of the soul
But we are mean
The dried up riverbeds of rock and stone
Lust is my friend
She comes to me when I am tired

Life is a rope, death is a myth
Love is a fraud, it's misunderstood
Work is a sentence, family's a drag
This house is a trap

I read a play written today about a girl
She gets on perfectly with young and old
Everybody loves her
What would she wear? Cut off her hair?
Wave as she slides
Gracefully into the working week
She hides her baggage inside

She's got a friend
An ugly monster that will eat your face
She has to cry
A heavy cat of wasted time
She's got a friend
A lonely monster that will prey on you

Life is a secret, death is a myth
Love is a fraud, it's misunderstood
Work is a sentence, family's a drag
This house is a trap

Life is a secret, death is a myth
Love is a fraud, it's misunderstood
Work is a sentence, family's a drag
This house is a trap

I read a play written today about a boy
Tied in melancholy, takes the weight
Takes the weight of the world
I walked alone, loving a song
Walking the earth
The one-eyed sister who is twenty three
Dried and wrinkled, alone

I'll give you a month
To see past shadows in your secret night
I'll give you a week
To look Medusa in the eye
I'll give you a month
To notice heaven in the sight of stage

You'll keep inside of your head
You're sitting on the floor
You're pushing back the tide
So lift the mountain up
So tie writer's witness down
Assemble all your troops
Regards to all these metaphors
And suddenly she says, and suddenly she says
And away you too, and head for higher ground
And not the king of me
Take a chance and play for today
And build the sets and light the scene
A pretty air and we're upon the screen
And build the sets and light the scene
We'll break when we're on the sacred screen
The backstage of your life
Let's fill the glass and light to share the sun
The backstage of your life
Let's file the tables of the ones you love
