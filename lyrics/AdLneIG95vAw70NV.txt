Disappear from everyone
I hold so close to me
Fade away into the night
And hope it takes away the pain
If i fall asleep forever
For better or for worse
At least i won't be awake
To feel the guilt and regret
I always knew

I can't even cry
If i wanted to
And i'm sorry that i lie
When i talk to you

I don't remember
The last time i smiled
And meant it
I can't remember
The last time
I felt something real
