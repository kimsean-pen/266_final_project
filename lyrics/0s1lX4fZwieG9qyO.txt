Uh.
Yo, check it out. (What's up?)
I want you to pay attention to this, know'm saying?
Listen up, alright? (Ughh. Alright, man, alright). Yo
You bust lead? So do I.
Except mine impregnates the page giving birth to thoughts that unify
You fuck little girls. I make love to women
My words uplift, yours are poisonous like venom
I'm an M.C. You're a rapper
I'm as real as they come
while half the guys you idolize are just actors
You run from commitment I remain loyal
You call women bitches. I call them queens because they're royal
You make rap songs I make soul music!
When God speaks through rhythm will you go to it?
Yo, I save my cash yours you blow through it
I say your child's special you say he's so stupid
I'm pouring my heart out in everything written
You're scared you'll look soft heart remains hidden
Yo, on touchy subjects nerves I stay hittin'
But I ain't better than you I just think different
Is the glass half full or half empty?
It's based on your perspective quite simply
We're the same and we're not know what I'm saying listen
So I ain't better than you I just think different
Is the glass half full or half empty?
It's based on your perspective quite simply
We're the same and we're not know what I'm saying listen
So I ain't better than you I just think different
My fam run things, while you run your jewelry
Yo, my people pop lock you tough guys pop toolies
You rock gems I drop gems you Xerox copying
While I originate material to stimulate
Positive thought patterns when the chosen start gathering
We bar none, yo I got jokes you are one
I'm out doing it while you talk about it
I'm constantly in the mix, while you walk around it
You try, I do, I'm wise you're clueless.
I get the job done you fail and make excuses
I'm a gentlemen you're behaviors abusive
Yo, I'm patient... you're jumping the gun false start!
You're caught up in dress codes I'll shop at Walmart
Sucker I'm all heart you're half hearted!
Yo, you suckas are vandals we graf artist!
Thought you had the last laugh but we laugh hardest.

Is the glass half full or half empty?
It's based on your perspective quite simply
We're the same and we're not know what I'm saying listen
So I ain't better than you I just think different
You fall in love with body parts I connect mentally
With my female counterpart before we bond physically
Cats I chill with rap about revolution
While you rap about drug abuse and distribution
You wanna be like Mike well I wanna be me.
My queens hard to obtain while yours is easy
We both from Maryland but be reppin DC
We all front sometimes that's how MCs be
My word is bond and yours is worthless
You're mainstream I'm beneath the surface
I stay working hard while you're hardly workin'
All you want is "money and you're dick sucked" are you certain?
Yo, I want a better world for our seeds to live in.
I put faith in myself not the system
Yo we trying to travel so why you making pit stops?
You cats is rap and I'm HipHop!
