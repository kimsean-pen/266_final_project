I'll be the one to reload it when there's no bodies left for you
I won't be the one to condone it when I know that your time is through
So don't you blink an eye 'cause that's all it's gonna take
March yourself into the end and praise it every step of the way
March yourself into the end
I will find you
Open my eyes, I have been blind
I'll be the one to reload it just for you
