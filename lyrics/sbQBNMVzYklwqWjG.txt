I've been watching the weather where you are
To see where it is that you're taking my heart
I've been praying that you haven't lost it yet
'Cause it's times like these I don't want to forget

I could never understand
I'd have to ask him again and again
And I'd ask him again
It was out of my hands
I'd have to ask him again and again
And I'd ask him again

I've been watching for the tiniest warning signs
And I'm afraid they might be right
I've been praying for a tell-tale sign
So I can keep you there in the back of my mind
I'll keep you there in the back of my mind

I could never understand
I'd have to ask him again and again
And I'd ask him again
It was out of my hands
I'd have to ask him again and again
And I'd ask him again

You're with me again
Rain ribbons washing the floor of my room
Before A.M
I can feel you again
Holding the pieces together
The give and let go in the end
Holding the pieces together
The give and let go in the end
