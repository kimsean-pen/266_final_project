I dream in blue
I drown in dew
I left home on account of you
always loving someone new
I dream in blue.

I gave my time
Dollar and dime.
I left home on account of wine
making me believe your mind
I gave my time.

I looked away
day after day
I left home on account of rain
slowing down my glory train
I looked away.

I've seen those crows
All in a row
I left home on account on snow
buried all the things I know
I've seen those crows

I dream in blue
I drown in dew
I left home on account of you
always loving someone new.
I dream in blue.

I left home on account of you
always loving someone new.
I dream in blue.

I dream in blue.
I dream in blue.
I.
