Well... you didn't wake up this morning
Because you didn't go to bed.
You were watching the whites of your eyes turn red.
The calendar on your wall is ticking the days off.
You've been reading some old letters --
You smile and think how much you've changed.
All the money in the world
Couldn't buy back those days.

You pull back the curtains, and the sun burns into your eyes,
You watch a plane flying across a clear blue sky.
This is the day
Your life will surely change.
This is the day
When things fall into place.

You could've done anything if you'd wanted
And all your friends and family think that you're lucky.
But the side of you they'll never see
Is when you're left alone with the memories
That hold your life together like glue

You pull back the curtains, and the sun burns into your eyes,
You watch a plane flying across a clear blue sky.
This is the day
Your life will surely change.
This is the day
When things fall into place.

This is the day (this is the day)
your life will surely change

This is the day (this is the day)
your life will surely change

This is the day (this is the day)
your life will surely change

This is the day (this is the day)
your life will surely change

This is the day (this is the day)
your life will surely change...
