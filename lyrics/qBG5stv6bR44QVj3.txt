Life is a struggle
We're being prepared to delve in the greater parts of us
It's the one fight in our lives that we have to win
No choice but to win, to believe that we can win

Life can be so hard to take, sometimes it seems the only safe
Way to get through the day, wait till it goes away
Dreams can be so hard to fake, a lying smile, beautiful face
So I'm telling you to wait, no, this is not your fate
These begging hearts invoking dreams in broken lives, heartbroken spines
Breaking hearts on borrowed time; like broken records, we keep trying
What I wouldn't give to see that broken child inside of me
Tell him it's gonna be alright, the world is worth the fight

The light will find us even if it blinds us
Our time defines us, nothing can divide us
If we sing, if we sing
If we sing, if we sing

Give me something to believe in
Do you suffer just the same?
Just give me something to believe in
As the world walks away
Is it too much to take?
Is there too much to say?
So as long as I am breathing
I need something to believe in

It's the one fight in our lives that we have to win

I see so many pieces of you broken, this is not the end
Just follow in these footsteps, maybe I could even hold you dead
I'd take you in a single breath, I'd never ever breathe again
We'd make another heaven where every single heart can mend
Listen up, hear me out, I'm the one who's searching now
Hold your hope, don't hold it down, you once were lost, but now you're found
What I wouldn't give to see that grace inside of you and me
I know it's gonna be alright, the world is worth the fight

The light will find us even if it blinds us
Our time defines us, nothing can divide us
If we sing, if we sing
If we sing, if we sing

Give me something to believe in
Do you suffer just the same?
Just give me something to believe in
As the world walks away
Is it too much to take?
Is there too much to say?
So as long as I am breathing
I need something to believe in

Belief is all that we have, but belief is all that we need
I remember when I was a kid, fearless against the wind, brought down by the storm within
But from the bottom of a sea, I sang again, and again, and again, and again
Belief is all that we have, but belief is all that we need
