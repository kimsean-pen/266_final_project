When the nature gives her powers
Back to the earth
And the colors

Ablaze in the shades of flames
Like fire itself
Is dancing on the branches

Days grow shorter
Where the light escapes
The darkness will follow

This night that brings the ground frost
Will summon the winds
To carry the veil of the snow

Crushing is the force
Flood of cold

The gale of the end
Age of ice unfolds

Long gone is the warmth
And the light of the sun

Long gone is the fire in the sky
Replaced by the northern lights

Long gone are the twilights

I breathe the wind
That carries the promise
From dawn of the times

I breathe the air
That carries the fall
Cold and raw
