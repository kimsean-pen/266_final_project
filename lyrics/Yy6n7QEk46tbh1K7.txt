My mind is a warrior
My heart is a foreigner
My eyes are the color of red like a sunset
I'll never keep it bottled up
And left to the hands of the coroner
Be a true heart, not a follower
We're not done yet

And I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
I'll never let you down
And I'm keeping on the down low
And I'll keep you around so I'll know
That I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down.

You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade eight
But I never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down, now
You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade eight
But I never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down, now

My eyes are a river filler
This drink is a liver killer
My chest is a pillow for my weary head to lay to rest again
Your body is my ballpoint pen
And your mind is my new best friend
Your eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again, now

And I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around so I'll know
That I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down

You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade eight
But I never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade eight
But I never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down

Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down

You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade eight
But I never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
You're strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade eight
But I never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
