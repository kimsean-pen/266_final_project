The air my lungs first loved carves craters from my eyes
They said "Breathe deeply son, or be the next to die"

Beneath the falling night
And heaven's shutting gate
Pray keep your tongue held tight
Or suffer the same fate

The blood on our black gloves
It is none of your concern
You want to call our bluff
Get in line and wait your turn
And watch the witches burn

Don't flinch when innocents are dancing with the flames
If they wanted to live, they'd learn to play the game
You can still walk away if you just hold your tongue
If you'd just walk away, you'd live to see the sun

But under this killing moon
Under this burning sky
The fire's shining groom
I hold my breath and close my eyes

The blood on our black gloves
It is none of your concern
You want to call our bluff
Get in line and wait your turn

The blood on our black gloves
It is none of your concern
You want to call our bluff
Get in line and wait your turn
And watch the witches burn
Burn
We'll watch the witches burn
Burn
Burn
Burn
We'll watch the witches burn.
