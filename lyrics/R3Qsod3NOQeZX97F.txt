Run past the rivers, run past all the light.
Feel it crashing and burning, till it all collides.
Strike a match lit the fire, shining up the sky.
As it all comes down again.
As it all comes down again.
As it all comes down again, to the sound.

The sound of the wind is whispering in your head
Can you feel it coming back?
Through the warmth, through the cold, keep running till we're there.
We're coming home now, we're coming home now.
The sound of the wind is whispering in your head
Can you feel it coming back?
Through the warmth, through the cold, keep running till we're there.
We're coming home now, we're coming home now

Hear the voices surround us, hear them screaming out.
We'll be crying for mercy, we'll be crying out loud.
Burn the bridges in our town 'till the point where we drown.
As it all comes down again.
As it all comes down again.
As it all comes down again, to the sound.

The sound of the wind is whispering in your head.
Can you feel it coming back?
Through the warmth, through the cold, keep running till we're there.
We're coming home now, we're coming home now.
The sound of the wind is whispering in your head.
Can you feel it coming back?
Through the warmth, through the cold, keep running till we're there.
We're coming home now, we're coming home now.

We are coming home, we are coming home
we are coming home, we are coming home

The sound of the wind is whispering in your head.
Can you feel it coming back?
Through the warmth, through the cold, keep running till we're there
We're coming home now, we're coming home now.
The sound of the wind is whispering in your head
can you feel it coming back?
Through the warmth, through the cold, keep running till we're there.
We're coming home now, we're coming home now
