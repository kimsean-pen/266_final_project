If only for a second, let me have you
Tell me all your secrets, let me know you

Paint me all your pictures
Hang them on my wall
Show me all your color
Show me all

Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Fall in line with what you're meant to be...
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Fall in line with what you're meant to be...

A fire burns into you
Purifying all
And what I saw was opulence and
That's not for me

And that's not for me
And that's not for me

Only in summertime (only in summertime)
Only in summertime (only in summertime)
Things will change with time (things will change with time)
Only in summertime

Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Fall in line with what you're meant to be...
Open up your eyes
Open up your mind
Fall in line with what you're meant to be...

Only in summertime (only in summertime)
Only in summertime (only in summertime)
Things will change with time (things will change with time)
Only in summertime
