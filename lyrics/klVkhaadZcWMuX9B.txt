Bad time for a good time baby, a bad time

You never finish your glass, take a little sip and you're bored
Down in the apartment below wouldn't even open your door
You said it's a bad time for a good time baby, a bad time
Too many times I've asked myself what did I come here for
Now I know you wanna talk about it, talk about it, yeah
Suddenly you're into me again
Let's talk about it, talk about it, yeah
I've been dying to use the line

I'm sorry, but you've called at a bad time
And every time is probably gonna be a bad time
Sorry, but it's not like the last time
When you were calling me and hoping for a good time
Bad time for a good time baby
A bad time
You should know about it by now
Bad time for a good time baby
A bad time
You should know about it by now
You should know about it by now, yeah

Everything's so clear to me now, wish I could've seen it before
You were sitting comfortable and I was busy kissing your floor
Now I know you wanna talk about it, talk about it, yeah
Suddenly you're into me again
Let's talk about it, talk about it, yeah
I've been dying to use the line

I'm sorry, but you've called at a bad time
And every time is probably gonna be a bad time
Sorry, but it's not like the last time
When you were calling me and hoping for a good time
Bad time for a good time baby
A bad time
