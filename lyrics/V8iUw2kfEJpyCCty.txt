When I'm feeling blue
All I have to do
Is take a look at you
Then I'm not so blue
When you're close to me

I can feel your heart beat
I can hear you breathing in my ear
Wouldn't you agree
Baby you and me

We've got a groovy kind of love

Any time you want to
You can turn me on to
Anything you want to
Any time at all
When I kiss your lips
Ooh I start to shiver
Can't control the quivering inside
Wouldn't you agree
Baby you and me
We've got a groovy kind of love
Woah
When I'm feeling blue
All I have to do
Is take a look at you
Then I'm not so blue
When I'm in your arms
Nothing seems to matter
My whole world could shatter
I don't care
Wouldn't you agree
Baby you and me
We've got a groovy kind of love
We've got a groovy kind of love
We've got a groovy kind of love
Oho, woah
We've got a groovy kind of love
