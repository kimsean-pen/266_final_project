I've been following any road I can find
Sifting through the pieces that you left behind
Fallin' in and out until I feel nothing inside
What's tonight?
What's tonight?

I can't keep on living with a delicate mind
If I make a coffee, can we act like we're fine?
When we were tangled in the sheets
And waking up in our bed
'Cause now you strangle me in my sleep
And I wake up with you in my head

Oh oh Oh oh
I thought you loved me
Oh oh
I thought, I thought

Runnin' through memories I can't keep anymore
I don't want any when I empty my drawer
You left your messy stems on your hotel floor
What for?
What for?

I can't find an ending 'til I'm on my own
If I leave a light on, can I pretend you're coming home?
I was on my knees to be with you
You don't want me this way
Why can't I reason with you to stay?
Yeah

Oh oh Oh oh
I thought you loved me

Oh oh
I thought, I thought wrong
Oh oh
I thought, I thought wrong
Oh oh
I thought, I thought wron-ong
I thought, I thought wrong
I thought, I thought wrong
I thought, I thought wrong
I thought, I thought wrong
