Had a bad day again
She said I would not understand
She left a note and said "I'm sorry I
Had a bad day again"

She spilled her coffee, broke her shoelace
Smeared the lipstick on her face
Slammed the door and said "I'm sorry I
Had a bad day again"

And she swears there's nothing wrong
I hear her playing that same old song
She puts me off and puts me on

And had a bad day again
She said I would not understand
Left a note and said "I'm sorry I
I had a bad day again"

And she swears there's nothing wrong
I hear her playing that same old song
She puts me off and puts me on

And had a bad day again
She said I would not understand
She left a note and said "I'm sorry I
I had a bad day again"
She left a note and said "I'm sorry I
Had a bad day"

Alright
