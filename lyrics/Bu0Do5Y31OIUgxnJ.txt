You will be the lucky one?
Who will see the deadly one?
You will die on your knees
By the hand of Mr. Freeze

Will you see when the rest are blind?
Will you remain frozen in time?

Will you flee underground?
Watch the blanket search the ground
You will die on your knees
By the hand of Mr. Freeze

Horror awaits for those who evade
Ice cold blood stops in their veins

Arm yourselves to the "T"
Repel the threat of Mr. Freeze
See the blood drop in your eyes
See your family burned alive

I don't even know you, I just know where you live
I've raided your child's bedroom, burned his virgin skin
I'd crucify your nation, I'll leave your dead to rot
I'll praise your damaged street and bear an iron cross

The oceans have been ripped away
It does no good to pray
All todays cataclysm
Men restore to cannibalism

I'm worth all you'd care for, then I'll fuck you in the ass
Oh, so fucking happy as I kick your face and laugh
Today's war stories, at night I can hear you scream
There's blood on your pillow, this is no bad dream
You try to think of reason and all you can do is scream!
