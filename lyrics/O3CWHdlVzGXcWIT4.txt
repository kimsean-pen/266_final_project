I wanna be a cult classic
Black boys wrapped in plastic
Yeah stuntin is a habit
Whatever you want you can have it
I always give a lot of lee-way
Don't mistake for a pre-pay
Don't wanna listen to your hearsay
We hit the beach up like it's D-day
We stay solving all your problems
But last I checked you were the one with the plug

But I'm glad we met
Hears a participation medal
Straight from Geppetto
(With your fake ass)

So you wanna be bad
But my skin is my apparel
So say no to a fad
In this life we were meant to fail

Just take a moment on the offer
New words same lies to prosper
Follow purpose its an honor
We really wanna do it proper
Yeah its always been about me
They see i struggle to be carefree
You been testing my patience
I love but I'm anxious
A life for the thankless I know
Still solving all of your problems
But last i checked you were the one with the plug

But I'm glad we met
Here's a participation medal
Straight from Geppetto
(With your fake ass)
So you wanna be bad
But my skin is my apparel
So say no to a fad
In this life we were meant to fail

Everything could always be better
Guilty conscious light as a feather
Meanings always honest in spite of your mind
Stop changing your mind on me
Do it 'cause you know it don't matter
Live it like you mean it whatever
Something bout intention that makes all the difference
I wanna be different
