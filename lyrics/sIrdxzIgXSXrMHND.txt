Constant resistance against your control
Empty existence, your life as a whole
Despair and weakness will live here no more
Watch as the life drains from you on the floor

Lost sight, lost life

Shadow their lives cause you do not believe
Lacking remorse you have no soul to bleed
Pushing the boundaries of what you should not
Rising against you in war and in thought

Lost sight, lost life

Rise from the ashes the fallen will fight
Voice from the masses that bleeds through the night
Birth of your enemy, we've come for your life
We were just memories, but now we're alive
