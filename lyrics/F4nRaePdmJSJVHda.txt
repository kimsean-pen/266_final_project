Mist lights the Black Sky,
As the Legion of Seven arise,
Armed with Seven Trumpets,
The Seven Heavens of Chaos.

Sounds of the Abyss are heard,
The Final Dawn is awaiting,
Deep and ever drowning,
The Gateways are finally open.

The Baptismal Fonts,
Turning to rotten Blood,
Eclipsing of all Stars,
The Mystery of God is gone.

Star falls from the Heaven,
With the Key to the Abyss,
One Hand holds the Doom,
To Men without the Seal.

The Chaos is My Order,
The Darkness is My Light.

Sounds of the Abyss are heard,
The Final Dawn is awaiting,
Deep and ever drowning,
The Gateways finally open.
