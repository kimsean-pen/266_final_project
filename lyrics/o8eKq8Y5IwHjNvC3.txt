Sleeping with a time bomb
Rumble in my dreams
Innocence been gone long
Fall apart at the seams
Looking through the windows
Walking through the doors
I cant help this feeling
I've been here before
Everything is different
Everything's the same
I know the rules
I played the games
Cry out
Tell me what its gonna be
Reach out
Is everything the same
Cry out
Tell me what you really see
Reach out
As coma steals my name
Wake to an explosion
Nothing seemed so real
Innocence corroding
Alone is all I feel
Reaching out to no one
Knowing no one's there
Afraid to be afraid
Of another nameless fear
I got all the reasons
Don't need no more
Blinded by illusion
Locked behind the door
Sleeping now forever
Murdered in my dreams
Innocence was never
Goin to extremes
Bustin through the windows
Kickin down the doors
Standin up to me
Never did before
Now I lay me down to sleep
And if I die before I wake
