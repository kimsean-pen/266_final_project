Hello, reaper
Have we met?
Still so many things I haven't said
Hello, darkness
Here again
Last I saw you I was tangled in my head
Hello, sadness
Are you here to stay?
Right when things were finally going my way
I met this angel
She taught me to fly
Yeah, she showed me all the colors of the sky

So please, don't take her away
But if you do
I'm just skin and bones
I know that there's room

When the man in black comes to cash his check
And you're holding on to your final breath
When you walk out the door, know that I will too
I hope they build coffins for two

When I was younger
I used to pray
That my life was more that the sum of my mistakes
And now you're here
Dressed in white
Guess you heard my voice on all those lonely nights
Now we're older
But you look brand new
Every day I'm falling more in love with you
When you're tired
And your eyes close
You won't have to take your final walk alone

So if forever leaves too soon
Only skin and bones
I know that there's room

When the man in black comes to cash his check
And you're holding on to your final breath
When you walk out the door, know that I will too
I hope they build coffins for two

I'm never leaving you
Coffins for two
I'm never leaving you

When the man in black comes to cash his check
And you're holding on to your final breath
When you walk out the door, know that I will too
I hope they build coffins for two
I hope they build coffins for two
