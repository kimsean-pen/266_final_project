We walked these streets like kings, our faces in the wind
And everywhere we were, we made the city sing
We sang "forever young," we had our fingers crossed
And when the city sleeps, it dreams of us
Yeah, it still does

Oh, love, it changes shapes; it glows in many shades
We won't be gone as long as our echoes resonate
We need no photographs; the past's not only past
I find us everywhere and that's how the magic lasts

Cause everywhere we've been, we have been leaving traces
They won't ever disappear
We were here, we were here, we were really here
And the rains get rough, but time can't wash us off
We won't ever disappear
We were here, it was really love
Everywhere we've been, we have been leaving traces
They won't ever disappear
We were here, we were here, we were really here
And the rains get rough, but time can't wash us off
We won't ever disappear
We were here, it was really love

It's only little things: footmarks and fingerprints, a treasure hunt through town
It's full of evidence, our monuments are all around
Everything's on the move; the paint is wet, all colors are new
But if you look carefully, you'll see us shining through
Cause everywhere we've been, we have been leaving traces
They won't ever disappear
We were here, we were here, we were really here
And the rains get rough, but time can't wash us off
We won't ever disappear
We were here, it was really love
Everywhere we've been, we have been leaving traces
Everywhere we've been, we have been leaving traces
And the rains get rough, but time can't wash us off
We won't ever disappear
We were here, it was really love

We were here, we were here, we were really here
We were here, we were here, we were really here
We were here, we were here, we were really here
We were here, we were here, we were really here
We were here, we were here, we were really here

We're in the air, we're in the water
From the rooftops down to the pier
I'll never walk these streets alone
We were here, we were here, we were really here
Engraved into waves; invisible ink on the walls
We were here, we were here, we were really here
