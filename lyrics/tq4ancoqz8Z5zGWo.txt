Don't call me nigga or rapper
My motherfucking name is Michael Eagle, I'm sovereign
I'm from a line of ghetto superheroes, I holla
I got something to bring to your attention, attention, attention, attention, attention
I promise you I will never fit in your descriptions, I'm giant
Don't let nobody tell you nothing different, they lyin'
A giant and my body is a building, a building, a building, a building

No services underground
No sound, when I'm calling home
City broken my brothers down
Now I'm standing here all alone
Sun weathered my monochrome
My hollow bones David Bowie told me I'm not alone
I'm overgrown, but these model homes
Still here, if it's hot or cold
Still here, if my body move
Still standing on Cottage Grove
Still do what I gotta do
Stone tablet on stone tablet
I'm old granite, I'm not a tomb
Y'all can move this whole planet
I'll hold fast and I follow through
I promise you
