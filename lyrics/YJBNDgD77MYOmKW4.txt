I want to know if you can change your life and not betray your own soul
i just want to know but i don't care who you are.
I want to know if you can see the beauty and don't hide your eyes
i don't want to know how did you get here.

I don't care what you have lived
I don't care how old you are

I want to know if you stayed open after betrayals of life
i just want to know but i don't care who you are.
i want to know if you still want to risk and lose your way home
i don't want to know how did you get here.

I don't care what you have lived
I want to know what you are now
