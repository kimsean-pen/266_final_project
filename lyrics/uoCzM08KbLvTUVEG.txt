That night, I was holding ... again
I would never appear to say,
that you were the best

We fell in not too long after
Now it's zooming out again
Several times like that

Still I've got all my ways my one thousand ways
You will never rise to the taste
I am an actor baby, full of stone
back one start again
I am an actor baby, full of stone
back one start again
I am an actor baby, full of stone
back one start again

Back then, consider it all remains
Did you have the nerve
Guards been pulled apart
I was, I admit it, I was still feeling apart
You would've caved, still feel the same
I'm in my car you'll never see me again
Just wanna hold you babe
Together we're forever cause forever remains

(I am an actor baby, full of stone
back one start again)
(I am an actor baby, full of stone
back one start again)
(I am an actor baby, full of stone
back one start again)
(I am an actor baby, full of stone
back one start again)
I am an actor baby, full of stone
back one start again
I am an actor baby, full of stone
back one start again

I am an actor baby
(full of stone, back one start again)
I am an actor baby
(full of stone, back one start again)
I am an actor baby, full of stone
back one start again
I am an actor baby, full of stone
back one start again
I am an actor baby, full of stone
back one start again
I am an actor baby, full of stone
back one start again
