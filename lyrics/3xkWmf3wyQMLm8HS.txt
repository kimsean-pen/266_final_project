It's hard to see you when your shrouded by smoke,
When I'm at the country fair,
With the night time sky,
Blowing through your hair.
I'm trying and I'm trying to keep my composure,
But I better hurry up, because your coming closer.
Girl your making me breathe, harder than I can believe.

You took one step, two step, three closer to me;
And I'm shakin' like a leaf on a maple tree.
I wipe the sweat off my brow, gotta straighten up;
Gotta catch my breath, gotta loosen up for you,
For you,
For you,
For you,
For you.

We can ride the Ferris wheel
And touch the stars;
And bump into each other on bumper cars.
The night is young,
And so are we,
We'll be seventeen forever 'till were '93.
We can last forever, we can last a lifetime;
Just me and you

You took one step, two step, three closer to me;
And I'm shakin' like a leaf on a maple tree.
I wipe the sweat off my brow, gotta straighten up;
Gotta catch my breath, gotta loosen up for you,
For you,
For you,
For you,
For you.
