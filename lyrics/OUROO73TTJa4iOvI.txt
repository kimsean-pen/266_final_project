Well, my pad is very messy
And there's whiskers on my chin
And I'm all hung up on music
And I always play to win
I ain't got no time for loving
'Cause my time is all used up
Just to sit around creating
All that groovy kind of stuff

'Cause I'm a man
Yes, I am
And I can't help but love you so
Well, I'm a man
Yes, I am
And I can't help but love you so

Well, if I had my choice of matter
I would rather be with cats
All engrossed in mental chatter
Showing where our minds are at
And relating to each other
Just how strong our will can be
In resisting all involvement
With each groovy chick we see

Well, I'm a man
Yes, I am
And I can't help but love you so
Well, I'm a man
Yes, I am
And I can't help but love you so

Said I got to keep my image
While suspended on a throne
That looks out upon a kingdom
Filled with people all unknown
Who imagine I'm not human
And my heart is made of stone
And I never had no problems
And my toilet's trimmed with gold

Well, I'm a man
Yes, I am
And I can't help but love you so
Well, I'm a man
Yes, I am
And I can't help but love you so
