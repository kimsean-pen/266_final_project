When the sun goes down on my side of town
That lonesome feeling, comes to my door
The whole world, turns blue

There's a rundown bar, 'cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two, way in the back
Where I sit alone and think of you

I spend most every night
Beneath the light of a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams, dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

I think of two young lovers
Running wild and free
I close my eyes and sometimes see
You in the shadows of this smoke-filled room

No telling how many tears
I've sat here and cried or how many lies that I've lied
Telling my poor heart
You will come back one day

I spend most every night
Beneath the light of a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams, dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

But I'll be alright as long as there's light
From a neon moon
And I'll be alright as long as there's light
From a neon moon
