I'm trying to change
To make the best, for us
But I'm just the same
Same as I ever was

Oh and if you stay with me
Honestly it's what I want
But if you stay with me
I know I'll hurt you more

So won't you save,
Save yourself
By leaving me now
For someone else
If I'm crying out
Don't listen to it
It's only in my heart
Save yourself
It's only in my heart
Oh no

So tell me I'm gone
Please won't you change, my mind
This feels so intense
Sometimes it can lead, you blind

Oh and if you stay with me
Honestly it's what I want
But if you stay with me
I know I'll hurt you more

So won't you save,
Save yourself
By leaving me now
For someone else
If I'm crying out
Don't listen to it
It's only in my heart
Save yourself
It's only in my heart
Oh no

And I don't want
To let you go
But I know
It's the right thing to do baby
And I don't think
I'm that strong
To say goodbye
I don't wanna see you cry

So won't you save,
Save yourself
By leaving me now
For someone else
If I'm crying out
Don't listen to it
It's only in my heart
Save yourself

It's only in my heart
Save yourself

It's only in my heart

It's only in my heart
Only, only in my heart
