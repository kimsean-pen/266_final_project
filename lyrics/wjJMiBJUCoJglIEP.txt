Am I playin' it safe?
I've been here for too long
Haven't made a mistake
There's a reason to stay -
'Cause I feel so alone

Make up resons to wait
Run so nothing goes wrong
But everything that she said, I'm overthinkin' while I'm drivin' back home

'Cause she said, "Call me up when you're all alone 'cause I'm down for hangin' out
We'll stay up all night and I'll just crash on your couch.
Call me up when you're all alone 'cause I'm down for hangin' out
We'll stay up all night and I'll just crash on your couch."

Keep tellin' myself:
Maybe that's her, that's girl I've been tryin' to find
Maybe that's her, that's girl
I'm just terrified
And maybe that's her
How will I know if I never try?
Maybe that's her, that's the girl, that's the girl
I've been waitin' for
I've been waitin' for

Am I playin' it safe?
I don't know anymore
Do I keep pushin' away
'Cause I'm just too afraid that someone's gonna get hurt

'Cause she said, "Call me up when you're all alone 'cause I'm down for hangin' out
We'll stay up all night and I'll just crash on your couch.
Call me up when you're all alone 'cause I'm down for hangin' out"

Keep tellin' myself:
Maybe that's her, that's girl I've been tryin' to find
Maybe that's her, that's girl
I'm just terrified
And maybe that's her
How will I know if I never try?
Maybe that's her, that's the girl, that's the girl
I've been waitin' for
I've been waitin' for

Am I playin' it safe?
Is she waitin' for me?
'Cause maybe that's her, that's girl I've been tryin' to find
Maybe that's her, that's girl
I'm just terrified
And maybe that's her
How will I know if I never try?
Maybe that's her, that's the girl, that's the girl
I've been waitin' for
I've been waitin' for
