Mind over matter
Does it matter to any of us
Don't change the subject
I'm heavy on your love
I missed that train
New York City, it rains
Fly to East L.A. in big jet planes
You know you're on my mind

And if the world don't break
I'll be shaking it
'Cause I'm a young man after all, oooh ooh
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall, oooh ooh ooh

Mind over matter
I'm in tatters thinking 'bout her
Taste my disaster
It's heavy on my tongue
All the lights aglow
Tokyo, snows
Go to watch the show
Curtain's closed
I'm watching you this time

And if the world don't break
I'll be shaking it
'Cause I'm a young man after all, oooh ooh
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me
Cuz I'm a young man built to fall, oooh ooh

(I missed that train)
New York City, it rains
(Fly to East L.A.)
In big jet planes
You know you're on my mind
(All the lights aglow)
Tokyo, snows
(Go to watch the show)
Curtain's closed
I'm watching you this time

Mind over matter
Mind over matter

You know you're on my mind

And if the world don't break
I'll be shaking it
'Cause I'm a young man after all, oooh ooh

And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me
(Fly to East L.A.)
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall, oooh ooh
And if the world don't break
Tokyo, snows
Go to watch the show; curtain's closed

And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall, oooh ooh
