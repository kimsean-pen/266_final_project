Cannot wait the hours
Till you find me
Climb up to the tower
So that you could see

Waltz in the flowers where they found you
Cannot wait the hours
Would it be untrue
Climb up to the tower
So that you can see
All across the hours

Frightened eyes
Looking back at me
Change your mind
Don't care about me
Frightened eyes
Looking back at me
Change your mind
Don't leave with out me
Frightened eyes

Made in your reflection
So that you can feel
Mad in your intentions
Feel it isn't real
All the recollections
Spinning in a field
Left in your possession
Till it isn't real
Say it isn't real

Frightened eyes
Looking back at me
Change your mind
Don't care about me
Frightened eyes
Looking back at me
Change your mind
Don't leave with out me
Frightened eyes

It's deeper than you can breathe
It's farther than you could see
It's too much to ask of me
It's all in the glass you'll see
It's deeper than you can breathe
It's all in the glass you'll see
It's farther than we could be
It's deeper than you and me
Frightened eyes
