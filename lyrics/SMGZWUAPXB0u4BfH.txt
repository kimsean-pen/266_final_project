Now my sheets grow, cold as I am sleeping
Where my thoughts go, no one will be grieving
But I can't stop, wondering how long it will be

'Till I stop wondering, I stop wondering
'Till I stop wondering, I stop wondering
If you are ever here at all

Oh, oh
Let the moonlight, keep me from the darkness
Well soon I, will sleep beneath the forest
Of lost souls, wondering in and out of love

Yeah
'Till I stop wondering, I stop wondering
'Till I stop wondering, I stop wondering
If you are ever here at all

Remembering, the cold snow
Remembering, if you love at all
Just wait for I fall
I stop wondering, I stop wondering
I stop wondering, I stop wondering
If you are ever here at all
