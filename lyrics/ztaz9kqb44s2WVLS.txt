Oh I have been wondering where I have been pondering
Where I've been lately is no concern of yours
Who's been touching my skin
Who have I been letting
Shy and tired-eyed am I to day

I'm wounded by dust
All I have been wondering where I have been pondering
Where I've been lately is no concern of yours
Who's been touching my skin
Who have I been letting
Shy and tired-eyed am I today

Sometimes I sit, sometimes I stare
Sometimes they look and I don't care
Rarely I weep, sometimes I must
I'm wounded by dust

When the bell toll, when the bell gon' chime
You better call for your woman up high
And when the bell tolls for your last day,
You'll be getting down on your knees to pray
I'm a good woman and I never did say
whatever it was that you did that day
I'm not a woman to go and place blame
but you said that it was coming on judgement day

Now Sophia
I'm wounded by dust

When the bell toll, when the bell gon' chime
You better call for your woman up high
And when the bell tolls for your last day,
You'll be getting down on your knees to pray
I'm a good woman and I never did say
whatever it was that you did that day
I'm not a woman to go and place blame
but you said that it was coming on judgement day

Now Sophia
I'm wounded by dust
Now Sophia
