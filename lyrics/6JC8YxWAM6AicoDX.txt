Looking bright moving on
Some people say i'm dreaming
And yeah it's safe to say while i'm awake
All the world is sleeping

I shut my eyes, I shut my eyes
We can only get up, only get up
Through this and it might not be so.
Give me something, give me something to sell
Cause I ain't him, and I ain't her
I ate my way through this house

As you guys do tricks
It doesn't work
I can't relate

Scared to sleep
Scared of him
Hangin'round me
Hovering down (no matter where I start
I will keep my heart in the dark
When she whispers I don't hear her till she barks)
Leave the light on, leave the light on

Got no mean, got no bone
Don't have one finished idea
But I have to say no matter what you say
Moses never walked on water
Another plaid shirt on the back of a chair
Another letter sent it never got there
Never knew that you could be so.
Just a stop just a step in the climb
This isn't it you must admit
There is more around the corner

Don't hide don't shut yourself out
Don't fear what people say

Scared to sleep
Scared of him
Hangin'round me
Hovering down (no matter where I start
I will keep my heart in the dark
When she whispers I don't hear her till she barks)
Leave the light on, leave the light on
