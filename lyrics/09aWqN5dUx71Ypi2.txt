Here I am with my desire
Feel it burning just for you
My oh my, this love divine
Is taking me to somewhere new

Just slide
Get your body down, down, down
And glide
I gotta feel you all around

Boy you got me wanting more, more, more
Give it all up for love babe
You got me saying more, more, more
Wind me up, wind me up
You know I want you more, more, more
Gotta give it all up for love babe
You got me saying more, more, more
Baby, just fill me up to the top
Till I can't take no more
No more

Here am I and deep inside
I got a little spot for you
Make me sigh with sheer delight
As baby you caress and soothe

Just slide
Get your body down, down, down
And glide
I gotta feel you all around

Give it up, give it up
I just can't get enough
So give me more, more, more, more, more
