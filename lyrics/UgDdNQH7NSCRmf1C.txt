I want power, because it feels good.
I want power - I'll wash America with blood.
I want power: a clear blue light in the sky.
I feel power, running through my veins and out my eyes
And into empty, godforsaken minds without reality.
I feel power. I feel a sacrifice.
I am dead to right or wrong.
I want power, just like our father knew.
I want power, I'll put my hands in you.
I want power, though the earth is lost and spinning.
I feel power, buried in the ground where twenty million
Died like heroes stealing this same power that I'm feeling.
I feel power. I feel a sacrifice.
Now my blood is feeling clean.
And I feel the power burning like a spear inside of me.
I feel good. I feel right.
I feel a sacrifice.
