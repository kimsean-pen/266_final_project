I don't wanna be the one
To stop you from having fun
I've held you back for long enough
It was different when we fell in love

I see these things I never saw
You love me, I love you more
Not wasted time, but treasured years
It doesn't have to end in tears

I must admit, I momentarily fell into your maze
I must admit, I momentarily missed the good old days

It seems as though, you can't decide
Now it's time, I swallowed my pride
And put it all on the line
I told you not to waste my time
You're the sweetest thing, but you cut me deep
I can't eat and I can't sleep
I say these things, these cliche things
And now they all, make sense to me

I must admit, I momentarily fell into your maze
I must admit, I momentarily missed the good old days

The saddest thing's, I'm on the line
And you know, you got my time
You got my heart, you got my mind
You got my soul, and I'm not fine

I must admit, I momentarily fell into your maze
I must admit, I momentarily missed the good old days
