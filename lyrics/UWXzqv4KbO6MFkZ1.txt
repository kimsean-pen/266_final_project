All by the touch
You rip my heart and all the keys
Is it not much? Oh ...
What'd be more than what you squeeze
I've got no ammo ammo ammo ammo
And I hope you see
And recognize
The only door to paradise
I'm gonna keep
I know I need to get it done
Five miles deep, Oh ...
Rush into your latest turn
No drop kayo kayo kayo kayo
Cuz I see it through
Come over me
Take my love you have never seen

My love for you taste like summer, and chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Taste like the summer, and chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Taste like the summer, and chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie

Nobody sees
What we came do the other night
Drown in the sea, oh ...
Hold on your breath before footlight
Shake like never never never never
Never been in love
No, nothing's wrong
If we're hanging on so long

Are you against
Or you just don't wanna try
Are you bit tensed, oh
Let it fly the other sky
Play my tempo tempo tempo tempo
As you feel inside
Slow motion crime
I'm way more to get your mime

My love for you taste like summer, and chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Taste like the summer, and chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Taste like the summer, and chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie

My love for you taste like summer, and chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Taste like the summer, and chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Taste like the summer, and chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate cookie
