To be the motion actor,
Two broken strings, attracted,
To groom my face in life and doom

Hesitate to throw a coin in,
A wish could be a bad thing,
My mouth is just a mush of drool

Standing on the bridge I
Wink at you from up high
A talking fish comes as she moves

I want to be like water
And never need a doctor
And carve the earth without my tools

do it all

All the things that I relate to well,
Like authors and painters
Transparent paper wings
That float above me while I sleep
To make the room more natural
So we could die in it and die in it and die

The color after sunset
You'd do anything to jinx it,
It'll crush your sculpture just like a willow,
He doesn't need a house
His shoes will walk for miles
There's a gypsies face make on my pill.

I want to be like water and slip into your throat
And make you feel alive and good

I want to be like water and never have a doubt and
reflect what is around my pool

Do it all

All the things that I relate to them
Like authors and painters,
Transparent paper wings
That float above me while i sleep
To make the room more natural
So we could die in it and die in it and die.

And all the dreams that I awake to read like ghostly paintings
And all the things I hate, I wish I didn't have to hate
To find a room that's natural
To live and die in it, live and die, live and die.

I don't think you know just what you're doing
You pretend to know exactly all the things you keep on moving
Said I don't think I know exactly what I'm doing
But I tend to know exactly all the things you keep on moving

When you wake up from your snoozin'
I'll tell you how to do it my way
I'll tell you what I'm doin'
There's a knife up in the drawer

Anybody try to stop it
And I'll find out where you're stompin'
And it's all about the days you spend
Without me at our home.
