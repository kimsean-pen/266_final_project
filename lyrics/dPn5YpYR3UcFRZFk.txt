What were you doing in my dream last night, honey?
Well, I thought I locked that door up tight, baby
Well, it's a mystery to me
How you keep on slippin' in my mind
And it's downright dirty that this ol' wound
Won't heal with time

Well, you could wash my brain (wash my brain)
You could tear out my heart
But I would never forget you (ever)
You could change my name (change my name)
I could make a new start
But I would never forget you (ever)

And it's kill, kill, killin' me
It's kill, kill, kill, kill, killin' me
That I'm still in love with you

Just when I think I've got you in safe keeping
That's when your memory, it comes round creepin'
Well, it's an ache I can't shake
It's creeped down deep down to my core
But, baby, I can't fake it
I can't take this heartbreak anymore

Well, you could wash my brain (wash my brain)
You could tear out my heart
But I would never forget you (ever)
You could change my name (change my name)
I could make a new start
But I would never forget you (ever)

And it's kill, kill, killin' me
It's kill, kill, killin' me
That I'm still in love with you

(It's killin' me)

I asked you please to leave my heart
But you refused to go
I can't take this pain much longer
You insist on teaching me what I already know
Absence made this heart grow fonder

Well, you could wash my brain (wash my brain)
You could tear out my heart
But I would never forget you (ever)
You could change my name (change my name)
I could make a new start
But I would never forget you (ever)

And it's kill, kill, killin' me
It's kill, kill, kill, killin' me
That I'm still in love with you
