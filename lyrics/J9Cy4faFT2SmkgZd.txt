Will we close our eyes
Will we fall for those lies
Or will we make the conclusion
That this life's a delusion

Will we do what we're told
'til the day that we're sold
Or will we raise our voices
Make alternative choices

What's up

Our silence is death
We shall resist the violence
And we'll never give up
Only death is silence

Are we victims or winners
Believers or sinners
Do we sit in the saddle
Or are we just cattle

Are we wretched or bold
Are we garbage or gold
Can we make the right call
Can we change it at all

Acceptance is surrender
Vile and vicious slander
We don't want to be ruled
By a handful of fools
