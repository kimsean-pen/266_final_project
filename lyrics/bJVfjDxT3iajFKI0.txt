I walk into
Somebody else's house
I turn right 'round
And I'm quickly losing ground

And I poke myself in the eye
Just to check my vision
I hear, I see
I know what you've done to me

I'm losing sight
I question my current plight
And I polled myself
The results were inconclusive

I run I hide
Commit social suicide
I take a page
I openly plagiarize

And I back myself into a corner
And I'm not turning 'round
I wait my turn
I wait for the line to get long

I hit, I miss
I'm always aware of the risk
And I talk myself into
Repeating patterns

I run into the forest
I'm tripping over branches
I'm looking over my shoulder
Chase me, chase me, catch me
Pulling in six figures
Sticking up two fingers

I wait my turn
I wait for the line to get long
I hit, I miss
I'm always aware of the risk
And I talk myself into
Repeating patterns
