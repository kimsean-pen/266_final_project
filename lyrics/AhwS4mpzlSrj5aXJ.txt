And I fall
Into your open arms
Soundly embraced here
When I fail
Fall into your open arms
Soundly embraced here
When I'm lost

Plot threads for a patchwork quilt
I've been searching for...
Presence in a wandering heart
Kept like secrets
Forces bind us with no exception
In my absence I have not...
Forgotten
The shadows we create

And I fall
Into your open arms
Soundly embraced here
When I fail
Fall into your open arms
Soundly embraced here
When I'm lost

Fall into those arms again
Fall into those arms again
And there you are always
And there you are always

After all this time when I'm my most lost
An anchor, eternally grounding me to navigate
A darkness until a light so blinding burns through the fog
It's never in doubt

After all this time when the rain comes down
An anchor, eternally grounding me to navigate
What's left behind, what lies ahead
It can take the worst to find out

But there you are always
But there you are always
But there you are always
But there you are always
