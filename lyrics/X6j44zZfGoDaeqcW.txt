It's all the hereafter
We're coming for your guards
Descending the city,
A blanket of skulls
From out of the darkness -
The beauty and form
The hush of the idle
The sound of the bombs

You never will see us
Coming of going
We'll come over but don't stay
We're tearing up your yard
And when we're leaving...
Yeah, when we go...
You'll be dating a doctor or
Coming in Cold

It's all entertaining
We're coming after dark
One after the other
Cut it and scatter
Cut and Scatter
