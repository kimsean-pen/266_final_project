These don't have a name
I've been a fool to let it out that way
And it'll keep on coming back
A fool gets laughed at
and I'll go on and on and on
Letting it out when the feeling's strong
I wonder who in the single thing
Made this night and this ugly dreams
These all pass away
It is clear that one can see through a day
And i may have met my match
Completely unattached
with no one no one no one
on whom to rely
Let's sing that song
well I didn't read the last page
You thought of me at that final stage
eenie meenie miny moe
It's about time
About time to go
