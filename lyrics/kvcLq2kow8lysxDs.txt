I'm pulling down questions from the shelf -- I'm asking forgiveness.
I ain't asking nobody but myself, and I want you to know this.
I want you to know this.

You're rifling through a box of toys that were handed down to me.
Just take out the ones you brought, and then give the rest to my family.

I'm gonna go back to school today, but I'm dropping myself off.
I'm throwing the childhood seat away, I'm through ripping myself off.
I'm done ripping myself off.

I'm child then man and child again, the toy broken boy soldier.
I'm child then man then child again, the boy never gets older.
The boy never gets older, the boy never gets older.
The boy never gets older, the boy never gets older.
Never gets older, the boy broken toy soldier.
The boy... the boy!
