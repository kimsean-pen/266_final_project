You can't keep me standing here
your run away
And baby, it's just how it's gonna be
Take your time and turn around
Can't you see I've run aground
I think I've seen all that I can see

Everything you do I see for me this time
It's up to you to be with me this time
I feel for you
I feel for you

Is this how it's gonna be
Longer lasting you and me
Baby I'm just tired of this place
Can't you see it's so unfair
Touch me like you never care
I think that I'm so tired that I can't pray

Everything you do I see for me this time
It's up to you to be with me this time
I feel for you
I feel for you

Everything you do I see for me this time
It's up to you to be with me this time
I feel for you
I feel for you

Everything you do I see for me this time
It's up to you to be with me this time
I feel for you
I feel for you
