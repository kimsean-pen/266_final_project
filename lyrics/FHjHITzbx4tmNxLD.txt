She's been up all night
Cause she's been feeling kind of lonely
And she's been trying to find
Oh someone to go out with

Well it's her birthday
On a Tortellini Tuesday
Oh and you could be the one
Who makes her smile
And you know it

Give it just a minute or two
And I come by
And I come by, baby
No matter what I think about you
I've been lonely
You've been lonely, too
Oh yeah

She's been taking a break
From the life she's been living
Well I always see you hustling around
Oh baby don't be so down

Cause it's her birthday
On a Tortellini Tuesday
Oh and you could be the one
Who makes her smile
And you know it

Give it just a minute or two
And I come back
And I come back, baby
No matter what they think about you
I've been lonely
You've been lonely, too

Give it just a minute or two
And I come back
And I come back, baby
No matter what they think about you
I've been lonely
You've been lonely, too

Give it just a minute or two
And I come back
And come back, baby
No matter what they think about you
I've been lonely
You've been lonely, too
Oh yeah
