You keep dancing around
What you want so bad
Please concentrate, hear me out
You might get caught but if you want
You can keep your fingers crossed

We're outside and free from all tethers
So get off the floor if you're under the weather
C'mon
The Latchkey kids have all come together
So unlock the door, it'll make you feel better
C'mon

We've been sneaking around
But we do it lightly
No more middle school tongues
If you show up unarmed
Be still our beating hearts

We're outside and free from all tethers
So get off the floor if you're under the weather
What's in store is not so unusual
The latchkey kids have all come together
So unlock the door, it'll make you feel better
If it's not flesh and blood that leads you on honey
Then unlock the door
Unlock the door and move on

Be still, our beating hearts
Keep your fingers crossed

You keep dancing around
What you want so bad, bad

We're outside and free from all tethers
So get off the floor if you're under the weather
What's in store is not so unusual
The latchkey kids have all come together
So unlock the door, it'll make you feel better
If it's not flesh and blood that leads you on honey
Then unlock the door and move on

So get off the floor if you're under the weather
And unlock the door
