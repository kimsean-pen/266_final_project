I've got something to get off my chest
I've got a person that scares me to death
First name is Dick and you know the rest
Well I've got something I just got to say
This vice president will make us pay
We're inching closer to judgment day

My name is Cheney I got no remorse
(run run run Cheney's got a gun)
I get my way or I get to use force on anyone
You know he's evil, he's not of this race
(run run run Cheney's having fun)
He used a shotgun to blow off a face
He's still not done

Dick Cheney Son of Satan
He is the Chosen One

He's starting wars at the drop of a hat
(run run run Cheney's having fun)
He says he's certain he's driving them back
Were almost done
Let's have another let's fuck with Iran
(run run run Cheney's having fun)

It pleases Satan
When there's blood on the hands
Of his Number One

Dick Cheney Son of Satan
He is the Chosen One

The smell of money keeps him alive
(run run run Cheney's having fun)
He thinks it's funny when the bodies arrive
What's done is done

The occupation of Satan is near
(run run run Cheney's having fun)
Now Revelations is oh so near
For everyone

Dick Cheney Son of Satan
He is the chosen one
