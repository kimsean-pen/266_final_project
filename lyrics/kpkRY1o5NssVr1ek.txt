Tuggin' on my pinky ring, smelling like chrysanthemum
I just want that, I just want that bump, bump in my trunk
Blowin' skunk, gettin' crunk with my baby, oh, what's up?
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump in my trunk

We gon' ride, ride, ride down to Mexico
You can see the bad man, I'll come to New York
You can't catch him though
You can see the bad man, I'll come to New York
You can't catch him though
We gon' ride white lines all the way to Mexico
Merlyn! Merlyn!

And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live (ahhhh!)

I've been trappin' out my momma house, dope boy
Money keep the water and the lights on, spray it like it's Lysol
Your bitch don't like the dark so we fuckin' with the lights on
I fuck her with my chains on, you the one I changed on
I just won the ghetto lottery, I guess I'm hood rich
Chillin' at the Gallo, smokin' Blacks with my hood bitch
You ain't what you could be, come get on this dope dick
I sell it by the gram, now tell me who you fuck with

And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live (ahhhh!)

Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me operate
I ain't here to talk now, nigga, we ain't gonna conversate
This modern terrorism, you can't moderate
I've been fiendin' time to put these demons on display
'Cause they don't understand, I don't give a damn
Smoke some shit straight outta Alice in Wonderland
BROCKHAMPTON the clan, bitch, I ain't your man
Like they're stacking just to crumble like an avalanche
This is how it stand, this is how it is
Bitch, I ain't your friend, I ain't havin' kids
'Cause I know that if I'm gon' bring 'em in the world
My little spawns of Satan just might take off with your fuckin' girl

Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump, bump, bump
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump in my trunk
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump, bump, bump
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump in my trunk

And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
