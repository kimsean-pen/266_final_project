I know it's been a while since we last spoke
I hope you're doing fine out there on your own
Never thought we'd grow apart, we were together from the start
Scraping knees, collecting scars, now I don't know who you are

It's not our fault
It's the way things are
But I want you to know
You're still in my heart

We got caught in the storm alone
People come and people go
Drifting away like old friends do
But if you walk through the door
Our world would be just like it was before
Rewind the good times like old friends do

We've just been caught in the storm
Caught in the storm

I still look back on the days where we'd sneak out of the house
Finding a place to get away where we could drink and be ourselves
Now we're stressed out and held down to the life that we've made out
But those times have shaped us into who we wanted to be

We got caught in the storm alone
People come and people go
Drifting away like old friends do
But if you walk through the door
Our world would be just like it was before
Rewind the good times like old friends do

The past runs away from us
Memories fade in and out
Time flies by before we can even blink an eye

The past runs away from us
Memories fade in and out
Time flies by before we can even blink an eye

We got caught in the storm alone
People come and people go
Drifting away like old friends do
But if you walk through the door
Our world would be just like it was before
Rewind the good times like old friends do

We've just been caught in the storm
