I'm just sitting here, up against this oak tree
Just watching the day roam by
I've done the rat race, I played my last days
I just wanna sit here, in this place

With the sun on my face, yeah sun on my face
Won't you shine a little sun on my face

Now way up north the winter come and the winter blows
But down here it's always summertime
And I don't think, I'm gonna have to move again
Stay right here, with my very best friend

Yeah the sun on my face, oh the sun on my face
Won't you shine a little sun on my face
Yeah the sun on my face, oh the sun on my face
Won't you shine

I've loved womens and womens have loved me
But all the fame has passed
The years a-come and gone, and maybe I've just found
My own little piece of heaven in land

Yeah the sun on my face, oh the sun on my face
Won't you shine a little sun on my face
Yeah the sun on my face, oh the sun on my face
Won't you shine
Yeah the sun on my face, oh the sun on my face
Won't you shine a little sun on my face
