He said "I'll protect you like you are the crown jewels", yeah
Said he's feeling sorrier for me the more I behave badly I can bet

Hey Lloyd, I'm ready to be heartbroken
'Cause I can't see further than my own nose at this moment

Jealousy is more than a word, now I understand
You can't stay a girl while holding a boy's hand

Hey Lloyd, I'm ready to be heartbroken
'Cause I can't see further than my own nose at this moment
Hey Lloyd, I'm ready to be heartbroken
'Cause I can't see further than my own nose at this moment, at this moment

I've got my life of complication here to sort out
I'll take myself to an east coast city and walk about

Hey Lloyd, I'm ready to be heartbroken
'Cause I can't see further than my own nose at this moment
Hey Lloyd, I'm ready to be heartbroken
'Cause I can't see further than my own nose at this moment
Hey Lloyd, I'm ready to be heartbroken
'Cause I can't see further than my own nose at this moment, at this moment
