When the night is dark and lonely
And you got no place to go
From your eyes tears are falling
The other side is calling I'm the one who's left alone
Still remember when you told me
You'd never leave me on my own
Where are the ones I used to know
Mountains falling all around me
Deep blue oceans overflows
The ground is shaking underneath me
A spinning world without control
Little sun keep on shining
Though its hard you have to know
When the dark creeps up behind you Is when you really have to glow
