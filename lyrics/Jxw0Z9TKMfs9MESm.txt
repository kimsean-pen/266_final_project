I'm in a hurry to get things done
Ohh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
Even I'm in a hurry and don't know why?

Don't know why? I have to drive so fast
My car has nothing to prove
It's not new
But it'll do zero to sixty in five point two

I'm in a hurry to get things done
Ohh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why?

Can't be late, I leave in plenty of time
Shakin' hands with the clock
I can't stop
I'm on a roll and I'm ready to rock

Ohh I'm in a hurry to get things done
Ohh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
(All I got)
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why?

Ohh, I hear a voice
That says I'm running behind
I better pick up my pace
It's a race and there ain't
No room for someone in second place

Tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu...
Tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu...

I'm in a hurry to get things done
I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why?

I'm in a hurry to get things done
(I don't know why)
Ohh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
(All I got)
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why?

I'm in a hurry to get things done
Ohh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
(All I got)
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why?

I'm in a hurry to get things done
Ohh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why?
