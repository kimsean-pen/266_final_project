You're not asking for much, but
It just seems like a lot and
Kinda confused, don't know what to choose, but baby
It's hard for me
I'm not ready for your love

I keep up my guard, but
I don't mean to tease ya
You're down on your knees
You're begging me please, but darling
It's not the way
To get me babe, you know

Whoops didn't mean to make you love me
Whoops didn't mean to make you love me
Didn't mean to be charming
Such a beautiful darling
Didn't wanna make you think
We could be a thing
And I give you everything, love

Love feels like loneliness
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
That's just the way it is
Love feels like loneliness sometimes

We can't get the timing
Because I was running
But now I want you
And you always knew, so baby
You pull away
And make me wait for you

So screw all that love-ish
I think that I've had it
The more you turn your back
Then I want you back
'Cause this is the last time
I'll play this game
Always the same, and I'm through

Whoops didn't mean to make you love me
Whoops didn't mean to make you love me
Didn't mean to be charming
Such a beautiful darling
Didn't wanna make you think
We could be a thing
And I give you everything, love

Love feels like loneliness
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
That's just the way it is
Love feels like loneliness sometimes

Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes
Love feels (sometimes) like loneliness sometimes
Sometimes
'Cause love feels like loneliness sometimes

Love feels like loneliness (Sometimes)
And love feels like loneliness sometimes
That's just the way it is
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
(Sometimes, sometimes) No no no no no no no
(Sometimes, sometimes)
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
(Sometimes, sometimes)
(Sometimes, sometimes)
Love feels like loneliness sometimes
