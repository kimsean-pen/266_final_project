Time has come to go
Pack your bags, hit the open road
Our hearts just won't die
It's the trip, keeps us alive

So many miles
So many miles
So many miles
Away

They're following some dance of light
Tearing into the night
Watching you fall asleep
The sweetest dove in a dream

So many miles
So many miles
So many miles
Away
