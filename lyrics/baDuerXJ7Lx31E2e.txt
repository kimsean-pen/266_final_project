Another day I awake unable to escape
Another day I awake my life is losing shape
Will I get through this on my own
Or will they etch my name in stone

Another day I awake crowded and alone
Another day I awake full house but empty home
Will I get through this on my own
Or will they etch my name in stone

(We are) We are undead and unwanted
(We are) We are the shadows, the taunted
(We are) We are the ghosts and the haunted
Will we live through the night
Will we live through the night

Another day I awake I can't change my past
Another day I awake and it could be my last
Will I get through this on my own
Or will they etch my name in stone

They say don't listen to the voices, I tried, I can't, believe me
They say don't let it get you down like its so goddamn easy

(We are) We are undead and unwanted
(We are) We are the shadows, the taunted
(We are) We are the ghosts and the haunted
Will we live through the night
Will we live through the night

The night is getting darker
I don't wanna lay down
The night is getting darker
I don't wanna wake up

I feel the ground shake beneath me
Walls are crumbling I can't hide
It's time I faced these demons
It's time I rebuild from inside

(We are) We are undead and unwanted
(We are) We are the shadows, the taunted
(We are) We are the ghosts and the haunted
Will we live through the night
Will we live through the night
