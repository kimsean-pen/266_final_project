I don't wanna be polite,
I just wanna hold you tight and
Squeeze the truth
Out of you.
Before you walk away,
Let me remind you, Ray, that
You're amazing,
You just have no clue, so shy.
Stop running away.

'Cause the best is yet to come,
You will never be like the other ones.
Your life has just begun,
You don't have to hide where you're coming from.

Stand up and stretch out your arms,
This life won't do you no harm 'cause
I'm the one
You can always count on.
Before you walk away,
Let me remind you, Ray, that
I will be your friend
Until the bitter end.
Don't hide, don't throw this away.

'Cause the best is yet to come,
You will never be like the other ones.
Your life has just begun,
You don't have to hide where you're coming from.

But it's just another day,
And you don't have to wait
For the rain to wash away
Your dusty frame of mind.
And it's just another way,
You have to play that game:
Don't fall behind.

The best is yet to come,
You will never be like the other ones.
Your life has just begun,
You don't have to hide where you're coming from.

You are not alone:
Don't be scared,
Don't you dare give up, ooh.
You are not alone,
I'll be there.
