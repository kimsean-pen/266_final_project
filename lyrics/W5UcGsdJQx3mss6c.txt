On the edge of something real
I have a choice, but I don't know what to feel
Getting tired of all this fear
Before I choose, let me know that you'll be here
Let me know that you'll be here

Cause I'm not afraid to fall
If you're the one who catches me
Tell me that you'll be there when I'm
About to lose it all
Cause you're the one who helps me see
That sometimes it's ok to fall

When I'm far away from where you are
It's ok, cause we're under the same stars
I'm laying down this heavy load
Maybe now I can finally let this go
I can finally let you know

But I'm not afraid to fall
If you're the one who catches me
Tell me that you'll be there when I'm
About to lose it all
Cause you're the one who helps me see
That sometimes it's ok

To fall Oh Oh
To fall Oh Oh
To fall Oh oh
To fall
To fall Oh Oh
To fall Oh Oh
To fall Oh Oh
To fall

Not afraid to fall
If you're the one who catches me
Tell me that you'll be there when I'm
About to lose it all
Cause you're the one who helps me see
That sometimes it's ok to fall

Oh Oh Oh (Cause I'm not afraid to fall)
Fall Oh Oh Oh (if you're the one who catches me)
Sometimes it's ok to fall

When I'm about to lose it all
You're the one who helps me see
That sometimes it's ok
It will be okay
Sometimes it's ok, to fall

I'm gonna fall
