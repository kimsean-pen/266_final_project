Yess
What it look like Alc
Tryin' to show the niggas man
It's that Street Fam man, we rep that
Loso
Street fi-di-di-di-dam yes
I'm with 101 niggas, we dalmatian doggy deep (yess)
And fly with the tongue
So if you feeling froggy leap (come on)
Kermit, you better think before you ribbit
Don't get murdered over your song, before you ad-lib it
I pop up like Xzibit, but given I'm at your crib it's
Not to put no fucking fish tanks in your Civic
Fuck getting your ride pimped, you'll get hog-tied wimp
Have you in the trunk curled up like fried shrimp
It's been a good year, maybe I should ride blimp
Cause your boy just stay above the game
They trying to tag him, spray a brother frame
But your shots can't reach me, I'm way above your aim
Go 'head nigga, say another name
Take this family for a joke, play them Wayan brother games
And I'ma Git You Sucka, I be schemin' with this Keenan
Aimin with this Damon, I'm putting that Major Payne in
My Little Man is on ya, Marlon and Shawn ya
Lay the beef on his noodle, make some Luger lasagna
Forty Cal fettuccine, trey pound pasta
You reach for this medallion, you must like Italian nigga
You only see me pushing if the driver's tired
I work the S6 ever since the 5 retired
The drop top, they say it's Ocean Drive inspired
So you can call a cab once your bitch fall for Fab

Uhh, I get money like a muhfucker
Shades darker than a bitch, but I can see
I got everything, you got nothing
But you ain't got nothing on me
Oww I'm gettin' money like a muhfucka
Yeeaah, money you ain't never see
Yeeaah, I got everything, you got nothing
But you ain't got nothing on me

I'm on the grind 'til the police come
With that pistol on my side boy, don't be dumb
Or, I let that semi twirl you
Now you can follow the drip
Cause one shot outta the clip'll jerry curl ya
Leave you sloppy like seconds
Obey me like peasants
Or get opened up like presents, please
My young boys wildin' for respect
Slit your throat have you smiling with your neck, say cheese
My dough's a bit longer, my flow is just slaughter
My wrist look like frozen Poland Spring water
So tell me boys, tell me boys, who you think you messin' with
I get money out the ass, that's some expensive shit
Haven't you all heard
Y'all all herbs
I stick toothpicks in y'all hors d'oeuvres
I'm a shark y'all just koi fish
Octopus, oysters
Chump, I got my eye on your wifey now
I have her lick me up and then wipe me down
She told me you's a nag, you's a bug
She told me I'm a blast, I'm a stud
She told me you be beastin', you be checkin' for the burns
So I gave her knee pads for the rug
It's skull gang from the chain to the lifestyle
You surfboard dudes get wiped out, totally

Uhh, I get money like a muhfucker
Shades darker than a bitch, but I can see
I got everything, you got nothing
But you ain't got nothing on me
Oww I'm gettin' money like a muhfucka
Yeeaah, money you ain't never see
Yeeaah, I got everything, you got nothing
But you ain't got nothing on me

Get you 3, forget you
Like the number after 1, I'mma get me 2
It's Weezy F U, now you gotta have a baby
My money don't folds nor bends, Mercedes
Maybach, grey-black
And I got a 44. and a 'K, like 8 stacks
Fuck your city and your town, I state facts
Take that, no better yet like Diddy, take that
Wait rats, I hate rats, I clean 'em out like Ajax
Got paper like a fax machine, asaneen
Damn I mean asinine, I'm dapper don
And after mine there will be nine, damn I mean there will be none
I will be one, of the greatest things you've ever felt, you've ever seen
Or heard, Car-ter, hov-er, y'all scared, not me
Not I, call me Young Popeye
Tell Bluto I'm a nuno, I bring RAL to your funeral
Damn I mean fun-er-ill, fun-er-ol
You say tomato, I say tomahto
You say get 'em, I say got 'em, yeah I got 'em
Man you better keep payin' me
Cause you don't want my problems
I be wildin' like Capital One
What is in your wallet
You fly, but what is it to pilot
Weezy I'm at the top, foot up in your bottom
Huh, damn I mean, foot up in your ass
I kick that shit
Now go'n put it in the trash

Uhh, I get money like a muhfucker
Shades darker than a bitch, but I can see
I got everything, you got nothing
But you ain't got nothing on me
Oww I'm gettin' money like a muhfucka
Yeeaah, money you ain't never see
Yeeaah, I got everything, you got nothing
But you ain't got nothing on me
