I'm too cool for my dress,
These shades don't leave my head
Everything you say is so irrelevant,
You follow and I lead,

You wanna be like me
But you're just to wanna be,
Love it or hate it
I can't help the way I am

Hope you don't misunderstand
But I'm too cool (too cool)
Yeah, I'm too cool to know you
Don't take it personal, don't get emotional

You know it's the truth, I'm too cool for you
You think your hot but I'm sorry you're not
Exactly who you think you are
Can't tell you what that you haven't got

When we walk into the room,
I'm too cool for you
You're lucky I'm so nice,

Even I'm surprised
You are still allowed to be in my crew
I'll show you how it's done if you wanna be someone
Just watch me and you'll learn some

Me, myself and I agree
You'll never catch up with me
'Cause I'm too cool (too cool)
Yeah, I'm too cool to know you

Don't take it personal, don't get emotional
You know it's the truth, I'm too cool for you
You think your hot but I'm sorry you're not
Exactly who you think you are

Can't tell you what that you haven't got
When we walk into the room,
I'm too cool for you
You see some are born with beauty, brains and talent, and they got it all

While others have to try all their lives
Still they never get the call
That's the difference between you and me
Obviously!

I'm a natural, I'm the real deal
I can't help the way I am
Hope you don't misunderstand
But I'm too cool (too cool)
Yeah, I'm too cool to know you
Don't take it personal, don't get emotional
You know it's the truth I'm too cool for you
(Too cool, too cool)
Yeah, I'm too cool to know you
Don't take it personal, don't get emotional
You know it's the truth
I'm too cool for you
