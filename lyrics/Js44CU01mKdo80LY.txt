I remember flashbacks lighting up magic whip
Eight o'clock, Kowloon emptiness, handle it
The white horse image I had of you eleven seconds ago
I didn't send you, so you will never know

I got away for a little while
But then it came back
Much harder

Swinging on a cable up to Po Lin
Climbing down the ghostly wire in a battery
That light in your eyes
I search for religiously
When it's not there
Oh Lord it's hurting me

I got away for a little while
But then it came back
Much harder

Till I ever hold you out there again
Will you be mine?
Cause I'm on a ghost ship drowning my heart
In Hong Kong

It's the last ride boarding here tonight
Out in the bay (Out in the bay)
I'll need a lantern in you
To shine out bright rays

Feeling out of body here, what can I do?
It's up to the top every day to join with you

I had to get away for a little while
But then it came back
Much harder

Till I ever hold you out there again
Will you be mine?
Cause I'm on a ghost ship drowning my heart
In Hong Kong

It's the last ride boarding here tonight
Out in the bay (Out in the bay)
I'll need a lantern in you
To shine out bright rays

Till I ever hold you out there again
Will you be mine? (Will you be mine?)
Cause I'm on a ghost ship drowning my heart
In Hong Kong

It's the last ride boarding here tonight
Out in the bay (Out in the bay)
I'll need a lantern in you
To shine out bright rays
Bright rays
Bright rays
