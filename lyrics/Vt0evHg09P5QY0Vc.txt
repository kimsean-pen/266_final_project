Without a word uttered, a comparison is drawn
A distant future, a cluttered past amid the stars
Vague and persistent, though lacking consistency
Unwilling victim of farce

The loudest voices scream uninspired
Their numbers vast
Their spirits strong
Quiet choices sing against the choir
The majority is almost never wrong
Never wrong

A laughable assertion that there might be some connection
(Smoke filled halls)
Adorn the walls with mirrors and misdirection or let it go

No common thread
No ties that bind
Just grasping and clawing to keep in mind
Historical analysis they play a separate role
But one contributes more to the whole

Like a saucer sep let's separate
Let's separate
And shuffle off this conflict
My armament will suffocate
Will suffocate
And leave you feeling useless

We are your beginning
And we will be your end
Affluence permitting a mutual annihilation

A laughable assertion that there might be some connection
(Smoke filled halls)
Adorn the walls with mirrors and misdirection or let it go

Discussion moot
Arguments tended
Aggressive mutes
Stumbling defended
Fiction versus fantasy where fact remains unclear
How you pretend both franchises stand only on one tier

We are your beginning
And we will be your end
Affluence permitting
a mutual annihilation

I don't care who shot first
Or for the song and dance you've rehearsed
(Mutual annihilation)
The maps are divided and each I've traversed
Alignment influx for better or worse
Is the drain finally swirling or are we swirling the drain
This drought is relieved with acid rain

This drought is relieved with acid rain

(We are)
We are your beginning (and the end)
And we will be your end (We will bring your end)

Affluence permitting a mutual annihilation
