When I close my eyes and think of you
And reminisce on all the things you do
I can't imagine my life without you
It's like paradise, now I
Know that it's real (um)
It's a mystery
For someone to give their life just for me
What you did on Calvary
Makes me wanna love you more

I never knew
I could be so happy
I never knew
I'd be so secure
Because of your love
Life has brand new meaning
It's gonna be a brighter day, brighter day

Never thought that I would smile again
I never thought the dark clouds would end
Never thought that I could have a friend
That would keep me never leave me alone
Jesus you're my everything
the only one that makes my heart sing (heart sing)
Now I know what real love means
It's everlasting, lasting

I never knew
I could be so happy
I never knew
I'd be so secure
Because of your love
Life has brand new meaning
It's gonna be a brighter day, brighter day

I never knew
I could be so happy
I never knew
I'd be so secure
Because of your love
Life has brand new meaning
It's gonna be a brighter day, brighter day

Nothing can compare
To the joy you bring
An everlasting love affair
Jesus my life would never be the same
I found someone who truly cares

I never knew
I could be so happy
I never knew
I'd be so secure
Because of your love
Life has brand new meaning
It's gonna be a brighter day, brighter day
brighter day, brigther day, brighter day, brighter day,
brighter day, brighter da, brighter day, brighter day ...
(25x)

I never knew
I could be so happy
I never knew
I'd be so secure
Because of your love
Life has brand new meaning
It's gonna be a brighter day, brighter day
