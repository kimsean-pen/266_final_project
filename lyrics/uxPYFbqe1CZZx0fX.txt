You saw it all fall apart,
you saw the person I was before and after the illness
Started pulling out my teeth,
And draining the colour from my cheeks
And I can't blame you for leaving me here

But I wish that you'd told me how it upset my mother
Seeing her son's condition fading daily, it must have been so hard
She's been through hell with me so far

Between depression and colitis, I lost half of my weight
She'd find me bleeding in the bathroom, too exhausted to shake
I was embarrassed to speak up
Because a man should be able to care for himself
I shouldn't need medication to make it through the day
