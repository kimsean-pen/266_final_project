Secret signs, I show them to my heart that shares my view
though it's old and all too sore, this heaven cannot hold it anymore
Two-faced eyes, there's nothing that can keep me from my prize
Glory days, though come and gone
And you'll be left to mourn what you have found

Come what may
Deed is done
Now we watch a setting sun
'Cause I want a life
With a view
Can't you see it's about you
And how I breathe for you

Speak your mind, 'cause my dear you don't even know how to lie
Charlatans all gathered now
They're here to watch us crumble from inside
Out of time, an end oh so fitting, can you hear the crowd?
For the very last time
Just show them how you swayed when you were mine

Come what may
Deed is done
Now we watch a setting sun
'Cause I want a life
With a view
Can't you see it's about you
And how I breathe for you

Come what may
Deed is done
Now we watch a setting sun
I want a life
With a view
Can't you see it's about you
And how I breathe
Come what may
Deed is done
Now we watch a setting sun
'Cause I want a life
With a view
Can't you see it's about you
And how I breathe
And how I dream of you
