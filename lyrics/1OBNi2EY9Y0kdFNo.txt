Life is longer in a path to me
I will set your soul free
Ooooh
Ahhhhh

I change shapes into a wolf or a man
It wasn't cool to bring back the war
Well, then really the war is on
Change shape he's worried
Rise on a hurry

He's the first Hawkshaw to die
Even when he was just a simple thief in the night
Slowly dug his own grave

Came from family, wealth, and the rich
It wasn't cool to bring back the war
Well, then really the war is on
Change shape he's worried
Rise on a hurry

He's the first Hawkshaw to die
It wasn't cool to bring back the war
Well, then really the war is on

Change shape he's worried
Rise on a hurry
He's the first Hawkshaw to die

It's my sh
Just keeping it back the way it's supposed be
It's ranson hours can only mean it's really here
Life is lost
They don't really know what is on
He's the first Hawkshaw
