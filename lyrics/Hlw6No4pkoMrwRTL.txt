In our covered wagon times when Dad he had his captain eyes
We'd get the steel horse moving on the straights and lines of 95
And Mom she was our singer and we kept alive on greasy fries
I held onto my stash of jams that ran along in Michelin time

In the back of, our old car never going too far
In the back of, our old car you've gone too far

And there's no way to remind me of specific plates or what the text was
No better way to remind me of sun-heated seats than "Love me do" was

Carolina mark the mile
"South of the Border" bumper signs
And styles I don't recognize
A weeping willow motel sign
By Georgia I am hypnotized
More batteries for my Powerman
I'm tuning into radio
Let it change me till we drive again

In the back of, our old car never going too far
In the back of, our old car you've gone too far

And there's no way to remind me of, the scented heads in a blue Camino
No better way to remind me of, a neato rack than a lead off track was
There's no way to remind me of, specific plates or what the text was
No better way to remind me of, sun-heated seats than "Love me do" was

And in the night time you'll sleep
Lean on it, lean on it
Don't you wake them lean on

And in the night time you'll sleep
Lean on it, lean on it
Don't you wake them lean on

And in the night you'll sleep
What!
