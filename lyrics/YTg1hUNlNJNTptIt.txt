Driving in the fast lane
Counting mile marker signs
The empty seat beside me
Keeps you on my mind

Livin' in the heartache
Was never something I pursued
I can't keep on chasing
What I can't be for you

Ooh skies are black and blue
I'm thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm

Tears on the highway
Water in my eyes
This rain ain't gonna change us
So what's the use to cry?

I could say I'm sorry
But I don't wanna lie
I just wanna know if staying
Is better than goodbye

Ooh skies are black and blue
I'm thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm

Ooh after all that we've been through
There ain't nothing new
Here in the calm after the storm

Maybe I can find you
Down this broken line
Maybe you can find me
Guess we'll know in time
Ooh skies are black and blue
I'm thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm
Ooh after all that we've been through
There ain't nothing new
Here in the calm after the storm
