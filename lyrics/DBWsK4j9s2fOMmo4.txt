Water travels by itself
Inspires us to fear the sea
When it affects our state of mind
We drown in our make believe

Those little drops that cover two thirds
Eventually there will be nothing left
But water, this water

It rules but even so
It tears apart around us
Throws itself high up in the sky
Never will be able to tame
