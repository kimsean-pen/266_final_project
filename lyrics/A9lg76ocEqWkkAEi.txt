The moment has come to face the truth
I'm wide awake, and so are you
Do you have a clue what this is? (I don't know)
Are you everything that I missed? (Don't hope so)
We'll just have to wait and see (Wait and see)
If things go right, we're meant to be

The surface is gone, we scratched it off
We made some plans and let them go
Do you have the slightest idea (No, I don't)
Why the world is right when you're near? (Oh, is that so?)
Stay a while and wait and see (Wait and see)
If things go right, we're meant to be

Oh, what a world this life would be
Forget all your technicolor dreams
Forget modern nature, this is how it's meant to be

The time is here for being straight
It's not too early and never too late
People say I should watch my pace (What do they know?)
Think how you spend all your days (They all say so)
They'll just have to wait and see (Wait and see)
If things go right, they'll have to agree

Oh, what a world this life would be
Forget all your technicolor dreams
Forget modern nature, this is how it's meant to be

Do-dum-dum, do-do-do-dum
Da-do-dum-dum, do-do-do-dum

Do you have the slightest idea (No, I don't)
Why the world is right when you're near? (Is that so?)
Stay a while, we'll wait and see (Wait and see)
If things go right, we're meant to be

Oh, what a world this life would be
Forget all your technicolor dreams
Forget modern nature, this is how it's meant to be
Forget modern nature, this is how it's meant to be
