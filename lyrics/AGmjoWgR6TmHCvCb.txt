I can't be to blame
For the reasons you're in pain
If you push I'll pull away
But in the moment when it's over
Don't hold on here's closure

I'll turn to something you won't like
Heartless tonight
And you'll hate me in time
I'm warning you now this is it

I tried to stop you, you can't resist
I tried to tell you, but you insist
You bring out the devil inside of me
And I can't help that I made you weak
Just because I can
Doesn't mean that I will
But I'm about to break you

I'm not the one you built up,
I'm not the dreams in your head
I will take what I want
And leave you tortured instead

Caught inside another trap I've set
I look distressed
But I'm pretending to care

I'll turn to something you won't like
Heartless tonight,
you'll hate me in time
I'm warning you now this is it

I tried to stop you, you can't resist
I tried to tell you, but you insist
You bring out the devil inside of me
And I can't help that I made you weak
Just because that I can
Doesn't mean that I will
But I'm about to break you

Hasn't always been this way
Been the prey but I escaped
Cross my heart and lick my scar
Play with me
Get ripped apart

I tried to stop you, you can't resist
I tried to tell you, but you insist
You bring out the devil inside of me
And I can't help that I made you weak
Just because that I can
Doesn't mean that I will

I tried to stop you, you can't resist
I tried to tell you, but you insist
You bring out the devil inside of me
And I can't help that I made you weak
Just because that I can
Doesn't mean that I will
But I'm about to break you
(I'll turn to something you won't like)
But I'm about to break you
