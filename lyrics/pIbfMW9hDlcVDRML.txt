It's not your face
Or the colour of your hair
Or the sound of your voice, my dear
That's got me dragged in here
It's the ice in the seam, the scheme of you
You're supposed to have the answer
You're supposed to have living proof

Yes I was jealous
Because you are sworn
How could you come undone to a word so strong?
My beating heart the anchor to a ship so warm
You're supposed to have the answer
You're supposed to have living proof
Well I am your answer, I am living

Will you terrorize this
With your perfect lips
I watch you eat and feed this mess
To the running wind
But I know you from before and after until then
Do you have your answer?
Do you have living proof?
Well I am your answer, I am living

You're supposed to have an answer
You're supposed to have living proof
Well, do you have your answer?
Do you have your answer?
Well I am your answer, I am living
