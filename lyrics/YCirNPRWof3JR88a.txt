So come one and come all to the crumbling walls of our city, now painted with red
As the stench of defeat emanates through the streets is the life we once dreamed of now dead?
But we won't break, we will fight, we will storm through the night -enslaved to their game nevermore
With the locks on our cage broken off by the rage now it's time to settle the score
We are the frayed, we are the torn
We are the beaten and the scorned
And now you've forced the beast to bare its teeth
We'll come in droves like animals
Hungry to reclaim our control
As we fight to bite the bitter hand that feeds
We are the frayed
Beyond the barricade oh can't you hear that sound?
The march of tortured souls screaming, "Burn this place to the ground"
The pack you played for fools, the herd you led astray
Now run the slaughterhouse, welcome to Judgment Day
You'll pay in blood as your retribution
So let's gather at the gallows for the execution
We are the frayed, we are the torn
We are the beaten and the scorned
And now you've forced the beast to bare its teeth
We'll come in droves like animals
Hungry to reclaim our control
As we fight to bite the bitter hand that feeds
We are the frayed
And when the new day dawns upon our master plan
Just hold your rifles still and then wait for my command
We'll kill like savages 'cause we're unbreakable
But what did you expect?
We're fucking animals
Though what good is it to find the same sad solution?
Another power hungry biased fucking institution
We took the fort, we stormed the gates
But what kind of crooked paradox did we create?
We took the fort, we stormed the gates
But became the very thing that we hate
We are the frayed, we are the torn
We are the beaten and the scorned
And now you've forced the beast to bare its teeth
We'll come in droves like animals
Hungry to reclaim our control
As we fight to bite the bitter hand that feeds
We are the frayed
We are the frayed
We are the frayed
We are the frayed
Where is the end? What have we done?
We're what we swore we'd not become
Despite intent a noble heart still bleeds
Time goes on and history repeats
