Snow coming down now
Like December, burning up in the summer rays
But I'm not stumbling like a pretender
Medicine flowing through my veins

Heavy eyes, but the tongue won't stutter
Mouths are moving and this heart's still fluttering
I'm on my own
You found me in the cold
Now I am wrapped within the warmth of your touch
There's never a moment that I let slip by in your eyes
Are we growing old
And am I melting in the rays of this love?
Never ever gonna let you go
Don't let go
(Never gonna let you go)

Slow it down now
I cannot remember why I let them chew on my brain
They've come and left this town
In smoldering embers
But, my dear, I'll die in your rain

Heavy eyes, but the tongue won't stutter
Mouths are moving and this heart's still fluttering
I'm on my own
You found me in the cold
Now I am wrapped within the warmth of your touch
There's never a moment that I let slip by in your eyes
Are we growing old
And am I melting in the rays of this love?
Never ever gonna let you go
Don't let go

Do you feel the love?
Yes, I feel the love
Taste it, hold it, feel it, never let it go
Do you feel the love?
Yes, I feel the love
Do you feel the love?
Yes, I feel the love
Taste it, hold it, feel it, never let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Don't let go
Don't let go
