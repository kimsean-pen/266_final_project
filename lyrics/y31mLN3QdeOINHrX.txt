Knew you'd be here tonight
So I put my best dress on
Boy I was so right

Our eyes connected
Now nothin's how it used to be
Don't second guess it

Trackin' on this feelin'
Pull focus close up you and me
Nobody's leavin'

Got me affected
Spun me one eighty degrees
So electric

Slow down and dance with me, yeah, slow
Skip a beat and move with my body, yeah, slow
Come on and dance with me, yeah, slow
Skip a beat and move with my body, yeah, slow

Don't wanna rush it
Let the rhythm pull you in
It's here so touch it

You know what I'm sayin'
And I haven't said a thin'
Keep the record playin'

Slow down and dance with me, yeah, slow
Skip a beat and move with my body, yeah, slow
Come on and dance with me, yeah, slow
Skip a beat and move with my body, yeah, slow

Oh, oh, read my body language
Take it down, down

Slow down and dance with me, yeah, slow
Skip a beat and move with my body, yeah, slow
Come on and dance with me, yeah, slow
(Slow down and dance with me)
Skip a beat and move with my body, yeah, slow
(Slow down and dance with me)

Skip a beat and move with my body
Skip a beat and move with my body
Skip a beat and move with my body
Slow
