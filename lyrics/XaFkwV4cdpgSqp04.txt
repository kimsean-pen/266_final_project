Oh won't you take it off my shoulders now?
Oh won't you take it off my shoulders now?
It's all in my head, in my head
It's all in my head
It's all in my head, is it?
(You've made your bed)
In my head, in my head, is it?
(You've made your bed)
In my head
It's all in my head
Late... late... I'm late again, I know
I always try to see you
Before I go
An ever-long road
Time and time was then
The ghouls ain't always friends
A silvery waterfall
And a screechy loud, carnivorous sound
Oh won't you take it off my shoulders now?
Oh won't you take it off my shoulders now?
It's all in my head, in my head
It's all in my head
It's all in my head, is it?
(How did they get ya through?)
In my head, in my head, is it?
(How did they get ya through?)
In my head
It's all in my head
