Weâ¬"ll be together
Cause I really want is you
Weâ¬"ll be forever
Cause I gotta stick with you
Iâ¬"m wearing leather
And I really think itâ¬"s cool
Weâ¬"ll do whatever
Cause you're gonna do, what you wanna do.

Hands, do you really wanna hold my dirty hands
Do you really wanna hold my dirty hands
Do you really wanna hold my dirty hands
Do you really wanna hold my dirty hands

Me and Bobby went to the beach this summer
We built castles in the sand, and smoked dope by the water.
Then I got a tattoo of a dolphin on my belly button
And Bobby got a tattoo that said panama city beats 3003

Whatever
Cause I really want is you
Weâ¬"ll be forever
Cause I gotta stick with you
Iâ¬"m wearing leather
And I really think itâ¬"s cool
Weâ¬"ll do whatever
Cause you're gonna do, what you wanna do.
