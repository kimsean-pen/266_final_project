And I felt so I, I, I'm in love
With you

How good it feels
To have your love

Forever and always

And I knew
That you were my only one

'Til I can make you
Make you my own

So you see
I really care
Without you, I'm nothin'
Oh, oh

Just one look
And I know
I'll get you someday
Oh-oh-whoa

I thought I was dreaming
But I was wrong, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, but I'm gonna keep on scheming
'Til I can make you
Make you my own

That's all it took, yeah
Just one look
That's all it took, yeah
