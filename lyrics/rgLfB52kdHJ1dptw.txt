Who am I? /
I'm just a girl / who only wants /
to try / to do what's right; /
I'll never make / you cry, /
but you're no good for me, and /
who do you think you are? /
You tried to push me a bit too far, /
and every day sees another scar. /
Oh tell me, who do you think you are? /
If you want me there, / you gotta care! /
Oh tell me, /

who do you think you are (who) /
taking advantage of me this way? /
Tell me, who do you think you are (who), /
hurting me more with the things you say? /
It's not fair, / you don't care. /
Who do you really think that you are? (who) /

Where are we? (oh where are we?) /
We're at the cross roads and /
I just / can't see (just can't see) /
which way to take / to keep you
here / with me (here with me). /
The lights are changing, baby, /
who do you think you are? /
You tried to push me a bit too far, /
and every day sees another scar. /
Oh tell me, who do you think you are? /
If you want me there, / you gotta care! /
Oh tell me, /

who do you think you are (who) /
taking advantage of me this way? /
Tell me, who do you think you are (who), /
hurting me more with the things you say? /
It's not fair, / you don't care. /
Who do you really think that you are? (who) /

If you want me there, / you gotta care! /
Oh tell me, /

who do you think you are (who) /
taking advantage of me this way? /
Tell me, who do you think you are (who), /
hurting me more with the things you say? /
It's not fair, / you don't care. /
Who do you really think that you are? (who)/

Who do you think you are (who) /
taking advantage of me this way? /
Tell me, who do you think you are (who), /
hurting me more with the things you say? /
It's not fair, / you don't care...
