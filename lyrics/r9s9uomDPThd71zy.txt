You tried to kill me off
Surprised, I remain
A scale tips, impossible
Afraid of my own name

And I always paid attention to all the lines you crossed
Forgive this imperfection it shows, and know
I am the child that lives and cries in the corner
Dies in the corner

Unloved inside your mind

Intent obsolescence
Built into the system
Intent obsolescence
Built into the system

Intent obsolescence
Built into the system
Intent obsolescence
Built into the system

Intent obsolescence
Built into the system
Intent obsolescence
Built into the system

I tried to shake it off
You can't remove this stain
A scale breaks, impossible
Afraid we are the same

And you never paid attention to all the lines I crossed
Forgive this imperfection it shows, and know
I am the child that lives and cries in the corner
Dies in the corner

Unloved inside your mind
Hides in a corner
Dies in a corner
Unloved inside your mind

Intent obsolescence
Built into the system
Intent obsolescence
Built into the system

Intent obsolescence
Built into the system
Intent obsolescence
Built into the system

Built into the system
