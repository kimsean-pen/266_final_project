The spring time brings a scent so sweet
A scent of life in times of need
The river flows and I will drown myself
The river flows and I will drown
From petals falling to the ground
From petals falling to the ground

The smoke rises, ash descends
We stoke the fire with trembling hands
The river flows and I will drown myself
The river flows and I will drown
In ashes falling to the ground
In ashes falling to the ground

And summer's passing
And we're waiting
Knowing death is drawing near
And in our valley
Of our torrent
There is nothing left but fear

And mist is rising from the field
A hazy breath that cuts like steel
The river flows and I will drown myself
The river flows and I will drown
In leafs and rain on stony ground
...and leafs are falling to the ground

We wander through the break of dawn
Remaining in silence despite all scorn
The river flows and we will drown ourselves
The river flows and we will drown
In snow that's falling to the ground
In snow that's falling to the ground
...and snow is falling to the ground
Tossed and torn without a sound
