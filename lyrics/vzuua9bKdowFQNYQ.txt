I'm searching for a whole new beginning
An endless void
This notion that I sense within me
You're still by my side

Oh, I feel your presence
You'll never leave here
But if I reach out there to hold you
Every part that's real disappears

As I become more present now
I can't see through the pain
A hollow cut through my veins
(the phantom takes his toll)

The days that just keep on coming
The stain that they leave
I wish I could break this casket
But I'm left here to grieve
In a world of my own design

As I become more present now
I can't see through the pain
A hollow cut through my veins
(the shadows takes their toll)
And did you leave me anything?
You're the phantom of my past...
Do you expect me to last, this way?
(a scar and a phantom pain)
