Just have a little patience
Still hurting from a love I lost
I'm feeling your frustration
But any minute all the pain will stop
Just hold me close inside your arms tonight
Don't be too hard on my emotions

'Cause I need time
My heart is numb, has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try and have a little patience
I really wanna start over again
I know you wanna be my salvation

The one that I can always depend
I'll try to be strong, believe me
I'm trying to move on
It's complicated but understand me

'Cause I need time
My heart is numb, has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try and have a little patience, yeah
Have a little patience, yeah

'Cause these scars run so deep
It's been hard
But I have to believe

Have a little patience
Have a little patience
Woah, 'cause I, I just need time
My heart is numb, has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try, and have a little patience
Have a little patience
My heart is numb, has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try and have a little patience
