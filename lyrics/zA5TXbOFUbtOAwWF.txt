Kinda like a dog with seven pupils in its eye
kinda like a madness that refuses to subside
kinda like everything you want, just within your grasp
kinda like how a banshee-wail dances on a living heart
I'm gonna stand at the top of the world
and challenge the heavens
gonna bring you god
gonna bring you god
in the palm of the left hand black
gonna bring you god

Kinda like when the sun goes down and darkness makes its climb
kinda like all your muscle tissue starting to unwind
kinda like if you brave the hate, feed it to the left hand black
how i know i can take their power, send it back at triple times its strength
yea
I'm gonna stand at the top of the world
and challenge the heavens
gonna bring you god
gonna bring you god
in the palm of the left hand black, yea
gonna bring you god

How i see the battle and the bleeding human race
how i miss the taste of it, its sweet and warm embrace
how i see the world's demise, its last and final gasp
how i see reality explode into another kind of life, well
I'm gonna stand at the top of the world
and challenge the heavens
gonna bring you god
gonna bring you god
in the palm of the left hand black, yea
gonna bring you god
Gonna bring you god
gonna bring you god
in the palm of the left hand black, yea
gonna bring you god
