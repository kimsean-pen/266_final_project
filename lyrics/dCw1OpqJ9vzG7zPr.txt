Oh no,
Olympia said she loves me, Olympia said she needs me,
But what about all the marquis,
No not them,
Because they're all so autocratic,

There's something pale underneath the beat,
A white innocence marked by lecherous men,
I thought I'd suffer in the city heat,
I thought I'd suffer now lets hope to begin again,

If they could see,
Modern Venus,
Tender and frail,
Hell she's nervous,
But she's the best in all of Paris,
At aching and breaking hearts,

And oh lord,
Is heaven such a fine thing,
We're floating in a dead town,
Hoping to find someone to be near,
And we'll fly away,
Holding onto something,
We're drifting in a dull sound,
Hoping to find someone who will hear,

Oh no,
Olympia said she loves me,
Olympia said she needs me,
But what about all the marquis,
No not them,
Because they're all so autocratic,

I can't invest with this currency,
A blind diligence wrapped and bowed with a lie,
But still we stay for the company,
But still we stay cause we don't wanna ever die,

If they could see,
Modern Venus,
Tender and frail,
Hell she's nervous,
But she's the best in all of Paris,
At aching and breaking hearts,

And oh lord,
Is heaven such a fine thing,
We're floating in a dead town,
Hoping to find someone near,
And we'll fly away,
Holding onto something,
We're drifting in a dull sound,
Hoping to find someone who will hear,
