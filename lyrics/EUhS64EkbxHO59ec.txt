You said hello, you passed me
You said your heart was lost
You left your world exposed, long gone
You left your voice inside

And you're far away
She's got it
And you're far away
She's far
And now all the thoughts
Forgotten
And now all the hope
Is gone

You said no words as you walked past
You said you were alright
You left your world exposed, long gone
You left your voice inside

And you're far away
She's got it
And you're far away
She's far
And now all the thoghts
Forgotten
And now all the hope
Is gone
