all is lost

the sky is void
all that would exist in time is destroyed

alight the funeral pyre
dredge up the tombs set the souls afire

homage to the playground of the dead
churning in agony under the land we tread

we await the departure
between the flesh and soul
to worlds below

the sky is void
all that would exist in time is destroyed
evolve and perish
the great reset
eradication is true progress

signals in the distance
dying with the faintest glow
instincts of nature
swallowed by the undertow

black tides
engulf the districts with salt and sand
shrouded in blackness
entomb the land
coffin dragger
inhale the earth
coffin dragger
inhale the earth

reap
songs of man
born in ancestral suffering
the departure is imminent
the coming of end times
is swift and unyielding

spiralling forever
return to the locusts
return to the ether

all is lost
all is always lost

the sky is void
all that would exist in time is destroyed
evolve and perish
the great reset
eradication is true progress
