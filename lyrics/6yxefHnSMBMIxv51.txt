Just the other day, the other day
I was talking to the weather man about today, oh, oh, oh
And all, all he could say
Was no one knows tomorrow

See I can read the weather, child
I can say maybe the rain will fall, the sun will shine, oh, oh, oh
But that's as far as my guess goes
'Cause no one knows tomorrow
Oh, oh, ha, no one knows tomorrow

Tell me what's the need to go to war
All the killings just to settle some one else's score, oh, oh
When the victory isn't even sure, oh, oh, oh
No one knows tomorrow

See we can study history
And philosophy and Plato's ideology, oh, oh, oh
But tomorrows still a mystery
No one knows tomorrow, oh, oh, ha

No one knows tomorrow, oh
No one knows tomorrow, oh, oh, ha
No one knows tomorrow, oh, ha

Tomorrow is your opportunity to fail
Or be successful if you please, yes indeed
Tomorrow is a politician's today
It's the victim of decision and the future of our children

So when I die someday will I be in heavenly places
Singing hallelujah with an angel on the piano?
Or will I be just another contribution
To the earth, the tress, the grasses as tomorrow slowly passes?

No one knows, no one knows
No one knows, no one knows
No one knows, no one knows
So when I die someday will I be in heavenly places
Singing hallelujah with an angel on the piano?
Or will I be just another contribution
To the earth, the tress, the grasses as tomorrow slowly passes?
No one knows, no one knows
No one knows, no one knows
