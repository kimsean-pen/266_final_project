there's no competing with him
I can't keep you warm like that
I can't love you the way he does
I can only love you more

there's no convincing me
that you'll still talk to me like you did
I can't bear to see you like this
it makes me love you more

and more than anything ever
you're beautiful and always so clever
you're everything good, I hope that I might be
I hope he sees even half of what I see

there's nothing keeping you with me
you can go away with him
there's no sense in rubbing it in
it makes me love you more

I can't compete with that boy
I can't make you feel like that
I can't love you the way he does
I can only love you more

and more each time you ignore me
this jealousy is starting to bore me
you can have him and I'll have my own
or maybe I'd just rather end up alone
