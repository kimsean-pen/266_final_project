sorry
but i don't understand
the things you say
they make no sense at all
funny
but i think that you mean them all
this time

don't you
i know that you think i'm a fool
but couldn't you try
to forgive a fool
one more time

sorry
but i'm not really listening
i've got my mind
on something else
and sometimes i wonder if i'm here
if i'm here at all

i know that you want me to go
don't you
but it's not as easy as it seems
i know that you think i'm not here at all
but i'm just as fed up as you

i know that you want me to leave
i'm amazed at how cold you can be
well may my weak and insipid soul grow stronger in your absence
