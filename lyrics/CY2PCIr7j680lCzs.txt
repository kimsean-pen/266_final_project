I am free, yeah, yeah
Come water me, oh, oh
Love you so, but if you don't
I have to leave, oh, no

Come water me, oh, oh
Love you so, but if you don't

It's hot, I think I wanna kick off both of my socks
I can feel it boilin' up in this pot
A closed mouth don't get fed, is you hungry or not?
Like brr brr, operator
Caboose like, choo choo, bless my trainer (Whoo)
Thank God, thank God, thank God, I'm gettin' thicker
And I got 'em sweatin' in the middle of the winter

(Get up) I don't get dehydrated, I moisturize it daily
I am my inspiration, I am my inspiration (Get up)
But I love you, no limit, I need to know you in it
If you got time, let's spend it, oh, yeah

I am free, yeah, yeah
Come water me, oh, oh
Love you so, but if you don't
I have to leave, oh, no
I am free, yeah, yeah
Come water me, oh, oh
Love you so, but if you don't
I have to leave, oh, no

Ooh, I think I need a washrag, perspiratin'
Gimme that sweet tea, you think I'm playin'
I need it all night, no sleep
You can get it in the kitchen if you sweatin' out the sheets
Like brr, brr, operator
You got me like, hee-hee, Mike Jackson (C'mon girl)
Thank God, thank God, thank God, I'm gettin' thicker
And I can make you boil up, baby, let it simmer

(Get up) I don't get dehydrated, I moisturize it daily
I am my inspiration, I am my inspiration (Get up)
But I love you, no limit, I need to know you in it
If you got time, let's spend it, oh, yeah

I am free, yeah, yeah
Come water me, oh, oh
Love you so, but if you don't
