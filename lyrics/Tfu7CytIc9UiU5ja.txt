Can I become a better person before the clock strikes twelve?
I wish I didn't fall in love with everyone I ever met
And I would never be sad again
If I could only live inside your head

I thought my life was gonna change
But this year, this year, this year I stayed painfully the same
I don't wanna talk about myself like that anymore
Can I just do it all over?

I can't keep ducking conversations
Before they all catch on
I wish I didn't give so much to anyone who ever asked
And I would never be sad again
If I could only live inside your head

I thought my life was gonna change
But this year, this year, this year I stayed painfully the same
I don't wanna talk about myself like that anymore
Can I just do it all over?

I'd never be sad again
If I could only live inside your head

I thought my life was gonna change
But this year, this year, this year I stayed painfully the same
I don't wanna talk about myself like that anymore
Can I just do it all over?
