Well, we always seem to worry
Life's becoming such a flurry
Can't you see that there's lights in the dark
Nothing's quite what it seems in the city of dreams

Rainbows tinted with gold
All the stories we've been told
Still her love is yours to behold
Nothing's quite what it seems in the city of dreams

You say it's not the real world
Though it seems so real to me
And I know that we're never turning back
Can you see what I see?

I had a vision
Of festive days
She's like an eagle
In the misted haze

Sit and wonder at the sky
Watch the river flowing by
Now it ends and we're here at the start
Nothing's quite what it seems in the city of dreams

You say it's not the real world
Though it seems so real to me
And I know that we're never turning back
Can you see what I see?

I had a vision
Of festive days
She's like an eagle
In the misted haze

Oh, break my chains, girl
Show me to the land
Where people live together
Try to understand
