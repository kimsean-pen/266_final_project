thousand miles
forgetting
anything
everything
wheels racing
black cloud gaining ground
engine roars
rain pours down
the chase is on
my black cloud
gaining ground
three years spent
outrunning
my demon
and her ring
keep moving
with engine heart
and boiled blood
i will push on down
my wounded roads
i can outrun
i will outrun you all
horsepower hope
find me a home
in brand new arms
that won't let go
racing on to my end
