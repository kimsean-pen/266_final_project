Here I am, take me
It's easier to give in
Some people mistake me
They only hear what they wanna hear

If you're losing sleep
Forgive me
I just can't keep pretending

I'm packin' my bags 'cause I don't wanna be
The only one who's drowning in their misery
And I'll take that chance, 'cuz I just wanna breathe
And I won't look back and wonder how it's supposed to be
How it's supposed to be

There's a prism by the window
That lets the light leak in
I wish you would let me
You feel the water, but do you swim?

And it's only me
Empty handed
With a childish grin
And a camera

I'm packin' my bags 'cause I don't wanna be
The only one who's drowning in their misery
And I'll take that chance, 'cuz I just wanna breathe
And I won't look back and wonder how it's supposed to be
How it's supposed to be

Lada, duda, duda, duda, duda
Lada, duda, duda, duda, dayiyayi
Lada, duda, duda, duda, dayiyayi,
Lada, duda, duda (x2)

I'm packin' my bags 'cause I don't wanna be
The only one who's drowning in their misery
And I'll take that chance, 'cuz I just wanna breathe
And I won't look back and wonder how it's supposed to be
How it's supposed to be

Lada, duda, duda, duda, duda
Lada, duda, duda, duda, dayiayi
Lada, duda, duda, duda, dayiyayi,
Lada, duda, duda

I'm packin' my bags 'cause I don't wanna be
The only one who's drowning in their misery
And I'll take that chance, 'cuz I just wanna breathe
And I won't look back and wonder how it's supposed to be
How it's supposed to be

Cuz' I'm packin my bags
Cuz' I'm packin my bags...
And I won't be back
Yeah...
