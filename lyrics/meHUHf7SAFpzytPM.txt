Let the sun rain down on me
'Til covered in dew
All pink and new and reborn
Cut past the grey and countless forms
Condemned to be killed or be conquered.

Slender as a carp you are
Your skin defiantly silver and so sure
As for me, I am not so sure
I watch you skate like a knife
Beneath the water

Though I can see clearly what's ahead of me
I cannot stop it once I'm set a-spinning
What can it mean, why must I always see
The ending at the beginning?

Together going arm and arm
To meet our solitude, to meet it head on
I'll meet you where the water's warm
To meet my solitude, to meet it head on

Though I can see clearly ahead of me
I cannot stop it once I'm set a-spinning
What can it mean? Why must I always see
The ending at the beginning?
