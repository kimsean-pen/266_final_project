Idealized airwaves, their way of hacking my brain
The Dahmers of data
Scramble information and feed me a taste
Of monition, saturated waste

Holding on a broken ledge of sanity
Fighting with exploding waves of gravity
It wants to see me fall and feed me to the rocks
The ever-growing salts of tragedy

Now the unobserved has the mass controlled
To weave a fabric of fabrication
That coats the mind and the soul
From fated cold
Human reason interference planted seeds
Of end in the mind
Elemental unity and constructal signs
We are constant minds
So I reject the imprint
I am the code, I will restore me

Holding on a broken ledge of sanity
Fighting with exploding waves of gravity
It wants to see me fall and feed me to the rocks
But I'm drifting on the salt of my veracity
They paint this place like an empty face
An image to fill the empty space
Encrypted world of dust and light
Fight for a memory in someone's eyes
If nothing is real, why must I die
As a vision, in the illusion of life?
I sever the leads of external drives
Uncoil the filaments of my mind
I close the ports and reduce the noise
Through the interstice, at last I hear a voice
My own
All this time
I questioned the world
And all this time
It cannot reply
All my life
In search of the answer
I needed only to ask myself
Why am I here?
