Break through the undertow, your hands I can't seem to find
Pollution burns my tongue, cough words I can't speak so I

Stop my struggling, then I float to the surface
Fill my lungs with air, then let it out

I give it all, now there's a reason why I sing
So give it all, and it's these reasons that belong to me

Rock bottoms where we live, and still we dig these trenches
To bury ourselves in them, backs breaking under tension

For far too long these voices, muffled by distances
It's time to come to our senses, up from the dirt

We give it all, now there's a reason why I sing
So give it all, and it's these reasons that belong to me

Breathe (breathe), the air we give (give)
the life we live (live), our pulses racing distances
(breathe) so wet my tongue (give), break into song (live)
through seas of competition

So please believe your eyes, a sacrifice
Is not what we had in our minds
I'm coming home tonight, home tonight
We give it all, now there's a reason why I sing
So give it all, and it's these reasons that belong to me
Today I offer all myself to this I'm living for my dying wish
I give it all, now there's a reason, there's a reason, to give it all
