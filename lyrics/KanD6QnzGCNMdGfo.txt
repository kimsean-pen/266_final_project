Light don't stick to you
Like they used to do
Think you've lost your shine

Wishing days away
Busy chasing trains
Leaving us behind

Let's get a ticket for those tracks
Don't say a word and don't look back
Let's get out of here We can get lost between the rails
We've never been afraid to fail

If you dig up your roots
Then I'll dig up my roots
And we can take them with us
Wherever we go
And all that we are
Is in the beat of hearts
And I know we're ready
To dive into the unknown, 'cause I'm caught in the middle
I'd rather break out on my own, 'cause I'm caught in the middle

Sights set to the sky
Sick of standing by
Getting itchy feet

Need some new places
Meet some new faces
No one left to please

We're carrying our roots
In everything we do
You know there's nothing left here for us
We've got everything we need
It takes a leap to plant the seed
You know there's nothing left here for us
