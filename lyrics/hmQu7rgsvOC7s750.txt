Should I go over
Cause if I get closer
Well I know where it leads to
She makes it harder to keep good intentions
When I know what she wishing
She was making it so obvious
When she spoke to me without her lips
So is it my fault I can't resist
When I know just what she wants from this

She just wants pleasure, pleasure
Someone to hold her tight
Pleasure, pleasure take her to paradise
Pleasure, pleasure someone to treat her right
She don't want my heart she just want my time
She don't want my heart she just want my time
She don't want my heart she just want my time
She don't want my heart she just want my time
She don't want my heart I said it's alright

She don't want emotion
Cause she'll get too close and
Well she know where it leads to
Hearts can get broken
When those doors are opened so she just keeps her distance
She was making it so obvious
When she got me in her fingertips
So is it my fault I can't resist
When I know just what she wants from this

She just wants pleasure, pleasure
Someone to hold her tight
Pleasure, pleasure take her to paradise
Pleasure, pleasure someone to treat her right
She don't want my heart she just want my time
She don't want my heart she just want my time
She don't want my heart she just want my time
She don't want my heart she just want my time
She don't want my heart I said it's alright
