(Van Drunen / Van Drunen, Daniels)

Behold my final testimony
I'm the survivor of my race
hear the tale of sadness and genocide
where the species disappeared
and the trees could no longer breathe
a drama of collective suicide
as we let our children suffer
in a paradise long gone
utopia has never within reach
but we still kept believing
in the madness and the lies
read my words that's all that I beseech

As we died because of our ignorance
as we died because of greed
because of our stupidity
now I'm the last one to scream

The mountains now are rising
and the oceans start to boil
the final convulsion of the earth
the heat is melting every stone
volcanes start to roar
cosmic chaos no hope for rebirth
I'm the living witness
of the torment and the pain
I was doomed to see the planet die
together with the tragedy
I'm craving for relief
eternally the universe will cry
