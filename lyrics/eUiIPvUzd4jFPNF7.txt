Our eagle once proud
Soon bald and croaking
Our chants once loud
Will quiet down. Hearts broken
Your hopes always were
Airy and unreal
'Cause you try not to see
What's there for you to see

You said we didn't bleed enough
Are we bleeding enough for you now?
You said we didn't bleed enough
Are we bleeding enough for you now?
Lei-la-la-lei, Lei-la-la-lei - Uropia O Morte!

We're snakes lurching in the laurels
When you pin medals on theives
Our cause, our swords they rose
From secret fields
Are we to dance in the ashes of your hate?
And if by chance war is won
Treat it as a wake

You said we didn't bleed enough
Are we bleeding enough for you now?
You said we didn't bleed enough
Are we bleeding enough for you now?
Are you sure we're not bleeding
Enough for you now?
Are you sure we're not bleeding
Enough for you now?
Lei-la-la-lei, Lei-la-la-lei - Utopia O Morte!
