It's a dark road
And a dark way that leads to my house
And the word says
That you're never gonna find me there, oh no
I've got an open door
It didn't get there by itself
It didn't get there by itself...

There's a feelin'
But you're not feelin' it at all
There's a meaning
But you're not listening any more
I look at that open road
I'm gonna walk there by myself...

Uuhhhh

And if you catch me I might try to run away
You know I can't be there too long
And if you let me I might try to make you stay
Seems you never realise a good thing till it's gone...

Ohhh ... uuhhh . uhhhh

Maybe I'm still searchin' but I don't know what it means
All the fires of destruction are still burnin' in my dreams
There's no water that can wash away this longin' to come clean...

Hey . yeah . yeah ...
Ohh . uhh ... uhhh

I can't find the joy within in my soul
It's just sadness takin' hold
I wanna come in from the cold
And make myself renewed again
It takes strength to live this way
The same old madness everyday
I wanna kick these blues away
I wanna learn to live again

Hey . hey . hey
Hey . hey . hey

It's a dark road
And a dark way that leads to my house
And the word says
That you're never gonna find me there oh no
I've got an open door
It didn't get there by itself... ooh
It didn't get there by itself
