Is this really how quickly it goes away?
I can't feel my emotions arrive today.

Cos I still love how you say my name.
Still taste you kissing my pain away.
Still see your tears through the rain.
This burning sensation sustain.

Feel the distance, bring us closer.
Water would cool and soothe my pain.
If we could touch now, just hold on now,
Bridges would never burn again.

I've seen this yearning take on a frightening form.
The memory of you will make sure my past lingers on.

And I still love how you say my name...
I still taste you kissing my pain away.
Still see your tears through the rain.
This burning sensation sustain.

Feel the distance, bring us closer.
Water would cool and soothe my pain.
If we could touch now, just hold on now,
Bridges would never burn again.

Don't you worry, there'll be a time when our hearts beat the same.
Let life carry. Across the distance I still see your flame.
Don't you worry there'll be a time when our hearts beat the same.
Let life carry.

Still love how you say my name...
I still taste you kissing my pain away.
Still see your tears through the rain.
This burning sensation sustain.

Feel the distance, bring us closer.
Water would cool and soothe my pain.
If we could touch now, just hold on now,
Bridges would never burn again.
