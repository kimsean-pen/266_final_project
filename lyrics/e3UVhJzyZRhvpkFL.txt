You've gotta hope that there's someone for you
As strange as you are
Who can cope with the things that you do
Without trying too hard

Because you can bend the truth
Until it's soothing you
These things that you're wrapping all around you
You never know what they will amount to
And your life is just going on without you
It's the end of the things you know
Here we go

You've gotta know that there's more to this world
Than what you have seen
Because we all have a limited view of what we can be

As we move along
With our blinders on
Each one of us feels a little stranded
And you can't explain or understand it
Each one of us on a different planet
And admist all the to and fro
Someone can say "Hello,
Here we go"

The feeling that someone really gets you
It's something that no one should object to
It could happen today so I suggest you
Skip your habit of laying low
It's the end of the things you know
Here we go

Because someone can say "Hello,
You old so and so, here we go"
