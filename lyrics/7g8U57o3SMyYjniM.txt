A boy from Florida
Took a trip to the Caribbeans
Umbrella in his daiquiri
Sipping, listening to Bob Marley

He came to get away
He came to get over it
Sunglasses and his radio
Chilling in a hammock swaying to-and-fro
Whoa, Soul Rebel in stereo

You bring the ocean, I'll bring emotion
Together we'll make a love potion
You bring the ocean, I'll bring the motion
Dancing all night in slow motion

He came to get away, he came to get over her
Laptop and his cell phone,
Throw it in the ocean to be all alone
Whoa, Soul Rebel in stereo

You bring the ocean, I'll bring emotion
Together we'll make a love potion
You bring the ocean, I'll bring the motion
Dancing all night in slow motion

Don't you worry, boy
Take your time, don't hurry
Don't you worry, boy
Take your time, don't hurry

You bring the ocean, I'll bring emotion
Together we'll make a love potion
You bring the ocean, I'll bring the motion
Dancing all night in slow motion
You bring the ocean, I'll bring emotion
Together we'll make a love potion
You bring the ocean, I'll bring the motion
Dancing all night in slow motion
