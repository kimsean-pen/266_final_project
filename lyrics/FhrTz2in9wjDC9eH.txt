I take her home, it's late at night
She's lookin' good, hot tonight
And I wanna know, how far she goes
She gives the clue, I make my move
I got the rhythm in the groove
Slow at times, right tonight

She wants money, she
She wants money, she wants money
She wants money, she wants money
She wants money

She's so ready, doesn't even care
She's like a razor cuttin' through the air
She's callin' me, I'm so at ease
I understand what she's tellin' me
It's so clear that even I can see
You wanna play, you've gotta pay

(Chorus)

I try to tell her I don't have no cash
She looks at me and starts to laugh
I don't wanna know, you've gotta go
I see her walkin' on down the street
She sees another and she acts so sweet
You wanna try, your luck tonight

She wants money, she
She wants money, she wants money (repeat)
Yeah, just money

She walks the streets all night alone
She acts so sweet, she makes it known

She wants money
She wants money, she
She wants money, she wants money (repeat)
She wants money, quick change
She wants money, she wants money (repeat)
She wants money, oh she
She wants money, she wants money (repeat)
She wants money, she makes me feel so good
She wants money, oh she
She wants money...
