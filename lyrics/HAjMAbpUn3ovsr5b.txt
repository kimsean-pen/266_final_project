You left a key hidden by the back door
But I never showed up
There was something sleazy about it
That made me wanna rob the place and run

Now I've been ignoring the calls
I've been riding my bike with no handlebars
Through empty streets in the dark
And I think I'm getting pretty good

Maybe I'll leave the house tonight
Maybe I'll even watch the band and maybe I'll cry
Maybe I'll tell everyone I cried while you
Sleep next to your wife for the rest of your life
While I'm ridin' in the dark
On my bike with no handlebars
Yeah

And I heard it from a friend
That he talks to the primary school kids through the fence
Yeah you shoulda seen his book collection
It was all 'how to socialise and how to make friends'
Yeah I guess we both got our problems
And areas to improve
And I know one of mine is to go a night without sympathising with you

I can see myself living without you
I can see myself living without you
I can see myself living without you
I can see myself living without you and being fine
For the rest of my life
Its just me on that bike
Yeah and I'll wave to you as I ride by
