you always wanted a real nice lawn now your
whole back yard is gone too bad you tried to
cut your grass too bad that you ran out of gas
you drank just one too many beers now it's in
your car and back to sears it ate up half your
bedroom rug but now you've got brand new
sparkplugs you gotta bitchin mower now you
think you are the cats meow you only
have yourself to thank when
we put draino in your tank
