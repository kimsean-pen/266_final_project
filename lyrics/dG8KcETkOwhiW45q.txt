Did you find out how to heal?
From all the hurt that you fought alone
Did you find what you were looking for?
In that place you always knew you had to go

Heat can heal you
We could have burned it all down
We could have started over

July

Spring fires arrived
Like an omen
I should have known

Memories are lies or dreams
I can't decide what's worse for me
