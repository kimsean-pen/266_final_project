Push it in hear a shout
Take pen talk about
Fit the role play it out
Down this lonely lane without love
(Without love)

Call a friend fuck it out
Honesty is still the route
We respect only doubt
'Cause we falling either ways we down and out...

Straight jacket and a hair tie
Subtle gaze with some tight plays
I'm rubber necking hard for you
Meditations holy scars on you

Sullen energies to fill up my soul
Crown Pedigree showing me whole
Dive for the moments Juliet knows
Caesar once had a plan too

She had a four pillars
She never fell to far from a tree

Chief good broke hearts
Nice top
She never felt so lost

In the woods she went
Calling shots through a storm
She made

Snatching all the souls
Melo-drama to the road she paved

Straight jacket and a hair tie
Hard stare when you know they care
I'm rubber necking hard for you
Lacking patience in the stars on you

Sullen energies to fill up my soul
Crown Pedigree in showing me whole
Dive for the moments Juliet knows
Caesar once had a plan too
