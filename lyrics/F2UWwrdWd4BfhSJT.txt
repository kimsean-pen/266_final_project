She's a metropolitain girl
In a fancy raven dress on
She's allright when everything's wrong

She is dancing in the streets all night
She is merging with the city lights
She can cheat you or can be your guide
She's a spirit of the night

She's a spirit of the night
She kneels me down
She kneels me down
I wear a plastic crown

She's a metropolitain girl
Maybe someone that I could have known
Maybe lives or maybe plays a role

She's a phantom flying like a kite
She's got twilight walking by her side
She's the one who allways on my mind
She's a spirit of the night

She's a spirit of the night
She kneels me down
She kneels me down
I wear a plastic crown
