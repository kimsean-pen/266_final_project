I was huddled in a doorway
Fighting off a trance
With my bag pulled to my chest
She asked me if I was waiting for something
I said the answer one thousand times over was yes

Well, here I am
Or a shadow of me
Oh, but deep down inside
My heart runs free

I was a used shoes salesman
And I was working the graveyard shift
I was listening for the bell on the door hoping you'd walk in
I was living in the weeds somewheres
I was breathing through a straw in the swamp
And I was gasping for air, wondering what it was for

But I have a child now
And she's better than me
Oh, but deep down inside
I hope she makes the same mistakes as me

Well, sometimes love is all it's supposed to be
But it can break you
Remember, take care of your heart
And cry
Oh, but somehow we'll survive

For another day
By picking up our own feet
I was wandering around in the streets
Somewheres outside of Eden
She came down to let me in
And then she left for the light
I was creeping through
Through the brush and the shadows
Man, I was scared for my life

But I am saved now
Somebody died for my sins
And I'm so glad it wasn't me

Sometimes lust is not such a crazy thing
But it can break you
Remember, take care of your heart
And cry
Oh, but somehow we'll survive

For another day
Oh, just for another day
Not by walking away
Nah, I'll stay

Sometimes love is all it's supposed to be
But it can break you
Remember, take care of your heart
And cry
Oh and somehow we'll survive
For another day
Oh, just for another day
