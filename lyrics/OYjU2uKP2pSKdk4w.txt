All the pictures I took
Remind me with a look
Just how good things used to be
Every floor where I slept
And the lack of friends that I kept
Tell you all you need to know

And I've chased this dream for so damn long
I'm old enough, I should know better
It doesn't help I'm blinded by faith I had when I was young
All my friends have all grown up (Grown up)
They'd remember me if my name came up (Came up)
Pretty sure I'd remember them if I wasn't such a thoughtless dick

All the roads that we'd seen
And the states where we'd been
Gave us hope when we barely had a thing
I just pray that we can make it
And finish what we started
'Cause I've given too much blood to live in this world alone (Alone)

And I've chased this dream for so damn long
I'm old enough, I should know better
It doesn't help I'm blinded by faith I had when I was young
All my friends have all grown up (Grown up)
They'd remember me if my name came up (Came up)
Pretty sure I'd remember them if I wasn't such a thoughtless

I don't wanna start over, but it feels like we're crashing down
I don't wanna start over, but it feels like we're crashing down
Mayday, we're crashing to hit rock bottom

Mayday, we're crashing to hit rock bottom
Mayday, we're crashing to hit rock bottom
Mayday, we're crashing to hit rock bottom
Mayday!
Mayday, we're crashing to hit rock bottom
Mayday, we're crashing to hit rock bottom
Mayday, we're crashing to hit rock bottom
Mayday, mayday!
