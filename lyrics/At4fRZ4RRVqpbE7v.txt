Things come rushing in
Things come rushing out
When your in a dream
If your in a dream

Your just a sleepy company and thats alright
Your just a sleepy company well, thats alright

I'm picking up the remnants of
Another lost sunday...
Dig a hole in the cracks of the logic transistors
Dig a hole and listen for the history

Your just a sleepy company and thats alright
Your just a sleepy company and thats alright
