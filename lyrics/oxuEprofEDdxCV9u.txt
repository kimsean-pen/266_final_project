I don't want to hold you and feel so helpless
I don't want to smell you and lose my senses
And smile in slow motion with eyes in love

I twist like a corkscrew, the sweetness rising
I drink from the bottle weeping
Why won't you last?
Why can't you last?
So I will walk without care, beat my snare
Look like a man who means business
Go to all the poshest places with the familiar faces
Terminate all signs of weakness

Chorus:
Oh, all for the sake, all for the sake
Of a foolish love

I will take my coffee black, never snack
Hang with the wolves who are sheepish
Flow through the veins of town, always frown
Me and my mistress the princess

Chorus

So the day Noah's Ark floats down Park
My eyes will be simply glazed over
Or better yet
I'll wear shades on sunless days
And when the sun's out, I'll stay in and slumber

Chorus

cause I don't want to hold you and feel so helpless
I don't want to smell you and lose my senses
And smile in slow motion with eyes in love
