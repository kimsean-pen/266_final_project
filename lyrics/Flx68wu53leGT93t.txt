I knew he was different in his sexuality
I went to his parties as a straight minority
It never seemed a threat to my masculinity
He only introduced me to a wider reality

As the years went by, we drifted apart
When I heard that he was gone, I felt a shadow cross my heart

But he's nobody's Hero:
Saves a drowning child,
Cures a wasting disease
Hero:
Lands the crippled airplane,
Solves great mysteries
Hero:
Not the handsome actor
Who plays a hero's role
Hero: not the glamor girl
Who'd love to sell her soul
If anybody's buying Nobody's hero

I didn't know the girl, but I knew her family
All their lives were shattered
in a nightmare of brutality
They try to carry on, try to bear the agony
Try to hold some faith in the goodness of humanity

As the years went by, we drifted apart
When I heard that she was gone, I felt a shadow cross my heart

But she's nobody's Hero:
Is the voice of reason
Against the howling mob
Hero:
Is the pride of purpose
In the unrewarding job
Hero:
not the champion player
Who plays the perfect game
Hero:
Not the glamor boy
Who loves to sell his name
Everybody's buying
Nobody's hero

As the years went by, we drifted apart
When I heard that you were gone, I felt a shadow cross my heart

But he's nobody's Hero:
Saves a drowning child
Cures a wasting disease
Hero:
Lands the crippled airplane,
Solves great mysteries
Hero:
Not the handsome actor
Who plays a hero's role
Hero: not the glamor girl
Who'd love to sell her soul
If anybody's buying Nobody's hero

Nobody's hero
Hero
Nobody's hero
Hero
