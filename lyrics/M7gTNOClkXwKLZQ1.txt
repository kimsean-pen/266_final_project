I know that you like dancing
I know that you want to be seen
I know that you want the queen
Everybody wants to be king

And the fire's burning
The devil's dancing in your head
All the wolves are howling
Begging to be fed

I'm screaming out loud
I'm reaching for the clouds
Will they listen to me now

I'm screaming out loud
I'm reaching for the clouds
Will they listen to me now

I know that you felt something
I know that you want to believe
Someone broke your trust
Dragging you right through the mud

*Goddamn*

The fire's burning
The wolves still howling
The devil's dancing
Dancing in your head

I'm gonna put this out
If you're broken down
I will pick up
All the pieces
Pieces of you now

I'm screaming out loud
I'm reaching for the clouds
Will they listen to me now

I'm screaming out loud
I'm reaching for the clouds
Will they listen to me now

There's no science to my love
There's no science to my love
It's only magic
All the magic

There's no science to my love
There's no science to my love
It's only magic
All the magic

I'm screaming out loud
I'm reaching for the clouds
Will they listen to me now

I'm screaming out loud
I'm reaching for the clouds
Will they listen to me now

There's no science to my love
There's no science to my love
It's only magic
All the magic

There's no science to my love
There's no science to my love
It's only magic
All the magic

I'm screaming out loud
I'm reaching for the clouds
Will they listen to me now

I'm screaming out loud
I'm reaching for the clouds
Will they listen to me now
