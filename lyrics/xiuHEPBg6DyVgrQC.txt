All my life I've been the slave of consequence,
wondering how this life could be so intricate,
I wanna rewrite my heart and let the future in,
I wanna open it up and let somebody in.

Can you free me from the logic that I knew,
I'll believe it even if it's not true.

Am I falling asleep on my feet again?
I call out, is anybody listening?
And it's like I'm diving into emptiness
but at least there's something beating in my chest.

Will you free me from the logic that I knew,
I'll believe it even if it's not true.
