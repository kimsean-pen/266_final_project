Yeah
For all my real ATL niggas, that's right
This the dope boy anthem
Come on

Money, hoes, cars and clothes
That's how all my niggas roll
Blowing dro on 24's
That's how all my niggas roll
Money, hoes, cars and clothes
That's how all my niggas roll
Blowing dro on 24's
That's how all my niggas roll

I'm in a drop-top Chevy with the roof wide open
My partners looking at me to see if my eyes open
'Cause I've been dranking and I've been smoking
And flying down 285 but I'm focused
It's a 454 SS, I race Porsches
White leather seats, as fresh as Air Forces
Doing 'bout a hundred but the track still bumping
Number 8 on N.W.A, "Straight Outta Compton"
Pull up at your apartment sitting on 20 somethings
And the dope boys hollering "What's happening?" kid running in
The cliques start dancing and the broads start choosing
And the cars been parked but the rims keep moving
Sign pictures, buy an onion of good and throw the deuces
Cause I ain't Hollywood, I come from the hood, I'm used to it
If your rear view shaking and your seats vibrating
24 inch Dayton's got the Chevrolet skatin' makin'

Money, hoes, cars and clothes
That's how all my niggas roll
Blowing dro on 24's
That's how all my niggas roll
Money, hoes, cars and clothes
That's how all my niggas roll
Blowing dro on 24's
That's how all my niggas roll

I make a million and I'm satisfied, I'll get the rest
Underaged civilian in the tigthest ride, I want the best
I refuse to get a 9 to 5, I'mma flip my keys
Been paying my dues since '89, tryna get my cheese
Diamonds gleam when I'm on the scene, they know it's me
Ain't no dream or no fantasy bitch, it's T-I-P
Broad busting, like a baby do a binky
Five karat DVS's on my mothafuckin' pinkie
Half of Hennessy and Belvedere's what we drinking
Pimp squad send for broads, what the hell you niggas thinking?

Young nigga spending weekends on the islands in the fall
24 inch rim shining when I'm riding cause I'm balling
I'm calling out shots like a pool shark
My tools spark in the dark when I fool marks
Y'all fools hearts in the wrong place
At the wrong time, I got a strong mind
To grab my chrome nine and shoot at your ass for a long time
But I'mma get that ass hauled off, fuck around with the clique
They'll be looking for your dick with a stick, nigga y'all soft
So y'all lost, I'mma ball out at all costs, spit game to a dame
Make her ride on this thang
'Til she falls off and sucks balls off, I got the

Money, hoes, cars and clothes
That's how all my niggas roll
Blowing dro on 24's
That's how all my niggas roll
Money, hoes, cars and clothes
That's how all my niggas roll
Blowing dro on 24's
That's how all my niggas roll

I'm not boucing little shorty, I'm relaxing right now
I'd probably still be trapping if I wasn't rapping right now
Bragging about pistols at the house, guess who's strapped right now
Keep on talking folk, I'll lay you on your back right now
Want to act right now, get smacked right now
I'm a bankhead mothafucka, I don't know how to back down
Clown down here fakin', frontin'
Talking 'bout what you making: nothin'
I'm 21 and 10 years deep, that shit to me ain't nothing
I'm raised by the niggas getting head from the jays
Lose your leg when I spray, end up dead from the K
Stay ready for the raid, paid heavy from the yay'
I told my class to kiss my ass, I make 11 everyday

Money, hoes, cars and clothes
That's how all my niggas roll
Blowing dro on 24's
That's how all my niggas roll
Money, hoes, cars and clothes
That's how all my niggas roll
Blowing dro on 24's
That's how all my niggas roll

Money, hoes, cars and clothes
That's how all my niggas roll
Blowing dro on 24's
That's how all my niggas roll
Money, hoes, cars and clothes
That's how all my niggas roll
