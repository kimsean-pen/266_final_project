City life.
Calling me all the time
And my soul
Geared to attack
Never get a better chance
So what you doing?
Gotta get money
Ain't quite what you're doing

Can't stand the loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand loneliness

Should not lie
I'm tryin' not to laugh though
You won't get money
From doing what you're loving
I'm moving out of city
Victor of a second chance,
Got a lot of problems,
Gotta get rid of them

Can't stand the loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand loneliness

Can't stand the loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand loneliness

Can't stand the loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
