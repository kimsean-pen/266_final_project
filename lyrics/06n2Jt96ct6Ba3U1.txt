I'm not over it
and I don't believe in anything (anything)
And now she's under here
and been telling me how I should feel again (again)
I'll sell your breath for you
Cause the whole world's gonna know what you do (woo-hoo)
A car is my best friend
Cause he gets his own way in the end
You want
Madonna
To hang on your wall
I'll take-a
Her picture
Send it through for you-oo
Ay-yi-yi-aaai, ay-yi-yi-aaaai
ay-yi-yi-aaaai
Tell me what you want
Woo-hoo
Tell me how you sleep
I drag you back from every dream (every dream)
I know just what you did
And when you pulled out did it think of me (of me)
I'll sell your breath for you
Cause the whole world's gonna know what you do(woo-hoo)
A car is my best friend
Cause she gets her own way in the end
You want
Madonna
To hang on your wall
I'll take-a
Her picture
Send it through for you-oo
Ay-yi-yi-aaai, ay-yi-yi-aaaai (woohoo)
ay-yi-yi-aaaai
Tell me what you want
Woo-hoo
You want
Madonna
To hang on your wall
I'll take-a
Her picture
Send it through for you-oo
Ay-yi-yi-aaai, ay-yi-yi-aaaai (woohoo)
ay-yi-yi-aaaai
Tell me what you want
