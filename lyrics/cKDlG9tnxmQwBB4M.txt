We're both here 'cause we both want the same thing
Won't ask for more, I know you'll do the same
Been here before, there's no shame in my game
So just use me, use me, oh

Get in your car at 3AM, and get yourself to where I am
We both know, what's about to go down
My door's unlocked, I'm in the back
The lights are off, it's soldier black
This ain't the first time I've been around

You give it to me, everything's free
Take what you need
I'm here to please

We're both here 'cause we both want the same thing
Won't ask for more, I know you'll do the same
Been here before, there's no shame in my game
So just use me, use me, oh

Grippin' the chain, around your neck
Don't be soft, I don't need respect
It's all about me getting what's mine
I say yes or I say no, I say stop or I say go
But right now, I just want a rough night

You give it to me, everything's free
Take what you need
I'm here to please

We're both here 'cause we both want the same thing
Won't ask for more, I know you'll do the same
Been here before, there's no shame in my game
So just use me, use me, oh

We're both here 'cause we both want the same thing
Won't ask for more, I know you'll do the same
Been here before, there's no shame in my game
So just use me, use me, oh

We're both here 'cause we both want the same thing
Won't ask for more, I know you'll do the same
Been here before, there's no shame in my game
So just use me, use me, oh
