I swear I'm face to face with heartbreak
But you might be the best mistake I've ever made, ever made

I swear you were the light that guides my way but
The light went out now I'm just trying to find my place, find my place

I tell you that I wanna talk, but you don't wanna go there
I swear its like a nightmare,
and then you hit me with the blank stare and I know where we stand,
and everything we never said it took toll on us and now at the edge
of it all, it's come crashing down,
you push me away and now I'm on the ground

On the sideline, the sideline, sideline,
used to be the spotlight, the spotlight in your eyes

And now I'm in the sidelines, the sidelines,
sidelines, used to be the spotlight, the spotlight in your eyes
