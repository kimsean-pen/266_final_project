Out of ruins obscured
Unveiling Stygian art
Our naked and cynical stare
As we drink from the night itself

Eternal madness
Eternal myth
Reconstruction from within

The tyranny of chaos
Inside repression's eye

In the book of dead names
From skepticism born
Enshrouded with our wretched hopes
As we drink from the night itself

Eternal madness
Eternal myth
Reconstruction from within

Frozen resonated visions
Masked in comforting lies
With seducing rhythm blessed
As all opposition dies

Out of ruins obscured
Unveiling Stygian art
Our naked and cynical stare
As we drink from the night itself

Eternal madness
Eternal myth
Reconstruction from within
Eternal slumber
Eternal sleep
Reconstruction from within

As we drink from the night itself
As we drink from the night itself
As we drink from the night itself
