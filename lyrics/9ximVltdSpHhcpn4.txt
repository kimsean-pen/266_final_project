You're a beautiful sight
In your black dress garble
Your hearts full of lust
But you're all out of luck
A dead man's curve knows no partiality
Takes you from me
You fall out
You fall out
You fall out
You double dare
And tumble and tear
No one can say
You're worse ofr wear
You try to dream
But it's to dark in there
You call out
You call out
You call out
It doesn't matter
What the doctors say
You're all broke up
You won't care anyway
It doesn't matter
Anyone will do
You're all broke up
You're all broke up
And I wake up
From a sleep so dead
I see you standing
Beside my bed
You touch my hand
And let go of my heart
And then you depart
And I call out
And I call out
And I call out
You're gone now
You're gone now
Bad accident last night
Interstate 95You can read all about it today
Me and my love said goodbye
In our own way
