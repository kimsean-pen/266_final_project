Bury the tongue between the teeth
Open the jaw and sink in deep
Force it open and claw the grip
Down throat, you let it slip, slip, slip, slip, slip

(Let it sink
Don't let it hold you down)

In the static you are reborn
(Let it sink
Don't let it hold you down)
In the white nights, what you ask for
(Let it sink
Don't let it hold you down)
Fire the cue, and I'll come for
(Let it sink
Don't let it hold you down)
Give you the marks of a lost war
(Let it sink
Don't let it hold you down)

Cut knife, deep in, spit down, swallow
(Let it sink
Don't let it hold you down)
Sword up, nock in, and turn the bow
(Let it sink
Don't let it hold you down)
Sever in two and fuse to gold
(Let it sink
Don't let it hold you down)

Down throat, you let it go
