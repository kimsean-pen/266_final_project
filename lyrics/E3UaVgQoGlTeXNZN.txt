I'm a broken doll,
And you're the puppeteer,
Take control for me
And wipe away my fear.

I don't claim to be perfect -
I know I'm damaged goods,
But I wanna be let out of darkness
Just like every lady would.

Lick my wounds and watch them seal
With a healing heart,
Embrace my sadness, look after me,
'Cause there's no-one else I'd ask.

I'm a broken doll,
And you're the puppeteer,
Take control for me
And wipe away my fear.

Piece me all together,
The broken high and sweet,
You thought my heart was made of wood
But I can hear it beat.

I'm scared of shadows in the night,
When you're not there by my side.
Sick of nightmares in my sleep -
There's no place I can hide.

See the beauty in the blood,
That drips down from my eyes
Hold the parts that were ripped out
That had took me by surprise.

I'm a broken doll,
And you're the puppeteer,
Take control for me
And wipe away my fear.

Piece me all together,
The broken high and sweet,
You thought my heart was made of wood
But I can hear it beat.

Boom, Boom,
There it goes,
Boom, Boom,
To the sound of the grand piano.
I'm dancing in your light,
And I like it.

I'm a broken doll,
And you're the puppeteer,
Take control for me
And wipe away my fear.

I'm a broken doll,
And you're the puppeteer,
Take control for me
And wipe away my fear.

Piece me all together,
The broken high and sweet,
You thought my heart was made of wood
But I can hear it beat.

I'm a broken doll,
And you're the puppeteer,
Take control for me
And wipe away my fear.

Piece me all together,
The broken high and sweet,
You thought my heart was made of wood
But I, I hear it beat.
