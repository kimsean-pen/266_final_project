Are you listening, Javelina?
Every corner of the coast is still clear
All dressed up
With some medicine for luck
How I hope that you're still here
When I return

Burning bridges is a form of suicide
I saw the fires as the ghost of my life
Passed me by and there's nowhere you can hide
From the lessons or the lies that bind them

I'm so tired
I've had enough
If there's one thing I've learned
You'll always get burned
But you'll never give it up

Can we count on our conversations
to restore us like energon cubes?
Made one wish for a permanent kiss
That would echo through these bones like arsenic
I can figure out the point of anything
Just not as quick as I can mess up my life
With all my dreams hooked to hospital machines
I think 'Let's try redefining beautiful'

I'm so tired
I've had enough
If there's one thing I've learned
You'll always get burned
But You'll never give it up

This is the best that will get
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, get it up, get it up)
This is the best that will get
(Yeah, Yeah, get it up)

I can figure out the point of anything
I can figure out the point of anything
I can figure out the point of anything
I can figure out the point of anything
I can figure out the point of anything
I can figure out the point of it

I'm so tired
I've had enough
If there's one thing I've learned
You'll always get burned
But you'll never give it up

I'm so tired
I've had enough
If there's one thing I've learned
You'll always get burned
But uou'll never give it up
