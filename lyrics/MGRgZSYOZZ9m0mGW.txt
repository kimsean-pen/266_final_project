Giving our blood
To the Doomsday Machine
Fighting for ravaged land
A worthless gain
Marching on a dead end road

A violent new disorder
Feeding off mistrust
Forgot what we were fighting for
A worthless aim
A victory stinking of despair

Dead eyes
See no future
Falling from grace
We are coming home
Dead eyes
See no future
Falling from grace
We are coming home

Battalions of hate
Seeking shelter in Hell
Bloodstained memories
We we ever be forgiven?
Our twisted fate
Time will tell

Dead Eyes
See No Future
Falling from grace
We are coming home
Dead eyes
See no future
Falling from grace
We are coming home

Dead eyes
See no future
Falling from grace
We are coming home

Dead eyes
See no Future
