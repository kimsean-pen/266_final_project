Can't sleep tonight
I feel so shaken
Baby the wind has changed again
You came to me
Straight out of nowhere
Taking me where I've never been

Suddenly all of my fences have broken
I'm cutting the reins of my life

Woah runaway horses
Woah take us through the night
You and I on runaway horses
Oooh, ooh, baby hold on tight
Ooooh, oooh, baby hold on tight

Out on this road
Everything changes
Though nothing ever stays the same
Faith comes and goes
Dreams are foresaken

We take our chances, every day
I want you here with me
Pray for our destiny
Here on this mystery ride

Woah runaway horses
Woah take us through the night
You and I on runaway horses
Oooh, ooh, baby hold on tight

Woah racing through the darkness
Woah, oh, trying to find a light
You and I arerunaway horses
Oooh, ooh, baby hold on tight
Oooh, ooh, baby hold on tight
Oooh, ooh, baby hold on tight

Open my eyes, there's so much light
I feel alive when I'm with you
With every end we'll begin again

Woah runaway horses
Woah take us through the night
You and I on runaway horses
Oooh, ooh, baby hold on tight

Woah racing through the darkness
Woah trying to find the light
You and I on runaway horses
Oooh, ooh, baby hold on tight

Oooh, ooh, baby hold on tight
Oooh, ooh, baby hold on tight
Oooh, ooh, baby hold on tight
Hold on tight
Hold on tight
Hold on tight
Hold on tight
