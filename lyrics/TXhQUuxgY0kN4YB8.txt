Denying the lying
A million children fighting
For lives in strife
For hope beyond the horizon
A dead world, a dark path
Not even crossroads to choose from
All the bloodred carpets before me
Behold this fair creation of God

My only wish to leave behind
All the days of the Earth
And everyday hell of my kingdom come

The first rock thrown again
Welcome to hell, little Saint
Mother Gaia in slaughter
Welcome to paradise, Soldier
My first cry neverending
All life is to fear for life
You fool, you wanderer
You challenged the gods and lost

Save yourself a penny for the ferryman
Save yourself and let them suffer
In hope, in love
This world ain't ready for The Ark
Save yourself a penny for the ferryman
Save yourself and let them suffer
In hope, in love mankind works in mysterious ways

Welcome down to my planet hell

Save yourself a penny for the ferryman
Save yourself and let them suffer
In hope, in love
This world ain't ready for The Ark
Save yourself a penny for the ferryman
Save yourself and let them suffer
In hope, in love mankind works in mysterious ways
