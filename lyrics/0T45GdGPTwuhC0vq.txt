Don't be concerned
It's just the way that gravity works round here
All slowly rising
Falling patiently
Feel no
Feel no fear
Cirrus caress you
Cumulus kiss you
Raindrops of crystal
Whisper we'll miss you
But go...
Let go
Always and always and always ascending
Opening line leaves an uncertain ending
Always and always and always ascending
The chords seem to pause
But aaah...
...resolve
(Never gonna resolve)
Never gonna resolve
(Never gonna resolve)
Never gonna resolve
(Never gonna resolve)
Never gonna resolve
(Never gonna resolve)
Talk to me
(Talk to me)
Come on, talk to me
(Talk to me)
Yeah, talk to me
(Talk to me)
Aaaah
And wake me up
Come on, wake me up
Waking up dry
Waking up dusty
Feeling remorse
Feeling thirsty
Bring me a cup
Bring me water
We can ascend
From this arrangement
We can see fate as entertainment
Bring me a cup
Bring me water
Bring me water
Always and always and always ascending
The shepard misleads so you think you're transcending
Always and always and always ascending
Pause the progression
But aaah...
...resolve
(Never gonna resolve)
Never gonna resolve
(Never gonna resolve)
Never gonna resolve
(Never gonna resolve)
Never gonna resolve
(Never gonna resolve)
Talk to me
(Talk to me)
Come on, talk to me
(Talk to me)
Yeah, talk to me
(Talk to me)
Aaah
And wake me up
Come on, wake me up
Waking up dry
Waking up dusty
Feeling remorse
Feeling thirsty
Bring me a cup
Bring me water
Bring me water
Bring me water
Bring me water
Bring me water
Yeah
(Put your ladder down)
(Put your ladder down)
(Put your ladder down)
(Put your ladder down)
(Put your ladder down)
(Put your ladder down)
Cirrus caress you
Cumulus kiss you
Raindrops of crystal
Whisper we'll miss you
But go...
Let go
