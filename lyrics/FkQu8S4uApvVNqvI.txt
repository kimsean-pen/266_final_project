I can't see through the tears in my eyes!
I can't see through the tears in my eyes!
I can't breathe!

I feel I failed!
I was meant to make you smile!
I was meant to make you shine

To make you shine!
They said
This could never happen!
They said

We could never be!
Are you telling me you listened?

I was meant to make you smile!
I was meant to make you shine!

I was meant to make you smile!
I was meant to make you shine!

I was meant to make you smile!
I was meant to make you shine!
So there's no you and me?
And we can't live this way forever (forever)?

(You said you'd run away)
You said you'd run away
You said you'd run away with me (with me)

You'd run away
That we'd escape from the ordinary!
That we'd escape from the world that tied us down!
That we'd escape from the ordinary!
That we'd escape from the world that kept us apart!
(Whoa!) So now this is over and the world falls upon me
(Whoa!) I never expected to be here alone
(Whoa!) The shadows are forming as we burst into flames
(Whoa!) Why does this end this way?
Whoa!
Whoa! (Why does this end this way?)
Whoa!
Whoa!
