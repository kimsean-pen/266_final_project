Its such an ugly thing
The way you treated me
I should've walked away
Never to look back!
Its all still haunting me
I'm still in disbelief
A broken memory!
Fading into black!

I could save you
But I fucking hate you
There's no escaping and you're never gonna fucking see!
You don't know me
And you don't own me
And you can't control me
It's only in your fucking dreams!

I don't know
When I lost it all, when I lost control
I don't know
If I could ever let this
Ever let this go!

There's nothing you could say
To make me want to change
You should've walked away
Now you fucking run!
Its all just such a waste
The time you stole from me
And now you're on your knees
Look into the gun!

I won't save you
I fucking hate you
There's no escaping, and I'm never gonna fucking see!
I don't know you
And I don't want you
You're uncontrollable, a nightmare not a fucking dream!

I don't know
When I lost it all, when I lost control
I don't know
If I could ever let this
Ever let this go!

I don't know
If I could ever let this
Ever let it go!
I don't know (I don't know if I can! I don't know when I lost!)
When I lost it all, when I lost control
I don't know (I'll never let this go! I'll never let it go!)
If I could ever let this
Ever let this go!
