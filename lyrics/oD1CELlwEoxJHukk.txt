There's a girl, thought she knew
What her life was going to do
Then she goes and falls in love
And throws it all away

But her man can't decide
If he's made the right choice in life
So she comes home one day
To find he's gone away

Put your heart back in your pocket
Pick your love up off the floor
Well, your momma says you're stopping
But girl, let me tell you more

If he's 95 or 22
A boy's gonna do what he's gonna do
He says he don't love you anymore
So pick up off the floor

Walks around an empty town
Sees his face coming around
Every corner takes on a similar stay

Love is lost, love can burn
But your luck will return
But if you're dragging it down
You won't know it's there

Put your heart back in your pocket
Pick your love up off the floor
Well, your momma says you're stopping
But girl, let me tell you more

If he's 95 or 22
A boy's gonna do what he's gonna do
He says he don't love you anymore
So pick up off the floor

Put your heart back in your pocket
Pick your love up off the floor
Well, your momma says you're stopping
But girl, let me tell you more

If he's 95 or 22
A boy's gonna do what he's gonna do
He says he don't love you anymore
So pick up off the floor

Put your love, love, love (Pick up off the floor)
Ooh
(Pick up off the floor)

Put your heart back in your pocket
Pick your love up off the floor
Well, your momma says you're stopping
But girl, let me tell you more

If he's 95 or 22
A boy's gonna do what he's gonna do
He says he don't love you anymore
So pick up off the floor
