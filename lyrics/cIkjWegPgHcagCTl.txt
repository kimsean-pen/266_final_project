Are we wasting our time awake here/we could be sleeping/I'll disappear then maybe/when you're here I know I could never love you/I only dream of you after you are gone/we don't work the way we used to/your face has changed since morning/say it/I want to hear some truth/say it/say it/when you're here I know I could never love you/I only dream of you after you are gone
