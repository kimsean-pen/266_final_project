How much pain
Do you need to feel?
How much shame
Do you have to conceal?

There is no sunshine
Just endless nights
Nobody's there, nobody cares when you cry

Is it my face you see, do I haunt you in your sleep
On your hands and knees, when you crawl through your nightmares
When there's no more grace, does your heartbeat start to race?
Clawing everywhere in the dark, poisonous shadows

How many secrets
Do you keep inside?
How many sins
Do you have to hide?

The haunting masses
Have blackened the sun
You'll pay for everything you've done, one by one

Is it my face you see, do I haunt you in your sleep
On your hands and knees, when you crawl through your nightmares
When there's no more grace, does your heartbeat start to race?
Clawing everywhere in the dark, poisonous shadows

Is it my face you see, do I haunt you in your sleep
On your hands and knees, when you crawl through your nightmares
When there's no more grace, does your heartbeat start to race?
Clawing everywhere in the dark, poisonous shadows

Is it my face you see, do I haunt you in your sleep
On your hands and knees, when you crawl through your nightmares
When there's no more grace, does your heartbeat start to race?
Clawing everywhere in the dark, poisonous shadows

"...It's like, I woke up
And she was right there
I could almost touch her
Although she's been gone for years now
I can feel her...
I can feel her watching me"
