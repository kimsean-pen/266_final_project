Days feel harder
Night grows longer
Summer says its goodbyes
Darkness covers

We find shelter
Our own place to hide
Oh, as the light goes out
Thoughts turn to angels on the run
Oh as the night comes in
Dreams start their drifting

& you hear a lullaby
Lullaby, you & I
Trees touch windows
Say their hellos

Hear this house as it settles in
Worry slips away
It don't know your name
It don't know where to find us
Oh, as the light goes out
Thoughts turn to angels on the run
Oh, as the night comes in
Dreams start their drifting
& you hear a lullaby
A lullaby
You & I, you & I
