Seven in the morning
When they wake you gotta be ghost
Let me tell you one thing
I'm about to overflow
Boy you don't know my bed
Well tonight you might find out
Open up my window
Once you're in there's no way out

I'm a river
And this river's slowing down
Know where you'll wind up
Cross my water 'til you drown
I feel it, baby
Tell me what so I know how
I've been up, baby

So you can take me apart
Waited up all night
Take me apart
I wait up all night
I wait up, I wait up
All night

Afraid of falling knowing I could never live without
I try to tell you something
And then you just read my mind
Where you going, baby, without kissing me goodbye?
Try to fight it, baby
Now we're going back

My river's slowing down
Know where you'll wind up
Cross my water 'til you drown
I feel it, baby (I feel it, baby)
Tell me what so I know how
I've been up, baby

You better take me apart (Take me apart)
Waited up all night ('cause i'm waiting)
Take me apart
I wait up all night
I wait up, I wait up
All night

Now I can't keep my head up
'Cause we're talking later in night
Started a song then I gave up
So I hope this comes alright
Don't say you're in love, baby
Don't say you're in love, baby
Don't say you're in love until you learn to take me apart

Waited up all night
Take me apart
I wait up all night
I wait up, I wait up
All night

I wait up, I wait up, I wait up
Take me apart
I wait up all night
I wait up, I wait up
Take me apart
I wait up all night
