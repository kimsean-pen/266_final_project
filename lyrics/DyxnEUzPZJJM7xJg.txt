The sound of silent voices
Surveying my thoughts
Regularity defining perfection
Neither sorrow
Nor contentment
Whispering emptiness
Whispering emptiness

Frail words collapse
My weight only stirs the ground
How long can I hold your hand
As you walk over graves?
You search for tears
Of compassion
Yet find the comfort of winter
You found the comfort

Reassurance dead like the falling leaves
Losing hope in your unchanging ways
All of my strength can't save you
If you are unwilling to help yourself
