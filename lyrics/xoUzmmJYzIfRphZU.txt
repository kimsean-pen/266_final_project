I know you wanted me to keep my mouth shut
Because you hate it when I speak my mind
I suffer through it but it feels so messed up
Like my opinion is a waste of time

We never wanted it to be this way
They never listen to a word we say

So scream your heart out. You are the chosen
You gotta show them silence is the enemy
Tweet it out loud, we are the broken
We gotta show them silence is the enemy

You're taking needles and sow my mouth shut
But you will never hear the last of me
This is the reason that we're all so fucked up
You are the reason that we don't believe

We never wanted it to be this way
They never listen to a word we say

So scream your heart out. You are the chosen
You gotta show them silence is the enemy
Tweet it out loud, we are the broken
We gotta show them silence is the enemy

(Woa oh oh) Scream it out loud
(Woa oh oh) Silence is the enemy
(Woa oh oh) Scream it out loud
(Woa oh oh) Silence is the enemy

You gotta show them silence is the enemy

Scream your heart out. You are the chosen
You gotta show them silence is the enemy
Tweet it out loud, we are the broken
We gotta show them silence is the enemy
(Woa oh oh) Scream it out loud
(Woa oh oh) Silence is the enemy
(Woa oh oh) Scream it out loud
(Woa oh oh) Silence is the enemy
Scream it out loud!
Silence is the enemy
