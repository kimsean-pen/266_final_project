First time it crossed my mind
Second thoughts with my design
All I'm thinking it is breaking (?)
This time

You're just in time to see me
Kill a treasure VS Me
To a soldier smarter, bolder
Things have seem to gotten older
By design

Free gifts won't make this trip
Won't make it better when it starts to stick
You are silent suffering just in time to beat the fire (?)
By design

And time could fly by by the time it goes by
You know try to draw the shutters on the ground below
Watch it
Lazy comet lazy comet
Can't stop it
It's a lazy comet lazy comet
