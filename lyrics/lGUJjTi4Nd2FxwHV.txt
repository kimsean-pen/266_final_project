They say I'm heartless
And I got no soul
They say I'm too wild
And I can't be controlled
They say I'm loveless
But no body knows
I'm really terrified
That I'll die alone

All I ever seem to have are these one night friends
The only thing I know is this life of sin

Another lonely night
With someone in my bed
You think it's cool but what I won't do for love
And I just push away
The ones who get to close
Now I'm alone but what I won't do for love
What I won't do for love
What I won't do for love
What I won't do
What I won't do for love
What I won't do for love
What I won't do for love
What I won't do
What I won't do for love

And I'm restless
I'm just killing time
With these bodies
Cos I just can't find
Anybody
That makes me wanna stay
Until I find it
I'll be living this way

And I can achieve all of these things in my life
But it don't mean a thing with no one by your side

Another lonely night
With someone in my bed
You think it's cool but what I won't do for love
And I just push away
The ones who get to close
Now I'm alone but what I won't do for love
What I won't do for love
What I won't do for love
What I won't do
What I won't do for love
What I won't do for love
What I won't do for love
What I won't do
What I won't do for love
What I won't do
What I won't do for love
What I won't do
What I won't do for love

Another lonely night
With someone in my bed
You think it's cool but what I won't do for love
And I just push away
The ones who get to close
Now I'm alone but what I won't do for love
Another lonely night
With someone in my bed
You think it's cool but what I won't do for love
And I just push away
The ones who get to close
Now I'm alone but what I won't do for love
What I won't do for love
What I won't do for love
What I won't do
What I won't do for love
What I won't do for love
What I won't do for love
What I won't do
What I won't do for love
