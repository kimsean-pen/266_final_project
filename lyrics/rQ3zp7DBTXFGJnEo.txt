Seabirds fly the salty wind
East to South, North to West
See us go, as they go, across the borderlines

I can feel the fear hang heavy on the water
Glinting sharply with the pale moonlight
Mothers hold on tightly to your children
The waves are breaking violently tonight

Seabirds fly the salty wind
East to South, North to West
Can we go, as they go, across the borderlines?

I hear yelling, I hear crying, I hear praying
As the ocean threatens us on all four sides
The water rises deeper every minute
This vessel cannot bear the burden of our load

Seabirds fly the salty wind
East to South, North to West
Can we go, as they go, across the borderlines?

One by one the children have grown silent
From their mother's arms, they float away
The roaring sea will wash our quiet bodies
Upon the foreign shore, but our souls will find a way

And with seabirds fly the salty wind
East to South, North to West
See us go, as they go, across the borderlines

Seabirds fly the salty wind
East to South, North to West
See us go, as they go, across the borderlines

Seabirds fly the salty wind
East to South, North to West
See us go, as they go, across the borderlines

Seabirds fly the salty wind
East to South, North to West
See us go, as they go, across the borderlines

Seabirds fly the salty wind
East to South, North to West
See us go, as they go, across the borderlines

Seabirds fly the salty wind
East to South, North to West
See us go, as they go, across the borderlines
