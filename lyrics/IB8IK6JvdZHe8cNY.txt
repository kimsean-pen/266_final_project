What with everyone arriving here
We should celebrate another year
Go on dress up in your late night best
With your hair wet, we'll count a slow ten, while the screen's set
Loud enough for knocks on doors
We will welcome in they'll just ignore
When I find you pacing on the porch
If your friends ask, you caught a cab back, couldn't quite last

Come back empty
Here's to endings

Wondering when are we gonna learn
Everything that you need in reverse
Coming in, feel you touch when you turn
Moving full speed
Everyone that we know's growing up
Maybe so, honey old isn't love
And everything I could want is in front
Not behind me

We will wake into this morning's mess
Couches covered in our sleeping friends
When they wrote us off we rose again
And in your t-shirt, you feel the cold burn,
And say it's our turn

Come back empty
Here's to endings

Wondering when are we gonna learn
Everything that you need in reverse
Coming in, feel you touch when you turn
Moving full speed
Everyone that we know's growing up
Maybe so, honey old isn't love
And everything I could want is in front
Not behind me
We could take it back to when we touched down
I could make a bed against your floor

I could hear you talk over your faucet
Telling me the things you know for sure
Even if they hear us in the hallway
Listening for things we can't take back
I could put a hand upon your waist
Or we could waste the one thing that we have
'Til it's gone

Wondering when are we gonna learn
Everything that you need in reverse
Coming in, feel you touch when you turn
Moving full speed
Everyone that we know's growing up
Maybe so, honey old isn't love
And everything I could want is in front
Not behind me
