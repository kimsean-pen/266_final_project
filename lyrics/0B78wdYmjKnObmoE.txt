first time in a while that i haven't been bored
first time in a while i've been able to record
in bated breath i would open up the door
when you were cold i made sure you were alive

first time in a while that i haven't been online
first time in a while i took you by surprise
you took in all of it
that's what i like
there's a person i forgot about
it happens all the time

can you feel it deeper wrapped around your spine
to you then back to me
there's a secret we both keep
i was passionately on about it
know that you won't leave
you are you and i am me
2017...

i feel somehow i'm connected
i feel you for real and how you're so selective
baby don't push away
i said from the beginning
if i knock real slow
will you answer
no

i feel there's a separation
i'm not who i was in 2011
but i stay attuned to what you're really after
does your heart beat slow when i call you
no...
