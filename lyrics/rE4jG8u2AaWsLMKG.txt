Step one, I did it for fun
It was a simple way to start
Lights out, what's it all about?
I only got one cheek to turn
Some do it for the summit la cumbre,
Some do it for the climb
Some people know when to settle down
I can't help but wonder what's on the other side

I want love love love love love
Love love love love love
Love love love love love
All around me
All around me

Step two led to step three
Led to my heading home in a rush
Some kid won't admit what he did
Just say, "Hey Hail Mary, can't forgive and forget about it"
Some say they know it when they see it
While others follow it blind
Some science appliances made it all calculated
It's just a chemical imbalance in the weaker mind

I want love love love love love
Love love love love love
Love love love love love
All around me
All around me

Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooooh
I know something you don't know
I said, Hey hey hey hu-hu-hey hey
I'm not ever gonna give it away
I said, Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooooh
I know something you don't know
I said, Hey hey hey hu-hu-hey hey
I'm not ever gonna give it away

Step one, I did it for fun
It was a simple way to start
Some doors don't close anymore once you have opened up your heart
Some people gotta sell it
'Cause some people want to pay
Some people like to stand on a steeple and tell me,
"This is not the way, it's the wrong way!"

I want love love love love love
Love love love love love
Love love love love love
All around me
All around me
Love love love love love
Love love love love love
Love love love love love
All around me
All around me
