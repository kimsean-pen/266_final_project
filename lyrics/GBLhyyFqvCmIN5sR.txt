My nose is burning
Too much cocaine
Got caught in Brooklyn
With gasoline backed up with cellophane
I'm in need of moderation
Nah, I need a fucking break
'Cause I just railed down enough lines tonight
To spell your first and last name
I miss the ocean
And I know it's weird to say
I grew up then moved to LA
It's only thirty minutes
Four-oh-five to PCH
But half an hour feels forever and a fucking day

And it's all because I dreamt of you
And woke up alone
What a wonderful tone
To bring you back home

My soul is burning
Need Jesus Christ
My mom's unhappy with all the choices I been making with my life
I don't even fucking care though
I'm probably gonna die
Like everybody else
Is that such a fucking lie?
And I swear to God
If the alcohol and drugs don't kill me
I don't know what will
Other than you

And it's all because I dreamt of you
And woke up alone
And when friends hit my phone
All they want's a repost
It's all because I dreamt of you
And woke up alone
What a wonderful tone
To bring you back home
