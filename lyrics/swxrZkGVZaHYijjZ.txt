I always fear that I'm not living right
So I feel guilty when I go to church
The pastor tells me I've been saved, I'm fine
Then please explain to me why my chest still hurts

I spent four thousand on the Mart McFlys
Yet I'm still petrified of going broke
There's someone gorgeous in my bed tonight
Yet I'm still petrified that I'll die alone

I'm just so sick of being
Human
I'm just so sick of being
Human
I'm just so sick of being
Human
I'm just so sick of being

My mother calls I have no time to talk
But I can find the time to drink and smoke
Took 15 hits 'till I can barely walk
I threw up on the lawn, I can't find my phone

I got no nuts to tell the one I love
That she's the reason that I wrote this song
And that's some coward shit I know it sucks
But Lauren call me when you hear this on

I'm just so sick of being
Human
I'm just so sick of being
Human
I'm just so sick of being
Human
I'm just so sick of being

See I got GPS on my phone
And I can follow it to get home
If my location's never unknown
Then tell me why I still feel lost
Tell me why I still feel lost
See I got GPS on my phone
And I can follow it to get home
If my location's never unknown
Then tell me why I still feel lost
Tell me why I still feel lost

Tell me why I still feel lost
Tell me why I still feel
(Human, human, human, human)
