What would you do?
What would you say?
How does it feel?
Pretend it's OK
My eyes deceive me
But it's still the same
Pretend it's OK

I remember the day when we were out all night
I wish that I could get the day back and tell you it's all right
'Cause we all do the same thing
We just don't realise that we're living on borrowed time

What would you do?
What would you say?
How does it feel?
Pretend it's OK
My eyes deceive me
But it's still the same
Pretend it's OK

I see the light that I'm chasing, a memory but it's fading
When it's gone I'll be waiting, knowing it's too late (knowing it's too late)
Change the road that I walk in, now it's your soul that I'm caught in
And you're not hearing when I'm calling, calling your name

One breath, one step, one life, one heart
Two words, two eyes, new beginning, new start
Too deep, too narrow, too short, too wide
I'm better with you here by my side

What would you do?
What would you say?
How does it feel?
Pretend it's OK
My eyes deceive me
But it's still the same
Pretend it's OK

Nothing here, no one talking, knowing it's too late
But sometimes it can get so hard pretending it's OK
Nothing here, no one talking, nothing's gonna change
But sometimes it can get so hard pretending it's OK

What would you do? (what would you do?)
What would you say? (what would you say?)
How does it feel?
Pretend it's OK
My eyes deceive me
But it's still the same
Pretend it's OK

What would you do? (what would you do?)
What would you say? (what would you say?)
How does it feel?
Pretend it's OK
My eyes deceive me (what would you do?)
But it's still the same (what would you say?)
Pretend it's OK, oh, yeah
What would you do?
What would you say?
Pretending it's okay
What would you do?
What would you say?
