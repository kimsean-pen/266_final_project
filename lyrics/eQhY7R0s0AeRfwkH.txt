Can't get it in no magazine
Can't get it in no drama queen
Cause I am my only escape
Trying to get all comfortable
Cause nothing is the way it was
And I am my only escape

And I'm leaving for tomorrow
I don't wanna come back home and feel the same
My heart, it's all crazy
I think it's time to run away

So meet me at the wishing well
If my dreams are real, I can't tell
Cause I am my only escape
I was trying to do the best I could
Cause nothing is the way it was
And I am my only escape

And I'm leaving for tomorrow
I don't wanna come back home and feel the same
My heart, it's all crazy
I think it's time to run away

I am my only, I am my only
I am my only, I am my only escape
I am my only
I am my only, I am my only escape
