One, two, one...

We still believe in love, we still believe in truth
We know we still live and then die 'cause we still believe in you
Yeah, we still believe in the power of love, we're doing what we can
We're only gonna get some cosmic love and we all can jump inside
Riding in our horses, holding a balloon
We know that it's the future, so let's go for the moon

We're children of the moon, we're children of the moon
We're children of the moon

I wonder what they'll do when you tell them you've gone to the moon
I wonder what they'll do when you tell them you've gone to the moon
I wonder what they'll do when you tell them you've gone to the moon
I wonder what they'll do when you tell them you've gone to the moon
I wonder what they'll do when you tell them you've gone to the moon
