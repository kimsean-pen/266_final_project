Way out, wherever I've gone
Way in to somethin' more
Way out to taste the first dawn of the millenium
Turn down the sun-lit road
To my soul down a path of truth
Sing praise to the sky above
Become a Halleluiah

We are there, forever I'm gone
Stayin' here till the mornin come
Some things have always been, yeah those are the first to change
Those things I'd always feel, I let them slip away
Way back whenever that was, I'm feelin' bad again and you
You know yourself that it's strong, oh how I dream it could be true

We are there, forever We're gone
Stayin' here till salvation comes
Goin' away till the sun goes dark
And we'll feel it real, believe it's gonna be forever

No man, No man must go
No man must alone
All man, all man be free
All man to freedom come
Oh man, Oh man with a throne
Oh man with a throne of gold
Too late, too late to know
Too late to know enough

Out 'till the stars we gone
That's when it really went wrong
The morning partied till dawn
Like a new millenium
Changed the law and the deed was done
Now I'm back where I started from
And I'm on the run, I'm on the run, I'm back on the goddamn run

We are there, forever I'm gone
Stayin' here till salvation comes
Goin' away till the sun goes dark
You'll feel it real, and I believe in it forever

No man, No man must go
No man must alone
All man, all man be free
All man to freedom come
Oh man, Oh man with a throne
Oh man with a throne of gold
Too late, too late to know
Too late to know enough

Ghosts of my love come and haunt me every day
I see you in everything
Because of love everything is sad today
I see you in everything, oh
Ghosts of our love how you haunt me every day
haunt me every day
Ghosts of our love gonna haunt me night and day
Haunt me night and day, woah

No man, No man must go
No man must alone
All man, all man be free
All man to freedom come
Oh man, Oh man with a throne
Oh man with a throne of gold
Too late, too late to know
Too late to know enough
No man, No man must go
No man must alone
All man, all man be free
All man to freedom come
