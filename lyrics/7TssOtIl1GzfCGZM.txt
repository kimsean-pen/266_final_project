The knife of insight tore its way in me
A brash collision without sympathy
And maybe when the sun goes down
I'll come 'round, I'll come out
Maybe we could take some time
Unwind, figure out
When the knife of insight tore its way in me

Oh, hit me up if you're feeling down
Give a little, oh we'll figure this out
Keep me up, keep my mind around
After dark, after light
Let it go if you won't get loud
Make a little fuss, oh it's all allowed
Beautiful how it all pours out
After dark, after light
After dark, after light

Oh, the knife of insight brought me to my knees
Broke me down and taught me how to see
And I know, and I know, and
I know that maybe we should
Take some time, get this out, make this right
Maybe when the sun goes down
I'll come 'round, tell you all about
When the knife of insight brought me to my knees

Oh, hit me up if you're feeling down
Give a little, oh we'll figure this out
Keep me up, keep my mind around
After dark, after light
Let it go if you won't get loud
Spark a little, oh it's all allowed
Beautiful how it all pours out
After dark, after light
Whoa, after dark, after light
Oh, oh

And maybe I'm crazy, maybe you know
But I've got this feeling it's all 'bout to blow
Maybe I'm crazy, or maybe you know that
I've got this feeling it's all about to blow
When the knife, the knife, the knife
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, hit me up if you're feeling down
Give a little, oh we'll figure this out
Keep me up, keep my mind around
After dark, after light
Let it go if you won't get loud
Love a little, oh it's all allowed
Beautiful how it all pours out
After dark, after light
Oh, after dark, after light
After dark, after light
Oh, oh
Beautiful, down low
Oh it's all after dark

And the knife
Oh, the knife
Oh
