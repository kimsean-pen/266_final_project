Love
I get so lost sometimes

Days pass
And this emptiness fills my heart
When I want to run away
I drive off in my car

But whichever way I go
I come back to the place you are
All my instincts
They return

The grand façade
So soon will burn
Without a noise

Without my pride
I reach out from the inside
In your eyes
The light, the heat
I am complete
I see the doorway
To a thousand churches
The resolution
Of all the fruitless searches
Oh, I see the light and the heat
Oh, All I want to be that complete

All I want is touch the light
The heat I see in your eyes
Love
I don't like to see so much pain
So much wasted

And this moment keeps slipping away
I get so tired
Working so hard for our survival

I look to the time with you
To keep me awake and alive
And all my instincts
They return

And the grand façade
So soon will burn
Without a noise
Without my pride

I reach out from the inside
In your eyes, in your eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes

In your eyes
The light the heat

In your eyes
I am complete
In your eyes
I see the doorway
To a thousand churches
In your eyes
The resolution
In your eyes
Of all the fruitless searches
Oh, I see the light and the heat
In your eyes
Oh, I want to be that complete
I want to touch the light
The heat I see in your eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes
