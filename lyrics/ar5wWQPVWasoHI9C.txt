Big bag dont mean everything wavy
I got 99 problems like Jay Z
Caught a felony judge tried to slave me
Lost my grandmother RIP Mavy
I got money and niggas move shady
With my brother i put that on baby
My first car i might cop a Mercedes
In the stu everyday can't be lazy
Bodies drop all the time I don't feel nothing
Swear to god y'all gone make me go kill something
Told my shooters no mercy or chill button
I done been through so much I don't feel nothing
I was down off the drugs, had me tooted
I was locked in my cell 'bout to lose it
They be watching me clocking my movements
They be plotting on catching me snoozing
Bodies drop all the time I don't feel nothing
Swear to god y'all gone make me go kill something
Told my shooters no mercy or chill button
I done been through so much I don't feel nothing
I was down off the drugs, had me tooted
I was locked in my cell bout to lose it
They be watching me clocking my movements
They be plotting on catching me snoozing
I be shitting I make it look easy
I was innocent they ain't believe me
Ain't no lie I be seeing illusions
I can't figure who real it's confusing
I can't wait to get used to this lifestyle
I remember it could've been lights out
Bitches see me and scream lil TJay
Had to fuck up the spot for my bday
Hit the telly and catch me in BJ
Fuck this love I don't want me a skeezay
Give her dick now she feel like she need me
I'm too high always smoking on GG
Bankroll had to stack my chips
SB almost jacked my shit
I know these niggas gone hate me
I've been working hard driving me crazy
Big bag don't mean everything wavy

I got money and niggas move shady

My first car I might cop a Mercedes
At the stu every day can't be lazy
Bodies drop all the time I don't feel nothing
Swear to god y'all gone make me go kill something
Told my shootas no mercy or chill button
I done been through so much I don't feel nothing
I was down off the drugs, had me tooted

Dream big imma get to the top
Niggas waiting the tape bout to drop
Told my momma that I'm destined to pop
Y'all ain't think I would get what I got
But I stay true to myself
No losing myself
Improving myself
I'm on the road to the riches
Been asking the lord for forgiveness
I got two or three opps on the hitlist
Y'all be talking but they never did shit
You be better off minding your business
Hard headed I just don't like to listen
Mesclando I stay in the kitchen
Money coming and my palms is itching
Y'all niggas ain't no competition
Big bag don't mean everything wavy
I got 99 problems like Jay Z
