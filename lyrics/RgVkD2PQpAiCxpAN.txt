We're fighting without a reason
It's time to mend this great divide.

How did we get this far
How did this come to be
Why does fear dominate
When all we want is peace
We've got to find a way to heal
The wounds that we have bled
The empires fall
And rise again.

Save us, save us,
Save us, save us from ourselves
Now.

We're fighting without a reason
We're killing her softly day by day
We're guilty we're all in treason
It's time to mend this great divide.

We have to end the hate
And fight hypocrisy
We have to believe in life
And all humanity
Think of the children that have to live
In what we leave behind
The empires fall
And rise again.

Save us, save us,
Save us, save us from ourselves
Now.

We're fighting without a reason
We're killing her softly day by day
We're guilty we're all in treason
It's time to mend this great divide.

(Bridge)

Save us, save us,
Save us, save us from ourselves
Now.

We're fighting without a reason
We're killing her softly day by day
We're guilty we're all in treason
It's time to mend this great divide.
