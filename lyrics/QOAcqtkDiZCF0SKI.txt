It's the way I cross the line
It's the way I open
It's the way to my decline
It's the way I'm broken

It's the way I break my crime
It's they way I've stolen
It's the way I've learned to die
It's because I'm broken

Save me, lock me down, criminal
Catch me, hate me now, criminal
Chase me, drag me down, criminal
Trap me, stop me now, criminal
Hold me, chain me down, criminal
Keep me, judge me now, criminal
Watch me, break me down, criminal
Waste me, kill me now, criminal

It's the way I cross the line
It's the way I open
It's the way to my decline
It's the way I'm broken
