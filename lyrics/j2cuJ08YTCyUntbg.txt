Such a pretty face, radiant
I saw you, across the room, I knew I had to have you
Thus started the chase
I knew I would do anything to take your hand and make you mine

But I learned long ago
If you love someone you have to let it go, let it go, let it go
The hardest part of letting go
Is saying goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Fettered away in a makeshift cell
Beneath the venomous moonlight
I unleash my plan to watch you fail
The one I held so high

Go to sleep my love
And taste my sweet revenge on your lips
It's sealed with a kiss

I return to the masquerade ball
And leave the lone figure weeping
Stone by stone, immured in the wall
Forever left in safekeeping

Go to sleep my love
And taste my sweet revenge on your lips
It's sealed with a kiss

But I learned long ago
If you love someone you have to let it go, let it go, let it go
The hardest part of letting go
Is saying goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye...
Let it go...
