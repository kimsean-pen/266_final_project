Through distances of green
We move toward the sound
Is this moment as it seems
Always something is hidden
You said, I can't imagine â€“
What about now
What, dear one, about now
The ground's pulse
What time is here
Everything feels close
Something always is about to appear
In the rain see a new forest rise
Hand over heart at the sight
What, dear one, about now
