Oh, sometimes I just wanna run away
It's got too much, babe
I don't even know how, but I just fell out
God I'm rude, in the abyss I loom
So I'll just wonder
Show them what you're made of
Yeah, look out

I, I ain't giving up
Not that easy
I ain't gonna give up that easy

I realise that if I stay
Can make this go my way
Sometimes there are games to play
And I hate them, babe
Momma said, "What are you afraid of?"
Momma said, "Show them what you're made of"
Yeah, look out

I, I ain't giving up
Not that easy
I ain't gonna give up that easy
I, I ain't giving up
Not that easy
I ain't gonna give up that easy
Look out

Yeah, yeah
I, I ain't giving up
Not that easy
I ain't gonna give up that easy
I ain't gonna give up that easy, ooh
I ain't gonna give up that easy, ooh
