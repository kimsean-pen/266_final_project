If you're taken I am yours
I'm up and doing circles
I'm taken I am yours
I'm up and doing circles

I'm taken I am yours
I'm up and doing circles
I'm taken I am yours
I'm up and doing circles

I collapse I might stay out longer
Than I left the light on for you
Then if you show you show
If you show you show

When I feel like this
When I get so into myself
I lose track of where I'm going

And lose track of how to get going again
I feel myself slowing down
Feel myself turning around is this taken?

When I feel like this
When I get so sick of myself
Where are you going now without me?

And not knowing then that we're slowing down
You've gotta turn that around
And tell me that I'm taken tell me if I'm yours

You collapse the pressure of this life is so
You can't be held accountable
If you go you go if you go you go

When you act like this
When you get so sick of yourself
The whole world falls away and since I feel

Like I have only missed
The feeling that I'm here again
The feeling that I'm clear again I'm not taken

When you act like this
When you get so into yourself
I lose sight of common goals
And letting go so I can be all alone

Feel myself going slow
Feel myself letting go
Not taken not feeling like I'm yours

I'm taken I am yours
I'm up and doing circles
I'm taken I am yours
I'm up and doing circles

I'm taken I am yours
I'm up and doing circles
I'm taken I am yours
I'm up and doing circles

I collapse this life looks like a sentence though
A constant game of falling short
If you know you know if you know you know

When I feel like this
When I'm just so sick
Of feeling less than perfect
Is it right for me?

I never fight to see if coming clean would get to me
I feel myself holding back
I feel the pressure it's finally back I'm taken

When you feel like this
When you saw it call come crashing down
Subtle but not underground

I was there I saw the signs I saw unfair
And so I write to you through other means
I let myself finally feel taken like I was yours

If you're taken I am yours
I'm up and doing circles
I'm taken I am yours
I'm up and doing circles

I'm taken I am yours
I'm up and doing circles
I'm taken I am yours
I'm up and doing circles

I'm taken I am yours
I'm up and doing circles
I'm taken I am yours
I'm up and doing circles

I'm taken I am yours
I'm up and doing circles
I'm taken I am yours
I'm up and doing circles

I'm taken I am yours
I'm up and doing circles
I'm taken I am yours
I'm up and doing circles

I collapse
I collapse
I collapse
