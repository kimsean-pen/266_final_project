I'm so rushed off my feet
Looking for Gordon Street
So much I need to say
I'm sorry that it's on her wedding day

Cos she's so right for me
Her daddy disagrees
He's always hated me
Because I never got a J-O-B

Cos she's mine

And I'm glad I crashed the wedding
It's better than regretting
I could have been a loser kid
Who ran away and hid But it's the best thing that I ever did

True love lasts forever
And now we're back together
Its as if he never met her
So we came back
I'm glad I crashed the wedding

The neighbours spread the word
And my mom cried when she heard
I'd stole my girl away
From everybody gathered there that day

Just in time

And I'm glad I crashed the wedding
It's better than regretting
I could have been a loser kid
Who ran away and hid
I said I'd do it and I did

True love lasts forever
And now we're back together
Its as if he never met her
So we came back
I'm glad I crashed the wedding

Don't wish she's being
Mad at me for taking her away
Cos anyway she didn't wanna stay
So please believe me when I say

She's glad I crashed the wedding
It's better than regretting
The ring she got was lame
She couldn't take the pain
She didn't wanna silly second name

True love lasts forever
And now we're back together
He might aswell forget her
And walk away
She's glad I crashed the wedding

It's better than regretting
The ring she got was lame
She couldn't take the pain
She didn't wanna silly second name

True love lasts forever
And now we're back together
He might aswell forget her
And walk away
She's glad I crashed the wedding
