Before you feel like everything's gone wrong
Let's laugh and sing and think about this song
Yeah think about this song
Yeah think about this song
Yeah think about this song

Before you feel like everything's gone wrong
Let's laugh and sing and think about this song
Yeah think about this song
Yeah think about this song

Can't you see the sunlight
Can't you see it's moving on
Even in the darkest hours
Can't you see there's someone
Don't you feel the love
Can't you feel the love

Even when you feel just like the sky is falling down
You've got it right
And all you've got to do in times so hard you fall apart
Is let them pass by

So give it what you want
And then give it what you want
And then give it what you want
And then give it what you want

And all you've got to do is just to make it past this
You've got to make it past this
You've got to make it

Can't you see the sunlight
Can't you see it's moving on
Even in the darkest hours
Can't you see there's someone
Don't you feel this love
Can't you feel this love
Can't you feel this love

Before you feel like everything's gone wrong
Let's laugh and sing and think about this song
Yeah think about this song
Yeah think about this song
Yeah think about this song
