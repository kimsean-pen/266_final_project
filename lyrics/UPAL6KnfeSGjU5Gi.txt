I know I
Live a life that won't change
For some time
I've felt, well, quite strange
I haven't cried for a year
I don't prize myself for my ill health
That starts to loom

An empty room
Is now my doom

My past has gone
Well I know this was not what I wanted
My head was clear not in fear of habbit
And guilt never took control
Well I lost a soul to my blues
A long time ago
A long time ago
