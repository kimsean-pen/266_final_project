This black cat infection is spreading mad fast
Look at that, from simple symptoms to hazmat
Don't ask that 'cause stupid questions get laughed at
We clap back at the white boy, hands off and that's that

Don't keep quiet, just keep lying and to the beat
California kind of fever throwing up the threes
The art of war harbour hate like a reservoir
Bomb threats like like market value was never good

Middle finger to the face, that's our point of view
Middle finger to the face, that's our point of view
But every time they tell a lie and they point at you
Middle finger to the face, that's our point of view

So now we running through the city like a marathon
Yeah, that's right, bitch, we put that firebomb
Temper on, taking lessons from Lethal Weapons
But after lesson is a full reflection of our perceptions

You hear the message, so tell me now are we getting through?
Incarcerate us and cage us, they're making nothing new
For every time that they tell a lie and they point at you
Middle finger to the face, that's our point of view

Middle finger to the face, that's our point of view
Middle finger to the face, that's our point of view
But every time they tell a lie and they point at you
Middle finger to the face, fuck y'all

Middle finger to the face, that's our point of view
Middle finger to the face, that's our point of view
But every time they tell a lie and they point at you
Middle finger to the face, that's our point of view

We ain't speaking in tongues, shit
But you're tongue tied
What? You're afraid?
Y'all afraid of that?
