If I could tear you from the ceiling
And guarantee a source divine
Rid you of possessions fleeting
Remain your funny valentine

Don't go and leave me
And please don't drive me blind
Don't go and leave me
And please don't drive me blind

If I could tear you from the ceiling
I know best have tried
I'd fill your every breath with meaning
And find a place we both could hide

Don't go and leave me
And please don't drive me blind
Don't go and leave me
And please don't drive me blind

You don't believe me
But you do this every time
Please don't drive me blind
Please don't drive me blind

I know you're broken
I know you're broken
I know you're broken

If I could tear you from the ceiling
I'd freeze us both in time
And find a brand new way of seeing
Your eyes forever glued to mine

Don't go and leave me
And please don't drive me blind
Don't go and leave me
And please don't drive me blind
Please don't drive me blind
Please don't drive me blind
Please don't drive me blind
Please don't drive me blind
