can't afford flowers
But if I could
I'd not know where to plant them
I don't know species
I'd probably sneeze
But rest assured
If I could I'd weep a bunch once a week...

My very first car
I bought from you for a dollar
It's still on lay-buy
I would pay by any means that you could take
It drove me further
Than I had dared to dream
We spoke at length
When you said to "fly away" and fly I did

I didn't mean to miss your funeral
But like you said, I've got to sing from my heart
Your words like whispers written on my skin
And I wear your silver suit
That you gave my mother away in as I sing.

Dear headmaster,
Irreverent pupil would like to venture
Some advice if he might
Learn to spell your own name
Before you give it away
It makes things easier
When you climb down the family tree
To get to me

You led a protest
Right to the ending
Ending up where you started by the water
I hope you're swimming
I hope you're swimming
I hope you're spinning
In orbit of the stars I'd like to chase...
