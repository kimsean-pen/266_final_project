I feel I wanna hold you, wanna tell you that you'll be alright
Sang this song today, it's recalling your pictures all in my mind
I miss you now
I miss you now

Although we're getting old now my old friends gonna leave me and die
I'm helpless, it's gonna get us before we get this
wanna kiss you goodbye
I miss you now
I miss you now
I miss you now

I feel I wanna hold you, wanna tell you that you'll be alright
I'm helpless, it's gonna get us before we get this
I wanna kiss you goodbye
I miss you now
I miss you now
I miss you now
