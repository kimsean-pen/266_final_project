How come that it is so good, yet so bad
Yet so good, yet so dangerous? Yes, yes, no
In the morning we don't know where you are, but I trust as I always do
In the afternoon, I just can't trust. you are who, you are who
In the night I don't want to know you are right, I don't need to know but I want
Yet I don't, and I trust, yes I trust, oh I trust as I always do
