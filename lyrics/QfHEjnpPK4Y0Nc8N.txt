Oh, it's safe to say I knew it,
Yeah I knew it all along.
Asking the same questions,
Singing the same songs.
I've been gone for a while,
Been traveling alone,
Searching for a new life
When I already had my own.

So I walk back home,
On every road.

On every road
We cross alone
We're thinking of those we left back home
So follow the lines
And I'll be your guide
'Cause we're the lucky ones
On Every Road

Yeah it's safe to say I knew,
That all the selfish things I do,
Would eventually come creeping back around.
Way back when,
You called me young
Said we're innocent and dumb
I knew that you'd come creeping back around again.

So walk back home,
On every road.

On every road
We cross alone
We're thinking of those we left back home
So follow the lines
And I'll be your guide
'Cause we're the lucky ones
On Every Road

So walk back home,
On every road.

On every road
We cross alone
We're thinking of those we left back home
So follow the lines
And I'll be your guide
'Cause we're the lucky ones
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

On every road
We cross alone
We're thinking of those we left back home
So follow the lines
And I'll be your guide
'Cause we're the lucky ones
(So lucky, baby)

On every road
We cross alone
We're thinking of those we left back home
So follow the lines
And I'll be your guide
'Cause we're the lucky ones
On Every Road
