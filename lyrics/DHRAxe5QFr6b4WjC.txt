When your day is long
And the night, the night is yours alone
When youre sure youve had enough
Of this life, well hang on

Dont let yourself go
Cause everybody cries
And everybody hurts, sometimes

Sometimes everything is wrong
Now its time to sing along
When you day is night alone, hold on
If you feel like letting go, hold on
If you think youve had too much
Of this life, well hang on

Cause everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts
Dont throw your hand, oh no, oh no

Dont throw your hand
If you feel like youre alone
No, no, no you are not alone

If youre on your own
In this life, the days and nights are long
When you think youve had too much
Of this life, to hang on

Well everybody hurts, sometimes
And everybody cries
Everybody hurts, sometimes

So hold onhold on
