There's no use to pretend
We have come to the end
All that's left is to say goodbye
If I hold you with lies
It will show in my eyes
All that's left is to say goodbye
So when you go I won't stop you
But I will remember
How deep, how beautiful it was
And all this beauty of love that was our love
And now leaves me sad
I don't want to deny, don't want to betray
Don't want to forget
Because my love in my life
You have been like a day full of sun

So when you go I won't stop you
But I will remember
How deep, how beautiful it was
And all this beauty of love that was our love
And now leaves me sad
I don't want to deny, don't want to betray
Don't want to forget
Because my love in my life, you have been
Like a day full of sun
