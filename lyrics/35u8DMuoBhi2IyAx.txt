Eyes roll up, you can't even tell me my name
I'm your guard, you can't even tell me the same
You're so feckless, Im so sorry
Time's so reckless with our bodies

1, 2, 3, 4, tell her that you love her more
5, 6, 7, 8, no more time, dont be late

I'll be kind, you're trying to hold on your heart
But I'm on one bite tomorrow take all of your clothes

I'm so taughtless, I'm so sorry
Time's been reckless with your body
(Time's so reckless... with our bodies)

It's not like to break this dawn
We've been in the dark for a while
Step into the blankets and piteous smiles

And the world you know is gone
I can be good if you want, I can be kind if you prefer
(She can be good if you want)
I can be kind if you prefer

I'll unplug, find where the wire meets the world
You stay calm, I'll hold it happily though

Call me heartless, side-girl complex
We're too honest, we're too modest

You're so feckless, I'm so sorry
Time's been reckless with your body
