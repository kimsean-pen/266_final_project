Well, I'm a-runnin' down the road
Tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind
Four that want to own me,
Two that want to stone me
One said she's a friend of mine

Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own
Wheels drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can
Don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand and
Take it easy

Well, I'm a-standin' on the corner
In Winslow, Arizona
With such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me

Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I've got to know if your
Sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose and we may win
But we will never be here again
So open up, I'm climbin' in to take it easy

Well, I'm a-runnin' down the road
Tryin' to loosen my load
Got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover
Who won't blow my cover
She's just a little hard to find

Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me

Ooh ooh ooh
Oh we got it easy
We oughta take it easy
