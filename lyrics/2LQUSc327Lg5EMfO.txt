Over the horizon lies the prize
Infinite explosions in her eyes
Only the impossible dreams
Can bring her alive

Oh carry me
Leave no traces behind

And it's a way to keep me
Sailing through the night
Sailing through the fires with
Impossible dreams
It's a way to keep me flailing
Dancing while I'm drowning with
My Impossible Dreams

Trails of misfortune lead the way
Traces of past lives gone astray
Only the impossible dreams
Can bring her alive

Oh carry me
Leave no traces behind

And it's a way to keep me
Sailing through the night
Sailing through the fires with
Impossible dreams
It's a way to keep me flailing
Dancing while I'm drowning with
My Impossible Dreams

Over the horizon lies the prize
Infinite explosions in her eyes
