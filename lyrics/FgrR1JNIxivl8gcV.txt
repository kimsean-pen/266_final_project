Reconcile with accuracy
In agreement with menstruation
A reptile being of hits
Simpleton, simpleton

The horror of my clothes is standing up
The face on this body is going far
So be it if your character actually sucks
My secret doesn't have the wholesome stuff
Wash my hands shorty

Adding to the alphabet
With the penalized [?]
This is civilization
Without a third person

I have little knowledge of the surprise
In a box with a skeleton, take its eyes
Believe me when I tell you that you're makin' me try
But you don't have to let me know you hate my design
Wash my hands shorty

The horror of my clothes is standing up
The face on this body is going far
So be it if your character actually sucks
My secret doesn't have the wholesome stuff
Wash my hands shorty
