Yes it's really over now
You're so good at letting me down
Why you even tryna fight?
We've been here a million times

So I'm putting on my favorite dress
That you are gonna miss
And never see again

Yes it's really over now
You're so good at letting me down

So I'ma buy a bottle of the best
Champagne
I'ma raise a glass all to myself
In your name
And I'ma cry if I want to
It's my party without you
Here's to all the pain
Champagne

I would always scream your name
You were never fun to hate no, no-o
Us and liquor never mixed
Something I will never miss
Now

So I'm putting on my favorite dress
That you are gonna miss
And never see again

Yes it's really over now
You're so good at letting me down

So I'ma buy a bottle of the best
Champagne
I'ma raise a glass all to myself
In your name
And I'ma cry if I want to
It's my party without you
Here's to all the pain
Champagne

Champagne

So I'm putting on my favorite dress
That you are gonna miss
And never see again

Yes it's really over now
You're so good at letting me down

So I'ma buy a bottle of the best
Champagne
I'ma raise a glass all to myself
In your name
And I'ma cry if I want to
It's my party without you
Here's to all the pain
Champagne

Champagne
Here's to all the pain
Here's to all the pain
