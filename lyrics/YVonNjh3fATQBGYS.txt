All faith corroded
Your fate within my hands
I will not need the help from onlookers and the weak
Their purpose has gone

And I promise you that this
Will be our final resting place
Your breath will fade away
And I promise you that this
Will be our final resting place
Are we so broken that we won't last?

Open the flood gates
Don't close your eyes
This will be ephemeral
If you don't take this chance
This door will close

We will play our parts
Yet tearing at us
We will know that this is a disappointment
Every little detail ruined by your cold hate
This is disappointment

And I promise this
Will be our final resting place
Your breath will fade away
And I promise you that this
Will last forever
Our years have never looked so good
How can we rest while the fires burn outside?
I am pulled down with the weight of the broken
I will fall
Our souls burn
