Now
Your heroes have fallen.
Championless
The seas are rising.
So torch every banner
Every hope of surviving.
This storm is breaking.

Security has left you
Treading water.
Now taste the fear.
Taste the uncertainty.
What will you do?
When there's nothing left for you to cling to.
What will you do

with your one last breathe?
Thrive in your emptiness.
Burn all you love.

There's no hope for the weak.

Our heroes have died.
No Heart,
No Hope.
Face to face
with the Abyss (with the Abyss)
One by one
They fall away

and won't be missed.

Can you hear it?
Can you hear the sound?
As our broken Idols
Come crashing down.
Now taste the fear.
Now, taste, the, fear.
Burn all you love.
There's no hope for the weak.
Our Heroes have died.
Burn all you love.
There's no hope for the weak.
Burn all you love.
