In search of marbles long since misplaced
I give in... to yet another day...

Sheltered from revealing light
Kept out of sight
Where sick minds bite
Institutionalized
I sleepwalk through my life
The years pass by like fimbulwinter seasons

Inside a darkness I do not own
A bright portal void shows me where I long
It's out of reach you see
The piping pills set no one free
Here I stand glued in blood
I just want to belong

Nailed by some cruel device
Leave me be
The void is me yeah I know you see:
"Ambition is the last refuge of failure"

Every step a dead end street
Must power up get me on my feet
I've frozen space and time
To warp alive inside my mind
There is no place like home
I just want to belong
