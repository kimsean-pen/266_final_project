Crashing through the airport
Realization came completely
To the pilot who was flying
Blinded by the sirens

Of the waves washing away at sunset
All the dreams to save are ones that
Keep the lightbulb burning straight ahead

So don't, don't think lover
Love it lasts forever

Hanging from a collapsing rooftop
Jumping through an open window
Driving to the endless light
Keeps the car from crashing

The reflection in the mirror's a bad day
Everything turns out the wrong way
Waiting for the storm to tear it down

Don't, don't think lover
Love it lasts forever
Don't don't think lover
Love it lasts forever
