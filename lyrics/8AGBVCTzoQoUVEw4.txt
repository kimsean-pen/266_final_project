broken, bitter pain
rotting to free a soul of rage
that tore into the sun
promising us a new age of love

this dream is going grey
but then again it's never too late
trust the mystery, you'll never solve everything

Jackie my true love
i would give you anything
but you don't need a thing
to live through this dream
