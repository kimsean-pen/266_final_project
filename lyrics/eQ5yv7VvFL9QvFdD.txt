Show me who we are today 'cause I'd like to say that I think we're falling out
Run down in the pouring rain and I can't complain
But I'm tired, oh yeah, and I've tried far too many times

There's been just a couple things that I'd like to bring the attention to the crowd
The way that your tongue creates all the brilliant lies
And besides those eyes, there's not much you can hide

(Chorus)
Light it up, tear it down, these walls are still burning
Pull you close, call me out, I'm losing control
You were mine and now you're gone
I know I've got to give in, so hear me out
I'm feeling fine but I just want you to know, you're not alone

I pretend that I like the way that your promises never seem to stay
I realize we could compromise but you never will
And my head starts to drop
'cause there's some things that we should talk about before we cut each other out
I'm trying to figure out where do we go

Light it up, tear it down, these walls are still burning
Pull you close, call me out, I'm losing control

You were mine and now you're gone
I know I've got to give in, so hear me out
I'm feeling fine but I just want you to know, you're not alone

I'm trying to figure out where do we go from here
I'm tired of burning out, I'm burning out

Light it up, tear it down, these walls are still burning
Pull you close, call me out, I'm losing control

Light it up, tear it down, these walls are still burning
Pull you close, call me out, I'm losing control
You were mine and now you're gone
I know I've got to give in, so hear me out
I'm feeling fine but I just want you to know, you're not alone

You're not alone
I just want you to know, you're not alone
You're not alone
I just want you to know, you're not alone
