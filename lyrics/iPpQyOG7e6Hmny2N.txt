Let me be absolutely clear
This is mine but I'll let you in
Gather round take a part of it, of me, of me
A wasted life seems to mean the most
But these seconds are valuable
Breathe in change or let it go and breathe

Emergency, help
Emergency, help
Emergency

The medicine is killing me
I won't lay down, I won't give in
The medicine is killing me
some pieces have gone missing

Oh, I'll give you something to think about
Oh, I'll give you something to think about

Please sign on the dotted line
Those thoughts are not required
But you're all fucking vampires to me, to me
Emergency, help
Emergency

The medicine is killing me
I won't lay down, I won't give in
The medicine is killing me
Some pieces have gone missing

Oh, I'll give you something to think about
Oh, I'll give you something to think about
Oh, I'll give you something to think about
Oh yeah, I'll give you something to think about
Yeah-ooh

The medicine is killing me
I won't lay down I won't give in
The medicine is killing me
Some pieces have gone missing
Some pieces have gone missing
Some pieces have gone missing
The medicine is killing me
I won't lay down I won't give in
The medicine is killing me
Some pieces have gone missing
Oh hey, I'll give you something to think about
The medicine is killing me
I'll give you something to think about
Some pieces have gone missing
