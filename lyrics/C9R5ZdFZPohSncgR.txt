Break the skin,
'cause I can't tell where your body ends and mine begins...
Tear the flesh,
I woke today feeling like some kind of masochist...

You manifest,
you bring things to be,
yeah, your mojo witchcraft, honey, it's working on me,

I must confess,
pull, beg, and plead,
that I need your kiss like the ocean needs a breeze...

(Oh),
I go off like a gun,
like a loaded weapon,
bang, bang, bang,
grip me in your hands...
So here we go again,
it echoes in my head,
bang, bang, bang,
grip me in your hands...

So I can feel you here with me...

Soaked in sin,
baptized by your kiss and now I'm born again...
Bite your lip,
wrap my hands around your head and pull you in...

I can't catch my breath,
sleep, think, or speak,
yeah, your mojo witchcraft, honey, it's working on me,

so let's make a mess,
tear up the sheets,
every whisper you speak sends a shiver through me...

(Oh),
I go off like a gun,
like a loaded weapon,
bang, bang, bang,
grip me in your hands...
So here we go again,
it echoes in my head,
bang, bang, bang,
grip me in your hands...

(Oh),
I go off like a gun,
like a loaded weapon,
bang, bang, bang,
grip me in your hands...
So here we go again,
it echoes in my head,
bang, bang, bang,
grip me in your hands...

So I can feel you here with me...
(Tear the flesh),
So I can feel you here with me...
(Break the skin),
So I can feel you near me...
(Tear the flesh),
So I'll make sure you hear me...

(Oh),
I go off like a gun,
like a loaded weapon,
bang, bang, bang,
grip me in your hands...
So here we go again,
it echoes in my head,
bang, bang, bang,
grip me in your hands...

(Oh),
I go off like a gun,
like a loaded weapon,
bang, bang, bang,
grip me in your hands...
So here we go again,
it echoes in my head,
bang, bang, bang,
grip me in your hands...

Bang, bang, bang,
grip me in your hands...
Bang, bang, bang,
grip me in your hands...
