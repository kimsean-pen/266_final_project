What is my destination
Spinning too fast, I can't slow down
I lose my head when you're around, yeah

Don't tell me to run away from this
Cause you've got the love I can't resist
How can I breathe
How should I feel
(Can't hold me back)

Baby what you do, what you do, what you do to me
Makes me want to be somebody I'm not
Every time you do, what you do, what you do to me
Take your chance boy, ready or not

Baby what you do, what you do, what you do to me
Makes me want to be somebody I'm not
Every time you do, what you do, what you do to me
Take your chance boy ready, ready or not

I'm longing for inspiration
Somehow you turn me inside out
I need an explanation now, right now

Don't tell me to run away from this
Cause you've got the love I can't resist
How can I breathe
How should I feel
(Can't hold me back)

Baby what you do, what you do, what you do to me
Makes me want to be somebody I'm not
Every time you do, what you do, what you do to me
Take your chance boy, ready or not

Baby what you do, what you do, what you do to me
Makes me want to be somebody I'm not
Every time you do, what you do, what you do to me
Take your chance boy ready, ready or not

Baby what you do, what you do, what you do to me
Makes me want to be somebody I'm not
Every time you do, what you do, what you do to me

Take your chance boy ready, ready or not
Baby what you do, what you do, what you do to me
Makes me want to be somebody I'm not
Every time you do, what you do, what you do to me
Take your chance boy ready, ready or not
