Mmm, oh oh oh, yeah

Pour tequila in my wine
Now I'm feeling fine
I wanna waste your time
Like you wasted mine
You walk into the party
I see you in my peripheral
Trying not to stare at you
Is motherfucking difficult

What am I feeling?
I'm staring at the ceiling
Don't wanna let you know I want you
That's just too revealing I-
So I-I, I might (I might)

Imma mix these drinks till you're out of focus
So I don't even notice
Imma mix these drinks till it's blurry vision
So I won't know you did it
Pour tequila in my wine
Now I'm feeling fine
I wanna waste your time
Like you wasted mine
Imma mix these drinks till you're out of focus
So I don't even notice

Wine in my tequila
I just wanna feel ya
That might be hard to do
Since I don't wanna see ya
I want you but I don't
Yeah I don't even understand myself
I just had to sit here, trying hard to think of something else

What am I feeling?
Don't know how much I'm drinking
Don't wanna let you know I want you
That's just too appealing for ya
For ya, for ya, for ya
So I might (I might)

Imma mix these drinks till you're out of focus
So I don't even notice
Imma mix these drinks till it's blurry vision
So I won't know you did it
Pour tequila in my wine
Now I'm feeling fine
I wanna waste your time
Like you wasted mine
Imma mix these drinks till you're out of focus
So I don't even notice

I can't seem to let you go, so
I'm just gonna pour some more
I don't wanna let it show, so
I'm just gonna pour some more

What am I feeling?
I'm staring at the ceiling
Don't wanna let you know I want you
That's just too revealing I-
So I-I, I might (I might)

Imma mix these drinks till you're out of focus
So I don't even notice
Imma mix these drinks till it's blurry vision
So I won't know you did it
Pour tequila in my wine
Now I'm feeling fine
I wanna waste your time
Like you wasted mine
Imma mix these drinks till you're out of focus
So I don't even notice
