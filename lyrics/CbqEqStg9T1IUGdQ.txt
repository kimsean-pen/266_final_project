One last chance, one more try
One last work straight through the night
One more cry, one last fit
Do or die, and getting sick
Uh-oh, you're gonna put yourself in the corner
Uh-oh, you've gone and done it wrong again
Listen close, make it quick
Overflow their heads with shit
Spit it out, make a scene
Wonder why they shit on me?
Uh-oh, you're gonna put yourself in the corner
Uh-oh, you've gone and done it wrong again
At the top is only one way down
There's one way down
There's one way down
At the top you've got a bigger mouth to feed
At the top there's only one way down
There's one way out
No doubt about it
At the top you've got a bigger head to feed
When in doubt, when in need
There's no time to disagree
With yourself when you scheme
All you are is kerosene
Uh-oh, you're gonna put yourself in the corner
Uh-oh, you've gone and done it wrong again
At the top is only one way down
There's one way down
There's one way down
At the top you've got a bigger mouth to feed
At the top is only one way down
There's one way out
No doubt about it
At the top you've got a bigger head to feed
To feed
Feed
Feed
If you want it
Go and get it
Reputation
Adulation
Expectation
Complications
The temptation
Isolation
