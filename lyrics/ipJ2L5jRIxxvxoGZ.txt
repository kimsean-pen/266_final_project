Last 30 seconds I wait for him
Last 30 seconds I wait for him
To begin
To begin

Last 30 seconds I wait for him
Last 30 seconds I wait for him
To begin

The nights are getting longer
The pain is getting stronger,
But I know
ooo...
I know

The hate is getting darker
And the fear is growing larger,
But I know,
ooo...
I know

You taught me that my heart would grow old
You taught me that my heart would grow old...
old...
old...

You taught me that my heart would grow old
You taught me that my heart would grow old...
old...
old...

Last 30 seconds I watch you go
Last 30 seconds I watch you go
All alone
All alone

Last 30 seconds I watch you go
Last 30 seconds I watch you go
All alone
All alone

The nights are getting longer
The pain is getting stronger,
But I know
ooo...
I know

The hate is getting darker
And the fear is growing larger,
But I know,
ooo...
I know

You taught me that my heart would grow old
You taught me that my heart would grow old...
old...
old...

You taught me that my heart would grow old
You taught me that my heart would grow old...
old...
old...

The fear of my identity
Is standing right in front of me.
I want to run, but I can't see.
I want to scream, but I can't speak.

The fear of my identity
Is standing right in front of me.
I want to run, but I can't see.
I want it to be you, but I know it's me.
