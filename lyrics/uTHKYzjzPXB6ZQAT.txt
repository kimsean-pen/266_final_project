Don't rely on me
You know these things happen

It's a
It's a
It's a one in a million
It's a single drop in the ocean
And then we all disintegrate

And we don't have time
Cause time is a hook on a line
And we're swimming for our whole lives
Trying to survive

They don't
They don't
They don't know anything
They never seem to know anything
Or maybe they won't say

It's impossible
What I dream of

I wanna be with you alone
(Just you and I)
I wanna be with you alone
Oh but I
I wanna be with you alone
(Wish I could've stayed)
I wanna be with you alone

I know we don't want anything to happen
But we don't always get what we want
No we don't always get what we want

When you leave
We say bye-bye

It's impossible
What I dream of

I wanna be with you alone
(Just you and I)
I wanna be with you alone
Oh but I
I wanna be with you alone
(Wish I could've stayed)
I wanna be with you alone
