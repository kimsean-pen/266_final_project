(Verse)
On a street corner I see you
On park bench somewhere sleeps
My brothers and sisters, redemption's on its way
How can you lose a fight that you make?

(Chorus)
'Cause in your eyes
You chasing planes in your eyes
So you feel weakness in your eyes
Don't lose the passion in your eyes
You made love famous in your eyes
I feel the dream in your eyes
It's laced in your eyes
In your eyes I see the dream
In your eyes
It's laced in your eyes

(Verse)
Mothers and fathers
We're flying with no pilots to lead the way
We need direction to land in a clear space
Or we will crash
End up in flames
But I know you won't let us go

(Chorus)
'Cause in your eyes
You chasing planes in your eyes
So you feel weakness in your eyes
Don't lose the passion in your eyes
You made love famous in your eyes
I feel the dream in your eyes
It's laced in your eyes
In your eyes I see the dream
In your eyes
It's laced in your eyes

(Interlude)
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

(Chorus)
'Cause in your eyes
You chasing planes in your eyes
So you feel weakness in your eyes
Don't lose the passion in your eyes
You made love famous in your eyes
I feel the dream in your eyes
It's laced in your eyes
In your eyes I see the dream
In your eyes
It's laced in your eyes

(Interlude)
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
