In this place co-op space I can't stand another man around my oxygen
I know I hate myself and probably everybody else
In this taste the right taste when you wish
That they would welcome you with open arms
I know I hate heartbreak and I want to be there when it caves

So why do I always feel like I'm not someone sabotage myself

One car garage, I'm not waking up
I've taped it up to go
Where I feel like no one else is watching
One car garage, am I giving up
I'm tangled up in hope
But I feel like someone else's coffin

I dissipate and I'm late
I've got people on the other side of holy gates
I know I hate myself and probably everybody else
But I've got some reasons why I feel like I'm alone in a solo show
I'm a broken home
And I want my body gone but I don't want to hurt no one

So why do I always feel like I'm not someone sabotage myself

One car garage, I'm not waking up
I've taped it up to go
Where I feel like no one else is watching
One car garage, am I giving up
I'm tangled up in hope
But I feel like someone else's coffin

I smile feel it, I sink and sleep
I'm giving in but it's not enough
I'm not enough

And I can't last another minute in a broken tomb
I know I hate myself and probably everybody else

One car garage, I'm not waking up
I've taped it up to go
Where I feel like no one else is watching
One car garage, am I giving up
I'm tangled up in hope
But I feel like someone else's coffin
