You can close your eyes it's over now.
It's over now,
You can close your eyes it's over.

Baby, baby, baby,
Make a wish.
Tell me have, you ever been afraid like this?
(It's over now)

I've seen it watching me,
That misty thing,
Without a face.
It weaves my thoughts,
Lined them up in black lace.
It buries my shape,
And leaves no trace.

Tomorrow I will have no shame,
And I will start again.
Make a wish.
Tell me have, you ever felt alone like this.
(Over now)

Better do it sure.
Just wishing,
I could move in some more.

Tomorrow I will have no shame,
And I will start again.
Make a wish.
(You can close your eyes it's over now)
Baby I, have never been afraid like this.
(You can close your eyes it's over now)
Make a wish.

I took off my shoes,
I took off my face,
And then I undid, the buttons on my dress.
(I will start again)

Make a wish.
(You can close your eyes it's over now)
Tell me have, you ever been exposed like this?
(You can look into your mind)
Baby, baby, baby,
Feels like a kiss.
(You can close your eyes and start again)
I bet, you never thought that I could feel like this

Tomorrow I will have no shame.
Tomorrow I will have no shame.
Make a wish.
