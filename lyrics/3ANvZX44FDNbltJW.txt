Hoping for the pin to drop
'Cause I can't hold it all
Trying to correct the wrongs
Say when, say when
Better luck now that you're on your own
So don't just lie there
Hoping for the pin to drop
Say when, say when

Keep counting all the fresh starts we've had
I'll raise another white flag, so that
We keep counting all the fresh starts we've had
I'll fly another white flag over us

No time to bow down
No time to kill
No justifying
Staying down in silence
No time to bow down
No time to kill
We stay between the white lines

No time to bow down
No time to kill
No justifying
Staying down in silence
No time to bow down
No time to kill
We stay between the white lines

Hoping for a stroke of luck
But one you're counting on
Trying to deflect a wave
Say when, say when
What do you have, and what do you want
Are you still stuck here
Hoping for a stroke of luck?
Say when, say when

Keep counting all the fresh starts we've had
I'll raise another white flag, so that
We keep counting all the fresh starts we've had
I'll fly another white flag over us

No time to bow down
No time to kill
No justifying
Staying down in silence
No time to bow down
No time to kill
We stay between the white lines

No time to bow down
No time to kill
No justifying
Staying down in silence
No time to bow down
No time to kill
We stay between the white lines

Changing focus
Stay in silence
Changing focus
Stay in silence
Changing focus

No time to bow down
No time to kill (Stay in silence)
No justifying
Staying down in silence (Changing focus)
No time to bow down
No time to kill (Stay in silence)
We stay between the white lines

No time to bow down
No time to kill
No justifying
Staying down in silence
No time to bow down
No time to kill
We stay between the white lines

No time to bow down
No time to kill
No justifying
Staying down in silence
No time to bow down
No time to kill
We stay between the white lines

The white lines
Between the white lines
White lines
