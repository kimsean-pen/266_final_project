There's a guilt
Deep within
In divine soil
Blossomed into sins
Reaps foundations
A burning hand
Leads my fingers

I touch through skin
Damage everything
Misadventure
And I
Cut through time
Drifting in these crimes
Misadventure

Do you hear me?

Don't come close
It's taking over
Grown in hope
Withered by trauma
