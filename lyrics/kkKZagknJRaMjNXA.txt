When hearts collide
The blood will flow
To end the pain
I'll let you go

How is it I know
Where you've gone
For so long
Hollow is my ghost
That will haunt
What you've done

Into the light
We'll rust to dust
Clarity feels
As clear as us

How is it I know
Where you've gone
For so long
Hollow is my ghost
That will haunt
What you've done
