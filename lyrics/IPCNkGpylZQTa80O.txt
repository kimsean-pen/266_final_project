Hang on for the ride
I think I feel a change of tide
Just stay for one more night
One day you're gonna be my wife
You'll never have to worry again
I'm gonna be your man

Oh oh someday,
when tall boys turn into champagne,
when bologna turns into stake,
when I got gold instead of change,
when I can give everything you ever wanted instead of take,
oh someday

I wish you could depend on me
I wanna have your mouth to feed
I wanna put your mind at ease
No reason to ever leave
You and I can both be free
Well, things ain't so cool right now
Well, I promise they'll get better
Find anyway somehow that make you wanna stay forever

Oh oh someday,
when tall boys turn into champagne,
when bologna turns into steak,
when I got gold instead of change,
when I can give everything you ever wanted instead of take,
oh someday

When I can give everything you ever wanted instead of take,
oh someday.
I wish you could depend on me
I wanna have your mouth to feed
I wanna put your mind at ease
No reason to ever leave
You and I can both be free
Well, things ain't so cool right now
Well, I promise they'll get better
Find anyway somehow, that make you wanna stay forever

Oh oh someday,
when tall boys turn into champagne,
when bologna turns into steak,
when I got gold instead of change,
when I can give everything you ever wanted instead of take,
oh...

When I can give everything you ever wanted instead of take, oh someday.

Ain't knowing for the ride
I think I feel a change of time
Just stay for one more night
One day you're gonna be my wife

Oh oh someday,
when tall boys turn into champagne,
when bologna turns into steak,
when I got gold instead of change,
when I can give everything you ever wanted instead of take,
oh someday.
