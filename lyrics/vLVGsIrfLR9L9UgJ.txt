Lady dressed in gold
She is young, she is old
She's the keeper of the soul
She's called death

Takes you in her arms
Like a child to a mother
She's your sister, she's your borther
She is death

She's knocking at your door
Don't have to run no more
This day I knew was coming
Wasted all my years with all of my fears
And everything didn't mean nothing

Lady dressed in gold
She is young, she is old
She's the keeper of the soul
She's called death

Takes you in her arms
Like a child to a mother
She's your sister, she's your borther
She is death

There's no use in fighting
Doesn't matter if you're hiding
Cause she is there when there's nothing left
Only longs for your last breath
She's in me and she's in you
She is waiting for that kiss that will let you go

Lady dressed in gold
She is young, she is old
She's the keeper of the soul
She's called death

Takes you in her arms
Like a child to a mother
She's your sister, she's your borther
She is death

Didn't you know?
Cause everybody knows it
When the time comes
The lady comes for you
To take you home

Cause everybody knows it
When the time comes
The lady comes for you
Oh, didn't you know?

She's keeping score
(She's keeping score)
She's getting more
(She's getting more)
She's dressed in gold
(She's dressed in gold)
That's what I'm told
(That's what I'm told)

Creature of the night
Hidden plain in your sight
Her wings are coloured black
There's no turning back
