There's a dark room inside of my head
Developing images I'd rather forget
You laced your tongue with a poison
And it makes me remember
Every night I look out my window
Afraid you might return for more
I miss your frozen love too much
And I'd overdose from just a touch
So, baby don't come back

Oh, whatever you do
Don't come back for me
After all I've bled for you
I can hardly breathe
And one more kiss
Could take my life

There's a fire inside of my bed
Made of coals that I deeply regret
Oh, you left me burning with the embers
And I barely made it out alive

Oh, whatever you do
Don't come back for me
After all I've bled for you
I can hardly breathe

Oh, you're back inside my dreams
Broken bones and empty screams
Sleepless nights in burning sheets
Lightning strikes inside my eyes
Tell me is this love alive
Tell me now or set me free

Oh, whatever you do
Don't come back for me
After all I've bled for you
I can hardly breathe
And one more kiss
Could take my life
