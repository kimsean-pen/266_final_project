Oh Lord,
won't you listen in to me now?
Oh Love,
I got to get me back to you somehow
I never knew that life was loaded
I'd only hung around birds and bees
I never knew that things exploded
I only found it out
When I was down upon my knees
Looking for my life

Oh boy,
you've no idea what I've been through
Oh Lord,
I feel so stuck that I can't get to You
Had no idea that I was heading
Toward a state of emergency
I had no fear where I was treading
I only found it out
When I was down upon my knees
Looking for my life

Caught up on me with intensity
Had no idea where I was heading
I only found it out
When I was down upon my knees
Looking for my life

Oh boys,
You don't have idea where I've been through
Oh Lord,
I got to get back somehow to You
I never knew that life was loaded
I'd only hung around birds and bees
I never knew that things exploded
I only found it out
When I was down upon my knees
Looking for my life

I never got any G.C.E.s
I never knew that things exploded
I only found it out
When I was down upon my knees
Looking for my life
