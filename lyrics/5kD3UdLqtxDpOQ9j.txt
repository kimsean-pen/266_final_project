Money, power, pussy, fame; it don't mean nothing
Never feel an ounce of shame, it don't mean nothing
Tell me what you came before you came to this Earth
Tell me who you worshipped before they came with the church

I don't want no artificial
I don't flaunt no artificial
I don't need no articial
I don't

Artificial ends, at the age to seperate the homies from the friends
When shit hit the fan and show you blood from the kin
And my family always kept a tool by the lamp
Druggies getting started, it's party 4 AM
Everybody need me now,
knee-high to grasshopper, but the family always looking up the hill
Put the city on my shoulders, put my baby on my shoulders
Now it's [?], I can't get a break from nothing
I might smoke a whole eighth, then mush my whole face inside some blow
(Still I can't feel nothing)
You know I'm gon' hurt you for you
know it, 'fore you love me you should go
Tell me what you want from me
Oh you know I'm psychic,
I don'tI like it when you try to hide the hoax
'Cause we ain't got shit in common
We ain't got shit in common, tell me why the fuck you 'round me

I don't want no artificial
I don't flaunt no artificial
I don't need no articial
I don't, flaunt no
(Artificial ends)

I beat the Sun in the morning
I make you stop what you doing and turn into an employee
He be busy with the W9
I ain't picky, I just know what I like
Ain't no nigga really fuckin' with
I, always got it in the back of my mind
I prefer to keep them thoughts to myself
Execution over explanation
How come what I'm doin' help the
family and all the other shit is unrelated
Oh, ok, I like what you did there
I might vanish then reappear
When you cut the fugazi shit
You really should be yourself
I know that ain't saying much, but you don't be saying shit
I spent my life turning pain into power
I keep a reservation on a cloud
Whole rotation knocking them down
Hope gave birth to all this hype
I just might leave this world tonight
But for the life of me, I don't know why all these niggas around
You not my partner, not my homie, not my bro (hell nah)
Feel like you know me, yeah I know, and no you don't
Pastor knocked me out the church
I just pray all my niggas float
Higher voices take control
These niggas really don't want no smoke

I don't want no artificial
I don't flaunt no artificial
I don't need no articial
I don't, flaunt no
(Artificial ends)
(Artificial ends)
I don't want no artificial
I don't flaunt no artificial
I don't need no artificial
I don't, flaunt no
(Artificial ends)
