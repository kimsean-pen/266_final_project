You say it's time to stay behind
All I wanted was to hold you
All I wanted was to touch you

There's no need for blame
'Cause we're not the same
All I wanted was to love you
That's all I wanted

How many times will it take?
You're hurting me the way you do
How many times till I break?
You're hurting me the way I'm loving you the way I do

It's not so strange
For us to change
All I wanted was to touch you
That's all I wanted

How many times will it take?
You're hurting me the way you do
How many times till I break?
You're hurting me the way I'm loving you the way I do

All I wanted was to hold you
All I wanted was to touch you
All I wanted was to love you that's all I wanted

All I wanted was to hold you
All I wanted was to touch you
All I wanted was to love you that's all I wanted

That's all I wanted
That's all I wanted
That's all I wanted
