I can't forget the things you have done
You chose your way
This price you shall pay
Our time has just begun
Hold your tongue, no more lying / It's my turn to speak
Fist clenched in the darkness / This cut goes too deep

Dead Rose
My heart filled with pain
Dead Rose
My head filled with hate

I won't forget the things you have done
Death is real, no more hiding
Can you feel it's embrace?
Tired of watching you dying
Your mind lost it's way

Dead Rose
My heart filled with pain
Dead Rose
My head filled with hate
No More
When nothing's the same
Dead Rose
You withered away and now it's time to say goodnight
Father, why have you cursed me with this pain?
Your son has shed his skin
Brother, I lost my way within the darkness
Buried in roses
