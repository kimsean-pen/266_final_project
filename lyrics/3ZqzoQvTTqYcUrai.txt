Sin ti, amor no me paro
Siento que sale caro
Estar sin
Sin tu amor

Me siento como un veterano
Tal vez nunca le ganó
Empiezo a
Desvanecer

So come on baby run with me
Sing this simple melody
I can't get you off my mind

We were always meant to be
You're my ocean, you're my sea
You're my push, play and rewind

Everyday
Every night
Every time you make it alright

Gotta stay cool
Gotta get high
Living my la-la-la-la-life

Everyday
Every night
Every time we're saying goodbye

Wanna play cool
Wanna get high
Living my la-la-la-la-life

Ya soy como un faro
No ver me sale raro
A ciegas
Mi corazón

Ven y toma mi mano
Mi alma está en reparo
Empieza
A renacer

So come on baby run with me
Sing this simple melody
I can't get you off my mind

We were always meant to be
You're my ocean, you're my sea
You're my push, play and rewind

Everyday
Every night
Every time you make it alright

Gotta stay cool
Gotta get high
Living my la-la-la-la-life

Everyday
Every night
Every time we're saying goodbye

Wanna play cool
Wanna get high
Living my la-la-la-la-life

Everyday
Every night
Every time you make it alright

Gotta stay cool
Gotta get high
Living my la-la-la-la-life

Everyday
Every night
Every time we're saying goodbye

Wanna play cool
Wanna get high
Living my la-la-la-la-life
