The mountains surrounding
Mark the boundaries you're not meant to leave
I'll stay far away
But to keep my place
I want to write our names on a culm bank's face

Our hands only shake when we cross state lines
I've made hundreds of mistakes
And peace with dying in my sleep
That's what's right for me
While the kids back home will leap
To the riverbeds below Market Street

The mountains surrounding
Haunt the boundaries only mentally
Never set free
You know where I'll be
There's a time a place
When and where they'll bury me

Our hands only shake when we cross state lines
I've made hundreds of mistakes
And peace with dying in my sleep
That's what's right for me
While the kids back home will leap
To the riverbeds below Market Street
