Sometimes i grow so cold, my breath is an arctic wind
I am a mountain out of reach
Oh why? but sometimes i'm the night
I get tangled in the dark

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh but when we dance
Ooh ooh but when you take my hand
Oh when you take my hand

If i belong to somewhere, it's to your arms, kery
The love i hold is older than the sky we lay under
The reason why is hidden in our eyes
If i lose track of it, help me find my way back

When i was younger, sometimes when i look back
I see that aching heart, but i was fly, i was so tall
I wouldn't stop 'til i broke your heart
Ooh ooh i'm just like you
But you're a song i wanna sing all night long

If i belong to somewhere, it's to your arms, kery
The love i hold is older than the sky we lay under
The reason why is hidden in our eyes
If i lose track of it, help me find my way back

And you're the evening star
You want summer and i'm a winterheart
I'm the night now but i will shelter you
Oh the wind dies, the thunder of the storm is coming
(the storm is coming, the storm is coming)
Oh

If i belong to somewhere, it's to your arms, kery (kery oh)
The love i hold is older than the sky we (lay under)
Is older than the sky we lay under (eyes)
If i lose track of it, help me find my way back
