Do you see me?
Do you care?
You talk about me
Like I'm not there
Don't get a word in
When you're around
I bet you don't know
What I'm about

Yes I will
I will
Speak for myself
What you see
Isn't all I am
I need a place to stand
I will
I will
Speak for myself
There's so much you're missing
If you cared you'd listen

You suffocate me
You drown me out
I'm tired of waiting
Without a doubt
I feel I'm fading
I flicker out
My heart is screaming
Without a sound

Yes I will
I will
Speak for myself
What you see
Isn't all I am
I need a place to stand
I will
I will
Speak for myself
There's so much you're missing
If you cared you'd listen

I'm not sorry for who I am
Take it or leave it
It's my time to take a stand
Throw it or keep it
Now that I don't need to understand
Won't say it again

You know I will

Yes I will
I will
Speak for myself
What you see
Isn't all I am
I need a place to stand
I will
You know I will
(I will)
Speak for myself
There's so much you're missing
(So much you're missing)
If you cared you'd listen
If you cared you'd listen
I will
I will
Speak for myself
