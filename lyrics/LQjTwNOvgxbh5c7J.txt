If I ran ahead, would you know which way that I went without you?
In days, I would be lost and afloat
Thrown into the waves, tossed ashore
Throw me now your arms

We're not meant to be on our own
And is this now the time we let go
And cling to one another, giving life?
And throw me now your arms

Let me be the first to tell you
I would give up my life
Every day as the tides grow closer
It is all that's on my mind

Throw me now your arms and pull me in
Let me be the one at day's end
Who you can depend on, hand in hand
Safely on the shore where we stand
And throw me now your arms

Let me be the first to tell you
I would give up my life
Every day as the tides grow closer
It is all that's on my mind
