People moving every day
But you know they move so slow
Do they know where they are going?
Do they know why they go?
Look into your book of rules
and tell me what you see
Are you all that different?
Are you just the same as me?

Waiting for 1989
We don't want no more war
Waiting for 1989
We don't want no more war

Love is slipping away
It slips away so fast
I always thought
that it would last and it would last
Look into your book of rules
and tell me what you see
Am I all that different?
Are you just the same as me?

Waiting for 1989
We don't want no more war
Waiting for 1989
We don't want no more war
Right!

I'm waiting for 1989
We don't want no more war
Waiting for 1989, yeah
Gonna get right out and shut that door.
