Man, be careful with a fool. you know, someday he may get smart
Man, be careful with a fool. you know, someday he may get smart
He will treat you so cool and chilly, till he hurt you to your heart

Yeah, you know

Hate to remember, oh, what a fool I used to be, ha, ha!
Man, I hate to remember how foolish I used to be
The way I used to love you, baby, how bad it's gonna be

You know, I used to cry 'bout you, baby, ha!
You know, I'd-a walk the streets a-late at night
Used to cry about ya, a-walk the streets, a-late at night

If you love me just a little bit, baby, why in the world don't you treat me right?

Ah, yeah
Oh, yeah

Yeah!
Yeah!

Ah!

Yeah, baby!

Uh, fin'lly over, baby, whoa, I believe this is the end, ah, ah, yeah, well!
Fin'lly over, baby, oh, I believe this-a is the end, ah
I want to tell you my baby, to forgive me for my sin
