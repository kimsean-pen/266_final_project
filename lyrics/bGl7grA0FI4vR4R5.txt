Just like the spread of disease
Debt and guilt or guilt and decree
The masters that we please
Yet if we seek help for infirmities
We are made twice the sons of hell as before

Reach out your hand
Reach out your hand
Only to be plagued by disease
Reach out your hand
Eeach out your hand
Only to be plagued by disease

While religion tries to blame what we cannot see
I accept that part of the problem is me
It was never a sacred mandate to accept conformity
Through select revelations that we choose to believe
Another blind guide replacing divine eyes

Familiarity is the great deception
Disguised by authority, sealing out subversion

Whitewashed tombs have hidden the truth
For we unknowingly worship icons of ordinary life

Reach out your hand to find forgiveness
Only to be plagued by disease
The horrors of beliefs and customs
Camouflaged by commonality

Reach out your hand
Reach out your hand
Reach out your hand
Reach out your hand

I still believe that there is hope for us
But I believe we must look outside
The sanctuaries of oppression
That have brought our world so much pain
Yeah
Another blind guide replacing divine eyes
Whitewashed tombs (whitewashed tombs) have hidden the truth

Reach out your hand to find forgiveness
Only to be plagued by disease (plagued by disease)
Reach out your hand to find forgiveness (reach out your hand)
Only to be plagued by disease
Reach out your hand
Reach out your hand
