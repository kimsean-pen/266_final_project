5 a.m., rise and shine
To feed the baby before he starts to cry
No rest and time to play
15, the mother is a runaway

No time for dreams or goals
Pressure is so strong
Her body she has sold
So her child can eat

What is happening
To this world we live in
In our home and other lands

Drugs and crime spreadin' on the streets
People can't find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today
State of the world

Lil' Johnny all alone
His only friend, the doll he carries with him
Goes to school each and everyday
To be teased because he has no place to stay

This young and homeless boy feels his life is worthless
Instead of suicide he cries himself to sleep
And it's happenin' to this world we live in
There's got to be a better way

Drugs and crime spreadin' on the streets
People can't find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today
State of the world

Nation

Can't give up hope now
Let's weather the storm together

Drugs and crime spreadin' on the streets
People can't find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today

Drugs and crime spreadin' on the streets
People can't find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today

Drugs and crime spreadin' on the streets
People can't find enough to eat
Now our kids can't go out and play
That's the state of the world today

That's the state of the world today
That's the state
That's the state of the world today
