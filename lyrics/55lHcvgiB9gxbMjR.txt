Remember the time you said, "Son, it'll be alright"?
Remember the time you said, "Son, it will be just fine"?
Well, I'm waiting for the day that my mind says it's had enough
& I pray that day comes soon so I can finally feel loved

I just wanna feel loved
I just wanna feel loved

Remember the time I said, "God, I'm ready to die"?
Remember the time I said, "God, just take my life"?
Remember the time that I cried every single night?
& everything about myself was out of spice

Sick joke, sick joke, that's all I'll ever be to anyone
Sick joke, sick joke, that's all you'll ever be to anyone
I'm nothing but sick & disgusting
I'm nothing but sick & disgusting

God, I don't know if I'll ever be ready to die
God, I'm too much of a coward to give You my life
& I know that I'm still gonna cry every single night
But if you want me, I'm gonna stay here & fight

'Til you say, "Son, your heart is mine"
Dad, I don't wanna be sick & disgusting
Daddy, I don't wanna be sick & disgusting
Dad, I don't wanna be sick & disgusting
Dad, I don't wanna be sick & disgusting
