Go shoot your m-16
Go shoot your m-16
Go shoot your m-16

i'm not going to live your american dream!
Army life is right for me
Kill to save democracy
Got a rebel in my sights money's worth more than his life.
So kill. . .it's fun!
Shoot him!
You're better than him
Shoot him!
In the eye
Shoot him!
It gives you as thrill
Just like as a kid only now it's for real
Army life is right for me
Kill to save democracy
Got a rebel in my sights money's worth more than his life
So kill. . .it's fun!
