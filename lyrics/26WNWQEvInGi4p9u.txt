In the sun we are found
To be reflections of a sound

I know it? s been far too long
In stormy weather
My arrested hope won? t choke forever
Like a memory, I needed never

We walk wrapped in thought
Some are vacant, some have grown too short
It? s the only thing I? ve ever had
That keeps me lonely

In the sun we are found
To be reflections of a sound
When nobody is around

In the sun we are found
To be reflections of a sound
When nobody is around

Come down from the waste of time
Feel so empty when I feel so fine
Starting over we could change
This light shadow sober

I? ve been waiting for far too long
Let? s stick together
? Coz you? re keeping me warm
But it? s a lonely setting sun

In the sun we are found
To be reflections of a sound
When nobody is around

In the sun we are found
To be reflections of a sound
When nobody is around

I wait so long
Now my head is full of pressure
I need time to cure my mind
It? s like a loop that lasts forever

I? ve been waiting for far too long
Let? s stick together
? Coz you? re keeping me warm
But it? s a lonely setting sun

In the sun we are found
To be reflections of a sound
When nobody is around

In the sun we are found
To be reflections of a sound
When nobody is around

In the sun we are found
To be reflections of a sound
For nobody

In the sun we are found
To be reflections of a sound
For nobody
