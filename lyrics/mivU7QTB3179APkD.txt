Out to lunch
Speak your piece
Good and drunk
Back on the street

What you see is what you get
No matter what you say
No time for anything
To take the pain away

You sure ain't the chosen few
I know you turned a trick or two
You pulled the deuce this time
Another perfect day

Golden boy
Take a chance
You're a clockwork toy
You're a dime, a dance

The truth is only black and white
No shades of grey
It's easy answers, babe
There's a Hell to pay

You know it's just the same for you
Ain't nothing you can do
No chance to change it now
Another perfect day

Total war
Blow your stack
Say no more
You know you can't go back

You're acting dumb, babe, you don't know
The places you can go
You know you tell the truth
In a different way

No court of law would fight for you
No matter what you do
Could be the perfect crime
Another perfect day
