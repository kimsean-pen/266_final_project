You always found
You always found your escape

I was fighting for love
A love you abandoned
Turned your back on heavens gates
Became blind to the end that awaits
And I can't pretend
That we're born with a destination
The end will find me

Full eclipse
Fade to black
Heaven sent
The end attacks
Running from the only promise made
I'm still counting down the fucking days

Abandon
Abandoned

And you can try to make things up
But lost time was just way too much
A sentenced revoked from choices you've made
You've taken your chances
You won't be saved

The sky rains tonight
Pick your fucking side
And rain brings fear
The end is tonight

The rain brings fear
And it burns my skin
You always found your way out
There's no escaping this
The sky rains eternal
And it burns my skin
