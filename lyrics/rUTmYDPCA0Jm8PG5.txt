Found someone who can comfort me, but there are always exceptions
And she's good at appearing sane, but I just want you to know
She's the one makes me feel so good, when everything is against me
Picks me up when I'm feeling down, so I've got something to show

Staring at empty pages, centered 'round the same old plot
Staring at empty pages, flowing along the ages

Often lost and forgotten, the vagueness and the mud
I've been thinking I'm working too hard, but I got something to show

Staring at empty pages, centered 'round the same old plot
Staring at empty pages, flowing along the ages

Staring at empty pages, centered 'round the same old plot
Staring at empty pages, flowing along the ages

Often lost and forgotten, the vagueness and the mud
I'd been thinking I'm working too hard, but I got something to show
Your love
Found someone who can comfort me, but there are always exceptions
