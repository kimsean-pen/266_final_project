"He pained, shifting his attention toward the mirror across the road
Back into his daydream
The spliff burned his fingers the second he drank
And he tossed it toward the gutter.
The smoke burned into his eyes, blinding him
As he blinked through the tears
The pain began to recede
Back down the promenade and homeward bound
As he approached the intersection of Brooklyn and Lakeshore
A flock of geese burst from the darkness
And flew shrieking into what was left of the daylight

In a dark tunnel
And new dawn approaching
With a sphere of light
Ever glowing

And then the world will know
Will know of you
Of all things love
Of all things true

He looked up to watch them form a ghostly shoggoth
With flashes of white from their exposed chest
Blinking like so many eyes
Crossing the street drenched him in fluorescent light
And he quickened his pace
Until he reached the softer light of the street

Let it go as it grows on forever
And let it go
Let it go as it grows
Breathe it in
Let it go as it grows on forever
And we breathe it in
And we breathe it in

And then the world will grow
And then the world will grow
And then the world will know
Of all true love, true
