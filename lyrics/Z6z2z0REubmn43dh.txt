How sweet
You are
When you want
You can be like a field of sunflowers
Trust me
I will take
You somehwere
You could bloom

Life seems so strange
Then one day
You happen to meet her soul
And it is the best way to live again

Past the way
No infatuation
Do anything
With you

How sweet
You are
When you want
You can be like a field of sunflowers
Trust me
I will take
You somehwere
You could bloom

Past the way
No infatuation
Do anything
With you

When I see you there
Time stands still
With tenderness, with passion
And slowly we blend
