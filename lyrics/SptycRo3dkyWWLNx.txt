Hey you know comfort kills the spirit
And life will choke you slowly if you fear it

And we don't care
We never feel as good as when we make believe
And we don't dare
We tell ourselves there's nothing to achieve
Just wanna have some fun before we leave

We got koka-kola veins - we don't know our names
Bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
We got koka-kola veins - we don't use our brains
Bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
We got koka-kola pumpin' through our veins

We never messed around with discipline
We got our own jihad if you know what I mean

Hey you know baby we smile to keep from cryin'
You know it's way too late to start tryin'
