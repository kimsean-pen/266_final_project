The birds can't lie with my collar in my teeth
No one knows you like no one knows me
Wait for a day, you will never, never know the way
How it feels

I'll be your man
I'll be your man
I'll be your man
I'll be your man

Walking hand in hand by the side of the road
Heaven knows what we could have been
But somehow we wait and a little bit falls away
Do you feel?

I'll be your man
I'll be your man
I'll be your man
I'll be your man

In the day, I can be your lover
In the night, these words are true
And we wait, wait forever
For night, I can find

Why don't you wait
Won't you tell me what it is
Do you feel?

I'll be your man
I'll be your man
I'll be your man
I'll be your man
