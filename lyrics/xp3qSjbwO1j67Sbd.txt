Just counting the hours
'Cause when your bed it's made
Then, baby, it's too late, yeah

There's no hope for a hungry child
Whose joker is wild
They take all hope away
By the end of the day
Well, I just about had enough of the sunshine

Hey!
(Hey!)
What did I hear you say?
You know
It doesn't have to be that way!
You!
(You!)
When you walk out the door
(You walk out the door)
You gotta ask for more
(You gotta ask for more)
You gotta ask for more

It doesn't have to hurt that way
Just counting the pain
You've only got yourselves to blame
For playing the game

There's no hope for a hungry child
(No wonder!)
Whose joker is wild
And they take all hope away
(No wonder!)
And I just can't see the sense
And my mind's a haze
(No wonder!)
Ooh, and I just about had enough of the sunshine

Hey!
(Hey!)
What did I hear you say?
You know
It doesn't have to be that way!
You!
(You!)
When you walk out the door, baby
(You walk out the door)
You gotta ask for more
(You gotta ask for more)
From society
Take a tip from me now, yeah

Do you want it?
Do you want it?
Don't you know that I got it, baby?
(If you want)
Do you want it?
Don't you know I got it, baby?

Do you want it?
Do you want it?
Ooh, and I just about had enough of the sunshine

Hey!
(Hey!)
What did I hear you say?
(What did I hear you say?)
You know
It doesn't have to be that way!
You!
When you walk out the door
(When you walk out that door)
Ooh, you better ask for more
Baby, baby, baby

Hey!
(Hey!)
What did I hear you say?
You know
It doesn't have to be that way
You!
When you walk out the door, baby
You gotta ask for more
(You gotta ask for more)
You gotta ask for more

I said hey, oh-oh
(Hey!)
What did I hear you say?
You know
It doesn't have to be that way
You!
When you walk out the door, baby
(You walk out the door)
You gotta ask for more
(You gotta ask for more)
You gotta ask for more
For more
