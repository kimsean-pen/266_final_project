Hooy
here comes that man again
something in the way he moves
makes me sorry. I am a lady.

Hello stranger
you're a danger to the law and order here
they don't like men like you in our city.
You're too pretty cool and witty
you're a real bad company

I should have stayed away from you today.

Sorry I'm a lady
sorry I'm a lady
I would rather be
rather be
just a little shady
just a little shady
naughty dynamite
dynamite.
Sorry I'm a lady
sorry I'm a lady
have you got a light

got a light
for me tonight.

I need power
I need passion
give me more than sympathy
I've got a lot to learn before tomorrow

like a flower wants a shower
I want you to make me bloom
those gentlemen in grey can hear me say.

Sorry I'm a lady
sorry I'm a lady
I would rather be
rather be
just a little shady
just a little shady
naughty dynamite
dynamite.
Sorry I'm a lady

sorry I'm a lady
have you got a light
got a light
for me tonight.

You're a winner I'm a sinner
no excuse
no alibi
temptations won the game
and you are to blame.

Sorry I'm a lady
sorry I'm a lady
I would rather be
rather be
just a little shady
just a little shady
naughty dynamite
dynamite.
Sorry I'm a lady
sorry I'm a lady
have you got a light
got a light
for me tonight.
night
(fades)
