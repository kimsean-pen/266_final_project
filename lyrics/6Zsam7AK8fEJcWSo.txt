Black turns beat me bright
Turning on the light
Today is gonna be the day

You hear somebody say
We need you wide awake
Tiptoe over the floor
What are you waiting for?

So so and no more
That's all to be, so before
Today is gonna be the day
You hear somebody say

We need you wide awake
You hear the moments kick and play
The order of the day
Is already in your way

The window shade
The nurse and maid
To let it all just work away
From head to toe
Where shadow grows
Since forever and a day
Quiet moments home
Where some do you roam?

Today is gonna be the day
You hear somebody say
We need you right away
No time for tea or lemonade
Someone to set the day
Were only half awake
Drink a toast to the sun
To the things that never come
To the break of the day
That is all that I say
