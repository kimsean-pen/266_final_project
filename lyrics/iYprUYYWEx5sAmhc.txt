Here's one for my old man
I know I ain't got your name on my hand yet
But I will
You know that I will
Do you remember saying that you'd stretch your ear so much bigger than mine
But you ain't got the time
And you gave up
I guess that I won
I jumped a flight of stairs
Because I knew you were waiting there
I jumped a flight of stairs because I was so excited to have you home
Do you remember I took you out on the town
You fell to the ground and make that sound we do
My friends just don't get it
Do you remember when you left my friends
You went off on your own and missed your ride home
You missed out
Mum couldn't find you
I jumped a flight of stairs
Because I knew you were waiting there
I jumped a flight of stairs because I was excited to have you home
It doesn't matter that we can't get drunk Dad
It doesn't mean that we can't have fun
We can go out for a couple, or maybe a few
It wasn't getting drunk I loved it was being with you
It doesn't matter that we can't get drunk Dad
It doesn't mean that we can't have fun
We can go out for a couple, or maybe a few
It wasn't getting drunk I loved it was being with you
