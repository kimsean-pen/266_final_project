I've been driving all night and Devil by my side
I used to call him Jekyll, now I call him Hyde
Teeth like granite, fingers of gold
I were getting ugly or I were getting old?

Sugar, sugar, sugar - you look so mean
Honey, honey, honey - drinking gasoline
(I don't know, it's magic
It's really magic)

I'm a teenage rock god, teenage rock god
All the freaks come worship me
Teenage rock god, teenage rock god
All the freaks are in love with me

I'm gonna eat some speed, hammer on the gas
Moody, loony killer gonna get some ass
Slide you top down, crawl across the bed
In Pennsylvania where love is all she said

Sugar, sugar, sugar - you look so mean
Honey, honey, honey - drinking gasoline
(I don't know, it's magic
It's really magic)

I'm a teenage rock god, teenage rock god
All the freaks come worship me
Teenage rock god, teenage rock god
All the freaks are in love with me
