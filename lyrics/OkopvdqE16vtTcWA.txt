Brian, tender kisses run run run is my wish for you
Brian, tender drops of blood run run run I'm thinking of you
How far does your brother go with you?
Brian, growing boy stay stay stay awake is my prayer for you
Brian, tender clutches run run run I'm thinking of you
What happens to you when your dad
Hears your brother pull down your underpants?
