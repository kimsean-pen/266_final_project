One, two, three, four

Well, every highway that I go down seems to be longer
Than the last one that I knew about, oh, well

And every girl that I walk around seems to be more of an illusion
Than the last one that I found, oh, well

And this old man in front of me wearing canes and ruby rings
Is like containing an explosion when he sings
And with every chance to set himself on fire
He just ends up doin' the same thing

Well, each beautiful thing I come across tells me
To stop moving and shake this riddle off, oh, well

And there was a time when all I wanted was my ice cream colder
And a little cream soda, oh, well, oh, well

And a wooden box and an alley full
of rocks was all I had to care about
Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well

Now my mind is filled with rubber tires and forest fires
And whether I'm a liar
And lots of other situations where I don't know what to do
At which time God screams to me
"There's nothing left for me to tell you."
Nothing left for me to tell you
Nothing left

Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well, oh, well
Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well, oh, well
