Hear the mourners
The earth is gasping for air
Sneering at this thoughtless ravage
If we don't wake we'll massacre ourselves

Sneaking skullduggery
Slaughter the lungs of humanity
Spreading devastation through this world
a price we never can pay

Dethrone the impassive governments. No more of this
DUPERY
Pollution of environment
STOP THIS NOW
Before it's too late

Mouldering world
you're dying slowly piece by piece
All the riches you've created
will soon be laid destroyed

Dethrone the impassive governments. No more of this
DUPERY
Pollution of environment
STOP THIS NOW
Before it's too late

People
OBEY YOUR EYES
We can't repair when it's all destroyed
no way
DUPERY
Approaching death
TOMORROW FALLS
Why?

People
OBEY YOUR EYES
We can't repair when it's all destroyed
no way
DUPERY
Approaching death
TOMORROW FALLS
Why?

Paralysed by ignorance
The cemetery plans continue
A tremendous trepidation
Perfidious annihilation-all in vain
