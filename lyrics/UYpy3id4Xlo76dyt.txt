So isolated, I talk to the voice in my head
So isolated, my body is taking a leave
So isolated, I don't wanna let people see
My isolation is simple and stupid as me
Don't crowd 'cause I am not a shell
I burned myself when I was running hell

Don't let go, don't let go
Everybody knows
Don't let go, don't let go
Everybody shows

So isolated, I talk to the voice in my head
So isolated, my body is taking a leave
I sit alone, I hope that you can't tell
I'm dripping guilty, hide away and melt

Don't let go, don't let go
Everybody knows
Don't let go, don't let go
Everybody shows

Don't let go, don't let go
Everybody knows
Don't let go, don't let go
Everybody shows
Don't let go, don't let go
Everybody knows
Don't let go, don't let go
Everybody shows
