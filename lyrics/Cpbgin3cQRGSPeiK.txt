I just want you to love me,
but I'm not sure you got it in you.
You're boring into my body,
you're boring me with your stories.
I'm not listening.
I just want you to feel it.
But you,
You're not rotted like me.
No one knows,
they think that
I live in a shell.
But I'm soft water,
I'll make you sick
because I'm soft water.
Reach inside of me,
and scoop out my seeds.
Rotten pumpkin,
do not waste me.
You like to scare little children.
And I always felt like I was eleven.
Gum stuck in my hair,
and candy in your mouth.
I know you love it,
you know I love it,
we know we love it.
