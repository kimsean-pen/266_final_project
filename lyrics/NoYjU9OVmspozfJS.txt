So I climbed to the height of a mountain line
Is there a vision here
Woven to touch
And all to capture light?
Surely the stream of consciousness
Flows to the sea
Where drifting I found
That I can be
I'm really getting to know the empty space
Beneath the surface of common days

There I knelt at the foot of an open sky
Is it by faith, not time
The sun does climb
To light the path for us?
And I can embrace where I'm going
Tomorrow has already found me

I used to believe in a love watching over
I want to believe in that love yet again
I lost my touch to handle with kid gloves
In the rough game of push and shove
I lost sight
I used to believe in your love
To be believed in
Once more tonight

Will you speak to me fathers?
Grant me the words
That one day I'll be called to speak
And finally I am here understanding
The clear and constant page
Despite the shroud of material ways
Where dreaming the sound
A new found freedom

I used to believe in a love watching over
I want to believe in that love yet again
If you lose your touch to handle with kid gloves
In the hard game of push and shove
Don't lose sight
You can still receive the love
To be believed in
Once more tonight

Surely this dream of consciousness
Flows to the sea
Where drifting I found
That I can be
I'm really getting to know the empty space
Beneath the surface of common days
Where dreaming the sound
A new found freedom

I used to believe in a love watching over
I want to believe in that love yet again
If it all comes down to push and shove
Remember to lift your heart above the fight
You can still receive the love
To be believed in

To turn wrong to right
Beyond all the pain and the strife
Ride the turning tide
Lift a strength deep inside
We can transform wrong to right

We can still receive the love
To be believed in
Once more tonight
