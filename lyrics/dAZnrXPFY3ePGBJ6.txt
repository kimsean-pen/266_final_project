It's a love song baby come on (Whoah)
Even when our love is gone
'Til the end you'll be the one (Whoah)
And when you sing my song, it's done
So Chad, you filled me up inside
Oh Chad, I love the way you drive

Had a dream before, we were born
I grabbed you by the throat, and this is what I saw
A dramatic-eyed Snowden, with a creepy, crooked smile
Why?

Got my Chad
Wanted it, so bad
In the bag
Finally I'm not a slag
Now that I have got my Chad

Got my Chad
Wanted it, so bad
In the bag
Finally I'm not a slag
Now that I have got my Chad

Chad, you know I'm rad
You got me so bad
Chad, you're like a crab
No longer I'm sad
Crag, slag
Chad, stag
Gag, gag
Lag, Chad
Goat, throat
It's Chad
Chad Chad Chad Chad
