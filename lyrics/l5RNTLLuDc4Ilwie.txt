I don't care what you need, I only do it to please me
There's no one who sees it from my point-of-view
You're pulling me left to right
I had it up to here, it's making me sick to see you alive
Enough of conspiracy
'Cause you cannot win

Like a bomb I release my anger
I'll be peeling your skin
I'm gonna walk my way
You wont be holding me back

I'm not afraid of you

So just get out of my way
I'll destroy your life
'Cause you are pulling me down
You 've reached the end of the rope

So just get out of my way
So just get out of my way
Fear my agony, I'll turn your lies into dust
and everything you've become
Just crawl back where you came from

and disappear from here
Your life is talking a turn for the worse
Enough of conspiracy
'Cause you cannot win
Like a bomb I release my anger
I'll be peeling your skin
Like a bomb I release my anger
I'll be peeling your skin

I'm gonna walk my way

You won't be holding me back
I'm not afraid of you
So just get out of my way
I'll destroy your life
'Cause you are pulling me down

You've reached the end of the rope
So just get out of my way
I'm gonna walk my way

You won't be holding me back

I'm not afraid of you
So just get out of my way
I'll destroy your life
'Cause you are pulling me down
You've reached the end of the road

So just get out of my way
I know your kind
I've tasted before
You are spitting out all of your lies

I push you up against the wall

I'm gonna walk my way
You won't be holding me back
I'm not afraid of you
So just get out of my way
I'll destroy your life
'Cause you are pulling me down
You've reached the end of the rope
So just get out of my way
I'm gonna walk my way
You wont be holding me back
I'm not afraid of you
So just get out of my way
I'll destroy your life
'Cause you are pulling me down
You've reached the end of the rope
So just get out of my way
