She hypnotised me with her groove
She collects the stars and simple moon
She might say she don't but then she do
She before I wake up with nothing I know

There ain't no God or man could kill the burning fire
She is born in the middle of my soul
If you wait too long to taste the jewel
Jewel is gone, the lights are off
But you have run out of time

She will fill my bones and veins
She's the poison that will save you
She collects the laughter and the tears
She burns down the barns and sets your fears free

There ain't no God or man could kill the burning fire
She is born in the middle of my soul
If you wait too long to taste the jewel
Jewel is gone, the lights are off
But you have run out of time

She makes me feel like I'm falling under
She aspell like karma break, no wonder
She will leave the metal in the wound
She still hypnotised me with her groove
She knows

There ain't no God or man could kill the burning fire
She is born in the middle of my soul
If you wait too long to taste the jewel
Jewel is gone, the lights are off
But you have run out of time
