Eyes in the Sky gazing far into the night
I raise my hand to the fire but it's no use
Cuz' you can't stop it from shining through

It's true

Baby let the light shine through
If you believe it's true
Baby won't you let the light shine, through

For You!...

Won't you let the light shine, through

Eyes in the Sky gazing far into the night
I raise my hand to the fire but it's no use

Cuz' you can't stop it from shining through

It's true
Baby let the light shine through
If you believe it's true

Baby won't you let the light shine, through

For You!...
