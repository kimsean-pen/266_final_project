You're always running
Always running away
Ever wonder
Ever want to say

What's a fantasy
Meant to mean?
Just to flee
Far from here

Hey Fate
What do you think you're trying, to prove?
Think that you're trying, to prove?

I ain't got time
I ain't got skin
For the lies, again
For the lies, again

Ha hi, oh no
In spite of me, you always go
Forget the crying
Tempt the pain
Ha hi
Gone again

Ha hi, oh no
In spite of me, you always go
Forget the crying
Tempt the pain
Ha hi
Gone again

Maybe, I might be late
It might be strange
To come back
To your arms

Hey Fate
What do you think you're trying, to prove?
Think you're trying?

I ain't got time
I ain't got skin
For the lies, again
For the lies

Ha hi, oh no
In spite of me, you always go
Forget the crying
Tempt the pain
Ha hi
Gone again

Ha hi, oh no
In spite of me, you always go
Forget the crying
Tempt the pain
Ha hi
Gone again

Gone again

Ha hi
Ha hi
Ha hi
