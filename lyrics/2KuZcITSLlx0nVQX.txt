You try to lie, I can see that you don't need me
(That you don't need me, that you don't need me)
All of your words they've been cursed with dishonesty
(With dishonesty, with dishonesty)
Take it from the girl you claim to love you're gonna get some bad karma
I'm the one who had to learn to build a heart made of armor
From the girl who made you soup and tied your shoes when you were hurting
You are not deserving, you are not deserving
I can see that you wanted me cold
You're so bold while your watching me moan
You try to hide, I can see that you don't see me
(That you don't see me, that you don't see me)
What do you gain by the names that you're calling me?
(That you're calling me, that you're calling me)
Take it from the girl you claim to love you're gonna get some bad karma
I'm the one who had to learn to build a heart made of armor
From the girl who made you soup and tied your shoes when you were hurting
You are not deserving, you are not deserving
I can see that you wanted me cold
You're so bold while you're watching me moan
Holding out, like you could pull me down
'Cause I'm drowning for you
('Cause I'm drowning for you)
'Cause I'm drowning for you
Can you follow me out to the water? I can show you we're sinking deeper let me know, 'cause I'm drowning for you x4
