Carry me on one shoulder
I have had too much
I'm let down
In a search for a financial cure
I've met rats

Reliant
Trapped
What is good for me, doesn't pay
I'm a fake
So close to winning the game
Even closer to fooling heart
Haven't furniture, only fine clothes
To attract real wealth

Depthless, out of my element
Inside of my cage
It's when you're afraid but you
Don't know what you're afraid of
What is good for me
Can not pay for me
I've been led astray

I'm let down, take me up
Caught my bluff
Make a fortune

Was the trick
Lured away
A place where things go together
Turns out it's a real thing
