I feel my heart is getting lost
Being myself is painful
Someone says you don't have a chance
To restart the life that you never had
Negative emotions attacked me
Especially like this lonely night
Silence is eating my brain
Shutting me down and I'm stuck again
Years spent drawing and painting many colors on myself
Once I saw my future
But now I need to wipe off my eyes
Tell me when you have lost your way
What would you do to see the light again
A picture is the only way to remember
That your past is true
When you get trapped in your life
When you are up against the wall
What would you give to be free
Just like how we were before
Endless pain I've hand enough
If only just for now can't I have it all
But in the end it defeated me
Why do I let my past laugh at me
I've been dreaming and I've been drawing what I saw
But time waits up for no one
That's why we are living in a picture
Tell me when you have lost your way
What would ou do to see the light again
A picture is the only way to remember
That your past is true
When you get trapped in your life
When you are up against the wall
What would you give to be free
Just like how we were before
I feel my heart is getting lost
Being myself is painful
Someone says you don't have a chance
To restart the life that you never had
Negative emotions attacked me
I can feel my hope slipping away
I ask myself
Will you stay with me, with me
Tell me when you have lost your way
What would you do to see the light again
A picture is the only way to remember
That your past is true
When you get trapped in your life
When you are up against the wall
What would you give to be free
Just like how we were before
Tell me when you have lost your way
What would you do to see the light again
A picture is the only way to remember
That your past is true
When you get trapped in your life
Just wanna run but you don't have the strength
What would you give to be free
Just like how we were before
Just like how we were before
One more time
