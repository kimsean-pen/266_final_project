Jetlag, been in a state of disaster
Ever since I left you the last time
I saw you just fade away

Now I get lost, tracing my steps back
It cost nearly everything that
I'm not ready to lose today

No I'm not ready to lose everything I know, I'm letting go of
Paris, you know I held on too much
I left you at the station, I put you in my past
And now darling, all that shit's behind us
You never have to wonder, you never have to ask.

You never have to

Drink up every last drop and
Shake off the feeling that you're watching me now
I should have just told the truth.

But now sweetheart, listen to the way I
Cannot forget a single day I
Spent rolling all around the room with you.

It's just a fantasy, taking over like a disease
Pull me out of this I can't breath
It's burning through my chest

A fantasy, taking over like a disease
Pull me out of this I can't breath
I just need a rest from

Paris, you know I held on too much
I left you at the station, I put you in my past
And now darling, all that shit's behind us
You never have to wonder, you never have to ask.

You never have to

It's just a fantasy, taking over like a disease
Pull me out of this I can't breath
It's burning through my chest

A fantasy, taking over like a disease
Pull me out of this I can't breath
I just need a rest

No I'm not ready to lose you again

Oh Paris
I put you in my past
Oh darling
You never never never have to ask

You never have to
