As time goes by
Nothing has changed
I wont stand and watch
You wither away

After all this time
I stand by you
Through all of the years
I've been with you

Through pain and affliction
With every addiction
I will never let you down

I will live by this code
Never surrender
You and I are one

Through the eye
Of the storm
You are never alone
Even through, the shadows
You are never alone

After all this time
Still you struggle
Even words of love
Ring so hollow

I have no regrets
I have no remorse
And if you falter
I wont let you down

Through the eye
Of the storm
you are never alone
Even through, the shadows
You are never alone

Come on

Together we stand
Never fall
No matter the trial
We will overcome
Together we stand
Never fall
No matter the Trial
We will overcome

Through the eye
Of the storm
You are never alone
Even through, the shadows
You are never alone
Never
Together we stand
Never fall
No matter the trial
We will overcome
We will overcome
