Flaunt your will at every wheel
Parachute your chocolate soul
Cobblestone under your pants
I've got pictures on my mind
I've got pictures on my mind
I've got pictures on my mind
I've got pictures on my mind

Pa pa pa pa!

Circumvent your thick ego
Wooden farts, they're on the go
You can tell me that I'm real
I've got pictures on my mind
I've got pictures on my mind
I've got pictures on my mind
I've got pictures on my mind

Pa pa pa pa!

Fear waits (fear waits)
For us (for us)
When the present can be sealed away (away)
Gold dust (gold dust)
Now the dishes can be cleared

Fear waits (fear waits)
For us (for us)
'Til the moment is revealed (revealed)
Then turns (then turns)
To wrong (to wrong)
For the mighty conquered meal

Can't you look at my shaved ass?
Aunce is gone and God is once
You can't see me suddenly
I've got pictures on my mind
I've got pictures on my mind
I've got pictures on my mind
I've got pictures on my mind
I've got pictures on my mind
