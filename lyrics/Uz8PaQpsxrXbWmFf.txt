Prepare to witness a place of gore
Of legal dissection and blood on the floor
Carved up corpses, in the corner
Sliced up by a psychotic coroner
Slice, dice, chop them up haphazardly
Like laboratory mice
Splatter brain matter
Pound on the skull until it shatters

Hack, slice, chop, carve, rip and tear
Carving out your eyeballs, watch them sit and stare
Tear, rip, slice, carve, chop and hack
Toss them into a sack

Tags on bare feet, means a real treat,
To the butcher of human meat
Slice the throat from ear to ear,
Gallons of blood do appear
Veins exposed, torn from boddies,
The most interesting of hobbies
To get paid for such a task
Is more than any man could ask
Tags on bare feet, means a real treat,
To the butcher of human meat
Slice the throat from ear to ear,
Gallons of blood do appear

Splatter brain matter

Hack, slice, chop, carve, rip and tear
Carving out your eyeballs, watch them sit and stare
Tear, rip, slice, carve, chop and hack
Toss them all into a sack

Ripping, tearing your skin turning red
Vile surgeon, knife cutting in
Skull cracking, to expose your brain
Evil doctor death drove him insane
