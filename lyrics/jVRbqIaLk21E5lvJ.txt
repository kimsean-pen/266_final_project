Battering down sentence, fighting against convictions
Battering down sentence, fighting against convictions

I find myself growing in an environment
Where finding food is just as hard as paying the rent
In trodding these roads of trials and tribulations
I've seen where some have died in desperation

To keep battering down sentence, fighting against convictions
Battering down sentence, fighting against convictions

In a family of ten and raised in the ghetto
Hustling's the only education I know
Can't grow no crops in this concrete jungle
A situation like this is getting too tough to handle

To keep battering down sentence, fighting against convictions
Battering down sentence, all day long, fighting against convictions

With a pregnant woman, yes, and five kids to care for
Can't cool my heels, I've got to do the town
Skillful as I am, the jailer-man is bound to find me
I pray the day will come when I shall be free from

Battering down sentence, fighting against convictions
Battering down sentence, all live long day, fighting against convictions

To be trapped and caught and taken before judge and angry jury
Pleading before men, who seem to have no mercy
Can't afford to find myself down in the dungeons
I've got to stay free so that my kids won't be

Battering down sentence, fighting against convictions
Battering down sentence, all live long day now, fighting against convictions

Now a fugitive at large could this be my destiny
With no one to care for the welfare of my family
In solitude I've found new faith and hope in this I'll be secure
For mind and soul would soon be weary just couldn't take no more

Battering down sentence, all live long day, fighting against convictions
Children hear me when I say
Battering down sentence, all day long, fighting against convictions
Hear me when I sing my song
Battering down sentence, fighting against convictions
