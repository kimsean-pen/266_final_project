Empty frame on the wall
Cat and mouse when you don't call
All I do is think of her
T.V. screens pictures blurred

So take it away!
Take it away!

Every night the scene is set
I've got to drink to forget
I cannot incur this debt
Where's the gun? Here's my head!

Let's go to the Hong Kong
Breaking glass at Madame Wong's
Let's go buy a pint of booze
Getting drunk, getting loose

I just want some skank!
I just want some skank!
I just want some skank!
I just want some skank!

Passing flyers at the troub'
Seven nights, seven 'ludes
What's the deal with this band?
Let's go roll some fields, man

I just want some skank!
I just want some skank!
I just want some skank!
I just want some skank!

Every night would be so great
I'd take you home to meet Mom and Dad
And they'll be so glad
They won't think their boy's a fag
Then they'll go upstairs and go to bed
