I spent too many days In your confinement Captive to brazen lights
And to cursed to silence It's a different kind of pain Dark and
defiant Heightened adrenaline I need a regimen Find
me a sedative I been fucking Haunted by hindsight (
Haunted by hindsight) Daunted by timelines Lost in your mind's eye
Drop dead And burn the bridges that you built in
my head Disown decisions that you made in my stead (
I said) Close the prison and forget the time spent (
I've been) Left in this confinement too long But this won't clear my
name I had the coldest disdain I have to shoulder the blame For the
role that I played In the moments you faded a smoldering flame Hope
you know that I hate it And can't overstate that You don't feel the
same You should be I looked away I couldn't placate Twenty four hours
a day I had to stay I couldn't vacate Any morale that you gained You
weren't okay But I couldn't placate Twenty four hours a day I had to
stay Too many things were not said I hope you fucking drop dead Left
in this confinement too long I've been over my head too long This
terror in the night's been too long This terror in the night's been
too long I turned my back when you left her side There's nothing left
here to rectify Left alone and you're left
to die Left alone and I hope you drop dead
