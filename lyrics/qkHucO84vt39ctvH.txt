late at night
scratching the door
wanting a lover on the chase
you hear her growling for more
pussyfoot in quicksand
you'll never get far
she's gonna make you her toy
and tear you apart

out for the kill
stalking her pray
the fortunate ones
never get away
they say it's all fair in love
but it's not true
you'll be chasing her tail
till the night is through

if you mess with a tiger
t-t-t- tiger
you'll be under the claws of a
tiger
if you mess with a tiger
t-t-t- tiger
you'll be under her claws
like a tiger toy

i stalk, i prowl
i bat my eyes
cause i'm a predator at large
i got a lot on my mind
i'm gonna take him by the hand
i'm gonna lick his wounds
until i'm fully satisfied
until he's begging me to
meow!
i'll purr, i'll grow
i'll sharpen my claws
i'll take a nap in the sun
and then i'll lick my paws
got all the time in the world
cause he's a tasty little boy
yeah i'm a vicious tiger girl
come on and be my tiger toy

out for the kill
stalking her pray
the fortunate ones
never get away
they say it's all fair in love
but it's not true
you'll be chasing her tail
till the night is through

out for the kill...
t-t-t-tiger.tiger toy
all fair in love...
t-t-t-tiger
chasing her tail
till the night is through

if you mess with a tiger
t-t-t- tiger
you'll be under the claws of a
tiger
if you mess with a tiger
t-t-t- tiger
you'll be under her claws
like a tiger toy
