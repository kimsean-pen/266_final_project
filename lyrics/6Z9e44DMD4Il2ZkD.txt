Did you think that I,
Did you think that I,
Would fall down flat on my face?
Did your smug remarks
Ever reach the heart?
Pretentious, poised in place
"OMG, Look at me,
All I wanna be is just like him."
Filthy mean, Filthy Scene,
Slowly spiraling down into the drain.

2 sleepless weeks is all that it takes to find,
Foundations worth the time of our life.

This is our night, This is our time
This is our chance of feeling alive
Because chaotic minds can think alike.

This is our night, This is our time
This is our chance of feeling alive
Cause everyone knows the stars come out at night.

Oh dear, have we struck a nerve here?
Altered your perception,
Seeds of doubt have manifested into our investment.
Lay away while you pray that we'll go away
We will find you.
Like a ghost, here's a toast to eternity,
We are here to stay.

2 sleepless weeks is all that it takes to find,
Foundations worth the time of our life.

This is our night, This is our time
This is our chance of feeling alive
Because chaotic minds can think alike.

This is our night, This is our time
This is our chance of feeling alive
Cause everyone knows the stars, the stars come out at night.

(They come out at night) 5 soldiers in line with our blindfolds in hand,
Our spirit intact we abide by the land.
5 captains on deck with a look in their eyes,
Their ship may be broken but look at them fly.
Fixation with passion will push you to move,
The obstacle mentioned is referring to you.
You should know we're never ever ever gonna quit.

This is our night, This is our time
This is our chance of feeling alive
Because chaotic minds can think alike.

This is our night, This is our time
This is our chance of feeling alive
Cause everyone knows the stars come out at night.
