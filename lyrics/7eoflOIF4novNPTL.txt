What does it take for you to believe that I have changed?
I know very well that I have blood under my belt
Yes, it's true that I hurt you
But I still you, I love you, I still do
And what did I say to make you want to run away?
I know very well that I have blood under my belt
Yes, it's true that I hurt you
But I still love you, I love you, I still do
(But you don't believe me)

I see death coming at me too quickly
I don't want this to end
I take an apple from the tree we planted together
I hold it in my hand

I know I said "change"
But please don't change
I know I said "do it"
But don't do it, don't do it

What does it take for you to believe that I have changed?
I know very well that I have blood under my belt
Yes, it's true that I hurt you
But I still you, I love you, I still do
And what did I say to make you want to run away?
I know very well that I have blood under my belt
Yes, it's true that I hurt you
But I still love you, I love you, I still do
(But you don't believe me)

I am scared of the child that lives in me
I don't know if he learns
You left your t-shirt under the bed we shared together
I put it over my face

I know I said "change"
But please don't change
I know I said "do it"
But don't do it, don't do it

What does it take for you to believe that I have changed?
I know very well that I have blood under my belt
Yes, it's true that I hurt you
But I still love you, I love you, I still do
And what did I say to make you want to run away?
I know very well that I have blood under my belt
Yes, it's true that I hurt you
But I still love you, I love you, I still do
(But you don't believe me)
