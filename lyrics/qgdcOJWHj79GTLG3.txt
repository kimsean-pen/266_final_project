Ill-defined, the creatures in your dream
Faces you know, blurring out what they mean
A tangle of voices twisting words out of shape
A bunch of wire fingers
And no way to escape

There's no way of knowing how things fall apart
The smallest of incidents right from the start
The dreams are all pieces, the main segment's in your heart
