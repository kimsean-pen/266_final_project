Every single boy I know
Is thinking that he's in control
Nothing you can do to break his stride
Because he's mister cool and this is his party
I've seen it happen a million times
You can play it forward or rewind
You will always do what she decides
Cause she's got the keys to get you started

Automatic cause there's nothing you can do
Automatic boys she's taking over you
Automatic when you look into her eyes
Automatic boy she's got you hypnotized

I'm talking to you, she'll make a slave out of you,
But you can't help it boy, so it's okay
I'm talking to you, she'll make a slave out of you,
But you can't help it boy, so it's okay

Boy, you really need me, let's misbehave.
You're the formation overdrive
She pushes every button that she finds
She really gots your motor running high
And you know she's taking over your body
You wanna make your fingers move over her skin
You can really feel your temperature rising
She's giving you a system overload
Soon you gonna need a circuit rewriting

Automatic cause there's nothing you can do
Automatic boys she's taking over you
Automatic when you look into her eyes
Automatic boy she's got you hypnotized

I'm talking to you, she'll make a slave out of you,

But you can't help it boy, so it's okay
I'm talking to you, she'll make a slave out of you,
But you can't help it boy, so it's okay

She's got you hypnotized
Nothing you can do
You know it's automatic

Every single boy I know
Is thinking that he's in control
