I'm coming down to see ya
I'm looking for fast and cheap
I'm looking for the back of the streets
(Yeah-ow)

I'm gonna get experience
I came to see the candy man
To turn it up and drown

Feels just like it should
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should
(I'm gonna get experience)
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should
Turn it up and drown

I'm going on a laser beam
To shoot some Cherries down
I pick a little free agent
I got myself a fine wide smile
So baby for the first time

I need a little sugar 'n' spice
(Yeah-ow)
I wanna see the city lights
I'm gonna find a number

Feels just like it should
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should
I'm looking for fast and cheap

Feels just like it should
I'm looking for the back of the streets
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should
I'm gonna get experience
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should
I'm here to see the candy man
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should

Sugar-spice, I'm on the phone
I'm outside
I need a little sexfunk
I want you
I'm gonna lick you up and down
Feels good
She said it would feel that good
And it does

(Yeah-ow)
(Yeah-ow)
And it feels, it feels, it feels
And it feels, it feels, it feels
And it feels, it feels, it feels
Just like you
Just like you said it would
(Yeah-ow)

Feels just like it should
(Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should
I'm coming down tonight to taste y'all
Sugar-spice, I want you, a sexy girl
Slips in, it feels good
(I love it when you tell me)
Feels just like it should
