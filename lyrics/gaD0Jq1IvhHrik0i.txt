Take it back of your mind
I know that we can make it alright
Take it back of your mind
Take it back of your mind
We can forget it just for the night
Take it back of your mind

Tell me what you're waiting for
What you're waiting for
Come fade away
Come holiday
Tell me what you're waiting for
What you're waiting for
Come fade away
Come holiday

I know that I can make ya unwind, unwind
I know that I can make ya unwind, unwind
I know that I can make ya unwind, unwind
I know that I can make ya unwind, I know

Tell me what you're waiting for

Come fade away
Come holiday
Tell me what you're waiting for
What you're waiting for
Come fade away

So come like that
I know that

I know that I can make ya unwind, unwind
I know that I can make ya unwind, unwind
I know that I can make ya unwind, unwind
I know that I can make ya unwind, I know

I can free your mind
I don't give it time
Only you and I
I can free your mind
I don't give it time
Only you and I

Take it back of your mind
Take it back of your mind
Take it back of your mind
We can forget it just for the night
Take it back of your mind
