I suffer well
I suffer well
I suffer

I've killed my fears a thousand times, I've been oppressed
I'm digging in and found another reason to confess
I set on fire what's out my house so I can see the mess
Just take it all and burn it all, until there's nothing left

I suffer well
I suffer well
I suffer well
I suffer

Got amnesia, more than ever, 'cause I feel possessed
Razor blades can never heal this heart, it's such a mess
A mess

I suffer well, I suffer well
I suffer well, I suffer
Well
