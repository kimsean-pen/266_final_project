Money is time, time is a currency
You and I both know who you're spending yours on
You were the one, you cried for infinity
But you can't have it all, no, you can't have it all

Do I chose to be weighed down by gravity
To these thoughts that I own?
Oh, I don't like this feeling of jealousy
Yeah, it's not what I want

I love a girl who loves synchronicity
Stimulated by nothing more than the meaning of life
She's all around, she's like electricity
And I can't have her all, no, no, I can't have her all

Do I choose to be weighed down by gravity
To these thoughts that I own?
Oh, I don't like this feeling of jealousy
Yeah, it's not what I want

She refused to be weighed down by gravity
And now she's soldiering on
She confided that love, it is an energy
She's passing it on
