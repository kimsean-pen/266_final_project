Every day
blows by in a world of corrupt addiction
With life
comes pain withdrawals and deformation
Breaking
the mould of human appearance
Contorting
bodies chemical interference

The guilty one, innocent she now cries
A life of hell, better off to die!

Born without eyes, hands, and half a brain
Being born addicted to cocaine

Living monstrosity
Freak for life they'll always be
Never knowing love or hate
Only the pain the drug creates
(Solos)
(Murphy)
(Schuldiner)

Some say she's naive, she's a stupid bitch
Some say to forgive, guilty she should die

The beginning
of the end begins at birth
Breeding
masses of twisted screaming flesh
An example
we should make out of these creators of misfortune
A serious
crime that should not be forgiven

The guilty one, innocent she now cries
A life of hell, better off to die!

Born without eyes, hands, and half a brain
Being born addicted to cocaine
