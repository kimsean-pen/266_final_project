I felt you whimper.
And I felt you shake.
Collapse in my lungs.
And I felt you shake.
I was (??) alone on a lake.
Clearing my thoughts and emptying fate.
And you were like water
drowning my eyes
breathing my voice
With each one I take.
I'm just an orchard.
In the late winter nights
And you're just a harsh wind
That blows me away
I feel you break
With every night that you lie awake.
I was an old (?) lying awake (???)
I am the night sky
Closing my eyes
Counting the stars that you see in my (?).
