Honey, you are a rock
Upon which I stand
And I come here to talk
I hope you understand

The green eyes
Yeah, the spotlight shines upon you
And how could anybody deny you?

I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter now I've met you
And honey, you should know
That I could never go on without you

Green eyes

Honey, you are the sea
Upon which I float
And I came here to talk
I think, you should know

The green eyes
You're the one that I wanted to find
And anyone who tried to deny you must be out of their minds

'Cause I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter since I met you
Honey, you should know
That I could never go on without you

Green eyes
Green eyes

Honey, you are a rock
Upon which I stand
