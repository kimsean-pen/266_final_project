Aware Of Some, Aware Of Nothing More,
I Have No Faith I Cannot Settle Scores,
You Hope Some Day, I'll Move Out Of The Dark,
Your Wishes Fail 'Cause I Am Nothing...

Slave To It All Once Again I Fear,
Slave To It All Are The Ones Most Dear,

Thrilling You All With My Tales Not Real,
You Believe In Them Time After Time...

On Hopeless Days I Sit And Justify,
A Wholesome Life, Of Which I'm So Deprived,
I Hope And Pray, That I Won't Stay Around,
Too Long To Stain, 'Cause I Am Nothing...

Hope Someday?
I Could Be Wrong...
