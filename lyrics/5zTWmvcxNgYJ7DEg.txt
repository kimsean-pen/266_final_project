Oh, our dance was slow
And you fumbled with my hands
Whispered, "Time to sleep"
You have dreams awaiting your quiet mind

Does your heart get weaker
When you see how far we've to go?
Forget all the promises
You're tired and you're drifting and you're low

And if you can't steer
Then it would be safer to drop the anchor
And if you can't feel
It's selfish to use up all of the bandages

I can read your eyes
If this is real then it'll end
I shouldn't look so surprised
This happens over and over again

Does your heart get fiercer
When you think someday I might go?
Forget all the promises
You're tired and you're drifting and you're low

And if you can't steer
Then it would be safer to drop the anchor
And if you can't feel
It's selfish to use up all of the bandages

When you're alone, when you're hollow
Then you'll ask me to come and feel you
Come and feel you, don't think I will do

When you're alone, when you're hollow
Then you'll ask me to come and feel you
Come and feel you, don't think I will do
