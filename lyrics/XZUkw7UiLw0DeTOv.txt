Whoo!
It sure is hot out here
Ya know?
I don't mind though
Just glad to be free
Know what I'm saying, uh!

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You
(What'cha wanna do?)
I just wanna praise You
(Yeah, yeah)

You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands
(Uh feel me?)
And I'm gonna praise You
(What'cha gon do?)
I'm gonna praise You

In the corners of my mind
I just can't seem to find a reason to believe
That I can break free
'Cause you see I have been down for so long

Feel like all hope is gone
But as I lift my hands, I understand
That I should praise You through my circumstance

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You
I just wanna praise You

You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise You
I'm gonna praise You

Everything that could go wrong
All went wrong at one time
So much pressure fell on me
I thought I was gon lose my mind

But I know you wanna see
If I will hold on through these trials
But I need you to lift this load
'Cause I can't take it no more

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You
I just wanna praise You

You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise You
I'm gonna praise You

Been through the fire and the rain
Bound in every kind of way
But God has broken every chain
So let me go right now

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You
I just wanna praise You

You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise You
I'm gonna praise You
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just want to praise you
I just want to praise you
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise you
I'm gonna praise you
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just want to praise you
I just want to praise you
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise you
I'm gonna praise you
Take them off
What ya gonna do, yeah
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise you
(What ya gonna do)
I'm gonna praise you
