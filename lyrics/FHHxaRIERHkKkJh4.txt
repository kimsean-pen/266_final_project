Could you share it all with me
And I'll share it all with you
Share it all with me if you want to
I can see that you want to but though what's strong can be easy to you
I want you to know that I already know
I can see that you're thinking whatever you let yourself give in
You're looking at me like you already know

We'll never get to no room
They know the destination
Tell me what you want me to do
Exchange the information
Tell me what you want me to do
Don't run away

Could you share it all with me
Share it all with me
And I'll share it all with you
Just show me what to do
Share it all with me
Share it all with me if you want to

You're looking the other way
Never show you what you gonna do
But if you took the lead
Well, I could follow you
Keep going around again
It's like we've been here before

We'll never get to no room
They know the destination
Tell me what you want me to do
Exchange the information
Tell me what you want me to do
Don't run away

Could you share it all with me
Share it all with me
And I'll share it all with you
Just show me what to do
Share it all with me
Share it all with me if you want to

I know that you could too
I know that you could too

Show me what to do
Show me what to do
Show me what to do now
Show me what to do
Show me what to do
Show me what to do now
Show me what to do
Show me what to do
Show me what to do now

I could follow you
Yeah I could folow you

Share it all with me
And I'll share it all with you
Share it all with me
I know I could you

I know we could
I know we could
I know you could do too
