It is 4 am
It's so cold outside
All the labourers fix the broken pipes
La la la la, la la la la la
Hm hm hm hm, ha ha ha
And with, and with their hard hats on
They do all the things that we would not
Respect, respect the labourers
No, it wasn't built on rock and roll
La la la la, la la la la la
Hm hm hm hm, ha ha ha
Outside the majestic building
Pretty woman walks past the labourer
Pie in hand, she doesn't even see him
And with, and with your hard hat on
You build the city that I love
Respect, respect the labourers
No it wasn't built on rock and roll
Our great towers built with sweat and blood
La la la la, la la la la
And with, and with their hard hats on
They do all the things that we would not
Respect, respect the labourers
No it wasn't built on rock and roll
And with, and with your hard hat on
You build the city that I love
Respect, respect the labourers
No it wasn't built on rock and roll
Our great towers built with sweat and blood
