Just push up on me till I'm feeling hot
You got me going I don't wanna stop
Been gone too long, help me boy I forgot
How you do it baby, how you do it baby
Long long time since you put your hands on me
Long long time since you had me begging for your touch
Long long time since you put your hands on me
And I've been waiting for you to come
'Cause when the lights go off
Want you to turn me on, We'll be up all night long
Moving to our own song, Oh boy it's been a while
But you still drive me wild, My body's craving it
Don't stop until you make me sweat (sweat, sweat)
Don't stop until you make me sweat (sweat, sweat)
Don't stop until you make me sweat (sweat, sweat)
Don't stop until you make me sweat (sweat, sweat)
Don't stop until you make me sweat
Wanna hear your body talk to mine
So tell me the dirty things on your mind
It's been too long help me boy I forgot
How you do it baby, how you do it baby
Long long time since you put your hands on me
Long long time since you had me begging for your touch
Long long time since you put your hands on me
And I've been waiting for you to come
'Cause when the lights go off
Want you to turn me on, We'll be up all night long
Moving to our own song, Oh boy it's been a while
But you still drive me wild, My body's craving it
Don't stop until you make me sweat (sweat, sweat)
Don't stop until you make me sweat (sweat, sweat)
Don't stop until you make me sweat (sweat, sweat)
Don't stop until you make me sweat (sweat, sweat)
Don't stop until you make me sweat
Ooh, oooh
Long long time since you put your hands on me
Long long time since you had me begging for your touch
Long long time since you put your hands on me
And I've been waiting for you to come
'Cause when the lights go off
Want you to turn me on, We'll be up all night long
Moving to our own song, Oh boy it's been a while (been a while)
But you still drive me wild (drive me wild)
My body's craving it
Don't stop until you make me sweat (make me sweat)
Don't stop until you make me sweat (sweat, sweat)
Don't stop until you make me sweat (sweat, sweat)
Don't stop until you make me sweat (sweat, sweat)
Don't stop until you make me sweat
