(Ooh, ooh, ah)
Now I told you, so you oughta know (Ooh)
It takes some time for a feeling to grow (Ooh)
You're so close now I can't let you go (Ooh)
And I can't let go

(With you I'm not shy) To show the way I feel
(With you I might try) My secrets to reveal
For you are a magnet, and I am steel

I can't hope that I'll hold you for long (Ooh)
You're a woman who's lost to your song (Ooh)
But the love that I feel is so strong (Ooh)
And it can't be wrong

(With you I'm not shy) To show the way I feel
(With you I might try) My secrets to reveal
For you are a magnet, and I am steel

(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh)

(With you I'm not shy) To show the way I feel
(With you I might try) My secrets to reveal
For you are a magnet, and I am steel
For you are a magnet, and I am steel
For you are a magnet, and I am steel
