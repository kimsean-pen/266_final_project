Surf's up!

In the sun,
I'm waiting for the day
Having fun
In warm far away.
Moonlight nights,
water seems so clear.
Ooh, city lights
while I'm still waiting here...

In the sun,
it's for everyone.
In the sun, we're gonna have some fun.
In the sun
we're gonna shoot the tube.
I'll do it for you,
my paka lola luau love

New York isle is covered by grey
concrete piles, blues play my way.
Tropic haze,
pineapple sky.
Perfect wave,
hurricane eye.

In the sun, it's for everyone.
In the sun, we're gonna have some fun.
In the sun,
we're gonna shoot the tube.
I'll do it for you, my paka lola luau love.

(Whispered:
It's so hot you burn, it's so hot you burn,
it's so hot you burn.)

In the sun, it's for everyone.
In the sun, we're gonna have some fun.
In the sun,
we're gonna shoot the tube.
I'll do it for you,
my paka lola luau love.

Where is my wave?
Where is
my wave?
