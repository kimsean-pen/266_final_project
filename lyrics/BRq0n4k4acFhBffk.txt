She used to be a fragile baby in a Golden place
But now it seems her acid visions have come and changed
That face she says
I'm hallucinating
Queen in my pictures
She's drawing demon clusters on her stucco walls
And hanging all her clothing from her mothers ceiling
I'm hallucinating
Queen in my pictures
And all the handsome fellas used to want to hold her hand
But now she's finding it hard to find a loving man
I'm hallucinating
Queen in my pictures
I met her recently upon a swollen Nile
She spoke to me with? disconnected rhyme now
I am hallucinating
Queen in my pictures
