under a layer of broken bone
reaching out
into the shadows
like a razor cutting through the fold
sliced out
into the shadows

you're lips are cold 100 years
frozen deep inside your fear
a touch of stone my disease
buried deep inside of me

it's a call of the void
close to the edge
your hand on the switch

close your eyes you're on your own
only worse
into the shadows
there's a crack and it makes you crawl
head first
into the shadows

you're lips are cold 100 years
frozen deep inside your fear
a touch of stone my disease
burning deep

close your eyes you're on your own

it's a call of the void
close to the edge
your hand on the switch
