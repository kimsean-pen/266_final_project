Didn't you say you love me once upon a time
Didn't you whisper in my ear, "you're mine mine mine"
Didn't you turn your back on me and hurt me to the core
Head held high as it could be, you walked right out the door

Saying, "I don't want you, I don't need you"
"I don't love you anymore"
You broke my heart with so much ease
And now you dare to say you want me back again
Well, if you please

Time to get down on you knees
Time to beg, time to crawl, time to plead
Time to get down on you knees
Time has humbled you to pay up to the things that I've missed
Time to get down on you knees
Time to beg, time to crawl, time to get down on your knees
Time to get down on you knees
Time to get down on you knees

Didn't you care about me, the things you put me through
The heartaches that I lived with over you you you
You left my love go hungry while you fed your evil pride
Cheating right behind my back with all the times you lied

But I stayed at home while you went rogue, yeah
You left me hurting deep inside
You broke my heart with so much ease
And now you dare to say you want me back again
Well, if you please

Time to get down on you knees
Time to beg, time to crawl, time to plead
Time to get down on you knees
Time has humbled you to pay up to the things that I've missed
Time to get down on you knees
Time to beg, time to crawl, time to get down on your knees
Time to get down on you knees
Time to get down on you knees

Didn't take long to change your gong and come around
Now it's my turn to ball at you and mop the ground
On your knees

Get down on your knees when you crawl, baby
Let me see you plead, beg, crawl, baby get down

Get down, get down, get down on your knees
Baby let me see you thrown at me down on your knees
