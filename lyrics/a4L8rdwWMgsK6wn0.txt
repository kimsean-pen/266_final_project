Day has gone but I'm still here with you
My sweet rose, my green hills
Beloved sea, lakes and sky
Beloved mother earth

Silent land erase my thoughts
I wanna lose myself in you, all in you
Caress me and my soul while I close my eyes

On wings of destiny
Through virgin skies
To far horizons I will fly

Dear peaceful land, dear mother earth
Caress my soul while I close my eyes

On wings of destiny
Through virgin skies
To far horizons I will fly

On wings of destiny
Through virgin skies
To far horizons I will fly
