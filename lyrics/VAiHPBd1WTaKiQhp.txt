You are my breath and I wait for You to come and rescue me
We will raise our hands and we will lift our eyes
To the hills where our help comes from
Where our help comes from

My God, how times have changed
There was a moment when I could call You friend
You gave me so much and I kept on taking
Now I am standing here and You don't recognize my face
What have I become that I can't call You friend

I never thought my walls would be stripped away
The way your love pours out it takes my breath away
Your hands have led me here and have never left my side
You leave me speechless

With every breath we take let our lives proclaim
The promises that we've made to You

I need more of You because it's Your love
That has carried me through
The weight of the world seems to bring me to the ground
I know You're watching me above the clouds

I never thought my walls would be stripped away
The way your love pours out it takes my breath away
Your hands have led me here and have never left my side
You leave me speechless

With every breath we take let our lives proclaim
The promises that we've made to You

With every breath we take let our lives proclaim
The promises that we've made to You

With every breath we take let our lives proclaim
The promises that we've made to You

With every breath we take let our lives proclaim
The promises that we've made to You
