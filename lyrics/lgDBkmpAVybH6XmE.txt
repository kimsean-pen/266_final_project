I remember
When I first met you
You were my someone new
When everything was wrong
You blew me off my feet
Took my breath away
But now I'm a 100% okay
Without you

Oh baby you'll be crying tonight but you'll be fine in a day or two
Oh baby you'll be crying tonight but you'll be fine in a day or two
I know I know I know It's true, you'll be fine in a day or two
Oh baby you'll be crying tonight but you'll be fine in a day or two

We were gonna prove em' all wrong, me and you
Lying on the grass in the park all day long
Repeat on a favorite song, woah

When we can dance all night long
Doing things and see them wrong
Watch the sunrise form the rooftop Woah

Oh baby you'll be crying tonight but you'll be fine in a day or two
Oh baby you'll be crying tonight but you'll be fine in a day or two
I know I know I know It's true, you'll be fine in a day or two
Oh baby you'll be crying tonight but you'll be fine in a day or two

Young you, I'm leaving you
Young you, I'm leaving you, in a year with a stranger, in a year with a stranger
Young you, I'm leaving you
Young you, I'm leaving you, in a year with a stranger, in a year with a stranger

Oh baby imma cry tonight but I'll be fine in a year or two
Oh baby imma cry tonight but I'll be fine in a year or two
I know I know I know It's true, I'll be fine in a year or two
Oh baby imma cry tonight but I'll be fine in a year or two

Woah
Young you
