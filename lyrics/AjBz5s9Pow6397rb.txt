I will always need to be exclusive
Like a silly spoiled child
Like a silly spoiled child
And I keep being busy saying no
Just talk to the hand
Like a silly spoiled child

But you can see right through me

Slow
You hit the right spot
You hit the right spot, you know
Slow and low
Don't do it again
Don't do it again
Don't do it again

Slow
You hit the right spot
You hit the right spot, you know
Slow and low
Don't do it again
Don't do it again
Don't do it again

I am not the one that makes excuses
Like a silly spoiled child
Like a silly spoiled child
And I can't come along
I come undone
I'll hide in here forever
Can't come along
I come undone
I'll hide in here forever

I lose another one, another one
I'm losing my connection
I'm on my own but still fine

But you can see right through me

Slow
You hit the right spot
You hit the right spot, you know
Slow and low
Don't do it again
Don't do it again
Don't do it again

Slow
You hit the right spot
You hit the right spot, you know
Slow and low
Don't do it again
Don't do it again
Don't do it again

I lose another one, another one
Oh oh oh, I'm losing my connection
Oh oh oh
I lose another one
I lose another one (another one)
I'm losing my connection
I'm on my own but still fine

Slow
You hit the right spot (I lose another one)
You hit the right spot, you know (another one)
Slow and low (I'm losing my connection)
(I'm on my own but still fine) Don't do it again
Don't do it again
(I lose another one)
Don't do it again
(Another one)
(I'm losing my connection) Hm
(I'm on my own but still fine)
Don't do it again
