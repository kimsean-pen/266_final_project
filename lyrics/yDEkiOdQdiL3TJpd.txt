Wherever I run
Wherever I run to you lost one,
it's never done
Just hanging on

the past has let me be
returning as if dream
shattered as belief

if you have to go, don't say goodbye
if you have to go, don't you cry
if you have to go, I will get by
someday I'll follow you
and see you on the other side

but for the grace of love
I'd will the meaning of
heaven from above

but for the grace of love
I'd will the meaning of
heaven from above

your picture out of time
left aching in my mind
shadows kept alive

if you have to go, don't say goodbye
if you have to go, don't you cry
if you have to go, I will get by
I will follow you
and see you on the other side

but for the grace of love
who'd will the meaning of
heaven from above

long horses we are born
creatures more than torn
mourning our way home.
