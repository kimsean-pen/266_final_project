Electric heights
I'm a dizzy spell away from getting close to you
I was alive
With the things I never really thought that you could do
Can't compromise
When I think about the chance I had to make it work
I wanna die
From the ways I never really thought that it'd hurt

But now I'm begging you for something
That I thought I'd never want
Tears me to the ground
This is the apex of your hunt

I prayed, I'd have something that you'd still need
I'd have something that you'd still want
But now finding you gone, I see
I was alive
I was alive

But there were too many flags on the sand
Too many eyes
I never really thought that you would be my man
Electric heights
I'm a dizzy spell away from getting close to you
I wanna die
From the things I never really thought that you could do

Sight before sound, and I'm left there, oh
Sight before sound, and I'm left there, oh

Begging you, needing to
Begging you, needing to

I prayed I'd have something that you'd still need
I'd have something that you'd still want
Oh now finding you gone, I see
I was alive
I was alive

Electric heights, heights

Sight before sound and I'm left there
Sight before sound and I'm left there, oh
