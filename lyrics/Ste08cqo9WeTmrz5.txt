I told myself that
I would fix it
That I would tell you that I'm sorry and you'd still be listening
I told myself that
I would make it right, ohh

I promised you that
I wouldn't let down
I'd figure out the reasons we could never run from this town
Promised you that
We would be alright

I'm sleeping in daylight
I stayed up 'til midnight
Runnin' the whole town
Just to talk you down
Waiting where we've been
And sleeping with roses
'Cause you got the worst of me
But you got to leave and I have to be me
