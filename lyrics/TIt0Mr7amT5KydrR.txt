You look so beautiful today
When you're sitting there it's hard for me to look away
So I try to find the words that I could say
I know distance doesn't matter but you feel so far away

And I can't lie
Every time I leave my heart turns gray
And I wanna come back home to see your face tonight
Cause I just can't take it

Another day without you with me
Is like a blade that cuts right through me
But I can wait
I can wait forever
When you call my heart stops beating
When you're gone it won't stop bleeding

But I can wait
I can wait forever
You look so beautiful today
It's like every time I turn around

I see your face
The thing I miss the most is waking up next you
When I look into your eyes
Man, I wish that I could stay

And I can't lie
Every time I leave my heart turns gray
And I wanna come back home to see your face tonight
Cause I just can't take it
Another day without you with me
Is like a blade that cuts right through me
But I can wait

I can wait forever
When you call my heart stops beating
When you're gone it won't stop bleeding
But I can wait
I can wait
I can wait forever

I know it feels like forever
I guess that's just the price I gotta pay
But when I come back home
To feel you touch makes it better
Until that day
there's nothing else that I can do
And I just can't take it
Another day without you with me
Is like a blade that cuts right through me
But I can wait
I can wait forever
I can wait forever
When you call my heart stops beating
When you're gone it won't stop bleeding
But I can wait
I can wait
I can't wait forever
I can wait forever
I can wait forever
I can wait forever
I can wait forever
I can wait forever
