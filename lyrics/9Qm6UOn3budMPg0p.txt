All work and no play
Makes me a dull boy
All work and no play
Makes me a dull boy
All work and no play
Makes me a dull boy
All work and no play
Makes me a dull boy

Live in a secret
Live in a lie
Live in a dark hole
Beneath the black sky
Live like a martyr
And draw my last breath
Feel like an old man
With a knife in my chest
Live like a transient
Live like a thief
Hide in a closet
Grinding my teeth
Sit in a small room
With the walls closing in
Open the shutters
But everything's still dim

Payback
For all the things
I've done in my past
Payback
For everything
There are no take backs

I'm not the reason
It's not my fault
It's not my problem
I'm not the cause
I'm not your scapegoat
I'm not your god
I'm not your martyr
I'd leave you all

I'm not the reason
(I'm not your scapegoat)
It's not my fault
(I'm not your god)
It's not my problem
(I'm not your martyr)
I'm not the cause
(I'd leave you all)

Work and no play
Makes me a dull boy
Feel like a clown
Without my funny nose
Walk to the window
Break it out with my fist
Jump from the sill
And I'll plunge to my death
You can be selfish
Whatever ya think
Throw back my pills
And take a sip of my drink
Walk under the clouds
Walk under the trees
Always a canopy
Covering me

Payback
For all the things
I've done in my past

I'm not the reason
It's not my fault
It's not my problem
I'm not the cause
I'm not your scapegoat
I'm not your god
I'm not your martyr
I'd leave you all

I'm not the reason
(I'm not your scapegoat)
It's not my fault
(I'm not your god)
It's not my problem
(I'm not your martyr)
I'm not the cause
(I'd leave you all)

Sunshine's gone
It's all gone
By the way
Just so you know
Always
This is how I feel
By the way
Just so you know
Always, everyday
This is how I feel

I'm not the reason
It's not my fault
It's not my problem
I'm not the cause
I'm not your scapegoat
(I'm not your scapegoat)
I'm not your god
(I'm not your god)
I'm not your martyr
(I'm not your martyr)
This is how I feel
(This is how I feel)

By the way
Just so you know
Always, everyday
This is how I feel
