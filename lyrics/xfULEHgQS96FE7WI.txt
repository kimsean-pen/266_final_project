I got a Glock in my backpack
Pull up to school with my backpack
Told em no talkin we pass that
Wanna run up bitch I jump in the hatch backs

Big ass big dope
Big syrup lil soda
Ten cops pulled up
Stay sir card loyal

I gots that Glock in my backpack
Pulled up to school with my backpack
Told em no talkin we pass that
Wanna run up bitch I jump in the hatch backs

Big ass big dope
Big syrup lil soda
Ten cops pulled up
Stay sir card loyal

I put em down with a lead pipe
Killin a ruse in a street fight
Dragon gon fly with that moonlight
Dragin your body turn blood into moonshine
G check street cred
Green light beams red
12 shots 4 dead
White force coat stead

I copped a round and I cut it up
You think you scale you want numbers huh
Thinkin they fish cause your 50 numb
Hit that lotto K tell that product up
Gotta flip a pack before I shower up
Gotta load my strap fuck her one on one
Still I beat your ass like a dentist son
Keep a couple boonies all I need is one

Bodies be pillin up
Ain't no more room left up under the towels
And I am too violent so
Seeds I been poppin the police been trying
To start and profiling us
All of my tattoo is them to get files
But you wake them bodies up

Sit your ass down cause if think I'm throwin shade
Then I probably was
And I ain't with that talk
And so fuck boy please don't step up
You sniffin on that powder
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm still packin shakes
Like all my motherfuckin scrubs
Now hit the pit and fuck it up

I got a Glock in my backpack
Pull up to school with my backpack
Told em no talkin we pass that
Wanna run up bitch I jump in the hatch backs

Big ass big dope
Big syrup lil soda
Ten cops pulled up
Stay sir card loyal

I gots that Glock in my backpack
Pulled up to school with my backpack
Told em no talkin we pass that
Wanna run up bitch I jump in the hatch backs

Big ass big dope
Big syrup lil soda
Ten cops pulled up
Stay sir card loyal
