They look down
At the ground missing
But I never go in, now

I'm lookin' at the big sky
I'm lookin' at the big sky now
I'm lookin' at the big sky
You never understood me, you never really tried

That cloud, that cloud
Looks like Ireland
Come on and blow it a kiss, now

Quick, 'cause it's changing in the big sky
It's changing in the big sky, now
We're lookin' at the big sky
You never understood me, you never really tried

This cloud, this cloud says Noah
Come on, build me an ark
And if you're coming, jump

'Cause we're leaving with the big sky, baby
We're leaving with the big sky, honey
We're leaving with the big sky
We're lookin' at the, we're lookin' at the

And we pause for the jet
Hup hup, hup, in the big sky
We're lookin' at the big sky, honey

You want my reply?
Oh, what's the question? Yeah
I was lookin' at the big sky

Big sky, lookin' at the big sky
Lookin' at the, tell 'em, sisters

Rolling over like a big big cloud
Walking out in the big sky
Rolling over like a big big cloud
Walking out in the big sky

Rolling over like a big big cloud
Walking out in the big sky
Rolling over like a big big cloud
Walking out in the big sky

Rolling over like a big big cloud
Walking out in the big sky
Rolling over like a big big cloud
Walking out in the big sky
