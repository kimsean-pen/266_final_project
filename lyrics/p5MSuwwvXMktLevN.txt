Some days I feel like cryin'
It don't matter if it's rain or shine
I feel like my heart was broken
At least a million times
And some days I wake up dreaming
Feels like I never even woke
I answer life's big questions
As if it's one big joke
Maybe it's too soon to be sure
But I really do believe that some day
We're gonna have it all
So I try so hard
To keep the rhythm of a train
Rollin' right along
When the ride gets rough
You got to carry on
Carry on
Some days I feel like singing
I sit back and just groove the day away
Maybe pick up a guitar
And play what I wanna play
Maybe it's too soon to be sure
But I really do believe that some day
We're gonna have it all
So I try so hard
To keep the rhythm of a train
Rollin' right along
When the ride gets rough
You got to carry on
Carry on
Ya got to carry on
Oh ya got to carry on
Ya got to carry on
Carry on, yeah
Today I feel like laughing
Seems to be no reason at all
And if the world stopped spinning
I'm not afraid to fall... no
Maybe it's too soon to be sure
But I really do believe that some day
We're gonna have it all
So I try so hard
To keep the rhythm of a train
Rollin' right along
When the ride gets rough
You got to carry on
Maybe it's too soon to be sure
But I really do believe that some day
We're gonna have it all
So I try so hard
To keep the rhythm of a train
Rollin' right along
When the ride gets rough
You got to carry on
Carry on
