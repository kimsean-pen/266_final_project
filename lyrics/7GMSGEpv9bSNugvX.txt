Scarecrow on a wooden cross
Blackbird in the barn
400 empty acres
That used to be my farm
Grew up like my daddy did
My grandpa cleared this land
When I was five I walked the fence
While grandpa held my hand

Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
This land fed a nation
This land made me proud
And son I'm just sorry
There's no legacy for you now
Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow

The crops we grew last summer
Weren't enough to pay the loans
Couldn't buy the seed to plant this spring
And the Farmers' Bank foreclosed
Called my old friend Schepman up
To auction off the land
He said, "John it's just my job
And I hope you understand"
Hey calling it your job
Ol' hoss, sure don't make it right
If you want me to
I'll say a prayer for your soul tonight
Grandma's on the front porch swing
With a Bible in her hand
Sometimes I hear her singing
Take me to the Promised Land
When you take away a man's dignity
He can't work his fields and cows

There'll be blood on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
Blood on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow

Well there's 97 crosses planted in the courthouse yard
And 97 families who lost 97 farms
I think about my grandpa
My neighbors and my name
Some nights I feel like dyin'
Like that scarecrow in the rain

Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
This land fed a nation
Hey, this land made me proud
And son I'm just sorry
They're just memories for you now
Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
This land fed a nation
This land made me so proud
Son I'm just sorry
They're just memories for you now
Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow, hey
