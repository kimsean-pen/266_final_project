I was lost by the river
And I couldn't find a home
And I didn't have no, no way to roam

Oh won't somebody hear me, hear me
Come on, hear me at all
Help me, please
I'm just a lonely boy
I ain't got no home

I need you so much, darling

Yeah, I've been wandering

Wandering for such a long, long time
Won't somebody
Please give me peace of mind
Won't somebody hear me at all
Hear me at all, set me free
I'm just a lonely boy
I ain't got no home

I got no sail, darling, yes
Can't you hear me cry
