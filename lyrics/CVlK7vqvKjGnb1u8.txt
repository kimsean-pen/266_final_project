She's my ex.
I can't cross her from my memory
She meant everything to me
she meant every word she said
When she said, "I'll never ever love again.
Be my ex until the end."
And I know
I'll never feel that way again
She's just my ex
She marks the spot where I'm the weakest one
I can't expect she'll change her ways;
can't accept the things she's done

She's just my ex.
Nothing more nothing less
but she'll always be my ex

She's my ex.
Don't cross her path she still belongs to me
She'll be my ex till I say when
till I get her back again
'Cause I know I'll never ever love again.
Never need another friend
And I know I'll never feel this way again

She's my ex.
She'll cross my mind a thousand times today
Still have a million things to say,
guess I'm better off this way
Cause I know she's never gonna love again.
She'll be my ex until the end
And I know I'll never feel this way again

She's just my ex.
Nothing more nothing less
but she's still my ex A
nd I could never kiss that face goodbye
But I could never stop to wonder why
She looks so pretty, she looks so pretty
And I know I'll never feel this way again
She's just my ex
