45 caliber in my face
Shot him in the head because of his race
Now that he's dead we will plead his case
While the executioner is out on base

I just thought somehow
That things would get better

It's enough
It's enough
It's enough
And the system you cannot trust
It's enough
It's enough
When the whole wide world just goes round
It's enough
It's enough
And we all are just getting fucked
It's enough
It's enough

What's that going down in the Middle East?
Do you really think it's to keep the peace?
How we love to control a foreign land
Taking all we can is always the plan

And they know
They know
That Africa is the center

It's enough
It's enough
It's enough
And the system you cannot trust
It's enough
It's enough
When the whole wide world just goes round
It's enough
It's enough
And we all are just getting fucked
It's enough
It's enough

When will the desire for love
Outweigh the desire for power
When will we face the truth
And allow our hearts to flower

For the planet, for the people
For every living thing upon this world, yeah

The destruction (Destruction)
And the hatred (Oh he hatred)
Is about to take us down for good

What's in all those trails up there in the sky
Why has all the food become modified
Pushing all your drugs just to keep us high
While the media propagates the lie

And I know
Oh yes I know (I know)
The all seeing eye is the devil

It's enough
It's enough
It's enough
And the system you cannot trust
It's enough
It's enough
When the whole wide world just goes round
It's enough
It's enough
And we all are just getting fucked
It's enough
It's enough

It's enough
It's enough
It's enough
And the system you cannot trust
It's enough
It's enough
When the whole wide world just goes round
It's enough
It's enough
And we all are just getting fucked
It's enough
It's enough

It's enough
It's enough
It's enough
And the system you cannot trust
It's enough
It's enough
When the whole wide world just goes round
It's enough
It's enough
And we all are just getting fucked
It's enough
It's enough

We are living in these times
Where the evil one come to rob us blind
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

People, we must understand
That it's time to wake up and do what we can
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, woo
