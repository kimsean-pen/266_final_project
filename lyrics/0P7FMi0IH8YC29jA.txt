So you came like a missile
Falling on my head
With a black sky
You think you're giving.
But you're taking my life away

Then you came with your breezeblocks
Smashing up my face like a bus-stop
You think you're giving.
But you're taking my life away

Like the drunk you convinced was sober
You keep me falling over
You think you're giving.
But you're taking my life away

With your best of intentions
You try to give an ocean directions
You think you're giving.
But you're taking my life away

So you came like a missle
Leaving me the whole world in exile
You think you're giving.
But you're taking my life away

Like the drunk you convinced was sober
You keep me falling over
You think you're getting.
But you're taking my life away
You think you're giving.
But you're taking my life away
