Lying all alone in bed
Crazy thoughts running through my head
Thinkin' about you

Tryin' hard to let it go
My head says yes but my heart says no
I wish I never had to choose

I've been walking down the same old road
Tryin' hard to forget you
But I just can't let you go

I still think about you
Do you think about me?
I still think about you

No matter where you go
Just as sure as a cold wind blows
I still think about you
Do you think about me?

Baby, I remember when
You and me were best of friends
We crossed our hearts and swore it lasts forever

But I guess that lovin' me
Was just a temporary thing
And I wish to God that we were still together

I hope you found what you were looking for
It's been 3 years, a lot of tears
Ain't got nothing but this song

I still think about you
Do you think about me?
I still think about you

No matter where you go
Just as sure as a cold wind blows
I still think about you
Do you think about me?

When you're all alone
When you need a friend
I guess it doesn't matter
'Cause what we had we'll never have again

Lyin' all alone in bed
Crazy thoughts running through my head
Thinkin' about you

I still think about you
Do you think about me?
I still think about you

No matter where you go
Just as sure as a cold wind blows
I still think about you

Ohh...

I still think about you
Do you think about me?
I still think about you

Yeah...

No matter where you go
Just as sure as a cold wind blows
I still think about you
Do you think about me...?
