Sweetheart are you done, on the other side?
Hand in hand we fall
Fighting for our lives

Black and blue, I feel it too
It started so young
Intrusive thoughts
And tightened jaw biting down on my tongue
And no one could pull me out
All I had was myself
I keep running into hell
Running into hell
Looking for God

I'll be there when you're done, on the other side
Holding hands with the rest of us
Fighting for our lives
In your heart you wanna run
In your head you wanna hide
Holding hands with the rest of us
Fighting for our lives

We all wanna be, just wanna feel loved
We all wanna be, just wanna feel loved
We all wanna be, just wanna feel loved
I know you gotta get better

I'm not my best, comforted by mess
Somewhere in the blank space of my mind
A labyrinth with no light
And all the mountains they can't be moved
Push the envelope, work the grooves
Strength comes from adversity
It all starts with you and me

I'll be there when you're done, on the other side
Holding hands with the rest of us
Fighting for our lives
In your heart you wanna run
In your head you wanna hide
Holding hands with the rest of us
Fighting for our lives

I just wanna make it all stop
I just wanna make it all stop
I'm gonna give it all that I've got
I'm gonna give it all that I've got
I just wanna make it all stop
I just wanna make it all stop
I'm gonna give it all that I've got
I'm gonna give it all that I've got

I just wanna make it all stop
I'm gonna give it all that I've got
Somewhere in the blank part of my mind
My mind

So sweetheart are you done?
Can you see it's just a ride?
And hand in hand we fall
Hand in hand we rise
I'll be there when you're done
Standing in the light
Holding hands with the rest of us
Fighting to survive

In your heart you wanna run
And in your head you wanna to hide
In your heart you wanna to run
And in your head you wanna to hide

We all wanna be, just wanna feel loved
We all wanna be, just wanna feel loved
We all wanna be, just wanna feel loved
We all wanna be, just wanna feel loved
(Don't let go)
We all wanna be, just wanna feel loved
(Don't let go)
We all wanna be, just wanna feel loved
(Hold on)
We all wanna be, just wanna feel loved
I know you gotta get better
