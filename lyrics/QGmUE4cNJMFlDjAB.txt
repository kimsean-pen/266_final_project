Been floating so high
The air's getting thin
The moon on the tide
How you pull me in

I never thought I would fall
Never thought I would fall
I never thought I would fall
Never thought I would fall
I wasn't ready at all
Never thought I would fall
I never thought I would fall
Never thought I would fall
I never thought I would fall

Coming down from the mountain
Now I know what to do
Gravity centered
Closer to you

I never thought I would fall
Never thought I would fall
I never thought I would fall
Never thought I would fall
I wasn't ready at all
Never thought I would fall
I never thought I would fall
Never thought I would fall
I never thought I would fall

Been floating so high
The air's getting thin
The moon on the tide
That's how you pull me in

I never thought I would fall
Never thought I would fall
I never thought I would fall
Never thought I would fall
I wasn't ready at all
Never thought I would fall
I never thought I would fall
Never thought I would fall
I never thought I would fall
