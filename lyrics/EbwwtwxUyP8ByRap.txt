I feel like I'm walking a thin line
Balancing thoughts on a zip-tie
I'd let them fly if the quiet would
finally silence the voice that is inside
Weighing my words before that I've spoken
Day of my birth, caught in the motions
Why do I only feel norm in the eye
of the storm by the roar of the ocean
Over and over again
Though we both know where this ends
It's sobering knowing that coping alone with this stress
It all falls over the edge
Have mercy am I blasphemous? So
Burn me with fire or Cannabis smoke
I've worked all my life with hands on my throat
Searching for highs to balance the lows
I've been spending my days with reckless abandon
Searching for balance
I'm drifting away with no counter weight
I've tried changing my ways, I'm stuck in here stranded
Searching for balance
I'm drifting away with no counter weight
No I've got no counter weight
Woah oh oh, woah oh oh
Woah oh oh, woah oh oh
Woah oh oh, woah oh oh
Woah oh oh
If it's all in front of me
Why's it awaken the kind of sensation of falling suddenly
Like every step could be pulled from under me
And so it don't all catch up to me
I move at the speed of light
Losing my peace of mind
Pursuing my demons, lucid or dreaming
Can't keep doing this, truth is a need a vice
I'm all out of love now
If abandoned my sanity's struck down
Started actually giving a fuck 'bout
Who's catching me when I come down
I pray that you follow
So I'm paving a way to escape from this lotto
It's beautiful today, heart breaking tomorrow
I've been spending my days, with reckless abandon
Searching for balance
I'm drifting away, with no counter weight (Woah oh oh)
I've tried changing my ways, I'm stuck in here stranded
Searching for balance
I'm drifting away, with no counter weight
No I've got no counter weight
Woah oh oh, woah oh oh
Woah oh oh, woah oh oh
Woah oh oh, woah oh oh
Woah oh oh, woah oh oh
Don't wanna be here forever
Take me from this place
Don't wanna live forever
Just wanna live today
Don't wanna be here forever
Take me from this place
Don't wanna live forever
Just wanna live today
I've been spending my days, with reckless abandon
Searching for balance
I'm drifting away, with no counter weight (Woah oh oh)
I've tried changing my ways, I'm stuck in here stranded
Searching for balance
I'm drifting away, with no counter weight
No, I've got no counter weight
