Sometimes I see some things that I shouldn't see;
simple patterns that are sitting right in front of me
Try to climb ever higher
try to get to the sky
and though I've been to the clouds
it's just a temporary high

Take time, I said now what you're trying to do,
if you're gonna see it through
it takes time
I said it takes some time to figure it out
Stay in line
But how do you follow it and cross it at the same time?
You just can't cross it
oh, no

I don't wanna say the things I have to say
who's to say that I'll ever say them at all?
Gotta be that, gotta get it with that act
Gotta wear the hat although it's all a mismatch
Squared circles, ran around the hurdles
I did everything, I thought there was a purpose?
Can somebody show me how to get in?
'Cause I can't figure out how to get in.

Can somebody show me?
I can't see in The Dark
Can somebody take me?
I can't stay in The Dark?
Will you Illuminate me on out of
The Dark?

Turning pages, turning corners,
turning into another
Turning into a song that's just like
every other
They say to get there
you already have to be there to start
How do you get there when you know it's what you need
in your heart?
