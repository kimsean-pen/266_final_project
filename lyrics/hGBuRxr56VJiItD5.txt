Yeah, I breathe irresponsibly
Inhale into my bloodstream
This space I can't seem to fill

Hard up begging but I'm still lost in
The margin there's a line
Can't turn the pages I have tried,
Hopeless if you only see,
I'm here to focus on the lighter side you care?
And in truth I don't compare

'Cause
You're so around me, might be subconsciously
But I don't feel like I'm still on my own

'Cause I've been looking for a good girl
Yeah, I'm looking for a good girl
Tell me if you think you found
Maybe there's a chance you'll let me know

'Cause I've been looking for a good girl
Yeah, I'm looking for a good girl
Tell me if I'm looking at
Can I get a sign before you go?

(Make it obvious to me)...

I brought the jaded here tonight
But you send a message to my spine
One look, I can't turn away
And I'm hooked, tell me what you say

Lost in your movement and your lies
Can I just put you through my side?
Hopeless if you never see
I'm here to focus on the lighter side you care
And in truth I don't compare

'Cause
You're just around me, might be subconsciously
But I don't feel like I'm still on my own

'Cause I've been looking for a good girl
Yeah, I'm looking for a good girl
Tell me if you think you found
Maybe there's a chance you'll let me know

'Cause I've been looking for a good girl
Yeah, I'm looking for a good girl
Tell me if I'm looking at
Can I get a sign before you go?

Make it obvious to me
Make it obvious to see
Make it obvious to me
Make it obvious to see

Tell me if you think you found...
'Cause I've been looking for a good girl
Yeah, I'm looking for a good girl
Tell me if you think you found
Maybe there's a chance you'll let me know

'Cause I've been looking for a good girl
Yeah, I'm looking for a good girl
Tell me if I'm looking at
Can I get a sign before you go?
