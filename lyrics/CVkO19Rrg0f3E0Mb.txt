Walk in the park, and it's getting dark, and I don't wanna be alone
Miss my Mummy and I miss my Daddy won't you please bring them back home
Fly down the lane through the wind and the rain till the fires of the evening go
Miss my Mummy and I miss my Daddy won't you please bring them back home
Drift in time as the mountains rise from the floor of the valley below
Seasons change as the rivers meet the sea

Walk in the park, and it's getting dark, and I don't wanna be alone
Miss my Mummy and I miss my Daddy won't you please bring them back home
Tire of the trail as the daylight fails and the shadows of the east do grow
Miss my Mummy and I miss my Daddy won't you please bring them back home
Side by side in the countryside with no thought for getting home

Distant stars are the only lights to see
Miss my Mummy and I miss my Daddy won't you please bring them back home
