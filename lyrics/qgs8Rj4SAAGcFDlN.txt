You will pull strange gifts from the heart of the trees, oh...
Unforgotten love not forgotten peace, oh no...
Will you drag me into the heart of the boiling sea?
You can soothe my mind with your silence,
Oh Sara, I hear you calling me...

Sara, wake me up when you're home...
Ah, Sara, wake me up when you're home...
Sara, wake me up when you're home...
Ah, Sara, wake me up when you're home...

You're a golden beam breaking into the ocean deep...
On a single breathe to be lead to escape, no...
Now you cast your light and exposing the same colors, oh...
You consume my mind into silence,
Oh, Sara, I hear you calling me...

Sara, wake me up when you're home...
Ah, Sara, wake me up when you're home...
Sara, wake me up when you're home...
Ah, Sara, wake me up when you're home...
