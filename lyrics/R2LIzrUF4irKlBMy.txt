Healing of a nation, I cients
Whoa, whoa, whoa

A boom draw of herb deh by mi bed side
Open book of scriptures I man won't deny, keep it high
The grass is greener on the other side
A good meditation man can't hide

Say me have fi catch up all a fire
Fi go burn di sinting, sinting weh strong
Mi have fi send fi rizzla
Fi go burn di sinting, sinting weh strong

Forgot me have fi send fi a quarter
'Cause mi find out mi sittin it done
May have fi send fi a lighter
Fi go burn down Babylon

Ey, oh green grade, purple grade, brown grade for me
High grade, topper grade medicate for me
Give me meditation, give me vibes in a hurry
A boom draw of herb keeps me curry

Way back in days of old
Before Babylon entered where plants were grown
A lickle draw of herb was on Solomon's throne
You can't tell I and I leave it alone

It's like 1, 2, 3 draws for me
Come take a seat a lickle reasoning with me
Elevate yourself keep your mind ever ready, steady

Well, mi have fi catch up all a fire
Fi go burn di sinting, sinting weh strong
Mi have fi send fi a rizzla
Fi go burn di sinting, sinting we strong

Forget me have fi send fi a quarter acre
The lilly bit it done
Mi have fi send fi a lighter
Fi go burn down Babylon

Oh Kayaman, Rastaman pass me di cutchi
Chant two psalms give praises to haile
Anywhere we deh di boom draw we have fi get it
A could a fresh or pressie

Herbs to I is a sacrament
And if you feel I and I then a message sent
You have fi class green as intelligence
The king of kings a we represent

Is like east-land, west-land or New Zealand
Have a good draw coming straight from Westmoreland
As we blaze it up we see clear to progression
We no deal with oppression

Catch up all fire
Fi go burn di sinting, sinting weh strong
Mi have fi send fi a rizzla
I go burn di sinting, sinting weh strong

Forget me have fi send fi a quarter
The lilly bit it done
Me have fi send fi a lighter
Fi go burn down Babylon

Oh, run, run, run as fast as you can
You cant catch me I'm the green green man
Up and down looking everywhere trying ti find me
But me up in mi high, high medi

Like a bird we soar, burn it up galore
Are you really sure you can burn one more?
You got to be mature to open up the door
Got to be secure, got to be for sure

Mi have fi advertise, it keep mi stress from rise
Now I visualize, X-ray through their lies
Cool and gwan observe and mello out your nerve

Well, mi have fi catch up all fire
Fi go burn di sinting, sinting weh strong
Mi have fi send fi a rizzla
I go burn di sinting, sinting weh strong

Forget me have fi send fi a quarter
The lilly bit it done
Me have fi send fi a lighter
Fi go burn down Babylon

A boom draw of herb deh by bed side
Open book of scriptures I man won't deny, keep it high y'all
The grass is greener on the other side
A good meditation I man can't hide
