See all your sorrow
But be happy tomorrow
From the back of my mind
I was searching (and I...)

From the look
In your face
I believe
It's not too late

See where you are
When did we go that far
From the things that we said
I was wishing us dead
Turn around
To the fool
Who believed
Don't ask why

(Pillow) pretend
That I do not defend
My own love in the back
Need no question to ask

If you need
To see
The (real)
Don't ask me
