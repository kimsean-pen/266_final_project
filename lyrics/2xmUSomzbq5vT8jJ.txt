I remember sneaking out, porch steps creaking now
Hoping that we weren't too loud
I remember thinking that, if we keep on drinking
We'll be warm when the sun goes down

And would you mind sleeping in the car?
'Cause we left the lights on, killed the battery, and it won't start
Could we make the most of the dark?
'Cause I left the lights on, killed the battery

When you watch me like that, you watch me like that
You watch me
When you watch me like that, I forget I've been lonely
Do you want me like that? You want me like that?
You want me?
'Cause I want you like that, so could we let it be easy?

We could go swimming now, smoke and get some In-N-Out
Do you ever miss being ten years old? 'Cause
This is kinda feeling like, cheating on your bedtime
These days, no one's waiting up at home

Would you mind sleeping under stars?
'Cause I couldn't stand it, if we missed our chance to take it too far
Could we make the most of the dark?
'Cause I couldn't stand it, knowing that we never took it too far

When you watch me like that, you watch me like that
You watch me
When you watch me like that, I forget I've been lonely
Do you want me like that? You want me like that?
You want me
'Cause I want you like that, so could we let it be easy?

Lean back
Are you falling asleep?
Head lights catching
The whites of your eyes and you're looking at me

When you watch me like that, you watch me like that
You watch me
When you watch me like that, I forget I've been lonely
Do you want me like that? You want me like that?
You want me
'Cause I want you like that, so could we let it be easy?
