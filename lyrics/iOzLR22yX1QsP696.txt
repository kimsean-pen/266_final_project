Should I try to hide the way I feel inside my heart for you?
Would you say that you would try to love me too?
In your mind, could you ever be really close to me?
I can tell the way you smile

If I feel that I could be certain then
I would say the things I want to say tonight

But till I can see that you'd really care for me
I will dream that someday you'll be really close to me
I can tell the way you smile

If I feel that I could be certain then
I would say the things I want to say tonight

But till I can see that you'd really care for me
I'll keep trying to hide the way I feel inside
