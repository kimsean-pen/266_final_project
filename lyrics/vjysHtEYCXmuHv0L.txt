Are you ready?
Ooh, c'mon

Ain't it funny how time flies, huh
Out of sight, out of mind
(Yeah, right)
Once again back it's the incredible
Subliminal the inFredible D

Once down in the dirt
Now I ain't even gotta shave when I'm goin' to work
A'ight looks like I'm drinkin' tonight
Tomorrow I'll be sippin' on some Pedialite, c'mon

Rock, rock to the planet rock, don't stop
(C'mon, c'mon)
Rock, rock to the planet rock, don't stop
(C'mon, c'mon)

Ain't it funny how time flies, huh
Chit chatter, that shit don't matter
(It don't matter)
Check the flow I organically grow
Like the weed I for sheezy be lettin' ya know

Ooh yeah, kinda feelin' horny
Who that is? What it say? What it look like?
Twenty eyes in my head misfit
And I ain't never gonna change
(C'mon)

Don't think you know what the hell I'm all about
(Phenomenon)

Don't think you got my shit all figured out

(Ching)
Rollin' like your pimpin'

But you aint really got shit goin'
'Cuz you ain't limpin' like the Bizkit
(Yeah)
You're just sittin' on the sidelines
You just a fake kid if there's a title then I'll take it
