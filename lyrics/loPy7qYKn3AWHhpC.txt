Alison Goldfrapp:
Pumpkin
you're hollow within
More how I'm to slowly
let their harm
Give us some
It's sad until
Like flowers untamed
Shine out ends
I find what will make him
Love me
Life is our find
Hollow is he

Tricky:
I can't breathe and I can't see
MTV moves too fast, I refuse to understand
You go your way and I'll see mine
Feels like wasted time
And it feels like I must be blind
How'd you like yourself?
You don't know yourself

Alison Goldfrapp:
To a hollow kind, don't mind
Love is some of you
Don't dabble in fall of failure
How bad, ooh, ooh

Tricky and Alison Goldfrapp:
I smell of she and I fail to be
Well anyway, well anyway, well anyway

Alison Goldfrapp:
See how high
Go on

Tricky:
I can't see and I can't breathe
I can't see and I can't breathe
I can't see and I can't breathe
I can't see and I can't breathe
Well anyway, well anyway
