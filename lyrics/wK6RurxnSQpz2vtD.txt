Everyone gets lost in the wilderness sometimes,
but these woods are turning to brick and grime.
Try thinking of life existing outside.
A sky that isn't filled with steel and plaster.
Day in. Day out. Day in. Day out.
These animals have only base desires,
after being stripped of their spirit and fire.
Their rotting bones and their gaping jaws,
they're weeping alone in the bathroom stalls.
I can't help but blend into this institution,
so far gone in this industrial revolution.
Ambition erodes down to basic needs.
Gone are the days of my existential greed.
These aching joints all blend into machinery,
endless tension compounding my humility.
I know they only think of me as another failing product line.
Day in. Day out. Day in. Day out.
