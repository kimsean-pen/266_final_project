Bad news, bad news
I heard you're packin' to leave
I come a-runnin' right over
I just couldn't believe it
I just couldn't believe it

Oh, baby, baby
You must be out of your mind
Do you know what you're kickin' away?
We've got a groovy thing goin', baby
Got a groovy thing

I never done you no wrong
Never hit you when you're down
Always gave you good lovin'
I never ran around
I never ran around

Oh, baby, baby
You must be out of your mind
Do you know what you're kickin' away?
We've got a groovy thing goin', baby
Got a groovy thing

There's somethin' you ought to know
If you're fixin' to go
I can't make it without you
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Oh, baby, baby
You must be out of your mind
Do you know what you're kickin' away?
We've got a groovy thing goin', baby
Got a groovy thing
We've got a groovy thing goin', baby
Got a groovy thing
We've got a groovy thing goin', baby
Got a groovy thing
