And you're all found out
Put your hands where I can see them
I love how I believe them now
When you're all shook up
And you worry baby
It might make me stray but we'll just
Take a walk in the park
I never thought you were empty of dark
The flaw in your lie echoed in mine
Hold on tight here comes the light

Baby took a fall from grace
But it never mattered any way
What d'you think my love is for
I don't need it watered down
I can take you neat if you were ever in doubt
Meet me at the serpent's house

Looking crazy in
A daisy dress I'd be in
Morning through to evening
Before the apple tree
I sensed your loving coming
Same routine you're slumming it
If you think that's love
You're coming up following your lungs
A piece of pie If the cherry ripe
A long way round for a little lie

Baby took a fall from grace
But it never mattered any way
What d'you think my love is for
I don't need it watered down
I can take you neat if you were ever in doubt
Meet me at the serpent's house

Only wanna break
You down, you down
Only wanna break
You down, you down
Only wanna break
You down, you down
Only wanna break
You down, you down

Baby took a fall from grace
But it never mattered any way
What d'you think my love is for
You can have it watered down
You can have it easy, you can have it right now
But you'll be missing out

Baby took a fall from grace
But it never mattered any way
What d'you think my love is for
I don't need it watered down
I can take you neat if you were ever in doubt
Meet me at the serpent's house
