Eyes down don't you gaze on others
Pay no mind to hopeful lovers
Promise to be faithful when you go, go, go, go
Don't be alarmed to discover
Siren songs can pull you under
Promise to be faithful when you go, go, go, go

On the seas of mass temptation
Keep your course of moderation
Promise to be faithful when you go, go, go, go
And if you prove a lying coward
Feel the wrath of higher powers
Promise to be faithful when you go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go

Fade
Writhe, crash, peel
I'm feeling it, the feel of it, the wheel can turn, the wick is lit
I feel like something before I feel like nothing

Crawling through the clouds that morph into mouths
Agree to be swallowed, ignore being hollowed out

Facilitate the power trip
I like to watch you deal with it
Savor every little bit of knowledge you obtain

Don't you hurt me again
Pride, feed me pride, I'm fiending
My mind and my body won't be able to take the pain (You can never ever diss on this dick, you can barely even write this shit)
I'd rather you were dead (More, give it more conejo)
Than lying, cheating, draining my patience away (Feed it pieces, make it sleepy)

Eyes down, don't you gaze on others
Pay no mind to vicious lovers (I think you're perfect, I'm worth it, yeah I deserve to be a servant)
When you go, go, go, go

Act so blind to rediscover
Siren songs can pull you under (I think you're perfect, I'm worth it, yeah I deserve to be a servant)
When you go, go, go, go, go

Say I'm worth it
I'm your person
So well versed in
I'll immerse in you

Filled with regret
Alone in the end
Barely a man
I ran from every decision

Not about to justify, don't sympathize with my meltdown
Not about to justify, don't sympathize with my meltdown
I don't need a friend I'd rather keep it all to myself now
'Cause it's hard enough to follow up the fees of my self-doubt

I had it all in the palm of my hand
Don't have the time to start over again
I had it all in the palm of my hand
Ran out of time now it's over again

Dive through the heart of a demon
Shine a light on my kingdom portrait
Fly straight over the pieces of you
Suck sludge straight through the straw I need you

Fade
Fade
Fade
Fade
Fade into the grave
