The wings that take this sparrow break with this weight of mine
Another message lost into the void of time

Does anybody out there get the message that I send
Would anybody read it then send it back again
A call to mend connection lost through memory and bone
A call to find a new way to communicate and grow

I sold my voice to pay for my security
Now I write my sentence on its walls

I'm calling
Is anybody else out there
Is anybody tuning in

One thousand years had I waited for a sign
A dream may last just seconds, changing you for all time
Frantic, incoherent, just a reach in the dark
A message for my lonely thoughts a sparrow for my heart

I'm calling
Is anybody else out there
Is anybody listening
Can anybody hear me

Wings that take this sparrow break with this weight of mine

I'm calling
Is anybody else out there
Is anybody listening
Can anybody save me
The wings that take this sparrow break with this weight of mine
Another message lost straight from this heart of mine
A message out to anybody tuning in
That this whole world is slowly caving in
