You say you're a refugee of the long term loving scene
As you stole your kiss from me, but how different could I be

To the others, you've been hating
Broken lovers, but it's all over now
All the others, you've been hating
Broken lovers, but it's all over now
Fallen love

Can you feel it
Can you feel it's burning in our minds
Just believe it
Just believe in it once in your lifetime
Can you feel it
Can you feel it's burning in our minds
Just believe it
Just believe in it once in your lifetime

You say I'm the reckless one
So you shy away from love
But I know how long you gonna run
From the things that you want in life

All the others, you've been hating
Broken lovers, but it's all over now
Fallen love

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it burning in our minds?
Just believe it
Just believe it once and a lifetime

Fallen love?

Can you feel it
Can you feel it's burning in our minds
Just believe it
Just believe in it once in your lifetime
Can you feel it
Can you feel it's burning in our minds
Just believe it
Just believe in it once in your lifetime
