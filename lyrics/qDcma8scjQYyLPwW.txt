Here's another pity
And there's another chance
Try to learn a lesson
But you can't.
If we can burn a city
In futures and in past,
Without a change our lives will never last.
Cause we're going fast.

You can sit beside me when the world comes down,
If it doesn't matter then just turn around.
We don't need our bags and we can just leave town.
You can sit beside me when the world comes down.

What can we do better,
When will we know how?
A man says from a sidewalk to a crowd.
If we can change the weather,
If you wanted to yourself.
And if you can't I guess we all need help, yeah,
I need help.

You can sit beside me when the world comes down,
If it doesn't matter then just turn around.
We don't need our bags and we can just leave town.
You can sit beside me when the world comes down.

We say
And we do
All the lies
The truth
And all I need is next to me.

Yeah, we're going fast.

You can sit beside me when the world comes down,
If it doesn't matter then just turn around.
Will you be the queen? And I'll be your clown
You can sit beside me when the world comes down.
You can sit beside me when the world comes
You can sit beside me when the world comes down.
