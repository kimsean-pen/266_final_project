She passes by
We lock our eyes close
Together your face is dry but so is mine Got a lot in common growin up
Is not for us let's make it last ramble on
Teen years have almost come and gone
Twisted memories are for me hiding
Out beneath the trees the movie stars
Are bigger than we are but not by much
Cause youthful days
Have pleanty of laughs
When i look back
