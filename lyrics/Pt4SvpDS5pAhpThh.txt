In the other room, I'm the other girl
I'm another one of your children
It's this other face, this other name
I'm the other girl (want to be in the other room)
When you're calling me, when you're calling me

Your gift receiving through this
Body of mine is alive, so alive
Your gift receiving through this
Body of mine is alive, so alive

I am bleeding joy, still peaceful
I am waiting for patience
I live something beautiful
Just thinking not too fast
I'm still here (want to be in the other room)
When you're calling me, when you're calling me

Your gift receiving through this
Body of mine is alive, so alive
Your gift receiving through this
Body of mine is alive, so alive

My secrets are now
Things I can touch
This is complicity
I'm going to embrace
This man with no face, just fly

Your gift receiving through this
Body of mine is alive, so alive
Your gift shining through this
Body of mine is alive, so alive
Your gift is giving, as receiving, is receiving
