You speak in tongues I can't resist
You run me 'round I cannot think
We're driving to your parents house just for a visit and I'm sleeping in your brother's bed
Won't you sneak into my room and climb under the covers talk nonsense in your sleep

You come unguarded once again
And I can't wait to let you in
We're driving to your parents house just for a visit and I'm sleeping in your brother's bed
Won't you sneak into my room and climb under the covers talk nonsense in your sleep

You've got some charm I must admit
Don't let me wreck myself again
Driving to your parents house just for a visit and I'm sleeping in your brother's bed
Won't you sneak into my room and climb under the covers talk nonsense in your sleep
