Would you believe me when I tell you
You are the king of my dreams
Please don't decieve me when I hurt you
It just ain't the way it seems

Can't you hear my love buzz?
Can't you hear my love buzz?
Can't you hear my love buzz?

I need you like a desert needs rain
I would rather like to die
Darling I hurt when I do not see you
So spead your wings and fly

Can't you hear my love buzz?
Can't you hear my love buzz?
Can't you hear my love buzz?
