If I stay,
I know that I must share your love
And that I couldn't take.
And if I go,
We'll be apart and I know my heart would surely break.
So, what
Difference does it make, which one I choose?
Either way I lose.

Though I know, my love is true.
I'd die if you ever told me good-bye. Ever told
Me good-bye.
And I know, she loves you too.
She would do, the same as I.
What difference does it make, which one I choose?
Either way I lose.
Either way I lose.
EIther way I lose.
