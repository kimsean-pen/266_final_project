As the lukewarm hands of the gods
Came down and gently picked my adrenalin pearls
Placed them in their mouths and rinsed all the fear out
Nourished them with their saliva

All rested

As if the healthiest pastime
Is being in life-threatening circumstances
And once again be reborn
All birthed and happy (all birthed and happy)
All birthed and happy (all birthed and happy)
All birthed and happy (all birthed and happy)

Best way to start-a-new is to fail miserably
Fail at loving and fail at giving
Fail at creating a flow then realign the whole
And kick into the starthole.

And kick into the starthole
And kick into the starthole

To risk all is the end all and the beginning all
To risk all is the end all and the beginning all
