Keepin' my mouth shut, 'cause I couldn't tell you
Everything I saw when I was still a boy in school
I was still a boy in school

Sometimes I feel like I've gone insane,
'Cause I can't change my mind,
But I can't stay the same
Except you
I still feel the same about you

I can't help but dream about your song
Your voice in my head makes me feel numb
You say:

I'm at home, I'm waiting on ya
Drove all the way from California
I'm at home, I'm waiting on ya
I knew I couldn't live without ya
I'm at home, I'm waiting on ya
Drove all the way from California
I'm at home, I'm waiting on ya
I knew I couldn't live without ya

Some other people, won't make a sound
So many people looking for something to do
We're all looking for something to do
I feel annoying most of the time, but I keep on talking
Just to keep my mind off you
Just to keep my mind off you

I can't help but dream about your song
Your voice in my head makes me feel numb
You say:

I'm at home, I'm waiting on ya
Drove all the way from California
I'm at home, I'm waiting on ya
I knew I couldn't live without ya
I'm at home, I'm waiting on ya
Drove all the way from California
I'm at home, I'm waiting on ya
I knew I couldn't live without ya

I'm at home, I'm waiting
I'm at home, I'm waiting on ya
I'm at home, I'm waiting
I'm at home, I'm waiting on ya
I'm at home, I'm waiting
I'm at home, I'm waiting on ya
I'm at home, I'm waiting
I'm at home, I'm waiting on ya
I'm at home, I'm waiting
I'm at home, I'm waiting on ya
I'm at home, I'm waiting
I'm at home, I'm waiting on ya
I'm at home, I'm waiting
I'm at home, I'm waiting on ya
I'm at home, I'm waiting
I'm at home, I'm waiting on ya
