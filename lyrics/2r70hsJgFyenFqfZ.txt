I'm a crescent moon
Looking for a place to lay my head and settle in
Never found a refuge up there in the sky,
But never thought it would be you and I

Was there anyone
Able to remain alive upon this place?
Space is only precious when I'm filling in
All the spaces waiting to be filled

Waxing and waning

So feel me
Pulling all your oceans up around my body
And if it should ever let me leave this place too soon
You'll always know that I'm the crescent moon
