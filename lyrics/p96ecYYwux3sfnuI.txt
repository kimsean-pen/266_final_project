Your spit, a well a lies
Ferment the nights we cried
These days are wasted light
These days are wasted light

You have the eyes of hate
It's a constant stream
The language of your eyes
I begin to see

I wanna fly away
I'm torn away
I lie still awake
Hymns of my wake

I want to start again
(It's in my head)
I see myself again
(Since the day I was born)

I fly away

Lost in this world
What holds dear?
I feel I'm losing grip
I fail them now

This fear is everlasting
These eyes have run dry
My coarse feels the toll
I put up these walls

Please don't fail me now
Let the sun shine again
Please don't fail me
