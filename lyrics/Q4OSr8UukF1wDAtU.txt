Lost in the dark I feel like a shadow of myself
I'm not what I was I keep looking for
Another second chance to get me... clean

Elevate me take me higher
I don't wanna be wasted
I've got nothing left to lose
It's a little known fact
I see everything black and I don't wanna face it
Elevate me take me higher

The smoke and the dust has taken me in and over my head
No one to trust I'm feeling like I'm closer than I was to the... end

Elevate me take me higher
I don't wanna be wasted
I've got nothing left to lose
It's a little known fact I see
Everything black and I don't wanna face it
Elevate me take me higher

I'm tired of taking the test, don't test me
My troubled mind is a mess
You know I'm... I'm only doing my best to be set free

Elevate me take me higher
I don't wanna be wasted
I've got nothing left to lose
It's a little known fact I see
Everything black and I don't wanna face it
Elevate me take me higher
