Scream, shout
Turn it out
Feelin' what you all about
You can make the energy light up where you are
Fast, slow, make it go
Anyway you want it to

We can make or break it
Just get inside the car
We can be here all night
Tripping on the moonlight
Baby, we can chill
Right up against the stars

Loving you is easy
Baby, please believe me
There's so many reasons why
You're my favorite girl
You're my favorite girl
You're my favorite girl
You're my favorite girl
'Cause you rock my world

(World, world, world, world...)
'Cause you rock my world
(World, world, world, world...)

I see you and me
Can you feel this synergy?
They don't understand it, but
Baby, that's all right

No way
It's OK!
We gone just accelerate
I don't need my vision
'Cause, girl, you're outta sight

We can be here all night
Tripping on the moonlight
Baby, we can chill
Right up against the stars

Loving you is easy
Baby, please believe me
There's so many reasons why
We can be here all night
Tripping on the moonlight
Baby, we can chill
Right up against the stars
Loving you is easy
Baby, please believe me
There's so many reasons why
You're my favorite girl
You're my favorite girl
You're my favorite girl
You're my favorite girl
'Cause you rock my world

(World, world, world, world...)
'Cause you rock my world
(World, world, world, world...)

Fast, slow, make it go
Anyway you want it to
We can make or break it
Just get inside my car

Scream, shout
Turn it out
