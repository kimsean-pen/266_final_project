Always hear you singing,
I can't stand that song.
You like my hair brunette,
But I like it blonde.

You lie in the sunshine,
But it makes me sweat.
You save all your money,
While I get into debt.

Not the kinda guy to catch my eye,
Now we're picking out the tiles and curtains.
Never thought you'd be the lucky guy,
Now it's the only thing I know for certain.
Used to go for guys who make me cry,
Never seem to find the rhyme or reason.
If you love somebody, don't ask why,
Cupid mystifies.

Oh, when they say love's the key,
An end of the road,
It don't matter to me,
Worth that man hanging on hold.
The answer is love,
And no reason why,
It knows where you been
But you and me just seem to fit right.

I'm mocha-chocca latte,
You're espresso shot.
Life and soul of the party,
It's safe to say you're not.

I lean towards fiction,
But you deal with fact.
Don't mind the friction,
'Cause opposites attract.

Not the kinda guy to catch my eye,
Now we're picking out the tiles and curtains.
Never thought you'd be the lucky guy,
Now it's the only thing I know for certain.
Used to go for guys who make me cry,
Never seem to find the rhyme or reason.
If you love somebody, don't ask why,
Cupid mystifies.

Oh, when they say love's the key,
An end of the road,
It don't matter to me,
Worth that man hanging on hold.

And no reason why,
It knows where you been
But you and me just seem to fit right.
