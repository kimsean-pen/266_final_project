Call me on the dark side, call me through the moonlight
Running in the midnight, yeah
Dancing to the flames, I wanna stay high
Wanna stay high, do it my way
I just tell wanna tell lies to your green eyes
Your green eyes, okay
Ranging to the midnight, midnight
'Til the sun don't rise again

I'm feeling like fever, burning through the night
Tear you open, tear you open, see what's inside
Feeling like fever, baby you know I'm right
I'm right

We don't got no consequences, yeah
We tear shit up 'cause we just don't feel the end
Feeling like fever, fever, yeah
We ain't got no consequences, yeah
We burn it down like Caesar and do it again
Feeling like fever, fever, yeah

What lurks underneath the surface?
Is it worth it? I am nervous
Swimming into the deep blue
The deep is the blue secret

I'm feeling like fever, burning through the night
Tear you open, tear you open, see what's inside
Feeling like fever, baby you know I'm right
I'm right

We don't got no consequences, yeah
We tear shit up 'cause we just don't feel the end
Feeling like fever, fever, yeah
We ain't got no consequences, yeah
We burn it down like Caesar and do it again
Feeling like fever, fever yeah
