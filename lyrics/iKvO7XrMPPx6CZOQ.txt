he met her in the fall, he took her to a movie
and when they'd done it all, he took her to a movie
and from the hospital, he took her to a movie
but so did I

and when her heart was sad, he took her to a movie
she's all he's ever had, he took her to a movie
and should their love turn bad, he took her to a movie
but so did I

I think she's been alone, he took her to a movie
when they cut off the phone, he took her to a movie
and when her cover's blown, he took her to a movie
but so did I

there's nothing on TV, he took her to a movie
but she's the one for me, he took her to a movie
we're at number three, he took her to a movie
but so did I
