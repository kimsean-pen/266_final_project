She hath no life but the one he for her wrought;
Proffer'd to her his wauking heart - she turn'd it down,

'Or was he an éri'd being,
'Or was he weening - alack nay mo;
Her naysay' raught his heart,

She beli'd her own words,
He thought her life, save moreo'er scourge,
She held him august, yet wee;
He left her ne'er without his heart.
