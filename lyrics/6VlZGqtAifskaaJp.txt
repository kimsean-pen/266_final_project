I thought I saw your eyes
Laced in smoke & cigarette curls
I thought I saw your eyes
But I'm seeing ghosts tonight

She haunts me!
'Til my bitter end
She haunts me!

I swear I heard your voice, overwhelmed by conversation
I swear I heard your voice but I'm hearing ghosts tonight!
The bars turn out their lights
And I drink away the day as it decays

So much for living forever
So much for death do us part

She haunts me!
She haunts me!
She haunts me!
Every fucking...
Night!
