I walked across a crowded street
a sea of eyes cut through me, and I saw you in the middle.
your upset face, you wear it well,
you camouflage the way you feel when every thing's the matter
we've all been down that road before,
searching for that something more.

worlds are spinning round
theres no sign of slowing down,
so won't you take a breath,
just take a breath.
people change and promises are broken.
clouds can move and skies will be wide open.
don't forget to take a breath.

blink our eyes, life's rearranged.
to our surprise, it's still okay.
it's the way things happen.
summer comes and then it goes.
hold on tight and brace for cold
and its only for a moment
we've all been down that road before,
searching for that something more

worlds are spinning round
theres no sign of slowing down,
so won't you take a breath,
just take a breath.
people change and promises are broken.
clouds can move and skies will be wide open.
don't forget to take a breath.

life isn't suffocating
air isn't overrated

worlds are spinning round
theres no sign of slowing down,
so won't you take a breath,
just take a breath. (x2)

people change and promises are broken.
clouds can move and skies will be wide open.
don't forget to take a breath.

worlds are spinning round
theres no sign of slowing down,
so won't you,
dont forget to take a breath.
