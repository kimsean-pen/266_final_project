It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose

Oh yeah!
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose

It's the music that we choose

The world is spinning too fast

I'm buying lead Nike shoes
To keep myself tethered
To the days I try to lose
My mama said to slow down
You must make your own shoes
Stop dancing to the music
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood

Keep a mild groove on

Day doo day bop
Day doo day bop
Day doo day bop
Day doo day bop

Day doo day bop
Day doo day bop
Day doo day bop
Day doo day bop

There you go!
Get the cool!

Get the cool shoeshine!
Get the cool!
Get the cool shoeshine!
Get the cool!
Get the cool shoeshine!
Get the cool!
Get the cool shoeshine!

There's a monkey in the jungle
Watching a vapour trail
Caught up in the conflict
Between his brain and his tail
And if time's elimination
Then we got nothing to lose
Please repeat the message
It's the music that we choose
Keepen my groove on

Day dee dah bop
Day doo day bop
Day doo day bop
Day doo day bop
Day doo day bop
Day doo day bop
Day doo day bop

Get the cool!
