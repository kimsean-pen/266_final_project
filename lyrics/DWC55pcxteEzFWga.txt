I wanna do something! What'd you wanna do?
Dance!
I wanna do something special with you.
I've been a having a boring life lately, so now I wanna be a boy with a ADD.

I wanna meet a girl. Which girl?
She's shy, she's sensitive!
So now I'm taking her down to the dance floor,
I'm holding her hand and my plan is to touch her...

I'm touching you, you're touching me, (x3)
You're touching me, I'm touching you. (x2)

So we are standing and dancing and laughing when suddenly she turns around
and dances with another guy.
I'm thinking "ok, is that the game you wanna play?"
I'll find myself another girl.

I'm watching her, she's watching me,
I'm thinking this is not the way it's supposed to be.
That's why I'm making a move, and I move with the groove,
and I ask her to touch me.

I'm touching you, you're touching me, (x3)
You're touching me, I'm touching you. (x2)

Lights come on, security says "Get out of here!"
I'm standing out in the rain and you are nowhere.
This guy comes over to me and says, "do you wanna be with me and my
friends on this crazy after party?"

As I cross the floor, they are playing The Cure,
you're standing by the door, I'm walking over
So I give you a wink, and my drink, in a blink you turn pink,
and then we sandwich on the dance floor!

I'm touching you, you're touching me, (x3)
You're touching me, I'm touching you. (x2)
