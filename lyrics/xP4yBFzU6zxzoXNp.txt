It's not in the way that you told me
It's not in the way you say you care
It's not in the way you've been treatin' my friends
It's not in the way that you stay till the end
It's not in the way you look
Or the things that you say that you'll do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time... whoa, whoa, whoa
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time... whoa, whoa, whoa
It's not in the words that you told me, Babe
It's not in the way you say you're mine, ooooh

It's not in the way that you came back to me
It's not in the way that your love set me free
It's not in the way you look
Or the things that you say that you'll do
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time... whoa, whoa, whoa

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time... whoa, whoa, whoa

It's not in the words that you told me
It's not in the way you say you're mine, ooooh
It's not in the way that you came back to me

It's not in the way that your love set me free
It's not in the way you look
Or the things that you say that you'll do
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time... whoa, whoa, whoa
Hold the line

Love isn't always on time, Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always, Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Whoa, whoa, whoa
