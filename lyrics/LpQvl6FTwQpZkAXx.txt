Oh oh oh oh oh oh

For once I hit the spot real early
Quickly spotted this beautiful girlie
She had me going damn oh la la
Said she wanna peel my banana na na
Took her to my cabana
Had to pull her g string like Santana
Have a zip of this no manana
Next thing I gotta ask do you wanna?
Voulez vous you know the rest
Merci beaucoup she said and got undressed
I want it all and nothing less
Roll up in the spot and got the best once again

I got another one one one one
Ain't no way I'm gonna come come come come
Back to the club to the party I got what I came for
You still searchin the floor
I got another one one one one
Ain't no way I'm gonna come come come come
Back to the club to the party I got what I came for
You still lookin for more

Guys coming out club empty handed
No girl cursing like god dammit
Went and spent your rent money on nada
Can't even fix your broke Lada
My girl drippin in Prada
Pass you one cause I got a hole lotta
Come on over here let me show
You how to get it in many nights in a row
Just say, Voulez vous you know the rest
Merci beaucoup she said and got undressed
I want it all and nothing less
Roll up in the spot and got the best once again

I got another one one one one
Ain't no way I'm gonna come come come come
Back to the club to the party I got what I came for
You still searchin the floor
I got another one one one one
Ain't no way I'm gonna come come come come
Back to the club to the party I got what I came for
You still lookin for more

It's so hard for me to pick
There's so much to choose from
All this candy makes me sick
But I'm still gonna have some
Monday, Tuesday Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday Sunday
All that I know is that when I saw you girl

I got another one one one one
Ain't no way I'm gonna come come come come
Back to the club to the party I got what I came for
You still searchin the floor
I got another one one one one
Ain't no way I'm gonna come come come come
Back to the club to the party I got what I came for
You still lookin for more

I got the baddest chic on the island
Best believe she's got this man smiling
You can stay all night
But you ain't getting what I got
No you're not no no you not ey
No you're not no no you not ey
No you're not no no you not ey
No you're not no no you not ey
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
