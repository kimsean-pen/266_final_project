I see a glimmer
Across the wall, through the mirror
Out past the streets, beyond the weather
To that place no one seems to know

Off-key dreams
That you're living in
Smiling skulls, ghosts are grinning
Power lines spark their singing
Drone song blues makes me want to go

All goes up and now it's gone
I have never known you but just hang on

Love just like thunder
Hits the ground, rings upon my head
Split that rock, pull me under
My alarm is set so I'll be out of bed

All goes up and now it's gone
I have never known you but just hang on

I see a glimmer
Across the wall, through the mirror
Out past the streets, beyond the weather
To that place no one seems to know
