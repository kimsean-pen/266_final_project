Suddenly, the ground gives way
The spirit moves down the hall
Fate reveals the dark remains
Of faith in its last resolve

Left behind those who wait
For answers that will not come
Out of time, out of place
Into the great
The great beyond

In denial, the seed and son
The one who will pay the most
Will revile the one he loves
Too bitter to let this go

Faith in time will decay
This tragedy will live on
Love inside slips away
Into the great
The great beyond

Now all we've seen or thought to be was just a dream
All we've seen or thought to be is gone
All we've seen or thought to be was just a dream
The sky rips open taking all we've ever known away

And the funeral songs welcome the early dawn
One more ghost slips away into the great beyond
As the pyre burns on, the pale rider won't be long
To push open the gates into the great beyond
The great beyond
