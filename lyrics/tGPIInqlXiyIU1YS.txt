How do you break through
When the words don't meet your lips
And lump inside your throat
Or in a pile of could've beens
All the small talk and the catch up and the empty promises
How do you dive deeper
In a shallow riverbed
When the current pulls you further
From what you should've said

Getting by on the kindness of strangers
Getting by on the kindness of strangers

When you're trying to be tender
But instead you come off cold
When your sweetness surrenders
To the cruelness of this world
All the small stuff and the bad luck
When it all becomes too much
How do you find solace
In a place so quick to judge
Do you try and play it cool
Play the part you think they want

Getting by on the kindness of strangers
Getting by on the kindness of strangers
(Kindness of strangers)
(Kindness of strangers)

People come and people go
And some will make their mark
Like an iron to the bowl
A cymbal in your heart
And the ones that stick around
Are the hardest ones to find
And if you can't find the closest
You need the kindness to survive

Getting by on the kindness of strangers
Getting by on the kindness of strangers
Getting by (kindness of strangers)
Getting by (kindness of strangers)
(Kindness of strangers)
(Kindness of strangers)
