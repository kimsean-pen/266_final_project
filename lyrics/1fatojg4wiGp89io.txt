What is the purpose?
Demonoid phenomenon
Regulate the flux and reflux
So get it on
Loose upon the world
Destruct like a juggernaut

Give it to me! Yeah! Yeah!

Suddenly the rats are high
Bleed the masses watch them cry
Slumber like Houdini's dog
Die alone out in the fog

Iron Head
Iron Head
Iron Head
Crucify you

Iron head - regenerate!
Iron head - exterminate!
Iron head - liberate and crucify you!

What is my name?
A demonoid phenomenon
Laugh into your face and
Break and then move along
Vent upon the brink
Appear another demi-god

Yeah! Yeah!

Suddenly forever knows
What it takes and where it goes
Paint it black inside your head
I defy what you have said!

Iron Head
Iron Head
Iron Head
Crucify you

Iron head - regenerate!
Iron head - exterminate!
Iron head - liberate and crucify you!

Suddenly the rats are high
Bleed the masses watch them cry
Slumber like Houdini's dog
Die alone out in the fog

Iron Head
Iron Head
Iron Head
Crucify you

Iron head - regenerate!
Iron head - exterminate!
Iron head - liberate and crucify you!
