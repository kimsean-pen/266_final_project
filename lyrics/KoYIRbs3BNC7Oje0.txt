Could I maybe be a little bit more naive?
Slide my shoes off my feet and rest myself in that seat
I call at one. At two. At three
I'm drunk and hard and half asleep
Someone is out there
It's more than I can bare
Now shifting from side to side playing along
Still hanging up furious when somebody answers the phone
Alone alone alone alone alone alone
But I know where to go
