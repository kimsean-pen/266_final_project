Everybody groove to the music
Everybody jam

...
Ahhh, uh oh, hey
...
We've been waiting so long
Just can't hold it back no more
Creepin' up and down now
It's time for me to let it go

...
If you really wanna see
What we can do for you
Send the crazy wildin' static
Sing it (ahhh)
Jam on 'cause Backstreet's got it

Come on now everybody
We've got it goin' on for years

Jam on 'cause Backstreet's got it
Come on now everybody
We've got it goin' on for years
Ahhh, uh oh, hey
We've got it goin' on for years
oh baby
We've got it goin' on for years
Well I'm creepin' up on your left

Straight up funky when I get with you
I get ruthless when I get wet
Keep the party packed in my corner

Tough like granite to keep the crowd hype
Get up on this just to get right
What you want is what you're gonna get
Backstreet's got the special effects, uh
If you really wanna see
What we can do for you

Send a crazy wildin' static
Sing it (ahhhh)

Jam on 'cause Backstreet's got it
Come on now everybody
We've got it goin' on for years
Jam on 'cause Backstreet's got it
Come on now everybody
We've got it goin' on for years

Ahhh, uh oh, hey

We've got it goin' on for years
(We've got it goin' on)
...
Hey, hey, yeah

We've got it goin' on for years
We've been waiting so long
Just can't hold it back no more (ohhhh)
Creepin' up and down now
It's time for me to let it go
It's time for me to let it go

...
Jam on, jam on
...
Everybody grove to the music
Everybody jam (uh oh) (ahhh)
Everybody grove to the music
Everybody jam (uh oh) (ahhh)
Jam on 'cause Backstreet's got it (Everybody grove to the music)
