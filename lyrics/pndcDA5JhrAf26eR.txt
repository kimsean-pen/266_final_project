You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
You're nobody 'til somebody cares

You may be king, you may possess the world
And it's gold but gold won't bring you
Happiness when you're growing old

The world still is the same
You'll never change it
As sure as the stars shine above

You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody to love

The world still is the same
You'll never change it
As sure as the stars shine above

Well, you're nobody 'til somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody to love
