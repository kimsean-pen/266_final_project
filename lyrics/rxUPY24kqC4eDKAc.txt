Hiding yourself away
Seeing the truth too late
It's not matter anymore, no
No lie you're heading for

And when it's too dark to see
Open up your eyes and talk to me
You and me we're living in symmetry
The only thing that matters we'll come to be
Together when the wave breaks
Together when the wave breaks

Everything will let in
To the quiet look in your eyes
The shadows are dark and fierce in me
We'll wake up but feel alive (washing over)
As the sunrise clears the sky

But when it's too dark to see
Open up your eyes and hold on to me
You and me we're living in symmetry
I see you, it's a mirror looks back at me
Shining when the rest is too dark to see
Step yourself, come on hold on to me
'Cause you and me we're living in symmetry
The only thing that matters we'll come to be
Together when the wave breaks

Hold on now, don't chase to lie
Hold on now
Hold on now, don't chase to lie
Hold on now

But when it's too dark to see
Open up your eyes and hold on to me
You and me we're living in symmetry
I see you, it's a mirror looks back at me
Shining when the rest is too dark to see
Step yourself, come on hold on to me
'Cause you and me we're living in symmetry
The only thing that matters we'll come to be
Together when the wave breaks
