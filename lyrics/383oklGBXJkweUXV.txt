I never wanted
And I never cared before

I never wanted
And I never cared before
Take it back, this is a new day
I never wanted
And I never cared before
Take it back, this isâ€¦

How I long to regress
To the days before I took upon myself
The obsessions of this world (for tomorrow)
A day of innocence equatting beauty (may fall)
Is already gone (and today)
Today is already (is already)
Gone
Tomorrow may fall
Today is already gone

Take it back, this is a new day
I never wanted (this is a new day)
And I never cared before
I never wanted (I never wanted)
And I never cared before

I've grown tired of chasing
Convinced I was in need
And now the years I've spent
Only a slave to this

Tomorrow may fall
And today is already gone
I will no longer adore these things
That will never satisfy me

I've seen my world change
And then go back to where it came
In this vicious circle
We are all brought back to life
Only to die
In this vicious circle
We are all brought back to life
Only to die (again)
I have seen my (in this vicious circle)
My world change (we are all)
And then go back (brought back to life)
Back to where it came (only to die)
But without these (in this vicious circle)
Barren obsessions (we are all)
I am simply (brought back to life)
I am simply free (only to die)

I've seen my world change
And then go back to where it came
