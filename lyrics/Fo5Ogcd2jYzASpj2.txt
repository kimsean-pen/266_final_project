Eighth grade, I feel depressed as shit
Cuz my heart is in the future and I know where I belong
It just takes time
Fast forward, now I'm twenty-two
Half a million after taxes just to make a couple songs and I don't mind
Eighth grade I feel depressed as shit
I'll be a fuckin' Warhol with this beat pad, let me paint and hone my craft
It just takes time
Fast forward now I'm twenty two
Making artists feel self-conscious from the honesty and soul and
I don't mind
