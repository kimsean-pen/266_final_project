Keep your hands to yourself, these lips belong to someone else
And you know that you will never get on it
Keep your lies to yourself, every lie you heard from someone else
And you know that you will never get with it

Well, I sussed you good, you knew I would
Oh haven't you heard you're just a mark on my shirt?
Another night and another girl
Well, I taste so good, you knew I would

So who's keeping score on who is a whore?
With you by my side, that look in your eye
I hope you don't

Go home and wash your jeans 'cause there's dirt on the knees
Your jealously doesn't sit with me
You love, I love you too, below the waist I'll start charging you
'Cause that's just how the players play the game
My winning streak is missing

So who's keeping score on who is a whore?
With you by my side, that look in your eye
I hope you don't

So who's keeping score on who is a whore?
With you by my side, that look in your eye
I hope you don't
And you whore

Oh, I'll save it for the, save it for the backdoor
