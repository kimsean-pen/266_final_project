You know that you like it
You know that you love it, really

It? s just a game that we play
It? s a world away from your everyday pain
And your suffering
It? s just a game, my darling please

Please, don? t go to the trouble
No, no, not on account of me
For I? m sure to bring double
Sure to bring double
I'll bring you to your knees
Might you be getting off on it?

You, you were asking for this
And now, you? re gonna get it
You were beggin' me, please
Don? t be surprised if you

One big joke
I'll just all one big joke
It? s all mirrors and smoke
A not so elaborate hoax

You know how
One thing tends to lead to another
Before you know where you are
You? re there tied to the chair
Might you be getting off on it

It? s just a game
Not your everyday pain
It? s just a game
Not your everyday pain

It? s just a game
Not your everyday pain
It? s just a game
Not your everyday pain

It? s just a game that we play
It? s a world away from your everyday pain
And you're suffering
It? s just a game

It? s just a game that we play
It? s a world away from your everyday pain
And you're suffering
It? s just a game

Don? t you get off on it
Don? t you get off on it
Don? t you get off on it
Don? t you get off on it

Don? t you get off on it
Don? t you get off on it
Don? t you get off on it

It? s a world away from your everyday pain
And you're suffering
It? s just a game
