I'll fix the strings and play my part
I know the pain that's in your heart
I've tread the distance, near or far
Just wanna be right where you are

I know love has been a stranger to you
Maybe I'm the one to change it for you
Won't be easy 'cause lessons feel new
But the writing on the wall

Love is easy, easy
So don't you make it hard
Can't you see me, see me, see me?
Be easy with my heart
All we got is here and now
Why won't you let your guard down?
I'm just tryna show you how
Love is easy
So don't you make it hard

I'll chase the wind, I'll face your dark
I'll make a wish upon your star
Although you're afraid, I'll be your heart
Just let my hands reach your scars

I know love has been a stranger to you
Maybe I'm the one to change it for you
Won't be easy 'cause lessons feel new
But the writing on the wall

Love is easy, easy
So don't you make it hard
Can't you see me, see me, see me?
Be easy with my heart

Oh, take your time, no need for rushing things
Baby, don't you know that with me, you're safe?
The easy option is to run away, don't run away
To hide from love, oh baby, what would it change?
I been thinking 'bout some bitter days
Lots of pressure, all I'm tryna say is

Love is easy, easy, yeah, yeah
So don't you make it hard
Don't you make it, so don't you make it hard
Can't you see me, see me, see me?
Can't you see me?
Be easy with my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart
All we got is here and now
All we got is here and now
Why won't you let your guard down?
I'm just tryna show you how
Love is easy, so easy, so easy, yeah
So don't you make it hard
Oh, oh
