Take your seats
Hear me speak
You're not alone
In everything

And when the wind blows hard
You'll see, you'll see
And when the wind blows hard
Don't weep, don't weep

So run with the rhythm
Run with your freedom
And run with everything you still have left

I'm not a saint
'Cause I feel pain
Far from home
And I've found hope

So run with the rhythm
Run with your freedom
And run with everything you still have left

And run with the rhythm
Run with your freedom
And run with everything you still have left

So run with the rhythm
Run with your freedom
And run with everything you still have left

And run with the rhythm
Run with your freedom
And run with everything you still have left
