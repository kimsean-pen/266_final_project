And when I was a child
My mother said there were no angels
And now I'm running wild
I see their faces in the strangers
But it's just that time of the night
It's just that time of the night

Now others pass me by
I see their eyes faced to the pavement
I see their trophy lives
I know my place in this is fading
And far too long, far too long I thought the world was changing
Far too long, far too long I spent my young days ageing

Was I too old
To walk this road
I won't slow
I'll sell my soul

Cause it's just that time of the night
It's just that time of the night
It's just that time of the night
It's just that time of the night
