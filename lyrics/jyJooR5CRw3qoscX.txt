I died when you left
Everyone said you were the righteous one
Down the streets that I walk along
Down in the house where I love the walls
Down to the basement with my childhood charms
You came running
We are coming back
'Cause everything is here
We are coming back
'Cause everything is here
Oh here, oh

Seasons, they pass
Everyone says you were a righteous path
Still I live many miles away
So I can miss you a little every day
Back to the house where we lost our way
You came running
We are coming back
'Cause everything is here
We are coming back
'Cause everything is here
Oh here, oh

We are coming back
'Cause everything is here
We are coming back
'Cause everything is here
Oh here, oh
