When I wake up I find you're gone
There should be grief but I feel none
I'm trying to leave the night behind
I hardly get my thoughts in line

But there is one thing I could say
It seems I'm glad, I find you're gone

I find you're gone
I find you're gone

When I wake up I find you're gone
There should be grief but I feel none
I'm trying to leave the night behind
I hardly get my thoughts in line

You know it's wrong, you know the way
But do you really want to stay?
A sudden thought, a thing to mind
It would be only wasting time

No matter how hard you will try
It's just a feeling passing by

I find you're gone
I find you're gone

You know it's wrong, you know the way
But do you really want to stay?
A sudden thought, a thing to mind
It would be only wasting time

I won't say that it's true
That I'm here to stick with you
You know, for me it's just a game
And that you're not the one to blame

I find you're gone
I find you're gone

I find you're gone
I find you're gone

I find you're gone
I find you're gone

I find you're gone
I find you're gone
