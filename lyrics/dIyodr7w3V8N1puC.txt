If there's dancing all night long
Singing songs
If there's dancing all night long

Note my screams of joy
Higher and higher and higher
Note my screams of joy
Higher and higher and higher

Life is suffering, man
Life is suffering, man
Higher and higher and higher

Learning, searching in the night
What is right?
Learning, searching in the night

I have reason and I can knock it
Down
I have reason and I can knock it
Down

Note my screams of joy
Higher and higher and higher
Note my screams of joy
Higher and higher and higher

Life is suffering, man
Life is suffering, man
Higher and higher and higher
