Hello, hello anybody out there?
'Cause I don't hear a sound.
Alone, alone I don't really know where the world is, but I miss it now.
I'm out on the edge and I'm screaming my name like a fool at the top of my lungs.
Sometimes when I close my eyes I pretend I'm all right but it's never enough.
'Cause my echo, echo is the only voice coming back.

Shadow, shadow is the only friend that I have.
Listen, listen I would take a whisper if that's all you had to give.

But it isn't, is it? You could come and save me and try to

chase the crazy right out of my head.
I'm out on the edge and I'm screaming my name like a fool at the top of my lungs.
Sometimes when I close my eyes I pretend I'm all right but it's never enough.

'Cause my echo, echo is the only voice coming back.
Shadow, shadow is the only friend that I have.

I don't wanna be an island, I just wanna feel alive and get to see your face again.
I don't wanna be an island, I just wanna feel alive and get to see your face again.
Once again just my echo, my shadow, you're my only friend.
And I'm out on the edge and I'm screaming my name like a fool at the top of my lungs.
Sometimes when I close my eyes I pretend I'm all right but it's never enough
'Cause my echo, echo.
Oh my shadow, shadow.
Hello, hello anybody out there...
