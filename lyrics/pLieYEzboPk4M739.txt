These half-truths you're telling me
won't bring me to my knees.
Scraped up and brused
from your fickleness I plead.
Just let me feel some ease
from creatures of your greed.
Just let me feel some ease for me.

I'm not so glad I met you,
It makes me want to go away.
So you think its over,
I don't, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Where do we go from here?
You know I'm not the only one.
Where do we go from here?
You know I'm not the only son.

Where do we go from here?
Stop dreaming 'bout that shiny gun.
Where do we go from here?
You know I'm not the only one.

These broken dreams are screams to me,
the difference I can't see.
The way you look and talk to me,
you're cross at me, I freeze.
The combination of lost control,
the loss of soul, I wheeze.
Just give some ease to me.

I'm not so glad I met you,
It makes me want to go away.
