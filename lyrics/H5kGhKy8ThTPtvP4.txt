Welcome aboard ladies and gentleman.
Today's flight will be a little over one hour
Just a few safety precautions before we head off
We ask that you move about the cabin as much as possible,
be sure to loosen those belts, and remember,
all our flights are fitted with smoke detectors so do try not to get caught
We'll be dimming the cabin lights for take-off
Thank you for choosing to fly with Flight Facilities
