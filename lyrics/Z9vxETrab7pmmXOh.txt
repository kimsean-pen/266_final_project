See I reckon you about an eight or a nine
Maybe even nine and a half in 4 beers time
That blue top shirt top youve got on, is nice
Bit too much fake tan though but, yea you score high
But there's just one little thing thats just
really really really annoying me about you, ya see
Yeah yeah like I said, you are really fit
But my gosh! dont you just know it

I'm not trying to pull you
Even tho I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit but my gosh don't you know it

So when I looked at you standing there with your horde
I was waiting in the queue lookin' at the board
Wondering whether to have a burger or chips
Or what the shrapnel in my back pocket could afford
When I noticed out the corner of my eye
Lookin toward my direction your eyes locked on my course
I couldn't concentrate on what I wanted to order
Which lost me my place in the queue I waited for, yeah

Im not trying to pull you
Even tho I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit but my gosh dont you know it

Leave it out
Are you smoking crack or something?
Leave it out
Mike just leave it
We cannot have that behavior in this establishment
Its not worth it mike
Leave it out
Just leave it
Dont touch me im alright
Don't... Look i'm alright...

For a while there I was thinkin, yeah but what if
Picturing myself pulling with bare white-heart witt
Staring at you standing there That was it!
Whether or not you knew it I swear you didn't tick
And when that bloke in the white behind
us lot queing was clocking onto you to it
I had to admit that yea yea you are fit and I do want it
But I stopped sharkin a minute to get chips and drinks

Im not trying to pull you
Even tho I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit but my gosh dont you know it

Now, i bashed my head hard earlier, due to the brew,
But i am digressing slightly so i'll continue
I didnt wanna bowl over all geezer and rude
Not rude like good but just rude like uncouth
You girls think you can just flirt and it comes to you
Well let me tell you see yes yes you are really rude
And rude as in good i knew she said as she queued
But i just did not wanna give the satisfaction to you

Im not trying to pull you
Even tho I would like to
I think you are really fit
Your fit but my gosh dont you know it

Oi just as you started to make your big advance
With the milkshake and that little dohnut in hand
I was like nah, I cant even, no you look grand
But you looked sharp there smiling hard suggesting and,
Leaning away with your hearty hearty lookin tan
But i admit the next bit was spanners to my plan
You walked toward my path but just brushed right past
And into the arms of that fucking white shirted man

Im not trying to pull you
Even tho I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit but my gosh dont you know it

What do i give a fuck I've got a girlfriend anyway
(Woah! We've all had a drink mate!)
Oi were all a bit drunk weve had a few fair play
I'v got this stella i bombed from that last cafe
This nights not even begun
Yes yes oh yay

I did fancy you a bit though, yea i must say
I would rather i hadnt mugged myself on display
But this is just another case of female stopping play
In an otherswise total result of a holiday

Im not trying to pull you
Even tho i would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit but my gosh dont you know it

You're fit but you know it!
You're fit but you know it!
I think i'm going to fall over!
I think i'm going to fall o...
