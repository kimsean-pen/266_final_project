When it gets real
Just know that I'll be there
I got your back, like it's just you and me here
I'll go to war for you, let them bring it
I'll take on the world for you, better believe it
So if you need me, just holler my name
We ain't never scared, no we're not afraid
We're never worried, but no one's here for life
I'm your ride or die

When the night gets cold
And the lights go out
The sun is gone behind the clouds
When you feel lost, then I'll reach out
To guide you home with my lighthouse
Wo-oh, wo-oh
I'll guide you home with my lighthouse
Wo-oh, wo-oh
I'll guide you home

Whenever you doubt, I'll lift you up
People gon' hate, let them hate on us
I move in too strong, I click too deep
Cause I got you, and you got me
So if you need me, just holler my name
We ain't never scared, no we're not afraid
We're never worried, but no one's here for life
I'm your ride or die

When the night gets cold
And the lights go out
The sun is gone behind the clouds
When you feel lost, then I'll reach out
To guide you home with my lighthouse
Wo-oh, wo-oh
I'll guide you home with my lighthouse
Wo-oh, wo-oh
I'll guide you home

If you ever need me
Know I'll be there
Don't you ever be afraid to call
I'll be waiting over the horizon
Don't you worry I'm not very far
I'll light it up, show you the way
I'll light it up, show you the way
I'll light it up, show you the way
I'll light it up, don't be afraid

When the night gets cold
And the lights go out
The sun is gone behind the clouds
When you feel lost, then I'll reach out
To guide you home with my lighthouse
When the night gets cold
And the lights go out
The sun is gone behind the clouds
When you feel lost, then I'll reach out
To guide you home with my lighthouse
Wo-oh, wo-oh
I'll guide you home with my lighthouse
Wo-oh, wo-oh
I'll guide you home
