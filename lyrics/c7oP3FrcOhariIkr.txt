You're walkin' like you never seen the light
you're walkin' like it every night
But I've never seen you dance
And I've never heard you sing

So how can it mean a single thing?

It is all so rudimentary
You're talkin' like your handy in the fight
You talk about it every night
But I've never seen those flowers

In the barrel of a gun

All I've ever seen you do is run
It is all so rudimentary

But tell me baby how does it feel?
I know you like the roll of the limousine wheel
And they all get them out for
(They all get them out)

For the boys in the band
(Only for the boys in the band)
They twist and they shout for
(They twist and they scream and shout)

For the boys in the band

(Only for the boys in the band)
You're walkin' like you never seen the light

You're walkin' like it every night
But then I stop to think
And I ask my self why?
One of those things that darling you must try

It is all so rudimentary
And now I'm jealous, I'm jealous of my own

I've no homestead but through these hearts I will roam, yea
They all get them out for
(They all get them out)
For the boys in the band

(Only for the boys in the band)
They scream and they shout
(They twist and they scream and shout)
For the boys in the band
(Only for the boys in the band)
But tell me baby, how does it feel?
I know you like the roll of the Limousine wheel
And they all get them out for
(And they all get them out)
For the boys in the band
(Only for the boys in the band)
They scream and they shout
(They twist and they scream and shout)
For the boys in the band
(Only for the boys in the band)
Yes they all walk them out for
(They all walk them out)
For the boys in the band
(Only for the boys in the band)
They scream and they shout
(Twist and they scream and shout)
For the boys in the band
(Only for the boys in the band)
Ahh
