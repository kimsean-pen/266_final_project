Working for vacation
Walking for meditation
Watching television for as long as I want
People got science but makes no sense,
Still can't do anything for cutting out violence
When I think of something, it goes out to space
Then it comes back (to me) in another shape
We know we are not apes,
But we could make sweet seedless grapes

Feeling wrong "cause the days are too long,
Counting heartbeats 72 in a minute
Feeling wrong "cause the days are too long,
Counting heartbeats 72 in a minute

I need to talk to an ancient Egyptian to know the transcription
To read the prescription for the friction we've got
Or the options we'll have maybe God only knows
