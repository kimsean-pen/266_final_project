I wanna get closer to where you hide
I wanna see further into your eyes
I wanna go deeper into what you deny
I wanna keep falling until there's no lie
I don't fear the dark
Show me all your scars
I wanna know who you are
(I wanna know who you are)
I don't fear the dark
Give me all your heart
I wanna know who you are

Show me the skeletons in the closet
Don't wanna play pretend, oh no
All of the skeletons, they will haunt us
Let me in, let me in
I want more

I wanna uncover what nobody knows
Where all of the secrets are taking control
All the faults are beautiful
Don't need to keep hiding
It's time to let go-o-o-oh

I don't fear the dark
Show me all your scars
I wanna know who you are

Show me the skeletons in the closet
Don't wanna play pretend, oh no
All of the skeletons, they will haunt us
Let me in, let me in
I want more

Show me the skeletons in the closet
Don't wanna play pretend, oh no
All of the skeletons, they will haunt us
Let me in, let me in
I want more

Show me all your lies
Show me where you hide

Show me the skeletons in the closet
Don't wanna play pretend, oh no
All of the skeletons, they will haunt us
Let me in, let me in
I want more

Show me the skeletons
Show me the skeletons
In the closet (in the closet)
In the closet (in the closet)
All of the skeletons
All of the skeletons
Let me in, let me in
I want more
