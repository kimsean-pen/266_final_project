I'm sure you've never had this meal before
We're still open stay and have some more
It's been raised upon your body and your soul
Total control

Plenty of seating
You know that you're eating the cannibals

Taking till you've got no more to give
Building boxes where you used to live
The word out on the street is no delay
Do it today

Come to the meeting
It's true that we're eating the cannibals
Eating the cannibals

Don't close your eyes
We'll come while you're sleeping
You reached for the skies
Now we are calling it's all falling down

Come on in we love our clientele
You're here to taste revenge and so you shall
It's been raised upon your body and your bones
But now you're not alone

Enough with the greeting
'Cause soon you'll be eating the cannibals
Eating the cannibals
