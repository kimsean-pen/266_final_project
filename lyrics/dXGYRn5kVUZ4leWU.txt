You're
So pure
So sure again

Whatever you do
We will laugh again

I'm (I'm)
Like you (Like you)
A fool again (A fool again)

Whenever I fell
I got up again (I got up again)

Babe
You don't have to be afraid
In my eyes
Babe
Don't be ashamed

Find
Your way
And lose again

Wherever you are
You can choose again

Your heart
Will break
And heal again

And one day will come
When you believe again

Babe
You don't have to be afraid
In my eyes
Babe
Don't be ashamed

Babe
You don't have to be afraid
In my eyes
Babe
I'm so glad that you've stayed

Babe
You don't have to be afraid
In my eyes
Babe
Don't be ashamed

Babe
You don't have to be afraid
In my eyes

And I'm so glad that you've stayed
