You're gonna be in my head as a friend
Or as my love at least a little until I'm dead
And when I'm that old, or just that dumb
It's gonna feel pretty real to know you were my first love

I don't care if it's the wrong way to live my life
People do this thing all the time
Let me take you to the river we can stand at the side
In the sand in the moonlight

Maybe one day, a long long time away
Then you'll know everything was real
Everything was real

You know your art is a motherfucking ticket
I want to meet someone who's like that
You watch me drink my water in half emptied out bottles
That will sit on your car floor
To be finished when we want more

You are gonna be an artist
Are gonna be an important person
You are gonna be an artist
Are gonna be an important human
You are gonna be an artist
Are gonna be an important person
You are gonna be an artist
Are gonna be an important human
You are gonna be an artist
Are gonna be an important person
You are gonna be an artist
Are gonna be an important human
