Neck, chest, waist to floor, easy to take, you could take me in fours
Make me a deal, a day a piece, take it all, just stay a week

I'll take you in pieces, we can take all apart
I've suffered shipwrecks right from the start
I've been underwater, breathing out and in
I think I'm losing where you end and I begin

Basic space, open air
Don't look away when there's nothing there

I'm setting us in stone, piece by piece, before I'm alone
Air tight, before we break, keep it in, keep us safe

It's a pool of boiling wax, I'm getting in let it set
Got to seal this in, can't adjust, can't relearn
Got to keep what I have, preserve

Basic space, open air
Don't look away when there's nothing there

Hot wax has left me with a shine wouldn't know if I'd been left behind
Second skin
Second skin

I can't let it out, I still let you in
I can't let it out, I still let you in
