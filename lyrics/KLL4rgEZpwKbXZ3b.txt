I miss you most on winter mornings
As we drift we slip through evenings, whoa-oh
We drive into the cold and dark with fingers crossed
I follow your lies to avoid from getting lost

And all I had was the memory of what was
So let's pretend it never mattered to us
I hope this message finds you well
I never thought I'd live to tell

Just to survive we do what we can
We read the maps and signs, and we make the plans
By our design I write it down to get me by
The worst time in my life

And all I had was the memory of what was
So lets pretend it never mattered to us
I hope this message finds you well
I never thought I'd live to tell
What's a dream and what is real, the way I really feel

I hope this message finds you well
I never thought I'd live to tell
What's a dream and what is real
(So let's pretend this is the ending
To the message I've been sending sadly...)

And all I had was the memory of what was
So lets pretend it never mattered to us
I hope this message finds you well
I never thought I'd live to tell
What's a dream and what is real, the way I really feel

I hope this message finds you well
I never thought I'd live to tell
What's a dream and what is real, the way I really feel
