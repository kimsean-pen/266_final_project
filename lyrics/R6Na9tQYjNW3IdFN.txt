We never fought for freedom
For nasty little brutes like you
To come undo the work we do
You bring shame on this country for true
Embarrassed by you

We never fought for freedom
For nasty little brutes like you
To come undo the work we do
You bring shame on this country for true
Embarrassed by you

You make your livin'
By robbing from others
Pull up your hoodies
Are you undercover?
A street full of looters
Playing it evil
Riding your scooters
Like Evil Knievel

We never fought for freedom
For nasty little brutes like you
To come undo the work we do
You bring shame on this country for true
Embarrassed by you

We never fought for freedom
For nasty little brutes like you
To come undo the work we do
You bring shame on this country for true
Embarrassed by you
Embarrassed by you

You have no morals
No sense of reason
You have no future
You have no freedom
Jabbin' and a stabbin'
And walkin' the line
Shame on the footprints
You're livin' behind

We never fought for freedom
For nasty little brutes like you
To come undo the work we do
You bring shame on this country for true
Embarrassed by you
Embarrassed by you
