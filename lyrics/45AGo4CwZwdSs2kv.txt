Do you wanna go on a road trip?
If you drive I'll bring the trail mix
Make our way down to Texas
And eat tacos every day for breakfast

Will you come with me?
Across the country

We can go to every gas station
Buy postcards for all our friends
Make our way to the ocean
Forget about our everyday obligations

Will you come with me?
Across the country

Don't know which way to go
Don't know where to call home
Don't know which way to go
Don't know where to call home

(I lost the map)
Don't know which way to go
(No going back)
Don't know where to call home
Don't know where to call home
Don't know where to call home
Don't know where to call home
Don't know where to call home
Don't know where to call home

Don't know which way to go
Don't know where to call home
