Well-paid Jesus, vicious nails by tired angels of mine
Fresh taste of first light when they do come down
Skin-deep memories of siren lullabies

Sealed from us from me from everything you go
Despair you tend to bring to me, to us, to everything with tide comes

Holy water, she's breaking those waves
Holy water, she's breathing those waves
The silence keeps her sane

Tainted sounds from haunted throats
Iron tears on satin sheets
Silver spoon and bread through pain
And the silent others kneels(?)

Ether eyes have never seen
Where dirty hands have never been

Sealed from us from me from everything you go
Despair you tend to bring to me, to us, to everything with tide comes

Holy water, she's breaking those waves
Holy water, she's breathing those waves
The silence keeps her sane
