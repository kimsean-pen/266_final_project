I don't wanna be the one to tell you the world is broke
But you're so innocent you cannot separate fire from the smoke
Words drip like honey dear how sweet it is to hear
But not everything that you are presented is as it appears
So he tells you love you now?
Driving you crazy how
Fingers on lips, allow his hands to your hips
You know you shouldn't do this

Oh, you think he's looking lovingly at you
But it's nowhere near the truth
His mind is up to no good
Oh, just because you're in the same bed
He's with someone else in his head, not a second thought about you
Oh

Don't get too comfortable with the man who has no history
Shadows climbing walls hide cracks we don't want other eyes to see
You tell me to shut my mouth, you love the mystery
So he tells you love you now?
Driving you crazy how
Fingers on lips, allow his hands on your hips
You know you shouldn't do this
There's no turning back

You think he's looking lovingly at you
But it's nowhere near the truth
His mind is up to no good
Oh, just because you're in the same bed
He's with someone else in his head, not a second thought about you

Oh, you think he's looking lovingly at you
But it's nowhere near the truth
His mind is up to no good
Oh, just because you're in the same bed
He's with someone else in his head, not a second thought about you

Oh, there's no turning back
Oh, there's no turning back
Oh, no no no no
Oh, no no no no
