A surge of crows, a foreshadow
a loom of the one who is grand and potent
a burst of unholy fire, harbinger of his arrival
Fiery eyes of a black wolf
fair and righteous like no other
far from neglect and defiance, he will lead us

We'll march onward to a far distant shore
where our bright will grow - we will follow him!
He's right by our side - with him we will ride
the gates open wide - we will honour him!

He's the one we shall follow tonight
walking endlessly on the path of the dreamer
he will come and we'll follow the signs in a pagan absolution time
He's the one we shall follow away
furthermost from wrong from their narrow demeanours
he will come and we'll follow the signs in a pagan absolution night

A cloak of lustre his garment
suited for the prince of darkness
conjuring magickal pyre - summoning wildfire
He'll wipe out the fools and the improper
the ones who plague our dear earth
with their ignorance and self denial - he will lead us

We'll march onward to a far distant shore
where our bright will grow - we will follow him!
He's right by our side - with him we will ride
the gates open wide - we will honour him!

He's the one we shall follow tonight
walking endlessly on the path of the dreamer
he will come and we'll follow the signs in a pagan absolution time
He's the one we shall follow away
furthermost from wrong from their narrow demeanours
he will come and we'll follow the signs in a pagan absolution night

He's the one we shall follow tonight
walking endlessly on the path of the dreamer
he will come and we'll follow the signs in a pagan absolution time
He's the one we shall follow away
furthermost from wrong from their narrow demeanours
he will come and we'll follow the signs in a pagan absolution night
He's the one we shall follow tonight
walking endlessly on the path of the dreamer
he will come and we'll follow the signs in a pagan absolution time
