I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
They weren't kidding when they called me
Well, a witch?

But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways
Repented, seen the light
And made a switch

And I fortunately know a little magic
It's a talent that I always have possessed
And here lately, please don't laugh
I use it on behalf
Of the miserable, lonely, and depressed

Poor unfortunate souls
In pain, in need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them?
Yes, indeed

Poor unfortunate souls
So sad, so true
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying: "Spells, Ursula, please!"
And I help them
Yes, I do

Now it's happened once or twice
Someone couldn't pay the price
And I'm afraid
I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals

Yes I've had the odd complaint
But on the whole I've been a saint
To those poor unfortunate souls

Poor unfortunate souls
In pain, in need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them?
Yes, indeed

Poor unfortunate souls
So sad, so true
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying: "Spells, Ursula, please!"
And I help them
Yes, I do

The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore
Yes, on land it's much preferred
For ladies not to say a word
And after all dear, what is idle prattle for?

They're not all that impressed with conversation
True gentlemen avoid it when they can
But they dote and swoon and fawn
On a lady who's withdrawn
It's she who holds her tongue
Come on, girl!

Poor unfortunate soul
Go ahead!
Make your choice
I'm a very busy woman
And I haven't got all day
It won't cost much
Just your voice!

Poor unfortunate soul
It's sad, but true
If you want to cross the bridge
You've got to pay the toll
Take a gulp and take a breath
And go ahead
Come on, girl!

Poor unfortunate souls
In pain, in need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them?
Yes, indeed
Come on, girl!

Poor unfortunate souls
In pain, in need
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying: "Spells, Ursula, please!"
And I help them
Yes I do
