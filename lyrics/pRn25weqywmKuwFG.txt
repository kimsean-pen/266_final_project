I don't know why
I don't know reason to fight
It's just for joy

I don't know why
I don't know reason to die
It's just for show

想像していたような Everything is imitation
Die inside, おどけて笑う
They don't know what you want
The sacrifice is never knowing
Dawn Dawn
What should I do?

DING‐DONG
I hear sound of the bell
ABRACADABRA
I said words

簡単に全部リセットできたら
こうやって泣いちゃいないよ

GIVE ME and I know
GIVE ME and you know
理想とか期待では
明日は変わらない
GIVE ME and I know
GIVE ME and you know
少しでも描いたら
その希望を
離さないで
ほら

I don't know why
I don't know reason to try
It's just for fame

I don't know why
I don't know reason to hide
It's just for fun

想像していたような Everything is imitation
Die inside, おどけて笑う
They don't know what you want
The sacrifice is never knowing
Dawn Dawn
What should I do?

GIVE ME and I know
GIVE ME and you know
理想とか期待では
明日は変わらない
GIVE ME and I know
GIVE ME and you know
痛いくらい悩んでも
離さないで

いつだって考えて
足を止めてさまよった
曖昧なこの心情は息を止めた

GIVE ME and I know
GIVE ME and you know
理想とか期待では
明日は変わらない
GIVE ME and I know
GIVE ME and you know
"居たい"願いを繋いだら
その希望を
離さないで
