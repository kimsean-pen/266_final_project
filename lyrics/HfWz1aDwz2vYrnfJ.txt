Can you feel that?
Oh shit

Ooh ah ah ah ah

Ooh ah ah ah ah
Drowning deep in my sea of loathing
Broken your servant I kneel
(Will you give it to me?)
It seems what's left of my human side
Is slowly changing in me

(Will you give it to me?)
Looking at my own reflection
When suddenly it changes
Violently it changes
Oh no, there is no turning back now

You've woken up the demon in me
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
Open up your hate, and let it flow into me
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
You mother get up
Come on get down with the sickness

You fucker get up
Come on get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift, that has been given to me
I can see inside you, the sickness is rising
Don't try to deny what you feel
(Will you give it to me?)

It seems that all that was good has died
And is decaying in me
(Will you give it to me?)
It seems you're having some trouble
In dealing with these changes

Living with these changes
Oh no, the world is a scary place
Now that you've woken up the demon in me
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
Open up your hate, and let it flow into me
Get up, come on get down with the sickness

You mother get up
Come on get down with the sickness
You fucker get up
Come on get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift, that has been given to me
And when I dream
And when I dream
And when I dream
And when I dream
No mommy, don't do it again
Don't do it again
I'll be a good boy
I'll be a good boy, I promise
No mommy don't hit me, oh-ooh
Why did you have to hit me like that mommy?
Don't do it! You're hurting me, oh-ooh
Why did you have to be such a bitch?
Why don't you, why don't you fuck off and die?
Why can't you just fuck off and die?
Why can't you just leave here and die?
Never stick your hand in my face again bitch
Fuck you

I don't need this shit
You stupid sadistic abusive fucking whore
How would you like to see how it feels mommy?
Here it comes, get ready to die
Ooh ah ah ah ah
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
Open up your hate, and let it flow into me
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
You mother get up
Come on get down with the sickness
You fucker get up
Come on get down with the sickness
Madness has now come over me
