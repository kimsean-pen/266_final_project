Ah-ah
Ah-ah
(Man) Ah-ah

Off in my head, lost, off in my head
Off in my head, lost, off in my head
Off in my head, lost, off in my head
Off in my head, lost, off in my head

Lost all my arms, lost-lost all my legs
Lost is my heart, but my new soul stays, we're singing

Off in my head, lost, off in my head
Off in my head, lost
Do we really know the way the wind blows?

(Wind blows)
Are we really safe around our shadows?
(Shadows)
Do we really know the way the wind blows?
(Wind blows)

Are we really safe around our shadows?
(Shadows)
Through our windows
Okay
Off in the red, dance-dance with the dead

Off in the red, dance-dance with the dead
Off in the red, dance-dance with the dead

Off in the red, dance-dance with the dead
Lost all my arms, lost-lost all my legs
Lost is my heart, but my new soul stays, we're singing

Off in my head, lost, off in my head
Off in my head, lost
Do we really know the way the wind blows?
(Wind blows)
Are we really safe around our shadows?
(Shadows)

Do we really know the way the wind blows?
(Wind blows)
Are we really safe around our shadows?
(Shadows)

Through our windows
Yeah
Aw man, I can't believe this is happening (Ah-ah)
Aw man, I can't believe this is happening (Ah-ah)
Aw man, I can't believe this is happening (Ah-ah)

Aw man, I can't believe...

Do we really know the way the wind blows?
(Wind blows)
Are we really safe around our shadows?
(Shadows)
Do we really know the way the wind blows?
(Wind blows)
Are we really safe around our shadows?
(Shadows)
Through our windows
But I'm aware
And I don't care
And I'm aware, yeah
But I'm aware
And I don't care
And I'm aware, yeah, yeah
