You move into my line of fire
Move into my line of fire
I need to know
I need to see you
Move into my line of fire

I'm gonna break you
I'm gonna make you pay
I'm gonna break you
I'm gonna make your beauty
On my skin like oxyacetylene
Steel yourself for me

The weathers cold the news is grim
I'm under pressure
I won't give in
There's blood on the windows
And ice on the sheets
You better steel yourself give in

I'm gonna break you
I'm gonna make you pay
I'm gonna break you
I'm gonna make your beauty
On my skin like oxyacetylene
Steel yourself for me

Your little hands reaching high
Your little hands reach for the sky

I'm gonna break you
I'm gonna make you pay
I'm gonna break you
I'm gonna make your beauty
On my skin like oxyacetylene
Give in
