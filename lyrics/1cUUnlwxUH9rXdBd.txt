Eye ya ya ya ya
I'm stuffes
Eye ya ya ya ya
Nice pup
Eye ya! Eye ya!
Eye ya! Eye ya!
Aye ya ya ya
I'll never reply yuh

Wore out my wheels, while I wore down my weight
Pour out the squeal, hear the seal 'bout to break
Wore out my wheels, while I wore down my weight
Pour out the squeal, hear the seal 'bout to break

Retired is a word that I hate
I go quiet 'cause I know how to think
Skunk pliers are the tools of the dank
Young friar is my new chicken drank

Why you go and try and touch people
Eight hundred sixty seven bald eagles
Why you go and try and touch people
Eight hundred sixty seven red beetles

Where do you want to be?
Have you settled for the comfort of security?

Half-baked
What a waste
Out of shape but not overweight
If you showed restraint you could seperate

Asses, asses, asses in battle
Die die die die die ya bad apples
Asses, asses, asses in battle
Use your face like a dumb ass rattle
My accent, my glibness
A bee dipped in brass
I'm stuck on the isthmus connecting my past
A passionate servant when I'm paid in cash
Don't ask if it's worth it, don't think about the math
There's no complaining in the mansion
You can't do just what I do
I chuck my brain through the black
Climb up the tree
Shoot out the cannon
Fuck her cause she reads

Punctuation violation perpetrator is verified
Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi!

Wanted you to know
Came close to being another echo
Don't have a soul
But I'm on a roll

Comfort in the words of a swindler
Everybody needs approval
One love in the halls of a savior

Act like you're above them
All the lives you're running
Will you ever feel it again?
Like you're part of something

Worth fighting for
Worth dying for

Flunked out and flung from the front of your face wait
I smell Sharon's pimple
It's the size of grapes
I'm so splintered that my mind wave baked
I had cash but I sold it for some soul
I'm da wraith
