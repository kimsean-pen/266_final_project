Everybody needs lovin' sometimes
Physical emotion alright baby
To see your face light up
Would give me nothin' but bliss
And when I start showin' off
I'd never know how to quit
Say something I'm not givin' up on you
I'll stay as long as I need to
I wanna be all you think about
Anything and everything you dream about
As if I had it all figured out
I wanna be the one you can't breathe without
It might be hard to play it cool
Cause I know that's not what gentlemen do, yeah yeah
When Im hurtin' just to know you're fighting
Listen to me reminiscin' and let love guide you, woah
Say something I've got a lot to lose
Odds say that you're not gonna pull through
I wanna be all you think about
Anything and everything you dream about
As if I had it all figured out
I wanna be the one you can't breathe without
If you could open your eyes
I don't know where you are
In your mind but listen to your soul
Trying to find its way back to your heart
From the car to the ER
Just think of me and pull yourself back to creation
I wanna be all you think about
Anything and everything you dream about
As if I had it all figured out
I wanna be the one you can't breathe without
If you could open your eyes
