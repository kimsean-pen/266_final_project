how can I laugh at a time like this?
I guess my sense of humor's sick
I inhaled a red balloon
soon I'll be over the moon

with every step that I take
I wanna take it all back
back home is too far away
the devil's calling my cab
don't wanna cause any pain
I'm only making it worse
I gotta get out
and make this better

tell my mother that I miss her
tell my father that I tried
don't confuse my little sister
let her sleep on it tonight
with the sticks and stones I'm made of
I swear I tried the best I could
I still wanna be a winner
I want to be GOOD

I want to be GOOD

how did I, how did I end up here?
hands on the wheel with a gripping fear
stomach churns, but I have faith
I'm driving to a better place

with every step that I take
I wanna take it all back
back home is too far away
the devil's calling my cab
don't wanna cause any pain
I'm only making it worse
I gotta get out
and make this better

tell my mother that I miss her
tell my father that I tried
don't confuse my little sister
let her sleep on it tonight
with the sticks and stones I'm made of
I swear I tried the best I could
I still wanna be a winner
I want to be GOOD (good!)

I want to be GOOD (good!)
I want to be GOOD (good!)
I want to be GOOD (good!)
