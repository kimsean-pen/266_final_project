Last night in a city near the persian gulf
The heat soared to 163
The heat soared to 163

It's already considered to be
One of the hottest places on earth
But this was a heat that could burn up the sea
This was a heat that could burn up the sea

Tom says it's gonna burn them all
Burn them all
Burn them all
Before they burn each other (Before they burn each other)

Meanwhile Mohammad remains
Force-fed by his god damn brother
Force-fed by his god damn brother
God damn brother

Shawkan like Mohammad
Held without indictment
Like Victor Jara he was taken to the stadium
Now he's in a cell
One meter of hell
Now he's in a cell
One meter of hell (One meter of hell)

The patchwork is made of pain
A history of gain
Can I help you with your fiction?
Can I help you with your fiction?
A history of gain
A history of gain
A history of gain through fiction
A history of gain through friction

Now Badawi is in the middle of a circle of men
Lashes from a whip like the marks of a pen
The mark of a pen like the mind of a boy
Whose father defines what he uses as toys

A history of gain
A history of gain
A history of gain through fiction
A history of gain through friction

Protect yourself from the back of your mind
Potemkin self in the back of your mind
Protect yourself from the back of your mind
Potemkin self in the back of your mind
