[Jim:] "This is K.A.O.S.
You and I are listening to KAOS in Los Angeles.
Let's go to the telephones now and take a request."
[Billy:] "Hello, I'm Billy."
[Jim:] "Yes?"
[Billy:] "I hear radio waves in my head."
[Jim:] "You hear radio waves in your head?
Ah! Is there a request that you have tonight for KAOS?"

Radio waves
Radio waves
He hears radio waves
Radio waves

The atmosphere is thin and cold
The yellow sun is getting old
The ozone overflows with radio waves

AM, FM, weather and news
Our leaders had a frank exchange of views
Are you confused, radio waves

Radio waves
Radio waves
AM radio waves
FM radio waves

Radio waves
Mind-numbing radio waves
Fish-stunning radio waves
Radio waves

Magic Billy in his wheel chair
Is picking up all this stuff in the air
Billy is face to face with outer space

Messages from distant stars
The local police calling all cars
Radio waves

Hear them radio waves
Radio waves
Jesus saves radio
Radio waves

Radio waves
AM radio waves
FM radio waves
All them radio waves

[Jim:] "Alright, that's a song called Radio Waves.
You are listening to KAOS
In Los Angeles and we've got Billy on the line."
[Billy:] "I'm from the valleys."
