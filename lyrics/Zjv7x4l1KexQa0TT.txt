Blind, I was blind it to all
I'd write songs to complicated piano & guitar chords
Singing about kissin at midnight on a rooftop
Saying you'll escort me to ya bedroom right?
We'll be watching movies all night
You know how to grind that shit right and roll that shit tight
Late night no make up on silk scarf on my head
You look into my eyes
"Yea I prefer this you instead"

You make me feel like a natural woman
You make me feel like I have some emotion
Like I have enough love to share with someone
You make me feel like a natural woman

You're pretty much my controller
Let me see you robot, haven't seen you in a minute
Yeah na
I don't like that stuff
Didn't know that I was keen on jazz
could rappity rap or street tappity tap
Quit when I was 11 to work on my tennis
Now all I do is run from love
And now I guess I'm Galileo coz all I do is reach for the stars
And Mars
And Venus
Serena

We'll be watching movies all night
You know how to grind that shit right and roll that shit tight
Late night no make up on silk scarf on my head
You look into my eyes
"Yea I prefer this you instead"

You make me feel like a natural woman
You make me feel like I have some emotion
Like I have enough love to share with someone
You make me feel like a natural woman

We're drivin on that 480 reactions slow but crazy
Smokin on the purple Hazey
Picked me up at a friends house
40 minute drive
Stopped at McDonald's
Got a happy meal, extra pickle, despicable me toy inside
It's my first time
I've never kissed a guy,
like I've held a hand and maybe kissed a cheek a couple times but
None of that lip lip tongue shit yet
Never done none of that lip lip tongue shit

You reach into my mind talking bout the universe
And how it ain't fair and that I suit won't blue hair
Your mum and daddy don't care
You get all the girls attention and you blush when I say
"Mmm Yea I know..."

And the white girls want your baby
And the white girls want yo baby
Been on some BS lately
When's the last time you hooked your boy with a fresh fade
Have you seen his face lately?
You told me how his woman took your place
But you forgot all about that and asked me how was my day?
Yea I like that
And this is exactly how you make me feel

You make me feel like a natural woman
You make me feel like I have some emotion
Like I have enough love to share with someone
You make me feel like a natural woman
