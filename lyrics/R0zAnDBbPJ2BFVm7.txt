State your case, fire at will
And I got sick all day
I can't stay too far away
These cities are passing

Face to numbers
I got attached too much
I'm out in the cold rain
You can see the pain

Tell me you're not the lesson
That I've learned
What are your thoughts on loose ends?
Please I'm not

In a fit of rage
I will select the pain
In a fit of rage
Always about to break
In a fit of rage
I was about to break
Into a fit of rage
You can't deny
I was so close to you

I'm saying it won't stop
I'll never let it go
I'm saying it won't stop
I'm never letting go

Face to numbers
I got attached too much
The other ones
That had slipped away
Had to cut their tongues
I couldn't let 'em say

Tell me you're not the lesson
That I've learned
Weighing your thoughts on loose ends
Please I'm not

In a fit of rage
I will select the pain
In a fit of rage
Always about to break
In a fit of rage
I was about to break
Into a fit of rage
You can't deny
I was so close to you

I'm saying it won't stop
I'll never let it go
I'm saying it won't stop
I'm never letting go

I'm saying it won't stop
I'll never let it go
I'm saying it won't stop
I'm never letting go

In a fit of rage
I will select the pain
In a fit of rage
Always about to break
In a fit of rage
I was about to break
Into a fit of rage
You can't deny
