The poor stays poor
The rich get richer
It's just so disproportionate...
(Get outta here!)

Sometimes life seems so unfortunate
That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer
It's just so disproportionate
You don't know just what I've gone through
That's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it

Every rule, I'm breakin' it

Tear-able, but not rip-able, invincible, I hung invisible
Fuckin' mistletoe all over the world, I stuck my ass up under it
Now pucker up them lips and kiss it ho
Here we go, Bad and Evil so you know how this'll go
The competition's miserable, we stomp them bitches this is no, joke
Goin' overboard like someone threw us off the boat, choke
Cough from all the smoke, I'm tryna stay on fire
So you know if I hate fucking water sprinklers, I don't love the hose
Someone let the cat out the bag, now it's time to stuff his face
Back in that bitch, smother that little motherfucker 'til it suffocates
You had long enough of a wait
Why are they tryin' to be so secretive when Bad and Evil has reunited, hey?
Came back to annihilate to the game's in dire straights as I await
World is Satan as I drop fall to my knees before this Ouija board
And I pray now I lay me down to sleep
I do this shit in my sleep, I'm sleepin' now, imagine if I awake
I'm champ bitch, I'll never taste the canvas
Could never be no damn wuss or pussy, never mushy, so you can't squish
Nowhere near a toosh, in fact if I jump out a bush
In a sneak attack's the only way I say I am-Bush
Outlandish, these words are weapons that are brandish, standoffish
To hoes, keep your hands off this

Can't top it, so what the fuck would I sugarcoat it for?
Law? Fuck protocol, holla at this ho, but now my throat is sore

Sometimes life seems so unfortunate
That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer
It's just so disproportionate
You don't know just what I've gone through

That's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it
Every rule, I'm breakin' it

Baby I'm lawless, you couldn't burn me if you threw acid on me
I met your homie, I'm at your home ready to spray you while you nappin' homie
Have everything on and around your mattress lookin' like the word in front of a matrimony
You high, thug yeah go 'head jump, no matter how high you get
You gon' come up short like Spud Webb
My DUI's get waved by saying bye
Still ridin' with no L's like James Todd
Can't change I thank God for my safe thinking
Last time I was safe thinking, me and my niggas was doin' a bank job
I stay violent, y'all go to the peace route
You got a mouth like Kanye, I'll knock your whole bottom row of teeth out
No disrespect to Mr. West, shit I'm just nice with mine
And this just wrap 'em, I'm like Ricky Hatton, I just like the line
These weak rappers wanna set us up, they never tough
They ask me for a hook, I tell 'em left to right, head or gut
What y'all messin' with is a nigga that'll leave you FUBAR
Fucked up beyond all recognition
Y'all are rock stars, I'm the opposite
I could just throw a rock and hit a star for the fuck of it

Partner, you're not hard, I body your hot bars
Beef is left you pray, right like Allahu Akbar
Let's go, when I leave y'all shot, you ain't gon' be on your Metro
In a bad area that call dropped
Sometimes life seems so unfortunate
That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer
It's just so disproportionate
You don't know just what I've gone through
That's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it
Every rule, I'm breakin' it
