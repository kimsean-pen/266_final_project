I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
(Collar me, don't collar me)
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
(We are agents of the free)
I've had my fun and now it's time to serve (Over me, not over me)
Your conscience overseas
Comin' in fast, over me (oh, oh)

(Follow me, don't follow me)
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
(Collar me, don't collar me)
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
(We are agents of the free)
I've had my fun and now it's time to serve(Over me, not over me)
Your conscience overseas
Coming in fast, over me (oh, oh)

High on the roof, thin the blood
Another one came on the waves tonight
Comin' in, you're home

We would circle and we'd circle and we'd circle to stop and consider
and centered on the pavement stacked up all the trucks jacked up and
our wheels in slush and orange crush in pocket and all this here
county, hell, any county, it's just like heaven here,
and I was remembering and I was just in a different county and all
then this whirlybird that I headed for I had my goggles pulled
off; I knew it all, I knew every back road and every truck stop

(Follow me, don't follow me)
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
(Collar me, don't collar me)
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
(We are agents of the free)
I've had my fun and now it's time to serve (Over me, not over me)
Your conscience overseas
Coming in fast, over me (oh, oh)

High on the roof, thin the blood
Another one climbs on the waves tonight
Comin' in, you're home

High on the roof, thin the blood
Another one climbs on the waves tonight
Comin' in, you're home

(Ah, oh)
