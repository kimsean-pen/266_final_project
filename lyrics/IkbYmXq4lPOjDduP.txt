I know this love is kinda crazy
But baby it's much more than lust
Without you by my side, I'm dazy
All I can think about is us
The streets I wander just to picture
Moments and dreams I shared with you
Although new flowers will be blooming
Without you by my side, I'm blue

Oh how I want you
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel

Stay
