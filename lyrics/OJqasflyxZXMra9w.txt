Cannot swallow the soil, make it all beautiful
Cannot carry you, carry you, carry you now
The truth can't bare the sunlight
You're afraid for the day it does
And when I told you so
I got burned, burned, burned again

Heaven forbid that my heart is for sale
Hope in the end, truth prevails

I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world
Feel that I'm gonna get home if I try
I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world
Need to find my way home, home

You're as proud as a god, but I believed in your heart
And I'll be leaving you, leaving you, leaving you now
The truth can't bare the sunlight
And don't pretend to be my guide
You said you'd change it all
But I got burned, burned, burned instead

Heaven can wait 'cause my soul ain't for sale
Hope in the end, truth prevails

I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world
Feel that I'm gonna get home if I try
I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world
Need to find my way home, home, home

I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world
Feel that I'm gonna get home if I try
I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world
Need to find my way home, home

Justify, no more lies
Once upon a time
