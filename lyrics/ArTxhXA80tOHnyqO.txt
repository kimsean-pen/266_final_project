oh
when i got you by my side
everythings alright
its just when your gone, i start to snooze the alarm
and i stay up until 4 in the morning
countin all the days till your back
shiverin in an ice cold bath
of emotions and math
oh its a shame and im to blame
cuz we're alright
until you go and i start losin control without one in
countin all the days till your back
shiverin in an ice cold bath
of emotions and math
Ive gotta get outta this tree, off of this limb
im a woman actin like a kid
a skinny mess thats breathless from tellin you all the things that im gonna do
i was a rolling stone
out on my own
but now that youre here, im just livin in fear
of you leavin
countin all the days till your back
shiverin in an ice cold bath
of emotions and math
ive gotta get outta this tree
off of this limb
im a women actin like a kid
a skinny mess thats breathless
from tellin you all the things, im gonna do

THE END
