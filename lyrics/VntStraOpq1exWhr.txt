How can I just break it off to leave for good and never talk?
I'm about to write it up for you to mock
And clear my mind for the thousandth time

I've been too involved to call it off
Been away for so long all I've got are
weak foundations, wishful thoughts
And all around a greater view

How do you think that that's okay?
To still like all the things I play?
To still try not to walk my way?
I taught you all those things to say

And its nothing like it used to be
There's no more of what I used to see
But you help me with my honesty
While I'm yelling at your ghost

Make things worse
I always seem to make things worse
Cause I can't seem to shake this curse
I can't seem to put you first

And I spend all my time
With you in my hindsight
Got so many questions that i'll ask when the times right

How can I just break it off and leave for good and never talk?
How can I just break it off and leave for good and never talk?

How do you think that that's okay?
To still like all the things I play?
To still try not to walk my way?
I taught you all those things to say
And its nothing like it used to be
There's no more of what I used to see
But you help me with my honesty
While I'm yelling at your ghost

And when you finally see the scope
Feel the ghost grip of my choke
I won't know you ill love you less and it'll be effortless

How do you think that that's okay?
To still like all the things I play?
To still try not to walk my way?
I taught you all those things to say
And its nothing like it used to be
There's no more of what I used to see
But you help me with my honesty
While I'm yelling at your ghost
