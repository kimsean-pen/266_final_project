Someone gotta go
Aah ah ah
Someone gotta go

Do you know how it feels
When you're standin' on the outside?
Everyday, on this, standin' on the outside
And I wanna come in
Lord I'm standin' on the outside
Do you know how it feels
When you're standin' on the outside?

(How do you sleep at night)
When you've stolen everything you have
I got to know how do you sleep at night
(How do you sleep at night)
Stolen everything that you have

Do you know how it feels
When you're standin' on the outside?
All my life, I been standin' on the outside
Get me comb without honey
When you're standin' on the outside?
Giving up feeling, when I'm standin' on the outside

But how do you sleep at night
(How do you sleep at nigh)
When you've stolen everything you have
Tell me how do you sleep at night
(How do you sleep at nigh)
When you know, when you know, when you know

Oh I gotta know
(How do you sleep at night)
How do you sleep at night
When you've stolen everything you have?
(How do you sleep at night)
How do you sleep at night
When you've stolen from me?

Do you know how it feels to be standin' on the outside?
