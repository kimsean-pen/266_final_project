Electrify my body
And you're makin' me feel
Like I'm so electric
Everything you do is makin' me
Blow Blow Blow

Don't know what to do about it
Can't seem how to live without it
All I wanna do is just
Know Know Know

You suffocate my mind
And now my atmosphere is crowded
And you being here is makin' me
Blow Blow Blow

You penetrate my space
And now I'm looking out of place
And you're makin' it hard for me
I need air!

I
Breathe
Air!
I
Breathe
Air!
I
Breathe
Air!
I
Breathe
Air!

Kaleidoscope of colours that you bring to me
You're freaking out my energy
I'm losin' and you're makin' me
Low Low Low

Don't know what to do about it
You and I can't live without it
All I wanna do is just
Go Go Go

You smother my emotions
Now I'm drowning in your ocean
And I'm runnin' and I'm feelin' like
I don't care

Penetrate my space
And now you're looking out of place
cuz youre makin' this hard for me
I need air!

I
Breathe
Air!
I
Breathe
Air!
I
Breathe
Air!
I
Breathe
Air!

Makin' my body so erratic!
...Just makin' my body so erratic!

Give me air!
I need air!

You penetrate my space
And now I'm looking out of place
And you're makin' it hard for me
I need air!

I
Breathe
Air!
I
Breathe
Air!
I
Breathe
Air!
I
Breathe
Air!
