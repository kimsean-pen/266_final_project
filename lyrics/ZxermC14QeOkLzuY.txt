We gather medicine for heartache
So we can act a fool
It's incomplete without you
The silver soul is running through
It's a vision
Complete illusion, yeah

The needle on the spinning wheel
Collecting silver coil
It gathers heat without you
Whether or not you're turned from it
It's a quick turn
To let us in, yeah

It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
Ah, it is happening again

The bodies lying in the sand
They're moving in the dark
It is so quick to let us in
Feel it moving through our skin
It's a sickness
Infinite quickness, yeah

It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
Ah, it is happening again
It is happening again
Ah, it is happening again
It is happening again
Ah, it is happening again
It is happening again
Ah, it is happening again
It is happening again
