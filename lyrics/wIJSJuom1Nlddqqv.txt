We packin' diamond pistols!

I done blew up and copped the crib I don't gotta pay the rent now
(I don't gotta pay the rent)
Before the money that girl lookin' like a ten but she a letdown
(More like a ten minus four)
Yuh, I'm talkin' platinum, fuck around and blow up like a loaded gun
Before the money that girl lookin' like a ten but she a letdown

Imagine all the bands I could blow
Tryna get rich think of the hands I could throw (throw)
And all the screamin' fans at the show (show)
Singin' every word, goddamn that'd be dope (dope)
Yuh, if I had a hit (a hit), I'm picturing
If I blew up on the chart's that'd be it (that'd be it)
Think of the money (money)
That shit'll mint
I'll cop the new Mercedez Benz

Made a milli and I got some teeth
Shoutout Obie Trice smilin' like Mr Clean
Black Jag boy I stay with queens
I'm only hittin' H now, I'm too rich for weed
My numbers stay the same, I'm not callin' back
They say "I done changed" Nothin' wrong with that
Now these little leprechauns want my sack
I'm countin' racks, eatin' wings in the Maybach

I done blew up and copped the crib I don't gotta pay the rent now
(I don't gotta pay the rent)
Before the money that girl lookin' like a ten but she a letdown
(More like a ten minus four)
Yuh, I'm talkin' platinum, fuck around and blow up like a loaded gun
Before the money that girl lookin' like a ten but she a letdown
