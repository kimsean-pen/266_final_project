No matter what you do there's something everyone shows
We all inherit ourselves from a pair
And if you never met them or you call them your friends
One thing is certain, the tree never ends
And though it's been a while since I first saw them
I still say
Hey mom
How are you today?
Are you missing me?
A lot?
Yes I'm sticking to my bedtime
And I'm keeping very warm
So hey dad
Don't you worry now
Cause I got it all worked out
But don't tell me
"did you keep my room?"
Cause I'm going oversea
I sure don't know what's making me
What's part of the plan
But that's what happened
And I'm going back
But now I'm here
I better go find something to do
Something I want to
So they can relax

Hey mom
How are you today?
Are you missing me?
A lot?
Yes I'm sticking to my bedtime
And I'm keeping very warm
So hey dad
Don't you worry now
Cause I got it all worked out
But don't tell me
"did you keep my room?"
Cause I'm going oversea
Well I found my life has happened all before
Sometimes I realize
Time's running out and I don't know what to
"Japanese verse"
Hey mom

And I'm keeping very warm
So hey dad
Don't you worry now
Cause I got it all worked out
But don't tell me
"did you keep my room?"
Cause I'm going oversea 3x
