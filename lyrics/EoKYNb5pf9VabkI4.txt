One, two, three, four
It's an awful way to feel,
You feel so low like you can't go on
But don't you fear my dear,
You're the only thing that keeps me feeling
Anything at all
Close your eyes and ease your troubled mind
Ahhhh ahh ah ahhhh
Sometimes in the middle of the night
I wake up and roll out of bed
And wonder why I even woke up in the first place
It's so awful
Then to make the matters even worse
I swear my love I have a curse
I can't do anything quite right
I swear I'm trying
It's so awful
I'm awfully awful
Today

It's a complex sort of thing
The type of thing that I don't like to
Sing with all my heart
Emotions fade the nightmares start
And I can't waste my time
I close my eyes and ease my troubled mind
Ahhhh ahh ah ahhhh
Sometimes in the middle of the night

I wake up and roll out of bed
And wonder why I even woke up in the first place
It's so awful
Then to make the matters even worse
I swear my love I have a curse
I can't do anything quite right
I swear I'm trying
It's so awful
I'm awfully awfully awful
Today

I'm waking up for the first time
Since I lost track of my ways
I took my last pill last night
I'm waking up for the first time
The last time
Ahhh ahhhh ahhhh ahhhh

Sometimes in the middle of the night
I wake up and roll out of bed
And wonder why I even woke up in the first place
It's so awful
Then to make the matters even worse
I swear my love I have a curse
I can't do anything quite right
I swear I'm trying
It's so awful
I'm awfully awfully awfully awful
Today
