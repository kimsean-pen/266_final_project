You got my heart straight pulling in the wrong direction
You got me all along with my own affections
Sooner I pull away, the sooner I'm safe
As I try to forget you

You got me needing you like you're some religion
You told me go away like it's my decision
But as soon as I pull away,
Before I'm back into my arms
So I'll never forget you

By alone, I won't go, for you
I'm always just following the best suggestion
By alone, will go

Why can't you turn me up
Girl, I'm coming around
Turn me up
Girl I'm falling down
I'm always just following the best suggestion
Turn me up, I'm coming around
Turn me up, I'm falling down
I'm always just following the best suggestion

And if I held in the dark, you can still remember
And there was never alright, since I'm alone?
As soon as I move away

Said hold on tight, you're coming to get me
All alone, I won't go, for you
I'm always just following the best suggestion
All alone, will go

Why can't you turn me up
Girl, I'm coming around
Turn me up
Girl I'm falling down
I'm always just following the best suggestion
Turn me up, I'm coming around
Turn me up, I'm falling down
I'm always just following the best suggestion

I'm always just following the best suggestion
Turn me up, I'm coming around
Turn me up, I'm coming down
I'm always just following the best suggestion
