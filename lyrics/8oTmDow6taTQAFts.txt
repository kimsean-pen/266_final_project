I get a shiver when you come around here
Lose my voice when your body's near
Are you really no good or is it just talk?
You say you get bored with every girl
Losing trust in every girl
But I'm not like them, I hope you see it

Can I be the one, to change your mind?
Can I be the one, to trip the wire?
Sound the alarm, cause I'm breaking down
Maybe I wanna take you out, maybe, baby I wanna break you down

Tell my friends I'm staying in
I don't mind a little lyin'
Cause they think you're no good but they don't know you
I sit around, await your call
Phone that's watched never rings at all
Such a busy man but I understand

Can I be the one, to change your mind?
Can I be the one, to trip the wire?
Sound the alarm, cause I'm breaking down
Maybe I wanna take you out, maybe, baby I wanna break you down

Can I, can I be your first try
Take the leap and make me feel
Like I, like I'm not wasting time
Just a puppy at your heel
And I don't care what they say
It's me and you
But don't prove them right
Please don't let me fall
Through, oh

Can I be the one
Sound the alarm, cause I'm breaking down
