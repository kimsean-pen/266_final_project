A heavy breathing I can hear
When midnight brings the smell of fear
A weeping soul is moving fast
It's waiting for the world collapse

And I'm falling
I'm falling in love with the feet
As I hear you run away
I'll follow
I'll follow your dance in the street
Until I find what you are looking for

My life can't be true
If I'm passing through
Only thing I do
Thinking of you

I'm flying in the light of moon
That's why I'm made of, I assume
I must regret I wish I could
Leave in your body exit wound

And I'm falling
I'm falling in love with the feet
As I hear you run away
I'll follow
I'll follow your dance in the street
Until I find what you are looking for

My life can't be true
If I'm passing through
Only thing I do
Thinking of you

Every time I'm going through
Am I hurting you?
Every time I'm going through
Baby, it's not true
