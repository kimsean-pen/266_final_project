hey hey can you feel it
the way it --- you
the thump in your chest
you make my feet move
you turn my head ---
that's why i love you the best
hey you fill up the spaces
those empty places
the corners and cracks
you kill my sickness
my only witness
you're all that i have
that's how we like
we like what we like
that's what we like
we love which is you
we got an eye
an eye for what's romance
we've got our eyes
our eyes straight on you
you watch us dance
we dance till we're dying
we dance to free ourselves from the room
we love the sound
the sound is what found us
the sound is the blood between me and you
back when i had no story
living a folly (?)
you got under my skin
you were my make up
my -------
my reason to move
can't stop the bleeding
no this leaving though i've tried
and when i return

hey you've got me crawling
you've got me spinning
shake, shimmy, shake
first you --- me, then resurrect me
too much
that's how we like
we like what we like
that's what we like
we love which is you
we got an eye
an eye for what's romance
we've got our eyes
our eyes straight on you
you watch us dance
we dance till we're dying
we dance to free ourselves from the room
we love the sound
the sound is what found us
the sound is the blood between me and you
that's how we like what we like
that's what we like
we love which is you
we've got an ear
an ear for what's romance
we've got our ears
our ears straight on you
you watch us sing
we sing till we're crying
we sing to free ourselves from the room
we love the sound
the sound is what found us
the sound is the blood (love?) between me and you
