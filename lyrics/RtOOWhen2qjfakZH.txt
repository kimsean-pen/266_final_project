You know that I've been told you're kissed by the sun
I feel it in my bones when I know you'll come around
You know that I've been told summertime will come
I feel it even more and I choose you every time

Baby, you shut down my eyes
No one's ever made me fly like you

You know that I've been told you're kissed by the sun
What's it all good for if you're not always on my mind?
You know that I've been told summertime will come
You're all that I adore and I want to see you downtown

And baby, you shut down my eyes
No one's ever made me fly like you
And the weekends go by
I'll be dreaming on the whole night through
