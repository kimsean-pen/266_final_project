A rider came from far away
To tell a story to the king
He was a saint in armour
Find the sole crusader
Take him to the cliff let him see the vultures
The phantoms of the universe

Rage is a sin and we're all giving in
Let the weapons of evil rust
The death machine wont wait until tomorrow

Don't fear the new revelation
No more reign of blood
You must stand united, side by side
It's a new revelation
Save our troops tonight
While metal hails are falling on their shields
On the shields

Raiders from the Underworld...

Raiders from the Underworld
Live by the rules of slaying or be tamed
It's hard to kill dead creatures

Outcast in euphoria
Dwell in the tombs of dark illusions
Be brothers of deliverance

Fathers and sons let us gather as one
Fight together until the end
The war machine won't stop before tomorrow

Don't fear the new revelation
No more reign of blood
You must stand united side by side
It's a new revelation
Save our troops tonight
While metal hails are falling on their shields

No more reign of blood...
On the shields...
You got to start to march

The conclusion of life
Is it only a paradox?
Wanna be in a coward's shape?
Cast your chains, victory will cost
