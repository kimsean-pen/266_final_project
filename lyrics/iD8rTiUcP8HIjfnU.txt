Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay
Were laid spread out before me, as her body once did
All all five horizons, revolved around her soul...
As the Earth to the Sun
Now, the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn

Ooh, and all I taught her was... everything
Ooh, I know she gave me all... that she wore
And now my bitter hands, chafe beneath the clouds of what was everything
All the pictures have all been washed in black
Tattooed everything

I take a walk outside
I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear?

Mmm, and twisted thoughts that spin around my head
I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning
How quick the Sun can drop away
And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass... of what was everything
All the pictures have, all been washed in black
Tattooed everything

All the love gone bad, turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all that I'll be, yeah

I know that someday you'll have a beautiful life, I know you'll be a star
In somebody else's sky...
But why, why, why can't it be... can't it be mine?
Ah, yeah
