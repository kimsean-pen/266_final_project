I'm the light in your shed
Shining thru your bedroom window
Keeping you awake
I'm the thoughts in your head
I'm every word you never said
Keeping you awake
Remember me with a smile on my face
So when I'm gone you can know I'm in a better place

I'm not so sure
About anything anymore
I guess I got what I asked for
(I guess I got what I asked for)
I've been so sore
From always sleeping on the floor
I don't wanna do this anymore
(I don't wanna do this anymore)
(I don't wanna do this anymore)

Yeah, yeah, yeah
What's the point of waking up?
Why can't I give a fuck?
How can I see the bright side
When the blinds closed and I'm stuck?
You say I'll get it when I'm older
I'm getting closer no closure
Now I'm feeling like it's over
We don't even have to go there
Like damn
Look at my life
Tell me why I can't do anything right
Don't wanna complain so I keep it inside
Losing my mind, wide awake every night
Remember the days at the old cul-de-sac
Feel like that shit was a dream looking back
Now I can't help that I live in the past where nothing will last

I'm not so sure
About anything anymore
I guess I got what I asked for
(I guess I got what I asked for)
I've been so sore
From always sleeping on the floor
I don't wanna do this anymore
(I don't wanna do this anymore)

(I'm not so sure)
(About anything anymore)
(I guess I got what I asked for)

(I guess I got what I asked for)
(I don't wanna do this anymore)

I'm not so sure
About anything anymore
I guess I got what I asked for
(I guess I got what I asked for)
I've been so sore
From always sleeping on the floor
I don't wanna do this anymore
(I don't wanna do this anymore)
