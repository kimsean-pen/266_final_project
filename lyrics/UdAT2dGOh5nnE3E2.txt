I had a dream
This one I feel the need to mention
I was happy for awhile
And I stopped being scared and ashamed
To say what's on my mind
But you thought I'd change after awhile
And said "you'd better treat me different or else"
"Or else" seems like a stupid fucking thing to say to someone like me
Someone like me
Wow, wow, wow
Wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow

Don't be surprised I can look you in the eye
It's hard to take you serious when you take me inside
Don't be surprised I can look you in the eye
It's hard to take you serious when you take me inside

I'm worse
Than what you think you'd catch from me
Complicated's understated
Did you stop and take a look at who you fell in love with?
At who you fell in love with

It doesn't matter
How many times I say it
It never gets old
That's why I have to say
Wow, wow, wow
Wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow

Don't be surprised I can look you in the eye
It's hard to take you serious when you take me inside
Don't be surprised I can look you in the eye
It's hard to take you serious when you take me inside

It doesn't matter if you're going to come or just going
I never wanted you to come here anyway
There's a word that's like you
Because it can be a noun, a verb, a exclamation, or the thing I say

When something is unbelievable
When I'm not able to believe how unbelievably unbelievable
That you believe you could not be leave-able
That's when I have to say
Wow, wow, wow
Wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow

Don't be surprised I can look you in the eye
It's hard to take you serious when you take me inside
Don't be surprised I can look you in the eye
It's hard to take you serious when you take me inside
It doesn't matter
How many times I say it
It never gets old
That's why I have to say
Wow
