Shall we take a trip down memory lane?
Head in the clouds into the acid rain
Time means nothing I can smell the trees
Chase that rainbow with the summer breeze

Sing LSD, Sing LSD, ahor, ahor, ahor,
Ahor, Answers Come In Dreams
Ahor, ahor, oorh, ahor, ahor
Ahor, these Answers Come In Dreams

We shall rock!
Let's see you rock!
Ooohhh oooohhh rock

Defy all logic and brave the storm
Mother nature beside you do you feel warm?
Flashback to your days of youth
You've been there once, you're living proof

Sing LSD, Sing LSD, ahor, ahor, ahor,
Ahor, Answers Come In Dreams
Ahor, ahor, oorh, ahor, ahor
Ahor, these Answers Come In Dreams

We shall rock!
Let's see you rock!
Ooohhh oooohhh rock

And follow the trails off the fairies tails
In a day glo sheen, where no one fails
Altered States and a new ID
Open your eyes and sing with me
