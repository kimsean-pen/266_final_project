We're always watching
We're always waiting
We're always loving
We're always hating

As they call treason, treason
Shout, scream
In your nightmare
We're all so happy
We're all so happy
As they call treason, treason

Shout and scream

She's always lonely
She's always hinting
Red lips smiling
Blue eyes glinting

As they call treason, treason
Shot, scream
In your nightmare
We're all so happy
We're all so happy
As they call treason, treason

Shout (repeat)
We're all so happy
Shout (repeat)
Scream

We're only watching
We're only waiting
We're only loving
We're only hating

As they call treason, treason
Shout, scream
In your nightmare
We're all so happy
We're all so happy
As they call treason, treason

Shout
We're all so happy
Treason, treason
