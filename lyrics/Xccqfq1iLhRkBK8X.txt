I.I.I.I.I.I need, I need you
I.I.I.I.I.I need, I need you
I.I.I.I.I.I need, I need you

I never said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
No, baby
But this good lovin' I can't keep it to myself
Oh, no
When we're together it's like hot coals in a fire
Hot, baby
My body's burnin' so come on heat my desire
Come on, come on

Two of hearts, two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts, I need you, I need you
Two of hears, two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts, come on, come on

People get jealous 'cause we always stay together
Yeah, baby
I guess they really want a love like yours and mine
Together, forever
I never thought that I could ever be this happy
Yeah, baby
My prayers were answered boy, you came in the nick of time
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I've got this feelin' that you're going to stay
I never knew that it could happen this way
Before I met you I was fallin' apart
But now at last I really know that we are

Two of hearts, two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts, I need you, I need you
Two of hearts, two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts, come on, come on

I.I.I.I.I.I need, I need you
I.I.I.I.I.I need
I.I.I.I.I.I need
I need you, I need you

I never said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
No, baby
But this good lovin' I can't keep it to myself
Oh, no
When we're together it's like hot coals in a fire
Hot, baby
My body's burnin' so come on heat my desire
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I've got this feelin' that you're going to stay
I never knew that it could happen this way
Before I met you I was fallin' apart
But now at last I really know that we are
Two of hearts, two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts, I need you, I need you
Two of hearts, two hearts that beat as one
Two of hearts, come on, come on
