I'm not looking for someone to talk to
I've got my friends, I'm more than okay
I've got more than a girl could wish for
I live my dreams, but it's not all they say

Still I believe
(I'm missing...)

I'm missing something real
I need someone who really sees me
(Don't want to wake...)
Don't want to wake up alone anymore

Still believing you'll walk through my door
All I need is to know it's for sure
Then I'll give all the love in the world
I've often wondered, if love's an illusion

Just to get you through, the loneliest days
I can't criticize it, I had no hesitations
My imagination, just stole me away

(But still...)
But still I believe
(I'm missing...)

I'm missing something real
I need someone who really sees me
(Don't want to wake...)
Don't want to wake up alone anymore
Still believing you'll walk through my door

All I need is to know it's for sure

Then I'll give all the love in the world
Love's for a lifetime
Not for a moment
So how could i throw it away (yeah...)
I'm only human
And nights grow colder
With no one to love me that wa-a-ay (yea-ah)
I need someone who real-ly sees me
(Don't want to wake...)
And I won't wake up alone anymore
Still believing you'll walk through my door
You'll reach for me and I'll know it's for, sure
Then I'll give all the love in the world
Don't wanna wake up alone anymore (more...)
Don't wanna wake up alone anymore...
