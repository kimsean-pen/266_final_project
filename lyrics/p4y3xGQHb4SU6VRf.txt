Turn up that good music
You know that's the shit we like
Tell the neighbors cool it
'Cause they bitchin' all the time
Hell if I know, hell if I know
When I'll get back home tonight
Hell if I know, hell if I know
But I know that I'll be high
Soon as I get out of bed I
Roll one and I smoke up
Got to change my head
Car wash, sittin' in my Benz
I roll one and I smoke up
Always keep it lit
'Cause we high rollin', high rollin', high rollin'
Yeah we high rollin', high rollin', high rollin'
Yeah I fuck with your girl
'Cause I'm keeping that shit tight
If you could see my aura
You'd know even that stays high
Hell if I know, hell if I know
If my chakras are aligned
Hell if I know, hell if I know
But I know I'm gon' be high
Soon as I get out of bed I
Roll one and I smoke one
Got to change my head
Car wash, sittin' in my Benz I
Roll one and I smoke one
Always keep it lit
'Cause we high rollin', high rollin', high rollin'
Yeah we high rollin', high rollin', high rollin'
'Cause we high rollin', high rollin', high rollin'
Yeah we high rollin', high rollin', high rollin'
Hangin' with Jane everyday
Take me away, take me away
Hangin' with Jane everyday
Take me away, take me away
Soon as I get out of bed I
Roll one and I smoke up
Got to change my head
Car wash, sittin' in my Benz
I roll one and I smoke up
Always keep it lit
'Cause we high rollin', high rollin', high rollin'
Yeah we high rollin', high rollin', high rollin'
'Cause we high rollin', high rollin', high rollin'
Yeah we high rollin', high rollin', high rollin'
