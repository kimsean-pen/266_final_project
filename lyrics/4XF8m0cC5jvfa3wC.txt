I've been erased from the old me
Can you tell me again
Can you hold me up
I won't relate to the morning sun
It pulls you out and takes you under

I thought you'd hate me
But I needed you
I thought you'd hate me
But you needed truth
I thought you'd hate me, hate me, hate me
For losing you
I thought you knew

That we're cut out of the same cloth
Like the pages of a story that we can't stop
And now I can't replace you with another thread
Take one more step
I'll jump with you

I thought you'd hate me
But I needed you
I thought you'd hate me
But you needed truth
I thought you'd hate me, hate me, hate me
For losing you
I thought you knew

Looking back at your beauty
It came crashing down
You'll think I'll forget that
Never gonna take it back (at your beauty, you know where I lie)
Looking back at your bullshit
It came crashing down
You'll think I'll forget that
Never gonna take it back (at your bullshit, you know who I am)
I thought you knew

It's hard enough you standing next to me
Your scent reviving moments spent with you
I need to know that you believe in this
Or just release them into deja vu

I never wanted you to understand (understand)
I wanna make you believe in me

I thought you'd hate me
But I needed you
I thought you'd hate me
But you needed truth
I thought you'd hate me, hate me, hate me
For losing you
I thought you'd hate me
But I needed you
I thought you'd hate me
But you needed truth
I thought you'd hate me, hate me, hate me
For losing you
I thought you knew
