I ain't got to much to swag
I got too much to swag
That's why, I ain't got no friends
I'm too confident
I ain't got to much to swag
I got too much to swag

I'm too confident

'Cause something's in the water
Leave that shit at the alter

We need to wake up
We need to wake up

Had to take, then had to let go
Had to take, then had to let go
Had to take, then had to let go
Had to take, then had to let go
Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm

I ain't got to much to swag
I got too much to swag
That's why, I ain't got no friends
I'm too confident
I ain't got to much to swag
I got too much to swag
That's why, I ain't got no friends
I'm too confident
