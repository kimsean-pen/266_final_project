A happy new year to you all

Goodnight, everyone

Lie with me now
Under lemon tree skies
Show me the shy slow smile you keep hidden by warm brown eyes
Catch the sweet hover of lips just barely apart
And wonder at loves sweet ache and the wild beat of my heart
Oh, rhapsody tearing me apart

And I dreamed I was saying goodbye to my child
She was taking a last look at the sea
Wading through dreams
Up to our knees in warm ocean swells
While bathing belles
Soft beneath hard bitten shells punch their iPhones
Erasing the numbers of redundant lovers and search the horizon
And you'll find my child
Down by the shore
Digging around for a chain or a bone
Searching the sand for a relic washed up by the sea

The last refugee
