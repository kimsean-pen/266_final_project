Old friend
it's been a long time
since I've seen you
whooo ooh
these days
we know nothing
just a memory youthful days
whoo ooh
all say
your crime is over
your hair is shorter
but you're still the same
you know
the seasons change (seasons will change)
you know
we'll always be the same
well it's nice to see you again
my friend, my friend
well it's nice to see you again
my friend, my friend
oh it's nice to see you again
my friend, my friend
oh it's nice to see you again
my friend, my friend
all again because of you
always be kind to you
old in the colour blue
always be friends with you
whoo ooh
