Take whatever
You can leave on me but nothing
It's in your nature
I know what you're doing

You could be the dealer, I could be the stash
You could be the fire, I could be the ash
I could be your first babe, you could be my last
And we gon make it last 'cause I can't say no
But i'm scared of getting burned if I get too close
And now you got me where you want me cause i'm on the ropes
Baby, don't make me rush
'Cause I only wanna save you slow

And breathe you in like smoke
Would you let me watch you low?
And let me breathe you in like smoke
And would you let me watch you low?

Time is slipping
I don't wanna waste a moment
Precious madness
With you I can afford it
