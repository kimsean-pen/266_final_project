Cease to resist, giving my goodbye
Drive my car into the ocean
You'll think I'm dead, but I sail away

On a wave of mutilation, wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation, wave, wave

I've kissed mermaids, rode the El Nino
Walked the sand with the crustaceans
Could find my way to Mariana

On a wave of mutilation, wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation, wave, wave
Wave of mutilation, wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation, wave, wave
