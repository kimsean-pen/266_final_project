I need for you to worry
As seed of truth is burning
Something's slowly starving you when you aren't listening
No no no
Gave you every part of me
Maybe you are mentally
Slow slow slow
You're just no good for me, I'm in dying breed
Two hearts, they breed in sick
But they can never be
Something's slowly starving you
When you aren't listening
No no no
Gave you every part of me
Maybe you're mentally
Slow slow slow
So get out, get out of my head
Just get out, get out of my head
Just get out, get out of my head
Before I cave in
So get out, get out of my head
Just get out, get out of my head
Just get out, get out of my head
Before I cave in
You've got your creep
I need as just a way you need
To hell with you and everything you take from me
Something's slowly starving you
When you aren't listening
No no no
Gave you every part of me
Maybe you're mentally
Slow slow slow
So get out, get out of my head
Just get out, get out of my head
Just get out, get out of my head
Before I cave in
So get out, get out of my head
Just get out, get out of my head
Just get out, get out of my head
Before I cave in
Something's slowly starving you when you aren't listening
No no no
Gave you every part of me
Maybe you're mentally
Slow slow slow
So get out, get out of my head
Just get out, get out of my head
Just get out, get out of my head
Before I cave in
So get out, get out of my head
Just get out, get out of my head
Just get out, get out of my head
Before I cave in
So get out, get out of my head
Just get out, get out of my head
Just get out, get out of my head
Before I cave in
