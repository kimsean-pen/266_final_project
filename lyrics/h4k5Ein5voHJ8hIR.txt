I pulled away to face the pain
I close my eyes and drift away
Over the fear
That I will never find a way to heal my soul
And I will wander till the end of time
Torn away from you

My heart is broken
Sweet sleep, my dark angel
Deliver us from sorrow's hold
Over my heart

I can't go on living this way
I can't go back the way I came
Chained of this fear
That I will never find the way to heal my soul
And I will wander till the end of the time
Half alive without you

My heart is broken
Sweet sleep, my dark angel
Deliver us

Change
Open your eyes to the light
I've denied it all so long, oh so long
Say goodbye, goodbye

My heart is broken
Sweet sleep, my dark angel
Deliver us

My heart is broken
Sweet sleep, my dark angel
Deliver us

My heart is broken
Sweet sleep, my dark angel
Deliver us from sorrow's hold
