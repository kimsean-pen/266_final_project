Make me a deal and make it straight
All signed and sealed, I'll take it
To Robert E. Lee, I'll show it
I hope and pray he don't blow it 'cause
We've been around a long time
Just tryin' to, tryin' to but you
Make the big time
Take me on a roller coaster
Take me for an airplane ride
Take me for a six days wonder but
Don't you, don't you throw my pride aside besides
What's real and make believe
Baby Jane's in Acapulco
We are flyin' down to Rio
Throw me a line, I'm sinking fast
Clutching at straws, can't make it
Havana sound, we're trying
Hard edge, the hipster jiving
Last picture shows down the drive-in
You're so sheer, you're so chic
Teenage rebel of the week
Flavors of the mountain streamline
Midnight blue casino floors
Dance the cha-cha through till sunrise
Opens up exclusive doors, oh wow
Just like flamingos, look the same
So me and you, just we two
Got to search for something new
Far beyond the pale horizon
Some place near the desert strand
Where my Studebaker takes me
That's where I'll make my stand but wait
Can't you see that Holzer mane'
What's her name? Virginia Plain
