These are the times that will challenge our resolve
Living in the days of the fallen
A voice that once spoke of strength and hope
Now sings the dirge of the hopeless

You can not break
This love with hate
A tribute to the fallen
Your choice is made
So go your way
A tribute to the fallen

With a new dawn we rise in renewed strength
Knowing we've just begun
To fight this war within

You can not break
This love with hate
A tribute to the fallen
Your choice is made
So go your way
A tribute to the fallen

Walk the path you've chosen
Our faith remains unbroken
Even if we die tonight
This is an endless fight
Our spirits will live on
In the hearts of those we leave behind
With broken bones
And our will of stone
In the end we will not stand alone

You can not break
This love with hate
A tribute to the fallen
Your choice is made
So go your way
A tribute to the fallen
A tribute to the fallen
A tribute to the fallen

(You can not break)
(This love with hate)
(A tribute to the fallen)
(Your choice is made)
(So go your way)
