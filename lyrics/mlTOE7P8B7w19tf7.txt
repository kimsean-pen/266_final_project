You blew it if you try, little sister
You're blowin' it sky high, little sister
You killed your brother when you blew his brain
You're high on money and your lover's pain
An' kiss your mommy with your life again, oh-oh

Oh was it a good time? Oh was it a good time?
Oh was it a good time? Oh was it a good time?
Good time, good time, good time, good time

Broken little sister, broken little sister
Broken little sister, broken little sister
Sister, sister, sister, sister
