Taking the second plan,
Begging to understand,
Life of a selfless man.

'Cos out of all the flaws I've stumbled on,
It's the hardest one to focus on.
It's the hardest one to focus on.

Why're you calling on?
Isn't one enough?
Giving up all she's got.

'Cos out of all the flaws I've stumbled on,
It's the hardest one to focus on.
It's the hardest one to focus on.
