Someone tell me why
I do the things
That i don't wanna do
When you're around me.I'm somebody else
Someone tell me why I act like a fool
When things don't go my way
When you're around me
I'm somebody else

There is good reason I guess
Having once gone too far
When you clean out the hive
Does it make you wanna cry
I'm still being followed by the Teenage FBI

(CHORUS)
Someone tell me why
Someone tell me why
Someone tell me why I do the things
That i don't wanna do
When you're around me
I'm somebody else
Someone tell me why
Someone tell me why

Someone tell me why I do the things
That I don't wanna do
When you're around me
I'm somebody else
Someone tell me why I act like a fool
When things don't go my way
When you're around me
I'm somebody else

There is good reason i guess
Having once gone to far
When you clean out the hive
Does it make you wanna cry
I'm still being followed by the Teenage FBI

(Repeat Chorus)
