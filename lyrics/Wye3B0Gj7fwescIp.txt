Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-OH!
This world keeps pushing down upon me
And I keep hoping for a sweet dream

There's something left for me to see
There's something left for me to be

We can't ponder on this world forever
You know we can save this, if together
Growing, day by day to make it
But my time's been wasted

And while my eyes are open wide
I'm sound asleep on the inside

Wake me up from this dream that never ends
Haunting me, haunting me till my bitter end
Wake me up from this nightmare that I live
Something inside of me keeps on giving in

Well I keep searching for an answer
But time will never tell
And you will never know
My choices are my own
But I can't choose where I call home
This life's not carved stone
This life has left on my own

And while my eyes are open wide
I'm sound asleep

Wake me up from this dream that never ends
Haunting me, haunting me till my bitter end
Wake me up from this nightmare that I live
Something inside of me keeps on giving in

WAKE ME UP
Ruff

I'm wide awake! I'm not afraid anymore!
I'm wide awake, it's you who helped me win this war
Wake me up from this dream that never ends
Haunting me, Haunting me 'til my better end...
Wake me up from this nightmare that I live
Something inside of me keeps on giving in
Wake me up from this dream that never ends
Haunting me, Haunting me 'til my bitter end...
Wake me up from this nightmare that I live
Something inside of me keeps on giving in
