And since I met you
I spent every night with all the guys
Who's to see you in pictures hanging on my walls
When shadows fall.

I had a lot of waves,
Baby, they're breaking on you.
It's been time like these
And I will save a little grin.

Do you really want to?
I can't sleep since I met you.
All the mistakes that I go through, I love you
And I want you back, baby.

Before I met you I was counting and confident
Now these feelings I'm showing, they're just hanging there, in you.

I had a lot of waves,
Baby, they're breaking on you.
It's been time like these
And I will save a little grin.

Do you really want to?
I can't sleep since I met you.
All the mistakes that I go through, I love you
And I want you back, baby.

It's been time like these
And I will save a little grin.

Do you really want to?
I can't sleep since I met you.
All the mistakes that I go through, I love you
And I want you back, baby.

Do you really want to?
I can't sleep since I met you.
All the mistakes that I go through, I love you
And I want you back, baby
