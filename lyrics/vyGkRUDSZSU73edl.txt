I always pass on cigarettes,
But ill spill my smoke straight into your lungs.
My words will pierce so don't forget i ship a loaded gun. Yes i do
Cause you're the perfect man,
you're the perfect man, the perfect man. In your head.
Mr perfect man, who are you to judge.
When you're living life like you're already dead.
I was not born just yesterday so
don't you patronize me for the way i look.
I ain't no sheep so shave your ...and i ain't no fish so ...
You're the perfect man, you're the perfect man... in your head.
Mr perfect man will are you to judge when
you live your life like your already dead.
I hurt behind your angry eyes,
it's not my prize. so don't you look at me.
I hold my heart out for the most,
but for your soul i got no sympathy... no i don't.
Cause you're the perfect man...
in your head. Mr perfect man who are you to judge...
