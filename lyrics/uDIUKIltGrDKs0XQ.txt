You're way ahead of me
When it comes to articulating
The arts of empathy
And communicating how you feel
I don't know how to love
I evaporate
And dissipate into curls of smoke
I deteriorate

Don't know how to love
Don't know how to love
Don't know how to love

If somehow you can see
There's no emergency
And please go figure out
What love is not about

I don't know how to love

Release your heart to me
To me in particular
And claim that you love me
Exclusively
Then let me remain
Unconditionally
So I can figure out what love is all about

I wanna know
I wanna know
What love is all about

I don't know how to love

Don't know how to love
Don't know how to love
Don't know how to love

If somehow you can see
There's no emergency
And please go figure out
What love is not about

Don't know how to love
Don't know how to love
Don't know how to love

If somehow you can see
If somehow
There's no emergency
I wanna know
And please go figure out
What love is all about
