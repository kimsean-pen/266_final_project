All along
Caught in the battle of right and wrong
Cause all I ever knew
Was to compromise, be polite
But will I be biting my tongue for life?
No
So I'm gonna drive tonight
Oh-oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Until we see the light
Oh-oh no no no no
And we say yeah yeah yeah yeah
No no no no
My way or the highway
I'm gonna drive tonight
Away from the city life
Oh-oh
See I'm gonna drive tonight
Away from the city life
All we know
We're begging for someone to
break the mold
Cause everybody else has forgot they ever had the choice
But if we give in then we'll miss the point, no
No no no no
So I'm gonna drive tonight
Oh-oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Until we see the light
Oh-oh no no no no
And we say yeah yeah yeah yeah
No no no no
My way or the highway
I'm gonna drive tonight
Oh-oh
Away from the city life
Whoo-hoo whoo-hooo
Well I believe in something
They don't understand
Whoo-hoo whoo-hooo
I'm leaving here to say I'm done with
You holding me back
So I'm gonna drive tonight
Oh-oh yeah yeah yeah
Until we see the light
Oh-oh no no no
And we say yeah yeah yeah yeah
No no no no
My way or the highway
I'm gonna drive tonight
Oh-oh
So I'm gonna drive tonight
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Until we see the light
Oh-oh
Till we see till we see till we see the light
And we say yeah yeah yeah yeah
No no no no
My way or the highway
I'm gonna drive tonight
Away from the city life
So I'm gonna drive tonight
Away from the city life
