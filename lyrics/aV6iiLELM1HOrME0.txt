Well, I saw fireworks from the freeway
And behind closed eyes, I cannot make them go away
'Cause you were born on the fourth of July, freedom ring
Well, something on the surface it stinks
Well, something on the surface
It kind of makes me nervous
To say that you deserve this
And what kind of God would serve this
We will cure this dirty old disease

Well, if you you've got the poison, I've got the remedy
The remedy is the experience, this is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words

I said, the tragedy is that you're going to spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
Well, it all amounts to nothing in the end

I won't worry my life away
Say, I won't worry my life away

Well, I heard two men, talking on the radio
In a crossfire kind of new reality show
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack
Or they were counting down the ways to stab
The brother in the be right back after this
The unavoidable kiss, with a minty fresh death-breath
Is sure to outlast this catastrophe dance with me

Well, if you've got the poison and baby I'm your remedy
The remedy is the experience, this is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words

I said, the tragedy is that you're going to spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
Well, it all amounts to nothing in the end

Oh, Lord
I won't, I won't worry my life away
Say, I, I won't worry my life away

When I fall in love now
I take my time, there's no need to hurry
When I'm making up my mind
You can turn off the sun, but I'm still going to shine
And I'll tell you why

Because the remedy is always the experience
And it's a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
And is a play on words

I said, the tragedy is that you're going to spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
Well, it all amounts to nothing in the end

Oh, Lord
I won't, I won't worry my life away
Say, I, I won't worry my life away

Not today, I won't, I won't, I won't
Worry this life away
Oh, ain't worrying this no more
I said I won't, I won't, I won't
Worry this life away tonight, tonight
'Cause we got to feel more, oh
