It's easy enough to lure myself
Out of my house if I don't think about

All my limits
I'm on my feet
I'm on my way
I'm wandering

It's easy enough, though, to
Lie myself back down
It's simple, it's like
I just remember how

All my limits have held me back
I hold my head and I let it ask

Why
I'm altogether down
And when will it end now?

It's easy enough to lie to myself
My eye, my carnivore
Circling appetite

All my limits
I'm on my feet
I'm on my way
But I'm wondering
Why
I'm all together down
And when will it end now?

I'm wondering why
I'm altogether down
And when will it end now?
