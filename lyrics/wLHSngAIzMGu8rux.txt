I'm down by the fire
At the ocean side
Just waiting for that underwater world to say good night

Don't you hear that sound?
From that tide and send
They'll tell us to keep rowing and rowing if we can

So I've learnt to keep my head in this lazy wonderland

Well you had to know
that I had to know
The tricks for us not to be found out
There's a place we can go
The trip is on but we can find a way

(Tonight we'll go)
Laughing all the way, my love
(Tomorrow we'll go)
Back in time to live today

To all the men who ride
in the morning light? at the ending of another lovely night

And I've misplaced my mind, don't know how or why
and when it wonders back I hope it's still a friend of mine

Well you had to know
that I had to know
the tricks for us not to be found out
and there's a place we can go
The trip is on but we can find a way

(Tonight we'll go)
Laughing all the way, my love
(Tomorrow we'll go)
Back in time to live today
