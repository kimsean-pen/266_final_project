When all that's left to do
Is reflect on what's been done
This is where sadness breaths
The sadness of everyone

Just like when the guys built the dam at otter creek
and all the water backed up
Deep enough to dive

We took the dead man in sheets
To the river flanked by love
Deep enough to dive
Deep enough to dive

Be here now
Be here now
Be here now
Be here now

Just like when the guys built the dam at otter creek
and all the water backed up, backed up, backed up
Deep enough to dive

We took him there and three
In a stretcher made from trees
That had passed in the storm
Leave the hearse behind
To leave the curse behind

Be here now
Be here now
Be here now
Be here now
Be here now

We took the dead man in sheets
To the river flanked by love
We took the dead man in sheets
To the river flanked by love

Be here now
Be here now
Be here now
Be here now
Be here now
