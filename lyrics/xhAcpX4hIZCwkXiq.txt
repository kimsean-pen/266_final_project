Spend the days throwing rocks at the nearby beacon light
And the nights afraid of the dark hiding inside
Draw the curtains and close your eyes
It's the dead of night
It's pitch black outside
"I'm quietly reading
A story of a widow's lonely life."

Spend the days throwing rocks at the nearby beacon light
And the nights afraid of the dark hiding inside
Draw the curtains and close your eyes
It's the dead of night
It's pitch black outside

"I'm quietly reading
A story of a widow's lonely life."
How do you sleep at night?
How do you sleep at night?

The author is dead
The widow is dead
