Moonrise (Through Mirrors Of Death) by Nevermore
Turn to the left, turn to the right
If you judge me for my faults
My soul searches for flight
Awake in my violent daydreams
I am lucid and torn
I sleep, dreaming in the netherworld
Obsessed and reborn
I feel the moonrise
Inside my head
I feel the consequence
Of everything you left unsaid
And now you're dead...
Is this soliloquy or psychosis
Or self-hypnosis
Burn to the right, turn to the left
If society won't accept you
You scream into the grave
Welcome to the underground
Welcome to your grave
Welcome to your beautiful mistake
I feel the moonrise
Inside my head
I feel the consequence
Of everything you left unsaid
And now we're dead...
[Solo]
Turn away from the light
Turn into the right
If you judge me for my faults
My soul searches for flight
Welcome to the underground
Welcome to your grave
Welcome to your beautiful mistake
I feel the moonrise
Inside my head
I feel the consequence
Of everything you left unsaid
And now we're dead...
