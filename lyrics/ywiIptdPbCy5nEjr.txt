You get high with your destructive instinct
You get high with your corrosive instinct
Where can I go to escape your foul mind trick
You're trying it more but you will never break me
'Cause you presume the winner is you but that's not true
So say just words to me
Unreal what's your hate providing
Say just words to me
Your talk is always contradiction
Say just words to me
You won't feel the warmth of friends around you
Say just words to me
Is it true that there is worth inside
So say just words to me
Your desings, all the worse from power craving
Your desires, only where there's fire burning
I'll show you the way a pleasure that's for the taking
You're trying it more but you won't get satisfaction
'Cause you presume the winner is you but that's not true
So say just words to me.
Unreal what's your hate providing
Say just words to me
Your talk is always contradiction
Say just words to me
You won't feel the warmth of friends around you
Say just words to me
Is it true that there is worth inside
So say just words to me

Unreal what's your hate providing
Say just words to me
Your talk is always contradiction
Say just words to me
You won't feel the warmth of friends around you
Say just words to me
Is it true that there is worth inside
So say just words to me
