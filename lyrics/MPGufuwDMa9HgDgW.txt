Lower and lower, my soul sinking lower
Living for indulgence, the trinity of man
Me, myself, and I

Higher and higher, my greed takes me higher
All those below me I've cast aside
Clawing at their flesh to reach the heavens above

Deeper and deeper, my mind sinking deeper
When is too much enough to throw it all away
Stab my allies in the back just to seize the day

Lesser and lesser, my life feeling lesser
Loathing what I am, the lower form of life
The blood on my hands will never wash away

Mad with guilt, spiraling out of control
Cold with hate for myself and what I've become
All that's held me together is broken but will I fall
My twisted ambitions still calling, the voices I can't ignore

Not even God can save me now
That flame burned out long ago
All my ways of sin and greed
Are the only passions I know

Darker and darker
My soul gets even darker
Moving ever closer to the depths from which I can never return
