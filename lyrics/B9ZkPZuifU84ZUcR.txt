Well baby, there you stand
With your little head down
in your hand
Oh my God, you can't believe it's happening again
Your baby's gone and you're all alone, and it looks like the end
You're back out on the street...

And you're trying to remember, oh...
How do you start it over
You don't know if you can
You don't care much for a stranger's touch
But you can't hold your man
You never thought you'd be alone this far down the line

But I know what's been
on your mind
You're afraid it's all been wasted time
The autumn leaves have got you thinking

About the first time that you fell, fell
You didn't love the boy too much
No-no you just loved the boy too well, well, well
So you live from day to day
And you dream about tomorrow
And the hours go by like minutes

And the shadows come to stay
So you, you take a little something to make them
go away...
And I could have done so many things baby
If I could only stop my mind
from wondering what I left behind
And from worrying about this wasted time

(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
The love has come and gone
(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
The years keep rushing on
I remember (a-a-a-h...) what you told me
Before you went out on
your own
Sometimes to (a-a-a-h...) keep it together
You got to leave it alone...
So you can get on with your search baby
And I can get on with mine
And maybe someday we
will find
That it wasn't really wasted time
O-h-oh oh-oh-oh...
Oh... hoo... hoo-hoo...
M-m-m-m... m-m-m-
H-m-m-m m-m-m-m...
