i made friends with a ghost
we hang out almost every night
when i'm lying in my bed
he creeps into my head
he fills me with dread
and everything is fine
i made friends with a creep
he sticks a needle in his arm
when i'm lying in my bed
he stole everything i had
i still let him hang around
cause everything is fine
