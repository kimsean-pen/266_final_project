I just want to find a group of minds
People that are like me
Nobody's quite like me
I could leave my close friends far behind
Join a peaceful movement
Together we could do it

'Cause we have the whole summer
Places to discover
We could put our love and trust in one another
For the whole summer
Only growing younger
I could be your sister, you could be my brother

Every letter from the leader will change our lives
We are the receivers
He is the perceiver
How can I see if they often lie
Have too many questions
Looking for an answer

But we have the whole summer
Places to discover
We could put our love and trust in one another
For the whole summer
Only growing younger
I could be your sister, you could be my brother
For all summer
We can be discovered
They tried to control us, now they'll never touch us
For the whole summer
Only growing younger
I could be your sister, you could be my brother
I could be your sister, you could be my brother
