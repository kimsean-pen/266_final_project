Polaroid of you dancing in my room
I want to remember
I think it was about noon
It's getting harder to understand, to understand
How you felt in my hands (in my hands)

I could be a pretty girl, I'll wear a skirt for you
I could be a pretty girl, shut up when you want me too
I could be a pretty girl, won't ever make you blue
I could be a pretty girl, I'll lose myself in you

I was so blinded by you, now I cry
Just thinkin' 'bout the fool that I was
I was such a fool!
I'm alone now, but it's better for me
I don't need all your negativity

I could be a pretty girl, I'll wear a skirt for you
I could be a pretty girl, shut up when you want me too
I could be a pretty girl, won't ever make you blue
I could be a pretty girl, I'll lose myself in you
