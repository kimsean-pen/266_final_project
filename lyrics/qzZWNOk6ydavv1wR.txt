Found there
Floor of North Sea
Spiral arm creature ten times long
Rocky shore, sinking sand
Deep green sea fiend
Long-scale wings arch back
Passing by on my right
Burning eyes, standing wave

Standing wave, so in phase

Hot breeze (found me)
Standing (breathing)
Super (nova)
Says my name (says my name)
Solar (creature)
In your skin (human shape)
Bare on feet (melting sand)
Glimpse of emerging mind

Standing wave, so in phase

I saw your shape (Where was I?)
On my right (I'm on all sides)
I know your face (Know my mind)
Mind in space? (You got it)

I saw your shape (Where was I?)
On my right (I'm on all sides)
I know your face (Know my mind)
Mind in space? (You got it)
