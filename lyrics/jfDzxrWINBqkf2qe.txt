Hey, it's cool, I know, I'll see you around
It ain't like this is the end of our merry-go-round
So we don't need to be dramatic about it, baby
We know that no is another word for maybe
And maybe is another word for come over

'Cause it's all fun and games
It's all poker face
Three a.m., your place
You hold me close like you do your cards
Can't tell the joker from the queen of hearts or the queen of spades
It's all go then stay, every time you call me, hey
It's all fun and it's all games
'Til someone doesn't wanna play, play, ay
Doesn't wanna play, play, ay

We're no good at goodbye and that's why we're stuck in the in-between
'Cause every time I'm fine, I'm not, and you're lonely
And I know you and I lay it all on the table
But a Saturday night doesn't have to be fatal
And who cares, anyway, about a label?

'Cause it's all fun and games
It's all poker face
Three a.m. your place
You hold me close like you do your cards
Can't tell the joker from the queen of hearts or the queen of spades
It's all go then stay, every time you call me, hey
It's all fun and it's all games
'Til someone doesn't wanna play, play, ay
Doesn't wanna play, play, ay

Maybe one day, we'll take this big top down
We'll let the same old circus leave town
But for now

It's all fun and games
It's all poker face
Three a.m, your place
You hold me close like you do your cards
Can't tell the joker from the queen of hearts or the queen of spades
It's all go then stay, every time you call me, hey
It's all fun and it's all games
'Til someone doesn't wanna play, play, ay
Doesn't wanna play, play, ay

Yeah, you think you have the upperhand
'Til you see the other hand
Think you have the upper hand
'Til you see the other hand

Hey, it's cool, I know, I'll see you around
It ain't like this is the end of our merry-go-round
