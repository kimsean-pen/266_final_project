The evangelical counterfeit
Counterfeit
Yes I am the passage
Yes I am the passage
Between you + something
Between you + something
Else.

You can trust in me
Yes you can trust in me
Tell me everything you are afraid of
Everything you have done wrong

Because I am the physical existence
I am the physical existence
I am

There's a wall between us
You will feel free
You will feel free

There's a wall between us
There's a wall
