Only way
Strum my way
Strong copies
I made 'em mad
So annoyed

I'm gonna be my only one
Still can't bring my homie back
Sunken away
Running away

Beat the pot like potiful
Pay the puss like melodic
Pussy wet like its nautical
I had to take a sabbatical

Only way
Drop my way
Still can't bring my homie back
Sunking away
Running away

I just came up on on Andromeda
Spend your bitch like its Hanukkah
Kiss the pack like Bey
Wash it out like I'm part of it
Curse the ocean like moniker
I put the back in the yamulka
Fetty, Fellini, Patenica
I just pulled up at the Vatican
Puffy hair, puffy pockets
Twenty picks in my locket
Wrist measured like a Beemer Lake
I been serving up similac
These babies need a daddy
These chicken need a coup
I put the buss in a move
I put the stick in a glue

She know me
She know I go low with a lean
Common to me
Niggs ain't got no loyal to a queen
Gone with the beat
Niggs be true like somebody
Common to me
Let's talk about how she in love with the beat
Open to me
Lil' bit look like Oprah to me
Closer to me
Look like Deepak Chopra to me
Closer still
This should write the Motherwell
Something to tell
Three, Four eyes go bump into me

Only way
Strum my way
Strong copies
I made 'em mad
So annoyed

I'm gonna be my only one
Still can't bring my homie back
Sunken away
Running away

Beat the pot like potiful
Pay the puss like melodic
Pussy wet like its nautical
I had to take a sabbatical

Only way
Drop my way
Still can't bring my homie back
Sunking away
Running away

What it baby
What it baby
What it baby

Biddy, biddy, bomb, biddy, biddy all night
Help me take the fire, I tell little baby goodnight
Wake up baby 'cos I gotta get it bro
Gotta get in it yo'
'Cos I get again, oh, oh
Need that biddy 'cos I'm good again, alright
Credits to me 'cause I couldn't be in it bro
Now I'm in Mexico, Just let me fill up in Texaco
Then I'm in Mexical
Penicillin 'cause I'm feeling hoe
Bitch you can get it I'm going up
Half of the boot I'm snorting up
People looking like they knowing us

Feed the great like, oy
Feed the great white, ooh
I need a shoe in the phrase
I need a boot in the grave
I want more trot on the base
I want place in the race
I'm on a fuck with the less
I'm on a coke in the ass yeah

Move to the middle
Not like me play caught like a villain
All in the the middle
Run like we can't walk in a riddle

Caught in the middle
These eight years so hard in the middle
Start with a little
Now these just go on with a riddle

Only way
Strum my way
Strong copies
I made 'em mad
So annoyed

I'm gonna be my only one
Still can't bring my homie back
Sunken away
Running away

Beat the pot like potiful
Pay the puss like melodic
Pussy wet like its nautical
I had to take a sabbatical

Only way
Drop my way
Still can't bring my homie back
Sunking away
Running away

Getting out by the grace of God!
