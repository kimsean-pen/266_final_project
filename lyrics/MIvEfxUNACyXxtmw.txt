Turn down the lights, turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me, tell me no lies
Just hold me close, don't patronize
Don't patronize me

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something that it won't
Here in the dark, these final hours
I will lay down my heart, and I feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
And I can't make you love me
If you don't

I'll close my eyes, then I won't see
The love you do not feel, when you're holdin' me
Mornin' will come, and I'll do what's right
Just give me till then, to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

And I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel, something it didn't want
And here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart, I feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
And I can't make you love me
If you don't

Ain't no use in you tryin'
It's no good for me baby without love
All my tears, all these years, everything I believed in
Baby
Oh yeah
Someone's gonna love me
