You are an angel
that money couldn't buy
You are an angel
Oh lord don't ask why
You are a lover
seductive from the start
You are a lover
that mends my broken heart
And when you bang your gong
I will surely run to you
My angel, my angel, my angel yeah!

You are an angel
a messenger of peace
You are the beauty
that soothes the savage beast
You are a lover
seductive from the start
You are a lover
that mends my broken heart
And when you bang your gong
I will surely run to you
My angel, my angel, my angel yeah!
My angel, my angel, my angel yeah!

And when you bang your gong
I will surely run to you
My angel, my angel, my angel yeah!
My angel, my angel, my angel yeah!
My angel, my angel, my angel yeah!
My angel, my angel, my angel yeah!
