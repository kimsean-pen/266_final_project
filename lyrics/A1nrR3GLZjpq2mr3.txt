How many rings
Until I pick up?
No rings
Don't bother
No rings
I won't answer
And I don't buy rings

Those are the best ways I know to be alone
Forever
Those are the best ways I know to be alone
I'm tired of changing
I'm tired of staying the same

Don't bother
I won't answer
I'm tired of changing
I'm tired of staying the same

How many rings
Until I pick up?
No rings
I don't buy rings
