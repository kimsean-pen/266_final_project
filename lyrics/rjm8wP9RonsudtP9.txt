Well, you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes and throw them on the floor
Dance in the kitchen till morning light
Louisiana Saturday night

Waiting in the front yard sitting on a log
A single-shot rifle and a one-eyed dog
Yonder come the kin folk in the moonlight
Louisiana Saturday night

Well, you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes and throw them on the floor
Dance in the kitchen till morning light
Louisiana Saturday night

My brother Bill and my other brother Jack
Belly full of beer and a possum in a sack
Fifteen kids in the front porch light
Louisiana Saturday night

When the kin folks leave and the kids get fed
Me and my woman gonna slip off to bed
Have a little fun when we turn out the light
Louisiana Saturday night

Well, you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes and throw them on the floor
Dance in the kitchen till morning light
Louisiana Saturday night

Yeah, you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes and throw them on the floor
Dance in the kitchen till morning light
Louisiana Saturday night

You get down the fiddle and you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes and throw them on the floor
Dance in the kitchen till morning light
Louisiana Saturday night
