I'll marry my lover in a place to admire
I don't have to even ask her, I can look in her eyes
And thank God that I am forgiven
Or thank all of my friends to say I've been true or they've forgotten

And weary my mind is, to say the least
It's been awful hard to just stand on my feet
I think I'll slow down if I am able
I won't drown in the ocean or starve at my place at the table

Lucky ones are we all 'till it is over
Everyone near and far
When you smile the sun, it peeks through the clouds
Never die, for always be around and around and around

And how is your sister and what of your brother?
Extend hellos to your father and mother
What in the world would cause you any sorrow?
Lighten your load and see how I killed the wheelbarrow I borrowed

Lucky ones are we all 'till it is over
Everyone near and far
When you smile the sun, it peeks through the clouds
Never die, for always be around and around and around
