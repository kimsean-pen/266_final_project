This don't work out in time
and I can't control your mind
as I question the things left behind
in many hits
And I could barely hold my hand
doing -
the simple...

Well I always say tomorrow
'cause everything's too hard to fix right now
but you couldn't wait that long
I miss you

So what's going on in your head?
And who's been - your bed?
Well I know I'm being insane
and I don't need to blame

And I could barely hold my hand
doing -, the simple...

Well I always say tomorrow
'cause everything's too hard to fix right now
but you couldn't wait that long

But you only tell me to wait
and talk like they're coming on daze
as you push all the felling away
in many hits, my conscience

Well I always say tomorrow
'cause everything's too hard to fix right now
but you couldn't wait that long
I miss you

Well I always say tomorrow
'cause everything's too hard to fix right now
but you couldn't wait that long
I miss you
