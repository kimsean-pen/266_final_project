Just this once, I will go to the front.
I will let you all disagree!
You won't last, all you've got is the past.
And an overnight shotgun that fucked up the dream
No excuses and no surprise.
The real McCoy is a look in your eyes!
I don't rate, they can alienate this American selfish everything!

We're the breakdown, I will break ground, on original sin!
Suddenly I'm on the right side, in the middle of nowhere again!
I am in your hands – I don't mind – 'cause I don't understand
I am in your hands – I want you all to tell me who I am!
Just tell me who I am!
Just tell me who I...

Just in case, it's an arrogant fate.
'cause I know you all wanna see!
Here's a test and you're a dire bet.
No one feels like you and screams like me! (yeah)
All confusion and all control.
The real McCoy isn't real anymore!
I'm amazed at the innocent taste of America's selfish everything!

We're the breakdown, I will break ground, on original sin!
Suddenly I'm on the wrong side, in the middle of nowhere again!
I am in your hands – I don't mind – 'cause I don't understand
I am in your hands – I want you all to tell me who I am!
Just tell me who I am!
Just tell me who I am!

Somebody Tell ME!

I am in your hands – I don't mind – I don't understand
I am in your hands – I don't mind – I don't mind!
Oh, I am in your hands and I don't mind 'cause I don't understand
I am in your hands – I want you all to tell me who I am!
Just tell me who I am! (tell me who I am)
Just tell me who I am!
Just tell me who I am! (tell me who I am)

Tell me who I am!
