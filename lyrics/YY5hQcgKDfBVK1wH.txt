Away, the joker's closin' in
Reform and they will win
The light is fading fast
I know, you know, they know, we all know
Everybody's gonna burn down

The girls come crawlin' on all fours
Bangin' on locked doors
High cards call the tune
I know, you know, they know, we all know
Everybody's gonna burn down

Play me another hand
Loose everything I am
Until we meet again

The ace that's hidin' up your sleeve
Will cause the world to grieve
The love you had is gone
I know you know, they know, we all know

The dream in every player's heart
To win it all, not part
They lie awake at night
I know, you know, they know, we all know

The game where gamblers rule the night
And get your blood they might
The joker's closin' in
I know, you know, they know, we all know
