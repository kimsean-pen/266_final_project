Let's admit
We don't have much time
One more chance
Until we stop tryin'

Look at me
See the fear in my eyes
It's too soon
But i'm afraid this is good bye

Don't want us to part
But we'll just have to
And hope for a new start

We'll leave it all behind
For a new beginning would do anything to
Be by your side
We'll leave it all behind
For a new beginning
I would do anything
To see you again
Don't let it be goodbye

Time stands still
When i know
I can't reach you

Don't want us to part
But we'll just have to
And hope for a new start

We'll leave it all behind
For a new beginning
I would do anything
To be by your side
We'll leave it all behind
For a new beginning
I would do anything
To see you again
Don't let it be goodbye
