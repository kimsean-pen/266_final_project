From way far across the sea
Came an Eritrean maiden she
Had a one track mind and eyes funny
Half blinded in a war

With a pale young Anglican
Who said he'd help her all he can
Showed her Jesus and his little unholy friend
She had no notion to please him
Just say ta ra and leave him behind

A little boy in a stairwell who says
"I hate people like you"
I got match sticks and cable TV
Half of less than fifty p
We all clambered over the balcony
Bangin' on the window waking Steve
Bringing with a true love his unholy friend
Singin',"If you really need it
You just won't leave it behind"

So baby please kill me
Oh baby don't kill me
But don't bring that ghost 'round to my door
I don't wanna see him anymore

Please kill me
Oh baby don't kill me
Just don't bang on about yesterday
You know, I wouldn't know about that anyway

I'll go
Monkey said to the mouse before
If she loved anybody more than he
It turns you into stone
No I'm reversing down the lonely street
Cheap hotel where I can meet the past
And pay it off and keep it sweet
This is sweet like nothing no

It's just like nothing at all
And I've seen you there
How could I help but stare?
It rips the heart out off your baby
Taken far too much to see
Or think or touch what's real
Stranded on this street that
Paved my only way home

You really need it oh
You just won't leave it behind
Oh please kill me
Oh no don't kill me

Don't let those sun see my no
I don't wanna see him anymore
Please kill me
Oh no don't kill me
Don't go on about yesterday
You know, I wouldn't know about that anyway
Oh no
Aa ahh
Aaa aa aa
Aa ahh
He got nothin' no
He got nothin' at all
