Suddenly... life has new meaning
Suddenly... feeling is being

And you shine inside
And love stills my mind like the sunrise
Dreaming light of the sunrise

Suddenly, I don't have to be afraid
Suddenly, it all falls into place

And you shine inside
And love stills my mind like the sunrise
Dreaming light of the sunrise
Dreaming light and...

I feel you but I don't really know you
I've seen of you from the moment I saw you
And I've seen the sunrise in your eyes
The sky... the sea... the light

So live and dream beneath the northern horizon
Be at peace, set your heart and fly again
The light is truth...
The light is you...
