Hi, hi, alright, hey, alright
Why ya been running your mouth?
All loud, and wide and free as this island
When I don't mention ya, and I heard way of word
When I was in New York (New York, New York)
I, I, I, I know ya might like, to be up in her world
Would ya, smile and wave when you sight her?
And try to say hello, tell me you mean no harm
Let's ride and let's go under...

Yo, you know I spit slick game, slick game to the brothers
When I hip-pop slang, bang-bang for the summer
I'm the twist, - slick dame they say you the son of
So they nick-nick, name-named me ya mother
If the fifth pop, -prey, pray for ya butter...
You in tip top shape? Shift-shape, nigga run it...
Little sis skate- straight, straight to the coven
Little witch pop, - Jupiter Queen
Ya bitch make hits, never do it for free...
I can't take that risk, never 2 out of 3
I took the blue out the sea, and put the blue in the weave
I did the 'bam dance nigga, then it blew in the breeze
And word to you and to me, I get the blue and the cheese
If you a big shot nigga, I'ma sue ya, believe
I spit the truth and believe I'll hit ya tooth with the niñ -
Little witch pot, nigga nigga who could it be?

(PUMP)
