Breathe, trust, bless me and release
Climb, hard, or never be seen
Closed off, rescue to breathe
Just bless me
Two sided time
Your rebirth can't hurt
Branch out behind
The pain

Closure has come to me myself
You will never belong to me
Closure has come to me myself
You will never belong to me

Had to turn, lay down
You're the sting of disease
Phase you out, should've seen this coming
Go on, confusing this soul
Hold my breath 'til you rupture
Three days aside
Your rebirth can't hurt
Branch out behind
Pride

Closure has come to me myself
You will never belong to me
Closure has come to me myself
You will never belong to me

Like a leach, I hold on as if we belonged
To some precious pure dream
Cast off you've seen what's beneath
Now fail me
Forget closure
Forget closure
Forget closure
Forget closure

Closure has come to me myself
You will never belong to me (no)
Closure has come to me myself
You will never belong to me (so breathe)
