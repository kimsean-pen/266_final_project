Guess I'm stuck in a dream
Surrounded by coloured leaves on the ground
As I stare at the trees
I see one fall down on my hand
As I start to explore
I can't ignore a man
He turns his head around
His face was all worn by the sun

I'm going out for a while
So I can get high with my friends
I will
I'm going out for a while
Don't wait up cause I won't be home
Today

Drifting down a road
Losing myself in a dream
Feel my hands getting cold
Sat in a boat on a lake

I'm going out for a while
So I can get high with my friends
I will
I'm going out for a while
Don't wait up cause I won't be home
Today

Climbing up trying my best
As I sink
Climbing up trying my best
As I sink again

Lying back on the floor
Reaching up high into space
See myself in a glass
I'm counting the lines on my face
Again
I'm counting the lines on my face
Again

I'm going out for a while
So I can get high with my friends
I will
I'm going out for a while
Don't wait up cause I won't be home
Today

I'm going out for a while
So I can get high with my friends
I will
I'm going out for a while
Don't wait up cause I won't be home
Today

Today, Today, Today, Today,
Today...
