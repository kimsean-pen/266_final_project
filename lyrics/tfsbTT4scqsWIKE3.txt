I've been fighting for so long
In the shade is my home
And I've been killing with a right or wrong
Between two sides I'm trone and don't
And a car that has left me alone
I am no one and I'll die alone

Don't try to find me
Don't worry where I am
Or you will wind up another wanted man
Wanted man
You'll be a wanted man
You will run
And you'll die a wanted man

The road behind has disappeared
Drowned in the memories of your tears
In the shadow but it's still too near
No one to trust or choose to speak
I am the end and that I fear
Lord forgive me when the smoke clears

Don't try to find me
Don't worry where I am
Or you will wind up another wanted man
Wanted man
You'll be a wanted man
You will run
And you'll die a wanted man

Wanted man
You'll be a wanted man
You will run
And you'll die a wanted man

Don't try to find me
Don't worry where I am
Or you will wind up another wanted man
Wanted man
You'll be a wanted man
You will run
And you'll die a wanted man

Wanted man
You'll be a wanted man
You will run
And you'll die a wanted man

Wanted man
You'll be a wanted man
You will run
And you'll die a wanted man

I've been fighting for so long
In the shade is my home
And I've been killing with a right or wrong
