(Time after time, you bring me up when I'm down)
(Time after time, you bring me up when I'm down)

Do you understand
Just how much I feel for you, do you
Do you comprehend
When I say my love is true, do you

Always - with me - forever, oh baby
I know - we'll be - together

I tell you time after time
You bring me up when I'm down
I'm telling you, time after time
I don't wanna lose what I've found
Real love, I still believe in love
Real love, I still believe in love

Do you realize
Just how much you mean to me
If I close my eyes
You're the only one I see

Oooh

Always - with me - forever, oh baby
I know - we'll be - together
I tell you time after time
You bring me up when I'm down
I'm telling you, time after time
I don't wanna lose what I've found
Real love, I still believe in love
Real love, I still believe in love

Time after time, time after time
Real love, I still believe in love
And time after time, time after time
Real love, I still believe in real love

I tell you time after time
You bring me up when I'm down
I'm telling you time after time
I don't wanna lose what I've found

Real love, I still believe in love
Real love, I still believe in love

Real love

Time after time

Real love

Time after time

Real love
