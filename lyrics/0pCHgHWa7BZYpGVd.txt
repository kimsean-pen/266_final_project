Save my life, woah
Do you feel like a tear-drop in the ocean?
Can you feel the dark force in the air?
Is it hard when you get up, to get back in the moment?
and you're not moving anywhere
Do they tell you dreams slowly surrender?
To what is easy and in front of your face
if you're scared you're going down, and you're never getting out
then this is what you gotta say.

Saving my life

Are you stuck in a rat race that you won't win?
Are you scared that you'll never wake up?
Will they make you punch in, when you're there in the morning
and punch you when they've had enough?
There's a life and it's out there for the taking
You can run and you can leave this behind
They'll tell you it's a trap, and they caught you in the act
ain't nothing but a state of mind.

I SAY
