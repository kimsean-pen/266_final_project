No more blame, I am destined to keep you sane.
Gotta rescue the flame,
Gotta rescue the flame in your heart.

No more blood, I will be there for you, my love.
I will stand by your side,
The world has forsaken my girl.

Should I've seen it would be this way.
Should I've known from the start what she's up to.
When you've loved and you've lost someone
You know what it feels like to lose.

She's fading away, away from this world.
Drifting like a feather, she's not like the other girls.
She lives in the clouds and talks to the birds.
Hopeless little one she's not like the other girls I know.

No more shame, she has felt too much pain in her life.
In her mind she's repeating the words,
All the love you put out will return to you.

Should have seen it would be this way.
Should have known from the start what she's up to.
When you loved and you've lost someone close to you
You know what it feels like to lose.

(background voice:)
You know what it feels like to lose.

She's fading away, away from this world.
Drifting like a feather she's not like the other girls.
She lives in the clouds and talks to the birds.
Hopeless little one she's not like the other girls I know.
She's fading away, away from this world.
Drifting like a feather she's not like the other girls.
She lives in the clouds and talks to the birds.
Hopeless little one she's not like the other girls I know.
