Cherish
Two circular views of blue with a grey shade

So captivating
More than you know.

False perceptions
That brought forth these questions of

Truth, love and hope.
Now that you're injuring
I carry you with me just

Please hold on.
Dissapear and dissolve
A weakening wall

Will one day fall.
It's wise to sever our loss

A redefined pulse

Through your iris.
Love's not all lost

But it's nailed to my cross
And crucified all that I've held on
To be awaiting
Anticipating a touch such as yours.
False affection
A spawn of neglection
Of love, lust, hoax.
Please understand me
That now where you're standing
Is closer than I'd hoped.
Dissapear and dissolve
A weakening wall
Will one day fall.
It's wise to sever our loss
A redefined pulse
Through your iris.
Your iris...
Your iris...
Dissapear and dissolve
A weakening wall
Will one day fall.
It's wise to sever our loss
A redefined pulse
Through your iris.
Dissapear and dissolve
A weakening wall
Will one day fall
It's wise to sever our loss
A redefined pulse
A new iris.
