Down in Jamaica, they got lots of pretty women
Steal your money then they break your heart
Lonesome Sue, she's in love with old Sam
Take him from the fire into the frying pan

On and on
She just keeps on trying
And she smiles
When she feels like crying
On and on, on and on, on and on

Poor ol' Jimmy sits alone in the moonlight
He saw his woman kiss another man
So he takes a ladder, steals the stars from the sky
Puts on Sinatra and starts to cry

On and on
He just keeps on trying
And he smiles
When he feels like crying
On and on, on and on, on and on

When the first time is the last time
It can make you feel so bad
But if you know it, show it
Hold on tight, don't let her say, "Goodnight"

I got the sun on my shoulders and my toes in the sand
My woman's left me for some other man
But I don't care, I'll just dream and stay tan
Toss up my heart to see where it lands

On and on
I just keep on trying
And I smile
When I feel like dying
On and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on, on and on
