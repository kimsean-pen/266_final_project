Holding on to things I had
I bottle up inside
Wanna face my demons
But denial makes me high
Thought I had it figured out
I guess it was a lie
Thought I was a grown-up
But I'm really just a child

Looking back on things I had
I ruin everything
Everything's my fault
And it's the bad luck that I bring
My idea of forever is fleeting in itself
Everyone I love has an expiration shelf
Everyone I love leaves me when I need them most
My little heart is broken
And the world will pay the cost

Smash my heart in pieces (smash my heart in pieces)
It looks so good on the floor (it looks good on the floor)
Now I really hate you (you know I hate you)
And I wanna hate you more (you know I hate you more)
I will climb a mile for you (I would climb a mile)
In fact I always did (you know I always did)
You gave me a fraction of what (gave me a fraction)
I had to give (what I had to give)

My eyes are bleeding
I'm sick and still not eating
Got nothing to believe in
I'm not so lucky
I thought you'd love me
I thought you'd love me
I thought you'd love me
I thought you'd love me
