Where did it go?
The love that we shared, guess we'll never know
Is it hidden behind that velvet rope?
While I'm standing alone
Out in the cold

Where did you go?
Do your new friends know, that it's all for show?
Or did you fool them all, into thinking you're gold?
Did you do as you're told?
Will it ever get old?

Don't you remember me, darling?
When you lay down to sleep, do you still think of me?
'Cause I remember you, darling
Without the sadness in your eyes
Now the champagne's running dry

I heard that you've been living it up, living it up
Where did I go wrong?
Only yesterday, you were beside me, -side me
Now I'm just another one
You're the one who's giving it up, giving it up
Singing that same song
You're the only one I want beside me, -side me
Now I'm just another one
Singing that same song

You were so high
I bet you felt you could touch the sky
Now you reach the top, was it worth the climb?
Oh, what did you find?
Would you leave it behind?

If I were to say
That since you've been gone, it isn't the same
That maybe I'm wrong and I've made a mistake
By letting you go
So far away

Don't you remember me, darling?
When you lay down to sleep, do you still think of me?
'Cause I remember you, darling
Without the sadness in your eyes
Now the champagne's running dry (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

I heard that you've been living it up, living it up
Where did I go wrong?
Only yesterday, you were beside me, -side me
Now I'm just another one
You're the one who's giving it up, giving it up
Singing that same song
You're the only one I want beside me, -side me
Now I'm just another one (Ooh)
Singing that same song (Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah)
Now I'm just another one (Come on, ooh)
Clap with me now
Singing that same song (Ooh, ooh)
You're the only one I want beside me, -side me
Now I'm just another one
I heard that you've been living it up, living it up (Oh, no)
Where did I go wrong? (Yeah, yeah)
Only yesterday, you were beside me, -side me
Now I'm just another one (You know that I know, yeah, yeah)
Giving it up (Oh, no)
Singing that same song (You're the only one I want beside me, -side me)
Now I'm just another one (Oh)
