I will wait until the end
When the pendulum will swing back to the
Darker side of our hearts bleeding
I will save this empty space
Next to me like it's a grave
Where I lay a place for us to sleep eternally together

I have been searching for traces of what we were

A ghost of you is all that I have left
It's all that I have left of you to hold
I wake in the night to find there's no one there but me
And nothing left of what we were at all

So here I am
Pacing around this house again
With pictures of us living on these walls
I see my breath in the cold of the air
That I breathe and I'm wondering
I'm wondering if it's you that I feel
If it's you that I feel here haunting me forever

I have been searching for traces of what we were

A ghost of you is all that I have left
It's all that I have left of you to hold
I wake in the night to find there's no one there but me
And nothing left of what we were at all

And I'm not looking for anything but us
Anything but what we were
And I'm not asking for painted memories
I only want to know you're here

A ghost of you is all that I have left
It's all that I have left of you to hold
I wake in the night to find there's no one there but me
And nothing left of what we were at all
A ghost of you is all that I have left
It's all that I have left of you to hold
I wake in the night to find there's no one there but me
And nothing left of what we were at all
