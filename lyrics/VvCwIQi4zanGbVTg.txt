I made a wreck of my hand
I put it through the wall
I made a fist and not a plan
Call me a reckless wrecking ball

I throw my plates against the wall
And give it all I got
I aim to break not one but all
I'm just a big ol' wrecking ball

I am unruly in the stands
I am a rock on top of the sand
I am a fist amidst the hands
And I break it
Just because I can

It takes a dedicated hand
To put it through the wall
You gotta wanna break the heart
Of all those pretty porcelain dolls
You gotta want to be the drummer in the band
You gotta want to be a battering ram
You gotta see the artistry
In tearing the place apart with me baby

I am unruly in the stands
I am a rock on top of the sand
I am a fist amidst the hands
And I break it
Just because I can

Let's break it
(just because we can)
Deface it
(just because we can)
Let's break it
just because
just because
just because
just because

I am unruly in the stands
(I am a rock on top of the sand)
I am a fist amidst the hands
And I make a wreck out of my hand
I make a fist and not a plan
And I break it
just because I can

because I can
because I can
because I can
because I can
because I can
because I can
because I can
because I can
