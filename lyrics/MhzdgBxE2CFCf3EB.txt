time isnt on my side
any more than you
and thats the only thing
near this half-baked truth

I can tell you whats wrong
with this picture I took
dont remember where
I centered myself

waiting for the dusty shelf
to get wiped down
practicing my lines
with a personal shine

and now we'll doubt well try
to celebrate an expiration past its prime
stretching out the time will be fine
someone break it down, we'll be fine

time isnt on my side
any more than you
and thats the only thing
near this half-baked truth

and now we'll give it a rest
knowing thats its you who can say it best
show me what you feel abt yr mess
say fortunately I am impressed
