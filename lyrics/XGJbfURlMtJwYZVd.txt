You don't understand me
But if the feeling was right
You might comprehend me
And why do you feel the need to tease me?
Why don't you turn it around?
It might be easier to please me

And there's always another point of view
A better way to do the things we do
And how can you know me and I know you
If nothing is true?

What do you think that you are doing? (Ooh...)
Who is the fool, the fool
Or the fool that you are fooling? (Fool that you are fooling)
And maybe I just don't see the reason (reason)
But in the court of my heart
Your ignorance is treason

And there's always another point of view
A better way to do the things we do
And how can you know me and I know you
If nothing is true?

You think you know how I feel
It's not that big of a deal
There's no such thing, it's not real
Oh...

You don't understand me
But if the feeling was right
You might comprehend me
And I don't claim to understand you (oooh...)
But I've been looking around
And I haven't found anybody like you

And there's always another point of view
A better way to do the things we do
And how can you know me and I know you
If nothing is true?
