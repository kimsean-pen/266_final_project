Jumping off the water's edge
Swimming with my ignorance
No matter how deep, no matter how deep

Sinking with mistakes I make
Drown and then procrastinate
We used to be free, from what we now need

Where were you when I was young?
When nothing ever could go wrong
Suddenly you come along
Where were you when I was young?

Spark me up and come alive
Burn me to the core and lie
No matter how deep, no matter how deep

Get my hit and take your drug
Like I didn't know the pain there was
And as I fall free, the time will catch me

Where were you when I was young?
When nothing ever could go wrong
Suddenly you come along
Where were you when I was young?

We wanted a promise to hold
To keep down deep in the well
Appearing was hearing the echo
And now free to hear myself
When I was starry-eyed falling back in time and back in place
Back we're turning face to face
Spin me out clean
Where you found me
Where were you when I was young?
When nothing ever could go wrong
Suddenly you come along
Where were you when I was young?
