Shooting star, what is your hurry?
So fast, so far, are you burning or glowing?
Running to something or running away?
Is this your reality every day? You're a

Shooting star, what is your hurry?
As for me, oh oh

Oh, I'm gonna follow the sun
Oh, I'm gonna follow the rainbows
Come and they go, so
I'm gonna follow the sun

Shooting star, what is your hurry?
So fast, so far, are you spinning or turning?
Did you fall from Heaven or fall out of grace?
Somewhere there's a
Perfect place in space for you

Shooting star what is your hurry
As for me, oh oh

Oh, I'm gonna follow the sun
Oh, I'm gonna follow the rainbows
Come and they go, so
I'm gonna follow

The stars and the pain and the
Obstacles and the strange
Monsters that live in my head
They tell me that I am not worthy
I know that I am

Oh, I'm gonna follow the sun
Oh, I'm gonna follow the rainbows
Come and they go, so
I'm gonna follow the sun
Oh, I'm gonna follow the sun
Oh, I'm gonna follow the rainbows
Come and they go, so
I'm gonna follow (I'm gonna follow the sun)
And I'm gonna follow
And I'm gonna follow

Shooting star, what is your hurry?
