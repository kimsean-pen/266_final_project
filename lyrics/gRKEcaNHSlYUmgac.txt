Evolve from beasts, yet beasts we are
A Trial of will, to force restrain
All the rage, locked inside
Struggle on in human form

Hate overflows
It crawls its way, beneath our skin
Its curse is strong, enslaves our thoughts
Ignore the signs, unlock its fury
Feel its power, indulge its tough

Hate overflows
This violent, primal rage

A rage inside the soul now burns
Reach the point of no return
Internal fire that sears the flesh
Melt away my human form

Pure poison, potent and true
Silencing the voice of reason
On the edge, fighting for balance
I plunge into my darkest depths
The anger and menace, of this burdened soul
Breaks the surface, free and wild
Becoming the beast, to kill the fear
Warped and twisted, vicious and savage

A rage inside the soul now burns
Reach the point of no return
Might fires that sear the flesh
Melt away our human form
