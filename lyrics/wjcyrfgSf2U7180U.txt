Shut your doors their storm is coming
Of unlived dreams that were cast away
Hear the howls soaring in the wind
Don't let our end begin
My hatred grows as their tears fall
Shield innocence from hungry tombs
Keep damages from taking you
Hear the howls soaring in the wind
Don't let our end begin
My hatred grows as their tears fall
I'll do anything that I can do
To lock the window beasts are climbing through
My hatred grows as their tears fall
Extinguish our own hells
