You know she's never gonna tell you
If she likes it this way
You know she's never gonna ask you
If you feel the same

A fever oh an addiction
Was it worth it?
Did you give you life away?
A fever a desperate religion
And all that she can say is

...give me just a little bit... uh
gimme just a little bit...
...give me just a little bit... uh
gimme just a little bit...

A train that never stops rolling
It's getting into your blood
A need that never stops growing
She's a posionous one
A hope for better days but nothing oh
Seems to fix it... uh
Now you're wasting away
Indeed a desperate religion
And all that she will say is

...give me just a little bit... uh
gimme just a little bit...
...give me just a little bit... uh
gimme just a little bit...

...give me just a little bit... uh
gimme just a little bit...
