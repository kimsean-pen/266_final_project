I've never held so tight
Feels like the first time that I ever drove alone
Leaving for a holiday, wishin' that I could've stayed
In the comfort of my home
If you want it, I have it
I'll do it, just ask you
I've never been steady
You knowOh, oh, oh, oh
If you wanted me to stay around
I could, I said
Oh, oh, oh, oh
If you really wanna settle down
I would
(You know I would)
Dreaming from a past life
Feels like the first time that we were talked to
Tell me and I'll stick around
Settle in a ghost town just to call a place my own
I don't know what to do, I think I might be in love with you
I don't know what to do, I think I might be in love with you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
If you wanted me to stay around
I could, I said
Oh, oh, oh, oh
If you really wanna settle down
I would
(You know I would)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
If you want me to stay around
I could, I said
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm not asking you to settle down
But I would
(You know I would)
