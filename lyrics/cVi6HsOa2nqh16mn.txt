Listen to your heart (Listen to your heart)
Tell him that you love him
Listen to your heart (Listen to your heart)
Tell him that you love him

Already anticipating
(That he just won't care)
You gettin' tired of the waitin' yeah yeah
(Does he know you're there)
Oh oh

Palms get sweaty
Seein' his face in the crowd
Stomach flutters
When he says your name out loud

Your heart's tryna tell you
What you already know
And sometimes you can't take it slow
(Listen to your heart)
You gotta listen to your heart, baby

Tell him that you love him
(You know it might seem crazy but)
Listen to your heart
Tell him that you love him

(Is it the rush)
That you feelin' when he
Brushes your hand
(You feel the touch)
Tongue is tied up and he
Can't understand
(Is it the fact)
That you worried he not feelin' the same
(No turnin' back)
All the while you adding fuel to the flame
(The time is up)
If you don't risk it you won't know if it's real
(Just try your luck)
Now or never got to say what you feel

Because your heart's tryna tell you
What you already know
And sometimes you can't take it slow
(Listen to your heart)
Oh You gotta tell him

Tell him that you love him
(Don't be scared now baby)
Listen to your heart (Listen to your heart)
Tell him that you love him
Ooh-hoo

Palms get sweaty
Seein' his face in the crowd
Stomach flutters
When he says your name out loud

Your heart's tryna tell you
What you already know
And sometimes you can't take it slow
(Listen to your heart)
You gotta tell him

(Baby)
Tell him that you love him
(You know it might seem crazy but)
Listen to your heart (Listen to your heart)
Tell him that you love him

Listen to your heart (Listen to your heart)
Tell him that you love him
