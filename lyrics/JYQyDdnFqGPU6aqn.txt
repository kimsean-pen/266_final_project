I wanna lay my head down now.
I wanna turn the tide somehow.
I wanna lay my head down now.
I wanna turn the tide somehow.

We are the lonely kids falling away from this
Tedious swarm of bliss inside.
We're in a ruby pool left with a kingdom rule.
Shiny without a jewel in life.

I wanna lay my head down now.
I wanna turn the tide somehow.
I wanna peel my face in doubt.
I wanna wrap my arms around you.
