So you see I've gotten this far.
Please give me some place to hide.
I'm not trying to go there so take me away.
Life sometimes pisses me off.
It's never a good trip for me.
Every time I reach for love, it's taken away.

Night, so I play!
Give me a sign!
This is gay!
Give me some patience so I pray!
It's time to die!
Is that what I want?

There's nothing wrong wanting to be loved.
Is there something wrong with me?
For once in my life I'd like to be really set free.
Let me be me.

Night, so I play!
Give me a sign!
This is gay!
Give me some guidance so I pray!
It's time to die,!
S that what I want?

Take me away.
Take me away.
Take me away.
Taken away.

Night, so I play!
Give me a sign!
This is gay!
Give me some patience so I pray!
It's time to die!
Is that what I want?
Night, so I play!
Give me a sign!
