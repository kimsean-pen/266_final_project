Hey little Danny, don't you cry
I am you from much later in your life
I know your hair is wild, I know you have no style
You're still a virgin and you will be for a while

Danny, don't you know that you are hot as fuck on the inside?
Everybody knows the best bananas will be ripe with time
Danny, don't you know that you kick so much ass on the inside?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?

Hey little Danny, don't be blue
You had a growth spurt and you're suddenly 6'2"
The girls are steering clear, you walk like a newborn deer
You sent birthday invites, and now all your friend is here

Danny, don't you know that you are cool as fuck on the inside?
You're just going through an awkward phase from 12 to 29
Danny, don't you know that everyone feels weird on the inside?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?

Close your eyes and you will see
A window into your destiny
Now you're on tour, and they want more!

You step on stage and they come alive
No one cares that you're 35
You're a rock star, on a centaur!
(Where'd he get a centaur?)

You're still a nerdy kid inside
But now you've finally found your tribe
Hear the crowd roar!
Give 'em what they came for!

All right, let me hear you!
D-A-N-N-Y, he's a super awesome guy!
D-A-N-N-Y, he is not afraid to cry! (What?)
D-A-N-N-Y, he cries almost all the time! (Uh...)
D-A-N-N-Y, he cries and cries and cries and cries!
(Okay, thanks guys! Very helpful,
thank you. Shake it off, shake it off...)

Danny, don't you know that we're all rad as fuck on the inside?
Now it's time to rock the show, come on you are a star tonight
Danny, don't you know that you're a spandex butterfly for life
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?

Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know...
