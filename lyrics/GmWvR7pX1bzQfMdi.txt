You look hurt, but it's not my fault
We're wasting time, that's for the birds
I feel cheated somehow
I feel stifled down here
No one here understands me
I feel cheated somehow
It's not my fault

You look sad, waiting for the train
The sun comes down in the rain
You look cracked, with your mirror-broken face
I feel down, seeing you so low
(but it's getting late)
Baby i've got to go

I feel cheated somehow
I feel stifled down here
No one here understands me
I feel cheated somehow
It's not my fault

You get home, you're bleeding for a light
But now it's closed, the only door in sight
