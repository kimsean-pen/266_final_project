You got a busted heart, you got a broken dream
Somebody tore it all apart on a rainy day
They didn't leave no note, they didn't leave no trace
Just a look at your phone and a look on your face

Well don't give up, love is gonna find you
You can feel it in your gut, it's there to remind you
Nothing good comes without a little pain

You got a brand new start, you got a real good heart
You gotta smile, give it a while, it's gonna be okay
You're not the only one looking 'round lookin' for someone
You gotta trust love, love is on the way

You could've never known, how the dice are gonna roll
Still you got a little mo', a little fight

You gotta dance with the truth, while you wrestle with booze
You gotta wipe those lonely teardrops from your eyes

So don't you give up, love is gonna find you
You can feel it in your gut, it's there to remind you
Nothing good comes without a little pain

You got a brand new start, you got a real good heart
You gotta smile, give it a while, it's gonna be okay
You're not the only one looking 'round lookin' for someone
You gotta trust love, love is on the way

So don't you give up, love is gonna find you
You can feel it in your gut, it's there to remind you
Nothing good comes without a little pain

You got a brand new start, you got a real good heart
You gotta smile, give it a while, it's gonna be okay
You're not the only one looking 'round lookin' for someone
You gotta trust love, love is on the way

You gotta trust love, love is on the way
Love is on the way
