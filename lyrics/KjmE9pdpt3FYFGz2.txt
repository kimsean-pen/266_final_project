Step inside where your true self awaits
Find your will and then you'll find your fate
This room of nightmares, so much to see
This room of nightmares, shall set you free

Set you free
Close your eyes
And you will see

Kill your suffering and drown your fears
Happiness beyond all that's real
This room of nightmares, so much to see
This room of nightmares, shall set you free

Set you free
Close your eyes
And you will see

Set you free
Close your eyes

Set you free
Close your eyes
And you will see
