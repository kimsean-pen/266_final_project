Do I look different?
'Cause I've been feeling kinda different
I've been turning heads all night all eyes on me
I'm being honest, I already know that you want it
But second chances no they don't come around easy

I hope that you know
Everything you didn't know back then
And I hope that it hurts
'Cause I'm dressed up just like revenge

Oh baby, if looks could kill
I think that you'd be dead by now
I think that you'd be six feet under the ground
Just trying to work out how you gave me up
You gave me up
Oh, baby if looks could kill
I'm looking like my best tonight
And it would have you six feet under the ground
Just trying to work out how you got it wrong
If looks could kill you wouldn't last long

I'm on fire, my confidence never been higher
You've been digging your own grave
You made your bed
And do you wish that
You could find a time machine and go back
To the days when you could get inside my head

I hope that you know
Everything you didn't know back then
And I hope that it hurts
'Cause I'm dressed up just like revenge

Oh baby, if looks could kill (ha, ha)
I think that you'd be dead by now (hm, hm)
I think that you'd be six feet under the ground
Just trying to work out how you gave me up
You gave me up (you gave me up)
Oh, baby if looks could kill (if looks could kill)
I'm looking like my best tonight (tonight)
And it would have you six feet under the ground
Just trying to work out how you got it wrong
If looks could kill you wouldn't last long

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I think that you'd be
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And it would have you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I think that you'd be
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
If looks could kill you're gonna die young

Oh baby, if looks could kill
I think that you'd be dead by now
I think that you'd be six feet under the ground
Just trying to work out how you gave me up
You gave me up
Oh, baby if looks could kill (yeah, yeah)
I'm looking like my best tonight (yeah, yeah)
And it would have you six feet under the ground
Just trying to work out how you got it wrong
If looks could kill you wouldn't last long
