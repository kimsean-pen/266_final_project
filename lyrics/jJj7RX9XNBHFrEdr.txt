When I'm with you
I never have a problem when I'm with you
I'm really well adjusted when I'm with you, with you, with you, with you
When I'm with you

When I'm with you
I lose a lot of sleep when I'm with you
I meet a lot of people when I'm with you, with you, with you, with you
When I'm with you

It's the break in the song
When I should say something special
But the pressure is on, and I can't make up nothing special
Not when I'm with you

When I'm with you
I never feel like garbage when I'm with you
I almost feel normal when I'm with you, with you, with you, with you
When I'm with you

When I'm with you
I'm always hot and bothered when I'm with you
I always need a shower when I'm with you, with you, with you, with you
When I'm with you

It's that break in the song
When I should say something special
But the pressure is on and I can't make up nothing special
Not when I'm with you

When I'm with you
I never need a mirror when I'm with you
I don't care what I look like when I'm with you, with you, with you
With you, when I'm with you

When I'm with you, when I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you, with you, with you, with you
When I'm with you

It's the break in the song
When I should say something special
But the pressure is on, and I can't make up nothing special
Not when I'm with you

When I'm with you
I never have a problem when I'm with you
I'm really well adjusted when I'm with you
I lose a lot of sleep when I'm with you

I meet a lot of people when I'm with you
I never feel like garbage when I'm with you
I almost feel normal when I'm with you, with you, with you, with you
When I'm with you

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
