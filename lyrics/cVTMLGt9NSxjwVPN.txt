I'm in war with the world and they try to pull me into the dark
I struggle to find my faith as I'm slipping from your arms
(It's getting harder to stay awake
And my strenght is fading fast
You breathe into me at last)
I'm awake! I'm alive!
Now I know what I believe inside
Now it's my time!
I'll do what I want cause this is my life
Here! (right here!)
Right now! (right know!)
(I stand my ground and never back down)
I know what I believe inside
I'm awake and I'm alive! ...
I'm in war with the world cause I ain't never gonna sell my soul
I already made up my mind
No matter what I can't be bought or sold
(when my faith is getting weak
And I feel like giving in you breath into me again)
I'm awake! I'm alive!
Now I know what I believe inside
Now it's my time
I'll do what I want cause this is my life
Here! (Right Here!)
Right now! (Right now!)
(I stand my ground and never back down)
I know what I believe inside
I'm awake and I'm alive!
Waking up! Waking up!
Waking up! Waking up!
Waking up! Waking up!
Waking up! Waking up!
In the dark, I can feel you in my sleep
In your arms i feel you breath into me
Forever hold this heart that I will give to you
Forever I will live for you! ...
I'm awake! I'm alive!
Now I know what I believe inside
Now it's my time, I'll do what I want cause this is my life
Here! (Right here!)
Right now! (Right now!)
(I'll stand my ground and never back down)
I know what I believe inside
I'm awake and i'm alive!
Waking up! Waking up!
Waking up! Waking up!
Waking up! Waking up!
Waking up! Waking up!
