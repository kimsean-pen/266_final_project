You're like gold dust
It rains over me
A foreign sun that I thought I'd never see
You're like gold dust

Oh don't change ever
No don't change
There's a hollow in this house whenever you go

You're like gold dust
It rains over me
A foreign sun thought I'd never see
You're like gold dust

Keep coming down the street
There's a hollow in this house whenever you go

Keep coming down the street
There's a hollow in this house whenever you go

Keep coming down the street
There's a hollow in this house whenever you go

You're like gold dust
