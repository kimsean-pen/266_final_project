The clans are marching 'gainst the law
Bagpipers play the tunes of war
Death or glory I will find
Rebellion on my mind
The clans are marching 'gainst the law
Bagpipers play the tunes of war
Death or glory I will find
Rebellion on my mind
Rumours know that rebellion will break out
Bonnie Prince Charles is in the highlands to claim his crown no doubt
He raised his Standart at Glenfinnen, calling to our pride
The Jacobites are gathering, I'll be at their side
Armed and ready stand
My rights I must defend
Steel's in my hand
The clans are marching 'gainst the law
Bagpipers play the tunes of war
Death or glory I will find
Rebellion on my mind
The town of Edinburgh fell soon in our hands
Defeated the English at the Battle of Prestopans
Armed and ready stand
My rights I must defend
Steel's in my hand
The clans are marching 'gainst the law
Bagpipers play the tunes of war
Death or glory I will find
Rebellion on my mind
The clans are marching 'gainst the law
Bagpipers play the tunes of war
Death or glory I will find
Rebellion on my mind
The clans are marching
Come play the tunes of war
Death or glory
Rebellion on my mind
