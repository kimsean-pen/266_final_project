I'm feeling lights out, I'm feeling shut down
And when I speak up, nothing wanna come out
I been chained up too
(I been chained up too)
My mind

I'm tryna wake up, and find a new love
And tell the old me that I've had enough
Tryna leave it all
(Tryna leave it all)
Behind

I've been looking for the nightlight switch
I've been feeling like I'm over it
When feelings control me, they ain't gonna hold me back

Love me and let me go
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Love me and let me go
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Love me and let me
Walk away, finally let me breathe
Stop being so obsessed with me
Love me and let me go
Love me and let me go

Let me go, let me go
Let me go now
Let me go, let me go
Let me go now
Let me go, let me go
Let me go now

Thank you for the bad times and the land mines
And them feelings that came like a landslide
Running down my mind
(Running down my mind)
Each night

Thank you for the dark days and the tidal waves
Making real life feel so sideways
Reeling in the wild
(Reeling in the wild)
Wild ride

I've been looking for the nightlight switch
I've been feeling like I'm over it
When feelings control me, they ain't gonna hold me back

Love me and let me go
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Love me and let me go
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Love me and let me
Walk away, finally let me breathe
Stop being so obsessed with me
Love me and let me go
Love me and let me go

Let me go, let me go
Let me go now
Let me go, let me go
Let me go now
Let me go, let me go
Let me go now
