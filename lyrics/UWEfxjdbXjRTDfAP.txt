If you ever see her
Lying hurt
Don't just stare

Please get up, get up, get up
Get up and help her

And then check her pulse and give her air
And then listen and breathe
And keep checkin' and checkin' and checkin' her heart

Don't drive away
Don't leave her this way
Don't drive away
Again

Submitted by Lord Shark

I could never say the things that kept me up
Just lay there listening to you whispering
Maybe it was supposed to help me
Learn to love you more
Help me to notice how we're different, different, different
Alright, alright

Don't drive away
Don't leave her this way
There's not enough hours in our days

Don't drive away
Don't drive away
Don't walk out on her again
Again, again

Don't drive
Oh, oh

Don't drive away
Don't leave her this way
There's not enough hours in our days
Don't drive away
Don't drive away
Don't walk out on her again, again, again, again
Don't drive away
Don't leave her this way
There's not enough hours
There's not enough hours in our days
So don't drive
Don't drive
Don't drive
Don't drive
Away
