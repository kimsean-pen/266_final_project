Lead me back to the place I'm from
Past the farms and debris
You can see it from the highlands
As you roam 'long the range

I've been on the look for a quiet place
It's not far off the range, baby
Take me back to the one I love
It's not far, it's on the way

I've been ramblin'

Burning tires on my street
Past the roar and debris, baby
All the kids dance around it
But he lacks what he sees

I've been drinking up on the sweet tea
It was made just for me

I've been ramblin'
I'm just driftin'

Looking out for the one I love
I've been down by the sea, baby
I've been up in the highlands
Past the farms and debris

I've been rollin' down on the good stuff
Past the roads I can see, oh babe
Lead me back to the one I love
All the roads lead to me

I've been movin'
I'll be driftin'

I could be like a sailor-man
While I wasn't me, I could leave it all
I could toss 'em out like a Wall Street man
While I leave it all, I could leave it all
I could toss 'em out on a one-armed man
While I leave it all, I could leave it all
I could toss 'em out on a one-armed man
While I leave it all, I could leave it all
I could leave it all, I could leave it all
I could leave it all, I could leave it all
I could leave it all
