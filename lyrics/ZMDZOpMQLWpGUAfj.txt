It's lost but we'll find it again
We must try even if it's a distance future
It was all in in our hands to the ends
I just wish we had known so much sooner

It's not over
We'll soon be closer than before
Can't let this distance
Keep our destined souls apart

There's so much I would have shared if I could
But my reaching was not getting through to you
So many times when I was misunderstood
I just wish we had spoken so much sooner

It's not over
We'll soon be closer than before
Can't let this distance
Keep our destined souls apart

We were caught in a swirl of a devious tide
Where I wish I could have guided us through the nocturnal
And I would have ran with you towards the light
Instead I was drawn further and further away

It's not over
We'll soon be closer than before
Can't let this distance
Keep our destined souls apart

It's not over
We'll soon be closer than before
Can't let this distance
Keep our destined souls apart
