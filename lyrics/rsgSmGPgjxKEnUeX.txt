I love to wait,
I love girls with ex- boyfriends that they really aren't over.
And I love new mexico,
I love places I've never been.
I love the idea of places I'll never go.
So I'm swinging like a fist fight concrete colored basement,
Alright alright
Lets keep this clean,
As clean as you like.
And it probably won't get easier,
Just easier to hide.
Prepare for an aching the rest of your life.
I'm playing dead,
I've faked my death.
And I keep pretending if nothing else for the sake of the tradition.
And I am confident (confident)
Even if it makes no sense,
I will say I love you back to the love that I am given.

Alright alright,
Lets keep this clean,
As clean as you like.
And it proably won't get easier,
Just easier to hide.
Prepare for an aching the rest of your life.
Prepare for an aching,
The rest of your life.
