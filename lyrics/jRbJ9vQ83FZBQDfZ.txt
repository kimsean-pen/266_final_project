Summer came on way too strong
And the radio played all new songs
So I smile and hum along
I hum along
Everybody's finally home
For the first time this year, I feel whole
Because I've been so afraid of being alone
So now I'm heading up 309
'Cause I miss this life and I'll set shit right
We're gonna cause some problems here tonight
'Cause Spiro lied about his major then said fuck the whole thing
So he's home to make some bad decisions with me
There's something about weeknights in the suburbs
And there's something about me and all my friends
Kings of awkward situations
The plum blossoms are falling
I'm more than happy going down with them
The casino seemed like a bad idea
But Denny's seemed like a worse one
And I don't think that we'd ever let that stop us
We ended up busted, broken and choking down a Grand Slam
I can't think of a better way for the night to end
'Cause we're this generation's Outsiders
But we've got worse intentions and they've got better haircuts
There's something about weeknights in the suburbs
And there's something about me and all my friends
Kings of awkward situations
The plum blossoms are falling
I'm more than happy going down with them
I'll be in the backyard laughing out by the fire
Saying I'm sick of running away
Maybe I'll stay
We'll be in the backyard causing problems for the neighbors
Screaming we're sick of running away
We'll stay, we'll stay, we'll stay
There's something about weeknights in the suburbs
And there's something about me and all my friends
Kings of awkward situations
The plum blossoms are falling
I'm more than happy going down with them
