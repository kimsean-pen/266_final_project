you can't seperate, what you need and what you want
bad love isn't better than none
you try to simulate it, and you're always holding on
but bad love isn't better than none

so scared of being alone she says when the beast come out at night
and at times it gets so cold
it's so long, that i've been on my own
she says it feels like my whole life and sometimes it gets so old
i tell her try to have some patience good things always seem to come
to the souls who takes it slow
she tells me there's no point of waiting,
she has control

you can't seperate, what you need and what you want
bad love isn't better than none
you try to simulate it, and you're always holding on
but bad love isn't better than none

i watch her as she trys to calculate, and now she trys to imitate
the things she hears about
i offer her a helping hand, she chooses to stay on the ground
she wont stop 'till she figures out
what is fake begause she wants one
the loneliness drives her to the wrong one
i said you see the winds are changing
she doesn't see she's rearranging
she has control

you can't seperate, what you need and what you want
bad love isn't better than none
you try to simulate it, and you're always holding on
but bad love isn't better than none

banging down the doors of anyone who listens
screaming out loud there must be more than this in you
never find the end to your loneliness
'till you fill them with the space made from misereis
your soul with brightered added nothing
and you really don't believe that good love easycoming
all you see is that same brother
ever blacked out
and go without

you can't seperate, what you need and what you want
bad love isn't better than none
you try to simulate it, and you're always holding on
but bad love isn't better than none

you can't seperate, what you need and what you want
bad love isn't better than none
you try to simulate it, and you're always holding on
but bad love isn't better than none
