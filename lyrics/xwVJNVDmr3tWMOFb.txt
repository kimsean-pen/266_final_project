And in the nighttime, she's beautiful
She's got her mother's nose
But she won't remember a thing at all
Cause in your arms, she's home
Here comes the rain again, so strong
Oh, you'll get by until it's gone
She'll never realize what's wrong
He can't survive it all
The wind, the rain
The storm and and the tidal wave
Oh, she's brave, a soul to save
It's plain to see I don't believe in fairytales
Into the wind she sails
But justice always prevails
Oh, baby, sleep until we reach much calmer seas
I'll take you away with me
And save you from this disease
Stunned by the greatness, he's miles away
I wonder how you'll cope
But we're here to witness her eyes degrade
Her south London smile sees hope
Here comes the rain again, so strong
Oh, you'll get by until it's gone
She'll never realize what's wrong
You kept her eyes to the sun
You found the remedy to move on
And you can smile again
It's unconditional, that love
It's plain to see I don't believe in fairytales
Into the wind, she sails
But justice always prevails
Oh, baby, sleep until we reach much calmer seas
I'll take you away with me
To save you from this disease
It's clear to me that no one holds monopoly
She'll set your beauty free
And grant you your dignity
So baby, sleep, until we reach much calmer seas
I'll take you away with me
To save you from this disease
And in the nighttime, she's beautiful
I'm sure her mother knows
