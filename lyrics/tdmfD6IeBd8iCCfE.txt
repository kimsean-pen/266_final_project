Yeah!

There's no escaping the American attraction
A bait and switch that's gonna fill you with distraction
It sounds so good, you can't resist the satisfaction
When it's all over you'll be crying, I'll be laughing, yeah!

I got that gun, got that drug
I've got everything you want
I got that bomb, got that blood
I've got everything you not
It's the American attraction
It's the American attraction

The clock tick-tick-tick-ticking down to a disaster
Your insecurity is all they're coming after
This propaganda so impossible to resist
With ideology at least he's being honest

I got that gun, got that drug
I've got everything you want
I got that bomb, got that blood
I've got everything you not
It's the American attraction
It's the American attraction

You think it's us but it's the truth that it's a strategy
American beauty twisted into a tragedy
I'm in a place of glory

You got your gun, got your drug
You got your bomb, got your blood
And now we've had enough

I got that gun, got that drug
I've got everything you want
I got that bomb, got that blood
I've got everything you not
It's the American attraction
It's the American attraction

It's the American attraction (I got that gun, got that drug)
(I've got everything you want)
It's the American attraction (I got that bomb, got that blood)
(I've got everything you not)

Yeah!
