Beautiful, horrible, magical, terrible
Reason to laugh and smile, reason to cry yourself
To sleep at night, start a fight
Makeup, breakup, wrong or right
Heaven for all it's worth can equally be held right here on earth

And no one really knows
(No)
Anything about it
But everybody needs it
We can't live without it

And that's the way it goes
Darkest day, brightest night
Just some other things you might hear
If you ask what love feels like

And it feels like joy
And it feels like pain
And it feels like sunshine
Feels like rain

And excuse the dying
Reason to live
And if you don't know
That's what love is, love is, oh

Gentle kiss, sweet caress
Kiss the base of your neck
Argue until my head hurts
I can't remember what you said

Out, screaming loud
Don't know what we're screaming 'bout
So confusing, yes, it's true
But if it wasn't there what would we do?

And no one really knows
(No)
Anything about it
But everybody needs it
We can't live without it

And that's the way it goes
Oh, darkest day, brightest night
Just some other things you might hear
If you ask what love feels like

And it feels like joy
And it feels like pain
And it feels like sunshine
Feels like rain

And excuse the dying
Reason to live
And if you don't know
That's what love is, love is, oh

That's love
(The only thing that can bring you up or break you down)
That's love
(Beneath the sun up in your sky or the darkest cloud)
Darkest cloud

That's love
(And we need it)
That's love
(And we need it)
That's love
Oh, ask anybody how it feels

And it feels like joy
And it feels like pain
And it feels like sunshine
Feels like rain

And excuse the dying
Reason to live
And if you don't know
That's what love is, love is

And it feels like joy
(Joy)
And it feels like pain
(Pain)
And it feels like sunshine
Feels like rain

And excuse the dying
Reason to live
And if you don't know
That's what love is, love is
That's it
