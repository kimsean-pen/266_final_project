Just because they seem to understand the way you feel
It just doesn't mean that they'll feel the same way too
Just because they seem to hold a mirror to your life
It just doesn't follow that they'll be just like you

Take no heroes, it's no good
They don't stand up to you
Just take the bits you think that you can use

I remember when I was younger
I thought the answers were locked in people
So I admired the ones whose lives were
A source of envy to people like me

But do you really want to meet
The ones who write your dreams
Believe me, it's a fantasy
You won't like the reality

If you want heroes keep them safe
They don't stand up to life so
Lock them in your soul and lose the key

I love you, I don't wanna meet you X12

When I see you it makes me feel
There's someone else out there like me
You touch my soul with what you do
It all makes sense when I hear you
You understand the way I feel
I know exactly what you mean
It's like I've known you all my life
I think of you I feel alright

But in the flesh how would it be
If you could really see
The weaknesses you never knew
Alive and staring back at you

If you want heroes keep them safe
They don't stand up to life so
Lock them in your soul and lose the key
Lock them in your soul and lose the key
Lock them in your soul and lose the key
