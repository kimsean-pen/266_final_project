Was a long and dark December
From the rooftops I remember
There was snow, white snow
Clearly, I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below

When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low
If you love me, won't you let me know?

Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And a fog became God
Priests clutched onto bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And the cross was held aloft

Bury me in armor
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze
If you love me, won't you let me know?

I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow, far below
If you love me, why'd you let me go?

I took my love down to Violet Hill
Then we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still
So if you love me, won't you let me know?
If you love me, won't you let me know
