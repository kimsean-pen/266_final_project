When you dream
I hope that you'll dream of me
and if you ever fall
I hope you'll fall for me
and I swear I know your face
I saw you out there
'cause I depend on you
when you need me, you just call me
I'll be there
when you look over your shoulder
I'll be there
You don't ever have to worry
'cause I depend on you
I depend on you
When you breath
silent symphony
when you blink
you steal the sight from me
when we kiss
endless symmetry
you don't have to worry
I depend on you
I depend on you
No, you never have to worry
I depend on you
'Cause I'll be there in a hurry
I depend on you
when you need me I'll be coming
I depend on you
I depend on you
when you dream
I hope that you'll dream of me
and if you ever fall
I hope you'll fall for me
and I swear I know your face
I saw you out there
'cause I depend on you
when you need me, you just call me
I'll be there
when you look over your shoulder
I'll be there
You don't ever have to worry
'cause I depend on you
I depend on you
When you breath
silent symphony
when you blink
you steal the sight from me
when we kiss
endless symmetry
you don't have to worry
I depend on you
I depend on you
No, you never have to worry
I depend on you
'Cause I'll be there in a hurry
I depend on you
when you need me I'll be coming
I depend on you
I depend on you
I depend on you
I depend on you
I depend on you
I depend on you
