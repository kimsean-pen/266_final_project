Midnight approaches
Are you awake
I heard the devil, he was calling your name
Your soul is empty
Your words are cheap
You're selling for war
While you're praying for peace

But I don't think you want it
I want you to see
The tide is turning while there's something to save
You can't see it
You keep talking
When you stand for nothing
You'll fall for anything

We're fighting fire with gasoline
We'll leave the bridges burning
For all to see
We're fighting fire with gasoline
We'll leave the bridges burning
This is a warning
The devil's calling

Midnight it finds you
Down on your knees
Pray forgiveness while
You're trading lives away
The truth was hijacked
Gone without a trace
When all is done
We won't forget your face

I can feel the fire
I can see the pain
We're tired of choking on your hypocrisy
You can't see it
It's not working
When you stand for nothing
You'll fall for anything

We're fighting fire with gasoline
We'll leave the bridges burning
For all to see
We're fighting fire with gasoline
We'll leave the bridges burning
This is a warning
The devil's calling

We're fighting fire with gasoline
We'll leave the bridges burning
This is a warning
We're fighting fire with gasoline
We'll leave the bridges burning
For all to see
We're fighting fire with gasoline
We'll leave the bridges burning
This is a warning
We're fighting fire with gasoline
We'll leave the bridges burning
For all to see
We're fighting fire with gasoline
We'll leave the bridges burning
This is a warning
The devil's calling
