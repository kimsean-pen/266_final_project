Rivers so deep
When we were here last time
Twisted in sheets
All of these pastimes
Killing me slowly
I might just turn it off

Stranger things
Have made me think of you
This drink
And perfume
Do you think of me
Or do you just turn it off

I needed more (it was always muted)
I know you traded (covered in her blonde hair [?])
I needed more (it was always muted)
Breathe, breathe in

Put your hands on my skin
Your body will remember
Breathe out and I breathe in (undulating)
Put your hands on my skin
Remember
Your body will remember
Breathe in, breathe in

Put your thumb in my palm
Flow the lines, how they breathe in time
And I'm not yours and you're not mine
Something new that we'll never find again (breathe in)

I needed more (it was always muted)
I know you traded (covered in her blonde hair [?])
I needed more (it was always muted)
Breathe, breathe in

Put your hands on my skin
Your body will remember
Breathe out and I breathe in (undulating)
Put your hands on my skin
Remember
Your body will remember
Breathe in

Breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe in

Put your hands on my skin
Breathe out and I breathe in (undulating)
Put your hands on my skin
Remember
Your body will remember
Your body will remember

Breathe out and
Breathe in and put your hands on my skin
Breathe out and your body will remember
Breathe in and your body will remember
