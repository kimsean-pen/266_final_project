I want you
To know the truth
'Cause I've
Been around before
Thought I
Wasn't looking anymore

Been a fool for weeks
'Cause my heart stands for nothing
And your soul's too weak
Got a will
That's been around for days
Goes far if you want it
It needs to behave
But then you
You come around
Big mistake

I don't want to know
I don't want to know
We don't need a sign to know
Better times

Running around 'cause you beat yourself up
'Cause you made a crack and the one that you love is gone
How much longer can you play with fire
Before you turn into a liar, huh?

I've been around before
Thought you weren't looking anymore
But then we
We come and go
Go up in smoke

I don't want to know
I don't want to know
We don't need a sign to know
Better times
