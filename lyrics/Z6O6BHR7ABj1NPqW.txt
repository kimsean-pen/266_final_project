Well I'm always saying I'm sorry
Your always saying you're broke
But I'll keep my hands on the steering wheel
If you keep your eyes on the road

But it's not like you anyway
To hide your sad face away
It ain't gonna stay the same
Cause it's got old

You'll always run me in circles
Chasing me round like a mouse
But I'll keep on watching this movie
If it means I can stay at your house

But it's not like you anyway
To hide your sad face away
It ain't gonna stay the same
Cause it's got old
Cause it's got old
Cause it's got old
Cause it's got old
Cause it's got old
