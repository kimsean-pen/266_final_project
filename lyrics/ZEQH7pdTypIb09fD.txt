I never felt so weak, and special at the same time
Taken for a fool I'm a child
Let's play jack and the beanstalk, and free fall
I got a screw loose in my mind
Tears my body into a pile
My soul seeks the light
My lover fears my dive

I find my way, elevate
I find my way

Give me something I have nothing of my own
It's like trying get blood out of a stone
I'm just a vicious circle (Just a vicious circle)
A circle of my own
Jumping and I'm cutting at the rope
Don't try and stop me I am rotten to the bone
I'm just a vicious circle (Just a vicious circle)

I explode in my own ride so gone
Through the long night too long
And the plane crash in front of me
You fade away

I find my way, elevate
I find my way

Give me something I have nothing of my own
It's like trying get blood out of a stone
I'm just a vicious circle (Just a vicious circle)
Jumping and I'm cutting at the rope
Don't try and stop me I am rotten to the bone
I'm just a vicious circle (Just a vicious circle)
A circle of my own

Tell me that you're loving me
Even though I keep sweatin' out, keep sweatin' out
I know it seems like I'm always gonna keep dragging you down, dragging you down
When the planes crash in front of me
My darling, darling
Oh I'm falling, falling

Give me something I have nothing on my own
I'm jumping and I'm cutting at the rope
It's just a vicious circle
A circle of my own
La la la la
Give me something, something
I have nothing, nothing
Of my own
I'm rotten to the bone
Give me something, something
I have nothing, nothing
Of my own
I'm rotten to the bone
