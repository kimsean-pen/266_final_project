In the game of love
It takes all you got
Just to keep it moving up
Don't you wanna reach the top
But heaven seems such a crazy dream
If your heart has room for doubt
You're neither in you're neither out

99 1/2 it just won't do
You gotta give me all of you
Not asking too much of a heart that's true
So tell me...

What's the name of the game that we are playing
But whenever I think that we are winning
Then you roll the dice take a slide
Right back to the one from 99

Is it gonna go on like this forever
Are we gonna to take that last step together
Going round and round and up and down
Feels just like snakes and ladders

Baby don't it feel like a carousel
Where all the world is rushing by
But when it stops you realize
That you're right back where you started at
I need a little more than that
It time for us to face the facts

Whether to be or not to be
That is the question so it seems
We're going nowhere in between
So tell me...

What's the name of the game that we are playing
But whenever I think that we are winning
Then you roll the dice take a slide
Right back to the one from 99

Don't wanna play this game no more
I gotta know right now for sure
What am I giving my heart for
Baby I need a little more
Don't leave me hanging on a string
Now that I gave you everything

Not when I play to win
Snakes and ladders

What's the name of the game that we are playing
But whenever I think that we are winning
Then you roll the dice take a slide
Right back to the one from 99

What's the name of the game that we are playing
But whenever I think that we are winning
Then you roll the dice take a slide
Right back to the one from 99
