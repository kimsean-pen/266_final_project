We're gonna make this happen
I'm gonna fly forever
We're gonna ride the rainbow

Find that open road
Catch that blazing star
And climb out of that hole
To wonder where we are

We're gonna make this happen
I'm gonna fly forever
We're gonna ride the rainbow

Where omens scar your door
Like a harvest
We're bound and set for war
But no soldier comes

A serpent for your fist
And a scarab for your mouth
The symptoms say persist, so resist
But a cure is not in doubt

We're gonna make this happen
I'm gonna fly forever
We're gonna ride the rainbow

You'll just rise on forever
As my halo shines in you
When doldrums age in platinum
I've a starship you can use

We're gonna make this happen
I'm gonna fly forever
We're gonna ride the rainbow
I'm gonna fly forever
We're gonna make this happen
I'm gonna fly forever
We're gonna ride the rainbow

We're gonna make this happen
I'm gonna fly forever
We're gonna ride the rainbow
