Jason and I were on
Our way to see Iron Lung when some
Bug-eyed stranger handed us
The Constitution
We thought he was either
Insane or high
'Till a sniper on a rooftop
Killed the poor guy

Before we knew it
We were under attack
By Dick Cheney
In his Halliburton jet pack
We ran for our lives
Straight into the clutches
Of the FBI
But we were rescued
By the actor Michael Ironside
He explained the whole
Cloak and dagger scheme
He called in the Swedish
Lesbian commando team
After the final battle
In the Illuminati secret base
We had cow tongue tacos
From a food truck in Chevy Chase
