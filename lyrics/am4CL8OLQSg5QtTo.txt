Be kind
Be kind

How tall will I grow?
Only time will show
It passes by slowly
I feel hollow and tiny

Be kind, let in the light
With time, let in the light

How tall will I grow?
Only time will show
It passes by slowly
And feels as though you are breaking

You are an indication
Of trust and affection
With the purest intentions
We plant our love in you

Be kind, let in the light
With time, let in the light
Let in the light

How tall I will grow?
Only time will show
It passes by in heartbeats
I feel my insides quaking

You are an indication
Of trust and affection
With the purest intentions
I plant my love in you
