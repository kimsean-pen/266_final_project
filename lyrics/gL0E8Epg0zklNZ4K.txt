This is where the chapter ends
A new one now begins
Time has come for letting go
The hardest part is when you know

All of these years when we were here are ending
But I'll always remember

We have had the time of our lives
And now the pages turn, the stories we will write
We have had the time of our lives
And I will not forget the faces left behind

It's hard to walk away from the best of days
But if it has to end, I'm glad you have been my friend
In the time of our lives

Where the water meets the land
There is shifting in the sand
Like the tide that ebbs and flows
Memories will come and go

All of these years when we were here are ending
But I'll always remember

We have had the time of our lives
And now the page is turned, the stories we will write
We have had the time of our lives
And I will not forget the faces left behind

It's hard to walk away from the best of days
But if it has to end, I'm glad you have been my friend
In the time of our lives

We say goodbye, we hold on tight
To these memories that never die
We say goodbye, we hold on tight
To these memories that never die

We have had the time of our lives
And now the page is turned, the stories we will write
We have had the time of our lives
And I will not forget the faces left behind

It's hard to walk away from the best of days
But if it has to end, I'm glad you have been my friend
In the time of our lives
I'm glad you have been my friend
In the time of our lives
