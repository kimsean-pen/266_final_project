Slow slow slow
Wade through water
Numbed the lightness
Words don't bother
I cannot fight the sleep is droning
Into the motion into the night
Is it the glow that keeps you moving
Hemiplegia holds me tight
Gold for gold
Burns our ocean
Forced I sold
My devotion
I cannot fight the sleep is droning
Into the motion into the night
Is it the glow that keeps you moving
Hemiplegia holds me tight

No you can't move up with your eyes down, no you can't move up
