In Westfield with the vacuum seal, smoking 'til I can't even feel

In Westfield with the vacuum seal, smoking 'til I can't even feel
My face, my face (my face)

Why would you wanna go home with the DJ
When you can stay out with the real Bladee?
Snake blood all in my cup, but I bleed gray
Wanna do me sideways but I see straight
Ecco pull up in LA in a i8
I get the bag, they drop off for me, Postmates
See you rolling off some pills, baby, hydrate
At the Hyatt, smoking drain, had to violate
Put Draino in my glass for the headache
Can't hide it anymore so I escape
Tell Nino "bring an 8th of the high grade"
Upgraded on them quick, give me migraine
Rainworld, the CEO, give me mild rain
Frosty, I'm drinking ice, give me Ice brain
Brain freeze, I'm in the east by the palm trees
Drain team, I sip that bleach for a blood leech
Drain team, I sip that bleach for a blood leech
No cut for you, I cut out my trustees
Walk in Prada, treat that shit like it's Nike
You hate on me, got two letters - I C
