Predict the day you wanted to get away
A second chance is calling for you
Predict the day you wanted to get away
No second chance is calling for you

Predict the day you sentence your enemies
Don't look away they're coming for you
Predict the day you're bathing in victory
A second chance had fallen for you

Predict the day the night's never ending
As shadow falls darken your face
I never thought, I didn't think twice
I never thought

Predict the day the night's never ending
As shadow falls darken your face
I never thought, I didn't think twice
I never thought

Predict the day the night's never ending
As shadow falls darken your face
I never thought, I didn't think twice
I never thought

Predict the day the night's never ending
As shadow falls darken your face
I never thought, I didn't think twice
I never thought

Predict the day the night's never ending
As shadow falls darken your face
I never thought, I didn't think twice
I never thought

Predict the day the night's never ending
As shadow falls darken your face
I never thought, I didn't think twice
I never thought
