If I'm not the one you want
Take your time to figure out

Hey yeah

I'm staring at your picture every night
The scent of you still lingers in my mind
I wonder if you're alone and feel alright
And the sun has come out of the clouds

And sometimes when I listen to our song
Night seems so cold and far too long
I wanna call you up cause in the end
I keep writing letters to my garbage can

Lately, feels like I'm going crazy
And baby, come and lay down beside me

If I'm not the one you want, then who's he?
Take your time to figure out, and you'll see
If I'm not the one you want, then maybe
I'll be the one you need

I feel like it's on you I can depend
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Enough of building castles in the sand
Why can't we be forever?

Lately, feels like I'm going crazy
And baby, come and lay down beside me

If I'm not the one you want, then who's he?
Take your time to figure out, and you'll see
If I'm not the one you want, then maybe
I'll be the one you need (I'll be the one you need)

If I'm not the one you want, then who's he?
Take your time to figure out, and you'll see
If I'm not the one you want, then maybe
I'll be the one you need

Somewhere, in the back of my mind (back of my mind)
I know that you will be mine (you will be mine)
Somehow, wish I could rewind (I could rewind)
And leave all the worries behind
If I'm not the one you want
I'll be the one you need (I'll be the one you need)
Take your time to figure out
I'll be the one you need (I'll be the one you need)
If I'm not the one you want, then who's he?
Take your time to figure out, and you'll see
If I'm not the one you want, then maybe
I'll be the one you need (I'll be the one you need)
I'll be the one you need
