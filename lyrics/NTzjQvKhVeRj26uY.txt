You
Youve been talkin' in your sleep, again
It makes
It makes me wonder where your mind has been
But I dont... talk... sleep... talk

Oh I dont wanna do the sleep talk, baby
wake up and tell me what you mean
Oh I dont wanna do the sleep talk, baby
Go on and tell me what you mean
Oh Im tired of playing sleep talk, baby
wake up and tell me what you mean
Oh I dont wanna do the sleep talk, baby
Go on and tell me what you mean

And you
Oh youve been talking in your sleep, again
It makes
It makes me wonder where your mind has been
Oh I dont... talk... sleep... talk

Oh I dont wanna do the sleep talk, baby
Wake up and tell me what you mean
Oh I dont wanna play that sleep talk, baby
Come on and tell me what you mean
Oh Im tired of playing sleep talk, baby
Wake up and tell me what you mean
Oh I dont wanna do that sleep talk, baby
Come on and tell me what you mean
