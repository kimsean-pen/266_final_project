all the good girls you take out for dinner but all the bad girls you take out for liquor
all the good girls they don't pull the trigger
but all that bad girls they pull it much quicker
it's never too late to get down

just let your body go
we'll take it nice and slow
just let your mind be free
and come in close to me

Oh the good girls they go to heaven but the bad girls they get backstage

all the good girls they act like beginners but all the bad girls they know that they're sinners
all the good girls are really good kissers but all the bad girls are really good strippers
baby don't slow it down let's keep going
I think that you and I should lose clothing I think that all good girls just need coaching

just let your mind be free
and come in close to me
