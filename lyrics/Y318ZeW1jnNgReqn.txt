You can blame it on the small things
You can blame it on your heartbeat,
The wrong day
You can blame it on your regrets,
And all your little secrets, you keep them
You can show me all your old scars,
You got from all the old wars
You fought so you could tell me,
"I'm not the one who needs saving"

You can say what you want
But it's only getting better
It's alright
Oh baby, it's alright
You can try to deny
But it's only getting better
It's alright
Oh baby, it's alright now you

You think it feels right
But you don't know
You've got everything you wanted
But you're not sure
You can say what you please
If it's all that you need
To believe it's getting better
You can blame it on me

There's a million ways to hold on
To everything that goes wrong,
The sad songs
Oh, but all these different reasons
Are just a million different ways to say the same old thing
Now tell me,
"I'm not the one who needs saving"

You can say what you want
But it's only getting better
It's alright,
Oh baby it's alright,
You can try to deny
But it's only getting better
It's alright,
Oh baby, it's alright now

You think it feels right
But you don't know
You've got everything you wanted
But you're not sure
You can say what you please
If it's all that you need
To believe it's getting better
You can blame it on me
You can blame it on me
You can blame it on me

You can blame it on the small things

Say what you want
But it's only getting better
It's alright
Oh baby it's alright
You can try to deny
But it's only getting better
It's alright
Oh baby it's alright now

You think it feels right
But you don't know
You've got everything you wanted
But you're not sure
You can say what you please
If it's all that you need
To believe it's getting better
You can blame it on me
You can blame it on me
You can blame it on me
Come on
