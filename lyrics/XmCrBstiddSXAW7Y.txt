Look at this world, it's filled with worn out faces
Forgotten places where nothing changes
Whatever happened to that new day rising
We're just surviving when living is dying

Aren't you tired of being let down?
Another day, another shakedown

I'm with you
When hope is gone and all you want is the truth
I'm with you
You carry on when they say it's no use
I'm with you
I'm with you
If I've got one thing I've got something to prove
We all got nothing if there's nothing to lose
I'm with you

I walk in shadows they seem all familiar
I read the paper, life forsaken
A vacant storefront, I'm one more "for sale" sign
Down on Main Street you just walk by

How many times we got to break down
Before somebody's gonna shout out

I'm with you
When hope is gone and all you want is the truth
I'm with you
You carry on when they say it's no use
I'm with you
I'm with you
If I've got one thing I've got something to prove
We all got nothing if there's nothing to lose
I'm with you

When hope is gone and all you want is the truth
I'm with you
You carry on when they say it's no use
They say it's no use
Well I've got one thing I've got something to prove
We all got nothing if there's nothing to lose
I'm with you
I'm with you
I'm with you (I'm with you)
I'm with you (I'm with you)
I'm with you (I'm with you)
