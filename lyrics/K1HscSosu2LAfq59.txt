Tell me
Of your
Frail dreams
My dear girl

Until
Your heart
Won't hold
Anymore

Forgiven negligence
My withered soul will never go
Courtesy relevant
The only thing that I won't know

Give in
To Guilt
You'll see
You'll regret

The hands
Of home
Let go
Forget you

Forgiven negligence
My withered soul will never go
Courtesy relevant
The only thing that I won't know

I won't know

Forgiven negligence
My withered soul will never go
Courtesy relevant
The only thing that I won't know
