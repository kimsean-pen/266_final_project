It's Barbie (Barbie, Barbie)

We got tom-toms over here bigger than a monster
Block, block, block, block, block, block, block, block
We got tom-toms over here bigger than a monster
Block, block, block, block, block, block, block, block

Tom-tom like in Lebanon, hotter than in Pakistan
Click, click, click, Young Nick the atomic bomb
Yeah, see it then you lick your tongue
Bet that it tastes good, get you some

Wicked, the ten bad bitches
We sh-sh-shut it down like the club got glitches
Dig it?

And when you do that G.T.'s pulling up, yeah
Spaceship, E.T.'s in the cut, yeah
P-p-pop a bottle just to gettin' my head right
Tell the doctor go and gettin' my meds right

Monster, you know it wouldn't be proper
If we done return with a big rocket launcher

Massive attack, massive attack
Got them bomb-bombs make the whole club go back
Hey, bet the DJ gon' bring this one back
Hey, like the swagger mom bring on this track, hey

Massive attack, massive attack
What's been done-done need no more say that's that
Hey, never find me in the club laid back
I wanna jump to this jam until we see the sun

So, so hot in here it feels like a jungle, yeah
Me don't like boys that enjumble
One-time bust a shot for my champion girls
Tell 'em guys super-size me a combo

N-n-no one got the ammo, that's why I bullet-proofed the Lambo
In the middle-east on a camel
Runnin' through the jungle, Rambo, Liberace tango
Swingin' on a vine, mango

So call me Simba, little mama, 'cause Mufasa couldn't stop a bitch
I fly in on that chopper just to buy Balenciaga
It's just me, Mr. Miyagi, and the Phantom of the Opera
Goin' blocka motherfucker, got that big rocket launcher

Massive attack, massive attack
Got them bomb-bombs make the whole club go back
Hey, bet the DJ gon' bring this one back
Hey, like the swagger mom bring on this track, hey

Massive attack, massive attack
What's been done-done need no more say that's that
Hey, never find me in the club laid back
I wanna jump to this jam until we see the sun

Detonating a bomb, detonating a fire
Ros√© by the bucket, money-makin' attire
Detonating a bomb, detonating them hits
Fixin' to buy up the bar, all my bitches is rich

You better duck when it comes, better duck 'cause it's comin'
Best believe me we're on, got them runnin', r-runnin'
Now tell them rap bitches that Nicki said this
We got tom-toms over here bigger than a monster

We got tom-toms over here bigger than a monster
Block, block, block, block, block, block, block, block
We got tom-toms over here bigger than a monster
Block, block, block, block, block, block, block, block

Massive attack, massive attack
Got them bomb-bombs make the whole club go back
Hey, bet the DJ gon' bring this one back
Hey, like the swagger mom bring on this track, hey

Massive attack, massive attack
What's been done-done need no more say that's that
Hey, never find me in the club laid back
I wanna jump to this jam until we see the sun
