Go to work and take your calls
Hang the fruits of your labour on the walls
Such precision and care
What does it matter
if there's no one here to share
the flowers in the garden
the wine
the Waiting for Godot
and so much modern time?

All I want is what you want
I'm always waiting for a red letter day

The years perfecting a stance
of measured cool fade into insignificance
the moment one starts to understand
what on earth does it profit a man?

All I want is what you want
I'm always waiting for a red letter day
for something special, somehow new
someone saying 'I love you'
Baby, I'm waiting
for that red letter day

You can sneer or disappear
behind a veneer of self-control
but for all of those
who don't fit it
who follow their instincts
and are told they sin
this is a prayer for
a different way

All I want is what you want
I'm always waiting for a red letter day
like Christmas morning when you're a kid
Admit you love me and you always did
Baby, I'm hoping
for that red letter day
today
