Pretty thin gap
You know what I mean
The habit you can break
But the friend you can't leave

You gotta step back
Sometimes just to see
The weight of all those words
When they slip past our teeth

And I knew that I couldn't hide
No, this feeling won't
Feeling don't
Subside
Subside

Pretty thin line
You know what they say
If you had seen it coming
Should've made your escape

Pretty thin gap
You know what I mean
The habit you can break
But the friend you can't leave

I knew that I couldn't hide
No, this feeling won't
Feeling don't
Subside
Subside
Subside
Subside, subside, subside

Oh, I wanna know
Does it still hurt
No, we'd have found a cure
And die from thirst
And die from thirst

And we don't talk
Now when we speak
At least never
Since you told me
I lied to you first
I lied to you first
