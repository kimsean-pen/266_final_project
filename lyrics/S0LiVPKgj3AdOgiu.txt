I never got that particular feeling
I'm doing better now than how I've been
Then again I never really ever get anything right

I've got a scab that I can't stop picking
Things that I though I'd forgotten
Things that I thought got better over night
So what's shaking, a complication

I though by now I'd be 5'11"
I'd be hanging out with the top banana
Executive access to upper classes
Run and get me some of them big sunglasses

Better gather up what I left for dead
All the pieces needed in a level head
All the information that I've taken down all on my own

So if you think you saw me getting by
I was only lost in another life
And now I'm racing back to where I came from, I got nothing to show
What's shaking, a complication

I though by now I'd be 5'11"
I'd be hanging out with the top banana
Executive access to upper classes
Run and get me some of them big sunglasses

I though by now
I'd be 5'11"
I'd be hanging out
with the top banana
Executive access to upper classes
Run and get me some of them big sunglasses

I've got a little left, I've got a little left in me
I'm not finished yet, I've got a little left in me

I've got a scab that I can't stop picking
Things that I thought I'd forgotten
And now I'm racing back to where I came from, I got nothing to show
What shaking, a complication

I though by now I'd be 5'11"
I'd be hanging out with the top banana
Executive access to upper classes
Run and get me some of them big sunglasses

I though by now
I'd be 5'11"
I'd be hanging out
with the top banana
Executive access to upper classes
Run and get me some of them big sunglasses
