The only meaning you will find
In this world, this pointless life,
Is the one that you create
For yourself... to be your guide.

If there is no distraction
From the darkness and the pain
By the presence of a lover,
A companion or a friend,
To ease the gravity of sadness
And the dark tide of despair...
Then nothing ever really matters,
And you're not going... anywhere.

The only bliss that you will find,
In this cruel world, this wretched life,
Is the one that you create
For yourself... in your own mind.
