Full-blooded, words like knives
But it's not the same since the old girl died
You know, I used to see the city's white glow from up here

Oh my, look at all that rain
Money's tighter now and they keep us tame
But you know you're done when the TV's watching you

It's not what it seems like where we are
But I'm loyal to the cause
If you are

Fractured lives like fault lines
Unto the breach my friends, if you will
But it's rude to stare at the ceiling while I beg you

Sweet sleep don't call my name
I've got miles to go and wars to wage
When this thing is done I'll crawl back into your womb

It's not what it seems like where we are
But I'm loyal to the cause
If you are

If you are...
