This bullet
Will burn a hole
Through the heavens
Straight from my barrel
Light up the sky

I will shoot your paradise down to the ground
Down to the ground

This bullet
Will win the war
That has echoed on
Since the first footsteps of time

I will shoot your paradise down to the ground
Shoot it down

Divine reward
Gift wrapped in thorns
Drop it
Blood starts to run
From the cuts
Now you'll never stop it
Load up your gun
For some fun
It's time to cock it
Lean in and aim
And light up the sky

Your paradise stands no chance

This bullet will burn a hole
Kill and take control

Immortality teases me
Self immolation fantasy
Swirls and kicks in my belly up through my head
Rushing to every limb
It sends me to another dimension
Tripping out beyond time and beyond the clouds
Fucked up, strung out, and chained down
I will shoot paradise to the ground

Take the world with me; I will

I will 'cause I hate heaven hanging over my head

I hate heaven hanging over my head

I'll shoot it down

Bring it down

This bullet
Will burn a hole
Through the heavens
Straight from my barrel
Light up the sky

I will shoot your paradise down to the ground

This bullet will burn a hole
Kill and take control
