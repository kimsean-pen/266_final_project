I, I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired
And letting all these negative thoughts collide
Why betray my mind when I know the control is mine
Got no time to sit on the sidelines and watch them play
The people around the world
The people around the world
Gotta strike like lightning and shine like we're not afraid
People around the world

Say, I'm alive
I'm breathing today
I'm alive
Just dying to make a good vibe
I'm still in the game
And I won't live my life afraid
(I won't live my life afraid)

No, nobody can relieve me of my ghosts
But I refuse to let em define my soul
Though, they come and go
I'm the one with the guts to stay
Got no time to sit on the sidelines
And watch them play
People around the world
People around the world
Gotta strike like lightning
And shine through the pouring rain
People around the world

Say, I'm alive
I'm breathing today
I'm alive
Just dying to make a good vibe
I'm still in the game
And I won't live my life afraid
Hey! Oh!
Hey! Oh!
Hey! Oh!
Sing it back! Sing it back! Sing it back!
Ladies! Eeeh-eh-eh Go!
(Eeeh-eh-eh)
Fellas! Oooh-oh-oh
Oooh-oh-oh

I'm alive
I'm breathing today
I'm alive
Just dying to make a good vibe
I'm still in the game
And I won't live my life afraid
I won't live my life afraid

I'm alive
I'm breathing today
I'm alive
Just dying to make a good vibe
I'm still in the game
And I won't live my life afraid

I'm alive
I'm breathing today
I'm alive
Just dying to make a good vibe
I'm still in the game
And I won't live my life afraid
