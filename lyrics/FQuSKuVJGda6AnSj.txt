On my way back home
A chance I thought of
All my favorite songs
And where I'd gone wrong

The only words that I could think of
I'm pissing my life away in the form of song
On my way back home

A victory it was
I was cheating death
And just in time I woke

My memory would start to wander off
And come to me
The remembrance of on my way back home

I came in this way
In here now I'll stay
If the unknown will have to wait one more day

Cause often times then it comes out wrong
But luckily, I got a mind to know
On my way back home
