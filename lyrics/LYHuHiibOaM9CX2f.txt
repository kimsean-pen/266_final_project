Love was cold, just a memory
Was a slave to my history
So long, too long

Through the silence I heard you call
My defences began to fall
I'm yours, all yours

I need your love to warm me like a sun
Inside my heart, I still believe in magic
Without your touch, don't know what i become
With all my heart, I still believe in magic

No more shadows, you gave me light
Woke me up, brought me back to life
Won't be lonely again

In a trance, I'm oblivious
All that's left is the two of us
Right here, right now, always

I need your love to warm me like a sun
Inside my heart, I still believe in magic
Without your touch, don't know what I become
With all my heart, I still believe in magic

Do you believe?
Do you believe?
Do you believe?
Do you believe in magic [whispered]
I need your love [autotuned and looped]

I need your love to warm me like a sun
Inside my heart, I still believe in magic
Without your touch, don't know what i become
With all my heart, I still believe in magic
