Early this morning
You knocked upon my door
Early this mornin'
Ieuhwww
You knocked upon my door
And I said, "Hello, Satan,
I believe it's time to go"

Me and the devil
We're walking side by side
Me and the devil
Were walking side by side
I'm gonna beat my woman
Untill I get satisfied

She said she don't see why
That I will dog her 'round
(Now baby, you know you ain't doing me right)
She said she don't see why
Whoehoeee
That I will dog her 'round
Well, it must be that old evil spirit
So deep down in the ground

You may bury my body
Down by the highway side
(I don't care where you bury my body when I'm dead and gone)
You may bury my body
Down by the highway side
Oh, my old evil spirit
Can take a Greyhound bus and ride
