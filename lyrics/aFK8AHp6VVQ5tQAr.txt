I'm suicidal, maniacal, self-destructive
You leave me no hope, no life
Nothing worth living for
I've taken it, can't take it anymore
My worst nightmare
You make me want to slit my own fucking throat
Just so I'll be rid of you
Just to get rid of you

You self-righteous fuck
Give me a reason not to rip your fucking face off
Why don't you take a good look in these eyes
'Cause I'm the one that's gonna tear your fucking heart out
My hate is contagious
You've got no one to run to
Exile
Exile
Exile
Exile

Just tell me fucking why everything becomes an issue
Your opinion is always senseless
Fuck this, you make my fucking skin crawl
I've lived with it, can't stand anymore
My worst nightmare
I want to take a bullet in the fucking head
Every time I think of you
Every time I think of you

You self-righteous fuck
Give me a reason not to rip your fucking face off
Why don't you take a good look in these eyes
'Cause I'm the one that's gonna tear your fucking heart out
My hate is contagious
Anyone else need to vent?
You've tried my tolerance
I just want you to die

There's nothing more for me to say
There's nothing more for you to say
There's nothing more for us to say
I fucking hate you anyway
Exile
Exile
Exile
Exile

Can't count the ways that you light my fuckin' fuse
I can't tolerate the sight of you
The thought of you or anything about you
You know what I want to see?
How many ways can a loser fucking lose
I know you'll find a way
The humility awakening the idiot inside
You spineless fucking maggot, you're just wasting my time

Get out of my face
Get out of my life
Out of my fucking way
Just die
