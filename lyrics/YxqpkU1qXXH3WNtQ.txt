Fall back
All out of words
Too busy trying to save them for the truth.
So brutal the nights they are.
I couldn't sleep the streets were oh so cold.

To die, to be asleep.
We'll have the darkness to the roaring sea.
So foolish I know you are,
To take a walk and never so much stars.

And then I start to dream
But I can't read directions in my sleep.
The sun comes with the tide
And it's so beautiful I close my eyes.
