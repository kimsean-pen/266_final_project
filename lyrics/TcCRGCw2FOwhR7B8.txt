When the winds starts, the place that we bury long
And resurrect for others
Past alone, one another
Finding 2 visions, the path
Trying to change each other, before it hurts so bad
The world has gone away
What you found only breaks
There's nothing left to say
To the other, dont be afraid
Finding 2 visions, the path

Trying to change each other, before it hurts so bad
When the winds starts, the place that we bury long
And resurrect for others
Past alone, one another
Finding 2 visions, the path
Trying to change each other, before it hurts so bad
Before I feel so bad.
