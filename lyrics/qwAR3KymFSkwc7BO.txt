Every time you go
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Every time you go

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It starts with a picture
And it sits in your frame

And we part with a letter
And it ends in my name
It starts with forever
And it ends with a touch

And I know that you're clever

And I don't ask for much
Ooh...
Maybe we forgot all the things we are, we are together
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You said I'm arresting
You said I had heat
I really thought that we'd go further

The second time we'd meet
Now I'm tired of trying to keep you
All I want to do is sleep
But perhaps when I'm sleeping

You'll get back on your feet

Ooh...

Maybe we forgot all the things we are, we are together
Wake me up
Wake me up
Stop my fall

Everytime you go
Tape me up
Then break me up
Ever so gently

When I'm my weakest
Then it's not so hard
Everytime you go
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I run a mount to meet you when I knew the storm had come
And I felt the rain on your face and the damage you had done
I know what you're thinking - it will never be the end

And when the storm is over, you won't see me again
Ooh...
Didn't know the price I'd paid for all the times I stayed

When we were together
Wake me up
Wake me up
Stop my fall
Everytime you go
Tape me up
Then break me up
Ever so gently
When I'm my weakest
Then it's not so hard
Maybe we forget, are we awake or not?
Maybe we forget, are we awake or not?
Maybe we forget, are we awake or not?
Or maybe we forgot
Wake me up
Wake me up
Stop my fall
Everytime you go
Tape me up
Then break me up
Ever so gently
When I'm my weakest
Wake me up
Wake me up
Stop my fall
Everytime you go
Tape me up
Then break me up
Ever so gently
When I'm my weakest
it's come so hard
Everytime you go
