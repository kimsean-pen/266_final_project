Sometimes I wonder where it is loves goes
I don't know if even Heaven knows
I know we had some dreams
That didn't quite come true
And now I'm not the one
Little boy, who's keeping you

I was either standing in your shadow
Or blocking your light
Though I kept on tryin'
I could not make it right
For this girl
There's just not enough love in the world

I know people hurt you so bad
They don't know the damage they can do
And it makes me so sad
How we knock each other down
Just like children on a playground
Even after that o' sun went down

I was either standing in your shadow
Or blockin' your light
Though I kept on tryin'
I could not make it right
For this girl
There's just not enough love in the world

Oh darling this is still a shady little town
And sometimes it's so hard to smile
For the world, for the camera
Still have something left
You don't have to prove nothing to nobody
Just take good care of yourself

I'm not easy to live with
I know that it's true
You're no picnic either, baby
And that's one of the things
I loved about you
But a time will come around
When we need to settle down
Got to get off this merry-go-round

I was either standing in your shadow
Or blockin' your light
Though I kept on tryin'
I could not make it right
For this girl
There's just not enough love in the world

For this girl
There's just not enough love in the world
For this girl
There's just not enough love in the world
(For this girl there's not enough love)
(For this girl there's not enough love)
In the world
(For this girl there's not enough love)
This girl
(For this girl)There just not enough love
In the world
(For this girl there's not enough love)
In the world
(For this girl there's not enough love)
(For this girl there's not enough love)
