You said:
Baby, come up to the office you sang at my party I owe you some money.

You owe me
your lips I'm gonna give tips
and I heard your boyfriend is out of town?
Baby aren't you hungry? I could feed you cookies,
I could get my carkeys.
Oh what a cute dress, but right now it's useless
I heard your boyfriend is out of town?

I said you should get out of town too!
I said you should get out of town too!

You said:
Baby, I know you like me,
You know that we want us, really, I'm serious.
We could have good fun and we're only young once
and I heard your boyfriend is out of town!

Baby where are you going?
Don't be such a diva, you can't just leave now
Come back, don't bore me, you can't just ignore me.
Isn't your boyfriend out of town? I said yes.

And you should get out of town too!
I said you should get out of town too!
I said you should get out of town too!
I said you, you should get out of town too!
