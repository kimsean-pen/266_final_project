There comes the last spring now
I'll take the time and love you more

And I will cover you now
I will cover you now
Your mother, you will not let her fade

I am old now
I am older
I am old now
I am older

In this world we'll overcome
The autumn days, the hidden sun

And I will cover you now
I'll cover you now
Your father, he'll be in the air you breathe

I am old now
I am older

I am old now
I am older than I ever was before

Old times they will last
Lay your head to rest
