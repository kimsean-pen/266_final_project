theres a hunger in your bed tonight and
you think your worthy of a better life but
try to pretend your something new and then
maybe it works this time my friend but i know
you still get that feeling

lost the hunger in your head tonight
you miss the roses on her bathroom tiles but

they say this life ain't long enough.
ive never been wrong four times before cos i know...

oh they sold you
now they own you
skin, bones and eyes
well it all takes time

they say this life ain't long enough
maybe you'll find some peace of mind but i know

oh they sold you
now they own you
skin, bones and eyes
well it all takes time
