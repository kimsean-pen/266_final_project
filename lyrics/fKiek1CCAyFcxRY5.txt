I left a message on your phone
You never called me
I know I should leave you alone
It's not likely

Found myself walking down your street
Why did you never notice me?

Empty picture frames on the wall
I see your face
I keep my front door unlocked
Just in case

Found myself walking down your street
Why did you never notice me?

You're taking up all my time
Da-da-da, da-da-da
You ghost of mine
You're taking up all my time
Da-da-da, da-da-da
You ghost of mine

Thought I heard you saying my name
Made my head spin
Oh no what a shame
You're under my skin

I swear I barely ever sleep
Up all night I will be waiting

You're taking up all my time
Da-da-da, da-da-da,
You ghost of mine
You're taking up all my time
Da-da-da, da-da-da
You ghost of mine

I left a message on your phone
(Found myself walking down your street)
I know I should leave you alone
(Why did you never notice me?)
Thought I heard you saying my name
(I swear I barely ever sleep)
Oh no, what a shame

You're taking up all my time
Da-da-da, da-da-da
You ghost of mine
You're taking up all my time
Da-da-da, da-da-da
You ghost of mine

Da-da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da
