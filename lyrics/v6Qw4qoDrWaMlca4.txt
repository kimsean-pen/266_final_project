Trust me
Trust me when I say that I was innocent
Trust me
He'd only stay 'cause we were just listening
Yeah, we were just listening

And I know what you think
I know you're scared I find someone else
And I know what you think
That I'm being paid for a little beyond there
And you will be torn in two
Well I've got some news for you

I don't break hearts
I don't do funny business
I just ride cars and watch them get hung up in it
I don't break hearts
I don't do funny business
I just ride in cars and watch them get hung up in it

Trust me
My word is good and I swear no one else's
Trust me
I got the loyalty, I've learned my lessons
Yeah, I've learned my lessons

And I know what you think
I know you're scared I find someone else
And I know what you think
That I'm being paid for a little beyond there
And you will be torn in two
Well I've got some news for you

I don't break hearts
I don't do funny business
I just ride cars and watch them get hung up in it
I don't break hearts
I don't do funny business
I just ride in cars and watch them get hung up in it

If you think about it, will the lightning strike?
If you think about it, hope you realize
If you think about it, will the lightning strike?
If you think about it, hope you realize

I don't play cards
I don't do funny business
I just ride cars and watch them get hung up in it
I don't break hearts
I don't do funny business
I just ride in cars and watch them get hung up in it

I don't break hearts
I don't do funny business
I just ride cars and watch them get hung up in it
