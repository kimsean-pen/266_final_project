Where will I go?
When the only home I've known is ashes now, now
How will I know when the only love I'm shown is so changeable?
How do I grow then when I've been alive for the best part of my life?
Feeling alone
Feeling alone with you
Without you
With you
Without
With you
Without you
With you
Without
