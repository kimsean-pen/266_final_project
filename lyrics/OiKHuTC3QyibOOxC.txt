There was a time when the sky
Held the answers for the things I couldn't find,
But what happens when you're blind?

A shooting star once said to me
That nothing's really what it seems
'You must make up your own mind'
Well I'll try this time

So I look to the world outside oh
All of a sudden, I'm eating my insides
The tiny words that break your heart,
They're breaking and entering
So I look but you're not by my side
Whatever happened to 'I would rather die'?
The things that make you fall apart
They're breaking and entering

And I never said I was right
Well I'm probably the one in the wrong
The voices are telling me I just can't always be this strong

And nothing feels right not right now
Like I've lost my mind somehow
I'm scaring myself

I don't know the girl in the mirror now
I'm burning up, I'm burning up
I don't know the girl in the mirror now
I'm burning up, I'm burning up,
Well I'm burning up

So I look to the world outside oh
All of a sudden, I'm eating my insides
The tiny words that break your heart,
They're breaking and entering
So I look but you're not by my side
Whatever happened to 'I would rather die'?
The things that make you fall apart,
They're breaking and entering
I'm burning up, I'm burning up.
They're breaking and entering
I'm burning up, I'm burning up.

Well how can you know?
How can you stay in control when all that you know is
Falling apart? Falling apart.
How can you know?
How can you stay in control when all that you know is
Falling apart? Falling apart.
I'm burning up, I'm burning up
I don't know the girl in the mirror now.
I'm burning up, I'm burning up,
Well I'm burning up

So I look to the world outside oh
All of a sudden, I'm eating my insides
The tiny words that break your heart,
They're breaking and entering
So I look but you're not by my side
Whatever happened to 'I would rather die'?
The things that make you fall apart
They're breaking and entering
I'm burning up, I'm burning up
They're breaking and entering
I'm burning up, I'm burning up
They're breaking and entering
I'm burning up, I'm burning up
They're breaking and entering
I'm burning up, I'm burning up
You're breaking and entering.
