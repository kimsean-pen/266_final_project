Ooh - baby in blue jeans
I never thought I'd feel so alive

Ooh - baby in blue jeans
I never thought I'd feel so alive

I've seen you all'right
I've seen your fear
Like you just might die

I never saw you allright
Flying in my tide
I just never seen you cry

Ooh - baby in blue jeans
I never thought I'd feel so alive

Ooh - baby in blue jeans
I never thought I'd feel so alive

I've seen you all'right
I've seen your fear
Like you just might die

I never saw you allright
Flying in my tide
I just never seen you cry
