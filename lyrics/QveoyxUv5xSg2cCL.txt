You leave me
You leave me angry

the green, green grass
the gray, gray house
the green, green grass
the gray, gray house

the damage done
ascended the sky

oh rivers
rivers

And father's house
is full of arrows
he picked the scabs
now wounds will fester
a state of terror

the green, green grass
the gray, gray house
the green, green grass
the gray, gray house
oh rivers
rivers

the gentle breeze
we are at ease

lying there
You are near
lying there
You are near
