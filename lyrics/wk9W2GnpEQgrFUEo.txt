Long ago I swore an oath to levitate my soul
Above the things that seal me,
Those trying to deceive me.
I AM RISING!
I fought on psychic wars, the raids of mind control.
I closed my ears to sirens,
Their song I killed with silence.
I AM RISING!

On fields of mist, with thoughts from gold
I am rising as a Sun.

I AM RISING!

Destiny, Victory., are giving me their wings.
Not gone... I am still alive,
Through Will and strong desire. I am rising!

I fought on many wars and bled and cried and lost.
But I kept fighting on, until I reached my goal.

I AM RISING!

Destiny, Victory, have healed my broken wings.
Not gone... I am still alive,
Through Will and strong desire.

I AM RISING!
