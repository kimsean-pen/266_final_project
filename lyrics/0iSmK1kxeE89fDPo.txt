Some people like to rock
Some people like to roll
Movin' and groovin's gonna satisfy my soul

Let's have a party, let's have a party
Send him to the store
And buy some more
Let's have a party tonight

I never kissed a bear
I never kissed a goon
But I can shake a chicken in the middle of the room

Let's have a party, let's have a party
Send him to the store
And buy some more
Let's have a party tonight

I never kissed a bear
I never kissed a goon
But I can shake a chicken in the middle of the room
