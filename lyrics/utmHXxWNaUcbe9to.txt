I've reached the end and I don't know
What I believe in anymore.
There's something crazy running wild inside my brain.
I've seen the truth become my lie.
Bit my tongue, swallowed my pride.
I've crossed the line and I know there's no turning back.

You kiss away all of my pain,
You wash away these bloody stains
You are to blame, my suffering.
(MY, MY, MY SUFFERING!)
You kiss away all of my pain,
You wash away these bitter stains
You are to blame, my suffering.
(MY, MY, MY SUFFERING!)

I've seen the devil in a smile
Abomination in a vile.
My happy ending exists only in my dreams...

You kiss away all of my pain,
You wash away these bloody stains
You are to blame, my suffering.
(MY, MY, MY SUFFERING!)
You kiss away all of my pain,
You wash away these bitter stains
You are to blame, my suffering.
(MY, MY, MY SUFFERING!)

MY SUFFERING!
You kiss away all of my pain,
You wash away these bloody stains
You are to blame, my suffering.
(MY, MY, MY SUFFERING!)
You kiss away all of my pain,
You wash away these bitter stains
You are to blame, my suffering.

You kiss away all of my pain,
You wash away these bloody stains
You are to blame, my suffering.

(MY, MY,) MY SUFFERING!
