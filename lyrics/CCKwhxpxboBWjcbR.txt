In my wildest dreams
I wouldn't feel all this sins
But the weight on my shoulders is to much to bare
In my wildest dreams
I wouldn't feel all this sins
But the weight on my shoulders is to much to bare
So I walked to the river and I carry it there
You have controlled me, my joy in your hands
You're the ghost in my footprints
The snake in the sand
But life is much bigger and it's taking me...
It's taking me home just like a river close to the sea...
Just like river passing through me...
Just like river feeding my soul...
Like a river taking me home...

I cry as I push you deep down in the water
I see your face twisting, your eyes lose their laughter
The water will take you away from me now
There's space in the shadows I've chosen to stay
Don't struggle with me it's much easier this way
We've danced for so long but let go it's ok...
'Cus I'm going home...
Just like a river close to the sea...
Just like river passing through me...
Just like river feeding my soul...
Like a river taking me home...
Taking me home...
Taking me home...
Taking me home...
It's taking me!

Like a river close to the sea...
Like river passing through me...
Just like river feeding my soul...
Like a river taking me home...
