Pour your gasoline
I can make you bleed without touching, baby
I am just a bitch, filthy, dirty witch
You all call me crazy
Forever in a blur, easily disturbed
Pick me like a daisy
Go ahead and burn, go and take your turn
Light me right 'round baby

Man is burning me
God damn, they're hurting me
Witch hunt, witch hunt
Witch hunt, witch hunt
Witch hunt, witch hunt

Animal of love
They all look above for one almost maybe
Pretty girl is on, throwing her baton
Living straight 180
I will never be prettier than she
So I like it rainy
Caught up with the man
With my dyed red hands
Electrotherapy

Man is burning me
God damn, they're hurting me
Witch hunt, witch hunt
Witch hunt, witch hunt
Witch hunt, witch hunt
Witch hunt

My heart will burn in the ashes with all incivility
Why cry, I move from the star with my invisibility
My heart has been beat and bruised since you been killing me
Why cry, throw the match back, turn, close your eyes
Burn, burn, burn

Man is burning me
God damn, they're hurting me
Man is burning me
God damn, they're hurting me
Man is burning me, God damn
Pour your gasoline
I can make you bleed without touching, baby
