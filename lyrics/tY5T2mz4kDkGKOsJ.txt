I am crazy, mad, insane
Out of my brain
I am all the things you hate
Crazy

You build your kingdom of hypocrisy
And then you tried to name it honesty
I bear the burden of the blame
That you poured on me

I am crazy, mad, insane
Out of my brain
I am all the things you hate

You hide your guilt
And act like god damn saint
Tell me to staiy away
And fix my brain
You twisted truth
But that is only gonna feed the flame

I am crazy, mad, insane
Out of my brain
I am all the things you hate

Force in to a puzzle
Where I can not fit
I won't be like you
'Cause you make me sick
A little freak that needs to trash
That you won't say it's true
Fuck you!

I am crazy, mad, insane
Out of my brain
I am all the things you hate

I am crazy, mad, insane
Out of my brain
I am all the things you hate

I am crazy, mad, insane
Out of my brain
I am all the things you hate
