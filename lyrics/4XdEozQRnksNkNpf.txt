It is ok
To run to the fields and look for anything
All the daffodils are pretty anyway
It is all right
To envy the birds flying heart to heart singing
All the songs about their happy nesting

Close your eyes and breathe
Close your eyes and let it come to you naturally
Just close your eyes and wait
Somebody will find you someday
And take you places

It was so great
You woke up next to the player once again
And you heard the same false cheesy lines from him
It was so nice
Thought you found something but you will keep on looking
For the fulfillment for what is missing

And it hurts so much cause you feel that you're the only one who's left alone
Don't look for them don't try so hard cause you're the one who will be found

Close your eyes and breathe
Close your eyes and let it come to you naturally
Just close your eyes and wait
Somebody will find you someday
And take you to places
