I don't even recognise
when I look into your eyes
all that I can ever see
is trouble hanging over me
trouble, trouble, trouble hanging over me
trouble, trouble, trouble's all I ever see
I got a pain on my hear and pain on my chest
I wanna be human again
I got a pain in my head and I'm losing my breath,
I wanna be human again, human again
human again, human again, I wanna be human again
I can feel it in my bones
I don't wanna die alone
When all I ever get is rain
Help me see the sun again
I can see the change in me
Makes me feel alive again
I got a pain on my hear and pain on my chest
I wanna be human again
I got a pain in my head and I'm losing my breath,
I wanna be human again, human again
Human again, human again
I wanna be human again
I'll keep on flying and I'll keep on trying
And I know there's a light in the dark
