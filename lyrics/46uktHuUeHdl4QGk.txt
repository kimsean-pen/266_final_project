I wrote a song for America they told me it was clever,
Jessica's gone on vacation on the dark side of town forever.
Who knew? Who knew?

Winter, spring, summer and fall,
Animals crawl, towards death's embrace.
Winter, spring, summer, fall, punks kick a ball!
In a park, on a Sunday, strung out in the rain!

Winter, spring, summer and fall,
Animals crawl, towards death's embrace.
Winter, spring, summer, fall, punks kick a ball!
In a park, on a Sunday, just wasted in the rain!

Winter, spring, summer and fall,
Animals crawl, towards death's embrace.
Winter, spring, summer, fall, punks kick a ball!
In a bar, on a Sunday, strung out in the rain!
