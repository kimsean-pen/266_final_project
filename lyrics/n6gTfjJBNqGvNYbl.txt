I love your loving arms
They hold a world of charms
A place to nestle
When I am lonely
A cozy morris chair
What kind of chair
Is a maurice chair?
One caress, happiness
Seems to bless my little honey
I love him more each day
When years have passed away
He'll find my love
Belongs to him only!

'Cause when the world seems wrong
He'll know that I belong
Right in my honey's loving arms
I love him more each day
When years have passed away
He'll find my love
Belongs to him only!

'Cause when the world seems wrong
He will know that I belong
Right in my honey's loving arms
I said my honey 's loving
I mean my honey's loving arms
I mean my honey's loving arms . . .
