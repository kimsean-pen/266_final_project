I'm renting a room
You can see the moon
In a factory yard at night
And the bells ring Sunday
Practice on Monday
Never seem to get it right

Weekend lovers snugging in a phone box
Hear Sunday church bells
Terraced houses very near the railway

Hear Sunday church bells
Ah

Does an angel kiss like a cymbal splash
Do I tear myself away

Its a dangerous time
Near the railway line
For the boy who came to stay

Weekend lovers snugging in a phone box
Hear Sunday church bells
Terraced houses very near the railway
Hear Sunday church bells
Englishman he's walking on the high street
Hears Sunday church bells
Radical longhair going for the papers
Hears Sunday church bells
Ah
Lorry driver going to the station
Hears Sunday church bells
Crazy children playing on a scateboard
Hear Sunday church bells
Lonely laurence waiting for a phonecall
Hears Sunday church bells
Me and annabel lying in a big bed
Hear Sunday church bells
Ah...
