Yeah I was sitting in the back
Smell of cigarettes and air in the summer
Yeah you were yelling at the sky,
Hair blowing back; I think this is freedom

Thank you for a reason to stay, stay
I could have gone home with regrets
But that's just how it is
Thank you for an obvious sign
That you'd go to these great lengths,
While I'm behind you

Yeah I was sitting in the back
Pretending not to listen to your conversation
yeah you were trying not to cry
Telling him the reasons that you had to leave him

Thank you for a reason to stay, stay
I could have gone home with regrets.
But that's just how it is
Thank you for an obvious sign.
That you'd go to these great lengths,
While I'm behind you.
