Hey! I'm only fourteen
Sickly 'n' thin
Tried all of my life
Just to grow me a chin
It popped out once
But my dad pushed it in
Why did he hurt me?
He's my next of kin...
He's a mex-i-kin

I'm lonely 'n' green
Too small for my shirt
If Simmons was here
I could feature my hurt
Scared of the future
Hope I don't grow
I know nobody likes me
'Cause everywhere I go
They say NO
They say NO
They say NO

Now I'm older
Got a place in the town, babe
Got a chin on my shoulder
'N' it keeps growing down 'n' down 'n' down
I'm horny 'n' lonely
'N' I wish I was dead
Why am I livin'?
I wanna be dead instead
That's right, I said
I wanna be dead instead
Now dig this:

I wanna be dead
In bed
Please kill me
'Cause that would thrill me
I wanna be dead
In bed
Please kill me
'Cause that would thrill me
(etc, repeat)
