Martyrs of the cross, bear the flames of hate
The madness in their eyes is blind to their obsession
The judgments they bestow... in God's name

Abolish the impious, conquering their fate
Driven by beliefs they enforce upon the weak
to justify the life... they've destroyed.

For control of the soil, sacred grounds of faith
Soaking in the blood, the blood of their redemption
Longing for deliverance... from sin

Apostles of perversion, the suffering they induce
Thrive upon the carnage, take pleasure in their pain
They offer no atonement... for they're his chosen

Take the weak... Make them see
Our blessed ways... Died for God

Sickening... Benevolence
Twisted... Conviction

On the shores of Armageddon, the defeated bow their heads
Silent are their prayers, silent are the heavens
Their somber eyes have seen the coming of the beast.

Behold the loss of life and the triumphs of death
The fall of man and God, a penance for devotion
Feel the fury of his everlasting retribution
