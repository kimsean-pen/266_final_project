Wanted, for my time spent, searching for the world
I receive, all I ever dream for in return all is taken away!
I remember everything before tonight
I remember everything before tonight

These illusions that life is so clear
Have been cleansed for my thoughts
Floating branches are the only things, truly connected to the ground!

Take me back, to how it used to be!
I'll never close my eyes again!
How could I, ever forget a place like this?
Somewhere that I can call my own
My eyes, will only see, what I'm supposed to be!

Take me back to how it used to be
I'll never close my eyes again
How could I, ever forget a place like this?
Somewhere that I can call my own!

This is satisfaction in its most, beautiful state
Beautiful state

Surrounding me, is everything, that is true!
Just let this be true, let this be!
I won't forget, this place!
I won't forget, this is my own!
I won't forget, open my eyes!
I won't forget, I won't forget!
