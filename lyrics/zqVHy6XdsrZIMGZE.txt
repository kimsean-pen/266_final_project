My northern heart weighs like a stone
and the burning sadness has become my home
the tortured world wants me to hate
but there's the world inside
my love can bury my rage

Every second I disappear
I feel my senses dying
in the mountain's stillness I hear
Hollywood coyotes crying

Sorrow, you are my light
everything my heart desires
show me your beautiful anger
sorrow, keeping me sane
you turn my nights into days
I love your beautiful anger

When I am tempted to give up
and the winter's drowning me with memories and loss
I leave my hungry mind outside
'cause there's a beauty inside
and sorrow is fueling my fire

Every second I disappear
I feel my senses dying
in the mountain's stillness I hear
Hollywood coyotes crying

Sorrow, you are my light

everything my heart desires
show me your beautiful anger
sorrow, keeping me sane
you turn my nights into days
I love your beautiful anger
anger
anger

Every time that I feel
my empire beneath my feet
crumbling
anger
crumbling

Sorrow...
you turn my nights into days
sorrow...

Anger
anger
