With a face like this I won't break any hearts
And thinking like that I won't make any friends

Screw that, forget about that
I don't wanna think about anything like that
Screw that, forget about that
I don't wanna know about anything like that

I've got nothing to do but hang around and get screwed up on you
I've got nothing to do but hang around and get screwed up on you

Your beauty makes me feel alone
I look inside but no ones home

Screw that, forget about that
I don't wanna think about anything like that
Screw that, forget about that
I don't wanna know about anything like that

I've got nothing to do but hang around and get screwed up on you
I've got nothing to do but hang around and get screwed up on you

- Guitar solo -

I've got nothing to do but hang around and get screwed up on you
I've got nothing to do but hang around and get screwed up on you
I've got nothing to do but hang around and get screwed up on you
I've got nothing to do but hang around and get screwed up on you

But get screwed up on you
But get screwed up on you
