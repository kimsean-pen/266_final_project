Great love setting the world on fire
I am in awe of who You are
And it's Your love I'm living for

Can't you feel I'm drawing near
The place that broke your heart
Cut up and scarred
The dawn is breaking
My body's shaking
Oh, the secret memories you keep
Ignoring the soul that you can sleep
I'm facing what you won't tonight
The dawn is breaking
My body's shaking

Great love setting the world on fire
I am in awe of who You are
And it's Your love I'm living for
Great love filling me up inside
You are the one I'm looking for
And I am Yours forevermore

There I was awaiting death for you
And all I did was love you too
I'm facing what you won't tonight
The dawn is breaking
My body's shaking

Great love setting the world on fire
I am in awe of who You are
And it's Your love I'm living for
Great love filling me up inside
You are the one I'm looking for
And I am Yours forevermore

There I was awaiting death for you
And all I did was love you too

Great love setting the world on fire
I am in awe of who You are
And it's Your love I'm living for
Great love filling me up inside
You are the one I'm looking for
And I am Yours forevermore
You are the one I'm looking for
And I am Yours forevermore
And I am Yours forevermore
