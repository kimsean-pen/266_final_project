As I lay my head down
upon that grassy field
winter's passing
Snowfall.
no one will ever know.
the end.
the end is holy.

As I lay my head down
upon that grassy field
you won't find me
I'm alone.
No one will ever know.

oh, look at the years going by.
no, troubles come into your life.
oh, now that you finally have found the end.

the end.
the end is holy.
