You make me a pool
Where you dip-dive in it
You and a fool in it
Wasn't a waterbed but it was one where you been in
Left makeup stains all over the place
But I look good with a smile on my face

Lordy, lordy, lordy, oh
Oh, we're spiritual
So spiritual
When you were evolving
Ooh, in my physical
Felt spiritual

Let's just run that one more time
I want it back to back just one more time
Make me spill all of my expensive wine
Yeah, I want all of that just one more time

Wake me back up
And I'm still floating yeah
Skin still soaking wet
You're making miracles 'cause you're walking on water yeah
In this king bed
California, yeah
I could do all of this again, again

Lordy, lordy, lordy
Ooh, we're spiritual
So spiritual
When you were a evolving
Ooh, in my physical
Felt spiritual

Let's just run that one more time
I want it back to back just one more time
Make me spill all of my expensive wine
Yeah, I want all of that just one more time

Lordy, lordy, lordy
Almost makes me emotional
Your physical
You come close to hold me
And this feels like a ritual
Ooh, so sensual

Let's just run that one more time
I want it back to back just one more time
Make me spill all of this expensive wine
Yeah, I want all of that just one more time

One more time
One more time
One more time
I said one more time
Make me spill all of this expensive wine
Yeah, I want all of that just one more time
(Run it back)
