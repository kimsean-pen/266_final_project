Violence in the air, clocked out stares
We're just window-shopping
Won't you dance with me
I'm gonna knock you down
Have you afterhours

To many sherbert dips
You'll get licked if you carry on this way
Beautiful punch bag
I'm gonna lay you down
Just call me Mr. Brown

I'm not that kind of man in the day
Won't you hold me steady
Spectacular rival
I've had my medicine
Although you're not my friend
I'll love you to the end

Either way, heavens got a place for me
Your majesty, why you got it in for me
Either way, heavens got a place for me
Your majesty, why you got it in for me

Either way, heavens got a place for me
Your majesty, why got it in for me
Either way, heavens got a place for me
Your majesty, why you got it in for me
