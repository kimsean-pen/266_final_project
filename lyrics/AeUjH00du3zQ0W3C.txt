Aight fuck that, word word
Lord Finnesse, Jay O its been my jail since a day old
Yea this ones for the ladies who be tryna have my baby
Ayo word to my mother, two things I never do is leave the crib without some rubbers or tell a funky ho I love her
These broads be trying to get a brother caught up in a sticky situation, missing menstruation cycles
They all psycho ask Micheal before you get a note from billie jean in them nice
clothes like whoa dont let them trap you on the tight rope spike holes in the condom to form a zygote overnight ask quan he know what its like he wore a
hat but it exploded twice
but fuck a bad bitch I do this rap shit and put it over life
on the coldest nights son shine like a solar strike
And I swear I swear I got the weirdest cases
chicks in the weirdest places from rooftops to staircase, like get a load of dead faces,
face it if you fear hate it you get put into this clear space
I dont trust these bitches they would never catch me slippin
Hey yo, I'm attached too, to the cash rules
About to go nuts niggas get their attitudes
To these cash you
Who you know that cool that they drip swagoo
And I'm here to stay like tattoos on statues
Check your mirror nigga that's the second time
I passed you, eating my gas fume
Got me thinking I could gas you
And your girl got gas too
She let me tackle
before I touch and I staple
And as you decide to put her shackle
I'm that dude, fuck values
all up in the cut
No alchool just bad booze
Tryin to find the path to bring him back too
Like a taboo, that poo, got back chicks
Loosing 'til they back bones
Look it at my cock tip
Down and doin' all no matter what the synapsis is
All it takes is some exotic piff
And all your conscience tap exclusively vodka and shit
