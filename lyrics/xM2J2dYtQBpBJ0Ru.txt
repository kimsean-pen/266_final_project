You weigh on my mind
Like pieces of you stuck to me
And I needed time to be there
To feel myself move again

Whenever I want you
You are mine
Whenever you tell me
It's going to be fine

And I thought you were mine to be
And I thought you'd be good for me
But I know what you are now
And I know what you are now

And I thought you were onto me
And I thought you'd be good for me
But I know what you are now
And I know what you are now

In the mural room
Aligning the tapestry
Thousands of years spent
A missed opportunity

Whenever I want you
You are mine
Whenever you tell me
It's going to be fine

And I thought you were mine to be
And I thought you'd be good for me
But I know what you are now
And I know what you are now

And I thought you were onto me
And I thought you'd be good for me
But I know what you are now
And I know what you are now

Whenever I want you
You are mine
Whenever you tell me
It's going to be fine

And I thought you were mine to be
And I thought you'd be good for me
But I know what you are now
And I know what you are now

And I thought you were onto me
And I thought you'd be good for me
But I know what you are now
And I know what you are now

And I thought you were mine to be
And I thought you'd be good for me
But I know what you are now
And I know what you are now

And I thought you were onto me
And I thought you'd be good for me
But I know what you are now
And I know what you are now
