Wait 'till you see him
See how he looks
Wait 'till you see him
Wait till you hear him laugh
Painters of paintings
Writers of books
Never could tell the half
Wait 'till you see him
See how he looks
Wait 'till you see him
See how he looks
Wait 'till you see him
Wait till you hear him laugh
Wait till you feel
The warmth of his glance
Pensive and sweet and wise
All of it lovely, all of it thrilling
I'll never be willing to free him
When you see him
You won't believe your eyes
You won't believe, you won't believe
Your eyes, your eyes
Wait 'till you see him
You won't believe your eyes
You won't believe, you won't believe
Your eyes
