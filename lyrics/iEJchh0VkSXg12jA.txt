Ivy growing up on the bleeding walls
Every leaf a breath of the story
Autumn and the all fall down
Now I'm seeing clearly how
Heavy is our glory

Because I won't find it
There's no one quite like you
And I still hold on entangled in your roots
Just like I was fifteen summers young
And I closed my eyes I knew you'd come
As I imagined someone like, someone like, like you
Someone like you
So tell me where the nomad wanders on
Is it in a world untraveled?
Is it where the music plays?
Filling up the empty space
It's where you left me fragile

Because I won't find it
There's no one quite like you
And I still hold on entangled in your roots
Just like I was fifteen summers young
And I closed my eyes I knew you'd come
As I imagined someone like, someone like, like you
Someone like you
Someone like
Someone like you
Someone like
Someone like you
Because I won't find it
There's no one quite like you
And I still hold on entangled in your roots
Just like I was fifteen summers young
And I closed my eyes I knew you'd come
As I imagined someone like, someone like, like you
