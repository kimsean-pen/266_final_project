Say you see through the folly
But you do it for the fame
And I'm fighting the jetstream
Drinking cheap wine on airplanes
You're in L.A., not Chicago
Key under mat
I walk the dog, order in
Home alone

Found your letter on a full moon Sunday night
Some other girl in your spell, casting plans for her life
Pour the vodka and it dulls sharp lies
Breathe the words of diamonds on rings

And you didn't mean to do it
So I don't have to believe it
If you didn't really mean it
The magical thinking gets us by

Sing for the after show
Those candy-colored lips
Your age is showing and you've gotta work harder for it
It's always easier with freshmen
I'm not as clever, it should bring you to life

And you didn't mean to do it
So I don't have to believe it
If you didn't really mean it
The magical thinking gets us by

My fairweather friend

Live for the folly, but you did it for the fame
Now you're fragile as porcelain
Drinking cheap wine on airplanes
Did I ever leave Chicago?
I got your message
Glad you're doing well

And you didn't mean to do it
So I don't have to believe it
If we didn't really mean it
The magical thinking gets us by

Gets us by
Gets us by

Say you see through the folly
But you did it for the fame
Say you see through the folly
But you did it for the fame
Say you see through the folly
But you did it for the fame
Say you see through the folly
But you did it for the fame

My fairweather friend
