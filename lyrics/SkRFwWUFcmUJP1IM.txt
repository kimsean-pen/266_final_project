Flesh is foreign, friends are far
Decks run deep, sleep is minster marred
And it's all out war for the soul between
Dreams that are hungry and the fears that feed
But I'll carry it, my chariot, through blood and bros
Under scarlet skies of fire, into great unknown
Living on the lam and the frontier of
Free life of free will for the thrill of your love

Spill your secrets and peak my days
Passion is your palette, your canvases caf√©s
And all my nights in the harbor and hell
Of the cantina's counsel and meals of mescal

Plans to settle down
Plans to up and split
Plans loose as the morals we are planning with
Baby be the beast, but free what burdens be
And I'll love you 'cause you love me

All life long, 'til I'm gone
All life long, 'til I'm gone

Cigarettes, sorcery, and Biblical sins
Hang over us heathens, harlots, and anti-heroines
The cabarets, the getaways, and the afterglow
A little money and whatever's on the radio

Plans to settle down
Plans to up and split
Plans loose as the morals we are planning with
Baby be the beast, but free what burdens be
And I'll love you 'cause you love me

All life long, 'til I'm gone
All life long, 'til I'm gone
All life
All life
All life
All life
All life long, 'til I'm gone
All life long, 'til I'm gone
