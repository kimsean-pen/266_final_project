Babe
There's something tragic about you
Something so magic about you
Don't you agree

Babe
There's something lonesome about you
Something so wholesome about you
Get closer to me.

No tired sigh, no rolling eyes
No irony
No 'who cares', no vacant stare
No time for me

Honey you're familiar
Like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison
Chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming

Honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden
Just to sit outside your door

Babe
There's something wretched about this
Something so precious about this
Where to begin

Babe
there's something broken about this
But I might be hoping about this
Oh what a sin

To the strand, a picnic planned for you and me
A rope in hand, for your other man
To hang from a tree

Honey you're familiar
Like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison
Chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming

Honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden
Just to sit outside your door

Honey, you're familiar
Like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison
Chilvary fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming

Honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden
Just to hide outside your door
