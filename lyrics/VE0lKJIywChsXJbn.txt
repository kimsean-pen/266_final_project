I haven't picked up in over two weeks
I'm living in the spaces in between
The less room I have to feel
What I really feel

I'm trying to let go
Of the things I used to think that you should know
'Cause I want to be free
From the hurt that I caused you to cause me

I am a liar and a freak
So what?
I'm just like everybody else
I do fucked up things in my dreams
So what?
I'm just like everybody else

I'm gonna bend until I break
And I'm gonna make a bunch of mistakes
'Cause I am doing whatever it takes
To get over you

I'm trying to let go
Of the things I used to think that you should know
'Cause I want to be free
From the hurt that I caused you to cause me

I'm a liar and a freak
So what?
I'm just like everybody else
I do fucked up things in my dreams
So what?
I'm just like everybody else

I will never be good enough
Good enough for you
But I'm already good enough for me
I will never be good enough for you
But I'm already good enough for me
