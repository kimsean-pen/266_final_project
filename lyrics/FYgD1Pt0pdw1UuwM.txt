Stay, until your session starts
You know I'm trying to, but I can't sell
The solidarity that we tried to make
'Cause there's things you can't shake
And you bust your head, spill into your hands
I saw you show, your scars to people you don't know
They say that they've got the fix but it might make it worse
Hold the nail and drive it in
Drive it in

You don't have to twist my arm
Don't want to say that I just want the way you are
'Cause I know that I'm being selfish
I know you're trapped in your head when your drinks spilt outside and we sit in my car
And I'm afraid that they will change you
But if that's what you want then I guess I want it too
And I'm afraid that they will change you
But if that's what you want then I guess I want it too
Oh, I guess I want it too

Opened windows
So long as the door has been locked
Old willow
Twisting your limbs into knots
Pathetic
Thought I could keep you until
Your headaches
Rest in the garden we built
You don't have to twist my arm

Don't want to say that I just want the way you are
'Cause I know that I'm being selfish
I know you're trapped in your head when your drinks spilt outside and we sit in my car
And I'm afraid that they will change you
But if that's what you want then I guess I want it too
And I'm afraid that they will change you
But if that's what you want then I guess I want it too
Oh, I guess I want it too

You don't have to twist my arm
Don't want to say that I just want the way you are
'Cause I know that I'm being selfish
I know you're trapped in your head when your drinks spilt outside and we sit in my car
And I'm afraid that they will change you
But if that's what you want then I guess I want it too
And I'm afraid that they will change you
But if that's what you want then I guess I want it too
Oh, I guess I want it too
