if you think i'm moving righteous then
i think i'm moving backwards and
i feel you dancing in my chest
it's kind of hurting
and by the way I drag my head
you think i would be grounded and
i would consider severing
to lose the friction

i don't require you to step out side of yourself
my lazy death in front of me had all the time to sigh with ease
and oh i know it'll break my knees

achieved inside of one night's work
i stumbled and began this lurk
it's something of an aimless sort

i don't require you to step out side of yourself
my lazy death in front of me had all the time to sigh with ease
and oh i know it'll break my knees
