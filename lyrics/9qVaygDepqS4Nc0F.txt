How much would you bet
that if I tried hard enough
I would spontaneously combust?

I wish I could disappear
and run away from all of my fears.
I think I'm coming undone.

So stay the night.
I promise that I won't bite.
'cause without you there,
I don't think I can close my eyes.

How did I end up this way?
A constant knot in my gut,
tied with uncertainty and with lust.

A classic case, I suppose,
a haunted man who can't outrun his ghosts.
They're in my skin and my bones.

So stay the night.
I promise that I won't bite.
'cause without you there,
I don't think I can close my eyes.

And now I sing.
