Who draws the crowd, who plays so loud, baby, it's the guitar man
Who's gonna steal the show, you know, baby, it's the guitar man
He can make you love, he can make you cry
He will bring you down, he will get you high
And something keeps him going miles and miles away
To find another place to play

Night after night, who treats you right, baby, it's the guitar man
Who's on the radio, you know, baby, it's the guitar man
When he comes to town and you see his face
And you think you might like to take his place
Something keeps him drifting miles and miles away
Searching for the songs to play

Then you listen to the music and you'd like to sing along
And you want to get the meaning out of each and every song
And you find yourself a message and some words to call your own and take 'em home

He can make you love, he can get you high
He will bring you down, then he'll make, make you cry
Something keeps him moving, but no one seems to know
What it is that makes him go

Then the lights begin to flicker and the sound is getting dim
The voice begins to falter and the crowds are getting thin
But he never seems to notice, he's just got to find another place to play

Fade away (Ah, ah)
Got to play (Ah, ah)
Fade away (Ah, ah)
Got to play (Ah, ah)
(Ah, ah)
(Ah, ah)
(Ah, ah)
(Ah, ah)
