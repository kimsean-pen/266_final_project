Memories, pressed between
The pages of my mind
Memories, sweetened through
The ages just like wine

Quiet thoughts come floating

Down and settle softly to the ground
Like golden autumn leaves
Around my feet
I touched them and they
Burst apart with sweet memories
Sweet memories

Of holding hands and red bouquets
And twilights trimmed in purple haze
And laughing eyes and simple ways
And quiet nights and
Gentle days with you

Memories, pressed between
The pages of my mind
Memories, sweetened
Through the ages just like wine
Memories, memories

Of holding hands and red bouquets
And twilights trimmed in purple haze
And laughing eyes and simple ways
And quiet nights and gentle days with you

Memories, pressed between
The pages of my mind
Memories, sweetened
Through the ages just like wine
Memories, memories,
Sweet memories, memories
