Flying over the sun, escaping with a singed ass-feather
Crazy bird, plunging fast toward the concrete nether
Death defying
Ain't think much of trying
Just flying

Low
Low flying bird
Don't scrape your beak
Low flying bird, don't sink
Let me ride
Over the canyon wide
Let me ride
Low flying bird, don't dive

A bird called Where, searching for her dismembered love
Lighting stricking all around, traveling from the way above
Boy that's looks like fun
Until the day is done
Fly

Low
Low flying bird
Don't scrape your beak
Low flying bird, don't sink
Let me ride
Over the canyon wide
Let me ride
Low flying bird, don't dive

All my dreams I'd burn to fly
Wind falling out the clear sky
Mistle and a kiss goodbye
