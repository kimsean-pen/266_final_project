Some of us, We're hardly ever here
The rest of us, we're born to disappear
How do I stop myself from
Being just a number

How will I hold my head
To keep from going under
Down to the wire
I wanted water but
I'll walk through the fire

If this is what it takes
To take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do

When the world keeps
Testing me, testing me, testing me
How did they find me here
What do they want from me
All of these vultures hiding

Right outside my door
I hear them whisperin
They're tryin' to ride it out
They've never gone this long

Without a kill before
Down to the wire
I wanted water but
I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes

To take me even higher

Then I'll come through
Like I do
When the world keeps

Testing me, testing me, testing me
(solo)
Wheels up
I got to leave this evening
Can't seem to shake these vultures
Off of my trail
Powers is made, by power being taken
I keep on running
To protect my situation
Down to the wire
I wanted water but
I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes
To take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do
When the world keeps
Testing me, testing me, testing
Oooooooooooo
Oooooooooooo
Oooooooooooo
Oooooooooooo
Whatcha gonna do about it
Whatcha gonna do about it
Whatcha gonna do 'bout it
Don't give up, give up
Don't give up, give up, give up
Don't give up, give up
Don't give up, give up, give up
