Tonight, we're washing off the blood.
Tonight, tonight.
And I've tried to give you what you want
What is it that you want?
Day spent with not a word to say
Routine, red lie.
So jump, we'll sit and burn a lie
We'd rather burn than fight.
But I ain't gonna be here too long, too long
No I ain't gonna be here too long, too long
No I ain't gonna be here too long, too long
We've become so good at fooling all

We think twice and always turn around,
A comfortable frown
So jump but sit and burn a lie
There's no wrong, no right.
And I ain't gonna be here too long, too long
No I ain't gonna be here too long, too long
No I ain't gonna be here too long, too long
No I ain't gonna be here too long, too long
No I ain't gonna be here too long, too long
