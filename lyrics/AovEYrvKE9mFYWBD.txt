Raise high monolithic statues, so fragile as they fall
I am ever enthralled
Gaze, lie and smirk in time, your arrogance will suit you well
Until fashion is dispelled

As waves of plastic fame go out of fashion
You're going out, going out forever unknown
These waves of plastic fame go out of fashion
You're going out, going out forever unknown

From above a rain of ashes descends
Anathema I will remain, forever will remain
From below, in my seclusion
Look up to the sky to see paper wings and watch them burn

Without habitation, you'll never find a soul inside
No life, but nothing's died
No lights, but quite the show, just as long as no one ever knows
All motion is pantomime

As waves of plastic fame go out of fashion
You're going out, going out forever unknown
These waves of plastic fame go out of fashion
You're going out, going out forever unknown

From above a rain of ashes descends
Anathema I will remain, forever will remain
From below, in my seclusion
Look up to the sky to see paper wings and watch them burn

Dancing in the rain of descending ash
Dancing on your grave, I'll see you all falling
Dancing in the rain of descending ash
Dancing in your dust, I'll see you all falling

I'd stop it, had you a heart
I'd stop it, had you a heart

From above a rain of ashes descends
Anathema I will remain, forever will remain
From below, in my seclusion
Look up to the sky to see paper wings and watch them burn
