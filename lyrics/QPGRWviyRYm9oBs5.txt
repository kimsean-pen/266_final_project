If I told you I was down I was down would you help me
Told you I was down I was down would you lift me up
I need your strength I'll be up someday
If I told you I was down I was down would you lift me up

I have this human love
It shattered once or twice
It pulls me up and down
If it's filled with jagged ice
Everyday I'm wanting something I ain't havin' mmhm mmhm
I have this human heart
My mother told me so
She said this shit can go to pieces boy be careful
But you and me and me and you got something magic mmhm
So I say to you

If I told you I was down I was down would you help me
Told you I was down I was down would you lift me up
I need your strength I'll be up someday
If I told you I was down I was down would you lift me up

If I told you I was broke I was broke would you fix me
Told you I was down to the line would you lift me up
I need your strength I'll be up someday
If I told you I was down I was down would you lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up

I have this human love
My mother told me so
She said this world could bring you down so don't be swinging low
Cause you and me and me and you got something magic mmhm
So I say to you

If I told you I was down I was down would you help me
Told you I was down I was down would you lift me up
I need your strength I'll be up someday
If I told you I was down I was down would you lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up

I got my problems but I don't need you to solve them and I don't care
Like it in that all my shit is right there
I wear my issues like tattoos across my chest
And people notice I tell them you ain't seen nothing yet
Brother lift me, brother lift me
Lift me up and be my strength I'll be up someday
If I told you I was down, I was down
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up

I got my problems but I don't need you to solve them and I don't care
Like it in that all my shit is right there
I wear my issues like tattoos across my chest
And people notice I tell them you ain't seen nothing yet
Brother lift me
