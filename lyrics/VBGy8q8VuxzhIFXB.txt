Go ahead and steal the shampoo
Take the road to
It's all about you, this weekend
We've been working too hard
Need a new start
Put it all in my car this weekend (weekend)

Stay in for the whole damn trip
Sleep in, let the phone line ring
I made us a reservation at the hottest place in town
But if you're down

All we're gonna have is room service
Stay up until fall
With a sign on the door saying
Please Don't disturb us (Oh oh)
Ain't no need to get dressed for some breakfast in bed
Just me and you, you, you, you
We're never gonna leave this room
Just me and you, you, you, you
And room service, room service

Go ahead and jump on the bead
Or jump me instead
Ain't seeing none of our friends
This weekend
Hell naw, we're staying cooped up
Staying boozed up
Movies are eighteen and up
So freaky, weekend

Stay in for the whole damn trip
Sleep in, let the phone line ring
I made us a reservation at the hottest place in town
But if you're down

All we're gonna have is room service
Stay up until fall
With a sign on the door saying
Please Don't disturb us (Oh oh)
Ain't no need to get dressed for some breakfast in bed
Just me and you, you, you, you
We're never gonna leave this room
Just me and you, you, you, you
And room service, room service

Stay in for the whole damn trip
Sleep in, let the phone line ring
We may never get around to seeing any of this town
But if you're down

All we're gonna have is room service
Stay up until fall
With a sign on the door saying
Please Don't disturb us (Oh oh)
Ain't no need to get dressed for some breakfast in bed
Just me and you, you, you, you
We're never gonna leave this room
Just me and you, you, you, you
And room service, room service

Your water runs dry
I'm fillin' up the cup
You're feelin' uptight
We loosen up your stuff
Whenever you're down
We get you on your feet
We're at your door like room service
Give you what you need

Your water runs dry
I'm fillin' up the cup
You're feelin' uptight
We loosen up your stuff
Whenever you're down
We get you on your feet
We're at your door like room service
Give you what you need

Your water runs dry
I'm fillin' up the cup
You're feelin' uptight
We loosen up your stuff
Whenever you're down
We get you on your feet
We're at your door like room service
At your door like room service
Give you what you need
