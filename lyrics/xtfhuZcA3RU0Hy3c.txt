Kylie give me
Kylie give me
Baby, you're the one that melts my heart
I swear I'm not lying
Maybe tonight I'm gonna try my luck
I can see that you want me
I'm dreaming about you every night
Every night
Kylie give me just a chance
Let's go out and dance
We can get into the groove
I can watch you move
Later you can sing to me
Like a shining star
But I rather nail you on the backseat of my car
Kylie give me just a chance
Let's go out and dance
We can get into the groove
I can watch you move
Later you can sing to me
Like a shining star
But I rather nail you on the backseat of my car
Baby, take a minute check me out
I sit in the frontrow
Baby I'm the coolest guy in the crowd
I'm sure you have seen me
I'm dreaming about you every night
every night
Kylie give me just a chance
Let's go out and dance
We can get into the groove
I can watch you move
Later you can sing to me
Like a shining star
But I rather nail you on the backseat of my car
Kylie give me just a chance
Let's go out and dance
We can get into the groove
I can watch you move
Later you can sing to me
Like a shining star
But I rather nail you on the backseat of my car
You drive me crazy
You slowly drive me crazy
Think about you baby
Can't get you out of my mind
I should be lucky
I should be so lucky
I should be lucky to sleep with you tonight
Kylie
Kylie
Kylie
Kylie give me just a chance
Let's go out and dance
We can get into the groove
I can watch you move
Later you can sing to me
Like a shining star
But I rather nail you on the backseat of my car
Kylie give me just a chance
Let's go out and dance
We can get into the groove
I can watch you move
Later you can sing to me
Like a shining star
But I rather nail you on the backseat of my car
