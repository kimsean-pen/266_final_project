Nothing's ever good enough
The weather's never cold enough
To drive me out

Chapter one needs to come
I have complained all morning
Now I can barely speak
There's a message inside that tells me
I will shed this skin I'll break free again

I've been searching for something
To keep me warm
To help me sleep at night
Come on
Is that a reward or a necessity?

Unplug the cord
Shuffle the cards
These ties have been tied too tightly
And I can barely breathe
Igloo mountains built high in the backyard
But all I see is melting

There's blood on my flannel
Courage in my flask
If we move onward
We'll never look back
