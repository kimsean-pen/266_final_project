Sorry, If I woke you up this morning; it was early.
The sun was coming up and I'd been drinking too much,
drinking too much.
Here I am, I'm just stumbling and I'm looking for a purpose,
I'm just gleaming and its coming to the surface,
too much.
Always thinking too much.
This conversation's getting boring,
I've given up and now I'm on the ground,
way too much.
Later on,
I awoke to find myself laid out in peices.
My mind's scattered and divided for no reason,
I don't know,
and its hurting so much.
Holding on,
I am grasping for some way to stop this feeling,
by replacing what I'm feeling, am I seeking,
too much?
Always thinking too much.
This conversations getting boring,
I've given up and now I'm on the ground.
I'm slowly sinking into nothing,
I've given up and now I'm on the ground,
way too much.
I sink like a stone;
just like you knew I would, babe,
knew I would, babe.
I sink like a stone;
just like you knew I would, babe,
knew I would, babe.
