Cody
Of all i knew
I held too few
And would you stop me?
If i tried to stop you?

Old songs, stay to the end
Sad songs, remind me of friends
And the way it is, i could leave it all
And i ask myself, would you care at all

When i drive alone at night
I see the streetlights as fairgrounds
And i tried a hundred times
To see the road signs as day-glow

Old songs, stay to the end
Sad songs, remind me of friends
And the way it is, i could leave it all
And i ask myself, would you care at all
