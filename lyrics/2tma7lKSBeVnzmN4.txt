Feeling your heartbeat heartbeat
Feeling your heartbeat heartbeat
Feeling your heartbeat heartbeat
Feeling your heartbeat heartbeat
Feeling your heartbeat heartbeat
Feeling your heartbeat heartbeat
Feeling your heartbeat heartbeat
Feeling your heartbeat heartbeat

Still trying to play this down
But I can't stay away from your side of town
And every kiss was like a drug
I could never resist
Now I can't get enough

Now I know i should let it go
How you're driving me wild everytime we hello
Remember friday nights dressed to thrill
Oh there still taking me down

Feel my heartbeat
Lost in a groove
Feel my heartbeat
It's making it move
Feel my heartbeat
Axis love is bold
Or Something just like this I am told

Everytime we said goodbye
It left me counting the counting the minutes
And chasing the high
God knows this feeling I can't fight
You got me so damn good, it don't seem right

It don't seem right

Feel my heartbeat
Lost in a groove
Feel my heartbeat
It's making it move
Feel my heartbeat
Axis love is bold
Or Something just like this I am told
How we're holding on these dreams together
Got a contact high from a kiss
Ride or die on forever
There's no surrender, without it, I can't live

Feel my heartbeat
Lost in a groove
Feel my heartbeat
It's making it move
Feel my heartbeat
Axis love is bold
Or Something just like this I am told

Wanna feel your heart beating
Wanna feel your heart beating
Wanna feel your heart beating
Wanna feel your heart beating
Wanna feel your heart beating
Wanna feel your heart beating
Wanna feel your heart beating
Wanna feel your heart beating
