Let me take you on, we'll get high just a little
Try to surface the calm, we don't come inside

Has it brought you closer to this?
Yeah, has it brought you closer to this?
And is it coming alive? Try to believe it
Was the question a point? I don't want your love
Has it brought you closer to this?
Yeah, has it brought you closer to this?

We've got eyes that leave us in places we don't see
We've got eyes that leave us in places we don't see

Let me take you on, we'll get high just a little
It kinda takes the joy away, we don't come at all
