The art of suicide
nightgowns and hair
Curls flying every which-way
The fate too pure to hide
Ridges of size
Meant to conceal lovers lies
Under the arches
of moonlight and sky
Suddenly easy
to contemplate why
Why

Why live a life
That's painted with pity and sadness and strife
Why dream a dream
That's tainted with trouble and less than it seems
Why bother bothering
Just for a poem or another sad song to sing
Why live a lie
Why live a lie
The art of suicide, gritty and clean
Conveys a theatrical scene
Alas, I've gone she cried

Veins displayed

Melodramatically laid
Under the arches
of moonlight and sky
Suddenly easy
to contemplate why
Why
Why live a life
That's painted with pity
and sadness and strife

Why dream a dream
That's tainted with trouble

and less than it seems
Why bother bothering
Just for a poem or another sad song to sing
Why live a lie
Why live a lie
Why live a life
That's painted with pity and sadness and strife
Why dream a dream
That's tainted with trouble and less than it seems

Why bother bothering
Just for a poem
or another sad song to sing

Why live a lie
Why live a lie
Why live a lie
Why live a lie
Life is not like a gloomy Sunday
With a second ending where the people are disturbed
Well they should be disturbed
Because there's a story that ought to be heard

Life is not like a gloomy Sunday
With a second ending where the people are disturbed
Well they should be disturbed
Because there's a lesson that really ought to be learned

The world is full of poets
We don't need any more
The world is full of singers
We don't need any more
The world is full of lovers
We don't need any more
