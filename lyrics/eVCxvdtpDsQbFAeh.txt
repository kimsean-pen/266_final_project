So you want to be alone
Run and hide inside your home

Watch you fall away from me
Sinking into misery

Taste your smile and hold my hand
Make you laugh and make you dance

I remember this
Everything was in our kiss

Sink my hands into the sea
Reach your fingers up to me

Trust me one more time
I can only try

Throw yourself to me
And I'll try to pull you free

Let me try to pull you free
Let me try to pull you free...
