I thought that I knew love
But it was just a wave crashing over us
In the breaths between the ones we meant to breathe
I had my head under my feet
You knew the way things were
You knew the way they would be
We knew exactly how it'd end
Strays on a stale sea
Oh anchored the engine to a canyon far beneath
Water rushed up from the boards below
So I started slickin' my hair with the kerosene
You knew the way things were
You knew the way they would be
We knew exactly how it'd end
Now I'm preparing for a burial at sea
But I can't see the lighthouse
Yeah I'm praying that these waters don't take me
Cause I can't see the lighthouse
I was screaming that the ship was sinking
But you were telling me to just keep drinking
Quartered into parts again
Arms and legs at the bottom of the ocean
And the thing that made it so much harder
Was the fact that you were someone's daughter
I knew the way things were
I know the way they would be
I knew exactly how it'd end
And I can't see the lighthouse
And I'm preparing for a burial at sea
But I can't see the lighthouse
Yeah I'm praying that these waters don't take me
Cause I can't see the lighthouse
Yeah I can't see the lighthouse
I thought that I knew love
But it was just a wave crashing over us
