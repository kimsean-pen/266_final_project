I love you in the morning, when the blood runs to your cheeks
Babe, you were the first thing and the last thing that I'd see
I was just a boy striking matches upon your heart
I couldn't get no sparks

Ask me to go faster, put my foot down to the floor
Standing at the edge, I feel like I've been here before
I loved you in the darkness and I loved you in fluorescent light
If it don't feel right, babe

You can run and hide, babe
Like a bird you can take flight
If I've been holding on too tight
If I've been holding on
Mmh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh

Your mother always told us we should go out to the dance
You can't get struck by lightning if your not standing in the rain
Take it as the truth or you can take it with a grain of salt
If it don't work out

You were in the shower, we were talking through the glass
Packing up your suitcase, you were humming to yourself
One day you were smiling, I could tell by how you sounded on the phone
You said "I'm coming home, babe"

I'm thinking 'bout coming home, babe
I'm thinking 'bout coming home, babe
I'm thinking 'bout coming home, babe
I'm thinking 'bout coming home

I'm thinking 'bout coming home
I'm thinking 'bout coming home
