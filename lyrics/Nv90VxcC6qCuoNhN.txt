Look what I've found
Come get down
It's that revolution sound
Call it second emancipation, break these chains and let me out

It's not violence I'm on about, but riot boots still hit the ground
Lower the gun put down the whip, take a step back hear me out
I am fanatic, employ guerrilla tactics
Open up this lyrical automatic and put holes in your rhetoric

It's archaic,
Kind of chaotic,
Almost barbaric,
But yet you stand and you swear by it

And I've been readily, steadily waiting for a chance to resist
The devil is a liar, topple the empire
Blood, sweat, tears and desire

I put my heart into this
Never forget I'm a soldier
I will not be conquered

I can't walk this road forever, and I can't forget the past
My soul is under pressure, and it's killing me
It's destroying me within, my need for emancipation
My soul is under pressure, and it's killing me

Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, equality and justice for all
Now you know you lying
You on that shotgun philosophy
Celebrate the tragedy

Build an effigy high to the heavens to remind me and blind me
Turn the whole world into my enemy
Control my destiny and drain all my energy
It's insane to me

Got the whole nation sedated and medicated,
A testimony to the violence,
Yet you still give me that ghetto education,
Basically priming me to feed me to the prison industry

I see all of you cowards, the greed, the need to hold control over me
Break these chains, end the power
I'd rather you give back what you stole from me

I can't walk this road forever, and I can't forget the past
My soul is under pressure, and it's killing me
It's destroying me within, my need for emancipation
My soul is under pressure, and it's killing me

Excuse me Mr. Officer,
Come out of my sector,
No need to stress,
No need for vex

Yo, excuse me your honor, fuck the drama
No apologies, I save that for my mama
Take my name off of the docket
Drop all these charges

All it took was a spark, all it took was a catalyst
Martin said it best,
I live a life with no violence,
So I speak up, no longer silent

I begin to see
My third eye is opening
My resolve is strengthening
I yearn to be free

I can't walk this road forever, and I can't forget the past
My soul is under pressure, and it's killing me
It's destroying me within, my need for emancipation
My soul is under pressure, and it's killing me

Excuse me Mr. Officer no need for war
Trying to drain my energy, but you can't keep me down
I can't walk this road forever, and I can't forget the past
My soul is under pressure, but it won't kill me.
