Any day can be
The last day in your life
So make an unforgettable time

Another sleepless night
And anxiety attacks
The doctor said you need some rest

But you're always on the run
Tracing after a place to hide

You were born to your mom
Shaking hands

Wolves are out tonight
And they're looking for a fight
'Cause they run at the speed of light
It seems you're home again

Don't forget to play
While time is running out
The clock tower in the window sky

Any day can be
The last day in your life
So make an unforgettable time

Around the blinking lights
From a giant neon sign
You were born in the wrong year

Your soul is freezing ice,
But still I'm, asking for a slice
You had to feed those monster hearts
And when you're home again

You feel you had enough, it's like the rising of the tide
You're a shadow just passing by
The wolves are out tonight
And they're looking for a fight
And they run at the speed of light
It seems you're home again
