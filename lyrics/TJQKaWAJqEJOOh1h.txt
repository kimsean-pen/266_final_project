What you want from me
Is all of my time wasting on you
Trying to teach me a lesson
But baby I don't want one thing from you
You can try to be in my head,
To be my beating heart
But with every time I love myself
It hurts your feelings

So, if I feel real good tonight
I'm gonna put it high on the loudspeaker up
And if I feel like crying I won't hide it,
I am the loudspeaker up

Why you done to me?
I see many other friendly signs thinking
That nobody could leave it
Baby you got another thing coming,
You can try to make me stop
Call it delusion
Every time I don't shut up,
It's revolution

So, if I feel real good tonight
I'm gonna put it high on the loudspeaker up
And if I feel like crying I won't hide it,
I am the loudspeaker up

I don't know where the blame lies,
But you better believe I am not gonna carry you
I know we're the shamed eyes
But it's telling me to scream this is not my fault!

I don't know where the blame lies,
But you better believe I am not gonna carry you
I know we're the shamed eyes
But it's telling me to scream this is not my fault!

I don't know where the blame lies,
But you better believe I am not gonna carry you
I know we're the shamed eyes
But it's telling me to scream this is not my fault!

If I feel real good tonight
I'm gonna put it high on the loudspeaker up
If I feel like crying I won't hide it,
I am the loudspeaker up
