You take the words right out of me
But it feels alright, to let this be

And I know what I want
But I know what I'll lose
Finding this is hard
Fighting this is new
Tell me why good things die
Stay the night

'Cause I need this more than I knew
More than I'd like, more than you do
'Cause I need this more than I knew
More than I'd like to

I say it hurts to know you'll leave
But I'm scared to show how much it means

And I know what I want
But I know what I'll lose
Finding this is hard
Fighting this is new
Tell me why good things die
Stay the night

'Cause I need this more than I knew
More than I'd like, more than you do
'Cause I need this more than I knew
More than I'd like to

'Cause I need this more than I knew
More than I'd like, more than you do
'Cause I need this more than I knew
More than I'd like
I do want you
