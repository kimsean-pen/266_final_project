It's Monday morning
And I would kill for a chance to drive
Get so far away from here with you my dear
That I'll never leave your side
Nobody knows the troubles I've seen
In a van, on a soapbox for the world to see

Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me
To be a monument for the rest of them
Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me
To be a monument for the rest of them

We're getting older
I've started to fear for my life
Is this the way that it should be?
This whole thing's riding on me

It's been a long road so far
With nowhere to turn
There's no looking back from here
No more dwelling on my fears

Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me
To be a monument for the rest of them
Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me
To be a monument for the rest of them

Twenty bucks says you'll remember me
When you see me on your TV screen
It may be the first time
But it won't be the last time

Twenty bucks says you'll remember me
When you see me on your TV screen
It may be the first time
But it won't be the last time

Twenty bucks says you'll remember me
When you see me on your TV screen
It may be the first time
But it won't be the last time

And I'll scream
So loud that everyone in this place
Will hear every word I say
Cause this is my time, this is my time to shine
Let nothing stand in our way

And I'll scream
So loud that everyone in this place
Will hear every word I say
Cause this is my time, this is my time to shine
Let nothing stand in our way

Twenty bucks says you'll remember me
When you see me on your TV screen
It may be the first time
But it won't be the last time
