I was born in America but
I feel like I was raised on Mars
No matter how hard I try
I still feel like I'm an alien cause
I was taught at a private school
My parents were scared of what I'd do if I were bullied
Would I one day snap and bring drugs and guns to school?

If I told you once I told you too many times
I've got a real short temper and I'm out of my mind
Should've been medicated when I was young but
My mom chose to pray instead of whoring me out
I can't shake the feeling that I'm falling apart
I know I've been told I've got fire in my heart but
The world it brings me down
And I'm not sure how much more I can take

I see a light at the end of the tunnel
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
I see a light at the end of the tunnel
I see the light at the end of the tunnel

I was born in a hospital
And I'll die in a hospital bed
Alone and happy
Will my kids be there, will they be too busy?
You're as fickle as you've ever been
You'll be gone just as soon as the trend ends
And I'll be playing
In front of 10 drunk fans god willing

Social media you know you're breaking my heart
I got a hundred thousand people telling me all their thoughts and
It's not that I can't relate
I can't reply to each and every comment made
We're never good enough no matter how hard we try
There's always a better band, better song make up your mind
Do you love us for who we are?
Or our skinny jeans and tattooed arms?

I see a light at the end of the tunnel
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
I see a light at the end of the tunnel
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
I see a light at the end of the tunnel
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
I see a light at the end of the tunnel
I see the light at the end of the tunnel

I was born in America
I will die in a hospital
I see a light at the end of the tunnel (I was born in America)
I see the light at the end of the tunnel

I see a light at the end of the tunnel
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
I see a light at the end of the tunnel
