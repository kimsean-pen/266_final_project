I've got the understanding of a 4-year-old
I've got the peace of mind of a killer's soul
I've got the rationale of a New York cop
I've got the patience of a chopping block yeah

Trip like I do (oh my god this is the best)
Trip like I do (oh my god this is the best)

I've got the acumen of a seasoned pro
I've got the legacy of a billion souls
I've got the world on my back but I don't seem to care
I've got the comprehension of a world unaware yeah

Trip like I do (oh my god this is the best)
Trip like I do
Trip like I do (oh my god this is the best)
(mm... I want you to trip like I do)

Can't you, can't you trip like I do
Can't you, can't you trip like I do

Laid down on my back I can't sleep cause I'm falling
Eyes in my teeth I can't see cause I'm eating
Head full of noise I can't think cause it's crushing
Back on my feet like a freight train I'm coming

Can everybody feel like I do
Can everybody feel like I do (oh my god)

Can't you, can't you trip like I do
Can't you, can't you trip like I do (oh my god)

Can't you trip, can't you think, can't you feel like I do
Can't you walk, can't you breathe, can't you trip like I do...

Can't you trip, can't you think, can't you feel like I do
Can't you walk, can't you breathe, can't you trip like me...
