Acres
Acres
Steeples

I don't know what I'm doing here
I don't know why I'm standing here
I don't know who I'm working for
I don't know what I'm begging for

I'm living in a pastoral picture
In a pastoral picture
In a pastoral picture
In a pastoral picture
In a pastoral picture
In a pastoral picture
In a pastoral picture

I don't know
(in a pastoral picture)
(in a pastoral picture)
I don't know
(in a pastoral)
What I'm doing

Cattle
Cattle
Tearooms
And roadkill

I don't know what I'm doing here
I don't know why I'm standing here
I don't know what I'm waiting for
I don't know what I'm living for

In a pastoral picture
In a pastoral picture
In a pastoral picture
