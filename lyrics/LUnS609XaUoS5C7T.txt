Do you know
Where your heart's been placed
It seems to be runnin'
Runnin' runnin' runnin'
You seem so lost in your
White noise phase
Don't worry keep on gunnin' gunnin' gunnin'

Throw out the stress
And go hurry, keep up
This ain't a rat race
Your head high above
Earthquake's got you
Shaken up and out the door
But you need to find the cure

Go just go
Don't ever forget
Where you need to go
You'll find a place to belong
Don't ever forget
Where you need to go
No don't lose your way home

I'm telling you don't
Lose your way home
I'm telling you don't
Lose your way home
I'm telling you don't
Lose your way home
I'm telling you don't
Lose your way home
I'm telling you don't
Lose your way home (Oh)
I'm telling you don't
Lose your way home (Oh)
Lose your way home

Did you find where your
Heart was placed
I see you've been runnin'
Runnin' runnin' runnin'
You still seem lost
In the white noise phase
Don't worry keep on gunnin'
Gunnin' gunnin'

Breathe in breathe out
Debris there you keep inside
Get on get out
The air will guide you tonight
This ain't a war
No it's only a fight
Hurry now
And go find the cure oh

Go just go
Don't ever forget
Where you need to go
You'll find a place to belong
Don't ever forget
Where you need to go
No don't lose your way home

I'm telling you don't
Lose your way home
(I'm telling you don't
Lose your way home) (Oh)
I'm telling you don't
Lose your way home (Oh)
I'm telling you don't
Lose your way home (Oh)
I'm telling you don't
Lose your way home (Oh)

I know you're lost
In your white noise phase
Don't worry keep on runnin' runnin'
Till you find your way home
