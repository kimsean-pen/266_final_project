What if I was wrong, and jumped to conclusions
Cause the chance of losing you was all too dangerous
So I just assume that you're doing things before you get that chance
So I can leave and feel like I've got the upper hand
Guilty yeah, maybe I'm just scared to go all in
Never was much for the life of gambling
But you can't win if you don't play
If you don't play there's no shame in us
Let's call a spade a spade

Cause you left your tears on the runway

You think you're running away
And you're leaving all your troubles behind
But I'm not going with you this time

I don't wanna try and pretend I'm somebody else
Take me as I am or be left alone

Tears on the runway
You know that you love the chase

I said I wouldn't let you down
But it's like we both have changed somehow
You've made a disease of this town
But you act like you don't care
A wise woman said, I wish people weren't afraid of love
Then she packed her shit and ran
Like a coward when the thunder struck

Cause you left your tears on the runway

You think you're running away
You're leaving all your troubles behind
But I ain't going with you this time
I don't wanna try to pretend I'm somebody else
Take it or leave it

Tears on the runway

You know that you love the chase
Baby love
You know me too well
You know me too well
You know that I love the chase
