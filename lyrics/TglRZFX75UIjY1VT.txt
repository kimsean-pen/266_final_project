There was a single one
Then there were ten
When ten made a hundred
And a hundred million
You came and spoke to me
I saw your face
Your words were like raindrops from a storming ...
Each generation different
He was made to love her
She was made to love him
And their offspring loved them
And in the marriage of eagle and snake
The parents are huddle
But the offspring is brain
The final edges are all through the night
The flag is contagious
But the heat feels alright
Can't recognize a property
He was made to love her
She was made to love him
And their offspring loved them
There is a darkness I feel coming round
And shadows that lengthen from the sky to the ground
And a silence that can swallow a sound
He was made to love her
She was made to love him
And their offsá¹—ring loved them
He was made to love her
She was made to love him
And their offspring loved them
