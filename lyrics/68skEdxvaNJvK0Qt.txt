You and I were members of the same online community
I know that it sounds kinda lame when I say it out loud
But it's true we met there
It's where we spent most of our time
Talking to friends
Friends that we met online

And you were always there for me
When I was feeling kinda lonely
I think of things you said to me all the time

Yeah sure we met there
It's a really big part of our lives
Talking to friends
Friends that we met online

Some people go to work at night
And some people go to sleep
Some people live in big apartments
Still, they're giving you the creeps
I sit up in my bed
And I'm sick to my cyber soul
How you ever gonna teach me something
I don't even wanna know

How can we misremember such sad, horrible times
Talking to friends
Friends that we met online

Friends that we met online
Friends that we met online
Friends that we met online
