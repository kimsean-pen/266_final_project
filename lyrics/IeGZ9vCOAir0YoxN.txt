I was walkin' down the street
When this boy started following me
Though I ignored all the things he said
He moved me in every way

With his collar unbuttoned
On my side he was struttin'

He was really sayin' somethin'
Really sayin' somethin'
Bop bop soo be do wa
Bop bop soo be do wa

He flirted every step of the way
I could hear every word he'd say
My resistance was gettin' low
And my feelings started to show

My heart started pumpin'
Blood pressure jumpin'

He was really sayin' somethin'
Really sayin' somethin'
Bop bop soo be do wa
Bop bop soo be do wa

He walked me to my door
I agreed to see him once more
Late in night, it may not be yet
But he moved me tremendously

All though he was bold
My heart he stole

He was really sayin' somethin'
Really sayin' somethin'
Bop bop soo be do wa
Bop bop soo be do wa

Really sayin' somethin'
Really sayin' somethin'
Bop bop soo be do wa
Bop bop soo be do wa

Really sayin' somethin'
Really sayin' somethin'
Bop bop soo be do wa
Bop bop soo be do wa

Really sayin' somethin'
Really sayin' somethin'
Bop bop soo be do wa
Bop bop soo be do wa
