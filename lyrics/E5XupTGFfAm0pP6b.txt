Crooks lay in a weighted state waiting for the dead
assassin while the rust pure powder puffs, a shimmering opaque red.
Papers spread, no-one driving, we hurled direct ahead,
the windows dark-green tinted, the hearse a taxi instead.
Snow storms forecast imminently in areas
Dogger, Viking, Moray, Forth, and Orkney.
Keeping cover in denuded scrub,
the school destroyed raised the
club, panic spreading with threat of fire.
Crowding beneath a layer of foam, refugees intertwined, alone.
Within the institution walls, in pastel blue,
clinical white, slashed red lipsticked walls, mercy nurse tonight.
Seems like dark grey stockings in the raking
torchlight with 4 AM stubble, a midnight transvestite.
