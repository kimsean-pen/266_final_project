What fine judgement I see
in the eyes of our world leaders
Oh how beautiful life could be
if it hadn't been shot to pieces

Shot to pieces

What secret music do I hear
upon the drums of my ear

What great pleasure I feel
I come from nowhere and I shall return
Because of you people I will flee
I see my late identity burn
