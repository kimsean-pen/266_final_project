Sitting on a rainbow looking at the world
Standin' by the roadside waiting for my girl
Earning time and let it pay
When the sunshine's on its way
This ie what you'll hear my say
Riding on a jet plane
Higher than a bird
Looking out the window
Don't believe a word
Earning time, earning pay
When the sunshine's on its way
This is what you hear me say
