Woah, you takin' all I own
You're feeding something make me start to see in the night
(It's all I)
Wont you help me roll back home
The feat is stumbling, walk me down the street in the light

Walk on or die
I will never know

Lowered mind, won't take my, eyes to see the break in your way
Release your problems, release your problems, release your problems

Lowered mind, won't take my, eyes to see the break in your way
Release your problems, release your problems, release your problems

Feels downhill, worried by your ivory poison reachin' round the streets in open fire eyes
(Fight, you fight, fight)
Feel some light though, leave the light on, I could be the warmest soul if I like though

What I lie? What a night? What a night?
Don't lie to my face
