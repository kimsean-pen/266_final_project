I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain sometime

When you take you gotta give
So live and let live
Or let go oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden

I could promise you things
Like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover
So you better think it over

Well, if sweet-talkin' you
Could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter?

So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain sometime

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden

I could sing you a tune
And promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you
I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know

You better look before you leap
Still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talkin' about

So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain sometime
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
