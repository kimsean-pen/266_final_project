My DNA is running out
I am not the guy who makes you smile now
And when we talk it's not the same
But I already lost the gene for feeling pain

So I won't cry
No I will just pretend
I'm still the one
And that we are in love again

But when I call you are never home
I am down to six or seven chromosomes
But you don't care or understand
How it feels to be a single double strand

But I won't cry
No I will just pretend
I'm still the one
And that we are in love again

All these molecules don't make me who I am
You did
So I will just pretend
I'm still the one
And we are in love again

But I won't cry
No I will just pretend
That I'm still the one I was
And that we are in love again

Well I won't cry
Oh no I will just pretend
I'm still the one
And that we are in love again
