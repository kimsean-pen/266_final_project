Patience's only gets you so far
Blood will get you further
Pain will only make your heart hard, tossed in fury's weather
Innocence is beautiful to see
Won't you box it up for me?
For me

Oh, give me strength and give me peace
Does any body out there want to you hear me?

It's just another downpour, don't let it get the best of you
It's only up from the floor, light everything inside of you
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me

Sadness is my enemy
I fear time will age him gently
Walking by my side for all these years
Seems that we've grown friendly
Happiness is beautiful to see
Won't you box it up for me?
For me

Oh, give me strength and give me peace
Does any body out there want to you hear me?

It's just another downpour, don't let it get the best of you
It's only up from the floor, light everything inside of you
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me

It's just another downpour
It's just another downpour

Its just another downpour, don't let it get the best of you
It's only up from the floor, light everything inside of you
I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me
I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me
