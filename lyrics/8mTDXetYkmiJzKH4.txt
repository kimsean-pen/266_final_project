Hey kid at the show tonight.
The face beyond the barricade
How ya dance and ya sing to every single line
Like it was you up on that stage

I mean to know your secret
I'm asking you for help
How do I fall in love with anything
Like you seem to do so well?
I gotta get back to when it came out
The way it was supposed to sound
Before money was ever changing hands
And my feet were on the ground

When I could feel the wind's direction
When I knew what songs to sing

And he said, "Try not to get upset
Let it all go by
Because how can it be that bad
If we're all gonna die?"

So I started to think about
That girl that disappeared
And if really was the road that pulled me away
Or if I'm still a victim of my fears

As she showed me, the machine ran
That our words protect us from
How she could keep me in the moment
How that's all there ever was

As she called, I asked to see her
Even if it's just a couple days
I could meet her out in Georgia
She could fly out to LA

And if the plane goes down on her way to me
I think I know how she would react

She'd smile and close her eyes.
Think about her life.
While some voice screaming in the back
"We're all gonna die."

So try not to get upset
Everything is fine
Hey, it's not that big a deal
We're all gonna die
