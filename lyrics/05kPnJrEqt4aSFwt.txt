If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that have hurt you
And you'd stay

I don't know why I did the things I did
I don't know why I said the things I said
Pride's like a knife, it can cut deep inside
Words are like weapons, they wound sometimes

I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't wanna see you go
I know I made you cry, but baby

If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that have hurt you
And you'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me
Like you used to do
(If I could turn back time)

My world was shattered, I was torn apart
Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart
When you walked out that door
I swore that I didn't care
But I lost every thing, darlin', then and there

Too strong to tell you I was sorry
Too proud to tell you I was wrong
I know that I was blind, and darlin'

If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that have hurt you
And you'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me
Like you used to do, ohh

If I could turn back time
(If I could turn back time)
If I could turn back time
(If I could turn back time)
If I could turn back time, ohh baby

I didnt really mean to hurt you
I didn't wanna see you go
I know I made you cry
But ohh

If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that have hurt you
If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd love me, love me
Like you used to do

If I could turn back time
(Turn back time)
If I could find a way (Find a way)
Then maybe, maybe, maybe you'd stay
(Reach the stars)
