Eyes
Boring a way into me
Eyes
Destroying so sweetly
Now
There is a fire on me
A fire that burns

This fire is out of control
We're going to burn this city
Burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're going to burn this city
Burn this city
This fire is out of control
This fire is out of control
This fire is out of control, oh how I burn
Eyes
Boring a way into me

Paralyse
Controlling completely
Now
There is a fire in me
A fire that burns

This fire is out of control

We're going to burn this city
Burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're going to burn this city
Burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're going to burn this city
Burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're going to burn it, I'll burn it, I'll, I'll, I'll burn it

Eyes
Burning a way through me
Overwhelm
Destroying so sweetly
Now
There is a fire in me
A fire that burns

This fire is out of control
We're going to burn this city
Burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're going to burn this city
Burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're going to burn this city
Burn this city
This fire is out of control
And I'm, I'm out of control and I burn
Oh how I burn for you
Burn
Oh how I burn for you
Burn
How I burn
How I burn
Oh how I

This fire is out of control
We're going to burn this city
Burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're going to burn this city
Burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're going to burn this city
Burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're going to burn it, I'll burn it, I'll, I'll, I'll burn it
