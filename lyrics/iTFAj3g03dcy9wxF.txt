As the dust settles, see our dreams,
all coming true
it depends on you,
If our times, they are troubled times,
show us the way,
tell us what to do

As our faith, maybe aimless blind,
hope our ideals and
our thoughts are yours
And believing the promises,
please make your claims
really so sincere

Be our guide, our light and our way of life
and let the world see the way we lead our way
Hopes, dreams, hopes dreaming that all our
sorrows gone

In your hands, holding everyone's
future and fate
It is all in you,
Make us strong build our unity,
all men as one
it is all in you

Be our guide, our light and our way of life
and let the world see the way we lead our way
Hopes, dreams, dreaming that all our sorrows
gone forever
