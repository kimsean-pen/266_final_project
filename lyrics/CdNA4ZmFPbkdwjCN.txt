now you know how i feel
a latent calm that's half confused
sometimes i'm strong i feel
that i don't care that i've done wrong
finding out what is real for you
kinda drawn and half amused
feelings change and sometimes i can't deal
with all these things
equivocation
i'm messed
unreasonable tongue is soporific
thinking softer softer still
i really ought to know
you should
now you know how i feel
kinda drawn but half uncertain
thinking what if maybe
there is something greater still
