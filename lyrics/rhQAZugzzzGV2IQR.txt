So afraid of rejection
Hide inside ourselves
Acting like strangers to avoid the pain

We collect our phobias
Our sicknesses
Feel so good only when we can complain

In your arms
Feels like a better us
In your arms

Dancing around the fire
Getting drunk with the night
Nobody is ever who they seem to be

Hypnos give us your hand
We so tire of this life
Need to rest and finally disappear

In your arms
Feels like a better us
In your arms
