Blud when you hear them sirens coming
I can hear them sirens coming
Better run when you hear the sirens coming
I can hear them sirens coming1 to the 2 to the 3 to the 4
Limehouse police knocking at my door
12 black boots on my bedroom floor
What they want with Rascal I'm not
sureTook me to the station eight-thirty
For a fright night I had recently
Say they got me on CCTV
And them pussyole boys told on meCan't
understand why these boys keep snitchin'
Can't understand why these boys keep bitchin'
Now I'm hot tempered feel like switchin'
Can't stand still trigger finger
itchin'Gotta stay calm, gotta keep my cool
If I go jail, I'll be a damn fool
Gotta rise up, gotta stand up tall
Can't let them see the end of Dizzee

To that old school storytelling shit,
get me1 day I was with my bredren Aido roaming the street
On the main road hungry, looking for somethin' to eat
Not no burger or no chips, shit, that's easily digested
It's the shit that if you're caught,
you'll be easily arrestedWe was on the
robbing street, I forgot to mention Clayton
Was dis bredder rollin' wit us, he was scared and it was blatant
He was panned back to the storyAido
spotted a man straight ahead of us in the distance
With his wifey holdin' hands, so we followed 'em
Into this little alleyway into the
flatsAnd when we thought the time was perfect
We crept up and we attacked, I took the first swing
Unexpected causin' panic, we was ruthless
Causin' agony it was public it was tragicMe and
Aido lost the plot, acting like we were from hell
Put his bredder to the floor, moved his wifey up as well
Clayton stood back shakin' wishing that he never came
Then from outta nowhere was Alisha screaming
out my nameShe's went my school, she saw it all
And by this time she's crying
And to make it worse I'm hearing sirens
I ain't even tryin' to hang
aroundBlud when you hear them sirens coming

Better run when you hear the sirens coming

I can hear them sirens coming
I break the law I will never change
I break the law I will never change
I break the law I will never changeStep
into my zone, get your whole face rearranged
See me on the telly but I ain't no actor
Running through the street brave face
It's a jack warBroad daylight no shame like a lunatic
Rain, hail, sleet or snow, I ain't new to it
Show me what you got, better give it up quickly
Lay them on their back if they chat back
swiftlyBetter mind out when they come through the manor man
Keep them on their toes like hammer, man
It's no joke man, woman and child I'm seeking
See no sex, no age,
I'm creepingAnything for the dough, cold and the wheelers
Duck for the feds and I roll with the dealers
Roll with the hard heads signed young offenders
No my life ain't nothing like
eastendersStep into my zone get your whole face rearranged
I break the law I will never change
