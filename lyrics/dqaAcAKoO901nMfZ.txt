Press play
Fast forward
Nonstop, we have a beaten path before us
It was all there
In plain sight
Come on, people
We have all seen the signs

So we will never
Get back to
To the old school
To the old grounds
It's all about the newfound
We are the newborn
The world knew all about us.

(We are the future and we're here to stay)

We've come a long way
Since that day
And we will never look back
At the faded silhouette
We've come a long way
Since that day
And we will never look back
Look back
At the faded silhouette

Straight ahead
On the path
We have before us
Day by day, soon
The change will come
Don't you know
We took a big step forward
Just lead the way
And we pull the trigger

And we will never
Get back to
To the old school
To the old grounds
It's all about the newfound
We are the newborn
The world knew all about us.

(We are the future and we're here to stay)

We've come a long way
Since that day
And we will never look back
At the faded silhouette
We've come a long way
Since that day (that day)
We've come a long way
Since that day
And we will never look back
At the faded silhouette
We've come a long way
Since that day
And we will never look back
Look back
At the faded silhouette
