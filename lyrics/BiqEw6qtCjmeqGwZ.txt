What if how I felt was wrong
What if what we had was strong
Strong enough to give us everything we hoped and dreamed
It didn't make it easier
I guess I have a lot to learn
Am I a criminal?
Am I a thief?
Have I just broken something that I really need?.
Would you stay with me, come back home to me
Would we get it all back
Am I a criminal? Am I a thief?.
I have nothing left to say
Time is pulling you away
Distance getting bigger,
Now everything just starts to fade
It didn't make it easier
Still waiting for a miracle
Am I a criminal?
Am I a thief?
Have I just broken something that I really need?.
Would you stay with me, come back home to me
Would we get it all back
Am I a criminal? Am I a thief?.
I'm out of alibis
I finally realise
It could be easier
But it's never easier...
