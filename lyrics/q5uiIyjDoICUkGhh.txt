Come under with me
Through young girls' dreams
Don't wake me up too soon
There's a halo on the moon
You hunger, I'll thirst
Pink stars do burst
God of lightning, goddess of fern
A map to memorize, a lullaby to learn
Come on darling, take me there
Where red clouds blew and fill the air
Where my purple heart beats to your jet black snout
Up on piney point if you dare

You're my blood, you're my wine
You're my mountain to climb
Say you're mine
You're mine
You're mine
Bride in the fog
And no way out
Can't see my own hands
Can't hear a sound
Where angels conspire and heroes do drown
I am lost in the mire, upside down
Is that my soul on fire whirling by?
Take a walk, man of god
I just want to die
I tell you my friend
The widow is on my trail

(Shhh)

You'll hear her
You will know her

The chill on the skin
The song on the wind

To wonder, to roam
To never know home
To lie under a sky of blood reds and pale blues
To trail ten thousand miles in a dead man's shoes
There's a demon loose, a demon loose
I can't get home
I can't get home
For the road is a snake of mist
In the shadow of a rebel's fist
His jacket on my back
His bones on the shore
But the secret to dreams is to dream up a door

A portrait of him
A picture of her
A keyhole in a Douglas fir

Now
Now
Ah
