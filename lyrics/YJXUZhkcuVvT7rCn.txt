i've been letting out mistakes
for all of you to hate
when 'm not okay
will all of you still be around?

when I'm lost
the white and brown i bought
when my medicine arrives
i feel very alive inside

its not okay
to always be in pain
when you're OD'ing who's gna be buy your side?
it's all you buy
and we're shooting all the time
and your friends will start to change
and your not really the same
