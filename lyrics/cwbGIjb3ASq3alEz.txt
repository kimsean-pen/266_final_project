Went home in the best of ways
Still smiling on the best of days
Rain falling 'til there's clear skies
Not looking for a reason why

Stay holy 'til you make it whole
Fast diamonds aren't the way to go
When they sell you on the good life
They're eating from the withered vine

Tell me
Where'd you go
Won't you let me
Take control
I'm about to flip it up and tell you why

Do you wanna know my name
Do you wanna know my number
All we gonna light the flame
Or just feed into the hunger?

Do you wanna know my name
Do you wanna know my number
Are we gonna light the flame
Or just feed into the hunger?
Do you wanna know my name

All it takes is a little time
Sweet cherries and roses from the grape vine
Then you'll know you've got a good girl
Who'll love you when you're hatin' on the real world

Tell me
Where'd you go
Won't you let me
Take control
I'm about to flip it up and tell you why

Do you wanna know my name
Do you wanna know my number
All we gonna light the flame
Or just feed into the hunger?

Do you wanna know my name
Do you wanna know my number
Are we gonna light the flame
Or just feed into the hunger?
Do you wanna know my name
