All on you

She'd hang on every word
If you'd list them all for her

On everything you say
She'd keep them all inside
But the vow she never heard

That day never came
But she wants you all the same
But she never heard you say
"I am here to stay-ay-ay-ay"

Just a little love
It goes a long, long way

So why not start today?

It's all on you
I'm not gonna back
I'm not gonna move
Nothing I will say or do, (it's)
All on you
So tell me what you want
You need to find the words baby
Before the night's over

If the sun is almost up
Why are stars still in my eyes?
(Still in my eyes)
They never go away
And I'm wishing you could find
A place in the night sky

That day never came
But I want you all the same
Though I never heard you say
"I am here to stay-ay-ay-ay"

Just a little love
It goes a long, long way

So why not start today?

It's all on you
I'm not gonna back
I'm not gonna move
Nothing I will say or do, (it's)
All on you
So tell me what you want
You need to find the words baby
Before the night's over

Won't you tell me?
Won't you tell me, baby?
Won't you tell me?
Before the night's over
Won't you tell me? (It's all)
Won't you say it, baby? (On you)
Won't you tell me?
Before the night's over

Before the night's over

Am I wasting my time here?
Waiting for you?
It's almost daylight
Don't know what to do
I see in your eyes
But I still need more proof
It won't come from my mouth
Now it's all on (you)

All on you
I'm not gonna back
I'm not gonna move
Nothing I will say or do, (it's)
All on you
So tell me what you want
You need to find the words baby
Before the night's over

Won't you tell me?
Won't you tell me, baby?
Won't you tell me?
Before the night's over
Won't you tell me?
Won't you say it, baby?
Won't you tell me?
Before the night's over

Won't you tell me?
Won't you tell me, baby?
Won't you tell me?
Before the night's over
Won't you tell me?
Won't you say it, baby?
Won't you tell me?
Before the night's over

Won't you tell me?
Won't you tell me, baby?
Won't you tell me?
Before the night's over
Won't you tell me?
Won't you say it, baby?
Won't you tell me?
Before the night's over
