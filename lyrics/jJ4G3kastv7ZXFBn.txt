Another evening spent
In the corners of my brain
Where I wander off into the dark
And I close my eyes and hope
The wolves won't follow me
But hope's hard of hearing
So I'm waiting for the teeth

I had to learn that the helping hand
Can be the same that holds the knife
I know I'm not well but I'm alright
You gotta learn how to take your hits
When your hands are always tied
I know I'm not well but I'm alright

I memorize the ceiling
With a fire at my feet
While I give myself
Advice that I can't keep
I no longer ask myself
What any of this means
I just want my mind to quit
So I can finally fall asleep
Yeah I'm just waiting
For my mind to quit
So I can finally fall asleep

I kept falling for the broken wing
Because I couldn't pick the fight
But don't believe 'em when they
Tell ya that the bird won't bite
I can't tell you if it got this way
Or if it started as a lie
I know I'm not well but I'm alright

I kept falling for the broken wing
Because I couldn't pick the fight
But don't believe 'em when they
Tell ya that the bird won't bite

I had to learn that the helping hand
Can be the same that holds the knife
I know I'm not well but I'm alright

(I know I'm not well but I'm alright)
