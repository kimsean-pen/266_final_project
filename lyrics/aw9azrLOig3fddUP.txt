Ohio small road
Color lights in the nights
Find some hand to hold
Let the car coast with no lights
Ohweeohweeoh kids move so slow
Moon in the window and girls on the floor
Ohweeohweeoh kids movie so slow
Duds wrapped around each other drinking up the sweet and water
Ohweeohweeoh kids movie so slow
Jump a cross a river got a long way to go
Ohweeohweeoh kids move so slow
It's the smallest water pile dreamy bruises sweet lovers
And they say I want you(you)
To see all the ways I can move
To see how a skin so smooth
See how my blood runs blue
Pull out the hand that moves you
It's the heart beat don't fight
Let your limbs flare in the mood
Like your a wild thing doing right
How can we question
What we knows feels right
Black eyes turn to marigolds
In the morning light
Ohweeohweeoh kids move so slow
Shaken all over like some dogs at the pool
Ohweeohweeoh kids move so slow
There kicken all the records over acting like they hanging water
Ohweeohweeoh kids move so slow
Down in the basement where the sun don't show
Ohweeohweeoh kids movie so slow
Naked dollars wonder piles dreamy bruises rotten lovers
And they say I want you(you)
To bend me back in two
To make me sing your tune
To make those words so smooth
Fill me like a song do, fill me like a song do,
Fill me like a song do, fill me like a song do,
Fill me like a song do, fill me like a song do,
Fill me like a song do, fill me like a song do,
Fill me like a song do,
(Ohweeohweeoh)
Fill me like a song do,
(Ohweeohweeoh)
Fill me like a song do,
(Ohweeohweeoh)
Fill me like a song do,
(Ohweeohweeoh)
Fill me like a song do,
(Ohweeohweeoh)
Fill me like a song do,
(Ohweeohweeoh)
Fill me like a song do,
(Ohweeohweeoh)
Fill me like a song do,
(Ohweeohweeoh)
