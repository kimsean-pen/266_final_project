Meet director of silence,
Would I lie?
Twisting the bed into worn grain.
Even if cut from the dialog,
I had to show you all how I felt about this scene.
Didn't want this but this is what you get.
Your never ready when it comes.
Yeah, you should really take this one in.

It needed to be real for sure
We need it to feel for this silent perfection
Standing above her body was surreal.
And I would show you what I've done, but it's concealed.
I've cut down a man who never knew my sick, sick plan.
I've cut down a man who never knew my sick, sick plan.

You all make us fail!

Burn the real and our everything.
They could never learn to deal with this.
Would I lie?
I take your heart for the sake of my art,
I'll burn the real.
They could never learn to deal.
They're not ready to feel

What my dying arms will let go.

I must be sick, look at what I did...
I must be sick, look at what I did to your heart.
I must be sick, look at what I did to your heart.
I must be sick.
I must be sick.
Look at what I did to your heart.

It needed to be real for sure.
We needed to feel for the sake of the kingdom.
For the silent perfection!
We needed to feel for the sake of the kingdom.
