Go run forth and tell the world
With your blank pages
And your microphones
Go remember their faces
And press record
To break the heart

Let's make this last forever
Oh forever
Let's make this last forever
Oh oh

Nowhere man
Give me your hand
Let me save you
Let me save you

Faithless-man
Give me your hand
Let me save you
Let me save you

Oh oh
Run, run just as fast as you can
Can you see the light
So bright
Surrounds you

Fade we begin to fade
Then we reach out
To grab the hand of fate

Let's make this last forever
Oh forever
Let's make this last forever
Oh oh

Nowhere man
Give me your hand
Let me save you
Let me save you

Faithless-man
Give me your hand
Let me save you
Let me save you

Nowhere man
Give me your hand
Let me save you
Let me save you

Faithless-man
Give me your hand
Let me save you
Let me save you

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide tonight
We'll take them over
The darker the night
The stronger the light is

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide tonight
We're chasing sun down
The darker the night
The stronger the light is
