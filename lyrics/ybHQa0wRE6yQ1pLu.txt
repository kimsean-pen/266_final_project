(M. Cooper, B. Higgins, Girls Aloud)

The people in my bed
Are making me brain dead
And nothing that I can say
Could get them to go
The stories you told me
Are leaving me lonely
But daddy you sold me
And I didn't know

If you wanna rock
Heads will roll
If you wanna stop
Let me go
If you wanna rock
Get it on
If you wanna stop
Turn and I'll be gone

Thank me daddy
For the things that you'll never know
And listen to the noise that I'm making
Not the boys on my answer phone
Oh please
Thank me daddy
For the things that you never knew
I'm sorry but it's rough in the city
And there's just nothing you can do

The rules that I'm breaking
And beds that I'm shaking
Were there for the taking
How could I say no?
So daddy remember
I live for the pleasure
I love you whatever
So just let me go

If you wanna rock
Heads will roll
If you wanna stop
Let me go
If you wanna rock
Get it on
If you wanna stop
Turn and I'll be gone

Thank me daddy
For the things that you'll never know
And listen to the noise that I'm making
Not the boys on my answerphone
Oh please
Thank me daddy
For the things that you never knew
I'm sorry but it's rough in the city
And there's just nothing you can do

We don't talk anymore
We don't know what love is for
So long as we keep the score
We're trying cos
We don't care anyway
There's only so much to say
Because those little lies are satisfying

Thank me daddy
For the things that you'll never know
And listen to the noise that I'm making
Not the boys on my answerphone
Oh please
Thank me daddy
For the things that you never knew
I'm sorry but it's rough in the city
And there's just nothing you can do
