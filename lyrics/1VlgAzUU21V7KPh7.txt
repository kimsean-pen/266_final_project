Hush now
you're standing on a land mine
tread lightly, get ready to explode

Hush now
those eyes can not harm
keep your wits about
don't let it bring you down

Don't let it bring you down
don't let it bring you down
let it bring you down
don't let it bring you down
don't let it bring you down
don't let it bring you down

How can we disguise it's all for you
I've seen it all before
your eyes swollen
head is on a ...
and it's only a matter of time
before we hit the ground running
running running
running running

Don't let it bring you down
don't let it bring you down
let it bring you down
don't let it bring you down
don't let it bring you down
don't let it bring you down

How can we disguise it's all for you

Hush now
you're standing on a land mine
tread lightly
get ready to explode

Hush now
your eyes can not harm you
keep your wits about
don't let it bring you down

And never let go ooo
it will never be too much
and I'm afraid of being too much

Don't let it bring you down
don't let it bring you down
let it bring you down
don't let it bring you down
don't let it bring you down
don't let it bring you down

How can we disguise it's all for you
