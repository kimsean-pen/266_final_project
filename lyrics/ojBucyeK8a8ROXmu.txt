Like our lives depend on it
How we did get to lyin', cryin', always fightin'
Like our lives depend on it

Like our lives depend on it
Why you lookin' at me with angry eyes
How we ever gon' make it out alive
If we don't get back to lovin', touchin', kissin', f-
Like our lives depend on it

Why you lookin' at me with angry eyes
How we ever gon' make it out alive
If we don't get back to lovin', touchin', squeezin' and f-
Like our lives depend on it
