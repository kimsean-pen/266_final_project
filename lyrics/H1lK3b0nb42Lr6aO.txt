Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, ro-hey!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, ro-hey!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, ro-hey!

Violence is an energy against the enemy
Well, violence is an energy, ro-hey!
Bringing on the fury, acquire infantry
Revolt against the honor to obey

Overthrow the effigy, the vast majority
Well, burning down the foreman of control
Silence is the enemy against your urgency
So rally up the demons of your soul

Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, ro-hey!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, ro-hey!

The insurgency will rise
When the blood's been sacrificed
Don't be blinded by the lies in your eyes

Sing!

Well, violence is an energy, oh-ay, oh-ay
Well, from here to eternity, oh-ay, oh-ay
Well, violence is an energy, oh-ay, oh-ay
Well, silence is the enemy so gimme, gimme revolution!

Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, ro-hey!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, ro-hey!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, ro-hey!

Overthrow the effigy, the vast majority
Burning down the foreman of control
Silence is the enemy against your urgency
So rally up the demons of your soul
