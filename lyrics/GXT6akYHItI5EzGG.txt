If only you could know
Silhouettes on your shadows
Will it all be the same?
I go back where we started
Where we gave it all too soon
But you know it comes back to you

So take me down
'Cause I see you when I close my eyes
Turn a corner, take me by surprise
And what doesn't work on this first try
Maybe better in the next life
And we'll laugh until the sun will rise
Try to talk but only get tongue-tied
So I live until the living's done
Got a feeling there's another one

If all I ever do
Is covered this world for you
And if all I've ever done
Hang on for the long run
And all you'll never see
Everyone breaking

So take me down
'Cause I see you when I close my eyes
Turn a corner, take me by surprise
And what doesn't work on this first try
Maybe better in the next life
And we'll laugh until the sun will rise
Try to talk but only get tongue-tied
So I live until the living's done
Got a feeling there's another one

And if only you could know
Silhouettes on your shadows

So take me down
'Cause I see you when I close my eyes
Turn a corner, take me by surprise
And what doesn't work on this first try
Maybe better in the next life
And we'll laugh until the sun will rise
Try to talk but only get tongue-tied
So I live until the living's done
Got a feeling there's another one
