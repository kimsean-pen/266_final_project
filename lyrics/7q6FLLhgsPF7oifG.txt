Show me your scars
I'll show you mine
My heart's a mess
That you unwind

So let's dive in
I don't need air
Yes I can breathe
Just 'cos you're there

And now my heartbeat sounds like thunder
Baby take my hand and pull me under

And I wanna dive through the river
I wanna see behind the mirror
Out of the dark and into the light
Will you be there when I'm coming up for air?

So let's get lost
Like it's a dream in technicolor, ultramarine
Too hot to burn, too high to fall
I'm in too deep but it don't matter at all

And now my heartbeat sounds like thunder
Baby take my hand and pull me under

And I wanna dive through the river
I wanna see behind the mirror
Out of the dark and into the light
Will you be there when I'm coming up for air?

Cos I'm coming up for air!
