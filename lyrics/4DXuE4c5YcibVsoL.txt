I won't ask for a second
I won't ask for a chance
I won't look to the Heavens
I found Hell where I stand

And I feel like I am fighting a lost cause
Just to be heard
I can't hear from the howling

Drowning every single word
Let me count the ways you kill me
You kill me

Let me count the ways you...
Drag me down with every word
Out of your mouth, the things we sing out loud
(When no one's listening!)
Drag me down with every word
Out of your mouth, the things we sing out loud
Let me count the ways you kill me

You kill me
And I feel like I'm floating
Faced down in a crowd
Caught up in the current
In an ocean of sounds
How did this room become so crowded
With no walls to keep us in?
How did we end up here
Surrounded on all sides

Yet so alone?
Let me count the ways you kill me
You kill me

Let me count the ways you...
Drag me down with every word
Out of your mouth, the things we sing out loud
(When no one's listening!)
Drag me down with every word
Out of your mouth, the things we sing out loud
Let me count the ways you kill me

You kill me
Alone in this house
We're all broken and hopeless
Again and again and again!
We fight 'til it's over
It's over, it's over

It's over again!
I won't look to the Heavens
I found Hell where I stand
Let me count the ways you...
Drag me down with every word
Out of your mouth, the things we sing out loud
(When no one's listening!)
Drag me down with every word
Out of your mouth, the things we sing out loud
Let me count the ways you kill me
You kill me
