Aw baby, switched at birth
The money ring around
So let's run away
Never to be found

A couple overdosing
A case of rolling rock
Just got personal
Don't call the cops

Spirit guide
Back seat driver
Colliding collapse the crash kills

Spirit guide
Back seat driver
'bout time that you took the wheel

Back seat driver
'bout time that you took the wheel

I want a fast trip
Into your blindspot
No more time to waste
It's getting too harsh

Spirit guide
Back seat driver
Colliding collapse the crash kills

Spirit guide
Back seat driver
'bout time that you took the wheel

Spirit guide
Back seat driver

Spirit guide
Back seat driver

Back again

Spirit guide
Back seat driver
'bout time that you took the wheel

Spirit guide
Back seat driver

Don't cry 'bout what you cannot change
Don't worry baby, I'll keep you safe
Don't cry 'bout what you cannot change
Don't worry baby, I'll keep you safe
