Your comin' home
There's blood on the walls
And Charlie and the family made house calls
If you're alone
Then watch what you do
'Cos Charlie and the family might get you

Can you hear them
In the darkness,
Helter Skelter
Spiral madness,
Yeah,
Bloodbath in paradise,
But there's no where you can run to baby,
Bloodbath in paradise
Forever sleep
In paradise

California sun
But you're still in bed
And the California rain is turning red
No sign of life
Or the keepers of doom
In Charlie and the keeper's scarlet room

Can you hear them
In the darkness,
Helter Skelter
Spiral madness,
Yeah,
Bloodbath in paradise,
But there's no where you can run to baby,
Bloodbath in paradise
Forever sleep
In paradise

They'll summon you,
To wake from the dead
As you lie bleeding,
Murdered in your bed
The sweetest dreams
Are all in your mind
But no-one wakes when Charlie creeps behind,
Yeah

Execution halts your breath,
Helter Skelter
Spiral death,
Bloodbath in paradise,
But there's no where you can break out baby
Bloodbath in paradise
Forever sleep
In paradise
