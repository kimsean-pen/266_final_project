Doctor, doctor, please
Oh, the mess I'm in
Doctor, doctor, please
Oh, the mess I'm in

She walked up to me
And really stole my heart
And then she started
To take my body apart

Living, loving, I'm on the run
Far away from you
Living, loving, I'm on the run
So far away from you

Doctor, doctor, please
Oh, I'm going fast
Doctor, doctor, please
Oh, I'm going fast

It's only just a moment
She's turning paranoid
That's not a situation
For a n-nervous boy

Living, loving, I'm on the run
So far away from you
Living, loving, I'm on the run
So far away from you

Doctor, doctor, please
Oh, the mess I'm in
Doctor, doctor, please
Oh, I'm going fast
Doctor, doctor, please
Oh, the mess I'm in
Doctor, doctor, please...
