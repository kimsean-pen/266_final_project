I see distance in your eyes
Bury me
To sleep tonight
Your touch divine
I saw distance in your eyes

He came to claim
What was his
And for years you lived
A solitary reign

I retraced
My steps to your embrace
I wanted you to stay
Yet you died away

Your touch divides
I see distance in
In your eyes
Please sing me to sleep tonight

And for years you lived
A solitary reign

Your touch divine
The distance in your eyes

You reside in me
The sacrifice

Like blood seeping through
Your old wounds
I am your old wound
You took your leave
A new life to lead
Torn from you
Inside of you
Mother mine

The most beautiful eyes I could look into
I now see distance in your eyes
You lived a solitary reign

And to all that ever mattered
To all I ever loved
A solitary reign
