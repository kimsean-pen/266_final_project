I finally asked you to dance
On the last slow song
Beneath that moon that was really a disco ball
I can still feel my head on your shoulder
And hoping that song would never be over

I haven't seen you in ages
Sometimes I find myself
wondering where you are
for me you'll always be 18
and beautiful and dancing away with my heart

I brushed your curls back so I could see your eyes
And the way you moved me was like you were reading my mind
I can still feel you leaning to kiss me
I can't help but wonder if you ever miss me

I haven't seen you in ages
Sometimes I find myself
wondering where you are
for me you'll always be 18
and beautiful and dancing away with my heart

You headed off to college
At the end of that summer when we lost touch
I guess I didn't realize even at that moment I lost so much

I haven't seen you in ages
Sometimes I find myself
wondering where you are
for me you'll always be 18
and beautiful and dancing away with my heart

Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Away with My Heart
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
