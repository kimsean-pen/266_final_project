Been a while since I felt this way about someone
I'd really really like to know you, more
Oh, know you, more

Oh, your eyes, they sing a song to me
And I, I'd really really like to move to it, oh, oh go, oh

And I will, oh, open my heart
And I will, oh, only for you

All your lies are spinning round my head
And all, all this line of song, ooh, yeah ooh, yeah
All your eyes are spinning round my head
And all, all this line of song, ooh, yeah ooh

and I will, oh, I, I, I, ohh, ohh
and I will, oh, only for you

And I just don't know what to do, my head has such a cloudy view
I'm so tired, of trying, ooh ooh ooh
And I just don't know what to do, my head has such a cloudy view
I'm so tired of trying, ooh ooh ooh

All your eyes are spinning round my head
And all, all this line of song, ooh, yeah oh on ooh, yeah
All your eyesare spinning round my head
And all, all this line of song, ooh, yeah on, ooh
And I will open my heart
And I will oh, only for you
