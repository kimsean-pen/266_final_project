I bet this road will take me out of here
Take me far away from Amarillo
I bet this car will go real fast
The wheels might even drive me past
The places that you said I'd never go, oh

Texas sky is the biggest one I've seen
But it still ain't big enough for you and me
All the things that make you mad
And all the baggage in your past
Don't leave much room for a girl like me to be
So I'll fill her up with hope and worn out dreams

And I'll grab the wheel and I'll point it west
Pack the good and leave the rest
I'll drive until I find the missing piece
You said, "I wouldn't get too far
On a tank of gas and an empty heart"
But I got everything I'll ever need
I got this old guitar and a brand new set of strings

Mama said, "I never should have done it"
Should have ended as before we ever started
Daddy knew about my pride
So he stood there and he smiled inside
I pretended that I didn't notice
A little tear that fell when I said, "I was going"

And I'll grab the wheel and I'll point it west
Pack the good and leave the rest
And drive until I find the missing piece
You said, "I wouldn't get too far
On a tank of gas and an empty heart"
And I got everything I'll ever need
I got this old guitar and a brand new set of strings

And I'm worried about life
And if it's right and right on time
I guess if you don't jump
You'll never know if you can fly

You said, "I wouldn't get too far
On a tank of gas and an empty heart"
But I got everything I'll ever need
I got this old guitar and a brand new set of strings
