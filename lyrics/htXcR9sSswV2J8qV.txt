When I open my eyes, what do I see
Falling from the skies in front of me
Not quite the... as though I've seen a ghost!
Is it too much to feel the touch
Of someone that you couldn't love
For someone that comes and goes, oh,

So how are you?
I'm doing well
I'm fighting tears, you couldn't tell
I'm not as strong as you thought I was.
When you fall down to your heels

You might have won the battle, but not the war
What goes around, comes around...

I'm doing well
I'm fighting tears, you couldn't tell
I'm not as strong as you thought I was.
When you fall down to your heels
I'm a broken, it ain't the ...
Baby, please, we're casualties of war!

I was caught right in the...
