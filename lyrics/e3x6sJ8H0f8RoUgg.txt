I'm standing, observing, cruising,
Star-bright crystals are forming
We both know what we've got to do
Head back to where the magic grew
Come on, let's go
Back to Moscow
Irresolution doesn't suit you
It's not hard; with you I have an alibi
You don't care the reason why I misapply
All I need's a fraction of your happy heart
All I need is you
And beauty's in the eye of the beholder
You have lips that permanently smoulder
When in Moscow I just want to fold you up
And keep you warm
keep you warm
Snowflakes
are gently
falling
Each one
on a
journey
We both know what we've got to do
Head back to where the magic grew
Come on, let's go
Back to Moscow
Irresolution doesn't suit you or me or anybody
It's not hard; with you I have an alibi
You don't care the reason why I misapply
All I need's a fraction of your happy heart
All I need is you
And beauty's in the eye of the beholder
You have lips that permanently smoulder
When in Moscow I just want to fold you up
And keep you warm
I said come here baby, come a little closer
You'll write words and I can be composer
Let's get a dog, an Irish red setter
It's all we need to get better
It feels good to not be with a wannabe
I am free whenever you're in front of me
All I need's a fraction of your happy heart
All I need is you
We both know what we've got to do
Head back to where the magic grew
M-O-S-C-O-W
You've got my heart, I've got your hand
So we are safe and sorted
It's not hard; with you I have an alibi
You don't care the reason why I misapply
All I need's a fraction of your happy heart.
All I need is you.
And beauty's in the eye of the beholder
You have lips that permanently smoulder
When in Moscow I just want to fold you up
And keep you warm
I said come here baby, come a little closer
You'll write words and I can be composer
Let's get a dog, an Irish red setter
It's all we need to get better
It feels good to not be with a wannabe
I am free whenever you're in front of me
All I need's a fraction of your happy heart
All I need is you
