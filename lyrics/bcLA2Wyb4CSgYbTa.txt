I went out looking for the answers
And never left my town
I'm no good at understanding
But I'm good at standing ground

And when I asked a corner preacher
I couldn't hear him for my youth
Some people get religion
Some people get the truth

I never get the truth
I never get the truth

I know the darkness pulls on you
But it's just a point of view
When you're outside looking in
You belong to someone

And when you feel like giving in
Or the coming of the end
Like your heart could break in two
Someone loves you

I laid this suitcase on my chest
So I could feel somebody's weight
And I laid you to rest
Just to feel the give and take

I got a new interpretation
And it's a better point of view
While you were looking for a landslide
I was looking out for you

I was looking out for you
Someone's looking out for you

I know the darkness pulls on you
But it's just a point of view
When you're outside looking in
You belong to someone

And when you feel like giving in
Or the coming of the end
Like your heart could break in two
Someone loves you

I am afraid of crossing lines
I am afraid of flying blind
Afraid of inquiring minds
Afraid of being left behind

I close my eyes, I think of you
I take a step, I think of you
I catch my breath, I think of you
I cannot rest, I think of you

My one and only wrecking ball
And you're crashing through my walls
When you're outside looking in
You belong to someone

And when you feel like giving in
Or the coming of the end
Like your heart could break in two
Someone loves you, yeah
