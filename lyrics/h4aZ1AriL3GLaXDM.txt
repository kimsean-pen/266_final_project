She was 5'10"
Looking real good in her skin
I think her shirt said Zepplin
Boots up to her ass man
She was elevated
She was a fan of the niggas that kept her motivated
She said she fucking with drake
I said king Kendrick
I guess we're kindred spirits

And I won't ever ever lie to you
I think you are the truth
I think I'd like to do some things to you
Our love is cool
Its cool

Under
It's love under the lights
Make love on the dance floor baby
Love under the lights, the lights, the lights tonight
Under, under, under, under...

He was six something
I think he told me he was on something
I took my papers and I rolled something
We're looking for some temporary loving

And I won't ever ever lie to you
I think you are the truth
I think I'd like to do some things to you
Our love is cool
Its cool

Under
It's love under the lights
Make love on the dance floor baby
Love under the lights, the lights, the lights tonight
Under, under, under, under...
