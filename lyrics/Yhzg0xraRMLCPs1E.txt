I heard the angels call again...
I threw myself a party - Chardonnay and Oxy.
I stopped the screams inside my head...
I remember when you had me,
Floating high like Sid and Nancy

They say it's not the answer, but I can't carry on,
'Cause I got nowhere, no one, without you boy, I'm done.
And when I'm gone, remember you're the one...
And just because I fight don't mean that I never learned how to love.

You know devils don't fly...
So don't expect me not to fall
Devils don't fly...
By God, we almost had it all

But I got chains and you got wings...
You know that life ain't fair sometimes
Devils don't fly...
But I try

What's a girl to do when she's not strong?
When everyone that holds my hand gets cut from all the thorns?
I used to put my ear against the wall
To hear the screams, to hear the fall
More reasons to escape it all

And it's not the answer, but I can't carry on...
I give my best smile, my last dime, but I always get it wrong.
It's not 'cause I'm young, or from a broken home...
Maybe I just fight 'cause I don't know where I belong.

You know devils don't fly...
So don't expect me not to fall
Devils don't fly...
By God, we almost had it all

But I got chains and you got wings...
You know that life ain't fair sometimes
Devils don't fly...
But I try

Angels were never meant to fall
And you were the loveliest of all
If I thought God could fix this, I'd pray for your forgiveness,
But I've been cast down, thrown out when I crossed to the other side...
You know devils don't fly...

You know devils don't fly...
So don't expect me not to fall
Devils don't fly...
By God, we almost had it all

But I got chains and you got wings...
You know that life ain't fair sometimes
Devils don't fly...
But I try
But I try
