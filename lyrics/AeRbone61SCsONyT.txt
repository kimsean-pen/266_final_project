All our times have come
Here, but now they're gone
The seasons don't fear the Reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain
And we can be like they are

Come on, baby... Don't fear the Reaper
Baby, take my hand... Don't fear the Reaper
We'll be able to fly... Don't fear the Reaper
Baby, I'm your man...

Valentine is done
Here, but now they're gone
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity...
Romeo and Juliet

40, 000 men and women every day...
Like Romeo and Juliet
40, 000 men and women every day...
Redefine happiness
Another 40, 000 coming every day...
We can be like they are

Come on, baby... Don't fear the Reaper
Baby, take my hand... Don't fear the Reaper
We'll be able to fly... Don't fear the Reaper
Baby, I'm your man...

Love of two is one
Here, but now they're gone
Came last night of sadness
It was clear we couldn't go on
The door was opened and the wind appeared
The candles blew and then disappeared
The curtains flew and then he appeared
Saying, "Don't be afraid"

Come on, baby... And we had no fear
And we ran to him... Then we started to fly
We looked backward and said goodbye
We had become like they are
We had taken his hand
We had become like they are

Come on, baby... Don't fear the Reaper
