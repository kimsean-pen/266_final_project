On a three hour flight from Memphis to L.A.
I was silently celebrating my first-class upgrade
Laughin' at my jeans and my boots
Beside those high dollar shoes and Armani suits

When the gentleman next to me said the drinks up here are free
So if you'd like the first one can be on me
He said I'm heading back from business in New York and Rome
Tell me son, where do you call home?

I said I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church
A court house clock that still don't work
Where a man's word means everything
Where moms and dads were high school flames
Gave their children grandmothers' maiden name
Yes it may not sound like much
But that's where I'm from

So we drank that round and then another
There wasn't a topic in this world we did not cover
He said I headed out west when I was barley nineteen
Just a kid, chasing my dreams

And I said I'm flying out here to pick up my big brother
He's been fighting the cancer they discovered
But he called last night and said I think this is the end
So come take me home to my family an my friends

Where the quarterback dates the homecoming queen
The trucks are ford and the tractors green
And amazing grace is what we'd sing
Where there's a county fair every fall
And your friends are there no matter when you call
Yeah it may not sound like much
But it's where I'm from

And as we stood to claim the bags we checked
He said I'll pray for your bother and did I mention
That Italian suits haven't always been my style?
See I was the quarterback of my high school team
We took state back in '63
And my wife well she still my home coming queen

Cause I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church
A court house clock that still don't work
Where a man's word means everything
Where moms and dads were high school flames
Gave their children grandmothers' maiden name
Yes it may not sound like much
I said it may not sound like much
But it's where I'm from (Amazing Grace)
It's where I'm from (Amazing Grace)
It's where I'm from (Amazing Grace)
How sweet the sound (Amazing Grace)
