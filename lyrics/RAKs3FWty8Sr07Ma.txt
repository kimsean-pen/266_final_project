All my life I wanted to be somebody and here I am! I know what I've got and there ain't nobody gonna take it away from me! So let me tell you what I am!

I'm a red hot fox, I can take the knocks
I'm a hammer from hell, honey can't you tell?

I'm the wild one
Yes I'm the wild one

I'm a touched up freak on a winning streak
I'm gonna own this town, you can't hold me down

I'm the wild one
Yes I'm the wild one

Well it ain't no use
Turn me loose
More more
I can't keep score

I've got my head screwed on and the days are gone
When you kept me down and you pushed me 'round

I'm the wild one
Yes I'm the wild one

I'm a blue eyed bitch and I wanna get rich
Get out of my way 'cause I'm here to stay

I'm the wild one
Yes I'm the wild one

Well it ain't no use
Turn me loose
More more
I can't keep score

Well it ain't no use
Turn me loose
More more
I can't keep score

I'm a red hot fox, I can take the knocks
I'm a hammer from hell, honey can't you tell?

I'm the wild one
Yes I'm the wild one

I'm a touched up freak on a winning streak
I'm gonna own this town, you can't hold me down

I'm the wild one
Yes I'm the wild one
I'm the wild one
Yes I'm the wild one
The wild one
Yes I'm the wild one
I'm the wild one
Yes I'm the wild one
I'm the wild one
Yes I'm the wild one
