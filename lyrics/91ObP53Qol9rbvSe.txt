I want to twist your skin
I want to feel it
Just how flexible it is
Maybe someday I will eventually know
It's not as easy as it seems

I know it's hard to let go
A certain standard you've created
And I've fallen below
I know it's hard to let go
A certain level you've created
And how to reach it?
I don't know

I hope you never let our love descend
Can you please promise me that we will always be friends?
I need this
I need you
And if you ever want to know what it's like to be alone
Just ask me

I'm the example of a lost human being
Maybe what moved you is what's moving me
Time heals all wounds sounds so confusing
Maybe what moved you is what's moving me
It's the littlest things

I won't forget the day
We took off our clothes in the rain
Danced until the morning came
But the memory remains

You were drenched down to the bone
I was so cold yet so warm
A final frail hug on this plateau
Seconds before you had to go

You were drenched down to the bone
I was so cold yet so warm
We went inside and dried out the night
Everything is gone but the memory remains
