China all the way to New York
I can feel the distance getting close
You're right next to me but I need an air plane
I can feel the distance as you breathe

And sometimes I think you want me to touch you
Well, how can I when you build the Great Wall around you
In your eyes I saw a future together
Oh you just look away in the distance

China decorates our table
Funny how the cracks don't seem to show
Pour the wine, dear, you say we'll take vacation
But we never can agree on where to go

And sometimes I think you want to me to touch you
But how can I when you build the Great Wall around you
In your eyes I saw a future together
Oh you just look away in the distance

Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, oh yes
Ah ah, oh, I know you love to hit me, boy
Oh yeah, you love to hit me boy, oh

China all the way to New York

Maybe you got lost in Mexico
You're right next to me, I think that you can hear me
Funny how the distance learns to grow
Sometimes I think you want me to touch you
Well, how can I, yes when you build the Great Wall around you
In your eyes I saw a future together
You just look away in the distance
I can feel the distance
I can feel the distance
I can feel the distance getting close
