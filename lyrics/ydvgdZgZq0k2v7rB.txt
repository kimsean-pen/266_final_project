Separate the crowd, we stand alone together
Burning bridges for the better in this fire
What I see in me, I see it in another
I will treat you like a brother in this

I've been here a thousand times before
Your house is on fire and you're painting the walls
If I've been here a thousand times then can I call it home?
Had to break an entry, find acceptance
Hold on to the only thing that I swear I won't forget
There's no right thing you're supposed to be
No right story you're supposed to believe
There's a language we all speak

Separate the crowd, we stand alone together
Burning bridges for the better in this fire
What I see in me, I see it in another
I will treat you like a brother in this

I've been here a thousand times before
Your house is on fire and you're painting the walls
It's just another nightmare
This vicious cycle got us feeling like it's too late
Nightmare: "We're only human" doesn't resonate with me no more

Separate the crowd, we stand alone together
Burning bridges for the better in this fire
What I see in me, I see it in another
I will treat you like a brother in this
Are we just stating the obvious
Breaking our promises
Like you said we always would?
We've dug this ground before
And it's nothing but a wasteland apocalypse
And now we're just passengers
We've come too far, we can't turn this around

We used to live, now all we do is analyze
False promises, empty threats, now we've got nothing left
We want to redeem but we won't unhand the knife
Can't you see story eyes?
You blink when you lie

We used to live, now all we do is analyze
False promises, empty threats, now we've got nothing left
We want to redeem but we won't unhand the knife
Can't you see story eyes?
You blink when you lie
