When the night meets the dawn
One will stand, one will fall
Broken I can't go on
An act of despair is what I seek

Give me your love tonight
You're burning up but I'm still cold
Give me a place to hide
From this horrendous emptiness inside

Can you help me?

I wanna feel your touch in the night
Unpure is my dark delight
What a lustful sight before these eyes, oh, darling
I'm gonna feel the wrath of the king
'Cause touching you was a sin
I'm a victim of my own desire

Was my destiny decided by the hand of god?
Staring at memories will I find the answer there?
Will I?
Here I am in the dark chained to demise and agony
Madness is creeping in
'Cause what I see cannot be real
Or can it?

I wanna feel your touch in the night
Unpure is my dark delight
What a lustful sight before these eyes, oh, darling
I'm gonna feel the wrath of the king
'Cause touching you was a sin
I'm a victim of my own desire

I can't resist you no more
Take me to heaven before I am gone

I wanna feel your touch in the night
Unpure is my dark delight
What a lustful sight before these eyes, oh, darling
I'm gonna feel the wrath of the king
'Cause touching you was a sin
I'm a victim of my own desire

I wanna feel your touch in the night
Unpure is my dark delight
What a lustful sight before these eyes, oh, darling
I'm gonna feel the wrath of the king
'Cause touching you was a sin
I'm a victim of my own desire
