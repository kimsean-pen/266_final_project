When I took you out
I knew what you were all about
But when I did
I didn't mean to turn you on
Now I bring you home
You tell me good nights not enough for you
I'm sorry, baby
I didn't mean to turn you on
Woah, I didn't mean to turn you on
You read me wrong
I wasn't tryin' to lead you on
Not like you think
I didn't mean to turn you on
I know you
Expected a one-night-stand when I refused
I knew you wouldn't understand
I'm sorry, baby
I didn't mean to turn you on
I told you twice
I was only tryin' to be nice
Only tryin' to be nice
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on
Hey, now why should I
Feel guilty 'cause I won't give
Guilty 'cause I won't give in
I didn't mean to turn you on
Woah, I didn't mean to turn you on
When I took you out
I knew what you were all about
But when I did
I didn't mean to turn you on
Woah, I didn't mean to turn you on
I didn't mean to turn you on (9)
