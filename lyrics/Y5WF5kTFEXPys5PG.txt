After the rain the temperature dropt
And covered in ice was my window top
I say goodbye I wave my hand
As a thousand doves fly
Across the blackened night

After the rain we forget
We make sure we gain then we leave it
Cause were a nation of forgetters
Oh after the rain we pretend
It's easier to begin without looking back

Cause all at once air so thin
And there's nothing left to breath in

After the rain we forget
After the rain we forget

Behind a dream so rosy and red a pile of things to forget
A voice of the past tiptoes in a cracking ghost whispering

After the rain we forget
We make sure we gain then we leave it
Cause were a nation of forgetters

After the rain we forget
After the rain we forget

People where have you been
Have you been hiding
In you big houses
People after the rain
Will your life
Will it ever be the same
Oh people what will you do
When you luck
When it turns on you
Wow people after the rain
Will your life
Will it ever be the same

After the rain we forget
After the rain we forget
After the rain we forget
