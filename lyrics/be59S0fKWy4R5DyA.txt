I go out in the nighttime
Take the Broad Ridge line
China Town glows bright
On any night
Wasted memory
Pressing down on me
Taking all my time
I go out in the nighttime
To fill the hole in my heart

Another go with the nighttime girls
To remind myself of you
She smiles in the neon glow

I go out in the nighttime
I take the trolley line
All the lights glow
Every night
Wasted memory
Washing over me
Taking all my time
I go out in the nighttime
To fill the hole in my heart

Another go with the nighttime girls
To remind myself of you
She smiles in the neon glow

Another go with the nighttime girls
To remind myself of you
She smiles in the neon glow

Another go with the nighttime girls
