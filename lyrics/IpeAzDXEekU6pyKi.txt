So why do I warn you?
I see things when I hold you,
But I've whispered it's all right
It was you and me and a long night

You're a ghost in the doorway
I can see through
But I hold tight
Understand holding till it hurts
I just want you here and you're lovely

You're a ghost in the doorway
I can see through
But I hold tight
Understand holding until it hurts
I just want you here and you're lovely

Don't worry, nothing can go wrong
Don't worry, nothing can go wrong
Don't worry, nothing can go wrong
Don't worry, nothing can go wrong
