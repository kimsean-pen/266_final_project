40 over down the Queensway
It's been a long day
Still I'm holding up
(Somehow that's easy to say)
Been a lot of negativity that I don't really need
Still I soak it up
(Somehow it's easy that way)

Skin on skin
Tell me I'm gonna get it right this time
Skin on skin
Numb to everyone
Your hand in mine

She's a Midwest beauty waiting all alone for me
(Searching for words to relate)
Kinda hoping when I get there
Just want a night alone with you
(I'm getting carried away)
40 miles and an old front door
Been a long, long drive
But somehow it's easy

Skin on skin
Tell me I'm gonna get it right this time
Skin on skin
Numb to everyone your hand in mine
When I remember how I feel
When you're standing in the moonlight
I stayed up all night
And I know I feel like it's what the world would be like
If we all breathe in the stars like you do

Smile on me from across the room
Reprehending me the way you do
With your hazel eyes, so peculiar to you
Smile on me from across the room
Reprehending me the way you do
With your hazel eyes, so peculiar to you

Skin on skin
Tell me I'm gonna get it right this time
Skin on skin
Numb to everyone your hand in mine
When I remember how I feel
When you're standing in the moonlight
I stayed up all night
And I know I feel like it's what the world would be like
If we all breathe in the stars like you do

She's a Midwest beauty waiting all alone
