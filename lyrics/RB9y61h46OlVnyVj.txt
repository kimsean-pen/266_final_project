Before the salt and roiling sea
The moon began to cry
The valley ran with sorrowful tears
And filled the waters high
The misty morning over the brine
Belies a leaden sky
The stars all hide away from the chill
Until the evening rise
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
The place where Plurnes scuttled her foe
The Doomed Ship still resides
The titan met her end on its prow
Forsaken by the tides
In death she leaves her stain on the place
The tempest never dies
Her final throes in shivers and shakes
A thousand years gone by
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
