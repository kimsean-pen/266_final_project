We are all soured milk
When we look in the mirror
We collapse
When our time has come
When our finger's on the trigger
We collapse

Arms are flailing
Swirling like the poison in the sink

Like the southern belle
Playing songs of horror
Like teeth amongst the grass
Like the bullet shell
Whistle and then I'll hum
Watch the good folks run

We are all rotten fruit
When the pipeline starts to flowing
We collapse
When our time has come
When the courtyard needs a lynching
We collapse

Arms are flailing
The devils' in the eye of every man

Water and the well
A Baptist and a baby
Were rolling in the weeds
Keep her spirit well
The tar pit daughter's father
Will lay her out to dry
