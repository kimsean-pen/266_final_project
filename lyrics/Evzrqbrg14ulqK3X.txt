I could get you down
Fully loaded, fully loaded with my face up in the clouds
I could find a town
Trade the city for a place where I can keep the pressure down
Got to save some face
Tired of pleasing all the players when they wind up in the chase
Got to be a place
Where our shoulders won't be burning by the burning of the blaze

I've been waiting on the summer
I'll take you there
Come with me and get some colour
I'll bleach my hair
If you go and find a lover
Everyone shares
I've been waiting on the summer
I'll take you there

Go and build your tribe and let them decide
Where they willing, what the rules are, just swallow your pride
Take a look inside and let them describe
I'm a doctor, it's your weakness, let you seek and you will find
That you will find

I've been waiting on the summer
I'll take you there
Come with me and get some colour
I'll bleach my hair
If you go and find a lover
Everyone shares
I've been waiting on the summer
I'll take you there

The summer comes so slow
And moves too fast
And when you're young, you don't ever know
How long it lasts
The summer comes so slow
And moves too fast

I've been waiting on the summer
I'll take you there
Come with me and get some colour
I'll bleach my hair
If you go and find a lover
Everyone shares
I've been waiting on the summer
I'll take you there
