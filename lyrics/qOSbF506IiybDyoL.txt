Help me off your back
I found it's so futile to attack
So what else you got
You won't tell the truth until you're caught

I'll be in your room, you'll be comin' soon
I'll be gone all day grab it that's your way

I wish I could pretend
But you'll fire one off at me again
Revenge me, now don't it seem like
You're a little sweet

In your room, who was willing? Got to assume
Felt too hard, pain is chilling, caught off guard
And now should I fall apart?

I'll be in your room, you'll be comin' soon
Take it out of me, grab it that's your scene

Well, I'm not feeling well
It's not goin' so good, oh can't you tell?
It's a crazy time
Fire one off at me and I'll be fine

In your room, who was willing? Got to assume
Felt too hard, pain is chilling, caught off guard
Sooner should I fall apart?

It's so crazed, you were swingin'
Still amazed, what's in your laugh?
You're still swingin', you're so unfazed
I'd no idea you'd go this far

If I look back, would you hear?
If that's what you decide to believe
