Once more we're thrust
into the vacuum
of god's yawning maw
A dream of human debt repaid.
In fear you live and breath and wait and sleep.
Chambers under asphalt buried far beneath the boiling streets.
There is not a hand to save you from the hunter's net.
Society is a blister on the skin of the planet.
Man is a pustule on the face of the Earth.
Grace is a harbor for human ugliness.
Free will is a barrel in the celestial mouth.
When Atom splits
and the genome melts.
Will Cain cradle Abel?!
Sudden death!!!!
