Feeling empty, tears in my eyes
Twisted thoughts they try
To interfere with my will to keep going
The time has come for me
To be one timeless
Ageless, innocent, calm
My ship is calling

Talk to me, speak to me
Tell me your story
Look at me, watch me
See and behold

Remember me, think of me
Picture me, never forget me
Cherish my memory

Come to me, wait for me
Tell me your story
Look at me, watch me
See and behold

Remember me, think of me
Picture me, never forget me
You must remember me

In my hair I felt a thousand suns
A thousand clouds kept me warm
And carried me through the sky
I've finally got the sign

The lights of souls
Are glowing like gold
Storm is rising, the calm is gone
My ship is sailing

Talk to me, speak to me
Tell me your story
Look at me, watch me
See and behold

Remember me, think of me
Picture me, never forget me
Cherish my memory

Come to me, wait for me
Tell me your story
Look at me, watch me
See and behold

Remember me, think of me
Picture me, never forget me
You must remember me

Talk to me, speak to me
Tell me your story
Look at me, watch me
See and behold

Remember me, think of me
Picture me, never forget me
Cherish my memory

Come to me, wait for me
Tell me your story
Look at me, watch me
See and behold

Remember me, think of me
Picture me, never forget me
You must remember me
