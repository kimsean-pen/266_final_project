The only joy that I knew
Sorrow was here name
My tears were for her life
But not her death

So now I sleep for ages
In obsessive dreams
My deeds were all but
Laments of my wrath

I overcome dimensions
Through horizons way beyond
I dismember
Dreams in December

Love is the Devil - and I am in Love
I think I'm gonna be sad
Infinite moonlight now awakes me

Love is the Devil - and I am in Love
I think I'm gonna be sad
Infinite moonlight now awakes me
