There's more of you and me
Than a desperate thief could ever set free
I'm your burden

Selfishness is inherited
Like skinny lips and tattoos
(What could I do?)

Sorry for leaving
I'm sorry with one foot out the door
I'm unapologetically sorry for everything

All of your best attributes
Look better on me than they ever did on you
We could be each other's other burden

Selfishness is inherited
So, what could I do? (What could I do?)
I didn't catch it kissing Jenny in the closet
I didn't learn it at school

I'm sorry you need me
For hanging on your arm, a child you can't ignore
I'm unapologetically sorry for everything
I'm sorry for aging
Growing more and more disinterested in celebrity and politic
I'm unapologetically more
Maybe more than anything, sorry you love me
