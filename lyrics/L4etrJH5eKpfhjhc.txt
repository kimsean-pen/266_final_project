Like a bullet in my chest,
You're written, bound and etched
Forever in my mind

We are fading in our hands
Lost somewhere in a wasteland
Not knowing up from down

But when the walls are caving
And the world keeps turning
We got the love, we got to love

Now I will never let you go
All the words won't make me fold
It is never easy
I'll follow you, Apollo

Now I will never let you go
Give it time and we will grow
Ain't no fun in easy
I'll follow you, Apollo
I'll follow you, Apollo

I wear my heart on my sleeve
You do the same for me
When autumn comes around

But when the walls are caving
And the world keeps turning
We got the love, we got to love

Now I will never let you go
All the words won't make me fold
It is never easy
I'll follow you, Apollo

Now I will never let you go
Give it time and we will grow
Ain't no fun in easy
I'll follow you, Apollo
I'll follow you-u

So don't pull the rug from underneath us
We're in trouble babe, but we got the love
Don't pull the rug from underneath us
Crashing down fast, as fragile as glass

But what are we now if we never tried?
What are we now?

I will never let you go
Give it time and we will grow
It is not supposed to be easy

Now I will never let you go
Give it time and we will grow
Ain't no fun in easy
I'll follow you, Apollo
I'll follow you, Apollo

You, Apollo
It is never easy
I'll follow you, Apollo
I'll follow you, Apollo

You, Apollo
It is never easy
I'll follow you, Apollo
I'll follow you, Apollo
