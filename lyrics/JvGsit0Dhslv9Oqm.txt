(They wanna tear you down, but they don't want you to be down)
(Gettin' caught up, makes you feel dizzy)
(I'll be honest with you)
Fuck it!

Another day (Another day), another night (Another night)
Another fucking battle in my mind
A lotta love (Lotta love), a lotta hate (Lotta hate)
A lot who wanna see me unwind
I'm feelin' low (Feelin' low), all alone (All alone)
"Now get your shit together" is what I'm told
Been feelin' low (Feelin' low), super low (Super low)
And they won't even care til I'm ghost (Yeah)

Used to dream of the top, had nightmares at the bottom
Til I realized at the bottom is the top when forgotten
Pray I don't fall, like autumn
When you feel more like a product than a person, there's a problem
Been feelin' so low, I don't want no one to know
I just need somethin' to cope
Leave me alone, told 'em all, "Leave me alone"
Then wonder, "Where do they go?"
Been here before, push away people I love
Just so they never get close
End of my rope, I don't think anyone care
Maybe they will when I go
Maybe they'll talk about me on the internet ('Net)
They never care, only care when they benefit (Yeah)
Introvert honestly out of my element (Yeah)
Still I'm afraid of becoming irrelevant (Oh, yeah)
Pay attention to the ones who don't clap when you win
If they lie to you once, then they'll do it again
Knew the hurt will come back, I just didn't know when
And the night of the crash, I thought it was the end
All it takes is a moment to alter a life
And I thought about that for the rest of the night
Am I makin' a difference with things that I write?
Just a human, you don't know the demons I fight, so

Another day (Another day), another night (Another night)
Another fucking battle in my mind
A lotta love (Lotta love), a lotta hate (Lotta hate)
A lot who wanna see me unwind
I'm feelin' low (Feelin' low), all alone (All alone)
"Now get your shit together" is what I'm told
Been feelin' low (Feelin' low), super low (Super low)
And they won't even care til I'm ghost (Yeah)

You say I'm the worst
They say I'm the best
But call me tonight when you get off of work
Got things on my chest
I've been feeling bad for the feelings I have
I know that I'm blessed
Been learning that money just isn't the cure
For feeling depressed, I know I digress
I've been a mess, honestly, I've been a mess
Hate what I think in my head
Act like a friend, then when I need you the most
That's when you leave me on read
Have to pretend, always just have to pretend
Like I don't care what it said
Stuck in my head, plenty of things I could do
I just go lay in my bed, damn

Don't really know why I'm feelin' so low (Low)
Where do you go when there's nowhere to go? (Go)
They talk and they talk and I know they don't know (Know)
What it's like when your heart becomes empty and cold
How do I know what's real when my mind questions all I know?
How do I save myself from myself when I'm feelin' low?
How do I flip the page if I'm stuck reading what I've wrote?
Why do I always drown in my thoughts? Need to learn to float!

Another day (Another day), another night (Another night)
Another fucking battle in my mind
A lotta love (Lotta love), a lotta hate (Lotta hate)
A lot who wanna see me unwind
I'm feelin' low (Feelin' low), all alone (All alone)
"Now get your shit together" is what I'm told
Been feelin' low (Feelin' low), super low (Super low)
And they won't even care til I'm ghost
