Because he missed the scenery
The native dances and the charming songs
But wait a minute, something's wrong

He-hey mambo, mambo italiano
Go, go, go, you mixed up a siciliano
All you calabresi do the mambo like-a crazy with the

Hey mambo, don't wanna tarantella
He-hey mambo, no more mozzarella
Hey mambo, mambo italiano
Try an enchilada with the fishy baccalà

Then hey cumpà, I love-a how you dance the rumba
But take-a some advice, paesano, learn-a how to mambo
If you're gonna be a square, you ain't-a gonna go nowhere

Hey mambo, mambo italiano
He-hey mambo, mambo italiano
Go, go, Joe, shake like a giovane
Hello che si dice? You get happy in the pizza
When you mambo italiano

Just make it with a bit, bambino
It's like-a vino
Kid, you good looking but you don't know what's-a cooking 'til you

Hey mambo, mambo italiano
He-hey mambo, mambo italiano
Ho, ho, ho, you mixed up a siciliano
Hello che si dice? You get happy in the pizza when you
Mambo italiano
