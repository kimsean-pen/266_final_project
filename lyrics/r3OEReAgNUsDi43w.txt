Here by my side
Are you close enough to take me to your paradise
Or am I going down to my loneliness
Could you be loving me more or less

Do you know
Are you ready for the feeling
Can you learn to grow
Out in a world of tears we,
We're hanging on
We come together,
We find the sun

(you all over me, all over)
You're the light
I am the love don't let me die away
(die away)
I am forever we are born to make
Promises to be there
(promises to be there)
Promises to be there

Life, where the few may not ever find a heaven
I could be with you
Out in a world where nights they don't ever end
We got each other my love, my life, my friend
You all over me, all over
You're the light
I am the love don't let me die away
I am forever we are born to make
Promises to love me

(promises to love me)
Promises to love me

Out in a world where nights they don't ever ever end
We got each other my love, my life, my friend

You all over me, all over
You're the light
I am the love don't let me die away
I am forever we are born to make
Promises to be there
(promises to be there)
Promises to be there
Yeah... yeah... yeeeeeeeeah
(die away)
I am the love don't let me die away
I am forever we are born to make
Promises...

Promises to be there)
Promises to be there
