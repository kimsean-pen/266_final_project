We so on the low baby
You's a professional liar
(And I like that)

So much hiding so much secrets
So much messing around in the shadows
But in the light were just friends, no
Never let anyone in so

Tell your girls you don't want me
Tell your girls we're not fucking
Tell your girls your not getting it
Tell them that you're not interested
Tell your girls it ain't right
Tell them I'm not yo type
Tell the girls it don't work like that
Tell your girls your don't want me bad

Said I thought about it how do we keep this loving
Thought about it
Thought about it
Said I thought about it how do we keep this loving
Thought about thought about

Yeah when I get you alone
You drop all of the fronting yeah
When I get you alone
We don't talk we just touching yeah
When I get you alone it's a whole different story yeah
When I get you alone it's a whole different story yeah

I just got your phone call
Told me to come through
(Riding)
Said your missing someone
Up in yo bed
Imma be there
Pulled up to the crib now
I'm up in the room
Told me to keep it down
(Quiet)
Cause you don't want them knowing
BUT I. just. wanna looove you!
No one will find out the truth
(So don't worry baby)

Tell your girls you don't want me
Tell your girls we're not fucking
Tell your girls your not getting it
Tell them that you're not interested
Tell your girls it ain't right
Tell them I'm not yo type
Tell the girls it don't work like that
Tell your girls your don't want me bad

Said I thought about it how do we keep this loving
Thought about it
Thought about it
Said I thought about it how do we keep this loving
Thought about thought about

Yeah when I get you alone
You drop all of the fronting yeah
When I get you alone
We don't talk we just touching yeah
When I get you alone it's a whole different story yeah
