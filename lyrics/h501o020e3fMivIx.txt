Hey pretty baby
I just don't know
What you're looking for
Why don't you
Try explaining
And maybe this time we can be more than a
Simple acquaintance
Or a random knock on the door
They tell me
I'll make it
And that you're really not worth the troubling over

Maybe you're not one in a million
You're as common as everyone else
Baby you're not that one in a million
Why why can't i see it tell me?
Why am i kneeling?

I cry
But not alone and not in the night
I'm brighter than light and I've shown you
What my inside is like
But you still can't tell me you choose to shut me out of your life
Oh, you're so clever and always manage to win the last bite

Maybe you're not one in a million
You're as common as everyone else
Baby you're not that one in a million
Why why can't i see it tell me?
Why am I kneeling?

Boy, you're not one in a million
Why why can't i see it tell me?
Why am I kneeling?
Boy, I'm that one in a million
But you can't see it...
