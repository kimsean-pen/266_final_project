Mediocrity surrounds you
Evil (People?) pressing down around you
There's nowhere else to go but down and out.

Buy a gun,
Steal a car.
Have a ball,
Won't get far.
Pretty soon you'll find you've found your place.

It's a kid's world anyway
Pay your moral finer day???
Who knows, this sho might be your last
Keep it loaded just in case
The world moves so much faster these days

Find souvenirs to show your kids.

It gets better as it gets light,
And you've had, the greatest night
on earth
Just to have it taken from you
Mark it in, and sewn back on you???
It's cheap, but cheapness hurts.

It's a kid's world anyway
Pay your moral finer day???
Who knows, this sho might be your last
Keep it loaded just in case
The world moves so much faster these days

Find souvenirs to show their kids.
