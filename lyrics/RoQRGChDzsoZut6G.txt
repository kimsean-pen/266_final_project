Know it's been a hard day on the block
Overtime and the bills don't stop
'Member what we said back in June
If we still here now then we gotta move
I don't know what you wanna do next
Got your job but you got no checks
I'm not saying that I got a plan now
I'm just saying that hey

I know we got some problems, yea
I know we got some hangups
I'm not tryin'a make excuses
I'm just tryin'a put some meaning to the
Struggles that we're currently
Going through with currency
Going through with family
It's finally like we're finally saying

They own this town
Maybe thats why we get no ground
We could go if we don't it's a pity 'cause
I could tell you it'll change but it never does

They own this town
Maybe thats why we get knocked down
We could leave in the morning and go all night
Take a train to the coast get a new life

I've been looking at the photos too
Three years and we got so cool
Too many ways we coulda' blown it
One minute and we coulda' thrown it all away
I don't know what I wanna do next
Got a dream but I got no contacts
You're the reason that I got this far
And I know we gotta work so hard I

I know we got some problems yea
I know we got some hangups
I'm not tryin'a make excuses
I'm just tryin'a to put some meaning to the
Struggles that we're currently
Going through with currency
Going through with family
It's finally like we're finally saying

It's coming the moment we waited for so long
We have it, we're on it, we'll have it, I promise
It's coming the moment we waited for so long
We have it, we're on it, we'll have it, I promise
