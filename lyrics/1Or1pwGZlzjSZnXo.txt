Our nation must once again answer a question:
Is now a good time to talk about gun violence in this country?
There are nearly 13,000 gun homicides a year in the US
On an average day, 96 Americans are killed with guns
Seven of them are children

Was protection worth
When the things we're using to protect ourselves
Are killing others
Killing us, our people, killing our children
And you ain't affected by that?
Fuck this thing up

And yes I am from the hood
Yes I am anti-gun
See, I stay on my born shit
But I was not born to run
And did you really think that we was gon' let this shit go?
Well did you really think that we wasn't fit to explode?

Pull the trigger or get shot
Pull the trigger or get shot
Pull the trigger or get shot
Run motherfucker, run motherfucker, run

See I'm trying to flip the script
You act like it can't be done
Got seventeen bodies now
Your conscience must weigh a ton
But did you really shit that we was gon' let this shit go?
Well did you really think that we wasn't fit to explode?

Pull the trigger or get shot
Pull the trigger or get shot
Pull the trigger or get shot
Run motherfucker, run motherfucker, run
Pull the trigger or get shot
Pull the trigger or get shot
Pull the trigger or get shot
Run motherfucker, run motherfucker, run

Now are you anti-that?
Because I'm anti-this
Now are you anti-that?
Because I'm anti-this, oh

Pull the trigger or get shot
Pull the trigger or get shot
Pull the trigger or get shot
Run motherfucker, run motherfucker, run
Pull the trigger or get shot
Pull the trigger or get shot
Pull the trigger or get shot
Run motherfucker, run motherfucker, run
Pull the trigger or get shot
Pull the trigger or get shot
Pull the trigger or get shot
Run motherfucker, run motherfucker, run, fuck
