Well, this car is automatic, it's systematic, it's hydromatic
Why it's Greased Lightning!
We'll get some overhead lifters and four barrel quads, oh yeah
(keep talking, woah, keep talking)

A fuel injection cut off and chrome plated rods, oh yeah
(I'll get the money, I'll kill to get the money)
With a four-speed on the floor, they'll be waitin' at the door
You know that it ain't shit, we'll be gettin' lots of tit, greased lightnin'
Go go go, go go go go go go go go
Go, greased lightnin', you're burnin' up the quarter mile
(Greased lightnin', go, greased lightnin')

Go, greased lightnin', you're coasting through the heat lap trials
Greased lightnin', go, greased lightnin')
You are supreme, the chicks'll cream, for greased lightnin'
Go go go, go go go go go go go go
We'll get some purple pitched tail lights and thirty inch fins, oh yeah
A palomino dashboard and duel-muffler twins, oh yeah
With new boosters, plates and shocks, I can get off my rocks

You know that I ain't braggin', she's a real pussy wagon
Greased lightnin'
Go, greased lightnin', you're burning up the quarter mile
(Greased lightnin', go, greased lightnin')
Go, greased lightnin', you're coasting through the heat lap trials

(Go, greased lightnin', go, greased lightnin')
You are supreme, the chicks'll cream, for greased lightnin'
...
Go, greased lightnin', you're burnin' up the quarter mile
(Greased lightnin', go, greased lightnin')
Go, greased lightnin', you're coasting through the heat lap trials
(Greased lightnin', go, greased lightnin')
You are supreme, the chicks'll cream, for greased lightnin'
Lightnin', lightnin', lightnin',
Lightnin, lightnin', lightnin, lightnin', lightnin'!
