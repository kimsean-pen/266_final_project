Consumed with memories that preceded today
Given a chance to bereave life that's slipping away

Suffered through tragedy of my slow decay
Deceptive tendencies dragged my soul away

All that I know there was no god for me
Force that shatters all, absence of mortality

Revive all my fears
Revive wasted tears
Revive void within
Revive once again...

Forsaken by destiny, forsaken by my own mind
I must remove my skin to see belief in your eyes

All that I know there was no god for me
Force that shatters all, absence of humanity

Revive all my fears
Revive wasted tears
Revive void within
Revive once again...

Revive all my fears
Revive wasted tears
Revive void within
Revive once again...

Reach for the sky
Touch the sky
Revive a hope
For mankind
