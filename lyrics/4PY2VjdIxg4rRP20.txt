Leaves are on the ground
Fall has come
Blue skies turning grey
Like my love

I tried to carry you
And make you whole
But it was never enough
I must go

And who is gonna save you
When I'm gone
And who'll watch over you
When I'm gone

You say you cared for me
But hide it well
How can you love
Someone not yourself

And who is gonna save you
When I'm gone
And who'll watch over you
When I'm gone

And when I'm gone
Who'll break your fall
Who will you blame?
I can't go on and
Let you lose it all
More than I can take
Who'll ease your pain?
Ease your pain

And who is gonna save
You when I'm gone
And who watch over you

And who will give you strength
When you're not strong
Who'll watch over you
When I'm gone away?

Snow is on the ground
Winter's come
You long to hear my voice
But I'm long gone
