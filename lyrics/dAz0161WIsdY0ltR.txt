Started off
A thousand miles of interstate
The sun was setting right in my hands
Staying up
Swore that I would be okay
With compromises made in my head
But I lost my grip
So I let her slip
We had a little love once
But now it's in danger
We got a little lost, babe
But that's human nature
Now it's too late to save us
Oh, 'cause now she's a stranger
Fake a smile
So no one else could recognize
The broken heart
That's under my skin
Say goodbye
Tried to swim
But came to find no water
When I went diving in
And I lost my grip
So I let her slip
We had a little love once
But now it's in danger
We got a little lost, babe
But that's human nature
Now it's too late to save us
Oh, 'cause now she's a stranger
Now we're back to where we started
Now we're back to where we started
Right back to strangers
We had a little love once
But now it's in danger
We got a little lost, babe
But that's human nature
Now it's too late to save us
Oh, 'cause now she's a stranger
(She's long gone, she's long gone)
(Now we're back to where we started, strangers)
