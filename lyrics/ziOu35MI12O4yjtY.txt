I am the blackest soul
The child of a loveless world
The wreckage left in the wake of time
I am the consequence of complete collapse

I am the horror you created
The mind fuck you instigated
I am the seed of self-destruction
The bitter taste of life's regret

Flood my lungs
Pull my teeth
Cross my eyes

Until there's nothing left
There's nothing left
There's nothing left

Casualties to the snares of modern life
Anchored by avarice
There is no further
Left to sink

I reside in my mind's eye
Yet see no truth
In a world of lies

I reside in my mind's eye
We are adrift
In a world of lies

Flood my lungs
Pull my teeth
Cross my eyes
Until there's nothing left

I am the blackest soul
The child of a loveless world
I am the consequence

Of complete collapse
Collapse
Collapse

I am the blackest soul
I am the blackest soul
I am the blackest soul
I am the blackest soul.
