I'm going home
and when i want to go home, i'm going mobile
well i'm gonna find a home on wheels, see how it feels,
goin' mobile
keep me moving
I can pull up by the curb,
i can make it on the road,
goin' mobile
i can stop in any street
and talk with people that we meet
goin' mobile
keep me moving
Out in the woods
or in the city
it's all the same to me
when i'm driving free
the world's my home
when i'm mobile
Play the tape machine
make the toast and tea
when i'm mobile
well, i can lay in bed with only highway ahead
when i'm mobile
keep me moving
Keep me moving
over fifty
keep me groovin'
just a hippie gypsy
come on move now
movin'
keep me movin' yeah
Keep me movin', movin', movin', yeah

mobile, mobile, mobile, mobile...
I don't care about pollution
i'm an air-conditioned gypsy
that's my solution
watch the police and the taxman miss me!
i'm mobile!
