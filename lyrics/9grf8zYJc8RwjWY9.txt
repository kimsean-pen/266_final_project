Move that way
You got that whole room, just to the floor now
Your sweet summer form, come what may
You got that boom on
So alive and I prove you so right

Prove myself on my private beach
And I'll be the sweat in the flow
Watch that water we're waiting slow
And deep breath ahead in the low

I swim with you in the low tide
Breathing high life
Stay forever, forever the right side
Don't let go
I'll be the wave that you ride

The rough so tight
I'll make you silk lines
Nowhere to be and you spin the rewind
The shimmer light, I see them bones bright
Come get kaleidoscope high girl, you and I
Dream of woman, my deeper end
And I'll be the stairs that you know
The thrill I dive in, you got that sun
I swear you're the only one

I swim with you in the low tide
Breathing high life
Stay forever, forever the right side
Don't let go
I'll be the wave that you ride End
