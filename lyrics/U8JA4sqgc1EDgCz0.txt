Waiting for a friend of mine
I was wasting time
Lying here by the phone
I'm all alone

When you took your love away
All my skies are gray
Never thought you'd leave my side
Tear in my eye

Do you know him?
Do you know him?

Walk the city streets at night
Such a pretty sight
When it's dark on the inside
Where are you now

Since you left me do you know
Where you're going to
Searching for that precious light
That's guiding you

Did you know him?
Come talk to me
Did you know him?
I'm asking you
Do you know him?
Gotta look at me
Do you know him?

To love him is to know him
To know him is to love him
If you love him then you know him
If you know him then you loved him
To know him is to love him
To love him is to know him
If you show him that you love him
If you love him then you know him
