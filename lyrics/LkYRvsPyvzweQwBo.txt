Stuck in self pity
Anger filling the void
Rapid expansion of the sinful city
The darkness being my call

Strangers walking in my home
Sounds of you not there

Never seen the night so dark
I lack the will to care
All alone in city lights
Where you absorb the echo

Taste the layers of my heart
See it shatter
Mute the voice

No direction
No final call
Alone to make the right choice

Bound for terminal descent
Sacred simple mark
Devoted little testament
Every simple spark

Keeping it together
For my own sake
Retain any sudden urge
Defy the high stake
