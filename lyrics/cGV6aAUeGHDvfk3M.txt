To the heat of a foreign sun,
Warm my love safe in your arms.
And the choirs of the air and sea,
Spend your love to sail home to me.
I saw her blue eyes candid in the headlight - she's got a new style,
I saw her white smile digging in the goldmine - for a new life.

This killing time is going to bruise forever,
So turn it back - better late than never.
I saw her white smile digging in the goldmine,
Girl you look tired,
Even love,
Is it even ever?

I go out and you wear it all,
To see that life goes on, if I'm there or not.
I saw (...) on the street,
Hoping when your guilt builds up, I'll find you at my feet.

I saw her blue eyes candid in the headlight - she's got a new style,
I saw her white smile digging in the goldmine - for a new life.

This killing time is going to bruise forever,
So turn it back - better late than never.
I saw her white smile digging in the goldmine,
Girl you look tired,
Even love,
Is it even ever?
Even love,
Even love.

I saw her white smile digging in the goldmine,
Girl you look tired,
Even love,
Even love.
Even love,
I saw her white smile digging in the goldmine
Girl you look tired.
