Oh, say something, I'm not
Oh, nothing, nothing at all

Don't wanna waste time, goodnight
Don't wanna say things we might
Get tomorrow, wake up be like, nothing
Don't wanna leave you like this
I think there's something we missed
The moment I think of it
I realise it's nothing

I'll never be a safety net
It doesn't matter what you get, go
So go on and place a bet
You'll never be a winner, babe, I know
I'll never be a safety net
It doesn't matter what you get, go
So go on and place a bet
I'll never be a winner, babe, I know

Oh, love is
You and me
Will never be
Safety net

Don't wanna say a thing, oh I
Don't wanna talk about it
Weekends and nights
Can probably live without it
What I'll be like
And I can do without it
It's nothing
Don't wanna leave you like this
Don't wanna go about it
Just hold me if you drift
Got you worried 'bout it
And when you ask me, "what's this?"
I don't wanna talk about it
It's nothing

I'm not trying to be someone
I'm not trying to be someone
I'm not trying to be someone
I'm not
So stop trying to be someone
So stop trying to be someone
So stop trying to be someone
So stop

I'll never be a safety net
It doesn't matter what you get, go
So go on and place a bet
Won't make me a winner, babe, I know
I'll never be a safety net
It doesn't matter what you get, go
So go on and place a bet
Won't make me a winner, babe, I know

Oh, love is
It's you and me
We'll never be
Safety net, y'know

I found nothing
Yeah, I found nothing
Yeah, I'll find nothing instead
Because I'm not good looking
they're both good looking
Yeah, I find nothing instead
Instead, instead
Instead, instead, instead, instead
Instead, instead, instead, instead
Instead

I'll never be a safety net
It doesn't matter what you get, go
So go on and place a bet
I'll never be a winner, babe, I know
I'll never be a safety net
It doesn't matter what you get, go
So go on and place a bet
I'll never be a winner, babe, I know
