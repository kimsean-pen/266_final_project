Ooooooooooooooo
Come get it now
I'm tired of watching you dance
With your lazy two left feet

Throw some junk into it
If you wanna keep up with me
Come get it now
I'm still on the dance floor

I'll get you into shape
Boy you are looking like you want more
I'll push you through the break
Come get it now

Ooooooo
I'm moving to slow
Tonight we will burn

You're losing my attention
I'm letting you know

You're moving too slow
I say hey, hey
Now stop I'm gonna walk
I say hey, hey
Up your speed to getting me
Get your shit together
Let's not mock about
My glass is almost empty
And the sun is nearly down
Come get it now
Getting on the action
Gotta put your [?] long

Let's take it to the back
And we will go all night long
Ooooooo
I'm moving to slow
Tonight we will burn
You're losing my attention
I'm letting you know
You're moving too slow
Come get it now tonight
Tonight is all we got
Let's get a ticket to the morning light
Once more on the block
Come get it now tonight
Tonight is all we got
Let's get a ticket to the morning light
Once more on the block
Ooooooo
I'm moving to slow
Tonight we will burn
You're losing my attention
I'm letting you know
You're moving too slow
