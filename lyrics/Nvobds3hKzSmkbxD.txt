Conscious quiet
Fails an expectation
I don't buy it
That we don't know for sure

Cause there's a voice in the silence
A voice in the silence
There's a voice in the silence
A voice in the silence

Call out no one
It's safer when we're guessing
Hide and go on
With nothing said as loud as you like

Cause there's a voice in the silence
A voice in the silence
There's a voice in the silence
A voice in the silence
Silence

I want a conscious quiet in my soul
Silence all around me

There's a voice in the silence
There's a voice in the silence
There's a voice in the silence
There's a voice in the silence
