Another misspelled rhyme
Written in the book of time
In one page I've spent all my life
Ink ain't even dry. I've been living in a lie
How could I trust in someone of your kind?

And I got today another letter in the mail
I can't read it here, not today
And when years go by
An unopened letter meets my eye
I'm older and wiser, but still afraid

What if I read it and it is - full of love
How can I face it if I am wrong?

Do you feel? Do you care about me?
Did you wait and love me all this time?

I am here, would you come and find me
Does your writing guide me through this all?

What if you'll tell me that I am wrong?

Do you feel? Do you care about me?
Did you wait and love me all this time?
I am here, would you come and find me
Does your writing guide me through this all?
Do you feel? Do you care about me?
Wait me oh
I am here, would you come and find me oh
