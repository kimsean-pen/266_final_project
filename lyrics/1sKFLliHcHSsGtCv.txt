Just today was an accident on the street that they held hands
They were looking for their hearts, they were there from the start
Just a little too young then to understand
What it's easy to advance isn't always made to last
Here we are, caught shoveling past the ambivalent somewhere
Considered being her half and he's trying not to laugh
When they can see the rivers blur if humanity tempers with the quiet
And all the time they spent, let them chew another end again and again

At night in dreams a thousand moons and clear blue rain
Sometimes it seems as if we could build a love that will free us from pain
I know you think that it's easy to change but it's a symptom of age

Boy tread up to in white in a church made of glass
Play an imaginary part and they knew it from the start
Now here we are, barely holding on to a promise of forever
We're laying in the grass on an evening, such a task
Or maybe we're just a little too cool not to understand
Where reason finds its end, where an open heart begins
To love again

At night in dreams a thousand moons and clear blue rain
Sometimes it seems as if we could build a love that will free us from pain
I know you think that it's easy to change but it's a symptom of age

At night in dreams a thousand moons and clear blue rain
Sometimes it seems as if we could build a love that will free us from pain
I know you think that it's easy to change but it's a symptom of age

Move on, we don't have to
We can go, we understand
More life, more vision
People seeing what they can

At night in dreams a thousand moons and clear blue rain
Sometimes it seems as if we could build a love that will free us from pain
I know you think that it's easy to change but it's a symptom of age
