Here comes Christmas day
So get excited
You know we don't play
We get ignited
Dance the night away
We've been waiting all year
It's time to party, Christmas is here

Ding dong, [?]
Reindeer running through the sky
Make you feel like you can fly
Put that twinkle in your eye
Christmas Eve 'bout to get more fun, ah
Go and get dressed baby you're a stunner
March to the beat of a different drummer
House of [?] front-runner

Well I wanna hear the boom and clam
And I wanna feel the bass and snap
Got me working like a pussycat
And I wonder where my kiss is at
Holiday cheer you don't gotta work for
It's a part of you don't gotta search for
Definitely don't gotta be in church for
People out here be going berserk for

Well I know [?] is everywhere baby
We are gonna shake it tonight
And I know it's a mess out there baby
We are gonna make it alright

Here comes Christmas day
So get excited
You know we don't play
We get ignited
Dance the night away
We've been waiting all year
It's time to party, Christmas is here

It's Christmas
It's Christmas
Hey sis, it's Christmas
It's Christmas
It's Christmas
Hey sis, it's Christmas

Hark the heald angels sing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Love is all you gotta bring
Just like Martin Luther King
Grandmama said stick with the winners
She came for a snack and stayed for dinners
Breakin' it down for the saints and sinner
This kinda dam ain't [?]

Well I wanna hear the boom and clam
And I wanna feel the bass and snap
Got me working like a pussycat
And I wonder where my kiss is at
Holiday cheer you don't gotta work for
It's a part of you don't gotta search for
Definitely don't gotta be in church for
People out here be going berserk for

Well I know [?] is everywhere baby
We are gonna shake it tonight
And I know it's a mess out there baby
We are gonna make it alright

Here comes Christmas day
So get excited
You know we don't play
We get ignited
Dance the night away
We've been waiting all year
It's time to party, Christmas is here

It's Christmas
It's Christmas
Hey sis, it's Christmas
It's Christmas
It's Christmas
Hey sis, it's Christmas

Dance shirt, dancing
Giddyup [?] fixing
Giddyup [?] Cupid
Giddyup diamond blitzing
