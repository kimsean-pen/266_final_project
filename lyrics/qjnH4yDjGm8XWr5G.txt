Walked past my grave in the dark tonight
Saw the stone and the note you left for me
To answer your question
I just had to leave, I just had to leave

But that's not why I'm here
I came out here to tell you
It rains in heaven all day long
I wanna find you so bad and let you know
I'm miserable up here without you
Miserable up here with out you

Found my way back in the dark tonight
Couldn't wake up not right next to you
I'd trade in forever to just hear you say
The sound of my name

But that's not why I'm here
I came out here to tell you
It rains in heaven all day long
I wanna find you so bad and let you know
I'm miserable up here without you
Miserable up here without you

Don't believe that it's better
When you leave everything behind
Don't believe that the weather
Is perfect the day that you die
Don't believe that the weather
Is perfect the day that you die

Don't believe that the weather
Is perfect the day that you die

I came out here to tell you
It rains in heaven all day long
All day long
I wanna find you so bad and let you know
I'm miserable up here without you
Miserable up here without you

I came out here to tell you
It rains in heaven all day long
All day long
I wanna find you so bad and let you know
I'm miserable up here without you
Miserable up here without you

Don't believe that the weather
Is perfect the day that you die
