You are the one who saw that Unicorn

Puberty is not what used to be
When the gallow wasn't meant to kill
Anxiousness was old as is it

By dark - I really mean it dark

You don't know how hard is being
to be a lonely child
and navigate to feel your game
the year the game I was released
You don't need being now where I come from
my parents are divorced and
I have to spend my puberty inside shopping mall

By dark - I really mean it dark

There's a woman playing beautiful harps
And she is going a flaming flying car!

What you gonna do? Uh oh oh!
