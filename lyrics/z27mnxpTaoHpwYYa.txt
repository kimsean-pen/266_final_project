No matter how much the clock goes around
There's an aching pain
The sun goes up and the sun goes down
But it still feels the same
Your house is just some drywall now
Your parents moved away

I know you got a room with a view up there
And you're looking down on me
I know you got a room with a view up there
Please save a spot for me

It's been ten years without you
And all your friends have aged
Some got married and some had kids
And some just moved away
And theres a few that came to live with you
A few that are on the way

I know you got a room with a view up there
And you're looking down on me
I know you got a room with a view up there
Please save a spot for me

All the laughter that you missed out on
Tears in your name
Your brother and sister are doing great now
But your mother's never been the same
And your father's there to comfort them
On every happy holiday

I know you got a room with a view up there
And you're looking down on me
I know you got a room with a view up there
Please save a spot for me

I know you got a room
I know you got a room
