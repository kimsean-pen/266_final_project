Mother, I haven't been well
Search though my life and I think it's time for me
It's time, it's time to embrace this part of me
Lost can take a little while on a long journey

So come on, come on, laughin, I will be there with my brothers and then
Love is the answer to most of my questions you can't comprehend
And if I get back to the real world, I'll be back in time for you

Sister, tell me what's new
I've been going native for months since I've been missing you
Missing you grow, missing the world you hold so closely
To keep from being alone, a world we call our home

So come on, come on together sit down right here with my sister and friends
History cherishes lifetimes upon us sing if you wish
And if I get back to the real world, I'll be back in time for you
