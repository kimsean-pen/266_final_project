Come to me
To feel my protection
A countdown to my revelation
No more respect
For your regrets

And your time has come

The naked truth is in disguise
It's your secret complication
Exhausted of this sacrifice
Just like a lying preacher

Hiding to survive

So strong living in torture
I know that you will never see
The light again
the light again

So hard living in torture
Erase the burning fear into
Your eyes again
your eyes again

This silent scream is stronger now
You cannot keep it too long
This cloud evolving into rain
Your desert seems so far now

Come into my arms
fall into my arms

So strong living in torture
I know that you will never see
The light again
the light again

So hard living in torture
Erase the burning fear into
Your eyes again
your eyes again

Following your line
I'm losing mine

So strong living in torture
I know that you will never see
The light again
the light again

So hard living in torture
Erase the burning fear into
Your eyes again
your eyes again
