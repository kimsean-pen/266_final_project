This ship was only ever built to fall apart
The oceans that we couldn't cross
The London Bridge is caving in
Cities melt into my skin
It's looking thin

Where my heart is there's never a home
These wooden doors are closed and this prison's cold
In my glory bowing out to the crowd
Returning to the ground

Winter birth, the fires burn into the snow
Surrender to the afterglow
Letting mist dissolve the light
The darkness oh it burns so bright
I'm turning blind

Where my heart is there's never a home
These wooden doors are closed and this prison's all alone
In my glory bowing out to the crowd
Returning to the ground

What a moment, encountering the dawn
Breathing in the air I've never known
In my glory bowing out to the crowd
Returning to the ground
