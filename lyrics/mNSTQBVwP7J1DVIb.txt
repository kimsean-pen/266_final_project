I'm just sitting here in my treetop
I'm just swing, swing, swinging away
Feel so magical, feel so lost
Will you catch me on my way down?
I drank your cherry cola
I let you win me over
You're nicer when you're sober
Please just tell me

What makes the world go 'round?
What makes the world go 'round?
What makes the world go 'round?

Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?
Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?

You chewed my heart and spat it out
Now you're run, run, running away
You didn't pick me off the floor
You didn't catch me on my way down
My pretty mouth is open
My words just keep on flowing
I'm nicer when I'm sober
Please just tell me

What makes the world go 'round
What makes the world go 'round
What makes the world go 'round?

Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?
Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?

Is it, is it gravity?
Or is it I Love You?
Is it gravity?

I've been sitting here in my treetop
For a long time now, I'm not coming down
You see, I've been sitting here in my treetop
I'm not coming down, I'm not coming down
You see, I've been sitting here in my treetop
For a long time now, I'm not coming down
You see, I've been sitting here, I've been sitting here, I've been sitting here

Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?
Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?
Is it gravity?
Is it gravity?
