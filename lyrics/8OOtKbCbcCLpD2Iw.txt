The call to arms was never true,
Time to imbibe, here's to you,
I'll tell you stories bruised and blue,
Drum machines and landslides.

Just one more round before we're through,
More psychedelic yuppie flu,
It's such a silly thing to do,
Now we're stuck on rewind.

Let's follow the cops back home,
Follow the cops back home,
Let's follow the cops back home,
And rob their houses.

The call to arms was never true,
Let's take a ride and push it through,
Suspended animation in blue,
Blame it on apartheid,

Let's spend the night in Jimmy Choo's,
I'll give you coats and cheap shampoo,
I'll give you nothing else to do,
Now we're stuck on rewind.

Let's follow the cops back home,
Follow the cops back home,
Let's follow the cops back home,
And Rob their houses.

Let's follow the cops back home
Follow the cops back home
Let's follow the cops back home
And rob their houses.

The call to arms was never true,
I'm medicated.how are you?
Let's take a dive swim right through,
Sophisticated point of view.

Let's follow the cops back home
Follow the cops back home
Let's follow the cops back home
And Rob their houses.

Let's follow the cops back home
Follow the cops back home
Let's follow the cops back home
And rob their houses.
