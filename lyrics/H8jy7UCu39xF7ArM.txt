I know that someday you'll be sleeping, Darling, likely dreaming off the pain
I hope you'll hear me in the streetlight's humming, softly breathing out your name
I know that even with the seams stitched tightly, darling, scars will remain
I say we scrape them from each other, darling, and let them wash off in the rain
And when they run into the river, oh no, let the water not complain
I swear that even with the distance, slowly wearing out your name

Your hands still catch the light the right way and
Our hearts still beat the same
And our hearts still beat the same
