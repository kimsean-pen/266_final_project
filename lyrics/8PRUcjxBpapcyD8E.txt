Halfway gone, I'm halfway gone

You were always hard to hold
So letting go ain't easy
I'm hanging on but growing cold
While my mind is leaving
Talk, talk is cheap
Give me a word you can keep

'Cause I'm halfway gone, and I'm on my way
And I'm feelin', feelin', feelin' this way
'Cause you're halfway in, but don't take too long
'Cause I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
Halfway gone, I'm halfway gone

You got one foot out the door
And choking on the other
Always think there's something more
Is just around the corner
Talk, talk is cheap
Give me a word you can keep

'Cause I'm halfway gone, and I'm on my way
And I'm feelin', feelin', feelin' this way
'Cause you're halfway in, but don't take too long
'Cause I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
If you want me out, then I'm on my way
And I'm feelin', feelin', I'm feelin' this way

'Cause you're halfway in, but don't take too long
'Cause I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
Now I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone

Don't take too long, don't take too long
'Cause I'm on my way, if you take too long
'Cause I'm halfway gone, and I'm on way
And I'm feelin', feelin', I'm feelin' this way
'Cause you're halfway in, but don't take too long
'Cause I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
If you want me out, then I'm on my way
And I'm feelin', feelin', I'm feelin' this way

'Cause you're halfway in, but don't take too long
'Cause I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
'Cause I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
'Cause I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
