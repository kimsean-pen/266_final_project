I confuse you with my words
So you'll never figure me out
I kinda like to see you hurt
'Cause it's the only thing that makes me feel
Like I can sleep at night
Alone in my bed

I promise I will let you down
I promise I will let you down
I promise I will let you down
I promise I will let you down

'Cause I don't wanna be alone
But I don't wanna be in love
All the times I should have let you go
All the times that I should

No I can't end up all alone
But I'm too proud to be in love
So I brought you up just to carry you down

So I called you from the lowest place I've been
To tell you I was wrong and apologize for always pulling you down

Let me tell you about the lowest place I've been
About the lowest place I've been
About the lowest place I've been
