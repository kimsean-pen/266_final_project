Pale faced the innocent
Will drown in blood
Hurt and withdrawn
Don't dare to steal my grief
In this haze of green and gold
He's gone

Blind my eyes
And I still
Can see through the mist
To the very end
There I'll face
What I fear the most

Blind my eyes
But it all doesn't matter
Right now
I will bury my dead
And keep on
Til the end
I won't give up
I won't give up
I'll turn
To the red fields of none
There's a grave
There's a rose
Drift away
I can hear me say
Soon you all shall be free

Carry the blessed home
No one's left here but me
And I will sing out your name
You call me insane, I know
I've opened my heart
And my soul to you son
So pale turns the innocent
And al I feel is pain
Suddenly I understand
He's gone
Blind my eyes
And I still
Can see through the mist
To the very end
There I'll face
What I fear the most
Blind my eyes
But it all doesn't matter
Right now

But it all doesn't matter
Right now

Carry the blessed home
No one's left here but me
And I will sing out your name
Driven insane?
No
What I feared the most
I have faced and that's truth
The grey faced is not innocent
Though I cry in dismay
I will follow decay
I'll move on
Is there anyone here
Who knows
How it feels to be wrong?

Blind my eyes
And I still
Can see through the mist
To there very end
There I'll face
What I fear the most
Blind my eyes
But it all doesn't matter
Right now

But it all doesn't matter
Right now

Matter right now
Matter right now
