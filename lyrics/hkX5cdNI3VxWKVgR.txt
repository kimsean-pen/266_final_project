When I go
Into the ground
I won't go quietly
I'm bringing my crown
When I go
Into the ground
Oh, they gotta bury me
Bury me face down

From the rubble
What do I see?
There's a whole damn army, thinkin' that they're gonna harm me
Say goodnight, or i'll never get free
Oh, I got troubles
They won't let me be
But I won't get tired, set the town on fire
'Til my troubles got trouble with me
Thinkin' that they've won
It's only just begun

When I go
Into the ground
I won't go quietly
I'm bringing my crown
And when I go
Into the ground
Oh, they gotta bury me
Bury me face down
(Bury me face down)

I've been on the run
Since I was a boy
But now i'm done running
Got another thing coming
Watch my enemies get destroyed
Oh, Igot troubles
Of more than one kind
But I never sleep
Gotta bury me six feet deep, where the sun don't shine
Thinkin' that they've won
It's only just begun

When I go
Into the ground
I won't go quietly
I'm bringing my crown
And when I go
Into the ground
Oh, they gotta bury me
Bury me face down
(Bury me face down)

I've been counted out
Left for dead
Wanted with a bounty on my head
But somehow, someway
I'ma keep moving along
Moving along

Been counted out
Left for dead
Wanted with a bounty on my head
But somehow, someway
I'ma keep moving along, along
Thinking that they've won
It's only just begun

When I go
(When I go)
Into the ground
(Into the ground)
I won't go quietly
(Won't go quietly)
I'm bringing my crown
(I'm bringing my crown)

And when I go
Into the ground
(Into the ground)
Oh, they gotta bury me
(Bury me)
Bury me face down
(Bury me face down)
Oh, they gotta bury me
Bury me face down
