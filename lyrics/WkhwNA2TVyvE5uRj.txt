Viciously, she sleeps walks alone on a lonely beat
She trips, falls into it all
And I wish I bite my lip and call her away
From you, my little one, oh, from you, my little one

Don't come too close you don't wanna see my ghost
Your turn but I'm betrayed by you my sweetheart
And don't you think that you went too far?
Do you want to see my heart bleed for you, you and him
Him and you, you know my heart bleeds

All of us, we're going out tonight
We're gonna walk all over your cars
The Kooks are out in the street
Oh, we're gonna steal your skies

All of us, we're going out tonight
We're gonna walk all over your cars
The Kooks are out in the street
Oh, we're gonna steal your

I'm sorry that I let you go
I let you down, I let you down, my dear
I always seem
To play these games with you, my dear
I always, I always

All of us, we're going out tonight
We're gonna walk all over your cars
The Kooks are out in the street
Oh, we're gonna steal your skies

All of us, we're going out tonight
We're gonna walk all over your cars
The Kooks are out in the street
Oh, we're gonna steal your skies

Oh, oh, my Juliet
I'll never betray you, my love
Oh, oh, my Juliet
I'll never betray you, my love

All of us, we're going out tonight
We're gonna walk all over your cars
The Kooks are out in the street
Oh, we're gonna steal, steal your skies
All of us, we're going out tonight
We're gonna walk all over your cars
The Kooks are out in the street
Oh, we're gonna steal your skies
And don't come too close
You don't wanna see my ghost
Your turn but I'm betrayed
By you, my sweetheart
