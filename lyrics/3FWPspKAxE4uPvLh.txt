Disappear like I come in your world
Five is a number that I dream about
It looks like it could've been time
But that is a word that I dream about

Don't forget to follow your way down
Oh, I think you'd like your life when you came down
Oh, I love the lights that don't turn you to face it
Oh, you can marry my mom but you can't get the feel

Disappear like a corner in the wall
Five is a number that I dream about
Sleep looks like a mescaline sun
But calm is a word that I dream about

Don't forget to follow your way down
Oh, I think you'd like your life when you came down
Oh, I love the lights that don't turn you to face it
Oh, you can marry my mom but, but you can't get the feel

On time
(On time)
On time
(On time)
