In the dark, IÃ³in the darkness you will find
Dirty little secrets we all hide
'Cause we all have a darker side
A place we keep where no one else will find

Cuz everybody wants to hide their secrets away
Nobody wants to stand up to the pain
But I will stand up to the pain
Wake up and fight again
If you could dance with me through this rain
We will fight
We'll fight again
Fight again

In the back, in the closets of your mind
That's where skeletons and dirty secrets hide
And I'll rip out my insides
And leave them on display for you tonight

Cuz everybody wants to hide their secrets away
Nobody wants to stand up to the pain
But I will stand up to the pain
Wake up and fight again
If you could dance with me through this rain
We will fight
We'll fight again
Fight again
(Fight again)

All my life I hide my secrets away
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
We all try to hide our secrets away
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark

Stand up to the pain
Wake up and fight again
If you could dance with me through this rain
We will fight
We'll fight again
Fight again
Fight again

Cuz everybody wants to hide their secrets away, and that's okay
Nobody wants to stand up to the pain, and fight again
