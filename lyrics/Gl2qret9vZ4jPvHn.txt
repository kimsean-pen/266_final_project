I'm giving up on everything
Because you messed me up
Don't know how much
You screwed it up
You never listened
That's just too bad

Because I'm moving on
I won't forget
You were the one that was wrong
I know I need to step up and be strong
Don't patronize me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Have you forgotten everything that I wanted
Do you forget it now you never got it
Do you get it now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Gotta get away
There's no point in thinking about yesterday
It's too late now
It won't ever be the same
We're so different now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Have you forgotten everything that I wanted
Do you forget it now you never got it
Do you get it now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I know I want to run away
I know I want to run away, run away
If only I could run away
If only I could run away, run away
I told you what I wanted
I told you what I wanted, what I wanted

But I was forgotten
I won't be forgotten never again

Have you forgotten everything that I wanted
Do you forget it now you never got it
Do you get it now
Do you get it now

Have you forgotten everything that I wanted
Do you forget it now you never got it
Do you get it now
Have you forgotten
Do you get it now

Forgotten, yeah, yeah, yeah
Forgotten, yeah, yeah, yeah
Forgotten, yeah, yeah, yeah
