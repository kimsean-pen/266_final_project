There you go, you got your hooks in me,
And I'm secretly high off the feelings,
That keeps you hooked and holding on
Feel the pushed on thoughts so endlessly,
And I'm looking to find another sequence that drops me in golden door,
Golden door,
Golden door,
Oh I think about it all the time, don't know why,
Just hold me closer, so I can try expose ya,
Ooh I, think about it all the time,
Don't know why just hold me closer, so I regain composure,
Scratch our names into the Willow tree cause we're making a silent to prove that we have deep love, shown off good and loved,
I can feel your big deep breath in, breath out, breath don't stop till there's nothing left, and we want to collide for a golden door,
Oh I think about it all the time, don't know why just hold me closer, so I can try expose ya,
Ooh I, think about it all the time, don't know why just hold me closer, so I regain composure,
Golden door,
Golden door,
Oh I think about it all the time, don't know why just hold me closer, so I can try expose ya,
Ooh I, think about it all the time don't know why, just hold me closer, so I regain composure, why just hold me closer so I regain composure, why, just hold me closer so I regain composure.
