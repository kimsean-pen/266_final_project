My state of mind has finally got the best of me
I need you next to me
I'll try to find a way that I can get to you
Just wanna get to you

The world I see is perfect now
You're all around
With you I can breathe

Until you're mine, I have to find
A way to fill this hole inside
I can't survive without you here by my side

Until you're mine, not gonna be
Even close to complete
I won't rest until you're mine
Mine

Alone inside, I can only hear your voice
Ringing through the noise
I can't find my mind, keeps on coming back to you
Always back to you

Wanted something out of reach
It's killing me, you're all I see, yeah

Until you're mine, I have to find
A way to fill this hole inside
I can't survive without you here by my side

Until you're mine, not gonna be
Even close to complete
I won't rest until you're mine
Mine

Just stop wondering
If we were meant to be
Forget about faith and just hold me
I'm ready to begin
The waiting has to end
Right now, today
I've got to find a way, yeah

(Mine, until you're mine)

Until you're mine, I have to find
A way to fill this hole inside
I can't survive without you here by my side

Until you're mine, not gonna be
Even close to complete
I won't rest until you're mine

My state of mind has finally got the best of me
I need you next to me
