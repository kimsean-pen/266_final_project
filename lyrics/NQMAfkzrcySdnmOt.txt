We are on a rock, spinning silently
But I'm safe when you're here with me
These questions I'm asking, they've been haunting me
I need some security, can't you see?

Her love was like a fountain rushing and pouring down
The darkness is putting out the light in me
She's a well to be dug, she's a university
A cosmic library, wait and see

We are on a rock, spinning silently
Won't you get close to me?
We are on a rock, spinning in infinity
Won't you get close to me?

Is it my genes that have made me?
Is it the things I took?
Is it the things I said
Does karma rule?

Well, if there's a God well can you hear me now?
I am crying out, hoping you know
And in my baby's arms I need no faith
I need no words to define myself
And when I'm holding you, light rushing through
I wanna make it now, safe and straight

We are on a rock, spinning silently
Baby, get a hold of me
We are on a rock, spinning in infinity
Baby, consoling me

Oh, I don't know when the fear's going to end
I don't know if my prayers are received the ones I send

(We are on a rock, spinning silently)
I can't live in pain and fear
(We are on a rock, spinning in infinity)
Oh, I see so much joy and it makes me scared
(We are on a rock, spinning silently)
Oh, I don't know if my prayers are received, until the end
(We are on a rock, spinning in infinity)
Oh, I guess it ain't offet for you to pray for peace
Oh, baby, I don't know where I'm going
All I know is that I need you as a friend
