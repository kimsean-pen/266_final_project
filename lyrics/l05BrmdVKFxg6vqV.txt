I'm falling out of cars
Don't know when I'll hit the ground
Hold me when I fall
Headlights in my face
My body's full of scars
Words are lost and won't be found
Stay until I'm gone
Stumbling on my knees

I'm dancing in the dark
Shrinking cities feel the sound
Hear the silent hum
Searchlights in the skies
I'm blinded by the stars
There is darkness all around
Hold me when I cry
Those were all my days

I'm falling out of cars
Hanging on the windscreen
I'm blinded by the headlights
I'm killing ground
I'm dancing in the dark
Stumbling on the highway
I'm guided by the city light
I'm lost and found

I'm falling out of cars
Don't know when I'll hit the ground
Hold me when I fall
Headlights in my face
I'm dancing in the dark
Shrinking cities feel the sound
Hear the distant hum
Searchlights in my eyes

I never took the time
I should have told you then
I never found the time
Falling out of cars

I'm falling out of cars
Hanging on the windscreen
I'm blinded by the headlights
I'm killing ground
I'm dancing in the dark
Stumbling on the highway
I'm guided by the city light
I'm lost and found
