You're a riot,
But the quiet in me sometimes needed a shake
Dance in circles,
But the wild and free sometimes needed to chase
As I run I become something I always want to be
And the closer the summer is likely we ought to freeze

I'll keep myself in open fire for you
I'll do it again
In the perfect hour right away
But I'd still do,
Do it all again

Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oooh
Oh-Oh-Ooh-Ooh
Oh-Oh-Ooh
I alone
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oooh
Oh-Oh-Ooh-Ooh
Oh-Oh-Ooh

Elevated, spreading wings in me that are not gonna clip
Estimated, it's blank courage you see, I'm expecting to trip
As we fly I've decided that it's worth every risk a day
If I know what the heights, in the dorm, need to dream awake

I'll keep myself in open fire for you
I'll do it again
In the perfect hour right away
But I'd still do,
Do it all again

Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oooh
Oh-Oh-Ooh-Ooh
Oh-Oh-Ooh
I alone
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oooh
Oh-Oh-Ooh-Ooh
Oh-Oh-Ooh

I'm for everything, for every bound
We can stretch our chest, no cages for the hearts down
Through everything, through thick and thin
I had partied out

I'll keep myself in open fire for you
I'll do it again
In the perfect hour right away
But I'd still do,
Do it all again

Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oooh
Oh-Oh-Ooh-Ooh
Oh-Oh-Ooh
I alone
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oooh
Oh-Oh-Ooh-Ooh
Oh-Oh-Ooh
