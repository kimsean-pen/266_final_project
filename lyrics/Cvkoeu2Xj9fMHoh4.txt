"He'd also left a man's decapitated body lying on the floor next to his own severed head."
"A head which at this time has no name..."

- I know his name

Here I am, I'm the master of your destiny, ha haa
I am the one, the only one, I am the God of kingdom come
Gimme the prize, just gimme the prize
Give me your kings, let me squeeze them in my hands, hey hey hey
Your puny princes
Your so-called leaders of your land
I'll eat them whole before I'm done
The battle's fought and the game is won
I am the one the only one
I am the God of kingdom come
Gimme the prize, just gimme the prize
- The prize

- Ha ha ha ha ha ha
- Ha ha ha ha ha ha
- Now you die
- Ha ha ha ha ha ha
- I have something to say - it's better to burn out than to fade away
- Heeargh
- There can be only one
- Eeaaoooor

Move over, I said move over
Hey, hey, hey clear the way
There's no escape from my authority - mmm, I tell you
I am the one, the only one, I am the God of kingdom come
Gimme the prize
- The prize
Just gimme the prize
- The prize
I am the one the only one
I am the God of kingdom come
Just gimme the prize
- There can be only one -
- Heeaarghh
Hah
