Theres something in the moon tonight
Theres something about it
You're letting me go
Tear drops in the fields that arise
Illuminate!
Then bury themselves
You stood back in my room tonight
You're sleeping inside
From out in the cold
??? feelings that arize
Illuminate!
Then bury your soul

Embrace your design
With so many lights
With so many lights
Feels hard as I bite
Embrace your design
With so many lights
With so many lights
??? Torture my mind
And you still make me cry
La la la la

Breaking up again
No one thinks to mind
Bet you I could slay
But i'll get denied
We're sinking into the moon tonight
It's some kind of sign
You're letting me go
Two drops in the feelings that rise
Illuminate!
Then bury yourself

Embrace your design
With so many lights
With so many lights
Feels hard as I bite
Embrace your design
With so many lights
With so many lights
??? torture my mind
And still make me cry
La la la la

Embrace your design
With so many lights
With so many lights
Embrsce your design
With so many lights
With so many lights
