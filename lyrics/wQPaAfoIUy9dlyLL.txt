Watch me make this work, yah
Aston martin from an i8
All this money I'm worth, yah
Blowing up to almighty
I walk around in a suit now, 500 on my feet
No stairs in my new house, elevator needs a key
I'm breaking these rules now, finally found inner peace
Hublot on my wrist now, 5k for my jeans
Bands, bands, bands, bands, bands, bands, bands, bands, bands

She loves it when i call her honey, hey

I got her drunk of the bubbly, yah
I told her pull up and fuck me, hey
All about P's and bricks, aye
Ice cubes in my drink, aye
Whiskey mixed with gin, aye
Sip, sip 'til I'm sick, aye
You will become what you think, aye
All of you died with your wits, aye
You sold your soul and got shit, aye

Making money like a gambler, bad chicks getting badder now
Baby know I'm bad for her, when I fuck her, I'mma strangle her
She gone cum like an avalanche then come back like a boomerang
Crazy numbers on my advance, I want the money not romance
