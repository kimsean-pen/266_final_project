You know I gotta love you
Our name is written in the streets
You are a force of nature
The fire's moving through your feet
Ohhh your love
Your love could start a war
Your love
Is what I'm fighting for
I would die for this revelation

Ohhh your love
Your love could start a-
Your love could start a war
The dawn will break before you
Under your thumb I'm on my knees
You play a game of pressure
You're getting stronger while I sleep
You're burning up the sky you're a constellation
Swear that I could die in this revelation

Ohhh your love

Your love could start a war
Your love
Is what I'm fighting for
I would die for this revelation
Ohhh your love
Your love could start a-
Your love could start a war
Your battle cry is drowning out the fear
Just take my life
I know the end is near
You're riot dancin
But I just want to fly
I hear you singing
Tomorrow never dies
I would die for this revelation
Ohhh your love
Your love could start a war
Your love could start a war
It's what I'm fighting for
Ohhh your love
Your love could start a war
Your love is what I'm fighting for
I would die for this revelation
Ohhh your love
Is what I'm fighting for
Ohhh your love
Your love could start a war
Your love is what I'm fighting for
I would die for this revelation
Ohhh your love
Uour could start a war
