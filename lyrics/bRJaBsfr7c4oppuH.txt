And the heart is hard to translate
It has a language of its own
It talks in tongues and quiet sighs
And prayers and proclamations
In the grand days of great men and the smallest of gestures
In short, shallow gasps

But with all my education I can't seem to command it
And the words are all escaping, and coming back all damaged
And I would put them back in poetry if I only knew how
I can't seem to understand it

And I would give all this and heaven too
I would give it all if only for a moment
That I could just understand the meaning of the word you see
'Cause I've been scrawling it forever, but it never makes sense to me at all

And it talks to me on tiptoes
And it sings to me inside
It cries out in the darkest night
And breaks in the morning light

But with all my education I can't seem to command it
And the words are all escaping, and coming back all damaged
And I would put them back in poetry if I only knew how
I can't seem to understand it

And I would give all this and heaven too
I would give it all if only for a moment
That I could just understand the meaning of the word you see
'Cause I've been scrawling it forever, but it never makes sense to me at all

Oooooooooooh

And I would give all this and heaven too
I would give it all if only for a moment
That I could just understand the meaning of the word you see
'Cause I've been scrawling it forever, but it never makes sense to me at all

No words and poor language
It doesn't deserve such treatment
And all of my stumbling phrases never amounted
To anything worth this feeling

All this heaven never could describe such a feeling as I'm healing
Words were never so useful
So I was screaming out a language that I never knew existed before.
