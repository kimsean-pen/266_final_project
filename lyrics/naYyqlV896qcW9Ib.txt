Ah, is there room for both of us... both of us apart?
Are we bound out of obligation? Is that all we've got?
I get the words, and then I get to thinkin'

I don't wanna think, I wanna feel
How do I feel?
How do I?

If you're the only one, will I never be enough, yeah
Hail, Hail the lucky ones... I refer to those in love, yeah
Oh, how I'd love ya till the day I die... and beyond
Are we goin' to the same place?
If so, can I come?

It's egg rollin', thick and heavy
All the past we carry
Oh, I could be new
You underestimate me
If you're the only one will I never be enough, yeah
Hail, Hail the lucky ones... I refer to those in love, yeah
I sometimes realize... I could only be as good as you'll let me
Are you woman enough to be my man?
Bandaged hand in hand
I find it on my run in a race that can't be won, yeah
All Hail the lucky ones... I refer to those in love, yeah
If you're my only one
So good, you only one
I want to be your one
Enough, you won, your one, your one
