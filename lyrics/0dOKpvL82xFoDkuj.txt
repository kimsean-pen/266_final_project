Yeah
Ooh yeah
Wait a minute before you walk away
Let me finish, I've got a lot to say, yeah
Baby, I'm not gonna tolerate this game that you play, no
You'll regret it if you desert me this way, yeah
When there's nobody to dry your eyes
Suddenly you're gonna realize
Don't you know you need me
Don't you see, believe me
Before you act so hastily
Baby, remember you need me
Honey, listen, don't make a big mistake, no
I'm in your system, you really can't escape, no, no
When there's nobody to hold your hand
Suddenly you're gonna understand
Don't you know you need me
Don't you see, believe me
Before you act so hastily
Then baby, remember you need me
Don't you know you need me
Don't you see, gotta believe me
Before you act so hastily
Baby, remember you need me
No one understands you like I do
After everything that we've been through
Baby, you can turn around and leave
But I know that you'll keep coming right back to me
Get down here
You know
Ooh
Don't you know you need me
Don't you see, gotta believe me
Now before you act so hastily
Baby, remember you need me
Don't you know you need me
Don't you see, believe me
Baby, now before you act so hastily
Baby, remember you need me
Don't you know you need me
Don't you see, believe me
Well, baby, remember you need me
Don't you know you need me
Don't you see, believe me
