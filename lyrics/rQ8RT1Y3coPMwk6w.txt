Sick of drugs and dancing feet
Sick of bars where people meet
Smell of crotch and sheets not clean
Hairy men in magazines
Every city looks the same
Running from the threat of rain
Pillow talk that's just for one
Saturday get nothing done

Lie to me
It takes less time
To drink you pretty

Lie to me
It takes less time
To drink you pretty

Human seas of apathy
Nuclear catastrophe
Jumbos crash into the ground
Governments sleep safe and sound
Mornings glisten cold and bright
Organs stolen every night
Can of beans and fast boquet
Double jackpot give away

Lie to me
It takes less time
To drink you pretty

Lie to me
It takes less time
To drink you pretty

Hello pretty
Hello
Hello pretty
Hello
Hello pretty
Hello
Hello pretty

Lie to me
It takes less time
To drink you pretty

Lie to me
It takes less time
To drink you pretty
