You did me wrong, and I applauded you
I became the blade, and I pierced through
Now hiding from the world outside
Trying to create magic for the pacified

You never felt the answers
Were aimed at you, my friend
Did you find yourself lost
In the world we swore to protect?

If you could see it, if you could see it through my eyes
Why are we so different?
Want you to feel it, want you to know what it was like
Then maybe you'll understand

You always did prefer to keep me on distance
So no wonder it served for your riddance

You never felt the answers
Were aimed at you, my friend
Did you find yourself lost
In the world we swore to protect?

If you could see it, if you could see it through my eyes
Why are we so different?
Want you to feel it, want you to know what it was like
Then maybe you'll understand

If you can see it through my eyes
If you can see it through my eyes

You never felt the answers
Were aimed at you, my friend
Did you find yourself lost
In the world we swore to protect?

If you could see it, if you could see it through my eyes
Why are we so different?
Want you to feel it, want you to know what it was like
Then maybe you'll understand
If you could see it, if you could see it through my eyes
Why are we so different?
Want you to feel it, want you to know what it was like
Then maybe you'll understand
