I'm swimming for the shore
To flee the future of my world
It's a bloody moon, it's a dirty earth
We found our way to the end of youth
It's a whispered voice now piercing through
It's a brighter wound
It's a brighter wound
It's a brighter wound

I'm not ready for today
I'm still caught in yesterday's wake
It's plain to believe but it's hard to see
From within the shadow comes a light
Through the hole in your aching side
It's a brighter wound
It's a brighter wound
Oh, it's a brighter wound
