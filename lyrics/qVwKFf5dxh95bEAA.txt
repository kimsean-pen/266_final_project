The lonely won't hold me for good
Peaceful is gleaming she stood
To see her, to be her, to change
As if like a kiss we're the same
So hold me up, hold me up
If only I could be you

My sister, my pistol below
If you could know all that I know
I'm falling, no warning, no way
Tomorrow, tomorrow's too late
So hold me up, hold me up
I know that I could be you

So priceless and godless I wait
To leave this soul behind
Untangle the jangle of bells
They ring my fear through the night

Lalalala...
