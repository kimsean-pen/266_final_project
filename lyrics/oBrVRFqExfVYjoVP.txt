Oh, I leave my lantern on
To find home soon I hope
It's been far too long
With this heavy hail

I need a place to rest
Oh, I meet another test

Oh, sink or swim
Find fires to kindle them
Got my throat to win
And robbing me

I fight 'til death for getting me
I face that death to keep my head
All the moons a howlin' whoa
My constitution's ready

I wait 'til what comes through
I fought a strider and a carrier
It's been far too long
Another death

I meet a cut off trail
Oh, I meet nightly hail

Unleashed at dusk
Hunted and running 'til the sun comes up
Through the thick and thin
Unaware if it's come

I fight 'til death for getting me
I face at death to keep my head
All the moons a howlin' whoa
My constitution's ready
Oh
Oh

Damned if Iay down
Close my eyes for I
May not find a way out
Or find my way home

I leave my lantern on
It's been far too long
With this heavy hail

I fight 'til death for getting me
I face that death to keep my head
All the moons a howlin' whoa
My constitution's ready

I fight 'til death for getting me
I face that death to keep my head
All the moons a howlin' whoa
My constitution's ready

Damned if Iay down
Close my eyes for I
May not find a way out
Or find my way home
