Can I walk alone?
Can I stick a toe in it so I think it's fine
How far should I go?
Will it be enough to feel it slipping through my mind?
It's time I check the plan,
Can I meet you, understand?
Take my hand, don't let her teach you
Of the feeling, you deserve anything

Can I go again?
Feeling really tired right after something that you said
Slap me hard instead
Seems like the best way to free the covers on my head
Time I check the plan
Can I meet you, understand?
Take my hand, don't let her teach you
Of the feeling, you deserve anything

I got lots to tell you, please don't let me go
Just to say I was wrong
I got so much face it and I will waste it now
Put me where I belong
I got lots to tell you, where'd you get to run
Need a friend to be strong
I got over you and, you keep me it's at least

Can you help me along with things

Can I walk alone?
Can I take a seat or it's just too much to know
How much should I show
Will it be enough to feel it
'Till it's time to go
Time I check the plan
Can I meet you, understand?
Take my hand, don't let her teach you
Of the feeling, you deserve it again
Tell me where to go, should I meet you
I don't know
I can't stand, to make an issue, of a feeling
When we know we shouldn't do
I got lots to tell you, please don't let me hear
Just to seem I was wrong
I got so much face it, I will waste it now
Take me where I belong
I don't know where I went see you upset
Please, can't you sing me a song?
I'm exploding here, can you get me, it's at least
Can you have me along
I'm old, I'm old, I'm old,
I'm old, I'm old, I'm old.
