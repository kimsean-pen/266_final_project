It seems we have lost
Lay down your arrows
They won't cause flaming hearts
It seems we have lost
We keep on running in different directions

Never again
The way you're turning all my wrongs to right
Never again
This one you can't deny
Never again
I wanted to reveal a softer side
Never again
Forgive me if I tried to do what's right

I was only holding on
To everything we've had so far
I thought I was ready to let go
But I'm not
I was only holding on
To everything we've had so far
I thought I was ready but
Now it seems, yes now it seems

It seems we have lost
Lay down your arrows
They won't cause flaming hearts
It seems we have lost
Forget about your pride
Forget everything, everything you're taught

The way you're turning all my wrongs to right
Never again
This one you can't deny
Never again
I wanted to reveal a softer side
Never again
Forgive me if I tried to do what's right

I was only holding on
To everything we've had so far
I thought I was ready but
Now it seems, yes now it seems
