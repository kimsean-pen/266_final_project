Poet i'm sick of your pretty lies.
And it was about the song that sang of the shelves i wished you on.
Now sing along.
And i used to wish my heart as good my heart as strong.
And i used to wish i.
Don't say it's gone.
I'll pull the truth to you.
And even if it breaks us both down.
Don't say it's gone

The Time It Took
