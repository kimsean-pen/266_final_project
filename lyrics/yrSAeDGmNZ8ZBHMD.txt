Sitting up on the roof
Sneaking a smoke by the chimney
Checking out the moon
And the city lights
He takes off his flannel shirt
And he drapes it around her shoulders
Slides up behind her and holds on tight
And she says
"I don't want this night to end
Why does it have to end?"

Tomorrow she'll be rolling down I-10
Baton Rouge, LSU
18 years in her rearview
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block
At daddy's shop
It ain't much, but it's a job
They've been dreading this moment all summer long
The night before life goes on

Ooh
A tear falls off her cheek and
Right when it hits his arm, he says
"Come on baby, let's get out of here"
They take one last drive around town
And man, it already looks different
He bangs the wheel and says "life ain't fair"
And this growing up stuff man, I don't know
I just don't wanna let you go"

Tomorrow she'll be rolling down I-10
Baton Rouge, LSU
18 years in her rearview
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block
At daddy's shop
It ain't much, but it's a job
They've been dreading this moment all summer long
The night before life goes on

Yeah, that's what my momma told me
And just like those kids
I didn't wanna listen to no one
Yeah, there's nothing you can do
There's nothing you can say
And I know how it feels when love goes away

Tomorrow she'll be rolling down I-10
Baton Rouge LSU
18 years in her rearview
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block
At daddy's shop
It is not much, but it's a job
They've been dreading this moment all summer long
But here it is, they don't have long
The night before life goes on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
