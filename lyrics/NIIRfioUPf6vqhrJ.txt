Do you know, how they say
How they say, in the movies
Once you stop searching, love will come your way
Never again will I let someone in I said,
I might've just jumped the gun.

Dancing alone,
Might've been fun, before you came to realize
The lights went out,
But silhouette appeared, in my sight

You took my heart,
You're my salvation
You're lift me up,
You're my salvation, you're my salvation

I do recall, I never thought
Anything could ever change
So easy giving up on hope, with all the love in you
Just waiting to be found,
I might've just jumped the gun

Walking alone,
Might've been cool, before you came to realize
The lights went out,
But silhouette appeared, in my sight

You took my heart,
You're my salvation
You're lift me up,
You're my salvation, you're my salvation

Dancing da da dancing
Da dance dance da da da
Dancing da da dancing
Da dance dance da da da
Da da daaaa
Dancing

You took my heart,
You're my salvation
You're lift me up,
You're my salvation, you're my salvation

Dancing alone,
Might've been fun, before you c-c-came to realize
The lights went out,
But silhouette appeared, in my sight

You're my salvation.
