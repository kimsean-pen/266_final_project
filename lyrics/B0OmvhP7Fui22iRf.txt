Runnin' through my weed like, yeah
Runnin' through my weed like, yeah
Runnin' through my weed like, yeah
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well

One, two, been thinking long and hard this morning
Three, four, it's hard to focus when a nigga's on it
I been tryna balance all this on my plate
I ain't tryna be lying to your face
You can do better than that
Something I need to share before you rest here
I know that you gave your best here
But I can't figure out what's next here

I pray to God I don't have to pay for not knowing
This world is new to me, I do not know it
My pride never wanted you to know this
Sometimes I just wanna be alone and

Either way I gotta go, woah, oh
When it comes to cutting ties, girl, I'm like a pro, woah, woah
I tell you what you wanna know, oh, woah
You're prolly better on your own, oh, no

Girl, you know I'm moving through that thang at the speed of light
Rolling on the street like this gon' be what you want it to be like
All night, you been on my brain right, going to the pain right
Girl, we know that nothing is the same, right

Five, six, times that I shoulda had that convo, yeah
Seven, eight, could you be gone by tomorrow?
Hydroplaning and I'm tryna pop my brakes
I don't wanna make it look like I ran away
You could do better than I
Something you need to know, you gotta let go
You throwing a fit and that's old
Don't be stepping on my Prestos

I pray to God I don't have to pay for not knowing
This world is new to me, I do not know it
My pride never wanted you to know this
Sometimes I wanna be alone and

Either way I gotta go, woah, oh, yeah
When it comes to cutting ties, girl, I'm like a pro, woah, woah
I tell you what you wanna know, oh, woah
You're prolly better on your own, oh, no
Either way I gotta go, woah, oh
When it comes to cutting ties, girl, I'm like a pro, woah, woah
I tell you what you wanna know, oh, woah
You're prolly better on your own, oh, no

One, two, been thinking long and hard this morning
Three, four, it's hard to focus when a nigga's on it
Five, six, times that I shoulda had that convo, yeah
