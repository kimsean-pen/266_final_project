Some say my lover is a pale green light
He hovers high where the moon shines bright
I feel him come to me in the dead of night
And I go to the other side
And when he lovingly takes my hand
Pulls me close to a windswept land
I can't make anybody else understand
How I go to the other side

You know that I'll love you till the stars don't shine
You know that you'll always fill this heart of mine
And I could never forget with time
All our close encounters
All our close encounters

And on the other side, he's all around
He is a starry beam that lays me down
And we become a dream of time and sound
When I go to the other side

You know that I'll love you till the stars don't shine
You know that you'll always fill this heart of mine
And I could never forget with time
All our close encounters
All our close encounters
All our close encounters
