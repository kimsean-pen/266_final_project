You wake up to the screaming darkness
You brave the murk that moves
Like a bat in the night
Or an afllatus divine?

You're one of those terminal illusions
They're looking through you
They don't care what's inside
If you laugh while you die

You're spinning your cocoon
Now is it really you
Or is the expectation that surrounds you?
Choking!

Lonely and invisible we run

Fade away!
Walls they gave in on you
I'm the ground that's gonna open

Light of day
Drove you out to the gloom
I'm the Ravenblack that's there for you

Determination called your name
You feel like a template screened
Onto a wall of concrete by a social elite
You dwell on thoughts of being elsewhere

Receive the blessings of those
Roads in the night there's no place
In the light for those castles in the sky
You sit and wonder why

The Ashen hand of reason
Wraps its cloak around your dream
Admonitory fingers

You fade away!
Walls they gave in on you
I'm the ground that's gonna open

Light of day
Drove you out to the gloom
I'm the Ravenblack that's there for you

They say you've got to want it
On the treadmill
You gotta want it badly
You're predestined to be
What they're eyes wanna see

A terminated fire!

Fade away!
Walls they gave in on you
I'm the ground that's gonna open

Light of day
Drove you out to the gloom
I'm the Ravenblack that's there for you
