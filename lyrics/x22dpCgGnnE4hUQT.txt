She said "let's put a plastic bag over our heads,
And then kiss and stuff till we get dizzy and fall on the bed."
We were in heaven for five or six minutes, then we passed out,
And I was so in love I thought I knew what love was all about

In church on Sunday making out in front of the preacher.
You had a black shirt on with a big picture of Nietzsche.
When we had done our thing for a full christian hour,
I had made up my mind that there must be a higher power.

A higher, higher power.
A higher, higher power.

At your Christmas-party, I hold your hair when you vomit,
I help you up to brush your teeth, and then I kiss your stomach.
We lie still on your bed, the room is lit only by the tele
And it's a perfect night for feeling melancholy.

A higher, higher power.
A higher, higher power.

Higher, higher power.
Higher, a higher power.

A higher, higher power.
A higher, higher power.
