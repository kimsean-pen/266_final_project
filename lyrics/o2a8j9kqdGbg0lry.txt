Well i don't know what'll come of this
And yeah i don't know if it'll change
But i do know that i care for you
And i'm the one to blame

Sitting here on my bed alone
Wishing you were here
Maybe someday this would be the case
I'd wait a thousand years

[bridge]
Don't walk away
I want you to stay
Just stay for a while
I love it when you

[chorus]
Smile!
Cuz i have fallen for you everytime, be mine
And when i see your face i freeze
Cuz you're the other half of me, my girl
I love it when you smile

I write this song for the girl i love
So beautiful and kind
I hope someday that she'll fall for me
So her problems will be mine

Our time together is just winding down
I hope that i don't cry
To see you walk away from me
Makes me want to die

[bridge]
Don't walk away
I want you to stay
Just stay for a while
I love it when you

[chorus]
Smile!
Cuz i have fallen for you everytime, be mine
And when i see your face i freeze
Cuz you're the other half of me, my girl
I love it when you smile
I love it when you smile

Our lives may go in separate ways
Many miles they'll be apart
But when you smile you're like an angel
You'll always be in my heart

[bridge]
Don't walk away
I want you to stay
Just stay for a while
I love it when you

[chorus]
Smile!
Cuz i have fallen for you everytime, be mine
And when i see your face i freeze
Cuz you're the other half of me, my girl
I love it when you smile
I love it when you smile
