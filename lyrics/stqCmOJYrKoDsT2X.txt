One man speaking the truth
No one likes when it fits
So we tell soothing lies
And betray our own lips

The uncivilized world
And its people decay
Once sweet breeze is defiled
Sucking our breath away

Yesterday's answers has nothing to do
With today's questions

Life can only be understood in reverse
But must be lived forwards...
I'm losing my senses
I'm losing my senses

We watch as the living all die
Contemplating if we should
Ever open our eyes

If all that we touch
Keeps turning to sand
We will cease to exist
Till the last living man

Yesterday's answers has nothing to do
With today's questions

Life can only be understood in reverse
But must be lived forwards...
Life can only be understood in reverse
But must be lived forwards...
I'm losing my senses

Yesterday's answers has nothing to do
With today's questions

Life can only be understood in reverse
But must be lived forwards...
Life can only be understood in reverse
But must be lived forwards...
