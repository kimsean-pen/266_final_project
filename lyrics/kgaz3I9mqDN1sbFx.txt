When truth gets left untouched it accumulates like dust
When truth gets left untouched
When truth gets left untouched

I woke in a fluster
I saw my walls disintegrates, before my very eyes
Now that was a surprise
I looked out my window
I saw houses fracture and dissolve
Straight into thin air
That gave me a scare!

It's the revolt of the atoms
From London Town to Ancient Athens
Eliminate all traces of human life
They plan to wipe us out

It's the revolt of the atoms
From London Town to Ancient Athens
Eliminate all traces of human life
They plan to wipe us out

I found some Intel
The atoms had conveyed, convened and connived
To the sound of my alarm clock
Now that was a shock
Helium spoke first
It cooled tempers and lifted spirits
But then it made a threat
And that made me sweat!

It's the revolt of the atoms
From London Town to Ancient Athens
Eliminate all traces of human life
They plan to wipe us out

It's the revolt of the atoms
From London Town to Ancient Athens
Eliminate all traces of human life
They plan to wipe us out

They plan to wipe us out
They plan to wipe us out

When truth gets left untouched it accumulates like dust
When truth gets left untouched it accumulates like dust
When truth gets left untouched it accumulates like dust
When truth gets left untouched it accumulates like dust
When truth gets left untouched it accumulates like dust
When truth gets left untouched it accumulates like dust

Everything is crumbling
