I see the smell now I'm ready for hell
If this is the end, well I guess it's the end
Because my California dream it came true
I see the smell now I'm ready for hell
If this is the end, well I guess it's the end
Because my California dream it came true
It came true
It came true
It came true
It came true
I see the smell now I'm ready for hell
If this is the end, well I guess it's the end
Because my California dream it came true
I see the smell now I'm ready for hell
If this is the end, well I guess it's the end
Because my California dream it came true
I see the smell now I'm ready for hell
If this is the end, well I guess it's the end
Because my California dream it came true
I see the smell now I'm ready for hell
If this is the end, well I guess it's the end
Because my California dream it came true
It came true
It came true
It came true
It came true
