Go out and tell the society
The talk of the town is on its way
This is not bad only serious
Do understand, don't turn your back on me
Doesn't matter heads or tails
People know my sins, I'm overwhelmed
It's the darkest night in a long long time I¹ve been up all night and walked up and down the stairs
No complaints, no echoes, I'm trying to be good, ain't trying to behave well

Sometimes in the fall, fall, fall, fall
There'll be nothing to keep you far from me
Before I am long long long gone
There'll be nothing to keep me away

Every night at seven o'clock
Every day at six in the morning too
People calling me up here
Didn't even take some time to look at them
I'm long long long long long long long long long long long long long l-l-l-long gone
If you're walking around then I'll go out too
You¹ve been awake all night I¹ve been lying on you thinking the same
Lonely and forsaken
Would you mind just to try a little less?

Sometimes in the fall, fall, fall, fall
There'll be nothing to keep you far from me
Before I am long long long gone
There'll be nothing to keep me away

And it goes on and on and on, it's everlasting
It's always the same when you're next to me
Sometimes in the fall, fall, fall, fall
There'll be nothing to keep me away

Long long long long long long long long long long long long lo-lo-lo-long gone
Many eyes to see for me
Only yours to cry on my ashes
Long long long long long long long long l-l-l-l-l-long gone
It's the darkest night and I'm far from you
You¹ve been awake all night, he's a Nobel Prize, I said
Many eyes to see for me
Only yours to cry on my ashes
Long long long long long long long long long long long long l-l-l-long gone
If the countdown on the Eiffel Tower could show less than ten but more than a hundred Tired to look at your photographs
That night through the phone you¹ve been asking for more

Sometimes in the fall, fall, fall, fall
There'll be nothing to keep you far from me
Before I am long long long gone
There'll be nothing to keep me away
And it goes on and on and on, it's everlasting
It's always the same when you're next to me
Sometimes in the fall, fall, fall, fall
There'll be nothing to keep me away
