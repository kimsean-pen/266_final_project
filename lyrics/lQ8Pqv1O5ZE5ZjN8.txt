Can you remember when you were just 6 years old?
With a trusting believing everything you're told?
Anyone bigger must have been right
Even if they were wrong
You'd take what was given
You didn't know better

All your little mind could comprehend was goodness and truth
Even when the baddest things were being done to you
Ain't it a shame how you paid for your innocence
When you take what is given
You didn't know better 'bout...

Loving, cheating, people leaving
Dying, living, losing and forgiving
Growing, saying, knowing
Being who you are

What about the time when you became 16 years old?
With an unsure heart believing some of what you're told?
Wanting to be someone different
But there's pressure to be the same
Still you'd take what was given
You didn't know better

All that you could think was what you should or should not do
Every single insecurity was magnified for you
And suddenly you begin to feel
All the contradictions
But you take what was given
You didn't know better 'bout

Loving, cheating, people leaving
Dying, living, losing and forgiving
Growing, saying, knowing
Being who you are

Now here you are a little older than before
You've really been through it and you might go through some more
But if there is one precious thing you learn
It's that you can't just take what is given
'Cause now you know better
