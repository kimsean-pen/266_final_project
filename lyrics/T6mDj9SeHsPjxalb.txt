Some mistakes
Are harder to recover from
And I miss the days
I could take my make up and put a brave face on
Oh, my beautiful summer
How the winter makes me wonder
Where you've gone
Oh, my beautiful summer
How the winter makes me wonder
Where you've gone

Every night when the sun goes down,
And I'm left in this lonely town,
I hear you calling me, hear you calling me
Eeeeh-yeah
Everytime that I say goodbye,
Every night when I close my eyes,
I hear you calling me, hear you calling me
Eeeehh

(...)

Memories lie
There's no such thing as a perfect life
Oh, and I let it die
But, looking back I can't remember why
Oh, my beautiful summer
How the winter makes me wonder
Where you've gone
Oh, my beautiful lover
We were perfect for each other
I was wrong

Every night when the suckle start,
And I'm left in this lonely town,
I hear you calling me, hear you calling me
Eeeeh-yeah
Everytime that I say goodbye,
Every night when I close my eyes,
I hear you calling me, hear you calling me
Eeeeh-yeah

(...)

Take me home, take me home,
I don't know this place
Are you there watching if I'm lying awake?
Thinking of you
Take me home, take me home,
I don't know this place
Are you there watching if I'm lying awake?
Thinking of you

Oh, my beautiful summer
How the winter makes me wonder
Where you've gone

Every night when the suckle start,
And I'm left in this lonely town,
I hear you calling me, hear you calling me
Eeeeh-yeah
Everytime that I say goodbye,
Every night when I close my eyes,
I hear you calling me, hear you calling me
I hear you calling
I hear you calling
Me, me
