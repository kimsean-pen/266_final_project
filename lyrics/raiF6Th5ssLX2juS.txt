I get a little bit dizzy
I jump through hoops and climb trees
Cover my toxic loving
All in the saddling fear, oh

That you; see me, see me
See me, see me

Why would I ever hurt him?
I care about the way you see me
I wanna wake you from this
I'll fight you without the fear, oh
If you'll just... see me, see me
See me, see me, see me

You never look at your surroundings
You only think I need my exchange
But I wait by the change
And I grow on no one touches
And I unravel your mistakes

If you'd just go see me, see me
I get a little bit dizzy
I jump through hoops and climb trees
Cover my toxic loving
All in the saddling fear, oh

That you see me, see me
See me, see me

You never look at your surroundings
You only think I need my exchange
But I wait by the change
And I grow on no one touches
And I unravel your mistakes
But I wait by the change
And I grow on no one touches
And I unravel your mistakes
