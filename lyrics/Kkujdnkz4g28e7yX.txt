You call this a survival
I said I'll survive
You said it's nothing quiet,
It never is, it never was
It never changes

Two hearts in motion
Two hearts in motion
Hard to be, at the same time

It changes like the season
I said I'll survive
You said it's not a reason
It never is, it never was
It never changes

Two hearts in motion
Two hearts in motion
Hard to be, at the same time
I know it's hard to comprehend
I know it's easy to pretend
Hard to turn around,
There is too much time to pass away
Hard to turn around,
There is too much time to pass away
And time to fade away, no

Two hearts in motion
Two hearts in motion
Hard to be, at the same time
