ON THE RUN - POSTILJONEN

In the night our lights go on
Hold my hand as we shine through town
If you knew me, you would know that
I'm always higher when you're around

Oh, we're always on the run
Boy, we'll shine until we're gone

Lay us down in the grass, alone
Let the sky fall in our arms
Might be dreaming and if i'm dreaming
Let me sleep forever more

Oh, we're always on the run
Boy, we'll shine until we're gone

In your dream, oh 2x

Let me in...

We were the ones who, we were the ones who were (here)
