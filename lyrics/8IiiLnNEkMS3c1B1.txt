It's like a diamond ring, it's a precious thing
And we never want to lose it
It's like a favorite song that we love to sing
Every time we hear the music

And we're in this love together
We got the kind that lasts forever
We're in this love together
And like berries on the vine, it gets sweeter all the time

It's like a rainy night in candlelight
And, ooh it's so romantic
We got the whole thing working out so right, yes
And it's just the way we planned it

We're in this love together
We got the kind that lasts forever
Don't you know that we're in this love together
And like berries on the vine, it gets sweeter all the time

Don't you know, we're in this love together
We got the kind that lasts forever
We're in this love together
We got a kind that will last forever and evermore

Don't you know, we're in this love together
We got the kind that lasts forever
Tell you that we're in this love together
Why don't you find love that has broken up the law

Don't you know, that we're in this love together
We got the kind that brings to mind a favorite song
Girl they say that, we're in this love together
We got the kind that lingers all night long, hey hey

We're in this love together
