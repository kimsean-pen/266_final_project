That girl is giving you the eye
And I and I and I don't like it how she makes you laugh so much,
how when you're talking, that you touch,
She's instantly more pretty and more interesting than me,
She is thinking before she speaks,
She is not all rendered and gree,
I bet she doesn't like to eat,
I bet her feet don't even stink!
I know your eyes are just for me but

Kiss that Grrrl and I will shrink up
And I will die and I will think up
1, 000 ways that I can hurt you and
You will never touch my hand!
Kiss that Grrrl and I will shrink up
And I will die and I will think up
1, 000 ways that I can hurt you and
You will never touch my hand!

Tonnight we have not got on well,
I know I have given you hell,
I wish we should have stayed at home
Cause now I'm standing on my own
And you are having a nice time
With a girl I really don't like
I know your eyes are just for my but

Kiss that Grrrl and I will shrink up
And I will die and I will think up
1, 000 ways that I can hurt you and
You will never touch my hand!
Kiss that Grrrl and I will shrink up
And I will die and I will think up
1, 000 ways that I can hurt you and
You will never touch my hand!

Baby please don't break my heart
Cause you are the only one I love
I'll be by your side till the very end
Cause you're my only friend!

Kiss that Grrrl and I will shrink up
And I will die and I will think up
1, 000 ways that I can hurt you and
You will never touch my hand!

Kiss that Grrrl and I will shrink up
And I will die and I will think up
1, 000 ways that I can hurt you and
You will never touch my hand!
