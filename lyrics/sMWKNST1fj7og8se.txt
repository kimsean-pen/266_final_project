Can you explain
This subtle change
That dull, sweet ache
That takes my mind
To a place where nothing can see
Dissatisfied, as you drift back to what you were
Before, before you came here
I'm losing some pieces, here at the end
And I can't find exactly where I came in

Drifting backwards into nothing

Oh, my god it's watching me and moving in me
I feel its sickness in me
I see sickened entropic vision
Death above me, and rot below
I feel the change

Can you explain
This subtle change
That dull, sweet ache
That takes my mind
To a place that I can't remember

What could it be
This all-enveloping white
It wants to decompose me
They want this living husk

Eyes move in silence
Through a blanket of night
The air here is stagnant
This wood void of light

Not for the eyes of silence
Withered in this wicked copse
They only seek to change me
From man to fetid rot

Speaking to me, the only voice I hear
Caresses me with its cold and static logic
Moving backwards through a forest of transition
I'm drifting backwards into nothing

Can you explain (I don't think they can hear me)
This subtle change (Is the forest screaming?)
Can you explain (Stark dissatisfaction)
I can't remember why I came here
