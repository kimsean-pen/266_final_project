There was a time
Looking through myself
Wanting to pretend
If I escaped I could fill myself
I don't think you can
Been far and wide
But that hole inside
Never really leaves
I went away
But I really left
Left behind was me

It's telling me

To be on my way
Hooooooooooome
Ohh oh oh, ohh oh oh
A Million Miles Away
(Ohh oh oh, ohh oh oh)
A Million Miles Away
I can't say
"I can stay"
(Ohh oh oh, ohh oh oh)

A Million Miles Away
Each passing day
Every passing face
Seems like such a blur
I long to be
Home silently
Lying next to her
Just to get back
By her side is all,
All I need to be
I went away

What I really left
Left behind was me

I need to be
Getting on my way
Hooooooooooome
Ohhhh oh oh oh
A Million Miles Away
(Oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
A Million Miles Away
I can't take
I can't take

(Oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
A Million Miles Away

It's telling me
To be on my way
Hooooooooooome
I can't take, I can't take
A Million Miles Away
I can't take, I can't take
A Million Miles Away
I can't take, I can't take
A Million Miles Away
I can't take, I can't take
A Million Miles Away
I cant take I cant take
A Million Miles Away
I cant take I cant take
A Million Miles Away
I cant take I cant take
A Million Miles Away
I cant take I cant take
A Million Miles Away
