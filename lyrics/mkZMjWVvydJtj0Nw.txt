This is for them twenty-somethin's
Time really moves fast you were just sixteen
This is for them thirty-somethin's
That didn't turn out exactly how your mom and dad wanted you to be
This is for them forty-somethin's
Well raise up your glass and laugh like a mutha...
This is for them fifty-somethin's
Hell you're halfway there baby take it to the head

Mom and dad tried to hide the world
Said the world's just too big for a little girl
Eyes wide open, can't you see
I had my first heels by the age of thirteen

Mom and dad tried to hide the boys
I swear that just made 'em want me more
At fourteen they asked me what i want to be
I said baby twenty-one, so I get me a drink

I'm not a teacher, babe but, I can teach you something
I'm not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I'm great at writing physical love letters

I'm a freak all day, a-a-all night (oh)
Hot top flight, boy you're outta sight
And I'm crazy all day, a-a-all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life

(Oh oh, oh oh, oh-oh ohh ohh)
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh-oh ohh ohh) Schoolin' life
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh-oh ohh ohh)
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh-oh ohh ohh) Schoolin' life

This is for them pretty-somethin's
Livin in the fast lane, see you when you crash babe
This is for them sexy-somethin's
That body ain't gon' always get you out of everything
This is for them bitter-somethin's
Stop livin' in regret, baby it's not over yet
This is for them chipper-somethin's
That's high on life, baby put me on your flight

I'm not a teacher, babe but, I can teach you something
I'm not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I'm great at writing physical love letters

I'm a freak all day, a-a-all night (oh)
Hot top flight, boy you're outta sight
And I'm crazy all day, a-a-all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life

(Oh oh, oh oh, oh-oh ohh ohh)
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh-oh ohh ohh) Schoolin' life
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh-oh ohh ohh)
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh-oh ohh ohh) Schoolin' life

You know it cost to be the boss, one day you'll run the town
For not makin' life that you decide
Baby party till the fire marshall shut this sucka down

I'm not a teacher, babe but, I can teach you something
I'm not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I'm great at writing physical love letters

I'm a freak all day, a-a-all night (oh)
Hot top flight, boy you're outta sight
And I'm crazy all day, a-a-all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life

(Oh oh, oh oh, oh-oh ohh ohh)
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life (oh oh, oh oh, oh-oh ohh ohh)
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh-oh ohh ohh)
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life (oh oh, oh oh, oh-oh ohh ohh)

There's not a real way to live this... for real
Just remember to stay relentless... oh yeah, oh yeah
Don't stop running until it's finished... yeah yeah yeah
It's up to you the rest is unwritten... yeah, yeah, yeah
