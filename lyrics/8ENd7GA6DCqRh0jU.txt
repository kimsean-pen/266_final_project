You used to dealing with basic bitches
Basic shit, all the time
I'm a new classic, upgrade your status
From a standby, to a frequent flyer
Hop out your past life
And I'll renovate your future
Then I integrate my genius shit
We purchasin', not perusing
Yeah, I love your hustle baby
Just let me add a little bit of muscle baby
Joint venture, we'll partner up
Until the shares errupt, and I up your wages
On a private island, DOLO
Where 1 meal costs a car note
Them broads before me was local
Through customs, accustom your wardrobe then

Stamp passports, and we yatch past ports
Till the clocks fast forward
Till we dock blue shores
Where they don't do chores
We just get chauffeured
Damn, this is the life
Exclusive shit with all access granted
In the country where the accents are grand
And they landin' on top of foreign mansions

I'mma change your life, I'mma change it
I'mma change your life (life)
I'mma change your life, I'mma change it
I'mma change your life (life)
I'mma change your life, I'mma change it
I'mma change your life (life)
I'mma change your life, I'mma change it
I'mma change your life (life)

If you could listen more than you speak
I'd get you everything that you need
I'm talkin' bout red bottoms, LV
Even extension plus in your weave
I be blowing on strong weed when we ride
And everybody just lookin'
But ain't nan nigga gon' hop up
They like "Nah shawty, she tooken!"
I'ma get you you up out that corner shop
Put you up in Neiman Marcus
Where you supposed to shop
Hey let me show you that watch
You supposed to wear
Hey get up out that Honda Civic
Get your ass in here
Tell your Mom and Dad that you straight
Don't worry 'bout it you got it
You fly over in coach and fly back in a jet
Hustle gang on your chest
Ain't no problem don't stress

We spend our winters in the Summer of Australia
Eating crumpets with the sailors
On acres without the neighbours
We fast-forward four years more
We a long way from piss poor
And all the shit that we endured
I told you what you was in for so...

I'mma change your life, I'mma change it
I'mma change your life (life)
I'mma change your life, I'mma change it
I'mma change your life (life)
I'mma change your life, I'mma change it
I'mma change your life (life)
I'mma change your life, I'mma change it

Once you go great, you never go good
You never go back, even if you could
I'll show you my way, I got that good-good
You never go back, even if you could

Have you ever wished your life would change?
Woke up and you lived your dreams
Baby I could help you make that change
I can show you how to do this thing
