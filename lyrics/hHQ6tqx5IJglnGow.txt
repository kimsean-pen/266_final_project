I see them coming in the middle of the night
I never thought I could be the tough guy
They heard me breathing and my heart beating fast
I never thought my confident would last
What I did and you know

It's the risk that you take
It's a nightmare before you can wake
The quick and the dead
The quick and the dead will find you (will find you)
Will find you (will find you)
The quick and the dead
The quick and the dead will find you (will find you)
Will find you (will find you)

I see you bang your head against the wall
But doesn't make no sense to me at all
I can hear your voice but I can't understand it
What have you become?
This thing is never ending
'Cause it is and you know

It's the risk that you take
It's a nightmare before you can wake
The quick and the dead
The quick and the dead will find you (will find you)
Will find you (will find you)
The quick and the dead
The quick and the dead will find you (will find you)
Will find you (will find you)

It's the risk that you take
It's a nightmare before you can wake
The quick and the dead
The quick and the dead will find you (will find you)
Will find you (will find you)
7x The quick and the dead
The quick and the dead will find you (will find you)
Will find you (will find you)
