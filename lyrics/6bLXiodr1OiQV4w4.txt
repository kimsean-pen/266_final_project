Things could be stranger but I don't know how
I'm going thru changes now
Could spend a lifetime tryin' to figure it out
I'm going thru changes now

That have just begun
Under a purple sun
There are many reasons we are what we've become
I'm going thru changes
Rippin' out pages
I'm going thru changes now

I knew it once but I forgot
I'm going thru changes now
We want everything but what we got
I'm going thru changes now
Maybe it's too soon
Under a purple moon
But I'd ride off with you in a big balloon
I'm going thru changes
Rattlin' cages
I'm going thru changes now
Things could be different but I don't know how
I'm going thru changes
Thru all of this strangeness
I'm going thru changes now
