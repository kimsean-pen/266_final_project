Oh, that was such a short goodbye
Never get to say exactly what I want in front of you
I always fall apart at the worst thoughts of crashing down
I know you know this isn't what you signed up for

I'll never let this go
I'm in a different state every night
We're kept together by highways and telephone lines

I'll never let this go
I'm in a different state every night
We're kept together by highways and telephone lines

The mile markers help me countdown
The next time I'll be around

The only thing I'll leave my own
Is fallen leaves covering the ground
And I'll tell the sheriff your complexion
I hope you know I was waiting for

I'll never let this go
I'm in a different state every night
we're kept together by highways and telephone lines

I'll never let this go
I'm in a different state every night
we're kept together by highways and telephone lines

A long road, I've seen it all
Never wanting to look back
This long road, I've spent so much time

I'm glad you're willing to waiting for me
Cause I'll never let this go
I'm in a different state every night
We're kept together by highways and telephone lines

I'll never let this go (go!
I'm in a different state every night
We're kept together by highways and telephone lines
