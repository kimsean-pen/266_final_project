Keeping up nostalgic
Want to own tomorrow
Discipline is his passion
Now is enough

Outside the trains don't run on time
He believes it's not coincidence
He thinks the blood will run them down
Hold, it's no castle
It's once it's white to run and fetch
Order his obsession, order, order

Discipline is his passion
Now the stench is done
Order his obsession
Now the stench is done

Outside the trains don't run on time
He believes it's not coincidence
He thinks the blood will run them down
Hold, it's no castle
It's once it's white to run and fetch
Order his obsession

The trains don't run on time
The scoundrel discipline is his passion
Now stench is done
Outside the trains don't run on time
