(Do what you wanna do)
(Don't let 'em run you)

(Do what you wanna do)
(Do what you wanna do)
(Do what you wanna do)
(Don't let 'em run you)

It doesn't matter what they say
I won't accept it in any single way
And out through the floors and out through the cabling
They're permeating it through every single day

But I won't be confined by their regimented borders
We hold the strength of over fifty thousand soldiers
We're not duty bound to anybody's orders
(C'mon everybody now) Don't let 'em run you

What you wanna do
What you wanna do
What you wanna do
Don't let 'em run you

What you wanna do
What you wanna do
What you wanna do
Don't let 'em run you

(What you wanna do)
(What you wanna do)
(What you wanna do)
(Don't let 'em run you)

Don't let 'em run you

Don't let 'em run you

They're gonna take it all away
This is a war and the enemy's engaging
But you can see through their lies
And decide for your life

But I won't be confined by their regimented borders
We hold the strength of over fifty thousand soldiers
We're not duty bound to anybody's orders
(C'mon everybody now) Don't let 'em run you

It doesn't matter what they say
I won't accept it in any single way
And out through the floors and out through the cabling
They're permeating it through every single day

But I won't be confined by their regimented borders
We hold the strength of over fifty thousand soldiers
We're not duty bound to anybody's orders
(C'mon everybody now) Don't let 'em run you

(What you gonna do?)
(What you gonna do?)
(What you gonna do?)
(Don't let 'em run you)

Don't let 'em run you

You
You
You

Don't let 'em run you

Don't let 'em run you

They're gonna take it all away
This is a war and the enemy's engaging
But you can see through their lies
And decide for your life

I won't be confined by their regimented borders
We hold the strength of over fifty thousand soldiers
We're not duty bound to anybody's orders
(C'mon everybody now) Don't let 'em run you
