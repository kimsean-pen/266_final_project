I could never understand it
Why you turned me away
There's no ordinary living
In an ordinary day
You seem to be every wind
That blows through my dreams
You seem to be every picture
In every magazine
Being with you
Being with you
Has just left me broken-hearted
Being with you
Being with you
Who will kill the pain inside?
I've been singing to mountains
And talking to trees
Early mornings I rise
Feeling weak in the knees
You're the blood in my veins
There's really no doubt, oh no
You're that sweet summer rain
At the end of the cloud
Being with you
Being with you
Has just left me broken-hearted
Being with you
Being with you
Who will kill the hurt inside?
Watch the sunlight on my wall
A postcard down the hall
It's oh so pretty
A voice is speaking very slow
From a cell phone down below
- "Don't ever leave me..."
- "Don't ever leave me..."
Being with you
Being with you
Has just left me broken-hearted
Being with you
Being with you
Who will kill the hurt inside?
Inside?
Who will kill the hurt inside?
Who will kill the hurt inside?
- "Don't ever leave me..."
Who will kill the hurt inside?
