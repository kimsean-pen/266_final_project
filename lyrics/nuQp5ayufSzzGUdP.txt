Aapni bahon mai laike
Mujhai pyaar karne do
Dilo jan se, pyaar ka
Izhaar karne do

(Take me in your arms
Let me love you
From the bottom of my heart and soul
Let me express my love)

Hey little boy, with those big brown eyes
You don't know what you do to me
I'm just a girl, and I'm in disguise
Just trying to be a woman

It doesn't matter how we get there
Can do this if we try
Sometimes I just sit and wonder
If this is good and why

Let me love you, I know that I can
If you take on me then you'll understand
So let me love you, I'll hold on tight
If not for tomorrow then maybe tonight

Hey little girl, with those big blue eyes
You know what you're doin'
You're so grown up, I watch you grind
The little nut you're screwin'

It doesn't matter if you mean it
Maybe I'm not your kind
Sometimes I just sit and wonder
If love is hard to find

Let me love you, I know that I can
If you take on me then you'll understand
So let me love you, I'll hold on tight
If not for tomorrow then maybe tonight

Dilo jan se, pyaar ka
Izhaar karne do

(From the bottom of my heart and soul
Let me express my love)

If a girl loves a boy
And she loves a girl
What can you do?
At the end of the day
There's nothin' left to say,
But I love you
(But I love you)

Let me love you, I know that I can
If you take on me then you'll understand
So let me love you, I'll hold on tight
If not for tomorrow then maybe tonight
(Repeat to Fade)
