She said, "I've got no soul, I am not Nessarose
That is the way that life goes"
I said, "Just let it show, you are not Nessarose
Come on, grab your broom, let's go
Come on, grab your broom, let's blow away"
She said, "I've got no soul, I am not Nessarose
That is the way that life goes"
I said, "Just let it show that you're not Nessarose
Come on, grab your broom, let's go
Come on, grab your broom, let's blow"
I don't know where she ends and where I begin
The girl with green oily skin, she ends where I begin
I don't know where she ends and where I begin
The girl with green oily skin, she ends where I begin
Look at Dorothy in the sickly sweet undertow
Look at Dorothy, believing and leading them all down the Yellow Brick Road
She said, "I've got no soul"
I said, "You do, though"
She said, "I've got no soul, I am not Nessarose
That's just the way that life goes
That's just the way that life blows away"
