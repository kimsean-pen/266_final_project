I hope this isn't a burden,
Thanks for having us over
We could sleep on the couch, we could sleep on the floor
We will leave before you even notice we were here
Or even notice us at all
Been having problems with our landlord,
He said he's taking us both to court
She got her hours slashed and my unemployments drying up fast
We both got worthless diplomas from worthless universities
Two bachelors in worthless studies but at least it made our parents happy
And cost a whole lot of money.
You said L.A. is only two days if we drive straight
Denver if we get tired
Said you didn't mind stopping just as long as we got out of the Midwest States
The Midwestern States
But I know somewhere in Chicago where we can stay for a little
I hope this isn't a burden,
Thanks for having us over.
Most nights we always fall asleep with
something dumb on Netflix
Some nights trash reality, kids cartoons, or shitty documentaries
Not perfect but we're good together,
me you and our bad tattoos
All our stick and pokes, all our inside jokes,
we'll regret 'em when we're dead and sober
But we're still breathing and the party ain't over.You said L.A. is only two days if we drive straight
Denver if we get tired
Said you didn't mind stopping just as long as we got out of the Midwest States
Denver if we get tired
Said you didn't mind stopping just as long as we got out of the Midwest States
