If you're gonna break his heart could you break it gently please
Cos he is all you've got and you are all he needs and
If you're going to throw it all, then throw it to the water
Tell me, tell me if you feel it all

You never felt that much, you never felt that love so
When you turned around saw him lying on the ground
You picked him up just a little bit so you could spit
In the face of what he gave you, oh what he made you and
If you're going to throw it all, then throw it to the water
Tell me, tell me if you feel it all
And just throw it to the water

If you're gonna break his heart could you break it gently please
'Cos he is all you've got and you are all he needs and
If you're going to throw it all, then throw it to the water
Tell me, tell me if you feel it all

Feel it all
And just through it to the water
