She'll lie and steal and cheat, and beg you from her knees
Make you think she means it this time
She'll tear a hole in you, the one you can't repair
But I still love her, I don't really care

When we were young
Ooooh, we did enough
When it got cold
Ooooh, we bundled up
I can't be told
Aaaah, can't be done

It's better to feel pain, than nothing at all
The opposite of love's indifference
So pay attention now
I'm standing on your porch screaming out
And I won't leave until you come downstairs

So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love

And I don't blame ya dear
For running like you did, all these years
I would do the same, your best belive
The highway signs say we're close
But I don't read those things anymore
I never trusted in my own eyes

When we were young
Ooooh, we did enough
When it got cold
Ooooh we bundled up
I can't be told
Aaaah, can't be done

So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love

Head up, love
Head up, love
Head up, love
Head up, love
