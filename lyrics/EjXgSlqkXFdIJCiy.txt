There's a fire burning inside me
Cold steel calls out my name
Tempted to give in to the rage

Torn apart by this affliction
Locked up inside myself
This life is much too young to fade

I ran away from the pain
Always breaking down inside
Incomplete
But now I see
This will be the end of me

The world around me
Sells an empty promise
They built you up just to watch you fall
It's time to meet this face to face

I ran away from the pain
Always breaking down inside
Incomplete
But now I see
This will be the end of me

Black and white melt into grey
Till every truth is stripped away
When nothing's wrong nothing's okay
Everyone has been betrayed

I ran away from the pain
Always breaking down inside
Incomplete
But now I see
This will be the end of me
I ran away from the pain
Always breaking down inside
Incomplete
But now I see
This will be the end of me
