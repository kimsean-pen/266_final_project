weep, not for martyrs
raise your head
saline waters, won't raise the dead
grief will haunt those who forget
that night is not the end

embrace this as a nightingale in song
in the darkest hour of shadows she belongs
her voice reflects the colours of dawn

raise, not a fortress
to protect from what the waters might reflect
grief will wash those who caress
that night, as though its their's

embrace this as a nightingale in song
in the darkest hour of shadows she belongs
her voice reflects the colours of dawn

there's an ocean of despair
where the roads must end
all souls must pass there
for what is broken to mend
on an island I will wait
for you to rise again

embrace this as a nightingale in song
in the darkest hour of shadows she belongs
her voice reflects the colours of dawn
it's pierces like an arrow through storm
