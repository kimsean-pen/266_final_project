I've been living through changes
And i could swing for you
I can see the veins in my hands
Are showing through

But if you disguise what
This things are doing to me
If you criticize them
I'll know that you can see

Until you realise
It's just a story

Consequently my reaction
Was getting very strange
I can see your course of action
Leading to a change

You've got to get ready for me

Is it real
Or is it treason
Is it treason

I've been living through changes
It's not the same thing every day
I hope it's not my age
But i wouldn't like to say

Mirror hopping days of coarse reaction
Oh it's very hard to fight
I tried to find a plan of action
But i couldn't get it right

Until you realise
It's just a story.
