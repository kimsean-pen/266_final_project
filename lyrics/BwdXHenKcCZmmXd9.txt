I lost all my lunch
I threw it on the ground
I don't wanna talk
Don't wanna be around
I know you're trying to help
I think that's really nice
But I know myself
I don't need your advice

I've got a hint for you
Take it
Are you hungry?
I have my shorts for you to eat

Leave me alone
I don't owe you anything
You're not my friend
You're not my mom

So please don't talk to me
You don't know anything
I am not your conversation

People will talk
But that's not what I want
I can be myself without explanation

Alone on Sunday night
I saw a ton of shit
It made me really mad
You told me not to quit
Said, this is how it is
You're giving them your life
But I don't wanna give
I want it for myself

As selfish as it is
I need it for my health
And I have stuff to do
For me, nobody else
Nobody else

So please don't talk to me
You don't know anything
I am not your conversation

People will talk
But that's not what I want
I can be myself without explanation
