When rubin nigths are done
And scarlet days behind
When half the way is done
There's nothing to remind
Of how It used to be
And how It used to feel
My darling you and me
Spinning on the wheal
Of love
When pearly hours are gone
And silver years behind
There are no battles won
The war was in your mind
Remenber how It was
And how we used to dream
Two rebels without a cause
Our youth a silent scream
Of love
When rubin nigths are done
And scarlet days behind
When half the way is done
There's nothing to remind
Of how It used to be
And how It used to feel
My darling you and me
Spinning on the wheal
