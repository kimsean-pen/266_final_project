We were shootin' sparks
In the dark at the same time, oh
I took a piece of your heart,
You took a piece of mine, oh

You said love would be the answer
The answer is love
Love, always the answer
The answer is love, always

I was staying up, you were
Dreaming at the same time
We're alone
But underneath the layers
We are lovers of the same kind, oh
Sleep long with the TV on
Sweet light with all of the answers
With nothing up above us
We're believers in the same mind, oh

We said love would
Be the answer
The answer is love
Love, always the answer
The answer is love, always

Always, always the answer
The answer
Always, always the answer
The answer is love

Love, love be kind
Love, be the answer
Love, see the sunrise
Love, meet the dancer
Love, bend the light
Love, shake the trees
Love, feel the moonlight

Always the answer, the answer
Always, always the answer
The answer is love
The answer, the answer is love
Love, always the answer
The answer is love, always
