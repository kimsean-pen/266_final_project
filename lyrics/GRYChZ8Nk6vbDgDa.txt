Play it so safe to stay on top. Shake it, imitate it, but it still sounds old.
We just can't understand why the man calls it lo-fi.
So get your bags packed now and I'll meet you on the outside.
"X"-out all self-supervision... get your keys out, now start the ignition.
We're on the verge of... All right!
When you're shipwrecked on your mattress I'll come in and show you how to hijack the past and
wind up in the right now.
Grag some clothes, three chords and a video camera.
Maybe a mic, some handwipes, a typewriter, and a hammer.
Why don't you come over now?
I'll buzz you up.
'Cause you know when you're around I can't get enough.
I'm gonna follow you, wait, straight into the late night.
'Cause you're so on fire and you already know.
A-O-A-O do it so right
A-O-A-O do it tonight
