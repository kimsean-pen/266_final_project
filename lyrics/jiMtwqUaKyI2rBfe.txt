Please move on, turn away, don't look back

You laugh as long as you can to fill the void
Unreplenished emptiness, so empty yet there's only room for one
Perhaps it was your own fault, but you'll never admit it
Your heart seems to have disappeared and left a hole
I feel sick, i feel dread
Please don't stay
I beg and i plead, please don't stay

Why do you keep going back
Your memories are fading
I can't understand your apathy for life
See you in 10 years time

The same person
Nothing has changed
And never will
Bound to your ignorance

The same person
Nothing has changed
The same person
And never will

A ghost haunting your own life
