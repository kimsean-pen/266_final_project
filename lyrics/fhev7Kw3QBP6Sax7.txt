I have such envy
For the stranger lying next to me
Who awakes in the night
And slips out into the pre-dawn light

With no words, a clean escape
No promises or messes made
And chalks it all up
To mistake, mistake, mistake

And there are no tears
Just pity and fear
And a vast ravine
Right in between

A storm at sea
The bow cracked and I was capsizing
And I sunk below
Where I swore I would never go

If you can't stand in place
You can't tell who's walking away
From who remains
Who stays, who stays, who stays

And there are no tears
Just pity and fear
And a vast ravine
Right in between

'Cause there are no tears
Just pity and fear
And I recall
The push more than the fall
The push more than the fall
