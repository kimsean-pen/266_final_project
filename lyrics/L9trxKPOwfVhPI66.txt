Higher
It's what I expect from my life
It's like a wire
That holds me back down to the ground
Oh, I hear you say
That is the way of the world
No, hear what I say
I wanna do so much in my way
Higher
I've set my limits and bounds
There's a fire
It's burnin' so hot in my head
Oh, I hear you say
That is the way of the world
No, hear what I say
I wanna do so much in my way
We got
A little time, to build up your lives
A little time, to make up our minds
A little time, to fill up our dreams
A little time
Time
A little time
A little time
A little time
Time, time, time
A little time, to build up your lives
A little time, to make up our minds
A little time, to fill up our dreams
A little time
Time
A little time, to build up your lives
A little time, to make up our minds
A little time, to fill up our dreams
A little time
Time
A little time, to build up your lives
A little time, to make up our minds
A little time, to fill up our dreams
A little time
Time
A little time, to build up your lives
A little time, to make up our minds
A little time, to fill up our dreams
A little time
Time
