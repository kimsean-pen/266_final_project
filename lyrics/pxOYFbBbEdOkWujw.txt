My friend and I were talking one evening
Beside some burning woods
Trading tales of places we came upon
When the times were good

Spoke of a girl, he viewed like no other
Whom he had come to know
I swallowed hard and listened intently
Resigned beside the glow

Always there, it's standing proudly
When all else falls down
It's all around you, didn't it find you
When you said you couldn't be found

When love calls me, I will be running swiftly
To find out just what all the fuss is all about
Unrelentless, deep in the strangest feelings
Believe me, love is full of wonderful colour

I insist that you pick the wrong one
To preach your theories to
Simmer down, we'll run for a reason
To see what faith can do

Love is a beacon on the horizon
Watch when you touch down
Reality finds you fumbling for reasons
When the chance comes 'round

When love calls me, I will be running swiftly
To find out just what all the fuss is all about
Unrelentless, deep in the strangest feelings
Believe me, love is full of wonderful colour

When love calls me, I will be running swiftly
To find out just what all the fuss is all about
Unrelentless, deep in the strangest feelings
Believe me, love is full of wonderful colour

Take my confidence to guide you
Through the fallen hope inside you
Love is full of wonderful colour

Take my confidence to guide you
Through the fallen hope inside you
Love is full of wonderful colour
