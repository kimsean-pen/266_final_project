Let's give it a shot
You and I on the court
Time ticking on the clock
Baby, I'ma try to score
'Cause you the hottest on the block
Nothin' dimmin' your light
But all the options that you got
Wouldn't ever treat you right
No

I don't need a telescope
To see the you're the one
But I do need your time
And if it ain't yours
I'd rather have none
I don't need a fortune teller
To tell me my fortune
I have a million signs
That my fortune just begun

You got me jumping like
Boom shakalaka
Boom shakalaka
(Ah)
Boom shakalaka
Boom shakalaka
(Oh)
B-boom shakalak
Boom shakalak
(Ah)
Wanna hold you down

(Ah)
Wanna hold you down

I said, back at it again
With the jumpshot
I'm aiming for you
And I won't stop
Back at it again
With the jumpshot
We could lock it down
Never unlock

I said, back at it again
With the jumpshot
(Ah)
I'm aiming for you
And I won't stop
(Oh)
Back at it again
With the jumpshot
(Ah)
We could lock it down only if

We give it a shot
You and I on the court
Time ticking on the clock
Baby, I'ma try to score
'Cause you the hottest on the block
Ain't nothin' dimmin' your light
But all the options that you got
Wouldn't ever treat you right
Oh, oh

I don't need a telescope
To see that you're the one
But I do need your time
And if it ain't yours
I'd rather have none

That my fortune just begun

Jumping into something
I don't really know what to expect
But outta your team
You're the MVP
And you'll never be less
And baby, the past was nothing but practice
Now I'm set
When you give me access
I'll just sew my heart into your chest

You got me jumping like
