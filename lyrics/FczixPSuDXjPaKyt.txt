Let me break it to you boy, I-I-I-I
I can give it to you all ni-i-i-ight
All in all, we pullin' all ni-i-i-ighters
We ain't gotta turn on them li-i-i-ights

Finna be up, ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Finna be up, ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Finna be up ah, yea-uh, finna be up ah, yea-uh
Finna be up ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh

Yuh, we up 'til the day break off, make up when I take, take off
No sleep, you my sunshine though, just me, you, and some wine, look
'Cause we trynna unwind, look, we sleep baby, sometimes, look
Yeah, we got the same schedule, sexual drive, speed through,
I just led you
Spent 15 on it and that's fine,
'cause we already been around five
Lil weed, Hennessy, kinda sound nice,
Finna need new sheets by around nine
Feelin' weak in the knees, make it bounce like bla-bla-bla
Bed smack to the wall tap-tap-tap
Wait, lemme throw it all back-back-back
Neighbor bangin' the door

Ain't no sleepin', fuck Monday, it's the weekend 'til Sunday
Add one moon, we'll be sunlight, he love that t-shirt, no undies
Ain't no sleepin', fuck Monday, it's the weekend 'til Sunday
Add one moon, we'll be sunlight, he love that t-shirt, no undies okay

Let me break it to you boy, I-I-I-I
I can give it to you all ni-i-i-ight
All in all, we pullin' all ni-i-i-ighters
We ain't gotta turn on them li-i-i-ights

Finna be up, ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Finna be up, ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Finna be up ah, yea-uh, finna be up ah, yea-uh
Finna be up ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh

Baby I just clocked out
In the middle of the night, need a snorkel
Ain't tryna knock out
Still workin' on my wine, need a back rub
Wish we could rewind to the bathtub
First night, wreckin' this suite, no pack up
Tuck me lent money in the mattress
But we ain't finna sleep on the mattress
Practice, knee-deep in your tactic
Back it up, beep beep, no Uhaul
Tossed salad, no cheese, no croutons
Set it down, taste cheap, no coupon
No drugs, this new guy, he's on
Five star, that's sweet, no futon
Damn my other girl tired, Tsundere
I ain't talkin' 'bout the tea when I Oolong

Ain't no sleepin', fuck Monday, it's the weekend 'til Sunday
Add one moon, we'll be sunlight, he love that t-shirt, no undies
Ain't no sleepin', fuck Monday, it's the weekend 'til Sunday
Add one moon, we'll be sunlight, he love that t-shirt
No undies okay, yeah

Let me break it to you boy, I-I-I-I
I can give it to you all ni-i-i-ight
All in all, we pullin' all ni-i-i-ighters
We ain't gotta turn on them li-i-i-ights

Finna be up, ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Finna be up, ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
Finna be up ah, yea-uh, finna be up ah, yea-uh
Finna be up ain't no sleepin' all night, yuh
