Sickening thoughts, your sould's in chains
Your rotted corpse brought to life again
Brain is dead but your instincts alive
Visions of death still haunt your mind

Insanity breeds in your varicose veins
Poisoned blood flows through your veins
Your breath reeks of a rotted form
And the menstrual flow of a thousand whores

Your blood it boils and rots your brain
Tortured life makes you insane
Your self control has nothing left
The only escape is through your death

Once again your at death's door
Your wasted life exists no more
Now your doomed to rot in hell
Your fucking corpse begins to smell
