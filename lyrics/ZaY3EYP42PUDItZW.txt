In another place
In another time,
In another face,
In another lie.
In another heart,
In another world,
In another girl,
we were feeling fine.
We were in love,
We were in love.

In your father's tears,
In all your mother's pain,
In all the world's fields
we'd be the same

In another world,
In another time,
In another girl,
we were feeling fine.
We were in love,
we were in love.
