Is it physical, physical
Is it chemical, chemical
Through the midnight sky
Learning to fly

Babe, you're learning to fly

And you look around
In the midnight sky
Learning to fly
Fuck 'em you're learning to fly

And the one unknown, one unknown
Is gone but still in sight
So I looked around
And I looked in his eye

And I know that I, know that I
Know the people hangin' round you treat you right
When you disappear
I heard you're learning to fly

Babe

Is it physical, physical
Is it chemical, chemical
Through the midnight sky
Learning to fly

Babe, you're learning to fly

And you look around
In the midnight sky
Learning to fly
Fuck 'em you're learning to fly

When the sun goes down
And all the people who still hang around
I sometimes check the sky
I heard you're learning to fly

Babe

Is it physical, physical
Is it chemical, chemical
Through the midnight sky
Learning to fly

Babe, you're learning to fly

And you look around
In the midnight sky
Learning to fly
Fuck 'em you're learning to fly
