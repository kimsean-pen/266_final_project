All alone at the end of the evening
And the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman
Who might have loved me
I never knew
You know I've always been a dreamer (spent my life running round)
And it's so hard to change
Can't seem to settle down
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out and turning out the same
So put me on a highway
Show me a sign
Take it to the limit
One more time
You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?
And when you're looking for your freedom (nobody seems to care)
And you can't find the door
(can't find it anywhere)
When there's nothing to believe in
Still you're coming back
You're running back
You're coming back for more...
Put me on a highway
Show me a sign
Take it to the limit
One more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
One more time
(take it to the limit)
W-e-e...
(take it to the limit)
Come on
(take it to the limit)
One more time
(take it to the limit)
W-e-e...
(take it to the limit)
We gotta
(take it to the limit)
One more time...
(take it to the limit)
(take it to the limit)
(take it to the limit)
One more time
(take it to the limit)
W-e-e...
(take it to the limit)
Come on
(take it to the limit)
One more time
(take it to the limit)
Aaah-aaah-aaah
(take it to the limit)
Aaah-aaah
(take it to the limit)
One more time...
(take it to the limit)
(take it to the limit)
