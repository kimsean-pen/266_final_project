Now and forever, Until the time is through
I can't believe it, I don't know where to start

No baby, So many questions deep inside my heart
Give me a moment before you go
There's something you ought to know.
Baby now and forever

Until the time is through (Until the time is through)
I'll be standing here

Waiting and never give up my faith in you (Give up my faith in you)
Trying to make it clear
Without your love, I'd be half a man, Maybe one day, You'll understand
Now and forever, Until the time is through
I'll be waiting!
How can I tell you, so that you can see
You know that, Love has a meaning
When you are here with me (When you are here with me baby)
Give me a moment before you go
There's something you ought to know.

Baby now and forever
Until the time is through (Until the time is through)
I'll be standing here
Waiting and never give up my faith in you (Give up my faith in you)
Trying to make it clear

Without your love, I'd be half a man, Maybe one day, You'll understand

Now and forever, Until the time is through
There is no one to comfort me
Here in my cold reality
I'm searching for words
What can I say to make you see.

Baby now, Until the time is through, I'll be Here. Baby now and forever
Until the time is through (Until the time is through)
I'll be standing here
Waiting and never give up my faith in you (Give up my faith in you)
Trying to make it clear
Without your love, I'd be half a man, Maybe one day, You'll understand
Now and forever, Until the time is through
