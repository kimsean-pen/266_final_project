I see strangers
Every night in my dreams
Locked in dark chambers
Should I know what it means?

Shadows are crawling
On the walls of this cave
While we're sleepwalking
From cradle to grave

When the spectacle swallows the true story
Where spotlights blind us to the glory

A tale without a history
Crushing echoes of my screams
I'm crawling into a tragedy
Chasing someone else's dreams
A life without a mystery
Creation of dream factory
Nothing's what it seems
Goodbye Hollywood dreams

I am a sidekick
In the story of my life
Pretending that I like it
Afraid to close my eyes

No joy in happiness
I'm on my hands and knees
On the edge of madness
On these dead end streets

When the spectacle swallows the true story
Where spotlights blind us to the glory

A tale without a history
Crushing echoes of my screams
I'm crawling into a tragedy
Chasing someone else's dreams
A life without a mystery
Creation of dream factory
Nothing's what it seems
Goodbye Hollywood dreams

Kissing in the rain
Stargazing once again
Old cliches still remain, but I want my own ending
No false solutions
No safe illusions
Come along with me into a real dream

A tale without a history
Crushing echoes of my screams
I'm crawling into a tragedy
Chasing someone else's dreams
A life without a mystery
Creation of dream factory
Nothing's what it seems
Goodbye Hollywood dreams
