You were the life and the soul
Every party that we used to go
Baby, all of the dancefloor you touched
You can turn 'em into gold

Thousands of stars in the night
Were jealous you could shine so bright
Now I'm missing your laugh and your glow
Won't rest until you let me know

So, baby change your mind
Leave that broken heart behind
'Cause the night is young
So, let it bring you back to life

Come out, come out and dance with me
If you're down, it's a remedy
'Cause all we need, is me and you
In neon blue

Come as you are, 'cause you're great
You don't need to change a thing
All your tears and your troubles can wait
We don't need to let them win

I know that you remember, when you hear the music play
All those times together baby, don't say it's too late
When the lights in the night call your name
They're waiting after you walk in

So, baby change your mind
Leave that broken heart behind
'Cause the night is young
So, let it bring you back to life

Come out, come out and dance with me
If you're down, it's a remedy
'Cause all we need, is me and you
In neon blue

Come out, come out and dance with me
If you're down, it's a remedy
'Cause all we need, is me and you
In neon blue

Come baby, take my hand and hold me tight and
Don't you ever let me go

Come out, come out and dance with me
If you're down, it's a remedy
'Cause all we need, is me and you
In neon blue

Me and you in neon blue
Me and you in neon blue
'Cause all we need, is me and you
In neon blue...

It's me and you
In neon blue...
