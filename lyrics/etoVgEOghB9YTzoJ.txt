I've got tired eyes
A black sky
Making it's home under my lash line
You keep on crying
Babe I don't mind
I keep on staring at the clock trying to pass time
In my life
It flies by
Faster than you could say
I love you, goodbye
It's almost over
You say with a sigh
Will our lives be better
When we make it to the other side?

Ah, hope we make it to the other side

Eighteen
Prom queen
We spend our time
Thinking about what we'll be doing
Walk quiet streets
Not afraid of the sounds
Nothing bad ever happens in this town
Mean dreams
Can't sleep
Younger me thought this'd be more bittersweet
But we never noticed how long it'd been
Got too caught up in the life we're living

Ah, hope we make it to the other side

And I hope
I hope
All of our homes have white fences
And I hope
I hope
Our smiles are wider than theirs is
I hope
I hope
All of our dreams are kept fragrant
And I'll meet you on the pavement
When we make it to the other side

Ah, hope we make it to the other side
