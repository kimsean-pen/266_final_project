It's a good year for a murder
She's praying to Jesus
She's pulling the trigger
There's no tears
Cause he's not here
She washes her hands
And she fixes the dinner

But soon they'll be coming to rush her away
No one's so sure if her crime had a reason
But reasons like seasons they constantly change
And the seasons of lies still like reasons are flowing, away

Away with this spilled milk?
Away with this dirty dishwater?
Away

Seventeen years and all that he gave was a daughter

It's me and the moon she says
I got no trouble with that
And I am a butterfly but you wouldn't let me die
It's me and the moon she says

And it's over, it just started
The blood stained the carpet
Her heart like a crystal
She's lucid and departed
A life left behind she can find in her mind, gone away

Away with these nightmares
Away with suburbia shakedown
Away

You marry a role and you give up your soul till you break down

It's me and the moon she says
I got no trouble with that
And I am a butterfly but you wouldn't let me die
It's me and the moon she says

But what do you say we go for a ride
What do you say we get high
But I'm so tired of days that feel like the night

It's me and the moon she says
I got no trouble with that
And I am a butterfly but you wouldn't let me die
And I am a butterfly but you wouldn't let me die
And I am a butterfly
And I am a butterfly
And I am a butterfly
