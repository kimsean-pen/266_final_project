See me become a snake
Wrapped around your neck
See me become a spike
Pushed deep in your flesh

Feel me become a tongue
Gliding softly down your spine
Feel me become the essence
That makes you cry

But there's one thing
You have to know
When you awake
Don't be surprised
'Cos you won't be alive!

Watch me become that moment
That really matters in your life
Watch me become the relic
That means so much to you

But there's one thing
You have to know
When you awake
Don't be surprised
'Cos you won't be alive!

Hear me become a cry
That means a thousand words in one
And hear me as I whisper so low
That you won't dare to breathe

See me become a snake
Wrapped around your neck
See me become a spike
Pushed deep in your flesh

See me become the one
Who sees behind your eyes
And see me become the night
From where you will never return

But there's one thing
You have to know
When you awake
Don't be surprised
'Cos you won't be alive!
