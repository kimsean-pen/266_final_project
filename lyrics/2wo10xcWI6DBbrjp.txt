Sever off the head and watch the body fall
See you in the depths, that ain't a metaphor
Sex, blood, fashion dripping holy water
Holy shit, she worshiping my dick like it's the Holy Father

Flip with the six, I'm banging your daughter cause satan exists
I keep the blade, only talk a few weeks, I cut off your wrists
Medication gets me higher than heaven, but bro I'm the shit
Better fix I saved for Hades, I'm popping the pills when I'm sick

I only exist to fall
Happens like the ghost of God
I just want to let them go
Feeling homesick, fire up that blunt, bitch
Shut up

Devilish, fucking with my guys, yuh
I make sacrifices, you make lies up
Heaven lost an angel when I signed up
I might fuck your friend, I made my mind up

I'm devilish, yuh
I'm devilish, yuh
I'm devilish, yuh
I'm devilish, yuh

Devilish, say the part you love me, yuh
I don't wanna talk, just say the part you love me, yuh

Settle down, you don't wanna see me drive the devil out
You don't wanna see my demons in your fucking house
You don't wanna face damage in your mental house
I take drugs on the daily
I take pity on the people who try to save me, yuh
God doesn't exist and even if he could
Oh Bitch you would never catch me praying

I only exist to fall
Happens like the ghost of a god
I'll just walk the earth til i'm gone
Feeling homesick
Fire up that blunt bitch
shut up
Devilish, fucking with my guys, yuh
I make sacrifices, you make lies up
Heaven lost an angel when I signed up
I might fuck your friend, I made my mind up

I'm devilish, yuh
I'm devilish, yuh
I'm devilish, yuh
I'm devilish, yuh
I'm devilish, yuh
I'm devilish, yuh
