The lights they call me
Call me to your side
The lights they blind me
They take my sight

Will you restore me?
Grace my senses again?
The lights they blind me
Soon he descends

You belong to him tonight
There is nothing I can do
You belong to him tonight
There is nothing I can do

With words unspoken
The truth is revealed
Gates fly open
Your chance to be healed

How he adores you
Will I be with you my friend?
The lights they blind me
Soon he descends

You belong to him tonight
There is nothing I can do
You belong to him tonight
There is nothing I can do

You belong to him tonight
You belong
There is nothing I can do
You belong
You belong to him tonight
You belong to him tonight
There is nothing I can do
You belong
You belong to him tonight
There is nothing I can do

You belong to him tonight
You belong
You belong
You belong
You belong
You belong
You belong...
You belong to him tonight
You belong
You belong
You belong
You belong
You belong
You belong...
