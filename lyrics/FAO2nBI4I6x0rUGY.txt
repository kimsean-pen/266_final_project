Oh life
It's just a game
No one ever tells you how to play
See different people
Go different ways
Some of them will leave you
But some of them will stay

Well our hearts keeps drumming
And the years keep coming quicker than it ever been
You're sick of the same thing but it's quicker than changing
It's too late to begin
When everybody is running but you don't know where
Time is running thin
Everybody is looking for somebody to love
But we're scared to let them in

And I say
"Oh, are there any survivors?
Am I here alone?"
I say
"Oh, are there any survivors?
Am I here alone?
Am I on my own?
Am I on my own?"

Oh, love it comes and goes
But no one ever tells you how to learn to let go
Different people
They walk different roads
Some of them will hurt you
But some of them won't
Where the bridges burning and the wheels
keeps turning quicker than it did before
Your heart screams "yes"
Your head says "no"
And you're never really sure

When everybody is running but you don't know why
Time is running short
Everybody's looking for a place to hide
There's no one left at all

And I say
"Oh, are there any survivors?
Am I here alone?"
I say
"Oh, are there any survivors?
Am I here alone?
Am I here alone?
Am I here alone?"

And I say
"Oh, are there any survivors?
Am I here alone?"
I say
"Oh, are there any survivors?
Am I here alone?"
I say
"Oh, are there any survivors?
Am I here alone?
Oh, are there any survivors?
Am I here alone?"
