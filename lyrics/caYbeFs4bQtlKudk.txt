I love you, I need you, I can't live without you
That's why I get so desperate when we start to argue
How can't you see I am crazy for you
How dare you don't believe me after all we've been trough

The way you blink
You eat, you speak, you drive
I love you and I just can't hide
Your fingertips, your feet
The curve of your lips
I love you just the way you are

I love you, I want you
I just can't control
Your steps, your moves
You want me, why're you so irresistible?

I miss you, I'll wait for you every night
We've been so busy but I'm sure we'll gonna be alright

The way you blink
You eat, you speak, you drive
I love you and I just can't hide
Your fingertips, your feet
The curve of your lips
I love you just the way you are

The way you blink
You eat, you speak, you drive
I love you and I just can't hide
Your fingertips, your feet
The curve of your lips
I love you just the way you are

The waves when you dance
The sea on your chest
The tides of the wine
Sweet life, love of mine
You love, summer rain
You're blessed

I love you, I need you, I can't live without you
That's why I get so desperate when we start to argue
I miss you, I'll wait for you every night
We've been so busy but I know we'll gonna be alright

The way you blink
You eat, you speak, you drive
I love you and I just can't hide
Your fingertips, your feet
The curve of your lips
I love you just the way you are

The way you blink
You eat, you speak, you drive
I love you and I just can't hide
Your fingertips, your feet
The curve of your lips
I love you just the way you are
