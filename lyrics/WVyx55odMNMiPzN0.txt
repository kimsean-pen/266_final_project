I'm so far from the line, yeah
I'm too deep in my mind, yeah
She calls I'll be right there
That's three calls in a night, yeah
Tell me what you think about
Staying right here instead
I didn't hear what she said
I wasn't that high, I swear
Oh, girl, what do you think about
Staying right here in bed
I didn't hear what you said
I wasn't that high, I swear
Oh,
It's happening again
Well, I don't give a fuck about friends
I'm right here
Here
Oh, baby take a look around
I'm the only one that has involved
And I'm right here
Here
One
Oh, one more you'll be fine, yeah
And I swear she was right there
The blue glow and the night ...
Tell me what you think about
Staying right here instead
I didn't hear what she said
I wasn't that high, I swear
And she don't wanna fuck around
And I don't wanna leave this bed
I didn't hear what she said,
I wasn't that high, I swear
It's happening again
Well, I don't give a fuck about friends
I'm right here
Here
Oh, baby take a look around
I'm the only one that has involved
And I'm right here
Here
I'm always ...
And girl
I'm calling you
Pick up the phone
I'm on my own
Girl, I've been taking this slow
You know I've been taking it slow
(But sure you don't know)
(All that you sure didn't know)
(Baby just pick up your phone)
'Cause I've been running all day night
It's happening again,
Well, I don't give a fuck about friends
I'm right here
Here
Oh, baby take a look around
I'm the only one that has involved
And I'm right here
Here
(End)
