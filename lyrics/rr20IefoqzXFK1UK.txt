A town of disrespect
The trains are wrecked
The night is younger then us
Nowhere is anywhere else
You keep to yourself
Stirring the dregs where I have layed
The exit signs are flashing
Dead ends they won't come to life anymore

I pledge the rest
I should have guessed
Your love was hanging by threads
Tongues tied under the moon
My love is a room
Of broken bottles and tangled webs
The misers wind their minds
Like clocks that grind their gears
On and on

And if its meant
Some accident
Some coincidence
Crumbs fall out of the sky
When you wander by
The dust clouds blow
But nobody's home
Oh won't you lay my bags
Upon on the funeral fire and sing it again

Oh won't you lay my bags
Upon on the funeral fire and sing it again
