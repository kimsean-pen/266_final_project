Say I want and I will burn you down

You say you wanna tag along
But I can smell your fear
But if you wanna hang around
Then I will stay right here

You say you know you're right or wrong
But do you care anymore?
And now you only stand alone
Cause I won't dare enter your war

Say I want and I will burn you down
