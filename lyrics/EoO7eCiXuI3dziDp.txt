Hold up a light, steady a bright
Out like a knife through the cold and dark
These eager flames can't be contained
Cities are claimed by the smallest spark

It's raining and I know we're tired
But try to raise your lamps a little higher up

Hold up a light
Hold up a light
Hold up a light till the morning comes

Hold up a light
Hold up a light
Hold up a light till the world is won

Soaking and scared
Worse for the wear
But still we dare for the light of the day
Darkness above but we're dreaming of the
New day when love burns this night away

It's raining and I know we're tired
But try to raise your lamps a little higher up

Hold up a light
Hold up a light
Hold up a light till the morning comes
Hold up a light
Hold up a light
Hold up a light till the world is won

Hold up a light
Hold up a light
Hold up a light till the morning comes
Hold up a light
Hold up a light
Hold up a light till the world is won

Hold up
Hold up
Hold up a light till the morning comes
Hold up
Hold up
Hold up a light till the world is won

Hold up a light, steady a bright
Out like a knife through the cold and dark
These eager flames can't be contained
Cities are claimed by the smallest spark

It's raining and I know we're tired
But try to raise your lamps a little higher up

Hold up a light
Hold up a light
Hold up a light till the morning comes
Hold up a light
Hold up a light
Hold up a light till the world is won

Hold up a light
Hold up a light
Hold up a light till the morning comes
Hold up a light
Hold up a light
Hold up a light till the world is won
