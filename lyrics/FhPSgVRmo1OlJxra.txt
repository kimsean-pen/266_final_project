If it's time you're needing
Then borrow mine for a while
If it's love you're needing
Come on, get mine for a while
If it's minds you're needing
I'll try and clean mine for a while
And if it's low you're feeling
I'll get you high for a while

Say I fooled you, ha
I fooled you, ha ha

I am Cain
But I'm not able
To wish this chair
To a table
Drive me home
Make me leave
And I can't be sure
If Claire hates me

If it's stars you're seeing
I'll make you blind for a while
And if it's Christmas you're needing
I'll make it snow for a while
And if it's mean you're feeling
I'll change your mind for a while
And if it's low you're feeling
I'll get you high for a while

Say I fooled you, ha
I fooled you, ha ha

I am Cain
But I'm not able
To wish this chair
To a table
Drive me home
Make me leave
And I can't be sure
If Claire hates me

And I forgot a long time ago
How you feel
And I forgot a long time ago
How to feel

If it's time you're needing
Wear a watch for a while
