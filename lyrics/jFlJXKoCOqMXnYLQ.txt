Mmm, yeah, yuh

I thought you into my life (whoa)
Look at my mind (yeah)
No better place or a time (look)

Universe must have my back, fell from the sky into my lap
And I know you know that you're my soulmate and all that

My whole life got me ready for you, ooh, ooh

Got me happy, happy
I'ma be happy, happy (yeah)

Won't get no cryin' from me (uh no)
Gonna be happy, happy

I'ma be happy, happy, yeah
Gonna be happy, happy
I'ma be happy, happy
I'ma be happy, happy, yeah
Gonna be happy, happy
I'ma be happy, happy
