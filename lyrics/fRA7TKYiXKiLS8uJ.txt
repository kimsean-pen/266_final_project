Awake at first light
My bag is packed
I'm ready to act
A little bit uptight
I'm carrying the weight
Still carrying the weight
All things come right
No turning back
I'm over the fence
A stroke of insight
I know where it takes
Won't accept any fakes

You don't have to worry
What comes around, just goes around
Black roads are burning in reddish sunset
You just keep it steady
I'm not that far, less than a mile away
The wheels are spinning leaving a trace

Remind me, remind me
Those beautiful sundays
I can't live without this
Let's get together again

Remind me, remind me
That I'm not alone
I can't live without it
The place that we call home

The future is so bright
It's built on sand
Like a fair-weather friend
So take just one bite
I carrying the weight
Still carrying the weight
Turn diamond into graphite
When things go bad
You might need a hand
I finally arrive
Made it home safe
I smile through chafe

You don't have to worry
What comes around, just goes around
Black roads are burning in reddish sunset
You just keep it steady
I'm not that far, less than a mile away
The wheels are spinning leaving a trace

What are you waiting for?
Here we go!
This night will last forever
Everyone repeat
Hit the floor
Let's make it even better!
