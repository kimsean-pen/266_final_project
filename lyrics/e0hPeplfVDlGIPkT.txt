You set me up again
You make me lose my friends
I just don't know what I'm gonna do with you

Your feet are still on the ground
So you put me down
I just don't know what I'm gonna do with you

I don't feel...
You're no big deal
No big deal

I got into a fight
Got into it tonight
I just don't know what I'm gonna do with you

You talk much to loud
When you put me down
I just don't know what I'm gonna do with you

I don't feel...
You're no big deal

You know you broke my heart
And that was just the start
I just don't know what I'm gonna do with you

You know you broke my heart
And that was just the start
I know just what I should do for you

I tell you
I don't feel...
You're big deal
No big deal
