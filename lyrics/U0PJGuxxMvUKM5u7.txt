one day
you said, you wanted to fly
a super kind
oh, and i rose
to the moon
wearing all white

one day, one year
the seasons come
the moon's still here
don't break honestly
wake up to me

what are you dreaming?
all your colours
far and clean

all your colours, back when

oooooh ooooooh

all your colours, back when
far and clean

all your colours

oooooh ooooooh
