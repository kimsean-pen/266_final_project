Fix my make up on the way
In the rearview-mirror of my daddies car
I'm a bad boy rebel, baby, born to lose
and I kinda like it
I kinda like it

Tears are running down my face
Burn that rubber like my memories
I'm a daredevil, don't blink, I break the rules
But I kinda like it
Yes I do

It will be easier
When the past is gone
The only way to go
Is the one you're on
You wil never exist again
You will never exist again

Cuz the devil don't care
The devil don't mind
85 on a 70
Don't you wanna live your life in extacy?
I ran before I paid my dues
But I kinda like it, and you'd do too

No one's watching
We will never be found
Never be found
Bridges burning
We won't ever turn around
never turn around

It will be easier
When the past is gone
The only way to go
Is the one you're on
You wil never exist again
You will never exist again
Cuz the devil don't care
The devil don't
