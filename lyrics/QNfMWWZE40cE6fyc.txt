No one cares
About their old heads
Because the new ones work just fine now don't they
They have the same size mouth and eyes
And I really don't mind
If you're always high
But I wish you'd make your mind up someday soon
And just accept all for

Who is the operator keeping all my cells together?
Who is the operator keeping all my shells together?

And no one cares
About their old heads
Because the new ones work just fine now don't they, they, they
They have the same size eyes
And I really don't mind
If you're always high
But I wish you'd make your mind up someday
And just accept all bore

Who is the operator keeping all my cells together?
Who is the operator keeping all my shells together?
Who is the operator keeping all my cells together?
Who is the operator keeping all my shells together?
