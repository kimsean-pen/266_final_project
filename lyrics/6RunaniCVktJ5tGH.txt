I'll be waitin' in the kitchen
Where the butter melts on the stove
Mixing, fixing, finger-lickin'
Till you walk right through my backdoor

Hey baby, hey hey baby
Now, I've left several many messages
Hey baby, hey hey baby
Something hot for the holidays
Hey baby, hey hey baby
Now, I've left several many messages
Hey baby, hey hey baby
Now come and get it

Come and taste my Christmas Cookies
From my lovin' oven
Come and taste my Christmas Cookies
From my pretty little lovin' o-o-oven

If you don't come and get these goodies
Then I'll have to give them away
I'll go and gather all your buddies
Spread 'em out on a decorative tray

I need you here... Now
I need you here... Now
I need you here... Now
Yes, honey, I made them cookies for you
And I know how you love 'em

Come and taste my Christmas Cookies
From my lovin' oven
Come and taste my Christmas Cookies
From my pretty little lovin' o-o-oven

Come and taste my Christmas Cookies
From my lovin' oven, yeah
Come and taste my, won't you taste my
From my pretty little lovin' o-o-oven

Mmmm-mh
Delicious
