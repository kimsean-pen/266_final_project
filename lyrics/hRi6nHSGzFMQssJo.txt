You could not forgive once you...
... quite so bad,
I'm not getting half for what I am
Thought that we was sad, but now I
I've learned
So tell me what's on your mind
Tell me what's on your mind
Tell me what's on your mind
Cause I can't find it
All my problems ...stand from you
...but giants, ... you to do
I'm not getting half the way I should
Once I was upset, now I feel, feel good
So tell me what's on your mind
Tell me what's on your mind
Tell me what's on your mind
Cause I can't find it
All my time I give to you
All those... through
Love like yours will have to wait
Not my style to hesitate
I'm not saying that I've tried
I'm enough to ...
All I have to say to you
Is anything you want me to
So tell me what's on your mind
Tell me what's on your mind
Tell me what's on your mind
Cause I can't find it.
