16 dollars in a back street corner
Is enough for a beautiful day
I see a window open
Hearing Aerosmith rocking with
Dick Brave "Walk This Way"

I need a quick drink
More volume for the beat
I see the cats are playing dice

It's seven in the morning
And you lost all your money
To a fat lady singing
Boogie woogie chili honey

I've been walking the streets again
But it's the same old thing I'll do it again
Just to see what the day will bring
But it's the same old song I'll do it again

I'll bring you home my baby, I will
I would love to bring you home
I would love to bring you home
I would love to bring you home

16 hours on my back in a corner
And an empty bottle of Jack and a bitch
Well, I'm sorry to inform you that
The poison in my body guiding you
To walk away from this mess

I need a quick drink
More volume for the beat
I see the cats are playing dice

It's seven in the morning
And you lost all your money
To a fat lady singing
Boogie woogie chili honey

I've been walking the streets again
But it's the same old thing I'll do it again
Just to see what the day will bring
But it's the same old song I'll do it again

I'll bring you home my baby, I will
I would love to bring you home
I would love to bring you home
I would love to bring you home

16 dollars in a back street corner

Hearing Aerosmith rocking with

And you lost all your money

But it's the same old thing I'll do it again
Just to see what the day will bring
But it's the same old song I'll do it again
I'll bring you home my baby, I will
I would love to bring you home
I would love to bring you home
I would love to bring you home
