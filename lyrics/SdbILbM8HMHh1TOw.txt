It's the weekend and I'm looking forward to you coming
In more ways than you hoppin in your car to come and see me believe me
I done clean the spot and put on your favorite panties
The one you say look like Diamond's from Players Club I'm wylin
You know I'm wylin, yeah

Red Bottoms La Perla
Hair touching your shoulder
I'm going to work like Rihanna
Told you til that sauce is all over

Let it fall on me
Let it, let it fall on me

It's the weekend and I'm greedy I've been a good girl all week
So I can dirty them sheets from Friday to Sunday no breaks
I'm ready to ride you like I'm about
to win a prize at the Kentucky Derby
I'm your jockey you heard me

Red bottoms La Perla
Hair touching your shoulder
I'm going to work like Rihanna
Told you til that sauce is all over
Til that sauce is all over
Don't be stingy when I'm greedy
I need you to let it fall on me

Let it fall on me
Let it fall (let it fall on me)
Let it fall on me
Let it fall on me
Let it fall on me

It's the weekend and I'm ready for you
You don't need to be gentle I can take all of you
It's the weekend and I'm ready for you
You don't gotta rush you can take your time to let it

Let it, let it fall on
Make it fall on (let it fall on me)
Make it fall on me
Make it rain on me
(Let it fall on me)

(Only for you)
(Nobody else but you)
