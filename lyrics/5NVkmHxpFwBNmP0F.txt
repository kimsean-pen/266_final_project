Björk
Heeeeeeee how!
He how!
He how!

Einar
One person calls someone
To pour the water,
because it takes two to pour the water,

Björk
To plough takes two as well,
But only one to hold up the sky.

Einar
To plough takes two as well,
But only one to hold up the sky.

Einar
One plays the harp, beats a rock with a stick,

Björk
One plays the harp, beats a rock with a stick,
Becomes a priest at least, a delicious demon.

Einar
Least, a delicious demon.

Björk
Delicious demon, delicious demon,
Delicious demon, delicious demon

Björk
Two men need one money
But one money needs no man,
One is on ones knees, loses ones head,
Except maybe a delicious demon.

Einar
Two men need one money
But one money needs no man,

Einar and Björk
One is on ones knees, loses ones head,
Except maybe a delicious demon.
Then one is no longer, then one is no longer

Björk
No longer!
Delicious demon, oh, delicious demon,
Oh delicious, delicious demon...
So delicious!
