If the fish swam out of the ocean
And grew legs and they started walking
And the apes climbed down from the trees
And grew tall and they started talking
And the stars fell out of the sky
And the tears rolled into the ocean
And now I'm looking for a reason why
You even set my world into motion
'Cause if you're not really here

Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
But it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here
Then I don't want to be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
I look up into the night sky

And see a thousand eyes staring back

And all around these golden beacons
I see nothing but black
I feel a way of something beyond them
I don't see what I can feel
If vision is the only validation
Then most of my life isn't real
'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter

Now I'm filled to the top with fear
But it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here
Then I don't want to be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold

Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
Black and gold
'Cause if you're not really here

Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
But it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here
Then I don't want to be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
Black and gold, black and gold
