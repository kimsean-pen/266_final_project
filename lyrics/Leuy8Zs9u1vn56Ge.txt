I am the poet, the prophet in the pit
like a hollow-point bullet
straight through the head, i never miss you
Within the dark communion of self awareness
there lies a void called ego
an endless fusion of stillness and chaos
to bring its death can bring rebirth
I want to freeze the time
dissolve into gray
as we disintegrate the light
dissolve into gray
Let the rain come down
let the solitude surround

I want to change the lines
dissolve into gray
and purify the divide
dissolve into gray
Are we ever free
or slaves to technology?
Outside the fallen walls of pride and prejudice
there is a voice that speaks in circles
empty illusions still fall before us
there is no future, so profess your pain
I want to freeze the time
dissolve into gray
as we disintegrate the light
dissolve into gray
Let the rain come down
let the solitude surround
I want to change the lines
dissolve into gray
and purify the divide
dissolve into gray
Are we ever free
or slaves to technology?
