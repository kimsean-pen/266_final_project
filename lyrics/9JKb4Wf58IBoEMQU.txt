Now I can feel you creeping up so near
You are the faint voice that I try so hard to avoid and not hear
My mind's put to the test
Do I bend or break, go backwards and snap under the stress?
I had a feeling it could end this way
So let me sit here and explain
How years have stacked and set in frame
A beautiful portrait of some sorts
With my funeral, a precipice
Spending life struggling
To push the boulder straight over the edge
Truth is that I know you so well
(I know you, I know you, I know you, I know you)
Truth is that I know you so well
(I know you, I know you, I know you, I know you)
Truth is that I know you so well
(I know you, I know you, I know you, I know you)
Truth is that I know you so well

There's only one way
There's only one way
Stuck in my head everyday
No relief from alarm till I sleep
And I know myself so well and can tell that I'm weak
But believe I try to power through
But I feel like I'm preparing for the big defeat
Brace for more that's what you're put here for
My spirit was broken and stolen by systems
That wanna see me down (wanna see me down!)
Dreams last till you wake up and mold into the way you love yourself
Just get away, Just get away
While you still can
Just get away, Just get away
While you still can
Just get away, Just get away
While you still can
Just get away, Just get away
While you still can
Just get away, Just get away
While you still can
I'm your biggest fan
Inner and subconscious make me proud to wear your skin
I bleed red American piece of shit muddy blood from impatient me
