Can't do crowds
Not our scene
We get anxiety
That's so you
That's so me
That's so us

Wearing black
At the beach
Looking pale
Feeling chic
That's so you
That's so me
That's so us

We think that politics is such a waste of time
We've been a wreck together since 2009
We've seen each other naked, seen each other cry
You make me not wanna die

What I like about you, baby
Is how you annoy me daily
But you still fucking amaze me
That's so us, that's so us

Yeah, we're both a lot to handle
I'm a Leo, you're a Cancer
We take on the world together
That's so us, that's so us

We make peppermint tea
And watch Space Odyssey
That's so you
That's so me
That's so us

And I sing in the car
While you play air guitar
That's so you
That's so me
That's so us

We think that politics is such a waste of time
We've been a wreck together since 2009
We've seen each other naked, seen each other cry
You make me not wanna die

What I like about you baby
Is how you annoy me daily
But you still fucking amaze me
That's so us, that's so us

Yeah, we're both a lot to handle
I'm a Leo, you're a Cancer
We take on the world together
That's so us, that's so us

Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh
That's so us, that's so us
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh
That's so us, that's so us

When I'm sick
When I'm sad
You always bring me back
When you're wild
When you're mad
I'm your girl

Shit gets real
Good and bad
But we cry 'til we laugh
Through the pain
Through the fads
That's so us (that's so us)

What I like about you baby
Is how you annoy me daily
But you still fucking amaze me
That's so us, that's so us

Yeah, we're both a lot to handle
I'm a Leo, you're a Cancer
We take on the world together
That's so us, that's so us

Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh
That's so us, that's so us
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh
Ahhh
