I got the rust, I got the grime
I got love that'll make you turn wild
I got taste, I got lust
I got all those things that you want
With all the paint you get the picture
Up to you as to how you make it bigger
I want love, so numb
It mean more when you can't get enough of it

Is this, heavy for you?
Am I, heavy for you?
Is this, heavy for you?
Am I, too
Damn heavy for you?
Is this, heavy for you?
Am I, heavy for you?
Is this, too
Damn heavy for you?
Am I, heavy for you?
Is this, heavy for you?
Am I, too
Damn heavy for you?
Is this, heavy for you?
Am I, heavy for you?
Too damn-

I got the boom, I got the bang
I got the whole damn stick in my hand
I got truth, I've got cold
When the heart of a man got soul
No joke, I got choked
[?] somethin' got sold
Through the flames, from the road
I want it all, couldn't [?]

Is this, heavy for you?
Am I, heavy for you?
Is this, heavy for you?
Am I, too
Damn heavy for you?
Is this, heavy for you?
Am I, heavy for you?
Is this, too
Damn heavy for you?
Am I, heavy for you?
Is this, heavy for you?
Am I, too
Damn heavy for you?
Is this, heavy for you?
Am I, heavy for you?
Too damn-

I wanna give you something
I've gotta give you something
Let me show you something
I gotta give you something
I wanna give you something
Let me show you something

I wanna give you something
I gotta give you something
Let me show you something
I gotta give you something

'Cause it's, heavy for you
It's so, heavy for you
Like I'm, heavy for you
It's just, too
Damn heavy for you
It's so, heavy for you
Like I'm, heavy for you
It's just, too
Damn heavy for you?
It's so, heavy for you
Like I'm, heavy for you
It's just, too
Damn heavy for you?
It's so, heavy for you
Like I'm, heavy for you
It's just, too damn-
