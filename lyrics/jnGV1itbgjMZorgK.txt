Got love, that's what you need
I got three or four babies sittin' on my knee
I got good love, waitin' for you
I come up sneakin' 'round the corner of the avenue.

You gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, or I will get you
You know you gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, I will get you.

There's one thing that's on my mind
And that's getting hold of you before I serve my time
I'll got keep on, with my heavy load
Till I see you come a-strollin' down that open road.

You gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, before I'll get you
Now that you know you gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, or I will get you
Now it feelin' so, Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, or I will get you
You know, before you gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, I will get you.

I love you, Ma-Ma-Ma Belle
That's why I want to get it all, well, I'm sure you can tell
I got good soul runnin' so deep
Gonna get you in the corner so that I can keep.

Can't you hear me once, Ma-Ma-Ma Belle?
Or I will get you, yeah
You know, Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, or I will get you, yeah
And you gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, or I will get you, yeah
Now you gotta Ma-Ma-Ma Belle, or I will get you, yeah.

Or I will see you 'round, 'round, get 'round down
