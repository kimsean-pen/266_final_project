The greatest let down leaves
(A taste in my mouth, taste in my mouth)
A blind and blank routine
(We're waiting it out, waiting it out)
They're wearing me out with their happy town lies
(The small town weather, small town weather)
The ordinary sound of the ordinary mind
(We're living it forever, living it forever)
We've heard it all ten thousand times
Can you feel your heart sink? I can feel mine
We've heard it all ten thousand times
Can you feel your heart sink? I can feel mine
I can feel mine
Inch by inch we find
(We're never satisfied, never satisfied)
We're leaving it behind
(And doubts go outside, doubts go outside)
We burn ourselves out just to calm ourselves down
(A space to recover, space to recover)
A little escape from the weight of this town
(We need to find another, need to find another)
We've heard it all ten thousand times
Can you feel your heart sink? I can feel mine
We've heard it all ten thousand times
Can you feel your heart sink? I can feel mine
I can feel mine
And we'll sacrifice, for the opposites
Cause there must be more and we know it
We've heard it all ten thousand times
(And we'll sacrifice, for the opposites)
Can you feel your heart sink? I can feel mine
(Cause there must be more and we know there is)
We've heard it all ten thousand times
(And we'll sacrifice, for the opposites)
Can you feel your heart sink? I can feel mine
(Cause there must be more and we know it)
And we know it
And we know it
