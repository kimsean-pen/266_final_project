A couple of years and I'm a silhouette
My halo is broken now and I'm all that's left
I hate to disappoint but it's the way things went
I was bound to the things I did and after what was said

Tie up these loose ends
These voices are calling me out
I've got the solution
You can feed me to something
That is leaving this doubt

Whoa, I'm losing hope
There's a hole in my heart
That's been cut out of stone

Whoa, cold comes cold goes
Could you fill this hole?
'Cause I can't do it alone

A couple of tears and I'm a broken mess
The sadness has taken me far too deep in regret
So sing me a song about something good
My heart's on the thrashing floor
And I've done every single thing I could

I use to believe in some kind of feelin'
That could change everything I thought I knew
But that door is closed and
My heart feels like it's frozen
If you hear me I can feel you

Whoa, I'm losing hope
There's a hole in my heart
That's been cut out of stone

Whoa, cold comes cold goes
Could you fill this hole?
'Cause I can't do it alone

The coldest heart can be brought to life
When it's thrown into the fire of goodbyes
The coldest heart can be brought to life
When it's thrown into the fire of goodbyes

The coldest heart can be brought to life
When it's thrown into the fire of goodbyes
The coldest heart can be brought to life
When it's thrown into the fire of goodbyes

Whoa, I'm losing hope
There's a hole in my heart
That's been cut out of stone

Whoa, cold comes cold goes
Could you fill this hole?
'Cause I can't do it alone

Whoa, I'm losing hope
There's a hole in my heart
That's been cut out of stone

Whoa, cold comes cold goes
Could you fill this hole?
'Cause I can't do it alone

I've got the coldest heart
('Cause I can't do it alone)
I've got the coldest heart
I've got the coldest heart
I've got the coldest heart
