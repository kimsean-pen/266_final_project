Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back
No more. No more. No more. No more.
Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back no more
Woman, oh, woman don't you treat me so mean
Your the meanest old woman that I've ever seen
But I guess if you say so
I have to pack my things and go

That's right!
Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back
No more. No more. No more. No more.
Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back no more

Baby. Listen, baby, don't you treat me this way
'Cause I'll be back on me feet someday
Don't care if you do 'cause it's understood
You ain't got no money. You just ain't no good
Well, I guess if you say so
I have to pack my things and go
That's right!

Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back
No more. No more. No more. No more.

Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back no more
