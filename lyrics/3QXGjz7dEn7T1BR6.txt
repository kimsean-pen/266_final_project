When I was just a little boy
Standin' to my Daddy's knee
My Poppa said "Son, don't let the man get you
And do what he done to me
'Cause he'll get you Lord
Get you right now, now"

Well I can remember the Fourth of July
Runnin' through the backwood bay
I can still hear my old hound dog barkin'
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there

Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou, alright now
Born on the bayou
Do it, do it

Wish I were back on the bayou
Rollin' with some Cajun Queen
Wish that I were a fast freight train
A just a-choogling on down to New Orleans

Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou
Do it, do it

I can remember the Fourth of July
Runnin' through the backwood bay
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin'
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there

Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou
Alright, do
Do it, do it, do it, do it
