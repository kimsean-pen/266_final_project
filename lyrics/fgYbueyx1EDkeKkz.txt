Put on my blue suede shoes, and I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta
Blues, in the middle of the pouring rain
W.C. Handy - won't you look down over me
Yeah! I got a first class ticket, but I'm as blue as a girl can be
Then I'm walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?
Saw the ghost of Elvis, on Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
I watched him walk right through
Now secured that I did not see him
He just hovered around his tomb
Yhere's a pretty little thing, waiting for the King
Down in the Jungle Room
When I was walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?
Walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?
They're got catfish on the table
They're got gospel in the air
Reverend Green be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
But boy you've got a prayer in Memphis
Now Gabriel plays piano, every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see him
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number, and I sang with all my might
He said: Tell me are you a Christian child?
And I said, man I am tonight
Walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?
Walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of the Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?
Put on my blue suede shoes
