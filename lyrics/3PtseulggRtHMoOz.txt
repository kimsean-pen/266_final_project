In the land described as the beyond
In lack of better directional insight
Something stirs and leaps
Casual roads of reason intersect
Conceptual wormholes in the lawless black
In ancient matter

Unknown kin, as they thoroughfare
Unexplored utopia lineage
Accumulation
Icebergs of the abyss never melts
Ideal energy, it's building within
Unlike loyalty

Cadaverous and spirited; I work
Composite and uniform; I sacrifice
Resist the wisdom
With limited perception we see
We learn, and we laugh, and we sleep,
And we watch
Logic is worthless

Storm of the ions, ecstatic mind
Seeps through the cracks, it fills up the bones
I remember now
The here and the now - it is nothing
...This Eve - haunted by a storm of memories
Immortality

Then it was quiet, then it was dark
Trees, dreams, and the runes
- Makes for a future
I'm on the inside
Looking at the sky, I think of you
Life is a room, in between the greater halls
There we'll met again

I can't make out what is what is what
In this storm of memories
Now it all comes back
I know there's strength in my blood
I can hear the past
Fearing not
Time has come... listen
There's a storm
Within
Storm of the ions, ecstatic mind
Seeps through the cracks, it fills up the bones
I remember now
The here and the now - it is nothing
...This Eve - haunted by a storm of memories
Immortality

Then it was quiet, then it was dark
Trees, dreams, and the runes
- Makes for a future
I'm on the inside
Looking at the sky, I think of you
Life is a room, in between the greater halls
There we'll met again

Unknown kin, as they thoroughfare
Unexplored utopia lineage
Accumulation
Icebergs of the abyss never melts
Ideal energy, it's building within
Unlike loyalty

Cadaverous and spirited; I work
Composite and uniform; I sacrifice
Resist the wisdom
With limited perception we see
-We learn, and we laugh, and we sleep,
And we watch
Logic is worthless
