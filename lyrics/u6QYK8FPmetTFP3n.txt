I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone

I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone
You're tryin' to make your mark in society
You're usin' all the tricks that you used on me
You're readin' all them high fashion magazines

The clothes you're wearin', girl, are causin' public scenes
I said I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone
I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone (no!)
Not your steppin' stone
Not your steppin' stone

When I first met you, girl, you didn't have no shoes
But now you're walkin' 'round like you're front page news
You been awful careful 'bout the friends you choose
But you won't find my name in your book of Who's Who

I said I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone (no, girl, not me!)
I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone (no!)

Not your steppin' stone

I'm not your steppin' stone
Not your steppin' stone
No, girl, I'm not your steppin' stone
Not your steppin' stone
