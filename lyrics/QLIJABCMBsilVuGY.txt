You are my angel
And I believe that you were sent from above
Showing me guidance with unconditional love
And I know that it's true

You are my best friend
I can't believe that you came into my life
Giving me strength and I feel so safe in your arms
I will come to no harm

Every time you go away, I will follow you
When you're running scared and you hide away
I'm right beside you, I am there

I have never been touched like this by another
Or moved or kissed or loved by my lover
Like you love me

You are my angel
And I thank God that you came into my life
You are the one thing I see when I close my eyes
In the dark of the night

Every time you go away, I will follow you
When you're running scared and you hide away
I'm right beside you, I am there

I have never been touched like this by another
Or moved or kissed or loved by my lover
I have never been touched like this by another
Or moved or kissed or loved by my lover

You take me down and bring me back again
You take me down and bring me back again
And take me down, and take me down

I have never been touched like this by another
Or moved or kissed or loved by my lover
I have never been touched like this by another
Or moved or kissed or loved by my lover

I have never been touched like this by another
Or moved or kissed or loved by my lover
I have never been touched like this by another
Or moved or kissed or loved by my lover
