Human race
Comic puppets
Body is blood
Flesh and skin
Deformed fetus
Hiding, in the face and thoughts
Deformed fetus
So deplorable

Our body
Is a vermin, In which
The entity for eternity hides
Is the only mass which will remain

BONES - the book of life
BONES - the pure identity
BONES - the only residual
BONES - the breath of eternity

Life gets through
Decay is swallowing it
It's emptiness
End of thinking
Through the flesh and skin
The skeleton is emerging now
And the only reality comes
Life gets through

Our body
Is a vermin
In which
The entity for eternity hides
Is the only mass
Which will remain

BONES - the book of life
BONES - the pure identity
BONES - the only residual
BONES - the breath of eternity

Life gets through
Decay is swallowing it
It's emptiness
End of thinking
