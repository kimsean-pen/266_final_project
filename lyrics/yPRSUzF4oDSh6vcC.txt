The system they set for enslavement
In present prevades
A corporate monarch of bastards
We've all been betrayed

Some that we question
Some that we change
The next generation fully disengaged
Unconscious society serving as slaves
To futures defying the ones that can wait

And now were just evading
This conversation must be had
And now were just retraining
The constitution of disrepair
In disrepair

A system they set for enslavement
In present prevades
A corporate monarch of bastards
We've all be betrayed

Media fought with the duplicity
Controlled by machines of the un
The drug warrant raided the land of the free
While plotting the death of a democracy

And now were just evading
This conversation must be had
You know we just returning
The constitution of despair
And now we just evading
This conversation must be had
You know we just returning
This constitution
This constitution of despair

In disrepair
A constitution in disrepair
In desrepair
A constitution in disrepair
In desrepair

And now were just evading
This conversation must be had
You know we just returning
The constitution of despair
And now we just evading
This conversation must be had
You know we just returning
This constitution
This constitution of despair

In disrepair
