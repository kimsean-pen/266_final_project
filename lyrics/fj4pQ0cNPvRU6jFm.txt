I can tell you now
When I'm here to listen
To what I've got to say
All my words unplanned
Just like us they are waiting
To come together
I don't know if we're ready to take our train

Oh I, oh I, I'm gonna fix this world up for you
I'll try, I'll try to build it all around you
You'll never gonna have to be alone
You'll alway know you got someone
To fix the world up for you

Well I've been out getting wrong
More times that I get it right
That I won't even realize it
But I've been doing all I can
To stop you falling
Even now I'm holding my breath for you

But you don't know, you don't know
That I'm ready to hold you now, hold you now

Oh I, oh I, I'm gonna fix this world up for you
I'll try, I'll try to build it all around you
You'll never gonna have to be alone
Yeah You'll alway now you got someone
To fix the world up for you

Gonna fix the world up, up for you
Gonna fix the world up, up for you
