Ohh
Twister, oh, does anyone see through you?
You're a twister, oh, an animal
But you're so happy, now. I didn't go along with you
So happy now, na na na na

But you're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on, hold on, hold on

Or we're gonna have to move on
We're gonna have to move on
Or we're gonna have to move on, move on, move on

I feel alright and I cried so hard
The ridiculous thoughts, oh
I feel alright, alright, alright, alright

Twister, oh, I shouldn't have trusted in you.
Twister, oh, a na na na. It's not gonna happen, no
You're not gonna make fun of me
Happen now, na na na na

But you're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on, hold on, hold on

Or we're gonna have to move on
We're gonna have to move on,
Or we're gonna have to move on, move on, move on

I feel alright and I cried so hard,
The ridiculous thoughts, oh.
I feel alright, alright, alright...
Ah, I should have lied,
But I cried so hard,
The ridiculous thoughts, ah
I should have lied, have lied, have lied, have lied
But you're gonna have to hold on

You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on

You're gonna have to hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold...
