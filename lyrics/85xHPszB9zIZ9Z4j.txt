in my head this all is in my head this all is
in my head this all is in my head this all is
in my head...

i hold on tight for this mortal ride
rest my head 'til the mornings coming down on me
i realise my own sacrifice
rest my head before somebody's going out...

in my head this all is in my head this all is
in my head this all is in my head this all is
in my head...

pray nightfall release me
then i could wander, wander to deep sleep

awake despite, another mortal night
rest my head, for the sun is shining down on me
i realise try to synchronize
rest my head or somebody's going down

in my head this all is in my head this all is
in my head this all is in my head this all is
in my head...

pray nightfall release me
then i could wander, wander to deep sleep

trying to make things work
trying to make things right
trying to make things work
without serendipity in my life...
