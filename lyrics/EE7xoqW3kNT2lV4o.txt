We are only hotter in a lot of coal
I am really telling you, we're meant to be
You might shape the world in ways impossible
But do you think that you could find a way to stay with me?

Getting high in denial
Love the wings we stole
Sleeping in and listening to Russian soul
And it feels like it seems that when I'm with you
We become each other

I don't mind if you'll find this a part of me
I would never want someone else to see
It's insane, but it's true
When it's only me and you
We become each other

We'll be like the others once we give it a thought
Fearless, reckless, don't consider anything
We were only following the shouts of our hearts
And when we fought it, we had brought the logic in

Getting high in denial
Love the wings we stole
Sleeping in and listening to Russian soul
And it feels like it seems that when I'm with you
We become each other

I don't mind if you'll find this a part of me
I would never want someone else to see
It's insane, but it's true
When it's only me and you
We become each other

Getting high...
Getting high...

Getting high...
Getting high...

Getting high in denial
Love the wings we stole
Sleeping in and listening to Russian soul
And it feels like it seems that when I'm with you
We become each other

I don't mind if you'll find this a part of me
I would never want someone else to see
It's insane, but it's true
When it's only me and you
We become each other
