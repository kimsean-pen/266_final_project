Those saints in Lockstead
Across the wasteland
Forever gone
They're home and walk along
Forever onward
Across some tundra
But it's not long before it's gone
It calls you back to mind
At once, at last
Oh goodness, mercy mine
Soldier on, but please not so long
This time
Too young and thoughtless
To comb your memories
Just give until it's gone
Some tired mantra
Calls ever onward
Shout it loud
Just make it up somehow
Well alright
That all you try to celebrate
When all you hope is that everything breaks
Just do whatever you like
Just do whatever you like
Tell me it's all just a lie
You can't scare me none
I'm still the lucky one
