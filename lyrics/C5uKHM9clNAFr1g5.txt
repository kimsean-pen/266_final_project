A walk in the park
I've got to get some sense back into my head
I'm in the dark and I can't see where I'm being led
I'd give the world to set the clock back
and act like a man
where can I turn
to save myself from this confusion

A walk in the park a step in the dark
a walk in the park a trip in the dark
I'm getting away escaping today
a walk in the park

Away from all the busy streets of my mind
I seek a straighter path
I seek a shady glade in which to unwind
but why do we go
in spite of mistakes in spite of destrucktion
life can be fun
depending on the situation

A walk in the park a step in the dark
a walk in the park a trip in the dark
I'm getting away escaping today

A walk in the park a step in the dark
a walk in the park a trip in the dark
I'm getting away escaping today
a walk in the park a step in the dark

A walk in the park, a walk in the park
I'm getting away
A walk in the park, a walk in the park
I'm getting away
