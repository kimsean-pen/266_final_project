You make me so wet
I always get what i want
I've been waiting for you in the cave

You say i've been so bad
Maybe i should spank you baby
Anyway you're gonna be my slave

Heaven and Hell's gonna turn over topsy-turvy
I know you wanna give it to me
Deeper and deeper and faster and faster delight
Your body is mine tonight

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Cause our love is gone away
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Cause our love is gone away
Ah hold me tight

I know you're a legman
You look so dumb right now
You can only wait with earnest

You should stay in the cage
This relationship never change
Always watching you like a scientist
So would you give head and give me good till i say stop
When i feel down, to bring me up
Bigger and bigger and thicker and thicker delight
I need to find the light

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Cause our love is gone away
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Cause our love is gone away
Ah hold me tight

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Ah

I don't wanna taste my time
I don't wanna taste my time
I just wanna say
I gotta say
I gotta say
Scream!

(Don't let me down)
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Cause our love is gone away
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Cause our love is gone away
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Cause our love is gone away
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Cause our love is gone away
Ah hold me tight

Don't let me down
