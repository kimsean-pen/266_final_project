No fear, no pain
Nobody left to blame
I'll try alone
Make destiny my own
I learn to free my mind
Myself I now must find
Once more
Once more

If I could fly
Like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall
I would picture it all
If I could fly
See the world through my eyes
Would not stumble nor fail
To the heavens I sail

If I could fly

So here I am
In solitude I stand
I've got dreams inside I need to realize
My faith has grown
No fear of the unknown
No more (no more)
No more

If I could fly
Like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall
I would picture it all
If I could fly
See the world through my eyes
Would not stumble nor fail
I could ravage my jail

If I could fly

If I could, if I could fly
If I could, if I could fly, if I could

If I could fly
Like the king of the sky
Could not tumble nor fall
I would picture it all
If I could fly
See the world through my eyes
Would not stumble nor fail
To the heavens I sail

If I could fly (if I could, if I could)
Like the king of the sky (fly)
Could not tumble nor fall (if I could, if I could)
I would picture it all (fly)
If I could fly (if I could, if I could)
See the world through my eyes (fly)
Would not stumble nor fail (if I could, if I could)
I could ravage my jail (fly)

If I could fly (if I could, if I could)
Like the king of the sky (fly)
Could not tumble nor fall (if I could, if I could)
I would picture it all (fly)
If I could fly (if I could, if I could)
See the world through my eyes
