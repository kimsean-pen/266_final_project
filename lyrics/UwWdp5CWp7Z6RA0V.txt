She got on a plane
Took off town bound for Santa Fe
Touched down on the edge of another world
Made a few mistakes
And it's kind of hard to fuck the pain away
Hooked on amphetamine and pearls

Hey, she drove off into the sunset
Drinkin' Pinot, singin' 'Livin' on a Prayer'
Hey, when all her childhood dreams get put to rest
Maybe in another life, she'll get somewhere
But in the end we all burn out like cigarettes

Captain on the team
Quarterback on the varsity
Crowd goes wild he throws a touchdown
But graduation came, he lost his number but he kept his name now he's
Pumpin' gas at the Texaco downtown

Hey, he drove off into the sunset
drinking Bud Light singin' 'Livin' on a Prayer'
Hey, when all his childhood dreams get put to rest
Maybe in another life, he'll get somewhere
But in the end we all burn out like cigarettes

Now I'm singing a song for you
About a childhood dream that won't come true
Somewhere I'm out in the Midwest chasin' mine
So if you're feelin' blue
I'll light up a match for you
And we'll send the world up in smoke tonight

Hey, we'll drive off into the sunset
drinkin' whiskey singin' 'Livin' on a Prayer'
Hey, when all of our childhood dreams get put to rest
Maybe in another, life we'll get somewhere
But in the end we all burn out like cigarettes
In the end we all burn out like cigarettes
In the end we all burn out like a cigarette
