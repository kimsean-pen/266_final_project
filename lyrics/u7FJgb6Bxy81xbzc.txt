Leave your Sentra in the tow lane
Take off from your brother's wedding
Pull the plug on mom days early
This is your window don't you blow it

I went and I had a scary epiphany
I'm just a magnet for negativity
I was born with a gift a special ability
I catch most people only on their worst days
The jam up and the hassle
The indignation of some asshole

When we see each other it's punches
Now maybe come across the counter
Find me outside your workplace
We'll put on a show for your workmates
