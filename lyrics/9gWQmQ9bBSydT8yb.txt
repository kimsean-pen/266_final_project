Blistered cracked and bleeding
Cold no one should know
Rain falls down a freezin'
And stickin' like a snow
Lingering suspicions
Screamin' in my head
Lies all mixed up with omissions
Aw welcome home again
It's too late for apologies they're falling at my feet

This is just the way of the world Joe said
I had to put a bullet into his head
An' then he lit up a cigarette
He decided to call up his fat friend Fred
Well he said Fred I just killed a man
I caught him laying with my girlfriend
An' now they're both dead
People can be so cold when they're dead

Callin' all the neighbors
Time to make amends
Whiskey floods the table
Aw good friends 'til the end
An' they're makin' silly faces and it's tastin' bitter sweet

This is just the way of the world Joe said
I had to put a bullet into his head
An' then he lit up a cigarette

Well he said Fred I just killed a man
I caught him layin' with my girlfriend
An' now they're both dead
People can be so cold when they're dead
