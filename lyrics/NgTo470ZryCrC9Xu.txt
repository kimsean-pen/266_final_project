Hold on tight
I won't go alone
Home tonight
I won't go alone
Cause I don't feel right
Anymore, anymore
Cause I don't feel right
Anymore, anymore
That's okay
You're just the same
That's okay
You're just the same
You said, bury me alive this time
Well I can try, but you're always on my mind
You said, bury me alive this time
Well I can try, but you're always on my mind
Don't let go
I don't wanna be alone
I won't let it show
I don't wanna be alone
Cause I don't feel right
Anymore, anymore
Cause I don't feel right
Anymore, anymore
That's okay
You're just the same
That's okay
You're just the same
You said, bury me alive this time
Well I can try, but you're always on my mind
You said, bury me alive this time
Well I can try, but you're always on my mind
Hold on tight
I won't go alone
Home tonight
I won't go alone
Cause I don't feel right
Anymore, anymore
Cause I don't feel right
Anymore, anymore
You said, bury me alive this time
Well I can try, but you're always on my mind
You said, bury me alive this time
Well I can try, but you're always on my mind
Bury me alive this time
Well I can try, but you're always on my mind
Bury me alive this time
Well I can try, but you're always on my mind
