Well
These are the words that you won't find
This closure is not what you had in mind
Commemorate and relive the harm
The treason
Conclude
Lest we forgive what did bring us there
This closure is not what you had in mind
I try to remember you as it was
Fragments.

Ghost of different shades
Cold day up ahead
I glide away into the dark
Two hours till morning's due
And I wait here for you
To see you rise like the tide
Graced and admired
I fall away across the dark
It will inspire.

Fell inside
Touched upon deadened virtue
Made it burn through weights of courage
Conformed to all those already hidden
Their crystal ground.

Steel made wall
See the barrier stand tall
Ascend through the air and find
A heart yet undefined.

Well
These are the words that you won't find
This closure is not what you had in mind
Commemorate and relive the harm
The treason
Conclude
Lest we forgive what did bring us there
This closure is not what you had in mind
I try to remember you as it was
Fragments.

Source of withering code
Of dust, of deceit
Can't procede without a guide
Intuition abandoned you
I'm clouding the view.

To see you rise like the tide
Graced and admired
I fall away across the dark
It will inspire.

Fell inside
Touched upon deadened virtue
Made it burn through weights of courage
Conformed to all those already hidden
Conformed to all those already hidden
Their crystal ground.
