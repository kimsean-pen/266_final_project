last one turns the lights out, and
makes sure every curtain's drawn
nails the shutters shut, he's sure
we are not of this world for long
who do you think you are?
did you figure out the date?
what do you hope to do
while you sit around and wait, wait, wait?

last one turns the lights out, and
disconnects the answer phone
stuffs all sense of mission, says
"I just can't turn the tide alone"
who do you think you are?
did you figure out the time?
what do you hope to do
while you hide out and whine, whine, whine...

don't go shuttin' down
'til the trumpet sounds
and the battle is won
don't go punchin' out
'til the final shout
and the Father says,
"Well done"

last one turns the light out, and
just keeps playing dumb
these were his instructions, he's
not sure where he got 'em from
why do you wanna hide
in a separate class?
why do you buy the lie
of faith under glass, glass, glass...

don't go shuttin' down...

last one shoots the light sout, and
climbs up to the top of the roof
he's sitting there 'til the Second Coming
says he's got mathematical proof
who do you think you are?
did you figure out the date?
what do you hope to do
while you sit around and wait, wait, wait...

don't go shuttin' down...
