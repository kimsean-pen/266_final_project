Right there's the high school where we met
We sneak out back for a couple of kisses and a cigarette
And that parking lot was our first date
And her momma slammed the door when I dropped her off too late

She's gone
Chasing that highway wind
She's gone
She aint coming back again

This aint nothing
Nothing but a goodbye town
The streets are only bring me down
Gotta find a way to finally get out
Out of this goodbye town

We sat down on those courthouse steps
Fourth of july those fireworks over our heads
And they'd ring the bells of that little church
No there aint no where that I can look that doesn't hurt

She's gone
But I still feel her on my skin
She's gone
She aint coming back again

This aint nothing
Nothing but a goodbye town
The streets are only bring me down
Gotta find a way to finally get out
Out of this goodbye town

I can't erase the memories
And I can't burn the whole place down

No this aint nothing
Nothing but a goodbye town
To hell if I'm sticking around
Gotta find a way to finally get out
Out of this goodbye town

Oh yeah
Out of this goodbye town
Im out of this town
So out of this town

Oh oh ohhh oh oh oh ohhhh
Oh oh ohhh oh oh oh ohhh
Oh oh ohhh oh oh oh ohhhh
Oh oh ohhh oh oh oh ohhh

You'll be just a memory
In the back of my mind
You'll be just a memory
Oh
Somewhere in the back of my mind
In the back of my mind
Yeah
Oh you're gonna look back at what we had
You're gonna think of me
You're gonna think of me
When im long gone
Ill be long gone
