Helen of troy was the kind of girl
Who really had it all
Not a care in the world but her head was turned
And forever changed

She said one love is lost
But another is found
So just take the keys and lets just go
Birds fly south

Nothing ventured
Nothing gained
It's all about love
So I'm not to blame
I'm not to blame

She said I've dotted my eyes and I've crossed my teeth
Had time for friends when they needed me
I try to make sense of senseless things
Try to live how I believe

And of course I leave things behind
That I'll regret
But theres time enough for new things yet
For new things yet

When the dust covers the sun
And all you hope for is undone
Will you turn and say

Nothing ventured
Nothing gained
It was all for love
So love is to blame
Love is to blame

When the dust covers the sun
And all you hope for is undone
Will you turn and say

Nothing ventured
Nothing gained
It was all for love
So love is to blame
Love is to blame

When the dust covers the sun
And all you hope for is undone
Will you turn and say

Nothing ventured
Nothing gained
It was all for love
So love is to blame
Love is to blame
