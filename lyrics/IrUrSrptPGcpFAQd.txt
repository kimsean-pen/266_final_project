I should be glad to have you back
But this time around, something's turned to black
Your pale body a projection screen
I know every frame, so many times that I've seen -

Will it be like before?
Will it ever be the same?
If we reuse the cels
Would the color start to fade?

It's history that hasn't happened yet
Last time I cried, this time I sweat
And doesn't it seem an awful waste
That all of our cells will get replaced?

Will it be like before?
Will it ever be the same?
If we reuse the cels
Would the color start to fade?

Will it be like before?
Will I lose you again?
If we reuse ourselves
Could there be any other end?

If it's just like before
If I'm losing you again
Still we reuse the cels
