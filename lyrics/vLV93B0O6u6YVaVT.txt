Bet your eyes girl
Be other-worldly
Count your blessings
Seduce a stranger
What's so wrong with being happy?
Kudos to those who see through sickness, yeah

Over and over
And over and over
And over

She woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning
"Don't ever let life pass you by"

I suggest we learn to love ourselves
Before it's made illegal
When will we learn?
(When will we learn?)
When will we change?
(When will we change?)
Just in time to see it all come down

Those left standing
Will make millions
Writing books on the way
It should have been

She woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning, warning
"Don't ever let life pass you by"

Floating in this cosmic jaccuzi
We are like frogs oblivious
To the water starting to boil
No one flinches, we all float face down

When she woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning, warning
"Don't ever let life pass you by, pass you by"
