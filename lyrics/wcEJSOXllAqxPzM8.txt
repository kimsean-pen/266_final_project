Dear your name here
It's been a long time, a very long time
Since I've heard your voice
and I bet she never thought I was
so sorry so.
I've had a hard time, very hard time
seeing less of you.
I never thought you knew.

So can you see
You're seeing less of me darling.
And you're blind to the fact that my
heart stopped beating.
And I'm as good as dead,
And I'm as good as dead,

Dear I forgot your name again
Just picking up where I left off.
This is the part where you leave me.
So sorry so.
I've had a hard time, very hard time
seeing less of you.
I never thought you knew,

So can you see
You're seeing less of me darling.
And you're blind to the fact that my
heart stopped beating.

So can you see
You're seeing less of me darling.
And you're blind to the fact that my
heart stopped beating.
And I'm as good as dead,
And I'm as good as dead,

This is all I have to say.
To say

So can you see
You're seeing less of me darling.
And you're blind to the fact that my.
heart stopped beating,

So can you see
You're seeing less of me darling.
And you're blind to the fact that my
heart stopped beating.
