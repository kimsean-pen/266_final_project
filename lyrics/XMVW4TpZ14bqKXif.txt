Dreams on your face, taking you away
Silence on a silver plate
Got no explanations beyond imagination
How beautiful you are to me

Like an insomniac stares at the ceiling
I look at your face all night
I'm touching your body, I hope that you feel it
And dream about me tonight

I miss you when you sleep
When your eyes are closed
I whisper in your ear
Things I'd never dare to speak
I miss you when you sleep
When you are exposed
I always steal a kiss
'Cause I miss you when you sleep

When you sleep
When you sleep

I can assure you, when it comes to this game
That you'll never know how I play
No intimidation, it's pure adoration
I love you more than yesterday

Like an insomniac stares at the ceiling
I look at your face all night
I'm touching your body, I hope that you feel it
And dream about me tonight

I miss you when you sleep
When your eyes are closed
I whisper in your ear
Things I'd never dare to speak
I miss you when you sleep
When you are exposed
I always steal a kiss
'Cause I miss you when you sleep

Woo
When you sleep

'Cause I miss you when you sleep, when you sleep
I miss you when you sleep, when you sleep
When you sleep, when you sleep
I miss you when you sleep, when you sleep

I miss you when you sleep
When your eyes are closed
I whisper in your ear
Things I never dare to speak
I miss you when you sleep
When you are exposed
I always steal a kiss
'Cause I miss you when you sleep

Woo
When you sleep
When you sleep
