Where The Rain Grows

I never looked higher
Than I could see
Never gave less
Than I have given me
The more you have taken
You turned into fakes
I finally know now
Why, for heavens' sake?

Don't tell me you did not see
that I cried
Don't act so deaf and blind
Don't think that if someone's
made dumb to the core
He would stay like before

So I take my life
Back from where the rain grows
Die to survive
Back from where the rain grows

Now you call me liar
'cause you are just the
"Always-have-right-fools-majority"
I think that if someone
starved at your side
You'd all turn your back
Won't give any dime

Don't tell me you did not see
that I cried
Don't act so deaf and blind
Don't think that if someone's
made sad to the core
He would stay like before

So I take my life
Back from where the rain grows
Die to survive
Back from where the rain grows

So I take my life
Back from where the rain grows
Die to survive
Back from where the rain grows

Don't tell me you did not see
that I cried
Don't act so deaf andDon't think that if someone's
made sad to the core
He would stay like before

So I take my life
Back from where the rain grows
Die to survive
Back from where the rain grows

So I take my life
Back from where the rain grows
Die to survive
Back from where the rain grows

(I take my life)
Back from where the rain grows
(Die to survive)
Back from where the rain grows

(I take my life)
Back from where the rain grows
(Die to survive)
Back from where the rain grows
