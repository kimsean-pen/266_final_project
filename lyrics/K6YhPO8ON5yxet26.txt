In home theaters, still projecting
Undestructing, a voice from the back, yeah
Double features, soft and harder
Wait in silence while planning your attack, yeah

Shining through the hollow today, yeah
Thinking maybe heaven's away
They've shown this on both screens
They've shown this on both screens

In torn seats are film leaders
Lead the charging of armies into war, yeah
Lead the charge of twin teachers
False and feature, picture the euphoria

Flipping through the photos they send ya
Going to 16 and Valencia
They've shown this on both screens
They've shown this on both screens

Teem, teeming with things you may find in the dark
Dust in the light, falling through day after night
Falling with you, photos of you
Ooh

In soft seats are stills projecting
No protecting from voices in the back of ya
Double feature, soft and heartland
Stone the hope, then they slip you through the cracks, yeah

Flipping through the photos they send ya
Going to 16 and Valencia
They've shown this on both screens
They've shown this on both screens
They've shown this on both screens
They've shown this on both screens
