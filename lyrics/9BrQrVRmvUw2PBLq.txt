Beautiful and dirty, dirty, rich, rich, dirty

We got a red light, pornographic dance fight
Systematic
Honey, but we go no money
Our hair is perfect, while we're all getting
Shit wrecked, it's automatic
Honey, but we got no money

Daddy, I'm so sorry, I'm so s-s-sorry, yeah
We just like to party, like to p-p-party, yeah

Bang, bang
We're beautiful and dirty rich
(Dirty, dirty, rich, dirty, dirty, rich, beautiful)
Bang, bang
We're beautiful and dirty rich
(Beautiful and dirty, dirty, rich, rich, bang, bang)

We live a cute life, sound fanatic
Pants tighter than plastic
Honey, but we got no money
We do the dance right, we have got it
Made like ice cream topped with honey
But we got no money

Daddy, I'm so sorry, I'm so s-s-sorry, yeah
We just like to party, like to p-p-party, yeah

Bang, bang
We're beautiful and dirty rich
(Dirty, dirty, rich, dirty, dirty, rich, beautiful)
Bang, bang
We're beautiful and dirty rich
(Beautiful and dirty, dirty, rich, rich, bang, bang)

A bang-bang-bang, bang-bang-bang
Beautiful, dirty, rich
A bang-bang-bang, bang-bang-bang
Beautiful, dirty, rich

Bang, bang
We're beautiful and dirty rich
(Dirty, dirty, rich, dirty, dirty, rich, beautiful)
Bang, bang
We're beautiful and dirty rich
(Beautiful and dirty, dirty, rich, rich, bang, bang)

Bang, bang
