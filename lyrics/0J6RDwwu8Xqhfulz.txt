It's all in frame
familiar faces on my wall
this town is strange
season never change
time is up

The world doesn't stop for anyone
until the sun dissolves
we all disappear
there's nothing to fear
now my love
how does it feel?

It's over, nothing's over
I'll grow up when I'm older
God only knows what I would do
to you
It's over, nothing's over
I'll grow up when I'm older
God only knows what I would do
to you

It's over, nothing's over
I'll grow up when I'm older
God only knows what I would do
to you
It's over, nothing's over
I'll grow up when I'm older
God only knows what I would do
to you

It's over, nothing's over
I'll grow up when I'm older
God only knows what I would do
to you
It's over, nothing's over
I'll grow up when I'm older
God only knows what I would do
to you.
