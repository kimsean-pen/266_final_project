I.

Every angel
That drips
From the faucet
Into the sink
Tumbles down the drain
And deep into the ground

The choirs resound in
Resound in an empty room as
Angels seep into the earth
And no, and no one noticed this coffin heaving
These earthen boards thick with deceiving

And, and it swallowed
Up, up the spirit
In the mire of division
As man, as mankind
Looked on and glutted itself
Upon derision trampled underfoot
The seeping of the soil

As man, as mankind
Looked on and grumbled ever
Louder with the toil of every day and every year
And every century

Lost, lost in thought or thought is lost
On the creeping multitude of heaven
They could never see, never see beyond
And so there was, there was nothing beyond
Beyond to see

One after the next for ever and ever
Stepping over the statues of gods

The statues of gods lying broken
Broken in the streets like tyrants
Yeah

II.

The cynical heart too oft forgot
Its blood in course of veins
As circulated phantoms
Phantoms drain from a spout
To sink to sink
And vigilance betrayed by neglect
But uttered not in defiance
Sleep, the uncloaked sleep of doves in mortality
Drawing down the shade of years
Over the monstrosity

Shutting the lids
And shutting the sight
Bridging the break
The Earth, Earth entire has become a wasteland
A marsh intense, a swamp of flatland
Not so flat as desolate
And deep with poison and regret
I cry aloud as I am pull'd beneath
And a body hangs over the shower rod
Like a towel left out to dry

My cries are the echoes of a long-lost suicide
An angel bleeding out, a dove that has died
An angel bleeding out, an angel bleeding out

My cries are the echoes of a long-lost suicide
An angel bleeding out, a dove that has died
An angel bleeding out, an angel bleeding out

My cries are the echoes of a long-lost suicide
An angel bleeding out, a dove that has died
An angel bleeding out, an angel bleeding out

My cries are the echoes of a long-lost suicide
An angel bleeding out, a dove that has died
An angel bleeding out, an angel bleeding out

My cries are the echoes of a long-lost suicide
An angel bleeding out, a dove that has died
An angel bleeding out, an angel bleeding out

My cries are the echoes of a long-lost suicide
An angel bleeding out, a dove that has died
An angel bleeding out, an angel bleeding out

My cries
