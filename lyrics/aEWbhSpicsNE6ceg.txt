You've got to learn to show a happy face
Although you're full of misery
You mustn't show a trace of sadness
Never look for sympathy

You've got to learn although it's very hard
The way of pocketing your pride
Sometimes face humiliation
While you were burning up inside
Facing reality is often hard to do
When it seems happiness is gone

You've got to learn to hide your tears
And tell your heart life must go on

You've got to learn to leave the table
When love's no longer being served
To show everybody that you're able
To leave without saying a word

You've got to learn to hide your sorrow
And go on living as before
What good is thinking of tomorrow
Who knows what it may have in store

You've got to learn to be much stronger
At times your head must rule your heart

You've got to learn from hard experience
And listen to advice
And sometimes pay the price
And learn to live with a broken heart
