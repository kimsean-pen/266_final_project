There's a whole world
Waiting right there for you
If you'd only see it for what it is
There's a million miles of love for you
If you feel it in every kiss

If you'd only
Still your mind
Then you'd find it's all there
For the taking

All our many, disparate lives
In aching isolation
Too late we realise
Our modern violation

If we'd only still our minds
Then we'd find it's all there for the taking

If we'd only
Still our minds
Then we'd find it's all there
For the taking
