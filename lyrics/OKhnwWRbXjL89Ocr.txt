Oh

I feel these four walls closing in
Face up against the glass
Looking at him
Is this my life I'm wondering
It happened so fast
How do I turn this thing around
Is this the bed I chose to make
It's greener pastures I'm thinking about
Wide open spaces far away

All I want is
The wind in my hair
To face the fear but
Not feel scared

Wild horses
I wanna be like you
Throwing caution to the wind
I'll run free too
Wish I could recklessly love
Like I'm longing to
I wanna run with the wild horses
Run with the wild horses

Aah yeah
Oh oh

I see the girl I wanna be
Riding bareback
Carefree along the shore
If only that someone was me
Jumping headfirst
Headlong without a thought
To act and damn the consequence
How I wish it could be that easy
But fear surrounds me like a fence
I wanna break free

All I want is
The wind in my hair
To face the fear but
Not feel scared

Oh wild horses
I wanna be like you
Throwing caution to the wind
I'll run free too
Wish I could recklessly love
Like I'm longing to
I wanna run with the wild horses
Run with the wild horses

Oh

I wanna run too
Oh
Recklessly abandoning myself before you
I wanna open up my heart
Tell him how I feel

Ooh wild horses
I wanna be like you
Throwing caution to the wind
I'll run free too
Wish I could recklessly love
Like I'm longing to
I wanna run with the wild horses
Run with the wild horses
Run with the wild horses
Oh yeah yeah oh oh
I wanna run with the wild horses
Oh
