I don't wanna be that city boy,
Running timeless streets again
I don't wanna be that city boy,
Stumbling down the streets, my friend

Underneath my skin lives an eagle
Underneath these clouds there's an ego
Underneath my sin lives an eagle
Underneath this, underneath this...
Underneath my skin lives an eagle
Underneath these clouds there's an ego
Underneath my sin lives an eagle
Underneath these clouds there's an ego

I don't wanna be that city boy,
Stumbling down the streets again
I don't wanna be that city boy,
Running timeless streets, my friend

Underneath my skin lives an eagle
Underneath these clouds there's an ego
Underneath my sin lives an eagle
Underneath this, underneath this...
Underneath my skin lives an eagle
Underneath these clouds there's an ego
Underneath my skin lives an eagle
Underneath these clouds there's an ego

You're moving around and heavenly you move in town
You're moving around and heavenly you move in town
And heavenly you move in town

Underneath my skin lives an eagle
Underneath these clouds there's an ego
Underneath my sin lives an eagle
Underneath these clouds there's an ego

Underneath my skin lives an eagle
You're moving around and heavenly you move in town
Underneath my skin lives an eagle
You're moving around and heavenly you move in town
Moving around
Moving around
You're moving around and heavenly you move in town

I don't wanna be that city boy
I don't wanna be that city boy
