Give me your cigarette but not your smoker's cough
I wanna push your buttons but don't wanna turn you off
I wanna be the star and I wanna make it rain
So when I burn out I got ice to cool the pain

That's the problem with people like me
Why make it hard when you could make it easy?
(Take it easy, take-take it easy)
Why work hard when you can take it easy?
(Take it easy, take-take it easy)

Give me your words of wisdom but don't make me take the class
I wanna fly you to the moon but I don't wanna pay for gas
When I stop working you can put me in the trash
Or you can use me again on a date that doesn't crash

That's the problem with people like me
Why make it hard when you could make it easy?
(Take it easy, take-take it easy)
Why work hard when you can take it easy?
(Take it easy, take-take it easy)

That's the problem with people like me
Why work hard when you can take it easy?
(Take it easy, take-take it easy)
That's the problem with people like me
Why make it hard when you could make it easy?
(Take it easy, take-take it easy)
Why work hard when you can take it easy?
(Take it easy, take-take it easy)
Why work hard when you can take it easy?
