Everybody knows that he is gonna steal the show
You better keep it in control or you'll go crazy
Back mask, spinning wax, the record had a heart attack
It made you do the things that drove you crazy

You're the one
You're the one
You're the one, that's making me crazy
I'm in love, but its only temporary

You're the one that keeps me coming
When I'm running out of loving
I can only do it once, they'll call me lazy
Take back this and that
Shut your mouth, my wallet's fat
I'm selling out to make another million

You're the one
You're the one
You're the one that's making me crazy
I'm in love but it's only temporary, temporary

You're the one

You're the one that's making me crazy
I'm in love but its only temporary

It's making me crazy
I'm in love but its only temporary, temporary

Your're the... one
