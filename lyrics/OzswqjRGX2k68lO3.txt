Ooooohhhh...
There was a time when
Broken hearts and Broken Dreams
Or over
There was a place where
Or you could do was
Wish on upon leaf clover
But now is a new time
There is a new place
Where dreams was can't come true
It's started the day
When i left you
Oohh.
I could never love again
The way thati loved you.
Ohh.
I could never cry again, Like i did
When i left you, and when we said goodbye
And i looked in your eyes
Just left me beside my self
Without your heart
I could never love again
Now that we're apart
When i was sorry
It was too late to, turn around
And tell you so
They're was no reason2x
Just the foolish beat of my heart
Ooohhh.
I could never love again
The way that i loved you.
I could never cry again, like i did
When i left you
And when we said goodbye
Or the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself
Without your heart
I could never loved again
now that were apart
Oohh
Can't you see, Im not good nobody
Dont you see
the tears are falling In my face
Since you run away
Hey
Break my heart
Sleeped away
Didn't know i was wrong
Never meant to hurt you
Now your gone
Ooohh
Tototooo.
Ooohh.
I could never love again
Now that we're apart2x
