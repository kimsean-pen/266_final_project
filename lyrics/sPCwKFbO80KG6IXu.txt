Take a breath as you look in the mirror
Suit and tie, lie in your eyes to the shimmer
And you can't look back, no you won't look back

Strike you deal, pay the price
Are you worth it
Make the call, roll the dice
Took the perfect
Now you just can't stop, no you just won't stop

In every step you take, will take you far
So who do you think you are?
Please don't tell me now
I'll never let you let me down, no never never
Oh, working girl

Compromise but your smile is defiant
Try to hide, little lies, keep them quiet up
Never let it show, never let them know

In every step you take, will take you far
Who do you think you are?
Please don't tell me now
I'll never let you let me down, no never never
Oh, working girl
Please don't tell me now
I'll never let you let me down, no never never
Oh, working girl

Can you have it all?
Are you wanted more?
Its so hard, its so hard, for a working girl
Come so far, come so far for a working girl
It's so hard, it's so hard, for a working girl

Please don't tell me now
I'll never let you let me down, no never never
Oh, working girl

Its so hard, its so hard, for a working girl
Come so far, come so far for a working girl
It's so hard, it's so hard, for a working girl
