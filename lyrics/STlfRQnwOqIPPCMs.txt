Imagine a war
which everyone won
Permanent holiday
in endless sun
Peace without wisdom
One steals to achieve
relentlessly
pretending to believe
Attitudes are materialistic
positive or frankly realistic
Which is terrible old-fashioned, isn't it?
Or isn't it?

Dance with me
DJ culture
Let's pretend
Living in a satellite fantasy
waiting for the night to end

Let's pretend
we won a war
like a football match
ten-nil the score
Anything's possible
we're on the same side
or otherwise
on trial for our lives
I've been around the world
for a number of reasons
I've seen it all
the change of seasons
And I, my lord, may I say nothing?

Let's pretend
Living in a satellite fantasy
waiting for the night to end
DJ culture
Dance with me
DJ culture
Let's pretend
Living in a satellite fantasy
wondering who's your friend

Now as a matter of pride
indulge yourself
your every mood
No feast days or fast days
or days of abstinence intrude

Consider for a minute
who you are
what you'd like to change
never mind the scars
Bury the past
Empty the shelf
Decide it's time
to reinvent yourself
Like Liz before Betty
she after Sean
Suddenly you're missing
then you're reborn
And I, my lord, may I say nothing?

DJ culture
Une fois!
DJ culture
Deux fois!
Living in a satellite fantasy
waiting for the night to end
DJ culture
Dance with me
DJ culture
Let's pretend
Living in a satellite fantasy
wondering who's your friend

And I, my lord, may I say nothing?
Living in a satellite fantasy
waiting for the night to end
