Fall into the soils grip
You've failed to realize
Full of questions and regret
For the path you've chose in life
Fall into ungodly fears
Of a fate you can't escape
No place to dry your tears
As your memory starts to fade

Darkness becomes your warmth
Confined and alone
You can never be reborn
Silence is your only home
Darkness now comes to you
No angels to descend
A fear that you surrender to
This is your living end

Exit from this world
Depart your mind
Spoil in cold earth
Without a star to shine
Memories vacate
As your brain dies
No final judgment
Your paradise declined

Fall into the soils grip

Of a fate you can't escape
No place to dry your tears

Darkness becomes your warmth
Confined and alone
You can never be reborn
Silence is your only home
Darkness now comes to you
No angels to descend
A fear that you surrender to
This is your living end

Exit from this world
Depart your mind
Spoil in cold earth
Without a star to shine
