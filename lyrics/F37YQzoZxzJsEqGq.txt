Calculate indecision, can't cradle fear no more
Bear the shame of the incision, all lain cold across the floor
Your heart pounds with precision, a king dies inside his courts
Your heart pounds with precision, a king dies inside these doors

Let it all work out

Mind your tongue, inhibition, for once against the wall
Mistakes of young grown provision, it's harder to let them go
From the office of wisdom, my answers don't hear their calls
Laugh and leave with what you know, but the pain won't subside at all

Let it all work out

Flight of noise, faith in the wise of heart
and the moon protects the moon projects a light on everything we said

Flight of noise, buried in the wise of heart
and as the moon protects, the moon projects a light on everything we said

Work out
Let it all work out
