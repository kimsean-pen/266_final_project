I step on you to sip on fire
I got this feeling that I can't go back
I got this feeling that I can't go back.
I burn my eyes to see the world
I got this feeling that I can't go back
I got this feeling that I can't go back.

It's always you in my bed
And in that bed I saw our dance
I need to sleep with my eyes at someone new
To all the fools within my heart
To all the times I played the part
I can't blame all my mistakes I've made on you!

I step on you to sip on fire
I got this feeling that I can't go back
I got this feeling that I can't go back.
I burn my eyes to see the world
I got this feeling that I can't go back
I got this feeling that I can't go back.

I gave so much to feel your rush
In that rush I want your touch
I need to slip inside the eye
I can't be you
I am called from what you've done
If it gets hard you know I'll run
I will blame all my mistakes I've made on you!

I step on you to sip on fire
I got this feeling that I can't go back
I got this feeling that I can't go back.
I step on you to sip on fire
I got this feeling that I can't go back
I got this feeling that I can't go back.
I burn my eyes to see the world
I got this feeling that I can't go back
I got this feeling that I can't go back.
