With an ivory pipe
And a cummerbund
In the dead of night
On the autobahn
With the long ago
On the radio
And the dreaming moon...
We were young and in love
In a burning town
But the fire went out
I'm alone again now
And I finally know
How cool to be cold
With the dreaming moon
I'll begin again
With another new name
And a whole new life
Full of fortune and fame
But in the 100th year
I'll be right back here
With the dreaming moon
