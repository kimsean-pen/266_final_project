Breathe in
Breathe out
You reached the top of the chain
Inhale
Exhale
You made it 'til the end of days

Every man's a sinner
Every man's a liar
Life's a slow procession
Into the fire

Carry the weight or crush under it
Carry the weight or crush

Every man's a sinner
In the name of the father
History's repeating
Into the fire

Carry the weight or crush under it
Carry the weight or crush

We started wanting
To be ourselves
Until we are no more

Breathe in
Breathe out
You reached the top of the chain
Inhale
Exhale
You made it 'til the end of days

Every man is a leader
Every man is a martyr
Every man is in trouble
Caught in your fire

Carry the weight or crush under it
Carry the weight or crush

We started wanting
To be ourselves
To live our lives
We went too far perhaps
Beyond control
Until we are no more

Breathe in
Breathe out
You reached the top of the chain
Inhale
Exhale
You made it 'til the end of days

Breathe in
Breathe out
You reached the top of the chain
Inhale
Exhale
You made it 'til the end of days

Breathe in
Breathe out
You reached the top of the chain
Inhale
Exhale
You made it 'til the end of days
