Let me start it by telling you something
I think there's one thing you should know
We ain't playin' no games this ain't no playground
It's time to drop your sticks and stones
'Cause I've been chasing dreams since I took my first sleep

And I'm gon' be lil' Bo so contemplate
If you're the sheep
And we gon' make a humble pie
so egos cut a slice and take a piece, hey

So, you see, there's no point in underestimating me
Lock up all your thoughts and throw away the key

No, I don't want to hear it 'cause your, no, it doesn't bother me
Now I'm done with all your negativity
And I'm gonna let it wash all over me
I'll be stronger than your words, baby, I'm harder
My smile lights up the world, I'm flyin' higher

So stand down (don't wanna hear it)
Back it up now (don't wanna hear it)
Stand down (don't wanna hear it)
Back it up, back it up-up now
Stand down (don't wanna hear it)
Back it up now (don't wanna hear it)
Stand down (don't wanna hear it)
Back it up, back it up-up now

(Daddy said, "You get once chance in life.")
(Daddy said, "You get once chance in life")

Come a little bit closer
Let me tell you about a girl you used to know
She ain't waiting for luck, no wishful thinker
She's gonna do it on her own
So, you see, there's no point in underestimating me, to me
Lock up all your thoughts and throw away the key
No, I don't want to hear it 'cause your, no, it doesn't bother me
Now I'm done with all your negativity
And I'm gonna let it wash all over me
I'll be stronger than your words, baby, I'm harder
My smile lights up the world, I'm flyin' higher

So stand down (don't wanna hear it)
Back it up now (don't wanna hear it)
Stand down (don't wanna hear it)
Back it up, back it up-up now
Stand down (don't wanna hear it)
Back it up now (don't wanna hear it)
Stand down (don't wanna hear it)

Back it up, back it up-up now
