Oh, here we go

I feel like fire, I feel like rain
I can take you higher, put your [?] on me

Woo, I'm lit, don't mess with it
Woo, stand back, let me do my shit
Woo, I'm lit, don't mess with it

Hands to the sky, show me that you're mine
Hands to the sky, show me that you're mine
And baby, worship me
Worship me
On your knees
Patiently, quietly, faithfully, worship me

Feel that lightning down in my soul
And if you wanna feel the thunder, baby
Better let me know
Let me know

Woo, I'm lit, don't mess with it
Woo, stand back, let me do my shit
Woo, I'm lit, don't mess with it

Hands to the sky, show me that you're mine
Hands to the sky, show me that you're mine
And baby, worship me
Worship me (uh-huh)
On your knees
Patiently, quietly, faithfully, worship me

Oh, here we go, okay
Stop we [?] roses, posies
Appreciate my poses, they know
I'ma fanfare like the star-spangled
I would say can you see all my angles
'Cause I'm hotter than the, I'm hotter than the stovetop
You can put your kettle on, but I'ma make the thing pop
No, I ain't talkin' 'bout my word, just my work
You can add it all up while I'm beefin' up my purse

Hands to the sky, show me that you're mine
(Make me believe it)
Hands to the sky, show me that you're mine
(Oh, yeah)
And baby, worship me (worship me)
Worship me (get it together, make it feel good)
On your knees
Patiently, quietly, faithfully, worship me
