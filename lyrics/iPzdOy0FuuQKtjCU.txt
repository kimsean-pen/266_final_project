There's a pub on the south side of town
Time stands still while there's still wine around
She's the one in the calico
The one who's always and never alone

Did she let him go?
Or did the four winds blow him away?
Does she even know?
She's the girl with the red balloon

Keep her glass full of cheap champagne
She will tell of a man with no name
Smoke and mirrors have done her in
She's in love and she won't be back again

Did she let him go?
Or did the four winds blow him away?
Does she even know?
She's the girl with the red balloon

So lovely
So lonely
Floating away

Did she let him go?
Or did the four winds blow him away?
Does she even know?
Did she let him go?
Or did the four winds blow him away?
Does she even know?
She's the girl
She's the girl with the red balloon
