Just wake up

Stop living like there is no hope
We know what you're going through, we've been there before
I never thought that I would see you like this all alone covering up yourself

You think that there is no one left
Who can get you out of your mess
But I will be right here until the bitter end

Step back and take a look around
You are the only one that can change where you're at
Just make the best of every moment or you will get left behind

You think that there is no one left
Who can get you out of your mess
But I will be right here until the bitter end

'Cause I am here for you
And you are here for me too
We will be right here until the bitter end

Just get up, my friend
Just get up, my friend
This is your time and you know
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you

Just get up my friend
This is your hope your reason to live
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you

You think that there is no one left
Who can get you out of your mess
But I will be right here until the bitter end

Just get up, my friend
I'll be there for you
Just get up, my friend
I'll be there for you
