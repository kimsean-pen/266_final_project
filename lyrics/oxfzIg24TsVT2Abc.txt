Well you made me weep and you made me moan
When you caused me to leave, child, my happy home.
But someday, baby, you ain't gonna worry my life anymore.
I get satisfaction everywhere I go.
Where I lay my head - that's where I call home.
Whether barren pines, or the mission stare
Take tomorrow's collar and give 'em back the glare.
Bang, bang, bang, bang! Vamanos, vamanos.
Bang, bang, bang! Vamanos, vamanos.

You told everybody in the neighborhood
what a dirty mistreater. That I was no good.
But someday, baby, you ain't gonna worry my life anymore.
Doctor or lawyer, I'll never be.
Life of a drifter - only life for me
You can have your riches, all the gold you saved.
Cause' ain't room for one thing in everybody's grave.
Bang, bang, bang, bang! Vamanos, vamanos!
Bang, bang, bang! Vamanos, vamanos!

If I had money, like Henry Ford
Lord, I'd have me a woman, yeah on every road.
But Someday, baby, you ain't gonna worry my life any more.

Invocation of the dummies, requiem for a head
Cash in at the corner, piles of street cred.
I get satisfaction everywhere I go.
One day baby you'll worry me no more.
Bang, bang, bang, bang! Vamanos, vamanos!
Bang, bang, bang! Vamanos, vamanos!
