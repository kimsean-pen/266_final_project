Well I went over to his house to play
But we didn't do a thing all day
In fact I never even saw a guitar in his hand
Though I saw some people come and go
What they was doing I don't know
But I tell you I don't want to understand

I'm hear to say
I was born to play
Yeah yeah yeah

I saw him later on the street
With his fancy clothes baby look so neat
He must of had about 13 girls in tow
And I saw him later at the club
I said hello, do I know you bub
And at this point I don't want to know

I'm here to say
I want to play
Yeah yeah yeah
I'm hear to say
Yeah yeah yeah
