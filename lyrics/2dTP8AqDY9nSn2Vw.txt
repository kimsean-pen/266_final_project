Worship your body as you walk my way
You're the only one who can make me pray
I fall at your feet, your breath defined
And underneath my skin's an intrinsic shrine
Mm mm

Drink my tears, i'm at your mercy
I love you most, but i'm not worthy
I'll give my soul, sacrifice me
Cause your love is holy
Is holy

I can fight but the devil wins
And i will fall like i sin new sins
Forgive me father i am weak
And it's not forgiveness that i seek
Mm mm

Drink my tears, i'm at your mercy
I love you most, but i'm not worthy
I'll give my soul, sacrifice me
Cause your love is holy
Is holy

I'd rather drown in the ocean
Wither on the shore
Undying devotion, feel you in my core
Veneration, this faith's got me high
Nothing without you, live for you t'ill i die
T'ill i die, t'ill i die, t'ill i die, t'ill i die, t'ill i die oh whoaa

Drink my tears, i'm at your mercy
I love you most, but i'm not worthy
I'll give my soul, sacrifice me
Cause your love is holy
Is holy
Your love is holy
Your love is holy
Your love is holy
Your love is
(your love)
