Don't you know that
Don't you know that

Dreams are there to show you the way
Better take a look inside
Close your eyes find out what they're trying to say
You gotta take a look inside

Only for a minute just to make a start
Imagine what you wanna see
Wake him up the wizard sleeping in your heart
Just imagine what you wanna be

Don't you know that
Dreams come true they do, dreams come true
From all of us to all of you, they do
Don't you know that dreams come true

Love is just a second away
Better take a look inside
Make that magic rule, let the miracle stay
You gotta take a look inside

Only for a minute just to make a start
Imagine what you wanna see
Only for a minute, it's not a fantasy
Just imagine what you wanna be

Don't you know that
Dreams come true, they do, dreams come true, they do
From all of us to all of you, they do
Don't you know that dreams come true
Don't you know that dreams come true

Dreams come true, don't you know that
Dreams come true, dreams come true
Don't you know that dreams come true
From all of us, from all of us to you
Dreams come true, don't you, don't you know that

Dreams come true, they do, dreams come true, they do
From all of us to all of you, they do, dreams come true
Don't you, don't you, don't you know that dreams come true

Dreams come true, dreams come true
Don't you know that, don't you know that
From all of us to all of you, they do
Don't you know that dreams come true
Don't you know that dreams come true
