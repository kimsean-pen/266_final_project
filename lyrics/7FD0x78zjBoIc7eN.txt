It's not suicide or amnesia
Guess I'll kiss and tell, kiss and tell
If you do decide at your leisure
They can weave their spell, weave their spell

All of the angels
Calling us home
We leave tomorrow
We leave everything we own

And I will be sad as I'm leaving
As they take my hand, take my hand
We won't criticize others leaving
We will understand, understand
Yeah

All of the angels
Calling us home
We leave tomorrow
We leave everything we own
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All of the angels
Calling us home
We leave tomorrow
We leave everything we own
Everything we own
Everything we own

Say goodbye to the world and it's false conclusions
Know that time is a wall
And one more illusion
Come alive with the songs
And their live concretions
Leave the keys in the car
We won't go very far

If you realize they are with you
And they're here today, here today
With the secret prize they will give you
It will be ok, be ok
Yeah

All of the angels
Calling us home
We leave tomorrow
We leave everything we own
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All of the angels
Calling us home
We leave tomorrow
We leave everything we own
Everything we own
Everything we own
Everything we own
Everything we own
Everything we own
Everything we own

All of the angels
All of the angels
