I am here
Right here
Where god puts
None asunder
And you
In black dress and black shoe
You do
Invite me under
Go on
Go there
You can
See me aging
Stars turn
Balls burn
Coming kids
Are raging

Death to everyone
Is gonna come
And it makes hosing
Much more fun

Death to everyone
Is gonna come
And it makes hosing
Much more fun

La la la ...

Every terrible thing
Is a relief
Even months on end
Buried in grief
Are easy light times
Which have to end
With the coming
Of your death friend

Death to everyone
Is gonna come
And it makes hosing
Much more fun

Death to everyone
Is gonna come
And it makes hosing
Much more fun

La la la ...

So strap me on
And raise me high
Cause buddy I'm not
Afraid to die
But life is long
And it's tremendous
And we're glad
That you're here with us
And since we know
An end will come
It makes our living
Fun

Death to everyone
Is gonna come
And it makes hosing
Much more fun

Death to everyone
Is gonna come
And it makes hosing
Much more fun

Death to me
And death to you
Tell me what else can we
Do die do
Death to all
And death to each
Our own god-bottle
S'within reach

Death to everyone
Is gonna come
And it makes hosing
Much more fun
