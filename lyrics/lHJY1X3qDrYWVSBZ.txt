Baby we need compromise if we're gonna make it through, vsection:
Push your self a little more boy,
for me you gotta try a little harder,
all I do is for the love of you
show me you're always gonna be there,
no matter what you're always gonna be there,
Here's what you've gotta do,
(Chorus)
I wanna see a backflip, cartwheel,
don't be cuttin' corna's on me,
you gotta give it all that you've got,
I need to see it to believe it, then,
Wanna see a backflip, for real,
show me that you really do feel everything you say that you do
I need to see it to believe it then baby (baby, baby)

Don't bring me your baggage carts,
I've got plenty on my own (my own)
Bring me all your good stuff baby leave the rest at home,
you've got your own philosophy,
wanna hear all that you believe (believe)
but if it ain't about being faithful, then it ain't impressin' me oh oh
