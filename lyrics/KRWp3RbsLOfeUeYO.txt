All the stars are flashing high above the sea
and the party is on fire around you and me
We're gonna burn this disco down before the morning comes
We're gonna burn this disco down before the morning comes
We're gonna burn this disco down before the morning comes
We're gonna burn this disco down before the morning comes

It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good

Before the morning comes
Before the morning comes

There's a full moon glowing red above the sea
and I feel the sudden heat between you and me
We're gonna burn this disco down before the morning comes
We're gonna burn this disco down before the morning comes
We're gonna burn this disco down before the morning comes

(Before the morning comes)

We're gonna burn this disco down before the morning comes
We're gonna burn this disco down before the morning comes
