Just a Monday, thrift shop couch
Bowl of Cheerios, and it's gettin' dark out
Clickin' my remote to an episode
Of Crazy Housewives
And before you know

I see your face on my screen
That ringtone can only mean
Your friends are gone
You're all alone
And you're thinkin' 'bout me

I used to be your "6 a.m
Hey good mornin'
Beautiful, how ya been?"
I used to be a "we just landed

Miss you, you can't stand it
See you this weekend"
Now I'm just a midnight number
Familiar voice
When you start to wonder if you made the wrong choice
So let it ring, let it ring all night long

'Cause I ain't your lonely call
It's been three weeks and two days
And twelve hours, but who's countin'
Ten thousand tears, feels like a year
Lookin' for some peace, and I found it
'Cause boy you said, "Let's take a break"
In the front seat of your Jeep

So if you got more to say
Leave a message at the beep
I used to be your "6 a.m
Hey good mornin'
Beautiful, how ya been?"

I used to be a "we just landed
Miss you, you can't stand it
See you this weekend"
Now I'm just a midnight number
Familiar voice
When you start to wonder if you made the wrong choice

So let it ring, let it ring all night long
'Cause I ain't your lonely call
I ain't your lonely call, call, oh
Uuh uuh uuh
Uuh uuh uuh
Let it ring, (uuh uuh uuh)
let it ring, let it ring, girl

Let it ring, let it ring, (uuh uuh uuh
let it ring, girl
Let it ring, let it ring, (uuh uuh uuh)
let it ring, girl
Let it ring, let it ring, (uuh uuh uuh)
let it ring, girl
Let it ring, let it ring, (uuh uuh uuh)
let it ring, girl
Let it ring

I used to be your "6 a.m
Hey good mornin'
Beautiful, how ya been?"
I used to be a "we just landed

Miss you, you can't stand it
See you this weekend"
Now I'm just a midnight number
Familiar voice

When you start to wonder if you made the wrong choice
So let it ring, let it ring all night long
'Cause I ain't your lonely call
No, I ain't your lonely call
Yeah, yeah, yeah
