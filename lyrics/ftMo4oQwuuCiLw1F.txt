It's murder on the dance floor
You'd better not kill the groove
DJ, gonna burn this god damn house right down

I know I know I know I know I know I know I know
About your kind
And so and so and so and so and so and so and so
I'll have to play

If you think your getting away
I will prove you wrong
I'll take you all the way
Boy, just come along
Hear me when I say
Hey

It's murder on the dance floor
But you'd better not kill the grove
Hey hey
It's murder on the dance floor
But you'd better not steal the moves
DJ, gonna burn this god damn house right down

Oh I know I know I know I know I know I know I know
There may be others
And so and so and so and so and so and so and so
You'll just have to pray

If you think your getting away
I will prove you wrong
I'll take you all the way
Stay another song
I'll blow you all away
Hey

It's murder on the dance floor
But you'd better not kill the groove
Hey hey
It's murder on the dance floor
But you'd better not steal the moves
DJ, gonna turn this house around some how
Murder on the dance floor
But you'd better not kill the groove
Hey hey
Murder on the dance floor
But you'd better not steal the moves
DJ, gonna burn this god damn house right down

Don't think you'll get away
I will prove you wrong
I'll take you all the way
Boy, just come along
Hear me when I say
Hey

It's murder on the dance floor
But you'd better not kill the grove
It's murder on the dance floor
But you'd better not steal the moves
DJ, gonna burn this god damn house right down

It's murder on the dance floor
But you'd better not kill the grove
Hey hey
It's murder on the dance floor
But you'd better not steal the moves
DJ, gonna burn this god damn house right down

It's murder on the dance floor
But you'd better not kill the grove
Hey hey
It's murder on the dance floor
But you'd better not steal the moves
DJ, gonna burn this god damn house right down
