Honey Honey it's no use
Coughin' up half of your soul
Baby Baby all your dreams
Are perfectly under control
Hits Hits Hits
Don't you know that I feel so sorry
For this love that I found
But there's a hatred in you my woman
just can't get rid of me now
Sister Tina don't be shy
Patience is starting to bruise
Better spread
What have you got to prove
