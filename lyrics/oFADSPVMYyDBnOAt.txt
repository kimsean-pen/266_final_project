There's a Red House over yonder
That's where my baby stays
There's a Red House over yonder, baby
That's where my baby stays

Well, I ain't been home to see my baby
In ninety nine and one half days
'Bout time I see her

Wait a minute, something's wrong
The key won't unlock the door
Wait a minute something's wrong, baby
This key won't unlock the door

I got a bad, bad feeling
That my baby don't live here no more

I might as well go on back down
Go back 'cross yonder over the hill
I might as well go back over yonder
Way back over yonder 'cross the hill
That's where I came from

'Cause if my baby don't love me no more
I know her sister will
