Pick it up! Pick it up, yeah! Oh!

This is not the way life is supposed to be lived
You're a joke! You're a sick, sick joke!
The way you claim to love it just makes me sick
You're a joke! You're a sick, sick joke!

Stay sheltered off in your prison
I'm gonna make my own decisions
I'll shout the truth at the top of my lungs
I'll never live like you

I'll never live like you!
I'll never live like you!

You started a war, now!
This is a war, now!
You started a war, now!
So you're getting a war! Yeah!

Will you ever wrap your head around this
Oh! Oh!
Will you ever wrap your head around this

Sin does not define us
Sin will not control us
Sin does not define us
Sin will never control us

Oh!

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

Sin does not define us
Sin will never control us
