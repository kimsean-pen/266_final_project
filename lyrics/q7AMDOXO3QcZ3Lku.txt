Oh, I am guilty
Of feeling one way then the other
I looked the other way when I realized
Maybe I'm broken bread
'Cause where there's bread there's butter
Well, maybe I'm broken bread
When I realize I don't sleep
Yeah, I don't break
So tell me a story
Well, I'm in no hurry
I lay my head down
Against our baby now
Well maybe I've broken bone
But at least we're coming home
We're gonna plant a tree on your birthday
Oh, I can't wait
So tell me a story
Well, I'm in no hurry
I lay my head down
Against our baby now
woah, woah, woah
