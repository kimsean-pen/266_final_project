Angels dancing with a mortal, a sin
A giant born within a woman's womb
Nephilim walking through the forest breaking limbs
As we bow and give respect to the gods

Save yourself
Don't wait on me
My feet are sewn
Endless bottom

The church is burning from the inside out
Altars falling into ashes again
An eagle fly upon horizons
With sight focusing on all our families, and friends

Apologize
Can we rise above it?
Start lying
It's a good endeavor
The ships arrived
Let's sail into the weather
Our crying eyes

Save yourself
Don't wait on me
My feet are sewn
Endless bottom
