Whoa, whoa, going back in time
Whoa, whoa, going back in time

You knew how to start a fire, didn't need gasoline
Never took no time at all to get me on my knees
The fruit just seemed to fall, never had to shake no tree
The door was always open and we didn't need a key

Whoa, whoa

Take me back to those days of gold
We were young and said we'd never get old
No oh, no oh
Take me back to just me and you
Doing things that Momma said don't do
No oh, no oh
Take me back in time
Take me back in time

Didn't I wear a wig, everything's, anything goes
And time and time we'd cross the line
And watch that bomb explode

Whoa, whoa
There it goes, there it goes

Take me back to those days of gold
We were young and said we'd never get old
No oh, no oh
Take me back to just me and you
Doing things that Momma said don't do
No oh, no oh
Take me back in time
Take me back in time
Take me back in time
Take me back in time

Whoa, whoa, going back in time
Whoa, whoa, going back in time

Take me back to those days of gold
We were young and said we'd never get old
No oh, no oh
Take me back to just me and you
Doing things that Momma said don't do
No oh, no oh
Take me back in time
Take me back in time
Take me back in time

Take me back to those days of gold
We were young and said we'd never get old
Take me back in time
Take me back in time
Take me back to just me and you
Doing things that Momma said don't do
Take me back in time

Whoa, whoa, going back in time
