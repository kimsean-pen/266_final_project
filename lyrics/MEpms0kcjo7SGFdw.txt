Is it right that it's your touch that I need to get along
Get along
So give me life
I close my eyes and let you lead me till I'm gone
Till I'm gone
And I said all my life I was high for the good times
I was high for the bad times
Tell me baby that I'll be better I'll be better
There was light on the edge of the dark side
Open doors on the fast life
Tell me baby I'll be better
I'll be better

Open my heart better, open you
Open my heart better
When I fall
You got the medecine to heal my broken bones
Broken bones
When you call
It's like a melody that feels like I'm at home
Like I'm at home
And I said

Open my heart better, open you
Open my heart better
