Can you find me here
In this dark terrain
Can you pull me out
From under

Diamonds in the dirt
Shining through the hurt
Can you pull them out

And hold me close when I'm running away
Say everything we've been wanting to say
Take my sky baby light it up
Oh, take my sky baby light it up

Tonight I'm yours
As the shadows break apart
We show all that we are
Tonight I'm yours
And I'm ready to restart
If you can find my heart in the dark
In the dark

Proof that you can't feel
Show me this is real
Tell me that you are listening

Try to understand
Everything I am
Everything you are

And hold me close when I'm running away
Say everything we've been wanting to say
Take my sky baby light it up
Oh, take my sky baby light it up

Tonight I'm yours
As the shadows break apart
We show all that we are
Tonight I'm yours
And I'm ready to restart
If you can find my heart in the dark
In the dark

Le-let me love you
Le-let me love you down
Ba-baby love me
Ba-baby love me down
Le-let me love you
Le-let me love you down
Ba-baby love me
Baby love me

Tonight I'm yours
As the shadows break apart
We show all that we are
Tonight I'm yours
And I'm ready to restart
If you can find my heart in the dark

Tonight I'm yours
As the shadows break apart
We show all that we are
Tonight I'm yours
And I'm ready to restart
If you can find my heart in the dark
In the dark
In the dark
