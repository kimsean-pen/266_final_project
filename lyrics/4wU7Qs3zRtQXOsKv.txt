Dirty tissues, trust issues
Glasses on the sink, they didn't fix you
Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
Little voices in my head
Secret keeping, stop the bleeding
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
All the souls that I can't listen to, to tell the truth

Lovin' you was young, and wild, and free
Lovin' you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Lovin' you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defences
Lovin' you had consequences

Hesitation, awkward conversation
Runnin' on low expectation
Every siren that I was ignorin'
I'm payin' for it

Lovin' you was young, and wild, and free
Lovin' you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Lovin' you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defences
But lovin' you had consequences

No, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Said no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, mhm

Lovin' you was dumb, dark, and cheap
Lovin' you will still take shots at me
From lovin' you was sunshine, but then it poured
And I lost so much more than my senses
Lovin' you had consequences

Lovin' you
