Madison smiled and she hung with a band of strays
The band was gone
Bringin' it on to the broadway blaze
Once I lived under the city in my sweet July

July mercy on Broadway
Don't you believe it
You better know what I say
She'll make you pay

Down the alleyway, slippin' up a sidestreet
Shine everybody, shine everybody
Everybody, shine everybody

On Broadway, jive and pray
There ain't no mercy now on Broadway

People and the landlords shine
Down and gay wine
In the doom swept the band away
Baby on Broadway

Is she mild like mother and child?
Does she obey?

Once I lived under the city in my sweet July

July mercy on Broadway
Don't you believe it
You better know what I say
She'll make you pay

Black city fair
Ole road runner there
Shine everybody
(Everybody, everybody)
Shine everybody

There'll be no mercy on Broadway
[Incomprehensible]
Mercy on Broadway, mercy on Broadway
Hey!
