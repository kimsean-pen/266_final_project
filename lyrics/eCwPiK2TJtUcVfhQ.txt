A baby cries at The Hacienda
A baby cries at The Hacienda
You know they only stop when they want to, no surrender
Because they only stop when they want to at the Hacienda

Countdown to diabetes at the Hacienda
Countdown to diabetes at the Hacienda
You know they don't even stop when they have to, no surrender
Because they only stop when they want to at The Hacienda

I could write and tell you how I'm all blue
While I'm tangled up in sheets treating women to my pay per view
But then I wonder what good that'll do
There's days I do my cheating with this beautiful L.A. Jew

I needed some romancing so I went and had my ten dollar crew
Now I'm looking at my baby and she's looking like a ten dollar view
And I have tasted pussy, tasted half as sweet, is sweeter than you
It's you

Ooh ooh
No moleste, por favor at The Hacienda
No moleste on the door at The Hacienda
And then he went till she was raw, baby, no surrender
Because they only stop when they want to at The Hacienda

Maybe one day you could send me some nudes
I could agitate myself to the memory of rolling with you
Still I wonder what good that'd do
These days I do my cheating with this beautiful landlady Jew

I needed some romancing so I went and had my ten dollar crew
Now I'm dancing with my baby and she's looking at the ten dollar view
And I ain't missed a pussy like I missed the one that came out of you
It's you

Ooh ooh
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
