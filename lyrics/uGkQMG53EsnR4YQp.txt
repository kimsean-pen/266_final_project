Look at me now
I'm an animal
Look at you now
Are you the hunter or the pray?

The more you strike
The more I feel alive
The less I give
The more you give me back

Pain or pleasure?
When you feel the pressure
Of this violent rapture

For red bullets
Are dancing together
Who's gonna go down?
Who's gonna take the crown?

Watch it now!
If you wanna keep it together
Float like a butterfly and sting like a bee
Yeah yeah
But don't play with fire
Cause we can both get burnt
By an equal desire

Of a flesh and bone treasure

Once we felt the pleasure
Of this violent rapture

Look at me now
I'm an animal
Look at you now
Are you the hunter or the prey?

The more you strike
The more I feel alive
The less I give
The more you give me back

Pain or pleasure?
When you feel the pressure
Of this violent rapture

For red bullets
Are dancing around the ropes
Who's gonna go down?
Who's gonna take the crown?
