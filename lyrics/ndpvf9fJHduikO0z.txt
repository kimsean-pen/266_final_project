Days go by but i don't seem to notice them
Just a roundabout of turns
All these nights I lie awake and on my own
My pale fire hardly burns

Never fell in love with the one who loves me
But with the ones who love me not
Are we doomed to live in grief and misery?
Is it everything we got?

I'm the Mountain
Rising high
It's the way that I survived

I'm the Mountain
Tell my tale
The greatest story's now for sale

I'm the seaside
I'm the waves
I'm the one that makes you crave

I'm the valley
I'm the hills
Look at me I'm standing still

I'm the Mountain
I'm the plain
Tell me now am I insane

I'm the spirit
I'm the source
I'm the root I am the doors

I'm the road
Long and hard
Running out of my heart

I'm the Mountain
Climb me up
And we're never gonna stop

I'm the locker
I'm the key
I am who you want to be

I'm the reason
I'm the blame
I will never be the same

Mirror-mirror tell the truth of the old ones and the youth
Of the things we hide deep from ourselves

Mirror-mirror show me now what will I become and how
For now I'm just a Mountain
I'm the Mountain

Down the road that leads me to the Headley Grange
I see a figure of a young man
He's torn with doubts, mistakes, his selfishness and rage
But doing all the best he can

I'm not so blind to see
That this young man is me
