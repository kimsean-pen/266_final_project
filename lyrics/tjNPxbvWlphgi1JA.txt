Where I come from
You say things will be well and fun
Though the world around you is crumbling
And the truth bleak as a bee
Stay close belive
Though things are not what they seem
I won't let them destroy these dreams

They're just things
Silly little things
They're only things
I think we'll be alright
I think we'll be alright

Where I come from
You say things will be well and fun
Though the world around you is crumbling
And the truth bleak as a bee
Stay close belive
Though things are not what they seem
I wont let them destroy these dreams

They're just things
Silly little things
They're only things
I think we'll be alright
I think we'll be alright
I think we'll be alright
I think we'll be alright
