I want you to know
I tore up my list, I threw it away
Just like everything
How foolish of me
To try and divide people into categories
I found it so easy
But what can I do
When I've got nothing else
Not even myself
I don't know what's left of me

After all that I've done
All the bridges are burned
Would I walk them now anyway
Would I write myself off

Self sabotage to the end
If I could do it again
What would I change?
It was a stupid game anyway
I admit I'm afraid
To face what comes next
Where do I turn when I've turned on my friends?
What if I don't want it?
What if I don't want it?

How arrogant of me
To think anyone could just be
Good or bad
Like cops and robbers
The only one here committing a crime
Was dancing on the line
But what can I say
When it's all that I've known
Got a chance to get better
Do I take it or watch myself suffer

And now that you're gone
All the bridges are burned
Would I walk them now anyway
Would I write myself off

Self sabotage to the end
If I could do it again
What would I change?
It was a stupid game anyway
I admit I'm afraid
To face what comes next
Where do I turn when I've turned on my friends?
What if I don't want it?
What if I don't want it?
Am I kidding myself?
I'm my own biggest villain
What if I don't want it?
What if I don't want it?
Am I kidding myself?
Blaming somebody else
I'm my own biggest villain
I'm my own biggest villain
I'm my
I'm my

Self sabotage to the end
If I could do it again
What would I change?
It was a stupid game anyway
I admit I'm afraid
To change what comes next
Where do I turn when I've turned on my friends?
If I could do it again
What would I change?
It was a stupid game anyway
I admit I'm afraid
To change what comes next
Where do I turn when I've turned on myself?
