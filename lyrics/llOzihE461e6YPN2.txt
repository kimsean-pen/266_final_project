You just want somebody you can blame
One too many times, had to learn from my mistakes
Took my heart now look at what remains
One too many times, had to learn from my mistakes
You just want somebody you can blame
One too many times, had to learn from my mistakes
Took my heart now look at what remains
One too many times, had to learn from my mistakes

Oh baby
You driving me crazy
Don't know who can save me but
Just know I'm not the same me, yeah
Let you go for the both of us
Got a feeling that I'm growing up
Phones blowing up, late night you stay throwing up
With your friends that ain't old enough, goddamn

You gonna hate me when I win a Grammy
Too bad you could never understand me
So cold but I kick it with the family
And you know I'ma never let them near me
You lose and you win I've been learning
Brought out the flame and it's burning
Why did you do me so dirty? Damn

You just want somebody you can blame
One too many times, had to learn from my mistakes
Took my heart now look at what remains
One too many times, had to learn from my mistakes
You just want somebody you can blame
One too many times, had to learn from my mistakes
Took my heart now look at what remains
One too many times, had to learn from my mistakes

Back where we all started
Shoulda knew you were a con artist
Stop calling my phone darling
No blame put it all on me
Stop playing these damn games though
Got you spilling some champagne no
Love lost if I dare say so
That's I'm why laying, laying low

Always stand out I never blend in
No heart I've been feeling like a dead man
And I split like jean Claude Van Damme
Running free in the wild, feeling splendid
Oh how I thought this was destined
Tired of pretending
I learned my lesson
I learned my lesson

You just want somebody you can blame
One too many times, had to learn from my mistakes
Took my heart now look at what remains
One too many times, had to learn from my mistakes
You just want somebody you can blame
One too many times, had to learn from my mistakes
Took my heart now look at what remains
One too many times, had to learn from my mistakes
