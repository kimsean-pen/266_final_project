Tell to myself what goes up
Makeup for myself, I'll never.
Always thought a fire starter.
Then everybody tell you shut up.

Back to this town
doing what you can.
Bound to be gone
Damn I'm a loser.
Damn it but I'll never give up.
But everybody said to "Shut up".

Yeah!

Damned she might care to love up.
Then say she'll never get up.
Everybody said to shut up.
Last time I tell them word up.

Down with the sun
I Knew what i was doing.
Did it to my self
Did it to my self.
And don't expect anything else.
Cause everybody tell me "Shut up".
