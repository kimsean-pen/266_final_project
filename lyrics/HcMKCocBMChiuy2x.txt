Take what you've got
Give it away
Nothing belonged to you in the first place
If they're all us
And we're all them
Then it's like trading between your own hands
I thought I had it figured out, one day it all went missing
I spent the night stuck wide awake, my thoughts all so dissonant
Started thinking maybe I was living wrong
I took my head off for the night, didn't want to believe it
I started spending more time being mindful of my breathing
Sleeping on the floor and feeling so withdrawn
Take what you've got
Give it away
Nothing belonged to you in the first place
If they're all us
And we're all them
Then it's like trading between your own hands
Since I was young I have been told how I should measure success
"Work hard and you can have a life of luxury and excess"
I was walking by when I tripped and fell
Maybe it doesn't matter if I give you all you give me
I'm wondering if those are both different parts of one thing
Maybe now it's all that it ever was
You and me, thinking it's us and them
Can you see that all the difference is pretend?
You always get higher with someone else
Than if you try to climb up all by yourself
Take what you've got
Give it away
Nothing belonged to you in the first place
If they're all us
And we're all them
Then it's like trading between your own hands
