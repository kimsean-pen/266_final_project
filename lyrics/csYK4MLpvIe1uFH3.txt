I forgot to bring you roses
When you hit the floor
Your nouveau poses

Asking for war
Have you forgot the wall?
I've foreseen it all
We've foreseen it all

Holocaust, you've tasted great fear
How could you just occupy another child's tear?

Don't you all know?
Don't you all care?
Don't you all see how this isn't fair?
Are we all blind?
Do we not see?
Do we not bleed?

Faint cries of lost limbs.
Mimes surrounded by mines.
Without warning signs of the great sacrifice.

Holocaust, you've tasted great fear
How could you just occupy another child's tear?

Don't you all know?
Don't you all care?
Don't you all see how this isn't fair?
Are we all blind?
Do we not see?
Do we not bend to misery?

Of course we all know
Of course we all care
Of course we all see how this isn't fair
We are not blind
Yes, we do see
It's time to end this misery

It's time to go up to bed
No more sipping on our regret
Tuck the kids in without worry
No more running out in a hurry

No more bombs falling over head
No more sirens predicting death
Yes, it's the two-state solution
No more glaring through oblivion

Asking for war
Have you forgot the wall?
I've foreseen it all
We've foreseen it all

Holocaust, you've tasted great fear
How could you just occupy another child's tear?

Don't you all know?
Don't you all care?
Don't you all see how this isn't fair?
Are we all blind?
Do we not see?
Do we not bend to misery?

Of course we all know
Of course we all care
Of course we all see how this isn't fair
We are not blind
Yes, we do see
It's time to end this misery

It's no mystery
It's no mystery
