Here on the stage
The time has come
With the strains of 'Be My Angel', of rock in two four
Time may keep alive that old swan song
That we've been playing forever
'Til the time maybe right to say goodbye
My voice is aching, I'm tongue-tied
And the sounds we are making are so uninspired

Goodnight song, played so wrong
Blame the crowd, they scream so loud, so long

Get some honesty
Take the best of me and then the rest let go
In every situation with it's tireless rage
Step outside the cage and let the real fool show
I should have stayed 'round to break the ice
I thought about it once or twice
But nothing ever changes unless there's some pain
And our
Goodnight song, played so wrong

Blame the crowd, they scream so loud, so long
Goodnight song, played so wrong
Blame the crowd, they scream so loud, so long
