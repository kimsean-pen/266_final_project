I'd cross that desert to be where you are
All the things I do to be close to you
A million miles wouldn't seem that far
I'd go anywhere just to win your heart

But wherever this leads
There's somethin' I need

I need love
The kind that makes you wanna live
The kind that makes you wanna breathe
The kind that makes you feel too much
And I need you to help me find a better way
And I guess you never thought you'd hear me say
"I need love"
I need love, I need love

And when I see you I just lose my mind
You're the everything, I thought I'd never find
Must be an angel watching over me
With a little luck, we're gonna make you mine

'Cause I wanna believe
In all we can be

I need love
The kind that makes you wanna live
The kind that makes you wanna breathe
The kind that makes you feel too much
And I need you to help me find a better way
And I guess you never thought you'd hear me say

And I, I will catch you when you fall
Be the greatest love of all
I promise to be
If you give me all I need, I need

I need love
The kind that makes you wanna live
The kind that makes you wanna breathe
The kind that makes you feel too much

I need you
The one that makes you wanna live
The one that makes you wanna breathe
The one that makes you feel to much
And I need you to help me find a better way
And I guess you never thought you'd hear me say
I need love, I need love 'cuz I need love baby, I need love

I'd cross the desert
I'd cross the desert to be where you are
