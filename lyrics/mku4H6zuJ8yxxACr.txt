The world is on fire and no one can save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I'd never dream that I'd meet somebody like you
I'ld never dream that I'd lose somebody like you

No I don't want to fall in love
(this world is only gonna break your heart)
No I don't want to fall in love
(this world is only gonna break your heart)
With you

What a wicked game to play to make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do to let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say you'll never feel this way
What a wicked thing to do to make me dream of you

And I don't want to fall in love
(this world is only gonna break your heart)
No I don't want to fall in love
(this world is only gonna break your heart)
With you

The world is on fire and no one can save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I'll never dream that I'd love somebody like you
I'll never dream that I'd lose somebody like you

No I don't want to fall in love
(this world is only gonna break your heart)
No I don't want to fall in love
(this world is only gonna break your heart)
With you
No I...
