Jesus we're living for Your Name
And we'll never be ashamed of You
Our praise and all we are today
Take, take, take it all, take, take, take it all

And we'll never be ashamed of You
Our praise and all we are today
Take, take, take it all, take, take, take it all

Searching the world, the lost will be found
In freedom we live, as one we cry out
You carried the cross, You died and rose again
My God, I'll only ever give my all

You sent Your Son from Heaven to Earth
You delivered us all, it's eternally heard
I searched for truth and all I found was You
My God, I'll only ever give my all

Jesus we're living for Your Name
We'll never be ashamed of You
Our praise and all we are today
Take, take, take it all, take, take, take it all

You sent Your Son from Heaven to Earth
You delivered us all, it's eternally heard
I searched for truth and all I found was You
My God, I'll only ever give my all

Jesus we're living for Your Name
We'll never be ashamed of You
Our praise and all we are today
Take, take, take it all, take, take, take it all

Jesus we're living for Your Name
We'll never be ashamed of You
Our praise and all we are today
Take, take, take it all, take, take, take it all

Running to the one who heals the blind
Following the shining light
In Your hands, the power to save the world
My life, Jesus
