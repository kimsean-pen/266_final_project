When all the worst we fear lets fall its weight
When the gyre widens on and when the wave breaks
When St. Peter loses cool and bars the gates
When Atlas acts the maggot, makes his arms shake
When the birds are heard again in their singin'
Once atrocity is hoarse from voicin' shame
And when the earth is trembling on some new beginnin'
With the same sweet shock of when Adam first came

Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
(Lover, be good to me)

Be as you've always been (Lover, be good to me)
Be like the love that discovered the sin (Lover, be good to me)
That freed the first man, would do so again
And, lover, be good to me
(Lover, be good to me)
Be that hopeful feeling when Eden was lost (Lover, be good to me)
It's been deaf to our laughter
Since the master was crossed (Lover, be good to me)
Which side of the wall really suffers that cost?
Oh, lover, be good to me

When the man who gives the order
Is born next time 'round on the boat sent back
When the bodyies starvin' at the boarder
Are on TV givin' people the sack
Oh, when the sea rises to meet us
Oh, when there's nothin' left for you and I to do
Oh, when there's nobody upstairs to receive us
When I have no kind words left, love for you

Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
(Lover, be good to me)

Ah, be love in its disrepute (Lover, be good to me)
Scorches the hillside
And salts every root (Lover, be good to me)
And watches the slowin'
And starvin' of troops
And, lover, be good to me (Lover, be good to me)
Be there and you stare as you stand (Lover, be good to me)
Or be like the rose that you hold in your hand
That will grow bold in a battered and desolate land
Oh, lover, be good to me

Love, won't you be
Love, won't you be
Be as you've always been?
Love, won't you be
Love, won't you be
Be as you've always been?
Love, won't you be
Love, won't you be
Be as you've always been?
Love, won't you be
Love, won't you be
Be as you've always been?
