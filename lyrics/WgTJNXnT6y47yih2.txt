I've hit a wall
I doubt it all, and it's disrupting my time
I shed it all, and yet I still agonize, and hesitate, and ill advised
Nevertheless provoke the same insanity

I play with fire, don't ever let me go
I'm unraveled into my own black hole
Sharp turn, I look into the flame
Let this bridge I torch light my way

Is this already absolute?
Is this already absolute?

These are the heaviest moments
Slow burn, there's no guarantee
These are the heaviest moments
Slow burn, there's no guarantee
Guarantee

Shudder to think
that it's already absolute
Shudder to think
Try not to lose my mind!

Harder to process
Power to possess
Let this bridge I torch light my way

I play with fire, don't ever let me go
I'm unraveled into my own black hole
Sharp turn, I look into the flame
Let this bridge I torch light my way

Fast track to the grave
Where it's getting harder to breathe
Don't ever let me go
Let me go

Is it already absolute?
Are we already there?
Is it already absolute?
I build it up to burn it all down
To tear it all down

Playing with fire, don't let me go
I'm unraveled, losing it all
Playing with fire, don't let me go
I'm unraveled, losing it all.
