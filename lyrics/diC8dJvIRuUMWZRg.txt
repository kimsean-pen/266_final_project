Never give up
Go out fighting
Go out fighting
Go out fighting
Go out fighting
Never give up

When you keep the secrets underneath your thumb
You can hide
Or you can be your own museum and shine
When you tell lies

And in your ears and in your tongue you're deaf and you're done
You can cry
Or you can sing your silent requiem all night
When you go blind

Go out fighting
Go out fighting
Never give up
Go out fighting
Go out fighting
Go out fighting
Go out fighting
Never give up

Everybody knows that feeling
Everybody knows desire
Now we're coming down, down to the wire
Now we're coming down, down to the wire

Never give up fighting
Go out fighting
Go out fighting
Go out fighting
Go out fighting
