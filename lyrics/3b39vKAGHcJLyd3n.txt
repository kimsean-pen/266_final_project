with rocks in my dress
and smoke in my hair
I walked into a lake
to get some sleep down in there

won't you come to comfort me?
won't you come to comfort me?

With minnows in my belly
and deep in my veins
the breath-robbin' lightning
was making diamonds of rain

won't you come to comfort me?
won't you come to comfort me?

dreamed I was born on a mountain on the moon
Where nothing grows or ever rots
I dreamed that I had me a daughter
who was magnificent as a horse

won't you come to comfort me?
won't you come to comfort me?
won't you come to comfort me?
won't you come to comfort me?
won't you come to comfort me?
won't you come to comfort me?
won't you come to comfort me?
won't you come to comfort me?
won't you come to comfort me?
won't you come to comfort me?
won't you come to comfort me?
won't you come?
