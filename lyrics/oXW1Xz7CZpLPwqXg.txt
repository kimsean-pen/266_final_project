And hold me closer, and submit me
To your powers of seduction.
it's not magic, but it feels that way.
And I believe that it was love, atleast something of that sort.
I cant decide what was real, or just made believe.
Like a Dream,
I wont want to find myself alone.
Like a Dream,
I wont want to find myself alone.
And I admit, that I have been preoccupied with material things,
that I wanted but did not need.
And like your touch, your company,
Subtle things reassure me.
What's the point in possession if its empty?
Like a Dream,
I wont want to find myself alone.
Like a Dream,
I wont want to find myself alone.
Sweet Dreams,
giving me false hope,
I was alone when I woke.
You always said that you dont,
look back when you leave.
Still you've been giving me low sweet dreams.
