The love we made drifts away
The love we made drifts away
I am born, you are too
We are one. Thought you knew

Girl make it stop
Can you feel my beating heart?
Can you feel my bleeding heart?
Underneath your linen fabric, lay yourself to rest
Time bends back its strong arms moving, slowly take a breath

The time we made, re-create
The time we made, re-create
We were once so brand new
In my head, I wait for you

Girl make it stop
Can you feel my beating heart?
Can you feel my bleeding heart?
When we're apart can you feel my beating heart?
Can you feel my bleeding heart?
Underneath your linen fabric, lay yourself to rest
Time bends back its strong arms moving, slowly take a breath

Underneath your linen fabric, lay yourself to rest
Time bends back its strong arms moving, slowly take a breath
Mediocre loving ways can make you come undone
Our flower blooming window sill is laying in the sun
Our flower blooming window sill
