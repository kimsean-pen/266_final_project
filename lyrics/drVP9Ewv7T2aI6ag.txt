Some chickens crossed the road
Straying far from the hen
Five reached the side one step below zen
One was a female four were mad men
Who moved on moved on moved on
Joined hands and moved on

Standing in line and falling asleep
Building a fence while we're counting the sheep
We'd let you help out but our projects are too deep
Move on move on move on
Stay awake just move on

You have to understand that when it comes to making music
We meshed the styles of five alive and intertwined and fused it

Life comes from life and through our strife we strove to make the sound true
Compelled to spell it out, (no doubt!) in search of what we must do

Our house was to small so we had to move
The neighbours had much doubts so we had to prove
That our soulful dimensions were true to the groove
We, moved on, moved on, moved on
To our house in the middle of our street

Water the music, plant the seeds in the pot
Music is life flowing through... is it not?
Don't forget your roots, but also don't rot
Move on, move on, move on
Plant the seeds and move on

You have to understand that when it comes to making music
We meshed the styles of five alive and intertwined and fused it
Life comes from life and through our strife we strove to make the sound true
Compelled to spell it out, (no doubt!) in search of what we must do

Don't be afraid,
Let your feelings show
Wear your heart on your sleeve,
And let yourself glow, yeah

Don't be afraid,
Let your feelings show... ow-ow
Wear your heart on your sleeve,
Your heart on you sleeve,
And let yourself glow, yeah

Ooh, la la la
Ooh...

Don't be afraid,
Let your feelings... yeah...
Your heart...
And let yourself glow, yeah

Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid

Ah ah ah, ooh...
