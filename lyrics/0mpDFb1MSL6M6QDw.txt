I would describe it as
A invisible darkness
Casting, a shadow
A blinding black
Guarded, by hope
My soul is kept safe from
The bloody claws

Look the way b'yond
What makes it lets me see
Time after time
For needed misery

My dreams my own
No price for you
I grip them tight and hope for sight

You open my eyes
Wide to see
A moment of clarity
Confusion gone, it's in your hands
Your turn to ask
Why?

Life is like a mystery
With many clues but with few, answers
To tell us what it is
That we, can do to look
For messages, that keep us from the truth

Look the way b'yond
What makes it lets me see
Time after time
For needed misery

My dreams my own
No price for, you
I grip them tight and hope for sight

You open my eyes
Wide to see
A moment, of clarity
Confusion gone, it's in your hands
Your turn to ask
Why?

No God
Why?
