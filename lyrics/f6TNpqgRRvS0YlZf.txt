Day after day Im waiting
Sitting around here poised and ready
Why do I feel so numb?
Hear me now
Still when I feel most lonely
There will be people all around me
Shoveling past my eyes
So I live in my head regrets
Leave them on the floor,
Wrap them in an old black sheet
I'm gonna set it on a blaze
Watch it burn to ash and dust
Looking for a sign,
Karma's coming back for us
I was waiting on you,
Waiting on you
The leap, leap, leap
To walk, to walk down
Leap, leap, leap
For you, for me
Night after night I'm suffering
Months have gone by
It seems like dozens
Why do I feel so numb?
Hear me now
If you're the man you claim to be
Why do you dream
The life I don't need?
Never make a move
Never make a change
I needed, I needed,
I needed to make a shift of faith
Leave them on the floor,
Wrap them in an old black sheet
I'm gonna set it on a blaze
Watch it burn to ash and dust
Looking for a sign,
Karma's coming back for us
I was waiting on you,
Waiting on you
Leap, leap, leap
To walk, to walk down
Leap, leap, leap
For you, for me
