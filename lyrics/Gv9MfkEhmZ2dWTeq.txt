I never asked for this feeling
I never thought I would fall
I never knew how I felt till the day you were gone
I was lost
I never asked for red roses
I wasn't looking for love
Somehow I let my emotions take hold
And guess what?
All at once
I'm in love

Oh
I miss you so much
I long for your love
It scares me
'Cuz my heart gets so weak
That I can't even breathe
How can you take things so easily?
Baby, why aren't you missing me?

Why did I act like you mattered?
It was silly of me to believe
That if I just opened my heart
Things would come naturally
Joke's on me... yeah
I didn't ask for love letters
So why did you give them to me?
How could I let your intentions get over on me?
So in love
So naive
Oh baby

Oh

I miss you so much (Yes...)
I long for your love
It scares me
'Cuz my heart gets so weak
That I can't even breathe

How can you take things so easily?

Baby, why aren't you missing me?
And oh (Oh)
How I hate what you have done
Made me fall so deep in love
God knows You're the only one
I want
That I love
Oh oh baby oh
I miss you so much (Yeah)
I long for your love
It scares me
'Cuz my heart gets so weak (So weak)
That I can't even breathe (Can't even breathe)
How can you take things so easily?
Baby, why aren't you missing me?
Baby, why aren't you missing me?
Ooh
Baby, why aren't you
Miss...
Missing me?
