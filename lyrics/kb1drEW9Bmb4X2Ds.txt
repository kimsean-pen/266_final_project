I've never been any ones prince
I've never been any ones someone
It's all coming true
you woke me from my slumber
You made me so much stronger
but now no one holds hands
no one holds hands anymore
I've never been any ones doll
I've never been of any ones interest
It's all coming true
our porcelain hands will save us.
