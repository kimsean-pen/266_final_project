Pour another glass of her warm smoke
Into the river and let it rest
Till my thoughts get weary, until they float
I feel this room crazy, heart on my floor

Pour another glass of her warm smoke
Until I sleepwalk back home
With the stench of her perfume all on my coat
And yet another morning I wake and I'm alone

Well, I know
Well, I know
But I know
But I know
