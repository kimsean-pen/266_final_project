I'm gonna break your heart and get away with murder (Hey hey hey)
You should've known from the start that it wouldn't last forever (Hey hey hey)
I can't control myself - I feel like someone else
I'm gonna break your heart and get away with murder (Hey hey hey)

There's a mystery inside my head
It was you dripping all in red
Did I hurt you?
Let me make it safe and sound

Can you feel me breathing down your neck?
You're just a perfect little human wreck
But I like you
Enough to destroy you - tear you down

I'm gonna break your heart and get away with murder (Hey hey hey)
You should've known from the start that it wouldn't last forever (Hey hey hey)
I can't control myself - I feel like someone else
I'm gonna break your heart and get away with murder (Hey hey hey)

There's a memory inside my head
It feels like a part of me is dead
I should save you
But I want to watch you drown

There's nothing you could say or do
Words mean nothing when your lips are blue
I love you
Now that you're six feet underground

I'm gonna break your heart and get away with murder (Hey hey hey)
You should've known from the start that it wouldn't last forever (Hey hey hey)
I can't control myself - I feel like someone else
I'm gonna break your heart and get away with murder (Hey hey hey)

(Hey hey)

It's time to spill your guts
And I don't like what I see on the inside
I'm looking at the evidence
This seems like a flawless crime
Did you forget that love was dangerous?
And to feel like I'm, I, I, I...

I'm gonna break your heart and get away with murder (Hey hey hey)
You should've known from the start that it wouldn't last forever (Hey hey hey)
I can't control myself - I feel like someone else
I'm gonna break your heart and get away with murder (Hey hey hey)

Get away with murder
Get away with murder
