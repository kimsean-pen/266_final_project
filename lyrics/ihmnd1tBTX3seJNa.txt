Is it me, is it you
Is it the times that we're living through
Was it hard when I had to leave
That day you seemed to change
We all need someone to guide us
Someone to introduce the show
I needed someone just like you
Someone to let me know
I could loose it all

Well I began to breakdown
Searching overtime
Bring me a pig's heart
And a glass of wine
There was nothing that you could've done
There was nothing that you should've said
We're both still chasing shadows in our heads
It was all too soon

But is it me, is it you
Is it the times that we're going through
Was it hard, did your heart breakdown
Is your mind still in control
There is a violence in love
Some things I'll never understand
So where the bullets missed you out
They hit me and I'm falling down again

Well I began to breakdown
Searching overtime
Bring me a pig's heart
And a glass of wine
There was nothing that you could've done
There was nothing that you should've said
I'm still chasing shadows in my head
It was all too soon

Was it me, was it you
Was it the times that we're living through
On my way to see you again
You were my only friend
I know you needed someone to guide you
And the world you should've owned
I needed someone to guide me
Someone to let me know
I could loose it all
