Now the week is done and everybody's up for some fun
Grab your beer and get your sexy ass in the sun
We are the party people
So raise your fucking glass for your favourite season
Sunshine baby
This is the time when we write the stories that are one of a kind
Let's cherish the time like we just don't care
Every time I touch your body it is love in the air

You are the one I ever wanted
You are the one I ever needed
Take my hand, turn the music on
So get it on 'cause life is what you make it
You are the one I ever wanted
You are the one I ever needed
Take my hand and turn the music on
So get it on, cause life is what you make it

Every time I get that feeling inside
I know my friends are around for a crazy party night
Everything I wish is that tomorrow never comes
Till the sun is rising we will dance to the drums
Sunshine baby
This is the time when we write the stories that are one of a kind
Let's cherish the time like we just don't care
Every time I touch your body it is love in the air

You are the one I ever wanted
You are the one I ever needed
Take my hand and turn the music on
So get it on, 'cause life is what you make it
You are the one I ever wanted
You are the one I ever needed
Take my hand and turn the music on
So get it on, 'cause life is what you make it

This is the time
Loke a treasure in a chest that we keep in our hearts
And tonight, everybody feels alive
We are alive
We are alive
I know that we are alive

You are the one I ever wanted
You are the one I ever needed
You are the one I ever wanted
You are the one I ever needed
Take my hand and turn the music on
So get it on, 'cause life is what you make it
You are the one
You are the one
You are the one
We're getting down, down, down
This is our time tonight
