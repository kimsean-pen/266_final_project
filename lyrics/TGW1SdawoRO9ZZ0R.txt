I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you
And all the loneliness I would go through
But if you want to leave I won't stop you

I've been gone so long, I'm used to feeling alone
I estimated our love, my estimation was wrong
See I never knew, what you were going through
But I just got back I see where you're at

How could you have doubted that I'd ever be distracted by
Any other guy no matter if he ever caught my eye
We just need time, some time to connect
What I'm telling now, I hope you never forget it

I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you
And all the loneliness I would go through
But if you want to leave I won't stop you
'Cause I don't want you if you don't want me
To be the one, the only one you wanna run to
Baby boy, you know I've just begun to
Realize what's important to me
So don't leave, don't leave

Maybe I should've tried to put your needs first
But my priorities were messed up and I know you got hurt
See I never knew what you were going through
But I just got back and now I see where you're at

Think about it take a moment just to rewind
Everything that you'd be leaving, everything that was right
Do you really wanna stand there and tell me goodbye
When I'm saying I still love you?

I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you
And all the loneliness I would go through
But if you want to leave I won't stop you
'Cause I don't want you if you don't want me
To be the one, the only one you wanna run to
Baby boy, you know I've just begun to
Realize what's important to me
So don't leave, don't leave

Lonely days and lonely nights
That's were you'd be without me by your side
Better think twice, baby, oh
This could blow up crazy, you know

I can't keep singing, I'm speaking 'cause it's out of control
I gave you everything, body, mind, heart, and soul
But you keep breakin' me, takin' me to another low
Don't do it baby, don't do it, don't let me go

I don't know
I don't know

I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you
And all the loneliness I would go through
But if you want to leave I won't stop you
'Cause I don't want you if you don't want me
To be the one, the only one you wanna run to
Baby boy, you know I've just begun to
Realize what's important to me
So don't leave, don't leave

Baby boy, don't leave me
