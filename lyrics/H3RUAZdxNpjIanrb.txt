Take the line between us
And hold it close to you
I want us to get together
Like lovers do

Let me kiss away your troubles
The cold and lonely nights
Just take this heart I'm giving
And love is on the rise

(Like lovers do)
Wanna hold you through the night
(Like lovers do)
And when I look into your eyes, hey
(Like lovers do)
Oh, I'm drowning in an ocean of emotion

Feels just like forever
(Like forever)
Since I made love to you
September days of scarlet
(Be together)
April morning dew

Oh, so take the love between us
And hold it close to you
I want us to get together
Like lovers do

(Like lovers do)
Wanna hold you through the night
(Like lovers do)
When I look into your eyes, hey
(Like lovers do)
Oh, I'm drowning in an ocean of emotion

(Like lovers do)
Wanna hold you through the night
(Like lovers do)
When I look into your eyes, hey
(Like lovers do)
Oh, I'm drowning in an ocean of emotion

(Like lovers do)
Wanna hold you through the night
(Like lovers do)
And when I look into your eyes, hey
(Like lovers do)
Oh, I'm drowning in an ocean of emotion

(Like lovers do)
Wanna hold you through the night
(Like lovers do)
And when I look into your eyes, hey
(Like lovers do)
Oh, I'm drowning in an ocean of emotion
Like lovers do
Like lovers do
Like lovers do
