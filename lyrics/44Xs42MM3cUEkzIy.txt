Southbound again I don't know if I'm going or leaving home
Southbound again I don't know if I'm going or leaving home
Boy got to be moving
Seems like the boy is bound to roam

So every single time I roll across the rolling River Tyne
Every single time I roll across the rolling River Tyne
I get the same old feeling
Every time I'm moving down the line

Southbound again last night I felt like crying, like crying
Southbound again last night I felt like crying
Right now I'm sick of living
But I'm going to keep on trying, keep on trying
