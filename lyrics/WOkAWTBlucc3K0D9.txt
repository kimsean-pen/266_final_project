Wait, count the pots of gold
Each and every one
Practice, lay by light
Shines each day and each night
I would never income
Oh whatever you do
There's a hand and it's guiding you

(Chorus)
Yea, said it's about you
Watching over you, I'll keep on
Watching over you, I'll keep on
Watching over you, I'll keep on
Watching over you, I'll keep on
Watching over you, I'll keep on
Watching over you, I'll keep on
Watching over you, I'll keep on
Watching over you

(Verse)
I... I want you looking forward
I'll taste your lips and try
No trouble, it's a terrible one
And we should never part
You never leave my side
Each day we try
Don't remember my hand is dying

(Chorus)
Yea, said it's about you
Watching over you, I'll keep on
Watching over you, I'll keep on
Watching over you, I'll keep on
Watching over you, I'll keep on
Watching over you, I'll keep on
Watching over you, I'll keep on
Watching over you, I'll keep on
Watching over you

Over you

Just keep on watching over you
