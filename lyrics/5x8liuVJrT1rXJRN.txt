It's in your eyes, the love you hide away
You can't disguise the things you feel
The thing you say

If you just call my name
Any time at all, I'll be there

I don't know why, the way you're falling away from me
I can't describe it's how it feels
It's what I see

If you just call my name
Anytime at all, oh anytime at all
Oh anytime at all, I'll be there

I look around, all I see is you
But you gotta tell me that you want me too
Look at me, you're all that I need, it's true

I'm here, just call my name
Anytime at all, I'll be there

I look around, all I see is you
You gotta tell me that you want me too
Look at me, you're all that I need, it's true

I can't disguise
The love I wait for you to share
I can't deny
If you reach out and touch my hand, it's there

Or just call my name anytime at all,
Oh anytime at all, oh anytime at all, I'll be there
