We're in a picture black and white
Who took the light out of my life
When you, gave in
We're playing out of different roles
We should be wanting the same goals
Listening, forgiving

Oh, why can't we communicate
When the main feature is just beginning
In the silent movie there's no talking
You're just an actor
So break into my story
Take it over
Paint me with color

Everybody's speaking, but you don't know what they're saying
You're jus guessing meanings
Interpreting emotion through a window that is broken
We're jus testing feelings

Oh, why can't we communicate
When the main feature is just beginning
In the silent movie there's no talking
You're just an actor
So break into my story
Take it over
Paint me with color

Step into the movie, you can be my leading man
Break into the silence, so your heart can understand
Step into the movie, we could walk along the sand
Let me stand beside you, put your life into my hand

Don't you know you love me, like you never love yourself
Don't you know you love me, like you never love yourself
Don't you know you love me, like you never love yourself
Don't you know you love me, like you never love yourself

In the silent movie there's no talking
You're just an actor
So break into my story
Take it over
Paint me with color

In the silent movie there's no talking
You're just an actor
So break into my story
Take it over
Paint me with color
