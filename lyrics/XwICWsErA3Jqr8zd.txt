Why do I second guess everything I've ever tried?
Nothing real ever happens when I take your advice
I don't wanna show you honesty
It's such a waste
You don't wanna know that side of me
So go away

Why did I fall in line?
It left me blind
I'm feeling useless
I've lost my mind

It's taking over my body, so contagious
It's seeping into my blood and I can taste it
Coursing through my veins
I'm not sane
I lost my direction, I caught the infection again
Caught it again

Why did I let you in, let you win, give you a chance?
Fighting fire with fire till it ignites our skin
I don't wanna show you honesty
I ever done
You don't wanna know that side of me
Replay it whole

Why did I fall in line?
It left me blind
I'm feeling useless
I've lost my mind

It's taking over my body, so contagious
It's seeping into my blood and I can taste it
Coursing through my veins
I'm not sane
I lost my direction, I caught the infection again

I can't take another step
I'm lifeless, out of breath
I've hidden underground
But it found me in the depths
I can't take another step
I'm lifeless, out of breath
I've hidden underground
But it found me in the depths

It's taking over my body, so contagious
It's seeping into my blood and I can taste it
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
It's taking over my body, so contagious
It's seeping into my blood and I can taste it
Coursing through my veins
I'm not sane
I lost my direction, I caught the infection again
