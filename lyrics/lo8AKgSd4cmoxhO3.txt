I've been grindin' my teeth in my sleep and
Each night I try to count all the wolves in sheep's skin
But there's just too many and
No matter what I do
It's clear to me I'm born to lose
I'd complain but who would listen?
It doesn't make a bit of difference

So here's to all the years I've wasted
I never thought I could become this jaded

I'm givin' up, given everything I've ever done has gone so wrong and
I gave it all, gave it everything I've got
But I guess that wasn't enough
I'm letting go, letting all that I've been working for slip through my fingers but
I've gotta say, I've gotten used to feeling useless
Will I ever gather the strength to get through this?

I've been asleep at the wheel for the past three years
And it's too late to wake up
I never thought I'd live to see
My best laid plans crumble right in front of me
Is it my destiny to fail?
I've been at this for years and to no avail
The universe has spoken and it won't rest 'til my spirit's broken
So here's to all the years I've wasted
I never thought I could become this jaded
I'm givin' up, given everything I've ever done has gone so wrong and
I gave it all, gave it everything I've got
But I guess that wasn't enough
I'm letting go, letting all that I've been working for slip through my fingers but
I've gotta say, I've gotten used to feeling useless
Will I ever gather the strength to get through this?

Or will I fall?
I've gotta say, I've gotten used to feeling useless

Will I ever find my place in this world?
Will I ever gather the strength to move on?
(When will I know?)
(I'm givin' up, I've given up everything)
(I'm letting go, I let it go too far)
Will I ever find my place in this world?
Will I ever gather the strength to move on?
(When will I know?)
(I'm givin' up, I've given up everything)
(I'm letting go, I let it go too far)
Will I ever find my place in this world?
Will I ever gather the strength to move on?
