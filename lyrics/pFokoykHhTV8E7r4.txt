Rico
Kenny
High off acid
Fly like Aladdin
On the red carpet
Dressed in high fashion
Rico, "How you doin'?"
Bitch I'm outstandin'
You couldn't get in, so you outside standin'
I could stand still but my diamonds still dancin'
He a hood nigga but I make him a romantic
I'ma go and get the money like I am a addict
Before I went and got a safe, I put it in my attic
Hell nah
I ain't classy
More like sassy
Smokin' out the bowl like the bitch named Sandy
Taste like candy
Hands like Randy
I'm original, that's why these bitches can't stand me
All these rap niggas be like,
"Damn! Where my song at?"
Catch me in the room, I'm smokin' gas, where the fog at
Two-tone
Mix-match
They like, "Where you get that?"
You niggas some pussies, lemme show you where my dogs at
Fuckin' on yo bitch, gotta tell me where her walls at
He gave me his number, but he know I ain't gon' call back
Fall back
If you got a problem we can solve that
We do this often, wake you up like coffee in the mornin'
Money on residuals, so when I sleep it's criminal
I just hopped in the coupe and dropped the top
Even though it was thuderin'
High off acid
Alice in Wonderland
I'ma always go get the ball when you bitches fumble it
Hell nah!
I ain't classy
More like sassy
Smokin' out the bowl like the bitch named Sandy
Taste like candy
Hands like Randy
I'm original, that's why these bitches can't stand me
Hell nah!
I ain't classy
More like sassy
Smokin' out the bowl like the bitch named Sandy
Taste like candy
Hands like Randy
I'm original, that's why you bitches can't stand me
