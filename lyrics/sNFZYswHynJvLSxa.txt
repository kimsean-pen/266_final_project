You're weak and tired
It's always a scent in the air
It seems you're trying
To capture what's not really there
And so, remember
The ones that you used up for gain
You'll live forever
With no side effects of your shame

So run, get a little further away from me
Goodbye, a little bit of fire in your apathy
So burn, every little piece that you take from me
Don't turn your back till there's nothing that's left of me

The thirst has woken
And nobody seems so aware
The fakes and liars
Are newly elected as heirs
Of mine, and render
Your judgements from basements and chairs
Realigned we fester
It's easier or so self aware

So run, get a little further away from me
Goodbye, a little bit of fire in your apathy
So burn, every little piece that you take from me
Don't turn your back till there's nothing that's left of me

Can you feel it going down?
Is it lost to your attention?
Break the seal and drink it down
Until you've lost your apprehension

So run, get a little further away from me
Goodbye, a little bit of fire in your apathy
So burn, every little piece that you take from me
Goodbye, get a little further away from me
