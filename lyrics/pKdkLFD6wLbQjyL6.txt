Wake up in the morning, have a hardy breakfast
Think about the nightmares that I didn't finish
New day, same problems, man it never ends
Everybody wants a piece and they never settle
What I'm giving out, it always seems too little
Give me more, give me more is what they all say

You can't have all of me
My boss, my job, my family
You can't have all of me
I need a little for myself

Paying all these bills, man it's such a chore
By the time I write the check I already owe more
And there's always people taking up my time
I already lost my patience, now I'm gonna lose my mind

You can't have all of me
My boss, my job, my family
You can't have all of me
I need a little for myself
You can't have all of me
My soul, my time, and my money
You can't have all of me
I need a little for myself

Now I'm too thin, there's not left of me
I'm like a skeleton, the vultures picked my bones clean
And all these vampires have got me bleeding out
Well they can't take no more and I just have to go without
And all these obligations, well they just keep coming
Won't be long till I'm all used up, then I got nothing

You can't have all of me
My boss, my job, my family
You can't have all of me
I need a little for myself
You can't have all of me
My soul, my time, and my money
You can't have all of me
I need a little for myself

You can't have all of me
You can't have all of me
