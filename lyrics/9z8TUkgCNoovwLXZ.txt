I'm wasted but I'm fine,
It's messing with my mind.
I'm not thinking straight,
It's getting too late,
But I won't go home...
The friends I don't make,
Cause all of 'em fake,
Better be alone!
Get it, get it, get it, get it,
Right or wrong.
Chronic out-of-stater,
Cause I don't belong (here)
Get it, get it, get it, get it,
Right or wrong...
Get it, get it, get it, get it,
Right or wrong.

I tried to be like them,
To smile like I don't care...
But what If I do? (Hey!)
I'm just looking for love and I know that I'll find it somewhere!
Been spending my days in a way they keep calling unfair.
I fell over and over, again and again,
And I know that I've made 'bout a thousand mistakes,
And a milion more, if it's all that it takes!
Get it, get it, get it, get it,
Right or wrong.
