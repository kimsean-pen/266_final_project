While all the time that I was loving you
You were busy loving yourself
I would stop breathing if you told me to
Now you're busy loving someone else
Eleven years out of my life
Besides the kids, I have nothing to show
Wasted my years, a fool of a wife
I should have left your ass long time ago

Well I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time

'Cause you're not worth my tears
Can't do it
I said I can't do it
You were never worth my tears
Cause you're not worth my tears

I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week

Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet
Eleven years of sacrifice
And you can leave me at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side
I should've left your ass a thousand times

Well I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
Remember what I said
I said all

I'm not gon cry
I'm not gon cry
I'm not gon shed no tears
I'm not gonna cry no more
Not no more time

I know there are no guarantees
In love you take your chances

But somehow it seems unfair to me
Look at the circumstances
Through sickness and health
'Til death do us part
Those were the words that we said from our heart
So now when you say that you're leaving me

I don't get that part

I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet

Eleven years of sacrifice
And you can leave me at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side

I should've left your ass a thousand times

Well I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time
'Cause you were never worth my tears

Well I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time
'Cause you were never worth my tears
Well I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears...
Not I'm not gon to shed no tears
