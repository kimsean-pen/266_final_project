Everything's the same
My own relection's lost in
Staring at the frame
Of who I used to be
Rebuilt to place the blame
On someone else's shoulders
How does it feel?
Oh, God it used to smother me

Head full of mistakes
A cloud of my regrets
A human thought grenade
Don't make me pull the pin
And it blows my mind
Feelings are left behind

Heavy hearts are weighed down
From the inside

Do I even need to question
Where you hide the
Life you give me
The breath you take when leaving
Are you even trying to find me now
Can you tell me where I'm heading
Drowning in the deep end

The cracks I count on these lonely walks home
Have caught my thoughts and seen the bottom of my soul
And the place that I lay my head to sleep
Is sure to catch the rest of me
While I dream of what it feels like to be whole

Heavy hearts are weighed down
From the inside

Do I even need to question
Where you hide the
Life you give me
The breath you take when leaving
Are you even trying to find me now
Can you tell me where I'm heading
Drowning in the deep end

You know it's hard to wake up
Whole in an empty bed
Taking its toll
Sinking me slow instead
Hard to wake up
Whole in an empty bed
Taking its toll
Sinking me slow instead

Do I even need to question
Where you hide the
Life you give me
The breath you take when leaving
Are you even trying to find me now
Can you tell me where I'm heading
Drowning in the deep end

Do I even need to question
Where you hide the
Life you give me
The breath you take when leaving
Are you even trying to find me now
Can you tell me where I'm heading
Drowning in the deep end

Drowning in the deep end
