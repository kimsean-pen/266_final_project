An act of kindness
Is what you showed to me
None more than I can take
Oh, none more than I can take

Kindness
Is what you showed to me
It holds me 'till I ache
Overflow and start to break

Oh I, got a feeling this will shake me down
Oh, I'm kind of hoping this will turn me round

And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day, every day, every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day, every day, every day

An act of kindness
Is what you showed to me
It caught me by surprise
In this town of glass and ice

Kindness,
So many people passed me by
But you warmed me to my core
And you left me wanting more

Oh I, got a feeling this will shake me down
Oh, I'm kind of hoping this will turn me round
Oh I, got a feeling that however small
Oh, I'm kind of hoping this will reach my soul

And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day, every day, every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day, every day, every day

My back's up against the wall
I feel guilty, I feel guilty
And you want nothing in return
I feel guilty, I feel guilty
Oh my back's up against the wall
I feel guilty, I feel guilty
And you want nothing in return
I feel guilty, I feel guilty

And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day, every day, every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day, every day, every day
(Now it follows me everyday)

My back's up against the wall
I feel guilty, I feel guilty
And you want nothing in return
I feel guilty, I feel guilty
