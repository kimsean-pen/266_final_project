How do, how do you do?
My name is you
The flies, they all gather around me
And you too

You can't see anything well
You ask me what size it is, not what I sell
The flies, they all gather around me
And you too

Well, I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone
Well, I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone

But the devil's apprentice, he gave me some credit
He fed me along, and I'll probably regret it
I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone

I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone
Yeah, I don't want you to be alone down there
To be alone down there, to be alone
