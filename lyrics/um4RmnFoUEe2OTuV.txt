Ask me about the man that I've become and I'll let you in on secrets
I'm afraid of everything I've always said I'm not
But the lion's throat that ate my heart says courage is all we've got
So I've kept my head high the best that I could
Eric, I've given all I have to give
It's your job to choose the will to live
That choice is harder the older you get
We have nothing that we need to prove because we've got nothing left to lose
I trust you will be a better man than the one that I pretend to be
That choice is harder the older you get
Ask me about how I've cried out wolf howls
Ask me about how I've cried out wolf howls to moons that aren't there
I am afraid of what I've become
