A real human being
And a real hero

Back against the wall and odds
With the strength of a will and a cause
Your pursuits are called outstanding
You're emotionally complex

Against the grain of dystopic claims
Not the thoughts your actions entertain
And you, have proved, to be

A real human being
And a real hero
A real human being
And a real hero
A real human being
And a real hero
A real human being
And a real hero
A real human being

A pilot on a cold, cold morn' (morning)
155 people on board
All safe and all rescued
From the slowly sinking ship
Water warmer than
His head so cool
In that tight bind knew what to do

And you, have proved, to be
A real human being
And a real hero
A real human being
And a real hero
A real human being
And a real hero
A real human being
And a real hero
A real human being

A real human being

A real human being
