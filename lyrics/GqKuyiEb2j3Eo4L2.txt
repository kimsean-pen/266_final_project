And I don't know better
But I don't know best
I just say whatever
And hold my breath
I'm not all together
I won't find the rest
Lost in the temper
Breakdown, Coalesce
Cause I got a mean bone in my body
If I want then I can
Never mean it when I'm sorry
And I'm sorry for that
Not the life of the party
I lay low, lay low, lay low
But I still got a heartbeat
I know you know, I know
Not the life of the party
I lay low, lay low, lay low
But I still got a heartbeat, ah
Hold it together
And you let me guess
It's hard to remember
What anything meant
You've known me better
When I've been your best
But I can't win forever
You take what you get
Cause you got a mean bone in your body
If you are then I am
Always mean it 'til I'm sorry
But I'm sorry for that
Not the life of the party
I lay low, lay low, lay low
But I still got a heartbeat
I know you know, I know
Not the life of the party
I lay low, lay low, lay low
But I still got a heartbeat, ah
Got gravel embedded in my hands
Caught myself falling for a concrete plan
Throwing stones like confetti
And I'm never really ready for it
Got gravel embedded in my hands
Caught myself falling for a concrete plan
Throwing stones like confetti
And I'm never really ready for it
Not the life of the party
I lay low, lay low, lay low
But I still got a heartbeat
I know you know, I know
Not the life of the party
I lay low, lay low, lay low
But I still got a heartbeat, ah
I lay low, lay low, lay low
I know you know, I know
Got gravel embedded in my hands
Caught myself falling for a concrete plan
Throwing stones like confetti
And I'm never really ready for it
And I'm never really ready for it
