If you want to come on down
Down with your bones so white
And watch while the freight trains pound
Into the wild, wild night

How I would love to gnaw
To gnaw on your bones so white
And watch while the freight trains paw
Into the wild, wild night

How I D-Twain
How I D-Twain

If you want to come on down
Down with your bones so white
And watch while the freight trains pound
Into the wild, wild night
