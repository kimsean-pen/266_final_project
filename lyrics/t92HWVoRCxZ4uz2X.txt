Remember us.
Shedding weight to hear your name.
Playing games, waiting for the day you claim.
Carolina my love, I'm alive.
Carolina your name, the same as mine.
Hear your voice, hear you walking on the floor.
Always pass. Never stopping at the door.
Carolina my love, I'm alive.
Carolina my love, I don't mind.
