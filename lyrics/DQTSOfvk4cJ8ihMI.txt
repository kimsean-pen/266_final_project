Now that i've lost everthing to you
you say you want to start something new
and it's breaking my heart that your leaving
baby i'm grieving
but if you wanna leave take good care
i hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
but than a lot of nice things turn bad out there

oo baby baby it's a wild world
it's hard to get by just upon a smile girl
oo baby baby it's a wild world
i'll always remember you just like a child girl

you know i've seen alot of what the world can do
and it's breaking my heart in two
because i never wanna see you a sad girl
don't be a bad girl
but if you wanna leave take good care
i hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
but just remember there's a lot bad everywhere

oo baby baby it's a wild world
it's hard to get by just upon a smile girl
oo baby baby it's a wild world
i'll always remember you just like a child girl

baby, baby i love you
but you wanna leave take good care
hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
but just remember there's a lot of bad everywhere.

oo baby baby it's a wild world
it's hard to get by just upon a smile girl
oo baby baby it's a wild world
i'll always remember you just like a child girl
