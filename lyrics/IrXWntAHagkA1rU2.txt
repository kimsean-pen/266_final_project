Talk slow
I've been listening all night
And your words, they sound so right
Well I, I know
That you came here with some guy
Tell him go home its you and I
Alright
'Cause I've been thinking about taking the week off
So we can kick it and see where this takes us
Then you say we should just skip the basics
You put your hand on my mouth I don't say shhh
Oh this feels so right
And girl I know just why
It's cause it's you and I
We go where the heart is
And they don't know where we started
So just talk slow
Talk real slow
And just hold on for the time being
And when you're done come and find me
And then they'll know
To talk slow
Well talk slow
We're breathing in the air
And I think we're almost there
Well don't, don't you go
I need you here I swear
As you lead me up the stairs
'Cause I've been thinking about taking the week off
So we can kick it and see where this takes us
They say we should just skip the basics
You put your hand on my mouth I don't say shhh
Oh this feels so right
And girl I know just why
It's cause it's you and I
We go where the heart is
And they don't know where we started
So just talk slow
Talk real slow
And just hold on for the time being
And when you're done come and find me
And then they'll know
To talk slow
We go where the heart is
And they don't know where we started
So just talk slow
Talk real slow
And just hold on for the time being
And when you're done come and find me
And then they'll know
To talk slow
