Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own

Yo! This one here
Goes out to all my players out there man, ya know
That got that one good girl who's always been there man, like

Took all the bullshit
Then one day she can't take it no more and decide to leave...
Yeah
I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Coulda sworn I was dreaming, for her I was feenin
so I had to take a little ride

back tracking over these few years
tryna figure out what I do to make it go bad
'Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashing and I'm so

Can't believe I had a girl like you
and I just let you walk right outta my life
after all I put you through
you still stuck around and stayed by my side

what really hurt me is I broke your heart baby, you were a good girl
And I had no right
I really wanna make things right
'Cause without you in my life girl I'm so

Been all about the world ain't never met a girl
that can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come where you would get up and run
and I would be out chasing you

'Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
than the girl of my dreams that made me be
so happy but now so lonely
