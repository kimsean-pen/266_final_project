Blind, we follow.
Through sickness, through sorrow.
I need you on my side, just give me the chance, just give me the sign!
I said I'd never let you go, but time has played it's role, and this is how it ends.
Uncertain, unprepared, forever in despair.
Alone and I am scared.
Fight on!

Alive!
You cannot leave me on my own, it's no life worth living.
I shouldn't have to do this on my own at the beginning.
We made sacrifices.
We made sacrifices.

Blind, we follow.
Through sickness, through sorrow.
I need you on my side, just give me chance, just give me the sign.
I said I'd never let you go, for once just stay, don't go.
And this is how it ends.
Uncertain, unprepared, forever in despair.
Alone and I am scared.
Live on!

Losing a battle to the game of life,
Love was your downfall.
Finding our solace in the moment, for your heart and for your memory.

As the last bit of breath slowly leaves your lungs.
When the blood seizes within your veins.
I remember the last thing I heard you say.
You say you "feel me in your heart",
Now I feel you in my soul.

We were like stone.
