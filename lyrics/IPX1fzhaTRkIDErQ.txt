What if it's not
If it's not meant to be
What if someone
Has made a mistake

What we've become
There's no turning back
Maybe it's time
To say that out loud

Question marks are falling down
Crushing underneath our memories
As we stand and look around
The world that remained

On the walls we paint our dreams
Hiding in the fallout shelters
While The Gardens of Eden
Are burning above

What if it's not
If it's not meant to be
What if someone
Has made a mistake

What we've become
There's no turning back
Maybe it's time
To say that out loud
