And your gaze still lasting on my brain
Sleeping in on Venezuela trains
I won't be the one to tell you
I can never find the perfect time to say that I won't be the one to tell you
I won't be the one

I won't be the one to tell you
I can never find the perfect line to say that I will be the one to fail you
I will be the one

Mark my words, I hope you understand
If I had my way you'd be my major plan
Mark my words, I hope you understand
If I had my way you'd be my major plan
