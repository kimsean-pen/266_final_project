I'mma gonna raise a fuss, I'mma gonna raise a holler
About workin' all summer just'a tryin' to earn a dollar
Every time I call my baby, try to get a date
My boss says no dice son, you gotta work late
Sometimes I wonder, what I'mma gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
Well my mom and papa told me son, you gotta make some money
If you wanna use the car to go ridin' next Sunday
Well, I didn't go to work told the boss I was sick
uh, you can't use the car 'cuz you didn't work a lick
Sometimes I wonder what I'mma gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
I'm gonna take two weeks gonna have a fine vacation
I'm gonna take my problem to the United Nations
Well, I called my congressman, and he said, quote
I'd like to help you son, but you're too young to vote
Sometimes I wonder what I'mma gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
