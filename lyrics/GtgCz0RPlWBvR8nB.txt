Antique white lace,
A plastic face,
A tinfoil place,
An empty space,
Youre so hung-up on yourself
And nothing else.
(chorus)
I like too much the rain,
The power of my brain,
The sunshine
And the open road,
Ahead of me.
Laughing because,
Its right to laugh,
Dress up at night,

In the right dress.
You cant change me
Into something
That Im not.
(repeat chorus)
Ill hear your line,
Some other time,
When miming
Performance rhyme.
The way you feel,
It is so phoney
And unreal.
(repeat chorus twice)
