Can somebody explain to me
Why everybody is tryna be
Livin' like a celebrity doin' what they see on MTV?
Ice is cool, but I'm looking for more
Simple things is what my heart beats for
'Cause that's me
I don't ask for much
Baby, having you is enough

You ain't got to buy nothin'
It's not what I want
Baby, it's you
We don't have to go nowhere
It's not what I want
Baby, it's you
It's not 'bout what you got, I know you got a lot
No matter what you do, you always give it hot it's you, it's you
Baby, all I want is you, yeah

It don't matter that your car is fly, fly
And your rims are spinnin' on the side, and
It don't matter where we go tonight
'Cause if I'm with you, I'll be alright
That's cool, but I'm lookin' for more
It's your love that my heart beats for
'Cause that's me
Don't have to spend a dime
Baby
I just want your time

You ain't got to buy nothin'
It's not what I want
Baby, it's you
We don't have to go nowhere
It's not what I want
Ooh, baby, it's you
It's not 'bout what you got, I know you got a lot
No matter what you do, you always give it hot it's you, it's you
Baby, all I want is you, yeah

Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You ain't got to buy nothin'
It's not what I want
Baby, it's you
We don't have to go nowhere
It's not what I want
Baby, it's you
It's not 'bout what you got
I know you got a lot
No matter what you do, you always give it hot it's you, it's you
(Baby) baby, all I want is you, yeah
