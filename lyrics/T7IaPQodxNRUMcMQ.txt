Baby I can't remember the last time I pleased you
Baby can you remember me making you feel good?
I watch these guys climb a mountain
Then where does God live? Where do they go?

You can't know, it's not for us to know
You can't know, it's not for us to know

Feeling wild tonight, been listenin' to Surfer Rosa
Feeling like a child tonight, been listenin' to Surfer Rosa

Every once in a while I have this dream where the car won't start
What the fuck does that mean?
(What the fuck does that mean?)
(I don't know)

You can't know, it's not for us to know
You can't know, it's not for us to know

Feeling wild tonight, been listenin' to Surfer Rosa
Feeling like a child tonight, been listenin' to Surfer Rosa

Pick me up at five tonight and take me somewhere nice
Plan out all the stops I'll give you advice
I feel violent tonight
(Pick me up at five tonight I'll take you somewhere nice)
I really want the car to crash
(Plan out all the stops I'll give you advice)

The last time I pleased you
Baby can you remember me making you feel good?
Baby I can't remember the last time I pleased you
Baby can you remember me making you feel-

Feeling wild tonight, been listenin' to Surfer Rosa
Feeling like a child tonight, been listenin' to Surfer Rosa
Feeling wild tonight,
been listenin' to Surfer Rosa (Baby I can't remember)
Feeling like a child tonight,
been listenin' to Surfer Rosa (Baby I can't remember)
