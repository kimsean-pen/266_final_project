You told me, theres no need
to talk it out cause its to late
to proceed and slowly
I took your words and walke away

No looking back
I won't regret, no
I will find my way
I'm broken but still I have to say

It's alright ok
I'm so much better without you
I won't be sorry
Alright Ok
So don't you bother what I do
No matter what you say
I won't return
our bridge has burnt down
I'm stronger now
alright ok
I'm so much better without you
I won't be sorry

You played me, betrayed me
your love was nothing but a game
potrayed a role
you took control
I couldn't help but fall
so deep
but now I see things clear

It's alright ok
I'm so much better without you
I won't be sorry
Alright Ok
So don't you bother what I do
No matter what you say
I won't return
our bridge has burnt down
I'm stronger now
alright ok
I'm so much better without you
I won't be sorry

Don't waste your fiction tears on me
just save them for someone in need
It's way to late
I'm closing the door

It's alright ok
I'm so much better without you
I won't be sorry
Alright Ok
So don't you bother what I do
No matter what you say
I won't return
our bridge has burnt down
I'm stronger now
alright ok
I'm so much better without you
I won't be sorry

It's alright Ok
alright ok
without you
no matter what you say
It's alright ok
alright ok
without you
I won't be sorry
