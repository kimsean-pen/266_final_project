June Haverly, you always get your way
But, June Haverly, not today no not today
You're on top of the world
Just trying to stay on track
And they'll kiss your feet
While they stab your back
And watch your star it burn to blaze and cry
June Haverly, you always got your way
But not today
No not today
No not today
June Haverly, you're not to blame
No not to blame
And, June Haverly don't be ashamed
For all the pain
You're on top of the world
Just trying to stay on track
And they'll kiss your feet
While they stab your back
And watch your star it burn to blaze and cry
June Haverly
We miss you so
Why'd you go
Oh Why'd you go
You're on top of the world
Just trying to stay on track
And they'll kiss your feet
While they stab your back
And watch your star it burn to blaze and cry
June Haverly
We miss you so
Why'd you go
Oh why'd you go
