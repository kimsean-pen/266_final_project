Tell me who to call
Tell me when I'm down
Tell me when I'm out
Tell me if I fall
Tell me if I scream and shout
Will you listen, will you listen?
Tell me if I've broken
When they've got me open
Bleeding on these floors
All my testimonies spoken
And will you listen, will you listen?

Is there anybody out there?
I'm down on my knees, wash myself clean
Is there anybody out there?

Just give me the answers and give me the signs
Just give me the reasons to run in the rain and I'll be alright
Just give me the hope and give the fire
Just give me the reasons to run in the rain and I'll be alright
Yeah, I'll be alright

When the light concedes
Receipts of summer leaves
The melodies resolve
And then the eulogy agrees
Will you listen, will you listen?

And when the dust goes down
And there's nothing, but the ground
And the holy ghost is talking
Will you ever hear the sound?
Will you listen, will you listen?

Just give me the answers and give me the signs
Just give me the reasons to run in the rain and I'll be alright
Just give me the hope and give the fire
Just give me the reasons to run in the rain and I'll be alright

Something come and save me
Come and save me
Something come and save me
Come and save me now
Now something come and save me
Come and save me
Something come and save me
Come and save me and I'll be alright
Yeah, I'll be alright

Just give me the answers and give me the signs
Just give me the reasons to run in the rain and I'll be alright
Just give me the hope and give the fire
Just give me the reasons to run in the rain and I'll be alright

Just give me the answers and give me the signs
Just give me the reasons to run in the rain and I'll be alright
Just give me the hope
Just give me the reasons to run in the rain and I'll be alright
Yeah, I'll be alright
