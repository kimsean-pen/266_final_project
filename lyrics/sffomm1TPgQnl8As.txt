Wake up if you believe
Love is not a fading dream
Tell me I'm not the only one
Who feels this way right now

Lonely needs a friend
Ask him where he's been
You could be the Light that comes
And turns his world around

I don't wanna run, I don't wanna hide
When someone needs somebody
I don't wanna say, I don't got the time
When someone needs somebody
With a little faith and a little soul
We can't go wrong
We can't go wrong

When a heart breaks
And the world shakes
Will we stand for the vision of love?
When a tear falls
And the fear crawls
Will we stand for the vision of love?
Will we stand for the vision of love?

Singing
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Make-up hides her face
Cos she feels out of place
She cries
Come on someone tell this girl she's beautiful
We don't gotta run, we don't gotta hide

When someone needs somebody
We don't need to say, we don't got the time
When someone needs somebody
With a little faith and a little soul
We can't go wrong
We can't go wrong
When a heart breaks
And the world shakes
Will we stand for the vision of love?
When a tear falls
And the fear crawls
Will we stand for the vision of love?
Will we stand for the vision of love?

Singing
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
(C'mon)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Let's stand up
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Let's stand
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Let's stand for the vision
Stand for the vision of love

Wake up
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Wake up
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Wake up if you believe

When a heart breaks
And the world shakes
Will we stand for the vision of love?
Will we stand for the vision of love?
