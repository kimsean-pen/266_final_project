She's under age,
she goes to shows,
she throw her briefs
like all the other girls do.

But when she's safe at home
where no-one can see her,
she light her incense on
and prays to the prisma god.

Crystals and magic stones,
pentagrams and unicorns,
zeta reticuli, affliction buried deep within.

Potions like amphetamin,
nightly visits from her dad
converted into new age cults.
Hail to the prisma age!
