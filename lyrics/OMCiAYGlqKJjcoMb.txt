The sky breaks
Light reaches for me
I'm awake for the first time

It's too late
I'm on the other side

My genesis
This is where it all begins

My genesis
This is where it all begins

The sky breaks
Light reaches for me
The future wakes
Oh, it's calling

My genesis
This is where it all begins
(this is where it all begins) 2x
My genesis
