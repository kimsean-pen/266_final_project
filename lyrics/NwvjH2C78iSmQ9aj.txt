One ray of light

We've been led astray
Fell and made mistakes
Hiding far away from the core
We belittle who we are
Just some restless hearts
Ain't we capable of so much more?

One ray of light
Could change the world tonight
Just you and I
Could change the world tonight
Could change the world tonight
Just you and I
Could change the world tonight

One ray of light
Could change the world tonight
Just you and I
Could change the world tonight

We've been led astray
Fell and made mistakes
Hiding far away from the core
We belittle who we are
Just some restless hearts
Ain't we capable of so much more?

One ray of light
Could change the world tonight
Just you and I
Could change the world tonight
Just you and I
Could change the world tonight

One ray of light
Could change the world tonight
Just you and I
Could change the world tonight
