And you're rushing headlong, you've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong, out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping and there's nothin' you can do about it

Nothin' you can do, no, there's nothin' you can do about it
No, there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can, nothin' you can do about it

And you're rushing headlong, you've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong, out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping, no, there's nothin' you can do about it
Yeah

He used to be a man with a stick in his hand
She used to be a woman with a hot dog stand
Now you've got soup in the laundry bag
Now you've got strings, you're gonna lose your rag
You're gettin' in a fight then it ain't so groovy
When you're screaming in the night, let me out of this cheap 'B' movie

Headlong, down the highway
And you're rushing headlong, out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping and you can't stop rockin'
And there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can, nothin' you can do about it

When a red hot man meets a white-hot lady
Soon the fire starts a raging, gets 'em more than half crazy
Now they start freaking every way you turn
You can't start walking 'cause your feet got burned
It ain't no time to figure wrong from right
'Cause reasons out the window better hold on tight

You're rushing headlong
Headlong, out of control
You think you're so strong
There ain't no stopping and there's nothin' you, nothin' you, nothin' you can do about it at all

Alright, go
And you're rushing headlong, down the highway
And you're rushing headlong, out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping, there's nothin', nothin', nothin' you can do about it, yeah

Headlong
Headlong
Rushing, rushing, rushing, rushing
Rushing, rushing, rushing, rushing
Headlong
Headlong
