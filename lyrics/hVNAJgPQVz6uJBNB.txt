You can't deny incridible
A thousand nights never go away
The passions never go away
The lightning's in our soul to stay

You and I are the reason why
This is holy ground
And you and I are the reason why
Every moment counts

Follow it all, all the way to the alter,
where the love in one
Follow it all, all the way to the heart of
The eternal young
You & I

Follow it all, all the way to the alter,
where the love in one
Follow it all, all the way to the heart of
The eternal young
You & I

You and I are the reason why
This is holy ground
And you and I are the reason why
Every moment counts
You & I

I still hear the summer echo
Across these skies of brilliant indigo
The passions never go away
The fire's in our soul stay

You and I are the reason why
This is holy ground
And you and I are the reason why
Every moment counts

Follow it all, all the way to the alter,
where the love in one
Follow it all, all the way to the heart of
The eternal young
You & I
