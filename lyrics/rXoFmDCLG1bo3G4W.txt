Society failed to tolerate me
And I have failed to tolerate society
Still I can't find what you adore
Inside I hear the echoes of an inner war

Nothing can take the horror from me
Your sick world the loss of all morality
My hate has grown as strong as my confusion
My only hope, my only solution
Is a violent revolution

Violent revolution
Violent revolution
Reason for the people to destroy

I do not need a cause for my rage
I just despise the nature of the human race
When all I see is repulsion and hate
Violence becomes my only friend, my saving grace

When love is lost beyond your control
A pale shadow of lust cannot enlight your soul
So keep your ice cold bitter illusions
I don't need your empty world, my only solution
Is a violent revolution

Violent revolution
Violent revolution
Reason for the people to destroy

Beauty is no more, it's all gone
And utopia will not come
Trust I cannot feel, only pain
And my burning mind has gone insane

Society failed to tolerate me
And I have failed to tolerate society
Still I can't find what you adore
Inside I hear the echoes of an inner war

Nothing can take the horror from me
Your sick world the loss of all morality
My hate has grown as strong as my confusion
My only hope, my only solution
Is a violent revolution

Violent revolution
Violent revolution
Reason for the people to destroy
Violent revolution
Violent revolution
Violent revolution
Reason for the people to destroy
To destroy
To destroy
