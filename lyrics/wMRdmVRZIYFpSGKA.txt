Every brick
And every stone
Of the world we made will come undone if I
(If I can't feel you here with me)
In my sleep
I call your name

But when I wake
Need to touch your face cause I

(I need to feel you here with me)
(You can stop the aching)
(Cause you're the one I need)
I will burn, I will burn for you
With fire and fury
Fire and fury

My heart hurts
My heart hurts for you
Your love burns within me
With fire and fury
If I freeze
You are the flame

You melt my heart
I'm washed in your rain, I know
(You'll always have the best of me)
Destiny's got a hold on me
Guess I never knew love like
Love knows me cause I

(I need to feel you here with me)
I will burn, I will burn for you
With fire and fury

Fire and fury
My heart hurts

My heart hurts for you
Your love burns within me
With fire and fury
Let it all fall down to dust
Can't break the two of us
We are safe in the strength of love

You can stop the aching
Cause you're the one I need

I will burn, I will burn for you
With fire and fury
Fire and fury
My heart hurts
My heart hurts for you
Your love burns within me
It burns! It burns! It burns! It burns!
Your love burns within me
With fire and fury
