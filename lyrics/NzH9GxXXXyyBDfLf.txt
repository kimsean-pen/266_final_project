On a fault line, late night
Underneath the stars we came alive
And singing to the sky just felt right
I won't forget the good times
While the punks started picking fights
With the skater kids under city lights
Remember how we laughed 'til we cried
I won't forget the good times

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times

Bare-knuckled, tight lip
Middle fingers up, ego trip
Devil may care but we didn't mind
I won't forget the good times
We're the boys in black smoking cigarettes
Chasing girls who didn't know love yet
As the bonfire mood came down
I won't forget the good times

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times

When we laughed
When we cried
Those were the days
We owned the night
Wiped away
Lost in time
I found the nerve
To say that

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times
