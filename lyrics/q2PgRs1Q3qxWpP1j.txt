Ginseng
One take
Ya, ya, ya

Tell me that you want
This Novocaine
I don't fuck with niggas
Talking on my name
You turned crazy and still
I'm the one to blame
Told you, bitch, I got no time,
Don't fucking wait
I don't move too fast,
I got these niggas watching me
Trapped myself inside the basement,
Bitch, just try to see, ayy
Last night left the crib so full of shame
I don't got no place to put this pain

I don't let these niggas
On my good side
Want my photo, then,
Bitch, take it of my good side
And my brain be like a
Amotherfucking landslide
Your bitch trifling, now
I'm looking like the bad guy
Can't you see, I do this
Shit because I'm dead
Pinch my leg, I think
I'm dead inside my head
Got these niggas all
Around me just in case
Still you touch me, swear to god,
I'll catch a case
Let me free, damn,
I can't see
Nigga who is she, I don't know
No bitch named Lee
Where's your ID?
Can't fuck you if you sixteen
Don't mean to be mean,
I'm just focused on my green, yeah

Tell me that you
Want this Novocaine
I don't fuck with niggas
Talking on my name
You turned crazy and still
I'm the one to blame
Told you, bitch, I got no time,
Don't fucking wait
I don't move too fast,
I got these niggas watching me
Trapped myself inside the basement,
Bitch, just try to see, ayy
Last night left the crib so full of shame
I don't got no place to put this pain
