Is it done or is it drag?
Waking up stressed, great
Stepping out into a person
Is you about today
Well, the universe it tipped a bit
And left me with half a share
The children love the box again
The animals, right there
And the voices from the past say the future will be kinder
They're living all our memories, some of us need reminding
Glad I didn't stay back in a bitter embrace
There's a fire that needs putting out
With the sun on our faces

Oh, there go the followers
Right under our feet
Come back, we'll be lovers
You're on the wrong side
On the wrong side
On the wrong side

Just tryna bathe on these dusty roads
And watch the day race
Can be untouched out here
Happier than we've ever been
I'm bending it a different way
And all of it's falling in
There's a presence coming up ahead
Let's stop and play a game
You guess which way is back
And I'll guess when we're leaving
There's always a way out
The thing that we make is love
If you can't see that you have it all
Won't hurt to get out

Oh, there go the followers
Right under our feet
Come back, we'll be lovers
You're on the wrong side
On the wrong side
On the wrong side
On the wrong side

There, there go the followers
Right under our feet
Come back, you missed the best part
On the wrong side
On the wrong side
On the wrong side
On the wrong side
I'll be
