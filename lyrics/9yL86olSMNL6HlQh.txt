Standing here helpless
Where do I go if you leave me alone?
Where do I turn now if it don't work out?
As far as I can see, this isn't the way that you said, it would be

Don't leave me like this, don't leave me stranded
If you walk away now, you leave me empty handed
Don't leave me like this, don't leave me stranded
Don't leave me now, don't leave me

Wasn't it you who brought me here to the place lovers go
Just look at these arms reachin' out to you
You said that you'd always care
I just turned around and there's nobody there

Don't leave me like this, don't leave me stranded
If you walk away now, you leave me empty handed
Don't leave me like this, don't leave me stranded
Don't leave me now

You said that you'd always care
I just turned around and there's nobody there

Don't leave me like
Don't leave me like this, don't leave me stranded
If you walk away now, you leave me empty handed
Don't leave me like this, don't leave me stranded, stranded

Don't leave me like this, don't leave me stranded
If you walk away now, you leave me empty handed
Don't leave me like this, don't leave me stranded, stranded
Don't leave me like this, no
Don't leave me like this, yea
Don't leave me, baby
