I feel my heartbeat
When you run your fingers
Through my hair, yeah
I can tell you
I can feel you by my side
When you're not there, yeah
Just as my life fades to darkness
You made me see the light

Showed me that my search is over
I pay the price, I pay the price

Tell you someday
Baby, you and I should be one, one
Through it always

Brighter than the eye can see, we hide the sun
The taste of love is sweet
Like honey on the vine
Like the wind that feeds the fire
Two souls become entwined
Someday, baby you and I should be one, one
So I'm standing 'round this corner
Tall enough to touch
The New York sky, oh yeah
My love is so blind

I just cannot hear
Or see the world go by, oh yeah

Someone can love so completely
One kiss should break the sea

Truth can be stranger than fiction
This love is real, this love is real
I tell you someday
Baby you and I should be one, one
Through it always
Brighter than the eye can see, we hide the sun
Ah, we are one
We are one
We are one
I will follow, count on me

I'll never let you down, oh yeah
My devotion, love you like an ocean
I will surely drown, oh yeah

You'll be my only possession
I'll be a slave to you
We hold the power together

Just me and you
Just me and you
I tell you someday
Baby, you and I should be one, one
Through it always
Brighter than the eye can see, we hide the sun
I tell you someday
Baby, you and I should be one, one
You know my life is in your hands
And every breath you take is planned
And all this love goes on forever
Tell you someday
Baby, you and I should be one, one
Do it always
Baby, you and I should be one, one
Tell you someday
Baby, you and I should be one, one
Do it always
Baby, you and I should be one, one
