Now that the Sun won't shine
Slow down and take your time
Don't lose your mind it's all
Soul destroying lies

I've walked for miles
Past the sacred halls
SACRED HALLS!
My fists have bled
As I smashed the walls
SMASH THE WALLS!
Through this assault,
A voice says halt,
You're not supposed to be here

I saw my grave
I see no future
Am I insane
Woven by the fabrics of the...

Dark roots of the Earth
Echoes an eternity
Dark roots of the Earth
Will see us home eventually

Now that the Sun won't shine
My world was left behind
All mankind was left behind
All mankind will rise and fall
Will anyone survive

Will we be saved
Is there a future left
What will it take
Woven by the fabrics of the...

Dark roots of the Earth
Echoes an eternity
Dark roots of the Earth
Will see us home eventually
That's right!

Now that the Sun won't shine
Slow down and take some time
The sands of time will fall
Left to our demise

You hear the cries
Through the sacred halls
SACRED HALLS!
The people pray
To their god they call
GOD THEY CALL!
To save the Earth for its rebirth
Are we supposed to be here...

I saw my grave
I see no future here
Am I insane
Woven by the fabrics of the...

Dark roots of the Earth
Echoes an eternity
Dark roots of the Earth
Will see us home eventually

Dark roots of the Earth
Echoes an eternity
Dark roots of the Earth
Will see us home eventually
