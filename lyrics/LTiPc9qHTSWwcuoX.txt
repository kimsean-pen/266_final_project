In the garden where the seed was planted deep inside the soil.
Nothing growing for my eyes to see yet
It'll bloom when I'm old
All of them are everblooming
They took the time to grow
Maybe if you took the blame I'd have something to show
And i feel like i can never get away,
Even if you called I'd be getting in the way
And i feel like i was always planted in the shade
Wven though we love the full sun and the rain

See the way that they grow, a shadow is coming after me,
got it out for me
The same loam you've grown
Calling out to me, calling out for me

Watering the soil daily
Life will come around
Maybe i have grown impatient, maybe I just let it drown
And I feel like I can never get away,
Even if you called I would find another way
And I feel like I was always planted in the shade
Even though we love the full sun and the rain

See the way that they grow, a shadow is coming after me,
got it out for me
The same loam you've grown
Calling out to me, calling out for me
Fall in love with me and I don't want to make you
It's all the same to me and I don't want to blame you

You're a work of art, I've seen you crawl out of the shadows
I look better in the dark, sell my shame from the bottom
Your sky is always open
Make me really see it now
I've seen you reach your potential when I'm buried in the ground

See the way that they grow, a shadow is coming after me,
got it out for me
The same loam you've grown
Calling out to me, calling out for me
Fall in love with me and I don't want to make you
It's all the same to me and I don't want to blame you
