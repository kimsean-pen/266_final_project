It's time to kick the habit, I'm coming clean
It's been a hell of a ride but it's all caught up with me
And now I'm off track
Feel like I'm right back where I started
Sat on the kitchen floor all alone talking to a ghost
About where we go when we go
He said, "Life is the great unknown"
Better jump, better run and...

Don't stop now
Though the motion sickness has you spinning out
Cause you're on your way
Oh, my friend, just look how far you've come and
Think twice before you go and throw it all away

Between the peace and panic
I can't break up the static
I need a cleaner frequency
I frequently burn out and vanish
I'm on another planet
There's just no getting through to me

Then I find myself in bed
Lost inside my head again
Running over everything
The voices they are deafening
But out from the noise
I hear that familiar voice
He says "Life is the great unknown"
Better jump, better run, better go
Better jump. Run

Don't stop now
Though the motion sickness has you spinning out
Cause you're on your way
Oh, my friend, just look how far you've come and
Think twice before you go and throw it all away

Cause you're on your way
Cause you're on your way

Cause you're on your way

Don't stop now
Though the motion sickness has you spinning out
Cause you're on your way
Oh, my friend, just look how far you've come and
Think twice before you go and throw it all away

Before you throw it all away
Before you throw it all away
