Tell me which side I'm on
Approaching constant failure
Tell me which side I'm on
(Who is friend or foe?)
Approaching constant failure

Between love and hate
Which path to follow?
How can I keep balance in this race?
Come faith, I'm dying... slowly

In many ways I'm the burden
That divides us from the light
In many ways you're the halo
That keeps my spirit alive

Temptation, play the good or evil part
With me, you evoke the dark... away
Erase the free will, and watch me heal

Tell me which side I'm on
Approaching constant failure

Between love and hate
Which path to follow?
How can I keep balance in this race?
Come faith, I'm dying...

Bemused by trials and tribulations
If I survive, I fly from here
But as the chosen pessimist

(I carve!) Carve my name in stone
(I carve!) Carve my name in stone

Bemused by trials and tribulations
If I survive, I
Fly from here (How can I keep)
But as the chosen pessimist (Balance in this race?)
Come faith, I'm dying...
