Whatever happened to the integrity
Found within a family?

I return your glare
And my bones are chilled
With some sort of sickening
Recipe of fear and anger

Day by day, time after time again
Time after time again

You foster of terror

Bury your diamonds
Destroy your rubies

Take a look around
And notice the black
Drowning our simplicity

We are the constant decay
Each note will disintegrate
Perched upon, upon our towers
Motionless and miserable
Here's to a comfortable

(Casket)

I wish to write, I wish to write
I wish to write a conclusion
