Sunshine, lollipops and rainbows
Everything thats wonderful is what I feel
When we're together.
Brighter than a lucky penny.

When you're here the raindrops disappears
Dear and i feel so fine.
Just to know that you are mine.

My life is sunshine, lollipops and rainbows
Thats how this refrain goes.
So come on Join In. Everybody.

Sunshine, lollipops and rainbows
Everything thats wonderful is sure to come your way
When your in love to stay.
