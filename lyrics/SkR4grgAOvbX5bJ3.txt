And I see on the work you moved on
You out here light and I already got my mind straight
Ain't turning back no more
And I see on the work you moved on
You out here light and I already got my mind straight

Yeah, yeah you did me wrong,
I'm not gonna lie
I've spent nights crying
Sending curses, because of your lies
You misused my innocence
You used it against me
Make it seem like I'm crazy
Baby. baby

Time has passed
I healed my wounds,
I healed my wounds
Reflected and thought about
Your moves
Your moves
You wasn't in a good place
But it's too late
Baby it's too late
To knock on my door again
To knock on my door again
To knock on my door again

And I see on the work you moved on
You out here light and I already got my mind straight
Ain't turning back no more
See on the work you moved on
You out here light and I already got my mind straight
Already got my mind straight
Already got my mind straight

Two months ago I was just tearful
But I'm in a better place
You texting a little late
I'm walking the streets with my head up
Ain't nobody stressing me, texting me
Person to person me
Just walk all the glow off
So please baby boy don't even show off, yeah

You won't get me
I'm over you
You missed your chance
I'm over you

You won't get me
I'm over you
You missed your chance
I'm over you
I'm over you
I'm over you, you, you
I'm over you, you, you, you

Time has passed
I healed my wounds,
I healed my wounds
Reflected and thought about
Your moves
Your moves
You wasn't in a good place
But it's too late
Baby it's too late
To knock on my door again
To knock on my door again
To knock on my door again

And I see on the work you moved on
You out here light and I already got my mind straight
Ain't turning back no more
See on the work you moved on
You out here light and I already got my mind straight
Already got my mind straight
Already got my mind straight
