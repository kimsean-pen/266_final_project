I like the universe
But she messes with my words
I'm not talking planets or galaxies and the distance just makes it worse
I know what you're thinking, this probably sounds rehearsed

So let's give it up for the New Year
Did this party of two have you slightly confused?
Now that our things are divided
She refuses to speak and I'm drifting to sleep at the wheel

Liquids, powders and pills
Not quite taken against my will
The taste tests of girls from all over the world
Who refused to accept my excuses

She put up with so much
Of my madness and my self-abuse
She would tend to my wounds and fill me with food when I'd stumble in drunk for breakfast
She was right to take off before she was consumed

So let's give it up for the New Year

She refuses to speak and I'm drifting to sleep at the wheel

You're totally right, every action was well rehearsed
