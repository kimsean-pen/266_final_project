You came in from the other side
Took your time
Made me feel alive
Why you'd let me go
You never tried
You want to be alone
What did you take of mine?
Was it funny like
You're the other guy passing on by
Every thing you can think
When you are a kid
Funny how we try but you rely
I can make a living selling lies like that
That's the way to go
I never saw that come why'd you do me like that
Do-do-do me like

Oohh ooh oh
Will you take it or leave it?
Will you take it or leave it?
Will you run away when I need it?
Oohh ooh oh
I want to feel it if you mean it
Will you run away when I need it?

Will you take it or leave it?

Don't want me to take the pride
Defended mine
You're my favorite kind
How'd you let me know
what to feel inside
You want to take control
Why did you make me find
all the other sides
I was living with doubt on my mind
Why would you ever change

When you are ok
did you smile when I tell you i'm not

I can make a living selling lies like that

That's a way to go
I never saw it comin why'd you do me like that

Do-do-do me like
Oohh ooh oh
Will you take it or leave it?
Will you take it or leave it?
Will you run away when I need it?

Oohh ooh oh
I'm want to feel it if you mean it
Will you run away when I need it?

Will you take it or leave it?

Oohh ooh oh
Oohh ooh oh
Take it or leave it
Oohh ooh oh (Take it, take it, take it)

Oohh ooh oh (Take it, take it, take it, take it)
Oohh ooh oh
Oohh ooh oh
I can make a living selling lies like that
(Will you take it or leave it?)
Oohh ooh oh
I never saw it comin why'd you do me like that
Oohh ooh oh
Will you take it or leave it?
Oohh ooh oh
Will you take it or leave it?
