Wait, what's going on
I don't remember being so far gone
Wait, where's everyone
Tell me if I'm gonna make it to 21

I am running and running and running away now
I run from the past and the future to stay now
It's all in or nothing and that's how it goes down
And if I get out, I know I'll turn it around

So leave the light on for me
Just leave the light on for me
Just leave the light on for me
Cause I need more time, no I'm not ready to leave

Hey, no looking back
I found the strength that I only thought others had
Hey, and if you ask
I'm loving each moment and living like it's the last

No more running and running and running away now
It's all in or nothing and that's how it goes down

Just leave the light on for me
Just leave the light on for me
Just leave the light on for me
Cause I need more time, no I'm not ready to leave

Oh oh oh oh, oh, oh!
Oh oh oh oh, oh, oh!
Oh oh oh oh, oh, oh!
Cause I need more time, no I'm not ready to leave

So leave the light on for me
Just leave the light on for me

Just leave the light on for me
Just leave the light on for me (Yeah)
Just leave the light on for me
Cause I need more time, no I'm not ready to leave
Just leave the, just leave the, just leave the light on
Just leave the, just leave the, just leave the light on...
Just leave the light on for me
Cause I need more time, no I'm not ready to leave
Cause I need more time to find who I'm supposed to be
