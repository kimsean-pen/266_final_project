Mysterious Vibes, that we share
Mysterious Vibes, that we share
Mysterious Vibes, that we share
God's love, is in the air

I feel the mystery of love
Oh I, feel the mystery of love

Mysterious Vibes, that we share
Mysterious Vibes, that we share
Mysterious Vibes, that we share
God's love, is everywhere

I've found the mystery of love
Oh I've, found the mystery of love

After all the things were said,
the mystery has gone from my head.
I thought that I had worked it out,
now I know what love is about.
If this feeling happens again,
don't be afraid it's not the end
