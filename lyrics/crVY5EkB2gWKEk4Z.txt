Nelson

Out across the heavens
When you're sleeping in your bed,
Someone turns a light on,
Can you feel it burn inside your head?
Floating out your window
On the streams of purest sound,
Can you see the town
In midnight eiderdown
Wrapped in your dressing gown and robed
in space.

Jet Silver and the Dolls of Venus
Span the space between us with a tune
Jet Silver and the Dolls of Venus
Play their music
'Specially for you...

Change your faces slowly
'Til the morning warms the sky
All you see is holy
But to be reborn all has to die...
Children of past summers
We are moving to the end,
Can you wave your hand?
And have you heard the plan?
It's time to tune the band
Play on, play on...

Jet Silver and the Dolls of Venus
Span the space between us with a tune
Jet Silver and the Dolls of Venus
Play their music
'Specially for you...
