Yes, everyone seems to be asleep

Hey look, you didn't even notice
You couldn't even tell
Just when it started happening
Maybe just as well
After all, everything is getting unfamiliar now
Trajectory in decline
And we become obsolete
A frame at a time

I'm locked inside here
I have to stay
With people who aren't here
All the way
Pictures and faces
On display
Of people who aren't here
All the way

And you didn't even notice
And you didn't even notice
That you're missing

Dear world, I can hardly recognize you anymore
And yet I remain certain there is an answer in you
I feel like I have lived so long
Sometimes run out of things to try to do
I can't concentrate
What about...
I begin to go through another that we have been
I have been entirely patient
No, no, not this time

I am leaving because I can't recognize who I have been
You go on spoiling
It's happening
Without me you didn't even notice
Of course it's been happening all along
Permanent intervals
As you become obsolete
Who are you?
Oh, this place...
I can't concentrate
But I know I can't trust myself

I'm locked inside here
I have to stay
With people who aren't here
All the way
Pictures and faces
On display
Of people who aren't here
All the way

Yes, everyone seems to be asleep
