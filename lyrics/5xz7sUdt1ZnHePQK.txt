내 이름을 불러주고
사랑한다 말해줘요
말해주지 않으면
나는 잘 모르겠어요
you are the one that I want babe
all I want is you
I can't see no one but you babe
all I want is you
지금 이 순간만이
내겐 가장 소중해요
어제 그리고 내일은
생각하고 싶지 않아요
you are the one that I want babe
all I want is you
I can't see no one but you babe
All I want is you
All I want is you
I don't want anybody else
hold me tight whisper in my ears
tell me that you love me too
All I want is you
I don't want anybody else
hold me tight whisper in my ears
tell me that you love me
모든 것이 변해가도
내 곁에만 있어줘요
그대만이 소중해요
아무 것도 필요 없어요
you are the one that I want babe
all I want is you
I can't see no one but you babe
All I want is you
All I want is you
I don't want anybody else
hold me tight whisper in my ears
tell me that you love me too
All I want is you
I don't want anybody else
hold me tight whisper in my ears
tell me that you love me
All I want is you
I don't want anybody else
hold me tight whisper in my ears
tell me that you love me
All I want is you
I don't want anybody else
hold me tight whisper in my ears
tell me that you love me
