Maha-hiya
Give it to me one time now
Well, whoa, well

Relax don't do it
When you want to go do it
Relax don't do it
When you want to come
Relax don't do it
When you want to sock it to it
Relax don't do it
When you want to come
When you want to come

Relax don't do it
When you want to go to it
Relax don't do it
When you want to come
Relax don't do it
When you want to sock it to it
Relax don't do it
When you want to come
Come
Whoa-oh-oh

But shoot it in the right direction
Make making it your intention
Live those dreams
Scheme those schemes
Got to hit me (hit me)
Hit me (hit me)
Hit me with those laser beams
Laser beam

(One two)
Relax
Don't do it
Relax
When you want to come (Come)

I'm coming
I'm coming (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Relax (don't do it)
When you want to sock it to it (what's inside me?)
Relax don't do it
When you want to come
Relax don't do it
When you want to sock it to it
Relax don't do it (love!)

When you want to come
When you want to come
When you want to come
Come

Get it up
The scene of love
Oh feel it

Relax don't do it
When you want to go do it
Relax don't do it

Relax don't do it
When you want to sock it to it
Relax don't do it

One time, one time, one time (hey!)
Come!
