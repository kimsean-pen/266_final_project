You came twice last year like a Sears catalog
'Cause your last boyfriend makes love like Boss Hogg
Well now you're seeing me but soon I'll have you seeing God
'Cause girl I'll get you panting like you're Pavlov's dog
Like a DC ten guaranteed to go down
But baby your black box is the one that I found
I'll give you the gift that keeps on givin' it won't cost you any money
Then she grabbed me by the ears and said

Kiss me where it smells funny

So down I go like I'm two thousand flushes
I can tell I'm doing something right by the way that she blushes
She's one that's speechless, I'm the one that's tongue tied
She's thinking,"Holy Mackerel", I'm thinking Tuna on the side!
There must be something wrong with Al Pacino's nose
'Cause the scent of a woman is like rotten tomatoes
Yeah, I'm snorkeling for clams and it doesn't matter if I wanna be
Don't come up for air until you

Kiss me where it smells funny

Drop my face below her waist and stay on third base
I can tell that the cherry's ripe by the way it tastes
Yeah, I could make a lot of wine with the yeast I find inside her panties
And then drink it while I'm eating out down at the seafood shanty
Drop my face below her waist and stay on third base
I can tell that the cherry's ripe by the way it tastes
Yeah, I could make a lot of wine with the yeast I find inside her panties
And then drink it while I'm eating out down at the seafood shanty
Drop my face below her waist and stay on third base
I can tell that the cherry's ripe by the way it tastes
Yeah, I could make a lot of wine with the yeast I find inside her panties
And then drink it while I'm eating out down at the seafood shanty
Drop my face below her waist and stay on third base
I can tell that the cherry's ripe by the way it tastes
Yeah, I could make a lot of wine with the yeast I find inside her panties
And then drink it while I'm eating out down at the seafood shanty
