You are safe with me
Don't worry with the wind chasing the sea
Breathe out Breathe in
Listen to trees cached by the wind
So common give in
There nothing left to win
Ooohh

I know you
Follow the wind too
Step by step
You're deeper into the woods
I'll help you let go
And we'll take it slow
So common give in
You are now your skin
Ooohh

So scream
Cause no one will hear
Cause you are alone, my dear
You won't stay the same, among the trees and the wind
So take my hand and I'll take you home
Ooohh

Ooohh
