Driven by fantasy
How do I get back to it once again
But the dream is all I have

I try to recreate the image in my head
It's all I see
But the flaws are all that's left

All our lives
We just keep searching for what does not exist
When will I
Be willing to finally admit
It's not real

It's tempting to predict the future but it's futile all the same
The past is all we have
And every time I try to replicate the signals in my brain
The flaws are all that's left

All our lives
We just keep searching for what does not exist
When will I
Be willing to finally admit
It's not real

What am I doing?
Why am I trying to forget you?
