Did I jump into love
Didn't know how to land
Now I'm deep into water
Unable to stand
Can I silence the dangers
Be blind to the signs
I see hearts breaking around me
What will happen to mine?

Every now and then
I feel these questions creeping in
But if you leave me in the middle of nowhere
And I can't get back again
Every now and then
All these fears I have begin
Well if you leave me in the middle of winter
Never to see the sun again
Now that I am in
Silent suffering
It's not right
It's not right

Does it feel good to let you

Closer to me
Did I get what I wanted
But not what I need
Can I carry the weight of these secrets and doubts
I know their never spoken
But inside they calling out

Every now and then
I feel these questions creeping in
But if you leave me in the middle of nowhere
And I can't get back again
Every now and then
All these fears I have begin
Well if you leave me in the middle of winter
Never to see the sun again
Now that I am in
Silent suffering
It's not right
It's not right

In the voices
Hard to fight
I'm scared

My heart is saying
It's not right
It's not right
I'm not made to be afraid

Every now and then
I feel these questions creeping in
But if you leave me in the middle of nowhere
And I can't get back again
Every now and then
All these fears I have begin
Well if you leave me in the middle of winter
Never to see the sun again

Every now and then
I feel these questions creeping in
Stuck in the middle of nowhere
And I can't get back again
Now that I am in
Silent suffering
It's not right
It's not right
Oh no it's not right
