Baby girl your beauty got me in a daze
That's my shawty she my little purple haze
I been gone for days twisting up that dank
Breaking down some purple while she sipping drank
Ay, I got lemon in my favourite swisher
Ay, rolling up my weed while she's taking pictures
Ay, got my double cup and it's filled with
Ay, lipstick on the rim that's that druggie love
Even with my blurry vision you look flawless
When we off these drugs girl your my Mia Wallis
Pop another percy when we in the mall
You stumble slurring words I carry you I'll never let you fall
Ay, late night FaceTime its no booty call
Ay, sipping dirty fena please don't drink it all
This your favourite song, shawty grip the bong
Pass out in my bed wake up with breakfast I'll never do you wrong
Baby girl your beauty got me in a daze
That's my shawty she my purple haze
I've been gone for days twisting up that dank
Breaking down some purple while she's sipping drank
Ay, I got lemon in my favourite swisher
Ay, rolling up my weed while she's taking pictures
Ay, got my double cup and it's filled with
Ay, lipstick on the rim that's that druggie love
We got druggie love
You get me high as fuck
We got druggie love
You get me high as fuck
I mean high as fuck
You get me high as fuck
We got druggie love
You get me high as fuck
Baby girl your beauty got me in a daze
That's my shawty she my purple haze
I been gone for days twisting up that dank
Breaking down some purple while she's sipping drank
Ay, I got lemon in my favourite swisher
Ay, rolling up my weed while she's taking pictures
Ay, got my double cup and it's filled with
Ay, lipstick on the rim that's that druggie love
