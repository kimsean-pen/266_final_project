As all my secrets start to show
Spouting reasons not to go my mouth goes cold
You've seen my lies and shame exposed
But I know you know that what we got's no joke

Through all the mud and shit and parasitic cysts
Through all the finger tips scratch scratching at my wrists
Through all the Devil's in disguise
I think I can see a little truth in your eyes

As my secrets start to show
My crippled mouth goes cold
And now you're running away
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back don't wander
Still my mouth, still my mouth goes cold

As all my secrets start to show
Spouting reasons not to go my mouth goes cold
You've seen my lies and shame exposed
But I know you know that what we got's no joke

Through all the fear and doubt, two-faced anxiety
Through all the chemicals bouncing inside my brain
Through all my weakness in disguise
I think I can see a little truth in your eyes

We never saw this coming
But I know we'll keep from drowning
What we got ain't close to nothing
I know we got this, know we got this

When all your doubts surround you
I'll keep us both from drowning
Ain't no two ways about it
I know we got this, know we got this

As all my secrets start to show
Spouting reasons not to go my mouth goes cold
You've seen my lies and shame exposed
But I know you know that what we got's no joke

My mouth goes cold
But I know you know that what we got's no joke
