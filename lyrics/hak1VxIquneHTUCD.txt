She don't run from the sun no more
She boxed her shadow and she won
Said I can see you laugh through these bottle caps
And this wire around my neck ain't there for fun

But someday we'll all be old
And I'll be so damn beautiful

Meanwhile I'll hide my head
Here in this paper bag
'Cause if I can't see you then you can't see me
And it'll be okay
Fly little bee away
To where there's no more rain and I can be me

Yeah, they talk about her
She smiles like she's so tough
She says "Hey, can you talk a little louder?
I don't think my heart is broken enough."

But someday we'll all be old
And I'll be so damn beautiful
Meanwhile I'll hide my head
Here in this paper bag
'Cause if I can't see you then you can't see me
And it'll be okay
Fly little bee away
To where there's no more rain and I can be me"

Some days I wade in the indigo
Singing that song on the radio
I blame these puddles on the rain
You know I gotta keep these cheeks dry today
Gotta keep my cheating strategy
And baby I'm gonna have it made

But someday we'll all be old
And I'll be so damn beautiful
So I'll hide my head
Here in this paper bag
'Cause if I can't see you then you can't see me
And it'll be okay
Fly little bee away
To where there's no more rain and I can be me

And I'll hide my head
Here in this paper bag
'Cause if I can't see you, then you can't see me
And it'll be okay
Fly little bee away
To where there's no more rain and I can be me

Where I can be me . . . yeah
I can be me
Ohh
Where I can be me
