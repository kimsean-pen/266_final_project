I'm not of this world, you're not in this heart
This isn't in me
To open this box you can't shoot the lock
I hide everything so you can't see

Wanna fight? Wanna fuck? Wanna die?
Try your luck, lay down your goddamn arms
Wanna fight? Wanna fuck? Wanna die?
Try your luck, lay down your goddamn arms

There isn't a key you can use on me
There isn't a key so lay down your arms
Arms, arms, arms

You're a book
Every page is written in words I cannot read
So I burn, gotta burn, gotta burn, gotta burn it
So I burn, gotta burn, gotta burn, gotta burn it

Wanna fight? Wanna fuck? Wanna die?
Try your luck, lay down your goddamn arms
Wanna fight? Wanna fuck? Wanna die?
Try your luck, lay down your goddamn arms

There isn't a key you can use on me
There isn't a key so lay down your arms

There isn't a key you can use on me
There isn't a key so lay down your arms

Gotta burn, gotta burn, gotta burn, gotta burn it
Gotta burn, gotta burn, gotta burn, gotta burn it
Gotta burn, gotta burn, gotta burn, gotta burn it
Gotta burn, gotta burn, gotta burn, gotta burn it
