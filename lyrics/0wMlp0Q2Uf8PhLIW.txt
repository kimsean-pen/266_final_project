Dreaming of the days
We used to sit and watch the waves go by
The sun rises and falls again
But things can never be the way they were back then

And I don't know where we're going
We can never change the way the wind's blowing
I know I'd only be pretending
If I would've said we are never-ending
I wish I could say things had turned out this way

Every day was filled with sunshine
Everything felt like it all would be fine
And I would never sleep again
If I had known when I woke up it all would end

And I don't know where we're going
We can never change the way the wind's blowing
I know I'd only be pretending
If I would've said we are never-ending
I wish I could say things had turned out this way

Dreaming of the time
You made me feel like the world was mine
And now it doesn't matter what you say
Without you the sky is always gray

And I don't know where we're going
We can never change the way the wind's blowing
I know I'd only be pretending
If I would've said we are never-ending
I wish I could say things had turned out this way
