Road's getting narrow, with snakes in the shadow
And the shade where you sleep is formed by the gallows
Where a man with an arrow was hung by the shallow
Little boys little boys little boys who became what they feared

Who would have thought that the ones who spoke of trust would come to betray us?
Who would have sought love from those who prayed for peace while sowing hatred's seed?

Who would have fought for a land where blood flows till it clots each river?
Who would have sons knowing all the orphans they would soon deliver?

Kneel beside me, in this field of memory
Don't become those you fear; don't kill what you've been

Cause the straight and narrow has snakes in the shadow
And the shade where you sleep is formed by the gallows
Where a man with an arrow was hung by the shallow
Little boys little boys little boys who became what they feared

You should have known: the snakes were figments of imagination
You should have shown: the roads and gallows were your creation

Sleep beside me, there's no time to worry
The sound that you hear - it comes from your ear

Cause the road gets narrow, with snakes in the shadow
And the shade where you sleep is formed by the gallows
Where a man with an arrow was hung by the shallow
Little boys little boys little boys - there's a choice!

The straight and narrow has snakes in the shadow
And the shade where you sleep is formed by the gallows
Where a man with an arrow was hung by the shallow
Little boys and their toys; little boys who became what they feared

Weep beside me, in this sea of memory
Don't you see what I see... you're the men that you fear

When the road gets narrow, with snakes in the shadow
And the shade where you sleep is formed by the gallows
Where a man with an arrow was hung by the shallow
...What's the point!

When the road gets narrow, with snakes in the shadow
And the shade where you sleep is formed by the gallows
Where a man with an arrow was hung by the shallow
Little boys little boys there's a choice there's a choice

When the road gets narrow, with snakes in the shadow
And the shade where you sleep is formed by the gallows
Where a man with an arrow was hung by the shallow
Little boys little boys little boys don't become what you fear
