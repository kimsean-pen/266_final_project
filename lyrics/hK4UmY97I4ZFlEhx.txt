Get away from me
Hide your shame from me
Get away somehow
You drag me down
Denials over, just wait and see
I don't owe you anything
And you don't own me

I will not forget

Don't burden me with all of your problems
Don't weigh me down with all of your fears
Cutting you out of my life forever
To tear apart this pain that I feel

Everyday's the same
Driving me insane
Just take one step back
I'm getting my life on track
Realizing now
How you bring me down
I'm in such a better place

Without you around

I will not forget
Don't burden me with all of your problems
Don't weigh me down with all of your fears
Cutting you out of my life forever

To tear apart this pain that I feel

The pain that I feel Tear apart
Tear apart the pain that I feel
I will not forget
Don't burden me with all of your problems
Don't weigh me down with all of your fears
Cutting you out of my life forever
To tear apart this pain that I feel
