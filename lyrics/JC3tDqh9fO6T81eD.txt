God is my witness and my friend
How do you explain these solitary inclinations?
Such is my freedom has no end
Life it slips by you it's just past and then it's over

How you gonna live?
How you gonna live?
How you gonna live if you can't love?
How you gonna live if you can't love?

Lean in and listen
No one innocent
Here lies nothing
No way that was the best of it

Come in here with a look in your eyes
No that's fine, you woke me up, we'll talk of old times
And you don't know, you have no idea
What's going on in this sick sick sick imagination

How am I gonna live?
How am I gonna live?
How am I gonna live if I can't love?
I don't wanna live if I can't love

Lean in and listen
No one innocent
Here lies nothing
No way that was the best of it

Lean in and listen
No one innocent
Here lies nothing
No way that was the best of it
