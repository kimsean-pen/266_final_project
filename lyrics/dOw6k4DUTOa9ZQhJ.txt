All I need from you is a good conversation, conversation
'Cause it gives me sweet inspiration
And to tell you, I never felt this way before
I know there is someway today

Love your brothers
Love your sisters

And to tell you I must admit you've got me thinking
There were times I thought that I was thinking
But I always want to be in that position where I can see more clearly
Now I must admit that you've got me thinking

Love your brothers
Love your sisters

And to tell you I must admit, you've got me thinking
There were times I thought that I was thinking
But I always want to be in that position where I can see more clearly
Now I must admit that you've got me thinking

Love your brothers
Love your sisters
