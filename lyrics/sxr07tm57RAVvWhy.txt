I've been around and around but I got nowhere to go now
But the funny thing is that when I'm gone I'll kill you

When I tell you
I don't want you here

I've been around and around but I got nowhere to go now
But the funny thing is that when I'm gone I'll kill you

When I tell you
I don't want you here

I've been around and around but I got nowhere to go now
But the funny thing is that when I'm gone I'll kill you

When I tell you
When I tell you, oh yeah
When I tell you
I don't want you here
