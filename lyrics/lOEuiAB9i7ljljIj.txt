I wish I knew which button to push
Then I'd know how to please you
It's sad but true

So I'll just listen in down the line
While you're busy mixing grape with grain
To sedate your pain

Songbird, you got tales to tell
How many times can you describe your livin' hell?

The sweeping gesture creates a fuss
It's only useful when receivin' praise
Relieving no ones pain

If you'd let somebody love you just enough
You'd have everything you'd need to break
Free from all your pain

Songbird, you got tales to tell
How many times can you describe your livin' hell?

I wish I knew which button to push
Then I'd know how to please you
It's sad but true

If you'd let somebody love you just enough
Let somebody love you just enough
Let somebody love you just enough
Let somebody love you just enough
