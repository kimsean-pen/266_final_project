Mirrorball on a Jordan train
I was under sea then up for air again

Ocean Park where the seagulls cry
I remember flying dragons too
I was there with you

So before you log out
Hold close to me
Hold close to me

I'll be back when December comes
All the barriers have been pulled down
Where is everyone?
Oh Mirrorball
Spinning out to sea
Think I found you in the temple square
Under the wishing tree

So I cried my eyes out
Hold close to me
Hold close to me

I cried my eyes out
Hold close to me
Hold close to me
Hold close to me
Hold close to me
