never was much given to prayer
but lately I'm pleading with the air
to keep you safe from harm my dears

the only things that you should keep in rows
are your perfect teeth - and the rest you know
its own sweet way will always go

add your footsteps to the wear
for a tiny deny in every stair
wil let them know that you've been there
