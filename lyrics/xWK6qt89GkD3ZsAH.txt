In this life you think that you're the only one
I can see in how you choose your holy ones
And if you think you should be safe from where you've come
I can vouch for all the time you have to move on

Maybe you'll see the pity that I think I do disguise
But I can't (?) be eager to feed the flies
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Chain bitter medicine
The bitter, crawling low
Wearing on your mind
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
