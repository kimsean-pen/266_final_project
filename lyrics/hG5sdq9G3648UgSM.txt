I been in the game for a long time
Sixteen hours that's a long flight
You rob me you rob from the wrong guy
She date me at the wrong time
Yeah, hold on
Sixteen hours that's a long flight
You rob me you rob from the wrong guy
She date me at the wrong time

We don't see nothing wrong
Over here James Mao
我的錢包也很胖
BBW where you from

我不是烏鴉哥也不是耀洋哥
Ladies follow my lead
She take my breath
She body like 黃金比例
考驗著我的體力

No Name Studio B
度過了無數個long night
You still play toy we got hits boy
I just do my thing that's so nice

My purple hair like lean in the cup
讓所有night club放剛出爐的歌
當冰塊掉進一杯可口的可樂
簡單暴力anything垂手可得
Oh don't tell my mom
I bought her a car
Gotta whole lotta guap
I can't get enough
Don't tell my mom
I bought her a car
Gotta whole lotta guap
I can't get enough

I been in the game for a long time
Sixteen hours that's a long flight
You rob me you rob from the wrong guy
She date me at the wrong time
Yeah, hold on
Sixteen hours that's a long flight
You rob me you rob from the wrong guy
She date me at the wrong time

Five star rap star race car we are strangers
Speaking Chinese eating white cheese
Hitting type beats
旅行再一次

Don't worry about me
Overseas 都在talking about me
Talking about my ice talking about my vibe
Talking about my music
You wanna fuck with me I wanna twice

任何事都沒問題
能用錢 解決掉的事情 都不叫問題
紅眼病 嫉妒心沒人情才是你的問題
I have dream fast cars sunshine 比基尼

每天good morning 都在這個場景
California海邊有我不能說的秘密
I fucking my girl I look like a psycho
She too loud my neighbor叫來了50

Take off my shoes take off my clothes
Take off my everything
只為了填飽我肚子

Who I am Higher brothers wear icy chains
你的feel誰在乎 鑰匙裝背帶褲
他們排隊只為看我們show

Shout out to my man headache
Shout out to the no name studio
Yeah
Shout out to everybody
Woah (woah, woah)

I been in the game for a long time
Sixteen hours that's a long flight
You rob me you rob from the wrong guy
She date me at the wrong time
Yeah, hold on
Sixteen hours that's a long flight
You rob me you rob from the wrong guy
She date me at the wrong time
