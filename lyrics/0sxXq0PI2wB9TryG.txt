I refuse to remain in regret
To pander like a slave to your wants
No contrition from me will you get
No submission to dilettantes

I've existed too long in secret
I have lived like a man confined
Epicene and elaborate
Fatalistic and resigned

Passionflower
Catherine wheel
Higher power
Help me start to heal

Now I've bathed in the sea of sunset
And the rain washes clean my mind
Every one of my needs will be met

Every planet will be aligned

Passionflower
Catherine wheel
Higher power
Help me start to heal

Over power all my fear
From hour to hour
Guide me through the realm

I refuse to remain in regret
I refuse to be left behind

Passionflower
Catherine wheel
Higher power
Help me start to heal
