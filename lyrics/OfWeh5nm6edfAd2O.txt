She went from table manners to tunnel vision to premature farewells
With a restlessness reserved for those who believe in themselves
She thought the world was hers so she made sure it bent beneath her will
She was as new and as ancient as the solar paneled hills
She was certain she could take this town by storm
The wonder of sound and light seeking a form
But somewhere along the way
The dots didn't all connect
The promise became regrets
Somewhere along the way
The dream and the circumstance
Continue their tortured dance
Somewhere along the way
She was my lullaby personified, my vision in the mist
But her contacts were all promoters and a westside therapist T
he 5ams, the worried friends, the parting of her lips
But I needed to witness someone wrestle with what it means to just exist
How her only plan in life was getting lost
How she took me to the edge and made me watch
But somewhere along the way
The running just lost it's fun
It happens to everyone
Somewhere along the way
Her trail became too obscure
But that was her signature
She would talk about letting go - I guess I didn't understand
Giving over to the currents that were there since time began
And on a long drive from El Paso to the Pacific Ocean cliffs
I finally felt connected to the continental drift
But somewhere along the way I started to smile again
I don't remember when
Somewhere along the way
Things will turn out just fine
I know it's true this time
