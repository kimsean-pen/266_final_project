Break down your walls tonight
We're here to sing for you
Tear down your walls tonight
We're here to scream for you!
Break down your walls tonight

We're here to sing for you
Tear down your walls tonight
We're here to scream for you

Cold as ice on the darkest December
Spark a flame from a small burning ember
Trapped inside of this prison made of mirrors

As I wait for that spark to ignite me
Try to break through these walls that surround me
I'm trapped inside of this prison made of mirrors
I look to the sky

But my walls keep building higher
I'm surrounded by creations, I
Need to feel alive
I look to the sky

But the answers all around me
Oh I don't know why I have to try
To take hold of my life
The worst part of all

Is I'm the one who holds the key (holds the key)
Prison of my mind
Only purpose sets me free
And I have no purpose at all
I'm floating and hoping

For something to come break my fall

I've lost my mind
I've lost it all
Now repeat after me...
I walk
I breathe
I live
A lie
I walk
I breathe
I live
A lie
I walk
I breathe
I live
A lie
I walk
I breathe
I live
A lie
