There is a part of me that's always sixteen
I've found the secret of eternal youth
Some get high on life or money
But there's an escape, drop out of the race

To walk through world by one's self, you can't be protected
Your trust is in whiskey, weed and Black Sabbath
It's goddamn electric

Don't waste your time
Embrace it
And then you will know yourself
The change in you is goddamn electric

The weight of the world has lifted and parted
My eyes roll blind to sights that distracted
Through tunnel vision and dope-hair blinders
I'll cut a path and evoke my will

To walk through the world by one's self, you can't be protected
Your trust is in whiskey, weed and Slayer
It's goddamn electric

Don't fake your life
Inhale it
And then you'll know yourself
The change in you is goddamn electric

Don't waste your time
Embrace it
And then you'll know yourself
The change that is goddamn electric will focus the mind's eye

One hand on the bottle, the other a shaking fist
Rejuvinated, yet I isolated, no pressure from the outside
My sight is goddamn electric
And these eyes have seen a world
Goddamn electric system

Don't waste your time
Embrace it
And then you'll know yourself
The change in you is goddamn electric

Goddamn electric
Goddamn electric
Goddamn electric
