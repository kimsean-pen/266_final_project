Black hair in the morning sun
Black hair in the evening one
Ring down the curtain on me
Mangled stripes of bitumen
With every hour knitted in
Put through the wringer of night

I'll be so sad to leave
I'll be so sad to leave

Poured in darkness like a guess
Saturated colourlessness
Onyx in lanes that loom up
With a lead glaze on its sleeve
Forever coming up to me
You said your love is void

Black hair in the morning sun
Black hair in the evening one
Ring down the curtain on me
Hold it there
Let it linger on my neck
Till its absence seethes the senses
And i will be so sad to leave

I'll be so sad to leave
I'll be so sad to leave
