Through the sound of raging waves
Her voice is leading me astray
I feel I need to be with her right away

For she sounds so sweet
I cannot leave her all alone
Here in this deep and dark blue unknown

Come swim to me in a forward motion
Lie with me in the arms of the ocean
Oh sing to me my lady of the sea
Show me the way with your melody

Oh my dear unwary sailor
Come to my shore
It's way safer than the roaring sea
I need you here with me

Oh my sweet unwary man
Follow my voice and take my hand
Let me take you to the promised land

Come swim to me in a forward motion
Lie with me in the arms of the ocean
Oh sing to me my lady of the sea
Show me the way with your melody

Come swim to me in a forward motion
Lie with me in the arms of the ocean
Oh sing to me my lady of the sea
Show me the way with your melody

Oh she's pulling me, into the the fathomless deep
There's nothing I can do
She's pulling me into eternal sleep
There we go
There we go

We're sinking with graceful motion
Lying forever in the arms of the ocean
Oh sing to me my lady of the sea
Sing me your lullaby
So I can go, peacefully.
