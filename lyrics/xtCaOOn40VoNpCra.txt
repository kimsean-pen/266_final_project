looks like we've made it
look how far we've come my baby
we might took the long way
we knew we made some day
the said i bet they'll never make it
but just look at us holding on
we'll still together still goin' strong
you still the one i run to
the way that i belong to
you still the one for life
you still the one that i love
the only one i dream of
you still the one i kiss good night
