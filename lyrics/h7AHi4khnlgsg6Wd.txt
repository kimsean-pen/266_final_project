Faceless fall from this life and ah, if you can't
See the star, probably gone too far
Like the voice that cried on the lonesome tide
Like the wave was the only love it ever saw

["What's this dying for?"]
Asks the stork that soars
With the owl, high above
Canyons mighty walls

Owl said, ["Death's a doorThat love walks throughIn and out, in and outBack and forth, back and forth"]

Turn from the fear of the storms that might be
Oh, let it free, that caged on fire thing
Oh, hold its hands, it'll feel like lightning
Oh, in your arms safe from the storms

Sky bends, the moon's dress' slung low, slung low
Dog star taught a dance
It goes, goes, goes, goes, goes, goes, goes
Arms out, knees bend, the motion flows
Like the soft, open petals of a Jessica Rose

So serious
So it falls apart
It just reveals the perfect nothing
Of everything you are, everything we are

Candle of life lights the blights and bruises
Oh, lay it down in the night, let it soothe this
Oh, hold its hands and we'll know what truth is
Oh, in its arms safe from the storms
