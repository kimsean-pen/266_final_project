Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo, ooo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo, ooo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo

Lay back baby an' we'll do this right
There's blankets in back we can use
I'll start the car, but we'll stay in park
The cold can kill us, before fumes

Now's the right time, for a good song
Got something to say, what I can't
Do you feel bad, like I feel bad?
Pour us a road, we'll both drink and drive

Kiss me with your cherry lipstick
Never wash you off my face
Hit me, I can take your cheap shots
Leave you with the love we made

Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo, ooo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo

Come alive on the drivers side
So close, I taste your breath
Your lips go dry, but they're sweet inside
Wine must go right to your head
(Aaa)

It'd be easy, if you get mad
But three fingers point back to you
We could stay here
Stay out all night
No one will know
Us and the moonlight

Kiss me with your cherry lipstick
Never wash you off my face
Hit me, I can take your cheap shots
Leave you with the love we made

I set my watch by a street side clock
A needle in echo groove
You pierce my heart like a willing arm
Your ticking makes my blood move

There's no way out
(There's no way out)
This fade out
(This fade out)
Be happy to get what you do
Make him notice
(Make him notice)
With both fists
'Cause quitin' alone will never get you dry

(Ooo ooo ooo ooo)
Na, na na na
(Ooo ooo ooo ooo)
Na, na na na
(Ooo ooo ooo ooo)
Na, na na na na na
(Never get you dry)

(Ooo ooo ooo ooo)
Na, na na na
(Ooo ooo ooo ooo)
Na, na na na
(Aah)
(Ooo ooo ooo ooo)
Na, na na na na na

Give me everything you got now
I don't feel a single thing
Drag me out into the cold rain
Let it hover over me

Kiss me with your cherry lipstick
(Na, na na na, na, na na na)
Never wash you off my face
(Na, na na na)
Hit me, I can take your cheap shots
(Na, na na na, na, na na na)
Leave you with the love we made
(Na, na na na)

Hit me, I can take your cheap shot
(Na, na na na, na, na na na)
Leave you with the love we made
(Na, na na na)
Take your cheap shot
(Na, na na na, na, na na na)
Leave you with the love we made
(Na, na na na, na, na na na)
