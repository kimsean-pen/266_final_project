Lazy lover, find a place for me again
You felt it once before
I know you did
I could see it

Whiskey princess, drink me under, pull me in
You had me at come over boy
I need a friend
I understand

Backseat serenade, dizzy huricane
Oh god, I'm sick of sleeping alone
You're salty like a summer day
Kiss the sweat away to your radio (Radio, radio)

Backseat serenade, little hand grenade
Oh god, I'm sick of sleeping alone
You're salty like a summer day
Kiss the pain away to your radio (Radio, radio)

You take me over, I throw you up against the wall
We've seen it all before
But this one's different
It's deliberate

You send me reeling
Calling out to you for more
The value of this moment lives in metaphor
Yeah, through it all

Backseat serenade, dizzy huricane
Oh god, I'm sick of sleeping alone
You're salty like a summer day
Kiss the sweat away to your radio (Radio, radio)

Backseat serenade, little hand grenade
Oh god, I'm sick of sleeping alone
You're salty like a summer day
Kiss the pain away to your radio (Radio, radio)

Backseat serenade, dizzy huricane
Oh god, I'm sick of sleeping alone
You're salty like a summer day
Kiss the sweat away to your radio (Radio, radio)

Backseat serenade, little hand grenade
Oh aren't you sick of sleeping alone?
(Aren't you sick of sleeping alone?)
You're salty like a summer day
Kiss the pain away to your radio (Radio, radio)
(Oh god, I'm sick of sleeping alone)
