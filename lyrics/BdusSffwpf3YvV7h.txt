Amphetamine
Raised her since three
He was a hope to be gutter king
Both unraveled at their seams
That were never sewn
She never had a choice
They never had a chance
He never had a choice
They never had a chance
All their devils and all their demons
Walk with me as they walked with them
All their devils and all their demons
Haunting me as they haunted them
Giving out
Giving in
