Some girls wont make no play
Happy to sit and wait
I wont be waiting all ni-i-ight

Some girls they bite their tongue
I tell you straight up front
got my attention toni-i-ight

Beats are flo-o-owing
Looks you're thro-o-owing
Get the fire up inside of me-e-e

Ain't no sto-o-o-ping
When I lo-o-ock in
Boy it's on if you can set the he-e-eat

Cos you turn me, turn me (on)
Right here, right now
I'm gon move on you
When the lights go down

I can work you baby
I'll show you how
I'm gon move on you
When the lights go down

Woahoh ohhh oh
Woahoh oh oh oh
I'm gon move on you
When the lights go down

Woahoh ohhh oh
Woahoh oh oh oh
I'm gon move on you
When the lights go down

I'm working up a sweat
Dripping down my neck
I got you right in my si-i-ight

Come baby be my sin
Don't worry bout a thing
Just satisfy me toni-i-ight

Beats are flo-o-owing
Looks you're thro-o-owing
Get the fire up inside of me-e-e

Ain't no sto-o-o-ping
When I lo-o-ock in
Boy it's on if you can set the he-e-eat

Cos you turn me, turn me (on)
Right here, right now
I'm gon move on you
When the lights go down

I can work you baby
I'll show you how
I'm gon move on you
When the lights go down
