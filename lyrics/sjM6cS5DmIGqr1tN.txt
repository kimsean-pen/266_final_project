A festival of torches
Joins the light of the moon
Shining in the lake
Sleeping with the stars
As good Christians
Illuminate the garden
Human candles
Burning under Roman skies

Oh
Nero lights up the night (18th to 19th of July)
Oh
(18th to 19th of July) Nero lights up the night

Paul dies, Peter dies
Lions among men
Damnation ad bestias
Almost too hard to believe

Oh
Nero lights up the night (18th to 19th of July)
Oh
(18th to 19th of July) Nero lights up the night

The princess of Wales
Her sexual drive
Stop dead under the river
In the capitol of romance
The most hunted
Body of the modern age
Flowers crown her head
Ancient goddess of the moon

Oh
Nero lights up the night (18th to 19th of July)
Oh
(18th to 19th of July) Nero lights up the night
