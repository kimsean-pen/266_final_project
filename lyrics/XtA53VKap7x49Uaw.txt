What's wrong or what's right?
I'm 'bouta take a flight, like, should I say goodbye?
Fuck that, I'mma hold onto my pride
Momma raised a soldier so I can't afford to cry

Lookin' back I see the knife in my back now
Lookin' at life wishing I was in the background
Lookin' back I see the future in the past now
Ninety in the whip, like, should I fucking crash now?

I'm so sick of this, I'm so sick of shit, nobody listening
Demons all around me, diamonds wet just like a christening
Wait, why you always high when you call me?
Why do you ask what's wrong when you saw me?

I'm so sick of this, I'm so sick of shit, nobody listening
Demons all around me, diamonds wet just like a christening
Wait, why you always high when you call me?
Why do you ask what's wrong when you saw me?

Chemicals running through my veins, I just wanna sleep
Feelings bleeding out my brain, but right now I can't feel a thing
Woke up late, time to waste away
My favorite days are the rainy days

Let it soak in then I throw it all away
I try my best but this feeling always stays
You know I try but you gotta give me space
And I don't wanna hurt you if you get in my way

I'm so sick of this, I'm so sick of shit, nobody listening
Demons all around me, diamonds wet just like a christening
Wait, why you always high when you call me?
Why do you ask what's wrong when you saw me?

I'm so sick of this, I'm so sick of shit, nobody listening
Demons all around me, diamonds wet just like a christening
Wait, why you always high when you call me?
Why do you ask what's wrong when you saw me?

Reach out just to waste my time
It's the young waste of space with his headphones on
Call me when you need me, baby
But I know I'm the last resort

You said that you loved me
How the fuck could you just love a ghost?
You said that you love me, baby
I said we are not that close

I'm so sick of this, I'm so sick of shit, nobody listening
Demons all around me, diamonds wet just like a christening
Wait, why you always high when you call me?
Why do you ask what's wrong when you saw me?

I'm so sick of this, I'm so sick of shit, nobody listening
Demons all around me, diamonds wet just like a christening
Wait, why you always high when you call me?
Why do you ask what's wrong when you saw me?

(I'm so sick)
(So sick, so sick)

Reach out just to waste my time
It's the young waste of space with his headphones on
Call me when you need me, baby
But I know I'm the last resort

You said that you loved me
How the fuck could you just love a ghost?
You said that you love me, baby
I said we are not that close
