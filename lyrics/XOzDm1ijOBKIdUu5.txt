Capture a likeness
It captures you
Reproductive its nothing
Thats secure or stable

It's just fear
Anything new
Was created to be destroyed
To be destroyed

Life begins and ends
Formless and stays that way
Life begins and ends
In a windowless room
And will carry on
Against all odds
Across all colors

Life begins and ends
Empty it's so contrived
This need to be together
I honestly have no body or soul
