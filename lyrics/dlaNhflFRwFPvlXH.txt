I don't do this for no thangs
I don't do this for no chains
I don't do this for no change (I love y'all)
I don't do it for no rings
I just do this shit cause I can
Yeah
Henny gon fill me up, I need some dope when I drink

I don't care who you is
I don't care what you did
I don't care where you live
(Fuck outta here)
Niggas know what it is
Pussy niggas on the fence
I know niggas that hit
Dirty money can't rinse
See your bitch? I bought her
Your bitch get caught up
Life gon' get you caught up
That's why I tat up my body
That's what I can't trust nobody
My niggas the wildest
We used to fuck up the parties
Girls gave me that sloppy
Late night in that dungeon

But I'll be true
If you promise that you'll defend me
I'll be true, to you
And what you are, can lay here firmly
I'll do the worrying, baby
I ain't saying "I ain't crazy"

Don't put me down
If you can be honest then
(Teach these babies how to love,
they won't know how to hate if you show 'em something different)
I'll do anything
I'll go all the way
I'll jump off a plane
Target on my chest, for you
(Oh, if you can)
If you can be honest, then
I'll do anything
I'll go all the way
I'll jump off a plane
Target on my chest, for you
