In ancient times hundreds of years before the dawn of history
Lived this strange race of people, the druids
No one knows who they were what they were doing
But the legacy remains here into the living rock of Stonehenge

Stonehenge, where the demons dwell
Where the banshees live and they do live well
Stonehenge where a man is a man
And the children dance to the pipes of pan

Stonehenge, 'tis a magic place
Where the moon doth rise with a dragon's face
Stonehenge where the virgins lie
And the prayer of devils fill the midnight sky

And you my love, won't you take my hand?
We'll go back in time to that mystic land
Where the dew drops cry and the cats meow
I will take you there, I will show you how

And oh, how they danced
The little children of Stonehenge
Beneath the haunted moon for fear
That day break might come too soon

And where were they now
The little people of Stonehenge
And what would they say to us
If we were here tonight
