Saint Peter sank my boat in the bank
we'll get married when we're thirty
singing, "hey pretty moma, hey pretty moma"
don't look so sad
ask Jesus what you want to get from me
but I can't get what I've been living
singing, "hey pretty moma, hey pretty moma"
don't look so sad
'cause everybody lies sometime
some people lie more than everybody else
and everybody dies sometime
some gotta live with the lies they made
and I lie with you, but I can't lie for you
move to Illinois, but they was Ill-adore you
standing at your door, we'll move out and change our names
just say, "hey pretty moma, hey pretty moma, hey pretty moma, hey pretty moma, hey pretty moma"
this dream I had
we'll raise a pretty baby by the beach
on a hill where nobody can see
living in time that's balance as one
some guy could see (what up girl?)
living in a house just big enough for three (house)
____ __ ____ just old enough to be (three)
onto a sky that's just like me
it's playing a little cover you only your ____, and
if that's enough for you I'll say
just say, "hey pretty moma, hey pretty moma, hey pretty moma, hey pretty moma, hey pretty moma"
ain't that nice?
singing, "hey pretty moma, hey pretty moma"
don't look so sad
