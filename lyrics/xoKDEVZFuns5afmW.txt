Her lips are like milk
She's the nightwater queen
My satisfaction grows
I cross my tears
Should you let me sow your stow

So now don't turn your pride on me
I'm not ready for defeat
I was so crazy for a week
I'm not crazy but I can't think

Nightwater girlfriend
Diving in the lake with your bad friends
Take me where you go
Don't turn your power on me
Don't turn your power on me

Tell me about your boyfriend
Did he ever swim to the end?
And did you try to get mad... at 3 AM?
Did he ask where you've been

So now don't turn your pride on me
I'm not ready for defeat
I was so crazy for a week
I'm not crazy but I can't think

Nightwater girlfriend
Diving in the lake with your bad friends
I'm in love with you
Don't turn your power on me
Don't turn your power on me

Nightwater girlfriend
Getting high in the backseat
Never change, never let them in
Don't turn your power on me
Don't turn your power on me

You make me glow
Satisfaction, all I know
And finally girl I'm so
Up to the tear cycle

I'm down down to your real heart again
But I'm so deep again

Nightwater girlfriend
Diving in the lake with your bad friends
I'm in love with you
Don't turn your power on me
Don't turn your power on me

Nightwater girlfriend
Getting high in the backseat
Never change, never let them in
Don't turn your power on me
Don't turn your power on me
