Storm clouds hanging over head.
Offer not the slightest bit of comfort for the first time in days.
I wait to discover disasters that ive slept though while I felt so alive.
So we say goodbye, so we say goodbye.
Heartstrings severed just as quick as they were discovered.
So we say goodbye, so we say goodbye.
Ill break my own fall, to keep you picture perfect.
Just don't wake me up now...
So say goodbye, close your eyes for the last time, questioning everything that went wrong...
The silence she whispers to me,
Telling me things we dare to speak out loud.
The collaboration of the blinding sun through vacant streets hits home hard, like a hatchet to the skull.
Id keep you here if it kept me warm and these winters away.
Your hands were the only hands needed to hold me.
For the first time in days... I feel alive.
In the end we'll both rot together.
In the end we'll rot together, our love lies in embers
So say goodbye, close your eyes for the last time, questioning everything that went wrong...
Peering out of those same cracked windows.
That I studied, for days upon days...
Suddenly collapse... It all falls down.
So say goodbye, close your eyes for the last time, questioning everything that went wrong...
