Wake up every day, know that I am blessed
Counting up my cake, getting all them checks
Pull up in a Wraith, I'm just trying to flex
Why you want to hate, you do it the best
I'm a high roller
You know I'm a high roller
You know I'm a high roller
You know I'm a high roller

Driving like I stole it
Double parking bitch you better not tow it
Please show me my opponent
I said please show me my opponent
I'm so young I could fuck on your niece
Walk on your knees
Driving my car and that bitch ain't no lease
I am a beast
Look at my pockets they so obese
They so obese
I eat up like its at a feast
Yeezy my feet
I put Louie V, Don C my wrists
Ferragamo, that's all on my wrists
I know that girl can really suck dick
Cause she talk to me right with a lisp
I pour lean up right that's so crisp
She suck like a tick
I got paper nigga and you know it
I swear to God I really can't miss
I make hits I really can't miss
Even if I miss that shit'll hit
Stack my money then watch as it flip
Spend my money then do it again
I swear to God she a ten
Keep her around I swear that girl she a gem
Before I was on, fucked on the twins
Before I was on, fucked on the twins
Raf Simons, Rick Owens, little Phillip Lim
She said she ain't want me, so I fucked her friend
Open up my mouth white diamonds when I grin
I am not from this earth like Invader Zim
Nowadays, I am on everybody kin
Walk around with my Barbie like I am Ken
Everyday adventure time feel like I'm Finn
I might just put some diamonds all on my wrist
Every bitch in my face don't give 'em kiss
Boy you hate cause you can't live your life like this

Wake up every day, know that I am blessed
Counting up my cake, getting all them checks
Pull up in a Wraith, I'm just trying to flex
Why you want to hate, you do it the best
I'm a high roller
You know I'm a high roller
You know I'm a high roller
You know I'm a high roller

I swear to God she a ten
Keep her around I swear that girl she a gem
Before I was on, fucked on the twins
Before I was on, fucked on the twins
Raf Simons, Rick Owens, little Phillip Lim
She said she ain't want me so I fucked her friend
Open up my mouth white diamonds when I grin
Goyard bags cost more than your rent
Goyard wallet cost more than your Gucci
Put my baby girl in Ferrari Moncler she bougie
Boy I'm cool everybody know you a shoobie
Nowadays I can't even go to the movies
Mood swing, mood swing girl you gon' lose me
Mood swing, mood swing girl you gon' lose me
Same thing over and over girl you can't fool me
Same thing over and over girl you can't fool me

Wake up every day, know that I am blessed
Counting up my cake, getting all them checks
Pull up in a Wraith, I'm just trying to flex
Why you want to hate, you do it the best
I'm a high roller
You know I'm a high roller
You know I'm a high roller
You know I'm a high roller
