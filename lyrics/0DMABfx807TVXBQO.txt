Online you never feel alone
I never feel alive when I'm on the phone
All I'd wanna say are just words anyway
I'm spending too much time IRL

What you you gonna tell your children?
What did you learn today?
What you gonna tell your parent
When you know that they will say
Everything was so different
I remember back in the days
We were looking for life in outer space

I knocked on every door
Until I knocked them down
Standing there I saw
There was nothing there behind
I opened every drawer
But someone had before
Only leaving me a note saying
"Now the World is Yours"
Online I never feel alone
I never feel alive
Call it what you like, In Real Life

Mom and Dad don't blame the kids
For what you had and what you did with it
You can call it what you like
Online I never feel alone I never feel alive
I never feel alone I never feel alive
Call it what you like, In Real Life
