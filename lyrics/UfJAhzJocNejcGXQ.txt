Well, I read it in town in the melancholy news
The front page story is our love is through
The hand of time is cold, I can't stand to hear the truth
Somehow I won't believe it till I've heard it from you
There's no time for talk and there's no place for tears
There's no reason to wonder after all of these years
Sure we had some good times and so who's to blame
It's so hard to tell when you both feel the pain
After the years have come and gone
The struggle to forget you will have just begun
We had our ups and downs but one thing's for sure
No one will ever love you more
There's no time for talk and there's no place for tears
And there's no reason to wonder after all of these years
Sure we had some good times and so who's to blame
It's so hard to tell when you both feel the pain
