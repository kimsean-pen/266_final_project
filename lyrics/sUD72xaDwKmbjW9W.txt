She knows her grief is a beast
That kills from inside
She lifts the souls from their home
At aerial high tide

No moments alone, no sorrow to share
In search of a key you know is not there
Oh no, Loreley
Oh no, Loreley

With arms to the sky and dreams in the dirt
Being stronger than death does not heal the hurt
Oh no, Loreley
Oh no, Loreley

Cry, Loreley
Cry for Eden, Loreley
Cry, Loreley
Cry for Eden, Loreley

She's starved of light, no respite
Each breath's a burden
Time can't reverse her grim curse of life eternal

No moments alone, no sorrow to share
In search of a key you know is not there
Oh no, Loreley
Oh no, Loreley

Cry, Loreley
Cry for Eden, Loreley
Cry, Loreley
Cry for Eden, Loreley

Scream for me
Scream for me
Scream for me
Scream for me

Cry, Loreley
Cry for Eden, Loreley

Cry, Loreley
Cry for Eden, Loreley
Cry, Loreley
Cry for Eden, Loreley

Cry for Eden, Loreley
Loreley
Loreley
