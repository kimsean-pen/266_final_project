I admire your perseverance

Everytime my back is turned your falling closer into my world
I've told you so many times you need to back down, need to back down
I told you you need to walk away all the countless efforts I have made
One day I'll get you back, I swear I'll get you back

Will this ever end or will time stand still forever?
Will this ever end or will time stand still forever?

Everytime my back is turned you're falling closer to my world
How can you sleep when you know what you're doing to me?
Everytime my back is turned you're falling closer to my world
How can you sleep when you know what you're doing to me?

I told you you need to walk away
Fuck all the efforts that I have made, I've got you right where I want you

After all the years I've known you, when did you decide to fuck this up?
After all the years I've known you, when did you decide to try and fuck this up?
I still admire your
Your perseverance

How did you think you'd get away with
How did you think you'd get away with
How did you think you'd get away with this?
With this, with this

And it's time to teach you a lesson that you're never gonna fucking forget
You are never gonna forget, not any time soon
You're never gonna forget me
You're never gonna forget me
