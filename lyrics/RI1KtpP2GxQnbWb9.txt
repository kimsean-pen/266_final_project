She likes to watch the moon
As it travels through the sky
Because she's heard it's romantic
Though she really can't see why

Someone should have helped her through the day
Someone like the moon
So she drinks a cup of coffee
And telephones a friend
And she asks if she can make it
So this night never ends
And someone should have helped her through the day
Someone like the moon

But the light comes and the day bleeds through the sky
And the sun makes it hard to get through
And the radio only plays love songs and she cries
Because she knows it's such a bad thing to do

In the evening it gets better
And she thinks how it's not right
That someone so stupid
Can so easily screw up your life

Someone should have helped her through the day
Someone like the moon
But the light came and the day bled through the sky
And the sun, the sun made it hard to get through
And the radio only played love songs so she cried
Oh she knew, it's such a bad thing to do

Oh can't you see, can't you see
Someone should have told her you had gone
Oh someone like the moon
Can't you see, can't you see
Someone should have told her you had gone
Oh someone like the moon
