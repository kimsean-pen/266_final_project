I'm lost in this world 'cause I've lost my way
I've got no place to go, I've got nothing to say
I walk down the road and I'm on my track
Girl, I look straight ahead, but I don't look back

For misery, hope, and [?] my life
I'm in love with you girl, but I love my wife
The treasures evolved and I look up above
And I sailed up the skies, and I wonder why

'Cause you're lost in this world when you lose your way
And you've lost all your hope, you've got nothing to stay
In love with you girl when you treat me right
I'm in love with you girl but you made me cry

I want love
But I don't want pain
And it's happening again
I want love
But I can't stand still
And your love is making me ill

I want love
But I can't stand pain
And it's happening again
I want love
But I can't stand still
And your love is making me ill

I want love
But I can't stand pain
Watch it go down the drain once again
Here it goes
