Oh, the time has come, it's up to me
And all the city lights, I want them to seduce me
And the two of us, we are so far away
And you are always on my mind and it's not fiction

I see the waves, will they take us?
I want to feel all your heat on the inside

You're so likable and you'll be famous
I breathe in and out and I wait, when can I see you? Oh

I see the waves, will they take us?
I want to feel all your heat on the inside
On the inside, on the inside
On the inside, on the inside
