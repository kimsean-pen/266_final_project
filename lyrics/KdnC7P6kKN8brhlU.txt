And when the lamb
opened the first seal,
I saw the first Horse.
The Horseman held a bow.

Now when the lamb
opened the second seal,
I saw the second Horse.
The Horseman held a sword.

The leading Horse is white,
the second Horse is red,
the third one is a black,
the last one is a green.

And when the lamb
opened the third seal,
I saw the third Horse.
The Horseman had a balance.

Now when the lamb
opened the fourth seal,
I saw the fourth Horse.
The Horseman was the Pest.
