(Riff it down, Riff it make it flesh)
Lately I've been out of love
Seems like I'm not good enough
Maybe life's just really tough
Like a diamond in the rough
I can see more clearly now (Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
I need you to trust me now (No no no, no no no)
I want you to hear me out, yeah (Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
All I'll do is scream and shout (No no no, no no no)
(Riff it down, Riff it make it flesh)
We the generation and we have had enough
(Riff it down, Riff it make it flesh)
we the generation and we have had enough
(Riff it down, Riff it make it flesh)
we the generation and we have had enough, oh
(Riff it down, Riff it make it flesh)
we the generation and we have had enough
bet you think this is the end (AoooAhahah)
we don't wanna play pretend, No (AoooAhahah)
because you'll make mistakes again (AooAhahah)
We'll put up our best defence
I can see more clearly now (Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
I need you to trust me now (No no no, no no no)
I want you to hear me out, yeah (Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
All I'll do is scream and shout (No no no, no no no)
(Riff it down, Riff it make it flesh)
We the generation and we have had enough
(Riff it down, Riff it make it flesh)
We the generation and we have had enough
(Riff it down, Riff it make it flesh)
We the generation and we have had enough, oh
(Riff it down, Riff it make it flesh)
we the generation and we have had enough
You have had enough, I have had enough, we have had enough, Yeah
(Riff it down, Riff it make it flesh)
We the generation and we have had enough, oh
(Riff it down, Riff it make it flesh)
We the generation and we have had enough
