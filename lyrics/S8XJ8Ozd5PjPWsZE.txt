I was the last choice, no voice, regular kid
Just livin' out each day and layin' low on the grid
But then I looked at myself, and saw that I wanted more
So I assembled my troops and I stood up to the world

I will defend that, we are the vanquished, and you will not make our decisions
I won't pretend that, I'm not a victim of a world that will not listen
We will rise.

Now I'm the full grown man that you love to hate
And yeah you doubted me, but now I'm laughing in your face
You're hoping I fail, but you're just pressing your luck
'Cause the one best part of me is I don't give a... HAH HAH

I will defend that, we are the vanquished, and you will not make our decisions
I won't pretend that, I'm not a victim of a world that will not listen
They will fall, Nothing that I can't overcome
Conquer the battles one by one, crushing the head of what's become
I'm screaming at the top of my lungs

Through all the struggles I face, And through the pain I embrace
Now I've become something more than you
You think you're stronger than me, You think I fight for the weak
But we are 10 times the strength of you
I will not fall, I will fight to survive and keep this alive
We will rise without fail, Find the strength to survive and keep this alive
We will rise.

I will defend that, we are the vanquished, and you will not make my decisions
I won't pretend that, I'm not a victim of a world that will not listen
They will fall, Nothing that I can't overcome
Conquer the battles one by one, crushing the head of what's become
I'm screaming at the top of my lungs
