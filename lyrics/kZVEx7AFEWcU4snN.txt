When the moist and balmy gale
Round the verdant meadow sights,
Odours sweet in misty veil
At the twilight-hour arise
Murmurings soft of calm repose

Rock the heart to child-like rest
And the day's bright portals close
On the eyes with toil oppressed
Night already reigns over all

Strangely star linked to star
Planets, mighty sparkling small
Glitter near and gleam afar
Gleam above in clearer night

Glitter in the glassy sea
Pledging pure and calm delight
Rules the moon in majesty
Now each well known hour is over

Trust the newborn eye of day
Vales grow verdant, hillocks teem
Shady nooks the bushes yield and with waving silvery gleam
Wouldst thou wish for wish obtain

Cast the shell of sleep away
Tarry not, but be thou bold
When the many loiter still
All with ease may be controlled
