CHORUS
I'm a wartime killer
I'm a man
I'm a peacetime killer
Doin the best I can
Bless yourself with a fiery hand
Spit on the place you stand
Don't make amends for what you do
Or move on your demands
Imagination running wild
We're all an only child
Product of our environment
Cut, blown and styled
CHORUS
I'm a wartime killer
I'm a man
I'm a peacetime killer
Doin the best I can
I adapt to nothing
And nothing please me
I'm a loaded pistol
Just you wait and see
Infliction, I am here
Infection, where do we go from here
Inception, made it clear
As I move into the plan
At birth I made a deal
Called into the killings fields
I go
CHORUS
I'm a wartime killer
I'm a man
I'm a peacetime killer
Doin the best I can
I adapt to nothing
And nothing pleases me
I'm a loaded pistol
Just you wait and see
I'm a wartime killer
I'm a man
I'm a peacetime killer
Doin the best I can
