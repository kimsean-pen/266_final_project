The times are changing so fas
I wonder how long it lasts.
The clock is ticking time is running out.
The hatred fills this Earth
and for what is worth
we're in the end before we now.

Throughout the years
I have struggled to find the answer that
I never new.
It struck me like a million lightnings
and here I am telling to you.

Every second of day it is coming your way
future unknown is here to stay.
Got to open your mind
or you will be led to astray.

There's a time to live
there's a time to die.
But no one can escape the Destiny.

Look all the things we've done
under the burning sun.
Is this the way to carry on?
So take a look at yourself
and tell me what do you see.
A wolf in clothes of the lamb?

Throughout the years
I have struggled to find the answer that
I never new.
It struck me like a million lightnings
and here I am telling to you.

Every second of day it is coming your way
future unknown is here to stay.
Got to open your mind
or you will be led to astray.

Let your spirit free
through window of your mind.
Unchain your soul from hate
all you need is faith.
I control my Life
I am the One.
You control your Life
but don't forget Your Destiny...

It's time to say goodbye
I know it will make you cry.
You make your destiny.
I know you'll find the way.
And outside the Sun is bright.
The things will be allright.
I will be back one day to you.
So please wait for ME
