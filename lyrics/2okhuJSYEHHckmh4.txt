My father said to me
As he puffed his pipe and Baby B
He dandled on his knee
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away
Keep all good company
Oh, ho, oh, ho
Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company

Soon, I grew up and happy too
My very good friends and me
We'd play all day with Sally J
The girl from number four
Very soon, I begged her, "Won't you keep me company?"
Oh, ho, oh, ho
Oh, ho, oh, ho
Come marry me forevermore
We'll be good company

Now marriage is an institution, sure
My wife and I, our needs and nothing more
All my friends by a year
By and by disappeared
But we're safe enough behind our door

I flourished in my humble trade
My reputation grew
The work devoured my waking hours
But when my time was through
Reward of all my efforts
My own limited company

I hardly noticed Sally, as we parted company
All through the years, in the end, it appears
There was never really anyone, but me

Now I'm old, I puff my pipe
But no-one's there to see
I ponder on the lesson of my life's insanity
Take care of those you call your own, own, own
And keep good company
