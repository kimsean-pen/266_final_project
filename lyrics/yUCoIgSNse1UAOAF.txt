You said I didn't cry out to the clouds for nothing
You told me everything eventually works out
That's what I'll keep telling myself

I don't wanna be
Jealous of the trees next to my neighbor's garage anymore
I'll just lie in the mess I made

Don't let me fall off the edge and break down
Try not to forget everything I said

Just another week
And I'll pick myself up off my bony knees
I guess it took a year to realize that what I had was
Everything I needed to feel okay
But still I've got these sleepy eyes
That have seen too much for me to handle

I'm not gonna lie
My skin and bones have seen some better days
Thirty pounds ago seemed like a more stable place to stay

I'm not gonna lie
My skin and bones have seen some better days
I'm not gonna lie
My skin and bones have seen some better days

Just another week
And I'll pick myself up off my bony knees
I guess it took a year to realize that what I had was
Everything I needed to feel okay
But still I've got these sleepy eyes
That have seen too much for me to handle

There's no point to the floorboards in my house
Nothing feels right
And I can't stand up without you
Nothing feels right

Just another week
And I'll pick myself up off my bony knees
I guess it took a year to realize that what I had was
Everything I needed to feel okay
But still I've got these sleepy eyes
That have seen too much for me to handle
