I heard about a great big swindle
I read about it in a book
the book flew out the window
was later found by geeks and crooks

Now theyre singing hallelujah
i wondering just what did they find
they said eh what's it to yah
just take a place in line

And wait, so I wait
I wait, and wait and I...

I'm one of a few survivors
and a drawer labeled lost and found
though troubled and some deep sea divers
whos oxygens are pouring out

Now maybe if their gods be willin
they'll give us something to fill our empty cups
sit down in the boat dont spill it
or we'll just have to line back up

And wait, so we wait
we wait and wait yes we wait
and we wait
we can wait
we will wait till we...

You can hear it in the beat they march to
you can feel the earth shake when they start to dance
you can tell by the way they move you
its not murder its an act of faith baby

And as the world moves faster
whip lashing us around and round
its quite a slow disaster
and people keep on falling down

Yes we wait, we wait
and we wait
we wait
and we wait
we wait
