Oh, yeah

Just when I thought I put you off
Silly old me, I called too many times
Thought you were about to muck me up
Here I am getting all messed up by thoughts of fireside

Did you drive all night saying
What use is the night when you can't sleep anyway?
You might be tired but the fact of the matter is
You're standing right in front of my face

You save me
Save me from hate and it's so close to love
No one's ever done anything like this for me before
No one's ever drove for miles to make me smile before

I started to worry, do I smell nice?
And like a fool I left my, my gum on the side
And then I go and kiss you and the follow up from that
Was a whole bunch of nothing, wondering where you're at?

But did you drive all night saying
What use is the night when you can't sleep anyway?
You might be tired but the fact of the matter is
You're standing right in front of my face

You save me
Save me from hate and it's so close to love
No one's ever done anything like this for me before
No one's ever drove for miles to make me smile before, ha

No one's ever done anything like this for me before
No one's ever drove for miles to make me smile before

I'm happy I was wrong, at least I can sing a love song
There's no reason to believe in life outside the bitter rain
I'm glad that I was wrong, baby
I can see that we're high, I can see that we're feeling

Did you drive all night saying
What use is the night when you can't sleep anyway?
You might be tired but the fact of the matter is
You're standing right in front of my face

You save me
And no one's ever done anything like this for me before, no
No one's ever drove for miles to make me smile before

Did you drive all night
What use is the night when you can't sleep anyway?
You might be tired
But now you're standing right in front of my face

And you save me
You save me from hate and it's so close to love
No one, baby
Said, no one's ever done anything like this for me before
No one's ever drove for miles to make me smile

Tell me this boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Oh, yeah, uh, huh, la, la, la
Ah, ah, yeah, la, da, da, yeah
You drive all night

And did you drive all night saying
What use is the night when you can't sleep anyway?
You might be tired but the fact of the matter is
You're standing right in front of my face

You save me
Save me from hate, it's so close to love
And no one's ever done anything like this for me before, baby
No one's ever drove for miles to make me smile before

Um, yeah, um, um
