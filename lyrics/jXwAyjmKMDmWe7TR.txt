She radiated haute couture
Fancy machinery and free literature
Yet I knew something was not quite right
Disregarding that, what was there not to like?

Destination unknown

Weird times
Futurism is the loneliest job

The meter got to melting
The auditor screamed
Your thetan levels are far too extreme
She ran the numbers
There was no mistake
You don't belong here
You must be from out of state

Futurism is the loneliest job

I'm in the mood for technological innovation
The likes of which humanity has never seen
I'm in the mood for big time cosmic revelation
The likes of which would make
You think more highly of me
