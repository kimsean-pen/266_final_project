In the night
In the darkest of dark we were bright
We are holy fire, the light
Crashing to the ground

Lovers with a foreign name
Say it, do you feel the same?
The one worth fighting for?

Echoes crash, in to it all, we separate, the bodies fall...

Heaven, I'm in Heaven

In the night... It's a one shot shout to the light...
We are holy, fighting the fight,
IT KEEPS US HOLDING ON...

Was it just another game?
Say it once and feel my pain

Heaven, I'm heaven
Heaven, I'm heaven
Will it die, if we close our close in the dark...
Heaven, I'm heaven.
