I got myself into a little bit of trouble
Put my fingers right into the flame and now im burning
Never thought id lose my faith and fall so far from heaven
But now im driving like the devil on the run
Wind in my hair
And OMG
I can hear the sirens, here they come
Heartbeat like bagging drum
Trouble
Oh, im in trouble
Dove into the water and now i cant breath
Thought that I could touch but its too deep
But now im driving like the devil on the run
Wind in my hair
And OMG
I can hear the sirens, here they come
Heartbeat like bagging drum
But now im driving like the devil on the run
Wind in my hair
And OMG
I can hear the sirens here they come
Heartbeat like bagging drum
Oh im in trouble
Im in trouble
Trouble
Im in trouble
Im in trouble
Im in trouble
