You know what they say about getting older
It's only a doorway away
You know what they say about getting colder
In the middle of the day

You can live in the corner of my room
And I will live somewhere between
The ceiling and the wall
And if I need anything at all
I'll call out to you, that's what I'll do

Oh, here we go again
Oh, here we go again
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, here we go again
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, here we go again

I'll sit out on the front sofa
While your hands, they talk to me
All of this dragging around
It's not as fun as it used to be

Oh, here we go again
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, here we go again
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, baby, here we go again
Woah, oh, oh, here we go again

All that I wanted, all that I needed
All that I wanted, all that I needed

Woah, here we go again
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, baby, here we go again
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, here we go again
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, baby, here we go again
