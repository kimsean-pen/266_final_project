The whole night
The whole -- tell me, I need to know
Where do you wanna go
Cuz if you're down
I'll take it slow
Make you lose control

Baby, would you like
To spend the night
The whole night
And maybe, if you play it right
You can be my guy

The whole night
Do you mind if I
The whole night
The whole night
Would you mind if I
The whole night

Do you mind if I take you home tonight
Stay another day
If that's OK
Tell me baby
Would you mind if I take you home with me
Where no one can see
So don't be shy
Baby baby

Baby
I like your style
So let's get it on
Cause when we touch
I can't get enough
I'm falling for you
Honey, would you like
To make love tonight
The whole night
And baby
If you play it right
You can be all mine

The whole night
Do you mind if I
The whole night
The whole night
Would you mind if I
The whole night
The whole
Baby, honey, baby, baby, honey, baby

Baby, would you like
To make love tonight
The whole night
And baby, if you play it right
You can be all mine x9
