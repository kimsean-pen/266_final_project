Yes say, yes say, yes say, yes say, yes
(Yes say, yes say, yes say, yes say)
I'm sorry it took me so long
I'm sorry it took me so long (to come around)
I'm sorry it took me so long (to come around)

Your famous last words started
Once your fingers hit the snooze
Just nine more minutes, please (and they)
They all know where to find me
Every word that I said
What a big mistake
And the words you left out, keeping me away
Well, I will never make another promise (without you)
I will never make another promise (with you in mind)

So pace the stairs to your apartment
Like that's where you wanna be (where you wanna be)
It's where you wanna be (where you wanna be)

I'm sorry it took me so long
I'm sorry it took me so long (to come around)
I'm sorry it took me so long (to come around)

Well, there's a secret I've been perfecting
I swore I wouldn't but you let me
I'm comfortably confused (and you)
You've gotten so removed

You know I, I could take the place of those pills
Ocean blue, paint it white
Now who ya gonna call tonight?
Well, I will never make another promise (without you)
I will never make another promise (with you in mind)

So pace the stairs to your apartment
Like that's where you wanna be (where you wanna be)
It's where you wanna be (where you wanna be)
So pace the stairs to your apartment
Like that's where you wanna be (where you wanna be)
It's where you wanna be (where you wanna be)

We'll paint our sins on the ceiling
I keep them glued to my chest
It keeps me close like a promise kept
(Yes, say yes, say yes, say yes, say yes)

If I talk in my sleep, will you just keep trying
(We paint our sins on the ceiling)
I'm not giving up if you just keep trying
(I keep them glued to my chest)
If I talk in my sleep
(It keeps me close like a promise kept)
If I talk in my sleep

Yes say yes, say yes, say yes, say yes
I'm sorry it took me so long
Say yes, say yes, say yes, say yes
I'm sorry it took me so long

So pace the
(I don't want to stop you, I just want to know.)
Stairs to your apartment
Like that's where you wanna be
(I'm sorry it took me so long
[I don't want to stop you, I just want to know])
Where you wanna be
Where you wanna be
