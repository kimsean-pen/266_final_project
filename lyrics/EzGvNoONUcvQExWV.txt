Take a sip
And pass it on
Fill it up
Until it's gone
Send around
Another one
Let's sing
Another song

About the time
When we were young
And all the crazy
Shit we've done
Living like
The special ones
In the sun

We're never gonna call
No we're never gonna write
I don't ever care
Because we always got tonight
Together

Let's stay together

Say you will
Remember me
When you go
Take a piece
Of melody
To help you keep
The memory
Never let it go
So when the song
Begins to play
I hope it takes
You close to me
And for a moment
We will be
Unforgettable

Oh oh oh
Unforgettable

For years and years
Have passed away
A millon words
I should've said
Familiar notes
Begins again
And bring me back to you
So put our song
On repeat
Close your eyes
And fall asleep

And I will meet
You in a dream
Lay with me

We're never gonna call
No we're gonna write

I don't even care
Because we always got tonight
Together
Let's stay together

Say you will
Remember me
When you go
Take a piece
Of melody
To help you keep
The memory
Never let it go
So when the song
Begins to play
I hope it takes
You close to me
And for a moment
We will be

Unforgettable
Oh oh oh
Unforgettable
Oh oh oh

Unforgettable

We were meant to be together in the end
Woah, woah
When I hear the music yeah it takes me back again
Woah, woah

Say you will
Remember me
When you go
Take a piece
Of melody
To help you keep
The memory
Never let it go
So when the song
Begins to play
I hope it takes
You close to me
And for a moment
We will be
Unforgettable
Oh oh oh
Unforgettable
Oh oh oh
Unforgettable
