I walked down to the corner mart
To get myself a slice and coke
Thoughts so big inside my head
But my parents swore I'd end up broke

My favorite band on the radio
Telling me I should let go
But I don't think so
(Just get back to the studio)

It was in my eyes before I spoke
It was in my heart before I woke
Your picture saved on my screen
Oh how does a young boy dream?
How does a young boy-

It's death or it's life
Everyone tries to stay between
Scared what you'll find in your head
Is that what you mean?
The stories they told
The world opens and devours you
Guard every hope because you only have a few

The songs we sang breathed life in us
Before anyone even noticed
My heart was full as I said
"I'll play these songs until I'm dead"

You're never as alone as you will feel
Don't ever let them take the wheel
The doubt may come but it will go
You only have to make it to the next show
Just make it to the next show

It's death or it's life
Everyone tries to stay between
Scared what you'll find in your head
Is that what you mean?
The stories they told
The world opens and devours you
Guard every hope because you only have a few

I'm not scared anymore

It's the one promise I made to myself
It won't go away
Don't let it go away
