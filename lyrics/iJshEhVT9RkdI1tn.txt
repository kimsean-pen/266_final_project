When I look into your eyes
Then i realize
That all I need is you in my life
All I need is you in my life
'Cause I never felt this way about another
I never felt so good
Never felt this way about another
Never felt this way about another and it feels so good

When I look into your eyes
Then i realize
That all I need is you in my life
All I need is you in my life
'Cause I never felt this way about another
I never felt so good
Never felt this way about another
Never felt this way about another amd it feels so good

Memory of life
All I need is you in my life
All I need is you in my life
Cause I never felt this way about lovin'
Never felt so good
Never felt this way about loving
And it feels so
Good
when I look into your eyes
Memory of life
And all I need is you in my life
All I need is you in my life
Cause I've never this way about lovin'
Never felt so good
All I need is you
All I need is you
All I need is you
All I need is you
All I need is you in my life
All I need is you
All I need is you
All I need is you
All I need is you in my life
All I need is you in my life
