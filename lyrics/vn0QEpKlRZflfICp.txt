She's a rock
She's a rock
She's a rock

If I could find the words to talk about my woman
Well I would surely shout them out
But every time I feel my inspiration coming
It's all too much to talk about

'Cause she breaks me up
She takes me down
She sends my sideways
She with me every way I turn
If I'm back to school, she gotta be my favourite teacher
There's such a lot for me to learn

'Cause she's a rock (Yeah!)
Yes, she's a rock (Yeah!)
She's a rock (Yeah!)
She's a rock (Yeah!)

Somehow she always knows exactly what is needed
When I've been running round and round
And if she wants me, then I'll know that I've succeeded
I'll be heading back to town

'Cause she's a rock (Yeah!)
Yes, she's a rock (Yeah!)
Yes, she's a rock (Yeah!)
She's a rock (Yeah!)

Caesar rock
Caesar rock
Caesar rock
Caesar rock
She's a rock

Yeah, she's a, she's a, she's a, she's a, she's a
She's a, she's a, she's a, she's a, she's a
Yeah now she's a rock
(She's a rock)
Woohoo-hoo

She got loyalty
Like the royalty
She got symmetry
Anonymity

She got all the looks
She got all the looks
Got matching teeth
She got matching teeth!
