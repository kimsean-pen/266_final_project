The only thing I'm really sure of
I'm unsure of almost everything
But I'm looking up and looking forward
There's nothing back there for you or me

So you say you are
Broken, beaten
Used and mistreated
Tired, shattered
Bruised and battered
The only thing I'm really sure of
I'm unsure of almost everything
But I know, I know, I

I only wanna talk to you
I only wanna talk to you
I only wanna talk to you
I only wanna talk to you
I only wanna talk to you, now
I only wanna talk to
To you

You see, yesterday I said tomorrow
I learned today tomorrow can't be saved
And the less you know the more

You say you're
Broken, beaten
Used and mistreated
Tired, shattered
Bruised and battered
The only thing I'm really sure of
I'm unsure of almost everything
But I know, I know, I

I only wanna talk to you
I only wanna talk to you
I only wanna talk to you
(Ahhh)
I only wanna talk to you
I only wanna talk to you
I only wanna talk to you
To you
(Ahhh)

I will speak in cursive
About the way it was
When days were young
But now the clock talks so loud
Articulate and perfect
About the way it is
And we ain't kids
The clock, it always talks so loud
And did you know?
I only wanna talk to you, I

I only wanna talk to you
I only wanna talk to you
I only wanna talk to you
Oh, I only wanna talk
I only wanna talk to you
I only wanna talk to you
I only wanna talk to you
Talk to you, talk to you, oh
(Yeah)
I only wanna talk to you
