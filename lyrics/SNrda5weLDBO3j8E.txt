The waking took longer than the war 'tween my mind and my blood
And i'm not sure who wriggled out
I can't stop thinking:
Does politeness make it bearable?
Or is it just who we are?
And how much time, in a lifetime,
do we waste waiting at traffic lights?

It makes me sick but i can't remember the way i got here
Born in freedom
Raised in love
Grown an adult
Perishable hopes keep the vultures fat
And the one thing i know, they won't give them back

Not looking forward to the good old times
For i don't know how to keep all my shit together
I'm just a stack of photographs
I can't keep my shit together
And the older i get, the better i am
At forgetting names and faces
I first took these pictures with...

So, I wake up alone
Can't i play on my own?

And with the sun
I make faces to the first silhouettes haunting the streets i walk
Home. Sun. Concrete burns
Faces. Curse. Smile
Where the fuck will it end?

I guess it's just morning questions
No way my brain will shut up
I'm burning in a jail of doubts
It's not so easy to hide

I just don't know where it goes
I just don't know where it ends
I just don't hope I'm alone
Silence is a safe place
