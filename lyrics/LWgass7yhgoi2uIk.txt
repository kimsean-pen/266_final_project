I'll hold your hand
When you are feeling mad at me
When the monsters they wont go
The windows, they wont close
I'll pretend to see what you see

How long, I say how long
Will you re-live the things that are gone?
The devil's on your back
But I know you can shake him off

And every day that you want to waste
That you want to waste, you can
And every day that you want to wake up
That you want to wake, you can
And every day that you want to change
That you want to change, yeah
I'll help you see it through
'Cause I just really want to be with you

You know it's funny
How freedom can make us feel contained
When the muscles in our legs
Aren't used to all the walking
I know if you could snap both your fingers
Then you'd escape with me
But in the meantime I'll just wait here
And listen to you when you speak, or scream

And every day that you want to waste
That you want to waste, you can
And every day that you want to wake up
That you want to wake, you can
And every day that you want to change
That you want to change, yeah
I'll help you see it through
'Cause I just really want to be with you

The truth cuts us and pulls us back up
And separates the things that look the same
Then you can fight it off, you can fight it off, you can

And every day that you want to waste
That you want to waste, you can
And every day that you want to wake up
That you want to wake, you can
And every day that you want to change
That you want to change, yeah
I'll help you see it through
'Cause I just really want to be with you
