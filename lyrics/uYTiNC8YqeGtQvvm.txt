Legend of the Astral Hammer

Slashing my way through an army of goblins
On the dark side of the moon
Far overhead lunar dragons are swarming
My hammer will be their doom

Angus McFife XIII my name
Scion of mighty Dundee
Intergalactic great hero of steel
Ruler of whole galaxy

Wielding this ancestral weapon
The Hammer of Glory its name
The Kingdom of Fife will forever proclaim

Legend of the Astral Hammer
Forged in the heart of celestial fire
Legend of the Astral Hammer
Miniscule goblin, impractical sword
Legend of the Astral Hammer
Powered by lasers entwined in a star
Legend of the Astral Hammer
Crystal enchantment of steel

Eons ago, the star lord's descendant
Powerful [?]
With three epic weapons to safeguard from doom
Concealing them far cross the land

Relics of legend, relics of might
Fortunate army for time
For thousands of years, unfathomed, unknown
Deep in a mystical shrine

These emblem of ultimate fighter
Now battle a war in the stars
Defending the kingdom from demons of Mars

Legend of the Astral Hammer
Forged in the heart of celestial fire
Legend of the Astral Hammer
Miniscule goblin, impractical sword
Legend of the Astral Hammer
Powered by lasers entwined in a star
Legend of the Astral Hammer
Crystal enchantment of steel

Now Zargothrax rises once more
To threaten the force of the light
Assemble the heroes of steel
Prepare for the ultimate fight
