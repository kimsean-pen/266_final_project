I don't read the headlines
And I don't watch the news
'Cause silence faith in something every time I do
Well I don't mean to bury my head in the sand
But I'm just tryna live this life as best as I can

Times get tough, but I don't give up
'Cause I know I'm not alone

'Cause we're all reaching for something
We're all craving change
Hoping tomorrow tomorrow is better than today
We're all searching for some way
Trying to find a way
Hoping tomorrow tomorrow is better than today
Hoping tomorrow tomorrow is better than today

It's not easy sleeping
When I lay down the bed
'Cause I got all these worries running through my head
And its hard to keep pushing forward
When trouble pulls you back
And you wake up even further from a dream you had

Times get tough, but I don't give up
'Cause I know I'm not alone

'Cause we're all reaching for something
We're all craving change
Hoping tomorrow tomorrow is better than today
We're all searching for some way
Trying to find a way
Hoping tomorrow tomorrow is better than today
Hoping tomorrow tomorrow is better

So just hold on when someone breaks you
Just hold on when feelings shakes you
Just hold on when darkness change you
Just hold on...

'Cause we're all reaching for something
We're all craving change
Hoping tomorrow tomorrow is better than today

So let's keep searching for some way
We're gonna find a way
To make tomorrow tomorrow better than today
Let's make tomorrow tomorrow better than today
Let's make tomorrow tomorrow better than today
Let's make tomorrow tomorrow better than today
Let's make tomorrow tomorrow better than today
Let's make tomorrow tomorrow better than today
