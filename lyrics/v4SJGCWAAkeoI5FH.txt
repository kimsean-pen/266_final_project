Waiting by the mailbox, by the train
Passin' by the hills 'til I hear the name
I'm looking for a saw to cut these chains in half and all I want is
Someone to rely on as
Thunder comes a rolling down
Someone to rely on as
Lightning comes a staring in again
I'll wait to be forgiven
Maybe I never will
My star has left me
To take the bitter pill
That shattered feeling
Well the cause of it's a lesson learned
Just don't know if I could roll into the sea again
"Just don't know if I could do it all again" she said, it's true
Waiting in my room and i lock the door
I watch the coloured animals across the floor
And im looking from a distance
And im listening to the whispers
And oh it aint the same, when your falling out of feeling and your
Falling in and caught again
Ca-a-a-u-ght again
Im caught again in the mystery
Your by my side, but are you still with me?
The answers somewhere deep in it, im sorry but your feeling it
But i just have to tell that i love you so much these days
Have to tell you that i love you so much these days, its true
My heart is in economy
Due to this autonomy
Rolling in and caught again
Caught again
Ca-a-a-u-ght again
My heart is in economy
Due to this autonomy
Rolling in and caught again
Caught again
Ca-a-a-u-ght again
