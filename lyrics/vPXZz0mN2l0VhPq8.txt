I die to live
I live to love you endlessly
Your love is everything
My heart desires to feel

I lie awake at night
And dream of your return
Behind closed eyes
I see you just the way you were

The diamond shatters
And now I know
How much pain it causes
When you're gone
All I can wish now's a miracle
Miracle to reawake our love

Do you remember the night we met?
Will we ever be the same again?
Inside the fire with my regrets
Wish I could be born again tonight

The sleeping death
Waits in the silence of my woe
A touch from you is all it takes
To save my soon to be death soul

Love is a killer that never dies
Murdering its victim with delight
A long forgotten and sacrificed
Beggar in a barren paradise

Do you remember the night we met?
Will we ever be the same again?
Inside the fire with my regrets
Wish I could be born again tonight

Do you remember the night we met?
Will we ever be the same again?
Inside the fire with my regrets
Wish I could be born again tonight

Do you remember the night we met?
Will we ever be the same again?
Inside the fire with my regrets
Wish I could be born again tonight
Wish I could be born again
