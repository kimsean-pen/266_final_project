I think I'm in over my head here with you
Water creeping up the bed, seeping through
Loving you it ain't no day at the beach
Probably something 'bout your waist that got me weak
You told me not fall in love but here I am
Coming back to you again was not the plan
Barely coming up for air, what can I say?
Oh, baby, I go anyway, you take me
You pull me deep, both feet
I would drown for you loving, what's wrong with me?
I'm under water, don't wanna breath
I would drown for you loving and the repeat
You pull me deep (pull me deep), both feet (both feet)
I would drown for you loving, what's wrong with me?
I'm under water, don't wanna breath (no, no)
I would drown for your loving and then repeat
Baby, pull me deep, oh
It feels like I'm losing my breath once again
Saying you can tell me when I'm tryna swim
And I keep getting carried away with a tide
But as long as you by my side, I'll take a dive
You told me not to fall in love but here I am
Coming back to you again was not the plan
Barely coming up for air, what can I say?
Oh, baby, I go anyway, you take me
You pull me deep, both feet
I would drown for your loving, what's wrong with me?
I'm under water, don't wanna breath
I would drown for your loving and then repeat
You pull me deep (pull me deep), both feet (both feet)
I would drown for your loving, what's wrong with me?
I'm under water, don't wanna breath (no, no)
I would drown for your loving and then repeat
Baby, pull me deep, deep, deep, deep
I would drown for your loving now
Baby, pull me deep, deep, deep, deep
I don't wanna breath
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I would drown for your love
I would drown for your love
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I would drown for your love, ooh
You pull me deep (pull me deep), both feet (both feet)
I would drown for your loving, what's wrong with me?
I'm under water, don't wanna breath (no, no)
I would drown for your loving and then repeat
(I'd drown for your love)
You pull me deep (pull me deep), both feet (both feet)
I would drown for your loving, what's wrong with me?
(What's wrong with me?)
I'm under water, don't wanna breath (no, no)
I would drown for your loving and then repeat
Baby, pull me deep, deep, deep, deep
I would drown for your loving now
Baby, pull me deep, deep, deep, deep
I don't wanna breath
