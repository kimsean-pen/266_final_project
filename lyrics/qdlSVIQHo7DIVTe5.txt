What have we become? This massacre
What have we become? Eternal wasteland
Soon a memory of ash left behind...
Night sky, death awaits, fall to die

Lost and bound to never see the found, heed the words I say to you
Wondering into the black hole... Bite the hand before it's gone
Symbol's crash into the defeat, swallowing anguish, feel the decay
Feeling ceased, shaded eyes of deceit, they hold...

No where to be found
Feel defiance
Take away my innocence

Lost and bound to never see the found, heed the words I say to you
Wondering into the black hole... Bite the hand before it's gone

No where to be found
Feel defiance
Take away my innocence

To feel my warmth alone, as ash leaves my mouth to roam
I seal my warmth alone, as ash leaves my mouth to roam

Consume my body, devour my soul
Leave me bitter with no control
All hope is lost

Forsee the fallen God

The flower, the mountains, they cower as they fall, it dies
Night, the light, fallen to shadows, it dies
