Buried to my knees
I hope you find some sort of peace
In spite of me

Swinging blade that opens scars and more, comes around again
But you're not asking for a chance to pour out
Everything that hadn't been said but thought
Maybe I was holding you back from love
But we weren't anything

You used your head to get in mine

Buried to my knees
I hope you find some sort of peace
In spite of me
I wasted weeks
I know your perfect smile will never show its crooked teeth

The blade of love that I have now twists and turns in my back
Your friends say I'm at my worst, and you're my guiding light

If I die from all of this, know I won't be missed
The light has turned shade and I've been pushed away

Buried to my knees
I hope you find some sort of peace
In spite of me
I wasted weeks
I know your perfect smile will never show its crooked teeth

I've given up so write me off and I'll be gone
I'm watching you
I was too distant don't miss it
I'll be fine
I'm sorry that you had it all planned out

Buried to my knees
I hope you find some sort of peace
In spite of me
I wasted weeks
I know your perfect smile will never show its crooked teeth

Decay with me
Buried to my knees
I hope you find some sort of peace
In spite of me
