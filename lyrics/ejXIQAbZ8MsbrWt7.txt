At the airport terminal the planes are landing
Traveling somewhere and it feels fantastic
Rolling across the terminal floor

And the sky's so high and the ground's so low
And i think i'm dying but i'm just being born
At the airport terminal the plains are landing
Through the terminal we all shall go

At the airport terminal i feel so unusual
Everybody here is having an unusual day
It's 10:24 in an unusual time zone
And i'm feeling fine in an unusual way

And we're going so high as i'm flying so low
And i'm saying goodbye to the world i know
At the airport terminal the planes are landing
Thru the terminal we all can grow

And it's time to let go
But i'm lying down on the terminal floor
And i'm running toward the terminal door
And i'm eating porridge but i've
heated it for the wrong amount of time

At the airport terminal i feel so imaginative
Imagining where all the planes are going
When i'm there i'll imagine where i came from
Then i'll imagine my way back home

But it's 8:45 and i'm on the next flight
It's going around the world
And we'll flight through the night 'til the day becomes bright
Until the night returnes
When will the night return?

At the airport terminal the planes are landing
One day soon we'll all be together
Until then the terminal carries me through
