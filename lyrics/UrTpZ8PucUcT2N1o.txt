Sleepless nights, troubled mind
Love come save us in the nick of time
Take my hand, we've one last chance tonight

We're burning up, blown away
Honey like a desert day
But from your hands, take a drink I might

And nothing comes easy, no nothing at all
But if we believe it, we're a hundred foot tall

Riding high, feeling low
Never seen your eyes with a darker tone
Cause in your heart there's a missing part
I swear

Wish that I could tell you why
There's light up in the evening sky
But in the cold there's the freshest breath of air

And nothing comes easy, no nothing at all
But if we believe it, we're a hundred foot tall
Nothing comes easy, so baby come on
Whatever you're feeling, we can ride on

Riding high, feeling low
Never seen your eyes with a darker tone
Take my hand, we've one last chance tonight

And nothing comes easy, no nothing at all
But if we believe it, we're a hundred foot tall
Nothing comes easy, so baby come on
Whatever you're feeling, we can ride on
We can ride on
We can ride on
