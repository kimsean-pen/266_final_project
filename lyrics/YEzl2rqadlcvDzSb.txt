As they all felt the fire
They turned me into an outsider
I never heard from them again
So ironic when you called for a favor today

It's always easy to judge
But takes a lot to be specific
'cause as you preach you're opening the door
To your egos past

There was a day when I could forget
I could forgive but those days are gone
I see them fade

Filth runs in every new day

I learned to mute the anger
I never thought I would be there again
A moment, a dead end
I lost myself in here
I ran as I saw the end
Should I've joined the fight instead?
Hope you're listening
'cause now times have changed

I take a look around
Say this moment's mine
Flee all the weak minds
Feel my missed hidden rage
