Winter's city side
Crystal bits of snowflakes fall around my head and in the wind.
I had no illusions
That I'd ever find the glympse of summer heatwaves in your eyes

You did what you did to me
Now it's history I see
Here's my comeback on the road again
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight
It's easy when you're Big in Japan

You're Big in Japan
You're Big in Japan
You're Big in Japan
It's when
You're Big in Japan
Then I'll sleep by your side all through the night
Big in Japan
It's easy to be...

Neon on my skin
Passing silhouettes of strange illuminated mannequins
Shall I stay here at the zoo?
Should I go and change my point of view for other ugly scenes

You did what you did to me
Now it's history I see
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight
It's easy when you're Big in Japan

You're Big in Japan
You're Big in Japan
You're Big in Japan
It's when
You're Big in Japan
Then I'll sleep by your side all through the night
Big in Japan
It's easy to be...

I feel you'll see they way
Too late, too late... *scream*

You're Big in Japan
You're Big in Japan
You're Big in Japan
It's when
You're Big in Japan
Then I'll sleep by your side all through the night
Big in Japan
It's easy to be...

You're Big in Japan
Yeah and I'll sleep by your side all through the night
Big in Japan
It's easy to be...
You're Big in Japan
You're Big in Japan
You're Big in Japan
It's when
Big in Japan...
