No I can't believe what you said
Never gonna drop it
Try to tell me what you see
It's all that it's meant to be

One last chance to make this right but I know
That we're not really feeling the same
One last chance to teach you how to let go
'Cause I'm not gonna ask you to stay

Until next time I'll be thinking
What we could've been
Keep it in mind for another chance
I'll always be different, yeah
I'll always be different, yeah

One last chance to make this right but I know
That we're not really feeling the same
One last chance to teach you how to let go
'Cause I'm not gonna ask you to stay

You say I never lie
I'm only here to waste your time
I just need a little space
I'm gonna ask you to stay away

One last chance to make this right but I know
One last chance to teach you how to let go

One last chance to make this right but I know
That we're not really feeling the same
One last chance to teach you how to let go
Cause I'm not gonna ask you to stay

No I can't believe what you say
Never gonna drop it try to tell me what you see
It's all that it's meant to be
