You're the powder in my gun
When I shoot off my mouth
or get angry
With anyone

You're the flip-side of a frown
When I misbehave
You help me stand my ground
But the feeling
Overcomes my mind
Until I wanna die

But your teasing
Like a trembling to the heart
You bring me back to life

And you told me

"Get yourself together,
Let go of the past,
Take it easy."

"If we're good together,
We can make it last."

Then you sold me,

A chemical reaction
Triggered by your stare
Girl, I'll take you anywhere
Girl, I'll take you anywhere

I don't always need your help
But you're the only one
Who will let me be myself
You're my wife
I pass for two
Without our connection
I could never write this music for you

And you told me

"Get yourself together,
Let go of the past,
Take it easy."

"If we're good together,
We can make it last."

Then you sold me,

A chemical reaction
Triggered by your stare

Girl, I'll take you anywhere
Girl, I'll take you anywhere

And you told me

"Get yourself together,
Let go of the past,
Take it easy."

"If we're good together,
We can make it last."

Then you sold me,

A chemical reaction
Triggered by your stare

Girl, I'll take you anywhere
Girl, I'll take you anywhere
