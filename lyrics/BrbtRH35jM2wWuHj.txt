Heart Over Mind, Yes I'm
My Father's Son
I Live My Life, Just Like
My Father's Done
If He'd Told Me, One Day
That Somebody'd Have My Heart In Chains
Would I Believe It, No Way
Made Up My Mind I'd Never Fall That Way

But Tell Me Why
Everytime I Try, To Tell You It's Goodbye
I Can't Seem To Let Go
In My Heart
I Know I Want To Stay

What I'm Trying To Say
Heart Over Mind
Yes I'm My Father's Son
An I'm Inclined To Do

As My Father's Done
Here I Am With You
And I Know That It's True

Despite All The Feelings
Your Putting Me Through
I Try To Walk Away, Something Makes Me Stay
Heart Over Mind, Yes I'm
My Father's Son

I Live My Life, Just Like
My Father's Done
But Tell Me Why
Everytime I Try, To Tell You It's Goodbye

I Can't Seem To Let Go, In My Heart,
I Know I Want To Stay, What I'm Trying To Say
Heart Over Mind, Yes I'm
My Father's Son

I Live My Life, Just Like
My Father's Done
If He'd Told Me, One Day
That Somebody'd Have My Heart In Chains
Would I Believe It, No Way
Made Up My Mind, I'd Never Fall That Way
But Over Mind, Yes I'm My Father's Son
An I'm Inclined To Do
As My Father's Done
Heart Over Mind, Yes I'm
My Father's Son
