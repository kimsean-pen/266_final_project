How can I not taste it,
when it's right there put it in my hand.
And let's not put it in their faces.
Hide the obvious just a little bit,
It's coming to this.

You'll know they'll never face it,
They're just a face all covered with a rag.
And they can't stop talking,
so the bigger it gets.
And yeah they take up space but still nothing's wasted.

A lie is a lie with crossed hearts and hopes to die.
WooooOoooo,
You can find me underground,
where I can't hear a sound.
I watched you get down on your knees,
in hopes that I would turn around.
So now you'll find me underground,
where I can't hear a sound,
Where I can't hear a sound.

I tried hard to erase it.
I tried not to use it cause' I can.
And don't tell me what a race is,
Cause I can get fucked up more than a little bit
It's coming to this.

We pay to watch it wasted,
They're just a face all covered with a rag.
And they might keep running,
but the slower they move.
And those moves in time with their perfect placement.

A lie is a lie with crossed hearts and hopes to die.
Wowooo,
You can find me underground,
where I can't hear a sound.
I watched you get down on your knees,
in hopes that I would turn around.
So now you'll find me underground,
where I can't hear a sound,
where I can't hear a sound,
where I can't hear a sound.

What can I say,
I would have gone another way
cause that isn't me.
I was born to fade away.
It's nothing you did, just something I felt as a kid.
And now I can't feel
I can't feel anything at all.
It's nothing at all,
I feel nothing at all.
Nothing at all.

A lie is a lie with crossed hearts and hopes to die.
Wowooo,
You can find me underground,
where I can't hear a sound.
I watched you get down on your knees,
in hopes that I would turn around.
So now you'll find me underground,
where I can't hear a sound,
where I can't hear a sound.

Pulling my head!
