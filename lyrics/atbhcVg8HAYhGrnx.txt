What can only be found now?
it can only be only found now
did you find it? do you see it?
it can only be found now

as if
as if staring at a gravesite
until I become a grave sight/site
would it make me a still life?

as if
I knew what i knew
but i don't
so i do what i do
so i go with the flow
until I'm blue
as if the notion to know shit
could save no one from nothing
as if I make space saved for placelessness
and be pasted into my peaceful bliss
as if I'm displaced
in this place
is it this face?
within this grin?

how bout that?
how bout that?
I'll walk into the landscape
I won't come back

how bout that?
how bout that?
I'll walk into away

how bout?
how bout?
I walk into the distance
until I become the distance
would it make me the distance

how bout?
the still life with old shoes holds truth
deep in a blue mood with hues of gold sun views
it's the rear view and the real you
that haunt you
even here too, real soon
I'll walk away into a way of being
be it, I meant to mean it
reaching for meaning
but I'll wake up
I'm still Jacob
with still life
and self-love

How bout?
how bout that?
how bout that?
I'll walk into the landscape
I won't come back

how bout that?
how bout that?
I'll walk into away

how bout that?
How bout that?
How bout that? ...
