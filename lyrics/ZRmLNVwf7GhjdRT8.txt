Stealing from you everything you wanted
Pay the price in everything you do
Can't escape 'cause you are being haunted
Loving everything I stole from you

Falling, falling out of view
It's calling, calling all of you
You're damned if you do

Cast a spell and blind you to reflection
Seeing only what I want you to
There is nothing in me but deception
Believing everything I want you to

Falling, falling out of view
It's calling, calling all of you
You're damned if you do
(Do)
(Do)
