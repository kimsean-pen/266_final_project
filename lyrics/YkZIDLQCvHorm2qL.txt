Slide over here
In the setting sun
D-d-d-don't pull away
Till the day is gone
"Oh baby, what's over there?"
Oh baby, I can't say
But why do you care?
Only you can know...

Oh baby glide over here
On the setting sun
D-d-don't come unglued
Till the day is done
"Oh baby, what's going on?"
Oh baby, I can't say
But why do you care?
It's just you and me...

What over there?
Oh baby I can't say
Why don't you think to look away?
(Look or look away)
