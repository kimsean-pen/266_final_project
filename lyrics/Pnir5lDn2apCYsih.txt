This is not the time, the time to start a new love
This is not the time, the time to sign a lease
Try not to worry about what's forgotten
Try not to worry about what's being missed

Scars on my shins, scars on my knuckles
Today I woke up in the basketball court
John Joe's in Sydney and he ain't returning
I'm sitting in Soho trying to stay drunk

In any part of the world
From Silver Lake to Williamsburg
You can pick another stranger
And fall in love

This is not the time, the time to start a new love
This is not the time, the time to sign a lease
Try not to worry about what's forgotten
Try not to worry about what's being missed

Bleeding gums and v-veins protruding
You try to hate all of your clothes
The Mayor's in L.A. and she ain't returning
I'm sleeping with people I don't even like

In any part of the world
From Silver Lake to Williamsburg
You can pick another stranger
And fall in love

When I saw you last night, I wanted to say,
Run away with me, away from the cynics
That this could be the start of something truly real
But all that I could say was, hey?
Was, hey, was, hey, was, hey
