And don't tell me, i'm afraid of waking up alone
But it's waking up to find you've gone
But you make it clear,
I had my chances
Only one way left to go,
So i'll follow it down

She goes straight,
straight for the deep end
Doesn't hesitate to dive right in
Be careful now,
Be careful now

So shes traded my love for comfort,
Gives it all away
So much for that happy ending
Now you make it clear,
You've got your options
Only one way left to go,
So i'll follow it down

She can't hold her own!
Who would have known!

She is misery's company!
She got no place to go!
No place to call home!
She got misery's company!

She goes straight,
straight for the deep end
Doesn't hesitate to dive right in
Be careful now,
Be careful now,
Be careful!
Be careful now

She only come to me in my dreams,
So sleep becomes routine,
Its not healthy, its what make you right
Its not healthy, its what make you

She only come to me in my dreams,
So sleep becomes addicting,
Its not healthy, its what make you right
Its not healthy, its what make you

Hold her strings to haunt my dreams,
Its not healthy, its what make you right
Its not healthy, its what make you

She goes straight,
straight for the deep end
Doesn't hesitate to dive right in
She goes straight,
straight for the deep end
Doesn't hesitate to dive right in
Be careful now,
Be careful now,
Be careful!
