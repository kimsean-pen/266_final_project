The endless night is leading to you
I see your shadow in the dark
And wasted eyes of lonely strangers
Are getting me right through the arc

Bury dreams of mine
City of a glow
I feel you behind
Anywhere I go

Bury dreams of mine
City of a glow
I feel you behind
Anywhere I go
Anywhere I go

Night came as soon as I woke up
It's been so hard to forget her name
And cigarettes bring me to nothing
I had a soul 'till I got flame

Bury dreams of mine
City of a glow
I feel you behind
Anywhere I go

Bury dreams of mine
City of a glow
I feel you behind
Anywhere I go
Anywhere I go
Anywhere I go
Anywhere I go
Anywhere I go
