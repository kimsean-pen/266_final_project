You act like you are afraid of who you are

There's still hope for you.

One day you'll open your eyes, take a look inside
Cuz I just saved your life.
Just take a look inside
I hope you know what it's like for you to be alright.
I am for you.

Don't give up just believe cuz I will be right there
When your hopes and your dreams are on the line.
On the line
Don't give up just believe I'll be right by your side

When your hopes and your dreams are on the line.

I can save you
If you'd ask me, just ask me to.
