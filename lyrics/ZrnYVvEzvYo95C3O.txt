I come home in the morning light my mother says
"When you gonna live your life right?"
Oh mother dear we're not fortunate ones
Oh girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun

The phone rings in the middle of night my father yells
"What you gonna do with your life?"
Oh daddy did you know you still number one
But girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun

That's all we really want some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun

Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide them away from the rest of the world
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun
Oh girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun

That's all we really want some fun
When the working day is done
Oh girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun

They just wanna
They just wanna
They just wanna
They just wanna
They just wanna
They just wanna
They just wanna
They just wanna

When the working day is done
Oh Girls just wanna have fun
Oh Girls just wanna have fun
When the working day is done
Oh Girls just wanna have fun
Oh Girls just wanna have fun
