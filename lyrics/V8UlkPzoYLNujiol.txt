{This is a song about a superhero named Tony
It's called Tony's theme}
He's got the oil on his [incomprehensible]
For a ride in the rain
No baloney
Ride around on my bicycle like a pony
I'm waving hi, hi, hi
G-g-gimme, a scream
Give me, give me the theme
Of Tony
Tony, Tony, Tony
Tony
[incomprehensible] super bicycle [incomprehensible], I'm racing
Spitfire turn and pop a wheelie, burn evil chasing
I'm waving bye, bye, bye
I got a card in my spokes
I'm practicing my joke, I'm learning
Tony, Tony, Tony
Tony, Tony
{This is a song about a superhero named Tony
It's called Tony's theme}
I can look at the sun if you give me some bad sun glasses
I'm back on the road, I cut my grass like I'm told
After classes
Tony, Tony, Tony
