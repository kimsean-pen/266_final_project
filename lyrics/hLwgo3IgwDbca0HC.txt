troubles with the flowers problems in the mainland
all these conversations make me want to go mad
and go wild, to be wild
and go wild, for a while

building all this tension
pinching all the nerves down
need to pay attention
focus on you own plan
parole is over now, you can step outside
i think i want to start a fight
and go wild, to be wild
and go wild, for a while
and i'll destroy the fire desires the gun
and i'll destroy the fire desires the gun

all these conversations make me want to go mad
and go wild to be wild
and go wild for a while
and i'll destroy the fire desires the gun
