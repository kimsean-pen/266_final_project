She says that the world is a broken mess
And it's always on her mind
She cries at the news when the shots ring out
Oh, every single time

And no, I cannot fix it
No, I cannot make it stop
So I said hey, turn your phone off
Won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?
Oh, hey, turn your phone off
Won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?
She prays on her knees as the towers fall
To a God she does not know
She's begging Him to stop the mess
As the Boston bombs will blow
She says how can I ever believe
In something that would step aside and watch

And I got no words to say
'Cause I think I lost my faith
But I fake it for the day, oh, everything will be okay
But no, I cannot fix it
And I cannot make it stop
So I said hey, turn your phone off
Won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?
Oh, hey, turn your phone off
Won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?

I wish I had the answers
Something you could hold to
The only thing that's real to me...
Is you

Turn your phone off
Won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?
Oh, hey, turn your phone off
Won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?
Oh, hey

Real life, real life, oh, hey

Real life, real life, oh, hey
