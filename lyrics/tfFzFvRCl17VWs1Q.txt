Nine slaves of death - Trapped in eternal hell
Kill you with their breath - If you catch a smell
You've all will to live - Losing death
You are doomed to die - Smell the reapers of death

Fevered and delirious - Despairing dreams
Black shadow haunting you - It never leaves
Now you begin to feel unrelenting pain
Before your life is through your gone insane

Stiffening of the joints, death creeps in
Flesh is turning blue, the end begins
Screaming endlessly, until your death
Certain death comes at last
From the black breath
