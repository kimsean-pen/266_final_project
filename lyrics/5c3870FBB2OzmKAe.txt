A prayer for the switch blade doors
Stained glass in a count off shore
One hit make me want one more
Excess, no it don't come cheap
Want one 'cause it tastes so sweet
Kool-Aid in the city of dreams

And LA, LA, LA, LA isn't for everyone
We say, we say, we say, we say, we are the chosen ones

We're angels asleep on the floor
'Cause we partied too far
Drink holy water
Somebody's daughter
Angels and Gucci, we pray
Sell our souls for a taste
Drink holy water
Somebody's daughter

I'm Pablo and this cocaine
I'm high on power and fame
New friends and money to make
Bless up, I'm gonna go far
Hang out on the Boulevard
'Cause I wanna stare at the stars

And LA, LA, LA, LA isn't for everyone
We say, we say, we say, we say, we are the chosen ones

We're angels asleep on the floor
'Cause we partied too far
Drink holy water
Somebody's daughter
Angels and Gucci, we pray
Sell our souls for a taste
Drink holy water
Somebody's daughter

Cherry wine run away
Rum and coke set me straight
West Coast all the way down
Louis V, lingerie
Smoking weed on holiday
West Coast all the way down

And LA, LA, LA, LA isn't for everyone
We say, we say, we say, we say, we are the chosen ones

We're angels asleep on the floor
'Cause we partied too far
Drink holy water
Somebody's daughter
Angels and Gucci, we pray
Sell our souls for a taste
Drink holy water
Somebody's daughter

We're angels asleep on the floor
'Cause we partied too far
Drink holy water
Somebody's daughter
Angels and Gucci, we pray
Sell our souls for a taste
Drink holy water
Somebody's daughter
