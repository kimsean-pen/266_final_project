In the year of the tiger, I won't weep and moan
Got no time for cooling heels, I've got to roam
In the year of the tiger, I'm gonna roll these bones
Gonna leave behind the heartache that I've known

The only love I've known has slipped away
The only love I've known has gone away

In the year of the tiger, I'm gonna stake my claim
Run a thousand miles beyond this house of pain
In the year of the tiger, I got my kin to save
And I'll be damned to see them suffer one more day

On a cold, cruel July
We didn't know just when the pale horse would arrive
But love alone keeps us alive
When we fear we can't go on at all

In the year of the tiger, I heard a nightmare scream
Cut above the din of every future dream
In the year of the tiger, well, you'd best believe
I am haunted by the visions that I've seen

On a cold, cruel July
We didn't know just when the pale horse would arrive
But love alone keeps us alive
When we fear we can't go on at all
Can't go on at all

In the year of the tiger, into an ocean grave
Threw his ashes to the wind then walked away
In the year of the tiger, I got no time to waste
A resolution to keep fighting and remain

On a cold, cruel July
We didn't know just when the pale horse would arrive
But love alone keeps us alive
When we fear we can't go on at all
Can't go on at all

In the year of the tiger
In the year of the tiger
In the year of the tiger
In the year of the tiger
