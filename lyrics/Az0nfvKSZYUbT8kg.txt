It was a day just like this
In a life of our times
Shruggin' signs there's no chance for us
It's not mine to decide

You never listened to what I said
You never thought I'd succeed, well
And though I've given you all I can
You show no faith in me

And I remember and I recall
And I can see that nothing's changed at all
Though we falter, we don't have to fall
And I can see that nothing's changed at all

Even when I was young, oh
And the pressure was on, yeah
You always told me to do my thing
So what the hell went wrong

And I remember and I recall
And I can see that nothing's changed at all
Yeah though we falter, we don't have to fall
And I can see that nothing's changed at all

An outcast comin' home, opinions stay the same
They'll spit them out and spin me right back through the door
The louder that we scream, the more invisible we seem
Is it gonna last forever, yeah

You don't have to fall
You can change at all
Is it gonna last forever, forever

Now, now I'm learning the lies, oh
From the skies where they reign
Can't find shelter for myself
And you're all to blame

And I remember and I recall
And I can see that nothing's changed at all
Yeah though we falter, we don't have to fall
And I can see that nothing's changed at all

And I remember and I recall
And I can see that nothing's changed at all
Yeah though we falter, we don't have to fall
And I can see that nothing's changed at all

And I remember and I recall
And I can see that nothing's changed at all
Yeah though we falter
