So you've got your own little story to tell
Some girls they ask to put them on your knees
Slowdown, it's hard enough to get along
Slowdown, we'll never ever get along
That ain't what you had in mind
No that ain't what you had in mind
You don't know what you're doing

Let go
It's so hard to fill me in
You'd better run as fast as you can
When your eyes are getting low
Tomorrow'll say if you're lost and found

Walking around thinking the same again
To get to you I'll go down on my knees
Last night I swear it wouldn't be the same
Last night I swear it never was the same
Two is for a while but then one has got to leave
That's it!
I ain't lying and I won't ask you please
I'll tell you what I have in mind

Let go
It's so hard to fill me in
You'd better run as fast as you can
When your eyes are getting low
Tomorrow'll say if you're lost and found

I'll tell you what I have in mind
It's so hard to fill me in
You'd better run as fast as you can.
