We are ordinary people
We all live different lives
In the end we're pretty much the same
We're just living in different lives
We must live in different lives
We must live in different lives
Say scream

You scream
I scream
We scream
But no one listens
This abuse to feel superior
Isn't working for
The only scream
You scream

I scream

We scream
Abuse to feel superior

Isn't working for you
We are ordinary people
In a world build of rest
Were we build mortal realms
We end up in a mist
We end up in a mist

We always end up in a mist
Say scream

You scream

I scream
We scream

But no one listens
This abuse to feel superior
Isn't working for
The only scream
You scream
I scream
We scream
Abuse to feel superior
Isn't working for you
We must live in different lives
We must live in different lives
Say scream
You scream
I scream
We scream
But no one listens
This abuse to feel superior
Isn't working for
The only scream
You scream
I scream
We scream
Abuse to feel superior
Isn't working for you
