My skin still burns
At all the places you've touched
So aware
You leave no place for hiding
Not last night
Not this time

I close my eyes, so the world can't see me
And draw the silhouette of a dancer in my head
I can't look through your eyes
But my mind betrays mine
Should I starve unmarked
Or confess to my blindness?

My eyes still hurt
Fighting chasing, chasing lights
As they form
Silhouettes behind me
Let them go
This time

Waiting for a change
I can't fight these chains of everyday
I bleed to avoid the pain
Every day I fade
Fade a little more

I close my eyes, so the world can't see me
And draw the silhouette of a dancer in my head
I can't look through your eyes
But my mind betrays mine
Should I starve unmarked
Or confess to my blindness?
