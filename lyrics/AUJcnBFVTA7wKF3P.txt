People say I'm crazy
Doin' what I'm doin'
Well, they give me all kinds of warnings
To save me from ruin

When I say that I'm okay
Well, they look at me kinda strange
Surely you're not happy now
You no longer play the game

People say I'm lazy
Dreamin' my life away
Well, they give me all kinds of advice
Designed to enlighten me

When I tell them that I'm doin' fine
Watchin' shadows on the wall
Don't you miss the big time, boy?
You're no longer on the ball

I'm just sittin' here watchin' the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll
No longer ridin' on the merry-go-round
I just had to let it go

People askin' questions
Lost in confusion
Well, I tell them there's no problem
Only solutions

Well, they shake their heads
And they look at me as if I've lost my mind
I tell them there's no hurry
I'm just sittin' here doin' time

I'm just sittin' here watchin' the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll
No longer ridin' on the merry-go-rounds
I just had to let it go
I just had to let it go
I just had to let it go
