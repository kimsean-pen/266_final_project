We sit with the fools and the sinners, the jokers and the killers it's just our way.
Toss a rock and you break a window, toss a feather up and watch the wind blow it away.

And you can float on the wind for so long, but someday honey you've got to come back down.
And when you do, ill be hangin around.

It smells like smoke in here, and the piano doesn't play it never did.
There's this feeling I get, when you're in the room I want you to stay.

And you can float on the wind for so long, but someday honey you've got to come back down.
And when you do, ill be hangin around.

Be good to your mothers, they did the best they could.
Bleed for your brothers, lord know that they would.
