The moment I said it
The moment I opened my mouth
Letting your eyelids
Bulldoze the life out of me
I know what you're thinking
But darling, you're not thinking straight
Sadly, things just happen we can't explain

It's not even light out
But you've somewhere to be
No hesitation
No, I've never seen you like this
And I dont like it, I dont like it
I don't like it at all

Just put back the car keys
Or somebody's gonna get hurt
Who are you calling at this hour?
Sit down, come round, I need you now
We'll work it all out together
We're getting nowhere tonight
Now sleep, I promise it'll all seem better - somehow
In time

It's not even light out
Suddenly, suddenly
Oh, you've somewhere to be
No hesitation
Mmm, I've never seen you like this
You're scaring me, you're scaring me
You're scaring me to death

Don't! Oh, (smash...) please-
Don't! Oh, (And another one) please?
Don't! Oh, (smash...) please-
Don't! Oh, (And another one) please?

I'm losing you

I'm losing you
Trust me on this one
I've got a bad feeling
Trust me on this one
You're going to throw it all away
With no hesitation
(Smash...)
