We're given a garden,
And gave back a parking lot
We got about fifteen minutes to go

Before this audience starts
Throwing tomatoes, yeah!
It's not the end, there is more show!
We got about fifteen minutes to go!

Survived the plague
Floated the flood
Just peeked our heads above the mud
No one's immune
Deafening bells,
My God, will we survive ourselves!?

I'm not an alarmist
But someone should break the glass
And pull that red T-lever down!

To get their attention
Start lobbing the Light Grenades
That burst and blind them with the truth,
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth

Survived the plague
Floated the flood
Just peeked our heads above the mud
No one's immune
Deafening bells,
My God, will we survive ourselves

Survived the plague
Floated the flood
Just peeked our heads above the mud
Wipe off your face, we've come this far
Come on, remember who you are

Survived the plague
Floated the flood
Just peeked our heads above the mud
No one's immune
Deafening bells,
My God...
(clap clap clap - ahh)

Survived the plague
Floated the flood
Just peeked our heads above the mud
Wipe off your face, we've come this far
Come on, remember who you are

Come on! Remember who you are
Come on! Remember who you are
Remember! Remember!
Come on! Remember who you are
Remember! Remember!
Come on! Remember who you are
