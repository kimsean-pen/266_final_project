i took my shoes off
crawled into bed
thought i had nothing left
and i got his number
in january
it was so freezing
i am ruined best when i am cold

and my???
and i was left alone
i just needed someone who would appreciate the growth?
and i can remember the last time i enjoyed the snow

now i hold my own hands in crowds of bands and my friends
jan always says to me you gotta be your own 3am
