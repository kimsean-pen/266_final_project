Here we are looking at the sun
Nothing's gonna change
All strung out beached upon the shore
You said I don't ever want to change no more

We spent all our nights drinking Patrón
Under shocking festive skies
All those finer friends they were out of control
In your hilltop paradise
Go again
The party never ends

Basquiat's hanging on the wall
Sugar that is at your beck and call
It wears me out but we do it all again
I love the way you walk into the room and set it off

We spent all our nights drinking Patrón
Under shocking festive skies
All those finer friends they were out of control
In your hilltop paradise

Always dance with the devil under pale moonlight
Ever faced up to the fear?
You must try some love and you never give in
But the view looks good from here

Sorry until
Another lost weekend
Trading all the blows
The party never ends
The party never ends

The party never ends
The party never ends
The party never ends
