I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying 'hey oh'
Gotta let go
Now I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying 'hey oh'
Baby, let's go

I came to dance, dance, dance, dance
I hit the floor
'Cause that's my plans, plans, plans, plans
I'm wearing all my favorite brands, brands, brands, brands
Give me space for both my hands, hands, hands, hands, hands

You, you

'Cause it goes on and on and on...
And it goes on and on and on...

I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying 'hey oh'
Gotta let go
Now I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying 'hey oh'
Baby, let's go

'Cause we gon' rock this club,
We gon' go all night,
We gon' light it up,
Like it's dynamite

'Cause I told you once,
Now I told you twice,
We gon' light it up
Like it's dynamite

I'm gonna take it all... like
I'm gonna be the last one standing
I'm over it all... like
I'm gonna be the last one landing
Because I, I, I, believe it
And I, I, I

I just want it all
I just want it all
I'm gonna put my hands up in the air
Hands in the air
Put your hands up in the air

Uh...
Come on...
Ooh...

I throw my hands up in the air sometimes,
Saying 'hey oh'
Gotta let go
Now I wanna celebrate and live my life,
Saying 'hey oh'
Baby, let's go

'Cause we gon' rock this club,
We gon' go all night,
We gon' light it up,
Like it's dynamite

'Cause I told you once,
Now I told you twice,
We gon' light it up
Like it's dynamite!
Like it's dynamite!
