Hey there, shadow
Didn't seem to care at all when you watched me go
I know young love is just a dream
You were only 17 but you're the only love I've known.

So please just let me go, if you're done
'Cause it's hope that kills this heart
So please set me free
Kill the spark.

I've been gone
From this world for what seems like millennia
Looking for nothing short of a miracle
I only ever wanted to come home
Please won't you let me go
When I have no one left I can run away
Will you lie to me; tell me I'll be okay?
Close my eyes and lay me in my tomb
Now pull the trigger and send me home

So how did I get so far from my yesterday?
Another broken heart, now just a memory
I should have left you in the dark
I should have left this awful town and never found out how to love

So why do I not know about the things that you regret?
Now that we're dead, and over and done.
Get away from me
And leave my heart under the rug.

I've been gone
From this world for what seems like millennia
Looking for nothing short of a miracle
I only ever wanted to come home
Please won't you let me go
When I have no one left I can run away
Will you lie to me; tell me I'll be okay?
Close my eyes and lay me in my tomb
Now pull the trigger and send me home

So send me home.

I've been gone
From this world for what seems like millennia
Looking for nothing short of a miracle
I only ever wanted to come home
So won't you let me go
When I have no one left I can run away
Will you lie to me; tell me I'll be okay?
Close my eyes and lay me in my tomb
Now pull the trigger and send me
