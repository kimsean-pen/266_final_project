You, you light up in the dark
You're the glowing in a priceless work of art, oh
I see, I see a shining star
You're the light through my window from afar, oh

And don't you forget
The only thing that matters is your heartbeat going strong
Oh, don't you forget
That nothing else can matter 'cause you know where I belong

Oh, take me there
Won't you take me there?
Won't you take me home?

Oh, take me there
Won't you take me there?
Won't you take me home?

We, we light up the sky, oh
Heaven knows there's no such thing as goodbye, oh
'Cause love, love can never die (Love can never die)
We'll forever be burning, you and I, oh

And don't you forget
The only thing that matters is our heartbeats going strong
Oh, don't you forget
That nothing else can matter cause we know where I belong

Oh, take me there
Won't you take me there?
Won't you take me home?

Oh, take me there
Won't you take me there?
Won't you take me home?

Oh, take me there
Won't you take me there?
Won't you take me home?

Oh, take me there
Won't you take me there?
Won't you take me home
