the sun don't shine 'round here no more
and i know it won't be long
i hope i see you out tonight
and i hope we get it on

'cuz i'm ready, i'm ready
to love somebody
'cuz i'm ready, i'm ready
let's go

whatever you heard about me before
believe me, theings ain't what they were
whenever you look at me or talk to me
you sound just like her

and i'm ready, i'm ready
to love somebody
'cuz i'm ready, i'm ready
to love somebody

seldom seen and in between
and i know it won't be long
bittersweet is evergreen
until we get it on

now i'm ready...
