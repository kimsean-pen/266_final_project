Born on a lonely planet full of broken dreams
Where no one understands me
When I finally met an angel, I didn't know what to say
She just held my hand
And we would lay awake at night, looking at the stars
Thinking of the ones we've lost, and wonder where they are
When we lit another candle, she asked me who's to blame
Then she put her arms around me and held me to the flame

So why do we hurt each other?
We don't need the words for one another's

Prayers, they don't mean a thing at all
Do they answer when you call?
These prayers, when you don't mean what you say
Would you die for me today? Now I just can't relate

None of this makes sense in this reality
God just leaves the room when I turn on my TV
I see a little girl who's crying 'cause she lost her family
All these strangers sending thoughts and prayers, she's buried underneath

Why do we kill each other?
We can't feel the pain in one another's

Prayers, they don't mean a thing at all
Do they answer when you call?
These prayers, when you don't mean what you say
Would you die for me today? Now I just can't relate

We're so far away from one another
We keep building walls between each other's

Prayers, they don't mean a thing at all
Do they answer when you call?
These prayers, when you don't mean what you say
Would you die for me today? Now I just can't relate

Prayers, they don't mean a thing at all
Do they answer when you call?
These prayers, when you don't mean what you say
Would you die for me today?
