I heard you say, meet you in the long grass
Something good at long last, and we're away
Next to me, found you by the old tree, something we can both see
And we're away

Oh let's run away and not know where we're going to
Let's go for today and it's all going to be wonderful

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Far away, find us in the future, something in your nature
And we're away
What d'you say, meet you by the seaside, somewhere we can both hide
And we're away

Oh let's run away and not know where we're going to
Let's go for today and it's all going to be wonderful
Oh let's run away and not know where we're going to
Let's go for today and it's all going to be fine
Oh, oh, oh
