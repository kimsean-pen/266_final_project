Walkin' through the city lookin' oh so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashin' all their legs and lashes
I've just got to find my way

Goin' to see me crawlin'
Through the bushes with it open wide
What you seein' girl?
Can't you, can't you believe it?
Can't you believe it?
Can't you believe your eyes?
It' s the real thing girl

Got me feelin' myself and reelin' around
Got me talkin' but feel like stalkin' around

Got me feelin' myself and reelin' a
Got me talkin' but nothing's with me and
Got me feelin' myself and reelin' around

Walkin' through the city lookin' oh so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashin' all their legs and lashes
I've just got to find my way

Goin' to see me crawlin'
Through the bushes with it open wide
What you seein' girl?
Can't you, can't you believe it?
Can't you believe it?
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing girl
Got me feelin' myself and reelin' around
Got me talkin' but feel like walkin' around
