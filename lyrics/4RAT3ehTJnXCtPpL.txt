You couldn't wait for answers
You just had to try those wings
And all your happy ever-afters...
They didn't mean a thing
So I'm not gonna try at all
To keep you from the flame
Just remember not to call... my name...

When you cry wolf
Once too often
You cry wolf
No, I won't come kockin'
You cry wolf
I won't hear you anymore

If you start to stumble
If you start to crack
If you're feeling humble...
Don't look back

When you cry wolf
Once too often
Yu cry wolf
No, I won't come knockin'
You cry wolf
I won't hear you anymore

You can try but you can't get me...
Into the fire
'Cause I'm all out of sympathy...
And, baby, I can't walk this wire

Find yourself somebody new
To catch you when you fall
'Cause I got just one thing to say to you
And, baby, that's all...

When you cry wolf
Once too often
You cry wolf
No, I won't come knockin'
You cry wolf
I won't hear you...
You cry wolf
Well, once too often
You cry wolf
Well, No I won't come knockin'
You cry wolf
I won't see you...
So you cry wolf
Once too often
Cry wolf
Oh no, I won't come knockin'
If you cry wolf...
I won't see you...
'Cause you cried wolf...
