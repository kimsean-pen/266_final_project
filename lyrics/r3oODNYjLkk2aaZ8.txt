Glory, glory
This is not another story
This is not another drill
I refuse to be another number, now
Never staying down
This is something real

I'm a name that you'll remember
I am more than just a thrill
I am gonna be the greatest ever, now
Watch out
I'm a force that you will fear

And it goes something like
(Oh-ohh-oh) I'm victorious
(Oh-ohh-oh) It's my time
(Oh-ohh-oh) There's no stopping this
'Cause I was born for this

I do it for the glory
I do it for the glory

I'll be more than just a fable
I'll be written in the stars
I will never be too afraid to bleed
Giving up on me
Even when it's hard
Oh, I started as an ember
Who was never carelessly
Now I'm raging like a fire
Burning up through everything I see

And it goes something like
(Oh-ohh-oh) I'm victorious
(Oh-ohh-oh) It's my time
(Oh-ohh-oh) There's no stopping this
'Cause I was born for this

I do it for the glory
I do it for the glory
I do it for the glory
I do it for the glory

When all is left is dust
They'll remember
Oh, they'll remember us

I do it for the...
I do it for the glory
I do it for the glory
I do it for the glory
I do it for the glory
