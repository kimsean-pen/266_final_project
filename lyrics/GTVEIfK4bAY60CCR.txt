You could be a changed man if you wanted
You could make the doves cry if you wanted
Tell me that you wanna die but you don't
Tell me that you wanna die but you don't

I say I'm sorry, but you're never sober
I start drinkin', it's too much thinkin', oh
It's the same every time that you're with me

I think I need some fresh air
Feelin' under pressure
Don't wanna talk about it
Don't even get me started
Over you
You know I ain't tryna go pressure you

You and me got differences, differences
You and me got differences
Why you want some different shit?
You and me got differences, differences
You and me got differences
Why you want some different shit?

Caught in the cyclone
It's a part of my cycle
Could've been right though
Guess that's how life go
Ain't nothin' more I can do for you

I think I need some fresh air
Feelin' under pressure
Don't wanna talk about it
Don't even get me started
Over you
You know I ain't tryna go pressure you

I think I need some fresh air
Feelin' under pressure
Don't wanna talk about it
Don't even get me started
Over you
You know I ain't tryna go pressure you

You and me got differences, differences
You and me got differences
Why you want some different shit?
You and me got differences, differences
You and me got differences
Why you want some different shit?
Why you want some different shit?

You could be a changed man if you wanted
You could make the doves cry if you wanted
Tell me that you wanna die but you don't
Tell me that you wanna die but you don't
