I feel you

I feel you, in every stone
In every leaf of every tree
That you ever might have grown

I feel you, in every thing
In every river that might flow
In every seed you might have sown

I feel you
I feel you
I feel you, in every stone
In every leaf of every tree
That you ever might have grown

I feel you, in every thing
In every river that might flow
In every seed you might have sown

I feel you
I feel you
I feel you

I feel you
I feel you, in every vein
In every beatin' of my heart
Each breath I take

I feel you, anyway
In every tear that I might shed
In every word I've never said

I feel you
I feel you
I feel you

I feel you
I feel you, in every vein
In every beatin' of my heart
In every breath I'll ever take
I feel you, anyway
In every tear that I might shed
In every word I've never said
I feel you
I feel you
I feel you
I feel you
I feel you
I feel you
