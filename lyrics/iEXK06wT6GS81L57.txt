In a bottle of noodles
I found a small green fish
Who told a fish story
He could grant me any wish
"OK!" I said, "That sounds great
I think I understand"
The fish rolled up his sleeves
And said "Your wish is my command"

I want a box of gold
And a palace of pearls
A nice big pool for my sad-eyed girls
I want a car that can fly
And X-Ray eyes
I'd wish for more wishes
cause it can't get better than this!

So there it was, that's it!
I can quit my job
I've got better things to do all day
cause in my spare time
I'm in a Rock n' Roll band
And in my full time
I just sit and wait

For my box of gold
And my palace of pearls
A nice big pool for my sad-eyed girls
For the car that can fly
for my X-Ray eyes
I'd like more wishes
cause it can't get better than this!

I can do anything
cause I'm wishing for everything!
It could happen
it could happen
Will it be?
You tell me?
Does it get much better than this?

When I woke up
I found the bottle was gone
Someone took it away
i guess I'll just have to wait

For my box of gold
And my palace of pearls
A nice big pool for my sad-eyed girls
For the car that can fly
for my X-Ray eyes
I wish I had more wishes
cause it didn't get better than this!

I can do anything
cause I'm wishing for everything!
It could happen
it could happen
Will it be?
You tell me?
Does it get much better than this?
