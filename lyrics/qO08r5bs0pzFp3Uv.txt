It took some time to realize
All the bullshit in my eyes
Until I got away from you
And then I guess you thought that you'd be cool
And make me look like I'm the one the fool
Well I don't care, 'cause you're the one to blame

I can't believe it all comes down to this
A penny for your thoughts would make me sick
And anything less would be a crime
Told me, told you
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Told me, told you
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up

Well, everything is not ok
Tomorrow's another day
I'll find my perfect way out
And then I guess you thought that you'd be smooth
And make me look like I'm another fool
Well I don't care, 'cause I don't believe anything you say or do

I can't believe it all comes down to this
A penny for your thoughts would make me sick
And anything less would be a crime
Told me, told you
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Told me, told you
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up

Just like me!
I cut my losses to save face
I've found my perfect space
To crawl back inside of myself
And then I guess you tried to make me be
Everything you wanted me to be
Well look up from the ground and see who's laughing last

I can't believe it all comes down to this
A penny for your thoughts would make me sick
And anything less would be a crime
I do what it takes to pull me through
No thanks to anything that you could do
Never trust again!
Told me, told you
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Told me, told you
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
