Well take a step outside your house
Have a look around it's all the same to me
Tiny places hold for you many memories that only you describe

New (x7)

It's going to take awhile to change
And get used to the journeys home on stormy nights
Weekends never far away you two can always come to stay
It's all alright

New (x7)

And all this in different houses
We'll all get what we wish that we pray for
And all this in different houses
We'll all get
We'll all get
We'll all get
We'll all get
