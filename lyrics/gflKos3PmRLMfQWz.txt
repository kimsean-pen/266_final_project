Caught up in the rhythm, push pause and restart
Turn off the news and the mood is dire
Head spinning, I give up the fight, I'm so tired
Wake up, push pause and restart
Hit snooze while my room's on fire
Still dreaming while my sheets ignite, I'm so tired

Maybe I'll put it out in another life, but now the smoke is filling up my lungs
And since the flames are getting higher, I'll embrace it 'til it's done

My world is anything but sane
Just me and all my problems
Just me and all my shame
My world is anything but sane
Wish everything would blossom
Wish everything would change
I wish everything would change

Back to the beginning, push pause and restart
Behind the wheel and the gauge is rising
No tread and the brakes are shot, that's it
I'll get it fixed in another life, but now
The ground's above me and my vision starts to cloud
At least the radio's still playing, but my song is fading out

My world is anything but sane
Just me and all my problems
Just me and all my shame
My world is anything but sane
Wish everything would blossom
Wish everything would change
I wish everything would change

Scatter my ashes along the coast, or don't, I don't even care
I have no wishes left in my head or heart, I'll meet you in hell

Yeah, this is where we belong
Yeah, this is where we belong
Yeah, this is where we belong
Yeah, this is where we belong

My world is anything but sane
Just me and all my problems
Just me and all my shame
My world is anything but sane
Wish everything would blossom
Wish everything would change
I wish everything would change

I wish everything would change
