Sipping my mornin' coffee
It tastes like we're together
Sublime it gettin' softly
Their mind and their hand and letter
I don't know what future holdin'
And how I'm about to call on
Waitin' and movin' slowly
just hope he was not the only

No love (No, no love)
I made the promise
No love (No, no)
No cryin' or worries
No love (No, no love)
I made the promise
No love (No, no)
No cryin' or worries

I hear him in every whisper
In every confounding moment
Breathe him all through the distance
Gets harder for me to ignore it
I'm comin' so close to rememberin'
The manners of men surround him
Vanish behind the setting
I swear that will never happen

No love (No, no love)
I made the promise
No love (No, no)
No cryin' or worries
No love (No, no love)
I made the promise
No love (No, no)
No cryin' or worries

No love (No, no love)
I made the promise
No love (No, no)
No cryin' or worries
No love (No, no love)
I made the promise
No love (No, no)
No cryin' or worries
