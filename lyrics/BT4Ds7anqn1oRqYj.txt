She sits and she waits by the tree
And she thinks no one comes to me
Heard it before

She stands there all alone
Staring blank at her telephone
But she's sure, so sure

Come away with me, baby
Join me in my car
We can go real far away
Away from here

She wants to know his name
Wants his wealth, but not his fame
Watch your pride

He sees it way down low
Way down where he doesn't go
Down inside, inside

Come away with me, baby
Join me in my car
We can go real far away
Away from here

And I'll show you the way, to my heart
Won't you come find me, you come find all the way at the start
Don't try and say, dont try to explain that you'll bide your time
Well I said run, though I said run but all you do is hide

Come away with me, baby
Join me in my car
We can go real far away
Away from here

(There anywhere you want to go I'll take you there
Oh, we can go
Out of your mind)
