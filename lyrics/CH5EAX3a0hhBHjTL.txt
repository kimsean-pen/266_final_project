I know that the damage is already done,
There's no going back,
I would have never guessed we'd come to this!
I know that it hurt to turn you away,
And I know all that I was wrong.

[Chorus:]
You're raging inside
And the being denied,
Waited too long for the feeling to die!
It's something this broken ever gonna fix?
If you ask me this question I would ever have guessed.

I know that it hurt, to turn you away,
And I know all that I was wrong!

[Chorus:]
You're raging inside
And the being denied,
Waited too long for the feeling to die!
It's something this broken ever gonna fix?
If you ask me this question I would ever have guessed.
