This girl just turned another bottle upside down
She'll point a finger at her father who was never around
Replaced her heart and passion
Now she's all nicotine and fashion
We hate to admit, looks like the old you is gone

(Hey) We're scared you'll die all alone
Your friends you've disowned
Just want you to know that we don't believe you
You can't be happier with him (let's go)

Now it seems the worst part is all the wasted potential we see in you
The way stage dives and sing alongs molded the mind you call your own
But we guess you'd rather sink than swim

(Hey) We're scared you'll die all alone
Your friends you've disowned
Just want you to know that we don't believe you
You can't be happier with him (let's go)

I know it's coming out wrong but just remember that
This is the only way (that I can honestly) Please come back home
We'll burn these city lights as bright as they can go
In the hopes that you that you will return
Just please come back home
You'll be met with open arms

(Hey) We're scared you'll die all alone
Your friends you've disowned
Just want you to know that we don't believe you
You can't be happier with him (let's go)

Please come back home
We'll burn these city lights as bright as they can go
In the hopes that you that you will return
