Next stop, I'm waiting for the train
Next stop, I was looking in the rain
Next stop, I'm missing you, goodbye
Next stop, tears in your eyes
'Til next time, ahh
'Til next time, ahh

Next stop, you're still the same as you used to be
Next stop, you're still the same as you used to be
That's alright, you're still the same as you used to be
'Til next time, ahh
'Til next time, ahh

Next stop, I'm waiting for the train
Next stop, I was looking in the rain
Next stop, I'm missing you, goodbye
Next stop, tears in your eyes
'Til next time, ahh
'Til next time, ahh

'Til next time, ahh
'Til next time, ahh
