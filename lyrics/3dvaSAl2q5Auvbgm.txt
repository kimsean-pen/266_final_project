Water
Walking
Walking on water
Walking
Walking on for years and years and years
Taking it into my head
Living by the right lines
Reading what the very man said

Water
I'm walking
Walking on
Water
Walking
Walking on

Lying on eleven years
Taking it into my head
Mary mary drunk it soft
Living reading what your very man said
Lying on eleven years
Taking it into my head
Leave my clothes on the beach
I'm walking down into the sea

To prove it to me
To prove it to me
To prove it to me

Now the water to my ankles
Now the water to my knees
Think of him all waxy wings
Melted down into the sea
Mary mary what your man said
Washing it all over my head
Mary mary hold on tightly
Over water
Under the sea

Water
Water
I'm walking
Walking on
Water
Walking
Walking on
Water
Walking
Walking on
Water
Walking
Walking on
