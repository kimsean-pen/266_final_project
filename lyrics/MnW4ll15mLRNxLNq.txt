I tell you something isn't right
The way i'm feeling kept me up all night
I fix myself another drink
I guess that's crazy i need time to think
And all the good ones got away
All the good ones gone to waste

And I take another hit
And do I really get my joy stealing?
All the TV's hypnotised
All the loonies on the rise
And old man what I got to tell you

Tonight Ladies and Gentlemen
I roll the dice
Just gimmie that dice
It's been so hard working for no one
I roll the dice
Just gimmie the dice

Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah

Wakey wakey rise and shine
Put down your souvenirs I think it's time
We've been dead behind the eyes
Switching stations as our country dies

No matter what you do, you know
The world it keeps on turning
We never feel a thing
Come on and meet me at the Carnival

Tonight Ladies and Gentlemen
I roll the dice
Just gimmie that dice
It's been so hard working for no one
I roll the dice
Just gimmie that dice

Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah

No matter what you do, you know
The world it keeps on turning
We never feel a thing...
