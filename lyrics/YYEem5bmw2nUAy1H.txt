I see you hanging the crowd, staring me down with that ice cream cone.
Still I'm all alone... you've got me caught,
Let go my heart or give me a sign that you'll be mine.

I got a crush on you, got a crush on you, you won't let me through.
I got a crush on you, I got a crush on you, got a crush on you.
What am I to do? I got a crush on you.

I saw you flying the plane driving me insane,
Hit me with a bone 'til I'm all alone.
You driving that car, saw his arms,
Saw that black as tar must be your heart.

I got a crush on you, I got a crush on you, What am I to do?
I got a crush on you, I got a crush on you, got a crush on you.
Makin' me so blue, I got a crush on you.

Pandora's box has got a lock -- I'm gonna knock, gonna beat the clock.
I won't rest until Pandora's chest has been upset because I'm the one.

I got a crush on you, got a crush on you, you won't let me through.
I got a crush on you, I got a crush on you, got a crush on you.
Got a crush on you, I got a crush on you.

I can't relax; old Mister Scratch is on my back.
Made a devil's pact: trade an old black cat for a witches brew,
Seven, seven sins and you.

I got a crush on you, I got a crush on you, you won't let me through.
I got a crush on you, got a crush on you, makin' me so blue.
I got a crush on you. What am I to do? Got a crush on you.

Crush... you.
And you.
