Have you had a million reasons why you wish you'd never seen the truth?
Have you looked into the mirror and the problem's staring back at you?

I can't control myself
Don't know who I've been
And who is this monster wearing my skin?
A movie in black and white
When will it end?
'Cause every time I scream no one hears me

It feels like I'm paralyzed and I can't
Escape from the prison I'm living in
I'm naming the voices in my head
They keep on telling me to give in
But it's making me stronger
Fight a little longer
I'm gonna bring me back to life
And I won't be paralyzed

Have you searched for something deeper out of fear that life's a lonely road?
Have you roamed the darkest corners of the earth until you're just a ghost?

I can't control myself
Don't know who I've been
And who is this monster wearing my skin?
A movie in black and white
When will it end?
'Cause every time I scream no one hears me

It feels like I'm paralyzed and I can't
Escape from the prison I'm living in
I'm naming the voices in my head
They keep on telling me to give in
But it's making me stronger
Fight a little longer
I'm gonna bring me back to life
And I won't be paralyzed

I'm not afraid
I can face my demons even if they tear me down
If I fall, let me fall
It might take time but I'll find my own way out

It feels like I'm paralyzed and I can't
Escape from the prison I'm living in

It feels like I'm paralyzed and I can't
Escape from the prison I'm living in
I'm naming the voices in my head
They keep on telling me to give in
But it's making me stronger
Fight a little longer
I'm gonna bring me back to life
It feels like I'm paralyzed
Feels like I'm paralyzed
It feels like I'm paralyzed
Feels like I'm paralyzed
But it's making me stronger
Fight a little longer
I'm gonna bring me back to life
And I won't be paralyzed
