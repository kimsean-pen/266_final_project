Thinking out loud, singing 'bout us in that song
But I know that you probably think that I'm wrong
We got something, I feel it so deep in my bones
Still you wanna be alone, so

I'm standing at your front door
But I don't know what to say
You said I could have one more chance
To make up for mistakes
You wanted me to show up
But I feel like you don't want me to stay

So fucking tired of being just friends
I wanna fall in love again
I wanna fall in love again (I wanna fall in love again)
I wanna fall in love again
I wanna fall in love again
So fucking tired of being just friends
I wanna fall in love again

Feel like a fool alone at a table for two
So I head back to your neighborhood
Take a deep breath and then I step out of the car
To find the love right where we are, now

I'm standing at your front door
But I don't know what to say
You said I could have one more chance
To make up for mistakes
You wanted me to show up
But I feel like you don't want me to stay

So fucking tired of being just friends
I wanna fall in love again
I wanna fall in love again (I wanna fall in love again)
I wanna fall in love again
I wanna fall in love again
So fucking tired of being just friends
I wanna fall in love again

Blood is rushing to my head
Know I'm blushing, I don't care
I'll take the blame, mistakes I've made
But then why should you?
Now, make one too

I'm standing at your front door
Now I know just what to say
So fucking tired of being just friends

I wanna fall in love again
I wanna fall in love again (I wanna fall in love again)
Alright, I wanna fall in love again, yeah, yeah
I wanna fall in love again
So fucking tired of being just friends
I wanna fall in love again, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna fall in love again (I wanna fall in love again)
I wanna fall in love again
I wanna fall in love again
I wanna fall in love again
So fucking tired of being just friends
I wanna fall in love again
