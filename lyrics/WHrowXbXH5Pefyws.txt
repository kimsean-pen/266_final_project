To see the light...
To quench this thirst for air...
This awakened feeling forces me to climb the wall,
Of a self-made grave, a grave where I slept for so long
Like a blazing comet I won't stop till die

Far Far Away
Where no man has ever gone
Far Far Away
Heavy Metal Savior
Far Far Away
I will solve the mystery
And I'll rewrite history
Stories of my journey will be told
Far Far Away

I did not choose
To be the chosen one
Heretic's words remained misunderstood
Truth isn't out there, it's something you can't lose
I'm here and now but to them I'm Far Away

Far Far Away
Where no man has ever gone
Far Far Away
Heavy Metal Savior
Far Far Away
I will solve the mystery
And I'll rewrite history
Stories of my journey will be told
Far Far Away

(Solo)

Far Far Away
Where no man has ever gone
Far Far Away
Heavy Metal Savior
Far Far Away
I will solve the mystery
And I'll rewrite history
Stories of my journey will be told

Far Far Away
Where no man has ever gone
Far Far Away
Heavy Metal Savior
Far Far Away
I will solve the mystery
And I'll rewrite history
Stories of my journey will be told
Far Far Away
