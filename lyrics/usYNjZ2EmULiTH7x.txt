I won't break your...
I won't break your heart
I won't break your heart
In the dark

I'm new in the town
I see you at night
How to know this is the night
When I fight

In the tower
I see a cloud
How to know that it flows in the sky?

I won't break your heart
I won't break your heart
I won't break your heart
In the dark

I'm the shinai
'Cause I [?] flower
How to know that there's soul in the [?]

I know [?]
Sky and water
How to know that it flows only in the middle?

I won't break your heart (in the dark)
I won't break your heart

I won't break your heart
I won't break your heart
I won't break your heart
In the dark

I won't break your heart
I won't break your heart
I won't break your heart
