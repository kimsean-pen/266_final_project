You may go
somewhere between the fire
somewhere between the land
I will go

You may know
somewhere between the fire
somewhere between the land
I will go I will go

Maybe now it's time to be a man
Oh oh oh

If I had told you
that I'd never hurt you
Would you believe
Would you believe baby
Would you believe

If I had told you
that I'd never hurt you
Would you believe
Would you believe
Would you believe

You may know
to the ends from the start
I'm here to stay
don't you know
in my heart

And now that it's time I still
put you first
I wanna know baby

If I had told you
that I'd never hurt you
Would you believe
Would you believe baby
Would you believe

If I had told you
that I'd never hurt you
Would you believe
Would you believe baby
Do you believe
