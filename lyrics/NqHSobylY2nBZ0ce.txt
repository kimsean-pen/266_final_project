When I counted up my demons
Saw there was one for every day
With the good ones on my shoulders
I drove the other ones away

So, if you ever feel neglected
And if you think that all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons, yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

When you thought that it was over
You could feel it all around
Everybody's out to get you
Don't you let it drag you down

'Cause if you ever feel neglected
If you think that all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons, yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

If you ever feel neglected
If you think that all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons, yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

Singing it out, oh-oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah
And everything's not lost
So come on, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah
Come on, yeah
And everything's not lost

Oh-oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah
And everything's not lost
Come on, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah
Come on, yeah

Come on, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah
Come on, yeah
And everything's not lost
Sing out, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah
Come on, yeah
And everything's not lost

Come on, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah
Sing out, yeah
And everything's not lost

Now I never meant to do you wrong
But that's what I came here to say
But if I was wrong, then I'm sorry
I don't let it stand in our way

'Cause my head just hates when I think of
The things that I shouldn't have done
But life is for living, we all know
And I don't wanna live it alone

Sing out, ah-ah
Sing, ah-ah-ah
And just sing, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
