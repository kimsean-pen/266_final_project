Screams and nightmares of a life I want
Can't see living this lie no, a world I haunt
You've lost all control of my heart and soul
Satan holds my future, watch it unfold

I am the Antichrist
It's what I was meant to be
Your God left me behind
And set my soul to be free

Watching disciples of the satanic rule
Pentagram of blood holds the jackal's truth
Searching for the answer, Christ hasn't come
Awaiting the final moment, the birth of Satan's son

Screams, from a life I live
Torment is what I give
Torture is what I love
The downfall of the Heavens above

I am the Antichrist
All love is lost
Insanity is what I am
Eternally my soul will rot
Rot!
Rot!
