Could you believe, the same old story, it never bores me
Though I've heard it all before
Her name was Georgia and she was gorgeous
When she adored ya, the whole room would get to know

Like a movie that is filmed to the last
Coming at you with a double D bust
At the bed of a wounded soldier
In a rush 'cause she's gettin' older

Hanging out in the fancy bars
With the boys who can play guitar
Listen up 'cause I've got to warn ya
She's gonna make it out in California

Hey you, what's a good girl like you doin' in this crazy world?
Where's the good gone girl?
Dance, dance to the life you wanted when you were only 17
With your good girl dream

Oh, good gone girl

Could you believe the same old phonies, those painted ponies
That you've ridden all before
Her name was April but she was hateful
Enough to make you want to run right out the door

I can tell you what you want the most
Hang around for the champagne toast
When the end of the night gets tricky
Don't you know that beggars can't be picky?

Lookin' out for a man who's golden
Doesn't matter if he's old, he's rollin'
Coming at you like a desperate hunter
Sugar daddy but he's just a munter

Hey you, what's a good girl like you doin' in this crazy world?
Where's the good gone girl?
Dance, dance to the life you wanted when you were only 17
With your good girl dream

Hey you, what's a good girl like you doin' in this crazy world?
Where's the good gone girl?
Dance, dance to the life you wanted when you were only 17
With your good girl dream

Oh, good gone girl

She's walkin' around all over the town
Needs somebody to notice but the goodness gets her down
She's happy to choose somebody to use
Good gone girl, she's got nothin' left to lose

She's walkin' around all over the town
Needs somebody to notice but the goodness gets her down
She's happy to choose somebody to use
Good gone girl, she's got nothin' left to lose

She's walkin' around all over the town
Needs somebody to notice but the goodness gets her down
She's happy to choose somebody to use
Good gone girl, she's got nothin' left to lose
