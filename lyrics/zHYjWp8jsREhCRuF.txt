I am the boy your mother wanted you to meet
But I am broken and torn with heels at my feet (?)
And with your purest light why don't you shine on me
Well I should have been an angel
But I'm too dumb to speak
Now as she gets nearer, the visions get clearer
I'm kneeling, weeping
I will hold her dear
Oh, If your eyes water, you've got your favorite number to spin

And oh, what a crying shame, a crying shame
What we became

Murdered my throat, screaming bloody all night
Hit him with a book and how he crumbles
Oh you should have seen the arches tumble
Their golden no more
Now I'm smiling in my blood

I'm caught in a whirlwind
I'm going to heaven
I'm standing on trial and it's painted on canvas
An eternal testament to how we are so animalistic

And oh, what a crying shame, what a crying shame
What we became

I bow my head in the morning light and say goodnight
I held her hand and I, I kissed her eyes
Stumbled down the stairs and hang my self on high
And I started for the town that i have a front yard
And died
