I've been praying for something
Warm sheets and a bad diagnosis
And I'm still sitting here, stoned and at home
I've been desperate to find it
Warm eyes and two hands to revive this
Because I'm still sitting here, bored and alone
Stoned and at home

I wanted love
I wanted something to call my own
I wanted love
I wanted something to bring back home

You'd say I'm a sapphire in pieces
And slowly, I'd start to believe it
'Cause I'm still sitting here, stoned and at home
Sometimes the struggle's enticing
The world stares in judgment inside me
And I'm still sitting here, bored and alone

I wanted love
I wanted something to call my own
I wanted love
I wanted something to bring back home
I wanted trust
I wanted something to call my own
You let me down
I guess that's something to bring back home
