I could say it right now
But it's not the time
I see those friendly faces but they only make me anxious
I could shout it out loud
In the crowded space
People have been hoping but never been that open

There's not much left to do
Even less to say
But glued together moments
Just to throw them all away
Am I looking for a change?
A way to mend?
Something tells me different
But I know it never ends

I've been here before
Don't you know it's all the same
I've been here before
Don't you know you're not to blame
For feeling
(Anxious, anxious)

This head won't quiet down
For a single thought
I'm all circle psychopathic
Barely up I just forgot that
I could say it right now
I could make the time
People have being hoping and I'm finally breaking open

Tried screaming but I won't believe it
I'll tell them what they want to hear then
Just give me a week or two to find it
Then maybe we'll get back to the place we started

I've been here before
Don't you know it's all the same
Don't you know you're not to blame
I'm thinking that
I've been here before
Don't you know it's all the same
Don't you know you're not to blame
For feeling

Tried screaming but I won't believe it
(I've been here before)
I'll tell them what they want to hear then
(Don't you know it's all the same)
Just give me a week or two to find it
(Don't you know you're not to blame)
Then maybe we'll get back to the place we started
(For feeling)
