You're the fun and the wrong and the good and the right
So glad I waited to have you in my life
'Cause I could've been looking for love in a relationship
Talking to my girlfriends about him, saying although if
He knew what he had he would be more careful
I don't have to worry about you

Baby, if I had to choose you I would do it again
If I had to choose you you'd still be my man
'Cause you don't ever have excuses
You don't hesitate to prove it
If I had to choose you, you (You)
You'd still be right here

Tunnel vision every day, I'm in your sight, ooh, yeah
'Cause you give me certainty instead of just a smile
'Cause you wear the title of a man like a jersey
And forever with me baby you're MVP
I promise I'll love you with honors, woo-hoo
I don't have to worry about you

Baby, if I had to choose you I would do it again
If I had to choose you you'd still be my man
'Cause you don't ever have excuses
You don't hesitate to prove it
If I had to choose you, you (You)
You'd still be right here

I'ma still, I'ma still
Be right here baby
Oh baby, I'ma still
Be right here

Baby, if I had to choose you I would do it again
If I had to choose you you'd still be my man
'Cause you don't ever have excuses
You don't hesitate to prove it
If I had to choose you, you (You)
Babe, you'd still be right here
