I know my eyes already like you
baby you, i know that love, love is found
love is found.

I cut the radio on, i know there won't be long
i can hear you baby, i can feel your sound
i put thing closer now, now like i feel the sound

I know my eyes already like you
baby you, i know that love, love is found
love is found

Oh, my heart go ba-boom-boom-boom, ba-boom-boom-boom
my heart go ba-boom-boom-boom ba-boom-boom-boom

I know my eyes already like you
baby you, i know that love, love is found
love is found.

Oh, my heart go ba-boom-boom-boom, ba-boom-boom-boom
my heart go ba-boom-boom-boom ba-boom-boom-boom

I know my eyes already like you
baby you, i know that love, love is found
love is found.
