Eight o'clock in the morning
And I'm movin' on out to school
With an open book and a sleepy look
The teacher can't be fooled
I took a pass in the early class
The teacher will never know
That I postponed my work at home
Watching the evening show

Hey there Anthony boy
Why are you in such a rush (go!)
The girl, she wanna talk to you
Look at him, he's a-blush (go!)
Three o'clock in the afternoon
Completes the day of school
Before the ding can feast a ring
He's in the vestibule

Betty and Barbara and Jeannie and Jane
Are yakety-yakkin' with Joan
About some things that Anthony told her
Over the telephone
Here there, Tony me boy
Why are you in such a rush (go!)
The girl, she wanna talk to you
Look at him, he's a-blush (go!)

Hey there Anthony boy
Why are you in such a rush (go!)
The girl, she wanna talk to you
Look at him, how he blush (go!)
Betty told Lee the second that I
Had told her not to tell
Now that you know, she knows I know
You know that all is well

Calm down, Tony me boy
Don't let them get in your hair
With a good education
You may become a multi miljonaire
Hey there Anthony boy
Why are you in such a rush (go!)
The girl, she wanna talk to you
Look at him, he's a-blush (go!)
