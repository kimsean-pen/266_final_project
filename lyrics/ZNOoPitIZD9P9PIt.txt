Television in disgrace
Life you get old, it's the race
Can you break out?
Can you break out?
Will you live at your own pace?

Life, so, unnecessary

Television in disgrace
Life you get old, it's the race
Can you break out?
Can you break out?
Will you live at your own pace?

Now will you live at your own pace?
Will you live at your own pace?
