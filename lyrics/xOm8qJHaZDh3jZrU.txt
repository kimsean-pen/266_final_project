You know that I love you baby
Yeah, there ain't nobody else
But I get tired of hating myself
This kind of pain, it ain't easy
To move on and be strong
I've been digging deep
And losing sleep
You know that I'm trying
(So hard, so hard, so hard)
Oh I'm trying
(So hard, so damn hard)
Oh, you know that I'm trying
(So hard, so hard, so hard)
Yeah, I'm trying
(So hard, so damn hard)
Say I've been acting real different
From when we first got together
And I don't know why I can't get it together
But up in my head, there's been stormy weather
And the sun is rising slow
So much that I've been realising lately
The world, it, can be cold, it can be shady
But I wanna see the light
And yeah it's worth the fight
Now I don't wanna waste another minute inside
Yeah, you know that I'm trying!
(So hard, so hard, so hard)
Oh I'm trying
(So hard, so damn hard)
Oh, you know that I'm trying!
(So hard, so hard, so hard)
Yeah, I'm trying
(So hard, so damn hard)
(I've been trying, I've been trying)
See babe, I know it must be kinda hard
Loving someone like me with all these skeletons and scars
But I'm worth it
(I've been trying, I've been trying)
Man, I can be a crazy bitch sometimes but no one's fucking perfect
Are you?
Didn't think so
I've been trying, I've been trying
I've been trying, I've been trying
I've been trying, I've been trying
