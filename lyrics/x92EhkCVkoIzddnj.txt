Born from the light, journey into the moment
Delivered from thought and sky
He will be one, one with the land
Lord of wind and the sea and the sands
The one, the bringer of life

All will bear a part of me
Let this hollow shell set your free to live as one

Here we are, children of sun and stars
The first to know and to understand
Living by the law of the ages
Prophets and sages, forging utopia

Great Ptah Khnemu, sacred priest of the temple of Ra
And the keeper of truth
Crystalline spheres, the power of light
Grant us keys to the stars and the secrets of flight
Five shall be as one

We unlock the mysteries of knowledge and technology

Here we are, children of sun and stars
The first to know and to understand
Living by the law of the ages
Prophets and sages, forging utopia

We shall live forever, and cast out those less divine
Gods we will be rulers of the sea, in our grand design

Here we are, children of sun and stars
The first to know and to understand
Living by the law of the ages
Prophets and sages, forging utopia

Here we are, children of sun and stars
The first to know and to understand
(The first to understand)
Living by the law of the ages
Prophets and sages, forging utopia
