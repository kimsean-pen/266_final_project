Yeah!
Come on!

Do you remember what we used to have
As if all our dreams were possible
All that existed was you and I
But distance has torn us apart

Forgive me for all that I've done wrong
Lead me back to where my heart belongs

Can we start again?
Go back in time to where we started
Can we start again?
What we have can't be discarded

Do you remember the promises we made?
But somehow we have lost our way
Take me back to where my heart belongs
Forever made for every day

I know that you doubt my words
I swear there will never be regret

Can we start again?
We thought love was everlasting
Can we start again?
What we had just can't be wasted

Silent thoughts were broken
And words that can't be taken back
But you mean so much more to me
Than anything, anything I've ever known

And this is the hope for tomorrow
That today you will return
Can we start again?
Go back in time to where we started
Can we start again?
What we have can't be discarded
Can we start again? (Do you remember?)
Can we start again?
Can we start again?
Go back in time to where we started
