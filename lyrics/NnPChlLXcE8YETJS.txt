I love you (woo-woo-woo-woo)
'Cos you tell me things I want to know
And it's true (woo-woo-woo-woo)
That it really only goes to show
That I know that I, I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue

Now you're mi-i-i-i-ine
My happiness, dear, makes me cry
And in ti-i-i-i-ime
You'll understand the reason why
If I cry, it's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had

I can't believe
It's happened to me
I can't conceive
Of any more
Misery

Ask me why
I'll say I love you (ooooh)
And I'm always thinking of you
I love you (woo-woo-woo-woo)

'Cos you tell me things I want to know

Ask me why
I'll say I love you (ooooh)
And I'm always thinking of you

I can't believe
It's happened to me-e-e-e
I can't conceive
Of any more
Misery

Ask me why
I'll say I love you (ooooh)
And I'm always thinking of you
You (ooh)
You (ooh)
