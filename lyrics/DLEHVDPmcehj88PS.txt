Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Nigga 'bout to run up in your house and get rough

Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Nigga 'bout to run up in your house and get rough

Every morning I wake up in a bad mood
Attitude fucked up, he's a bad dude
No emotion, numb, wanna lace 'em up
Step out the door like a warrior facing up (what)
Embrace fate, can't wait till I see your brains
You can't look into my eyes shot me to sleep
I'm made of stone, you got a heart of glass, keep your distance
I set the tone on the crested moon, soon, bitches
Growing up in the cut, soaking gangs vital
So insane, pick your brain - cannibal style
The nightmares that I'm living wouldn't wish on you
Pieces rare like the steak that he piss on you
Putting up racks bitch, I hope you fall off
Squeeze, click, bang - body gets hold off
Send the dogs on you 'fore you get slaughter
I'm laughing at you, when I hit my J i'm all off

Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Nigga 'bout to run up in your house and get rough

Stay the course
Staying hungry but your fear is what I fed on
What I'm holdin'? Dumb if you pop your chest
Lights out, see the exco family crest
Broken dreams what I see when my eyes open
Like it's Monday and I'm just going through the motions
See the dream, I want the nightmares come to life
Fighting my demons, heard a voice, coming to the light
Soul burning like coal in a steam engine
Silence my enemies swift with a clean endin'
The way Terry looking for somethin' upliftin'
Intoxicated by the blind lust, fuck sleepin'
I was raised like a Nomad, stay driftin'
Two wheels, sideways bitch, heart skippin'
I'm fire with the ice, hit you twice, no quarter
Eliminate these motherfuckers in no order (yeah)

Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
Put 'em in the ground, put 'em, put 'em in the ground
