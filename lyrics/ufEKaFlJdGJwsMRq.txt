It can't stop now
The signs keep changing on me
Like a shimmering bell
Long waves enveloping me
And my plastic mind
So chewed and shrinking all the time
Feels it whirling by
Morning, afternoon, then night
And I can't get down

If I don't feel right
Polishing off the sand
Lay by me, and we'll erode
As gently as we can
Into twilight

Into twilight
Into twilight
Into twilight
