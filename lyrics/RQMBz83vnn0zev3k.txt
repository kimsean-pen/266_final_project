Come forth! Come hither!
All that may die! All that may bleed!
All that is able to writhe in the punishment of a God.
Woman and child, man and swine.
Warriors and slaves alike.
For alike shall you add to the cup.
And equally shall I spew thee out like worms.
Into the kingdom of the living god!

Now hear me, son of man;
I too have shed tears for thy suffering.
Yet tears of pity, they were not!
They were tears of joy!
I too have drunk the blood of Christ.
So sweet upon my lips...
Gushing from the open wounds of man,
Of beast, of woman, of God,
Of all that lives and may bleed.

"Why dost thou loiter?"
Many that have debts to pay.
Shiver, you thy back in line.
Like rats in a maze.
Rats who may suffer.
Yes! Rats who may bleed.
Into hells hungry mouth.
Red and full of spice.
Like the rain to cleanse your paradise.
The salt of Satan in the wounds of Christ.

Come! Let me wash thee.
From the stench of skin let me rid thee.
Yes my hand is pale,
But the heart, my love, is dark as night!
Saints and sinners, white as black,
In guilt revel ye all alike
And all alike shall ye bleed - All who may!
All that may die on that glorious day!

Now harken! This song of wounds.
It's sung for the sake of your suffering
Yet one of pity it is not, I sing of joy!
I too have tasted the piss of God
But I spat it back straight into the cunting wounds
Of man, of beast, of woman, of God,
of all that lives and may bleed
