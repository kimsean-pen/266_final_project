New love is blind
Why don't you see?
You hurt me inside
You're killing me
It makes me sad all the time
To see you around
With all these guys

My heart's in pain
I need you so
My love's the same
So please don't go

You give me all I need
You give me all I need
You give me all I need
You give me all I need

Let's try again
There's still romance
We'll start a new life
Take a chance
There are so many ways
Please don't forget it
Anyday

My heart's in pain
I need you so
My love's the same
So please don't go

You give me all I need
You give me all I need
You give me all I need
You give me all I need

You give me all I need
You give me all I need
You give me all I need
You give me all I need

You give me all I need
You give me all I need
You give me all I need
You give me all I need

You give me all I need
You give me all I need
You give me all I need
