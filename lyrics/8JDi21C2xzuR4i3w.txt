Say my name, if you think it's over
You aren't everything at once
Think that you're, you're indecisive
I wish I had had enough

I've tried hard to keep the distance
Not to get too much involved
Think that you're, you are indecisive
I know that I've had had enough

You waited staring at your telephone
You think that I'm the one to call home
You wasted more than you could ever know
You wish that I am the one to come home
You waited staring at your telephone
You think that I'm the one to call home
You wasted more than you could ever know
You wish that I am the one to come home

Say my name, if you think it's over
I've lost track of what you think
I don't mind, I think it's quiet amusing
We both know you're not that type

You waited staring at your telephone
You think that I'm the one to call home
You wasted more than you could ever know
You wish that I am the one to come home

You waited staring at your telephone
You think that I'm the one to call home
You wasted more than you could ever know
You wish that I am the one to come home

Say my name, if you think it's over
Say my name, if you think it's over
