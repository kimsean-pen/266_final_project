I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun
For another overload

I hear you singing in the wire
And I hear you in the whine
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line

I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
If it snows that stretch down south
Will never stand the strain

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line

(Instrumental)

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line

Still on the line
Still on the line...
