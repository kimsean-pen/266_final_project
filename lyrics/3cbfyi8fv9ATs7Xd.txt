All the ones that don't make sense
All the ones that are in my head
It's like I'm drowning in your waters again
Why abandon the ship with so much left to save?

What's your favorite way to dull the pain?
I haven't found a way to replace you
What's your favorite way to dull the pain?
I haven't found a way to replace you, but I wish I could

Call me up to cut me open again
Beautiful and cold
You stay within your frame
It's hypothetical any way that you look at it
It doesn't feel like anything

What's your favorite way to dull the pain?
I haven't found a way to replace you
What's your favorite way to dull the pain?
I haven't found a way to replace you, but I wish I could
But I wish I could
