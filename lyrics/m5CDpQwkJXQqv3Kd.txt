Hello, I know theres someone out there
Who can understand
And who's feeling the same way as me
I'm twenty-four and I've got everything to live for
But I know now that it wasn't meant to be
'cause all has been lost and all has been won
And there's nothing left for us to save
But now I know that I don't want to be alone today
So if you find that you've been feeling just the same

Call me now it's alright
It's just the end of the world
You need a friend in the world
'cause you can't hide
So call and I'll get right back
If your intentions are pure
I'm seeking a friend for the end of the world

I've got a photograph, I'll send it off today
And you will see that I am perfectly sane
Not for a lifetime or forever and a day
'cause we know now that just wont be the case

Call me now it's alright
It's just the end of the world
You need a friend in the world
'cause you can't hide
So call and I'll get right back
If your intentions are pure
I'm seeking a friend for the end of the world

There will be no commitment and no confessions
And no little secrets to keep
No little children or houses with roses
Just the end of the world and me
'cause all has been gone and all has been done
And there's nothing left for us to say
But we could be together as they blow it all away
And we can share in every moment as it breaks

So call me now it's alright
It's just the end of the world
You need a friend in the world
'cause you cant hide
So call and I'll get right back
If your intentions are pure
I'm seeking a friend for the end of the world
So call me now it's alright
It's just the end of the world
You need a friend in the world
'cause you cant hide
So call and I'll get right back
If your intentions are pure
I'm seeking a friend for the end of the world
