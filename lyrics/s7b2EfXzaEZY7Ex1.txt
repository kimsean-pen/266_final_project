Blind your eyes
The journey is beginning
Hold on tight
We're heading to past times
Feel how your brain is distorting
All you see
I have been shouting your name
But you just can't hear
Listen to me!

I'm your guide
Approaching from the future
Be prepared
To fly above the rainbow
Know that your mind is distorting
All you feel
Jumping from places in time
You have never been
Now come along with me!

Riding faster than the speed of light
Flash throught the skies
Towards forever
We'll bring a message that can save mankind
Open your minds
Cause we are the travelers of time

I have been sailing in a dream
You can take me through this door
Eternally!
There's so many places we can go
Let's get moving on!

We're riding faster than the speed of light
Flash through the skies
The age of forever
We'll bring a message that can save mankind
Open your minds
We are the travelers of time

Flash through the skies
Riding the rainbow's eye
Open your minds
Cause we are the travelers of time
