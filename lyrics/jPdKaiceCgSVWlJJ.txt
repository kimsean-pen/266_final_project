Did you really think that
I would really take you back
Let you back in my heart
One more time? Oh, no no

Did you think I'd still care
That there'd be more feeling there?
Did you think you could walk back
In my life? Oh

So you found you missed the love you threw away
Baby, but you found it out too late, too late

And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
And baby I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best, I learned from you
Oh baby, now, I learned from you

I remember cold nights
Tears I thought would never dry
How you shattered my world
With your goodbye, your goodbye, baby

Would've sold my soul then
Just to have you back again
Now you are the last thing
On my mind

Now you say you're sorry and you've changed your ways
Sorry but you changed your ways too late

And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
And baby I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best, I learned from you
Oh baby, now, I learned from you

So when all you've got are sleepless night
When those tears are clouding up your eyes
Just remember it was you
Who said goodbye, who said goodbye
And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
And baby I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best, I learned from you
Learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best, I learned from you
I learned from the best, I learned from you
