Life is tough if you find you got it all and you're not satisfied

people try to lead you astray

but I ain't gonna fall for the games that they play

I know of the damger
I'm foolin' with strangers.

You
you are my one temptation

you
you are the one I've no resistance to.
Yeah
honey
it's you
you are my one temptation

you give me the thrill that I'm addicted to.
You're my one temptation.

You can look
you can touch
nothing is free if you pay too much

when there's talk on the street

and the pressure is hot to want more than you got.
I don't hear what they're saying
day out and day in.

You
you are my one temptation

you
you are the one I've no resistance to.
Nobody knows you are my one temptation

you give me a thrill that I'm addicted to.
You're my one temptation.

Nothing ever happens till you show your face around

can't let you see that you turn my world around.
My love lines grow and get too strong to say no.

You
you are my one temptation

you
you are the one I've no resistance to.
Yeah
honey
it's you
you are my one temptation

you give me the thrill that I'm addicted to.
You're my one temptation.
