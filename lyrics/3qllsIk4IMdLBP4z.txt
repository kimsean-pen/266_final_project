I'll find a way to your house
It's dark and it's raining, it's nice out
I'll bite my tongue when your friend's around
We'll meet at a mall in a new town
I can't believe that it's dark out
It's 6:45 and my headlights
Are telling me I have to go now
My car likes to slide when it's wet and
My hands are still cramping
Less than they were when around you
I tense all my muscles in your view
Spend all my time trying soda
To tell myself I'm just as new to you
Anxiety likes to control us
I comfort the fact that you're still you
I am afraid that I know you
I'm just afraid that I know you
I'm just afraid that I know you so well

You'll find a place with a backyard
A place that you can still run to
Drinking a lot in the morning
Knowing that it's gonna kill you
I'll find a way to go home now
Under a bridge self-loathing
You can't survive without caffeine
Your friends aren't enough to be happy, I swear

Your friends aren't enough to be happy, I swear
