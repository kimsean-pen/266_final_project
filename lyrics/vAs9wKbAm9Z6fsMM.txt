My reflection wraps and pulls me under
Healing waters to be bathed in Bre単a
Guide me safely in worlds I've never been
To heal me, heal me, my dear Bre単a

Vulnerable
It's all right

Heal me, heal me, my dear Bre単a
Show me lonely and show me openings
To bring me closer to you, my dear Bre単a

Vulnerable
It's all right

Opening to heal...
Opening to heal...
Heal...
