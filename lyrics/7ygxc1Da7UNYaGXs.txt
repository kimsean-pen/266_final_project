Everything comes back to this
Every embrace, every perfect kiss
You try to scare me with those clenched fists
But I told you darling, I cant handle this

At least now you know
See I was telling the truth
And this world I walk trough walks trough me too, uhh

Well I only like his hat
Not him
His hat
Not him
Not him
Not him
him...

Everyday I pretend I don't see you
But in the end I'll admit in fact you are
All I see but must ignore
Someday soon I'll be how I used to
In this world I walk trough walks trough me too

Well I only like his hat
Not him
Well I only like his hat
Not him
Not him

You ask me why is that
I say nothing with a full scream
Full scream
Full scream

Three the ___(?)
To scave (?)

To love again
To love again
To love again
To love again
To love again
To love again
hmmm
But I love again
