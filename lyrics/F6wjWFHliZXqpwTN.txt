Fire is burning
Casting a shadow
People are watching
Waiting for the fall

Whispers are creeping
Under the gallows
People are talking
We could lose it all

Tell them something is coming
There's blood in the water
Give them a warning
Let it all come crashing down
Burn the castle to the ground
Hang the lies, no disguise
It's our time
Let it all come
Down down, down

Pointing our arrows
Fighting for glory
Heat in the narrow
We could lose it all

Let it all come crashing down
Burn the castle to the ground
Hang the lies, no disguise
It's our time
Let it all come down

Burn the castle to the ground
All the cries, alibis
It's our time
Let it all come down down
Down down
Down, down

Let it all come crashing down
Burn the castle to the ground
Hang the lies, no disguise
It's our time
Let it all come down
Burn the castle to the ground
All the cries, alibis
It's our time
Let it all come down
Down, down
