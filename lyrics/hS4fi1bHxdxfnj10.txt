Give me reason to stay here
Cause I don't want to live in fear
(Don't live in fear)
I can't stop the rain
But I can stop the tears
Oh, I can't fight the fire

But I can fight the fear
No more
I just can't live in fear
No more
I can't take it
Can't take it
No more

What do we stand for
When we all live in fear?
Give me reason to believe
Cause you don't wanna see me leave
I can't stop the rain
But I can stop the tears

Oh, I can't fight the fire
But I can fight the fear
No more
I just can't live in fear
No more
I can't take it
Can't take it

No more
What do we stand for
When we all live in fear?
No more
I just can't live in fear
No more
I can't take it
Can't take it
No more
What do we stand for
When we all live in fear?
