I know I'm not that tall
I know I'm not that smart
But let me drive my van into your heart
Let me drive my van into your heart
I know I'm not that rich
I'm trying to get my start
So let me drive my van into your heart
Let me drive my van into your heart
And if we look out of place
Well, baby, that's okay
I'll drive us into outer space
Where we can't hear what people say
I know I don't have a plan
I'm working on that part
At least I've got a van
So let me drive my van into your heart
Let me drive my van into your heart
Let me drive my van into your heart
Let me drive my van into your heart
Let me drive my van into your heart
