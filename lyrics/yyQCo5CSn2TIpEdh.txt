So cash in all your chips tonight, baby
Cause were going out of style
We could leave this city, if only for a while

Well take this feeling to our graves
For every heart that we betrayed
No one can know about this

Well take this feeling to our graves

For every heart that we betrayed

No one can know about this
The only place I'll ever call home, is my deathbed
I know we're so wrong
But it feels so right
And it's not a party
If it happens every night
I'm running on empty
Your running out of luck
So lets ditch this city
Before we sober up
