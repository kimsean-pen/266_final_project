Tell me what it is, it isn't fair but
I'm wasting time, 'cause it isn't my heart
It's my fault
And every situation understands, well
The anecdote of chasing the locations to your doors
Yeah yeah, da da

'Cause I'm wasting time, now wasting money again
And all the cigarettes that I have never smoked
And all the letters that I have never sent, da da
Da da da da

Now he was sitting by the swimming pool
But he was scared, 'cause it wasn't his time, it wasn't his chance
And getting older's not been on my plans
But it's never late, it's never late enough for me to stay, yeah yeah, da da

'Cause I'm wasting time, now wasting money again
And all the cigarettes that I have never smoked
And all the letters that I have never sent, no no da da
Da da da da
