(Now the deed is gone)Ela disse adeus
(As you blink she is gone)
(Let her get on with life)
(Let her have some fun)
(Now the deed is done) Ela disse adeus
(As you blink she is gone)
(Let her get on with life)
(Let her have some fun)

Ela disse adeus e chorou
Já sem nenhum sinal de amor
Ela se vestiu e se olhou
Sem luxo mas se perfumou
Lágrimas por ninguém
Só porque é triste o fim
amor se acabou

Ele quis lhe pedir pra ficar
De nada ia adiantar
Quis lhe prometer melhorar
E quem iria acreditar
Ela não precisa mais de você
Sempre o último a saber

(Now the deed is gone)Ela disse adeus
(As you blink she is gone)
(Let her get on with life)
(Let her have some fun)
(Now the deed is done) Ela disse adeus
(As you blink she is gone)
(Let her get on with life)
(Let her have some fun)

Disse adeus e chorou
Já sem nenhum sinal de amor
Ela se vestiu e se olhou
Sem luxo mas se perfumou
Lágrimas por ninguém

Quis lhe prometer melhorar
E quem iria acreditar
Ela não precisa mais de você
