There was a time where I was tried for love
And somehow I start to glow
A feeling that I had let go
There was a time where I was tried for love
And once I turned away I had a long for you to stay

And if I asked to stay
One more night
One more day

There was a time where I was tried for love
And then you walked on in and hurt to see you again

And if I asked you to stay
One more night
One more day

If I had to turn that plane around
'Cause I need your love around
You'd say

Love strike
Oh you're saying
Love strike
Oh I need it
Love strike

Love strike
Oh you're saying
Love strike
Oh I need it
Love strike

Love strike
Oh you're saying
Love strike
Oh I need it
Love strike

Love strike
Oh you're saying
Love strike
Oh I need it
Love strike
