now I can set you free
be what you wanna be
don't wanna live alone
I gotta be so strong
don't wanna be alone
Baby I love you so

and never let you go
I'm looking for your face
wating for warm embrace
I'm living in the space
I'm following your trace

tell me what's going on
tell me what's going on
I'm gonna make you queen
girl have you ever seen

Ooh baby come to me
baby just come to me
don't breake my heart tonight
swinging my soul desire
baby just come to me
be what you wanna be
using your fantasy

I need your soul to see ("Baby just come to me
now we can do it right...")

I never thing you wanna
we won't belong

I can see your face too strong
I sing you wanna think
you'll be wide on mind
don't you ever satisfy
my soul in any by my side

I'm not laughing, I'm not crying
Don't you go
Baby I love you so
and never let you go
I'm looking for your face
wating for warm embrace

I'm living in the space
I'm following your trace
tell me what's going on
tell me what's going on
I'm gonna make you queen

girl have you ever seen

Ooh baby come to me
baby just come to me
don't breake my heart tonight
swinging my soul desire
baby just come to me...

I never thing you wanna
we won't belong
I can see your face too strong
I sing you wanna think
you'll be wide on mind
don't you ever satisfy my soul
in any by my side
I'm not laughing, I'm not crying
Don't you go
Baby I love you so, and never let you go
I'm looking for your face
waiting for warm embrace
I'm living in the space
I'm following your trace
tell me what's going on
tell me what's going on
I'm gonna make you queen
girl have you ever seen
Ooh baby come to me...
...To me

I never thing you wanna
we won't belong
I can see your face too strong
I sing you wanna think
you'll be wide on mind
don't you ever satisfy my soul
in any by my side
I'm not laughing, I'm not crying
Don't you go
Baby I love you so, and never let you go
I'm looking for your face
waiting for warm embrace
I'm living in the space
I'm following your trace
tell me what's going on
tell me what's going on
I'm gonna make you queen
girl have you ever seen
Ooh baby come to me
