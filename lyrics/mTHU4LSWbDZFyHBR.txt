I don't want to lose, this good thing
That I got 'cause if I do
I will surely,
Surely lose a lot.
'Cause your love is better
Than any love I know.
It's like thunder, lightning,
The way you love me is frightening.
I'd better knock, on wood, baby.

Well I'm not superstitious about you
But I can't take no chance.
You got me spinnin', baby,
Baby I'm in a trance.
'Cause your love is better
Than any love I know.
It's like thunder, lightning,
The way you love me is frightening.
I'd better knock, on wood, baby.

Break

Ain't no secret, that young men
He fills my lovin' cup
He see's to it, that I get enough
Just one touch from him
You know it means so much

It's like thunder, lightning,
The way you love me is frightening.

I'd better knock (knock knock) on wood baby.

(knock knock)
Oh Yeah!

I think I'd better knock (knock knock) on wood
I think I'd better knock (knock knock) on wood
I think I'd better knock (knock knock) on wood
