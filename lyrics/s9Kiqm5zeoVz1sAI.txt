Lying awake at night, (Always the same)
Clouds start to break, washing away our goodbyes
Those were the days
wash it away

Oh these days
Always dreaming
sinking deeper

Oh these days
Always slipping
drifting deeper

Watching our days, watching our days go by
Boiling with hatred
I can't find the answers to all the lies you once clung to

Oh these days
Always dreaming
sinking deeper

Oh these days
Always slipping
drifting deeper

Always sinking drifting deeper
Always dreaming sinking deeper

I'll patiently wait
'til time ticks away
Spilling with questions
those were the days
never to change
Always the same
Our love is timeless
Oh these days
Always dreaming
sinking deeper
Oh these days
Always slipping
drifting deeper
