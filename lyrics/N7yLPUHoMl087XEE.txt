Who told you to hide behind the veil?
Who told you to get out of the way?
Don't you let them steal your dreams
Feel the courage, spread your wings and breathe

Keep the faith, keep the faith
Remember you are not alone
Hold my hand and come along

You keep the faith, keep the faith
Don't let nobody turn you down
Even if the world is rough

Who told you that I reached the point with no regrets?
Who told you that my life is a book of fairytales?
I have lost many times
But I've never lost my hope

Keep the faith, keep the faith
Remember you are not alone
Hold my hand and come along

You keep the faith, keep the faith
Don't let nobody turn you down
Even if the world is rough

Oh (Oh), oh (oh)
Oh, you got to stand on your own
Crowd, hear me out
The world needs more love

(Keep the faith, keep the faith) Oh yeah...
Remember you are not alone
Hold my hand and come along

You keep the faith, keep the faith
Don't let nobody turn you down
Even if the world is rough

Oh... keep the faith
