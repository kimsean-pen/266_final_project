Wheels be spinning faster from home
Come brush closer to where you wanna go
Lick my wounds, sing it to overcome
A handful miles only to be gone

*Interlude*

We be blazing
Blaze, blazing
Blaze, blazing
Blazing
We be blazing
Blaze, blazing
Blaze, blazing
Blazing

*Interlude*

Blazing
Blaze, blazing
Blaze, blazing
Blazing
Blaze, blazing
Blaze, blazing
Blaze, blazing
Blazing
Blazing

Headlights cut the black with a glow
Heavy breathing streams down the window
Stays on my skin in the heat of the dark
All I need is to feel your spark

We be blazing
Blaze, blazing
Blaze, blazing
Blazing
We be blazing
Blaze, blazing
Blaze, blazing
Blazing

Blazing
Blaze, blazing
Blaze, blazing
Blazing
Blaze, blazing
Blaze, blazing
Blaze, blazing
Blaze, blazing

I came what I came what I came here for
And I lean my head on your insides and we
We be blazing
Your reflection speeding quickly by
The night is now, your eyes will spark and we
We be blazing

I came what I came what I came here for
And I lean my head on your insides and we
Your reflection speeding quickly by
The night is now, your eyes will spark and we

I came what I came what I came here for
And I lean my head on your insides and we
We be blazing
Your reflection speeding quickly by
The night is now, your eyes will spark and we
We be blazing

I came what I came what I came here for
And I lean my head on your insides and we
We be blazing
Your reflection speeding quickly by
