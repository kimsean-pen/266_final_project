I am looking for someone to love
Once you catch me, don't let me fall
I need a vision give me a sign
I need attention, give me your time
I need a prophet, i need a god
I need a reason, i need you now
I'd like to stay, I need to go
I am chasing shadows, no where to go
I need to fly high
Above the sky
Need you now now
You go need me later
****He needs a fine one***
Of course she wants for better or for worse
Just this morning
I woke up and realized, we all need something
Why do you hate me?
Why don't you care?
Do you remember we used to share
Why do you fear?
Why don't you dare?
I still remember you had this flare
I miss my sisters, i hope they're fine
You miss your papa, that's why you cry
I need to meet them, you need to hold him
Like I need a new call
We all need Jesus
I need to fly high
Above the sky
Need you now now
You go need me later
****He needs a fine one***
Of course she wants for better or for worse
Just this morning
I woke up and realized, we all need love

People need to know
The people need each other
Together we will grow
Tell everyone to gather
The people need to know
We reflect each other
if the people stand as one
The people will be stronger.
