(Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na)
Just like a blanket
Left behind
Like inspiration
Running out of time

When you left me out there alone
I was waiting for you to come back and take me home
Just like lost and found
I was hoping you'd come back for me
Just like lost and found
If you never came back I'd need someone who deserved me

Turn my world upside down
The day that you left me around
For lost and found
For lost and found

Just like a penny
Dropped on the ground
That everyone's kicking
Not caring about
That's how you make me feel

When you left me out there alone
I was waiting for you to come back and take me home
Just like lost and found
I was hoping you'd come back for me
Just like lost and found
If you never came back I'd need someone who deserved me

Turn my world upside down
The day that you left me around
For lost and found (oooohh woah)
For lost and found (oooohh woah yeah)

I waited for you to come back for me
But you took long and now someone else got me (yeah)
Just like lost and found
I was hoping you'd come back for me
Just like lost and found
If you never came back I'd need someone who deserved me
Turn my world upside down
The day that you left me around
For lost and found (ooooh woah)
For lost and found (ooooh woah)
