Everyone thinks I am shallow
When I'm hiding in my room
Safe within my zone
All the demons that I summon
Wipe the blood off from the floor
It's not only lore
Sorry!
Whoo!
N, G
R, I
Mundane
Bloodstain
NGRI, in my brain
Keep a clean
Bloodstain
I've awoken from my slumber
I was dreamin' 'bout a blood
Covered in my blood
Now my pits are getting sweaty
It's a sign I've got to go
Back to where I know
Sorry!
Whoo!
Suffer endlessly
Suffer endlessly, forever
Mmmmmm, whoo!
N, G
R, I
Mundane
Bloodstain
NGRI, it's plain
Wipe it up
Bloodstain
N, G
R, I
Mundane
Bloodstain
NGRI, in my brain
Sweep a clean
Bloodstain
