I could hardly believe it
When I heard the news today
I had to come and get it straight from you

They said you were leaving
Someone swept your heart away
From the look upon your face I see its true

Tell me all about it
Tell about the plans you're making
Then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell my how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
and how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been living for is gone

Didn't come here for crying
didn't come here to break down
It's just the dream of mine is coming to an end

How can I blame you
when I built my world around
the hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends

I don't want to know the price I'm going to pay for dreaming
I need you now
it's more than I can take

Tell my how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
and how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been living for is gone

I don't want to know the price I'm going to pay for dreaming
Now that you're dream has come true

Tell my how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
and how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been living for is gone
