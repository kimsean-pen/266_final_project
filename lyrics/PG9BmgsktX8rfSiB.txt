I feel a lack of remorse.
My kindness has run it's course.
You're down on your knees.
Just get away from me, please.
The sensuality.
This moment is lost on me.
I have the right to be loved.
I gave you all I had.
Maybe I'm a victim or it's true, that I spoil things when I'm through.
Maybe I'm addicted to the strain. (?????)
Uncalculated kindness.
It's very hard to find it.
You're down on your knees.
Just get away from me, please.
