Happy life, with the machines scattered around the room
Look what they made, they made it for me - happy technology
Outside, the lions roam, feeding on remains
We'll never leave, look at us now, so in love with the way we are

Here, the world that the children made
The world that the children made, here
The world that the children made, here
The world that the children made

Every night, they rock us to sleep - digital family
Is it real, or is it a dream? Can you believe the machines?
Outside, the beating sun, can you hear the screams?
We'll never leave, look at us now, so in love with the way we are

Here, the world that the children made
The world that the children made, here
The world that the children made, here
The world that the children made

Here, the world that the children made
Here, the world that the children made

Happy life, with the machines scattered around the room
Look what they made, they made it for me - happy technology
Outside, the lions roam, feeding on remains
We'll never leave, look at us now, so in love with the way we are

Here, the world that the children made
The world that the children made, here
The world that the children made, here
The world that the children made

Here, the world that the children made
Here, the world that the children made
