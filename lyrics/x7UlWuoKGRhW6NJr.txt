The suckers lose themselves
In the games they learn to play
Children love to sing
But then their voices slowly fade away
People always take a step away from what is true
That's why I like you around
I want you

Oh you do
You do
You do
You do
You do
You do
You do
You do
You make me want you

An open invitation to the dance
Happen stance set the vibe that we are in
No apology because my urge is genuine
And the mystery of your rhythm is so feminine
Here I am and I want to take a hit
Of your scent 'cause it gets so deep into my soul
Ooh, I want you

Yea you do
You do
You do
You do
You do
You do
You do
You do
You make me want you

Oh you do
You do
You do
You do
You do
You do
You do
You do
I want you

And I can't get enough
You, you, you, you
And I can't get enough
And I can't get enough
Oh oh ah ah ah

The village churchyard is filled with bones
Weeping in the grave
The silver lining of clouds
Shines on people, Jesus couldn't save
You want to know
How deeply my soul goes
Deeper than bones
Deeper than bones

And I can't get enough
I, I, I, I, I
And I can't get enough
And I can't get enough
You, you, you, you, you
And I can't get enough

After we did it by the windowsill
Smoke rings drifted through the midnight sky
Presently in the quilt that your mother made
A bare candle burns to fight off the gloom
You said to live this way is not for the meek
Send me all your vampires
And like a jazz DJ you talk me into sleep
I said there will be no regrets when the worms come
Send me all your vampires
And they shall surely come

Oh you do
You do
You do
You do
You do
You do
You do
You do
Make me want you
Send me all your vampires

Yea, I do
I do
I do
You do
You do
You do
You do
You do
A make me want you
Send me all your vampires

I want you
Send me all your vampires
I want you
Send me all your vampires
Send me all your vampires
There will be no regrets when the worms come
Send me all your vampires
