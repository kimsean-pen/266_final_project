My Mama saidAnnotate "always look out for yourself
Don't give into anyone else"
And I never did baby
The trouble is the second that I tasted your lips
Its all over, you got my heart in a twist
And that ain't right baby

And its not fair cuz when your not there
I'm so emotionally needy baby
Ohh hoping no one can see me baby
You got me so pathetic

Time was Id be turning every head in the place
Now I'm just a waste of space
And its all on you baby
And it's all

And its sad when times are bad
I'm so emotionally needy baby
Ohh hoping no one can see me baby
You got me so pathetic
And it's not fair cuz when you're not there
I'm so emotionally needy baby
I'm hoping no one can see me baby
You got me so pathetic

It's so sad when time are bad
It's so sad when times are bad
It's so sad when times are bad
It's so sad when times are bad
When times are bad

And its sad when times are bad
I'm so emotionally needy baby
Ohh hoping no one can see me baby
You got me so pathetic
And it's not fair cuz when you're not there
I'm so emotionally needy baby
I'm hoping no one can see me baby
You got me so pathetic

And its sad when times are bad
I'm so emotionally needy baby
Ohh hoping no one can see me baby
You got me so pathetic
And it's not fair cuz when you're not there
I'm so emotionally needy baby
I'm hoping no one can see me baby
You got me so pathetic
