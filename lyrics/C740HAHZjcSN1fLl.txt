Open up my thoughts:
tell me if you see
some meaning.
Oh take me all apart.
Oh so that i can see
the pieces.
And I could walk for miles.
And on every street's
the same scene.
Follow the telephone wire
until I feel there's air
beneath me.
Oh if you don't mind,
would you show to me
the missing?
Oh with my weak eyes
I will only see
the missing.
Open up my heart.
Tell me if you see
some meaning.
Oh take me all apart,
so that i can see
the bleeding.
Oh if you don't mind,
could you show to me
the missing?
Oh with my weak eyes
I will only see
the missing.
And I would understand
(I would understand)
if you showed to me
the missing.
And I could understand
(I could understand)
if you showed to me
the missing.
And I would understand
(I'd understand)
if you showed to me
the missing.
