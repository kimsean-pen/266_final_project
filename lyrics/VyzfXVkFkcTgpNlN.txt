I wish I could
count on you to be mine

But here I'm not crying
I'm just glad to be alive

Time will turn the tide

Time will turn the tide

Time will turn the tide

You never noticed
Never cared or never knew

And, oh, heartbreaker
did you think I was a fool?

Time will turn the tide

Time will turn the tide

Time will turn the tide
