Woman:
When you're dreaming, you feel alive.

Demonic Voice:
The truth is so black. Once more, this is the message. Our way of reasoning
gives way for our notable hour.This has always been.

The light pours over me as I run for cover. They tried to pull me in, but I was
already there.

Woman:
Oh I had this dream one night I was like lying on my stupid futon couch foldout
bed. And it was like really hot it just started summer, and um it was really
hot. I had like no fan or anything. I was lying there and I had this weirdest
weirdest weirdest like nightmare. I had this nightmare where they're like
dreams but they're not dreams they're real ya know you feel as though you're
alive when you're dreaming, you think you're alive when you're dreaming. I had
this dream where this angel was coming up, like up my fire escape cause I don't
have bars on my windows cause I don't believe in bars on my windows. And she
was there in my room I was lying there and she came and she kissed me and I
woke up and I looked at Tom. Do you believe in angels?

Demonic voice:
No.
