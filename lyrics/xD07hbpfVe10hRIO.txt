Shameless halo
I think you forgot love along the way
Shameless halo
Where does your heart go when you pray?

I know what your prophet meant
But every time you vent
Sweet honey turns to poison

Shameless Halo
You believe in heaven, why are you so afraid?
Shameless halo

There's a victim card that you play
When you don't get your way
You judge other peoples choices
You'd silence different voices

Shameless Halo
Where does your heart go when you pray?

You call it the book of love
You're swinging it like a club
Sweet honey turns to poison

I watch what you say and do
I can't stand the tone of your tune
Sweet honey turns to poison
