The Hare once betrayed me
And so did the Fox and the Crow
Just once defied me
There's me and there's Space
Where are they?
Maybe dead
No one knows
You can't defy me

Ride all along
With me
There's no tomorrow
Now let me through
And wait for my command

Don't try to be cruel
Oh, my beautiful child
But how can you try to redeem the past?
It's not real as it seems
Now ride on your wave
And get back to that place
Scratch deeper and deeper
And soon I will be on my own

The gods will ignore your end
They'll defend the elder
The lords won't salute you
The saints they won't save you
They'll defend their guardian
The savior won't heal your soul

Caesar
No man's world
It's the Ides of March
Then from the ashes of eternity
A new spirit will rise
A new order shall take over

Now
Raise the flag
The war seems over
And bow your head
At dawn they sall be murdered

Woes, I will not complain
The further you get
The closer's the end, dear

But now
I will try
Come and see
That things are not what they may seem

It's all written down
The savior lies bleeding
But he won't surrender
The scriptures don't lie
He'll e turned around
No one to blame

It all goes down

The gods will ignore your end
They'll defend the elder
The lords won't salute you
The saints they won't save you
They'll defend their guardian
The savior won't heal your soul

Now go and get
Your holy grail
And don't forget
Just once you'll cross the border

Now let the saints
The saints come marching in
Whatever you'll do
Do it fast
My sweet son of decay
Now let the saints
The saints come marching in
Transform
You may pass
Rearrange it
Now change to betray

I won't lie
While bright eyes are turing pale
Your sands run low

Your light shines
My last try
It'll soon be over

No sign shall be given for ages and more
You may enter first
But from now you will be on your own

The gods will ignore your end
They'll defend the elder
The lords won't salute you
The saints they won't save you
They'll defend their guardian
The savior won't heal your soul

You're getting your grail
But there's no place to go
Longing for a new shore
Eastern winds they blow cold
The saints you will bring them down
The savior won't take the crown
Let my spirit fly
Let it fly
