Welcome to the circus
Leave your brain outside
Sit back - relax
As we feed you lies

Spoon fed stimulation
Glittering fashion fascination
You are lost in the game
Media corruption

You'll be amused
By the things we do to you
But in the bitter end
The clown is you

End of the line
You sold your soul
For a better life
You're better off dead

You had one life
You had one shot
You blew it
And you knew it

The rot sets in
No self control
At the end of the line
You play the fool

You'll be amused
By the things we do to you
But in the bitter end
The clown is you

End of the line
You sold your soul
For a better life
You're better off dead

End Of The Line
You're better off dead

End of the line
You sold your soul
For a better life
You're better off dead

End Of The Line
You're better off dead

End Of The Line
