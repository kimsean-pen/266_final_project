I don't know how I got here but I refuse to stay
I betrayed myself when I let others have their way
But I am holding on, my finger on the pulse
The sound of my heart pounding tells me there's still hope

But people don't like when you put up a fight
And slowly, ever so slowly, I am losing mine

I'll fight, fight, fight or be taken out alive, fight
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Standing on the edge, am I better off dead?
How could I forget that I'm better than this?

I've come too far to fade tonight
Fight or be taken out alive

My thoughts are racing faster than my body can react
The danger doesn't register, the fear feels like an act
Don't pull the plug, I swear this isn't how I want to go
The sound of my heart pounding tells me there's still hope

But people don't like when you put up a fight
And slowly, ever so slowly, I am losing mine

I'll fight, fight, fight or be taken out alive, fight
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Standing on the edge, am I better off dead?
How could I forget that I'm better than this?

I've come too far to fade tonight
Fight or be taken out alive

I've survived on life support
But I'm stronger than I give myself credit for
These conditions only cure
When we prepare ourselves for war

I've survived on life support
But I'm stronger than I give myself credit for
These conditions only cure
When we prepare ourselves for war
I'll fight, fight, fight or be taken out alive, fight
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Standing on the edge, am I better off dead?
How could I forget that I'm better than this?
I've come too far to fade tonight
Fight or be taken out alive
