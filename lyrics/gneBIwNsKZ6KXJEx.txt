I've got a pocket full of pretty green
I'm going to put it in the fruit machine
I'm going to put it in the juke box
It's going to play all the records in the hit parade

I've got a pocket full of pretty green
I'm going to give it to the man behind the counter
He's going to give me food and water
I'm gonna eat that and look for more

This is the pretty green
This is society
You can't do nothing
Unless it's in the pocket, oh no

I've got a pocket full of pretty green
I'm going to put it in the fruit machine
I'm going to put it in the juke box
It's going to play all the records in the hit parade

This is the pretty green
This is society
You can't do nothing
Unless it's in the pocket, oh no

And they didn't teach me that in school
It's something that I learnt on my own
That power is measured by the pound or the fist
It's as clear as this, hey

I've got a pocket full of pretty green
I'm going to, I'm going to put it in the fruit machine
I'm going to put it in the juke, juke box
It's going to play all the records in the hit parade

I've got a pocket full of pretty green
I'm going to give it to the man behind the counter
He's going to give me food and water
I'm gonna eat that and look for more

This is the pretty green
This is society
You can't do nothing
Unless it's in the pocket, oh no
