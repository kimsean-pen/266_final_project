And we're never on time,
Laughing at the wrong time,
Laughing for a long time,
Think it's gonna be alright.

And we're never on time,
Laughing at the wrong time,
Laughing at the wrong thing,
Laughing for a long time,
Think it's gonna be alright.

We don't talk much but I hope that you're well,
Let's drive to the beach and play songs from 2012,
I've been meaning to text you for seven or eight days,
Get back from your vacay,
Meet me at HJ's,
We had like a million great days, at least,
And that's only since grade eight, I mean,
HSM like 2006,
I take all the blame for this Tokyo drift.

Weeks were getting super long and I was getting bored now,
Monday doesn't even feel like Monday anymore.
And everyone was always wrong, I'm glad that we ignored now,
Monday doesn't even feel like Monday anymore.

And we're never on time,
Laughing at the wrong time,
Laughing for a long time,
Think it's gonna be alright.

And we're never on time,
Laughing at the wrong time,
Laughing at the wrong thing,
Laughing for a long time,
