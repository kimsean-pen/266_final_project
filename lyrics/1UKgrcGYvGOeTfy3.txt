Stuck in a hole, enslaved by emptiness
Fist clenched tight, though I'm not alone
They're always here, controlling my thoughts
Every sense, every sound, every image, abstract
They're all around, watching me die
Free will, obsolete, intention unknown
This is the day, the day I'll try
'Cause this is the day, the day I die

This is the day, the day I die
All pain undone, all pain is gone

Come set me free, all pain is gone
Come set me free, all pain is gone
All pain undone, all pain is gone
Come set me free, all pain is gone

And it's never enough, the story never ends
A chapter is closed, another one's revealed
Razorblade love, I can taste the peace
Another day gone, another chapter complete
They're all alone, watching me die
Free will obsolete, intention unknown
This is the day, the day I'll try
'Cause this is the day, the day I die

Come set me free, all pain is gone
Come set me free, all pain is gone
All pain undone, all pain is gone
Come set me free, all pain is gone

Come set me free, all pain is gone
Come set me free, all pain is gone
All pain undone, all pain is gone
Come set me free, all pain is gone
