She was the end of ruins
a full rush of air
A reason for removing
the lock from the door

But who could hope to know
what she does and where she goes?
You might learn to
take her

As she is
As she will be

SOPHIE
SOPHIE

Your double in many ways
But only one of you
can pull the strings

To be the guest
To be the other one
Is it so
Is it so bad?
You're starting to understand
her

How she is
How she will be

SOPHIE
SOPHIE

Everybody knows
Everybody knows
who she is
who she will be

SOPHIE
