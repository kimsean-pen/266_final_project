At magic mountain
Nobody sings today
Nobody speaks today
Close my eyes
And hope to see
Weeks go by like a day
In a lowland

I live up on magic mountain
No one leaves magic mountain

At magic mountain
Nothing changes
Everything stays the same
Cross my heart
And hope to leave
All the time
With a little fever

I stay here on magic mountain
No one leaves magic...

My heart hears you sing
My heart sees you speak
But I never make it in the flatlands
I must stay on magic mountain
