Let me be the one

Some sleepless night if you should find yourself alone

Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to
Let me be the one

To set things right
When this whole world's turned upside down

Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to
(need someone to turn to)
Let me be the one

For love and understanding, to find a quiet place
For silent understanding, a loving touch
Come to me when things go wrong
And there's no love to light the way

Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to
(need someone to turn to)
Let me be the one

Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to
(need someone to turn to)

Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to
(need someone to turn to)

Let me be the one you run to
Let me be the one you come to
When you need someone to turn to

Let me be the one
Figure out whether us to now or years
I'll sing it it
