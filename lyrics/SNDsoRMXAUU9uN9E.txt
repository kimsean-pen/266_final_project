This is our time
What to look for
This is our time
Nothing more
Look to the sky
I cannot help you
It all melts away
In our drug addict minds

All who cares, who cares
All who cares, who cares

Give me your hand
And lets take it
Give me your hand
And we dance to the end

All who cares, who cares
All who cares
What's on the other side

You and me
Alone at sea
And I know
We know
This is suicide
You can see
It's you and me
So hold on hold on
To it's suicide

Give me your hand
And lets take it
Give me your hand
And we dance to the end

All who cares, who cares
All who cares
What's on the other side

You and me
Alone at sea
And I know
We know
This is suicide
You can see
It's you and me
So hold on hold on
To it's suicide
