Help me surrender my control
Searching for the death of my own soul
I bleed from far beneath
My cover keeps, the rest from leaking

I'm bleeding on the inside
Fear before the fall
Six feet above the next time
I lose it all

Keep your silence or reach for life beyond the stars
Save your mercy, for someone who needs it more
I'm the guilty, all the feelings come crashing down on me
I'm taking you with me!

Help me, I'm losing on my own
Locked up in a cage and not alone
Show me a way to keep
The hate from taking control of breaking

I'm bleeding on the inside
Fear before the fall
Six feet above the next time
I lose it all

Keep your silence or reach for life beyond the stars
Save your mercy, for someone who needs it more

I'm the guilty, all the feelings come crashing down on me
I'm taking you with me!

Keep your silence or reach for life beyond the stars
Save your mercy, for someone who needs it more
You're the jury, all that's buried
Come crashing down on me
I'm taking you with me!

I'm taking you with me.

Keep your silence or reach for life beyond the stars
Save your mercy, for someone who needs it more
I'm the guilty, all the feelings come crashing down on me
I'm taking you with me!
Keep your silence
Taking you with me
Save your Mercy
For someone who needs it more
I'm the guilty
All the feelings come crashing down on me
I'm, taking you with me.
