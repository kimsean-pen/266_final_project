Wine is lovely, but it's making my legs shake
sad and stoned let it stay alone
cause we belong to live right though it's riding our own strength
where were we when these souls had eyes

cause you're a street angel house devil
leadin' so right
you're a street angel house devil
leadin so right

and there's no light underneath you underneath you
no there's no light underneath you underneath you

how long to live right when it's right at our arms' length
sad and stoned let it stay a lone
cause we belong to live right though it's right at our arms' length
all the love receded all my money's gone

cause you're a street angel house devil
leadin' so right
yeah you're a street angel house devil
leadin' so right

and there's no light underneath you underneath you
oh there's no light underneath you underneath you

I just want my money to say.
I just want my money to say...
I just want my money to say...
it will never leave so suddenly again

cause you're a street angel house devil
leadin' so right
yeah you're a street angel house devil
leadin' so right

and there's no light underneath you underneath you
now there's no light underneath you underneath you
ah there's no light underneath you underneath you
and there's no light underneath you underneath you
