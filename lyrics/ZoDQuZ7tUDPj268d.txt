I think I've walked too close to love
And now I'm falling in
There's so many things this weary soul can't take
Maybe you just caught me by surprise
The first time that I looked into your eyes

There's a life inside of me
That I can feel again
It's the only thing that takes me
Where I've never been
I don't care if I lost everything that I have known
It don't matter where I lay my head tonight
Your arms feel like home
They feel like home

This life ain't the fairy tale we both thought it would be
But I can see your smiling face as it's staring back at me
I know we both see these changes now
I know we both understand somehow

There's a life inside of me
That I can feel again
It's the only thing that takes me
Where I've never been
I don't care if I lost everything that I have known
It don't matter where I lay my head tonight
Your arms feel like home
(Hold on, you're home to me)
They feel like home

(Just hold on, you're home to me)
There's a life inside of me
That I can feel again
(They feel like home)
It's the only thing that takes me
Where I've never been
(They feel like home)
I don't care if I lost everything that I have known
(They feel like home)
It don't matter where I lay my head tonight
Your arms feel like home
They feel like home
They feel like home
