We close our eyes

Close them in your dreams

I'm here to stay
They don't go away
You don't need me
I'll slip away
You can't hear me
I'm not the same

You're hoping that I'm not here

And I'm slipping through your open mouth
Open through your door

Shut the door

Control, I'm here

I've got a dream

Grinding in your head
Grinding in your chest
I've got control
I've got to go

Get this

Come on to me

Come inside your home
Come inside your dreams
I'm here to stay
I won't go away
You don't need me
I'll slip away
You can't hear me
I'm not the same

You're hoping that I'm not here

And I'm slipping through your open mouth

Shut the door

Control, I'm here

Shine on to me
Shining in your hands
Shining in my head

I've got control
I've got to go

Shut the door

Start it up

Slipping through my open mouth
Slipping through my fingertips
