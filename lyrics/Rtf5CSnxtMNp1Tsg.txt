Little girl, you like it loud
Come alive in the middle of a crowd
You wanna scream, you wanna shout
Get excited when the lights go down

At the rock show
You'll be right in the front row
Heart and soul, they both know
It's where you gotta be

Little girl, there you are
All the lighters looking just like stars
Sing along, feel the sound
Take a ride on the hands of the crowd
And here it comes, the moment when
You know you'll never be the same again
Power chord, you see the light
You found your place in the world tonight

At the rock show
You'll be right in the front row
Heart and soul, they both know
It's where you gotta be
Yeah at the rock show
Getting high on the solo
So what if it's crazy?
That's gonna be me

This goes out to anyone
Who's heart beats like a kick drum
When a bitchin' riff comes
Knows the words to every line, everytime
And you know you gotta go
And get some, get pumped
Find yourself and lose it

At the rock show
I'm lookin at the front row
Heart and soul, we both know
It's where we gotta be
Yeah at the rock show
We're reaching for the high notes
(We're reaching for the high notes)
Don't matter if we're crazy
You're coming with me
You're coming with me
You're coming with me
So what if it's crazy?
It's where we gotta be
At the rock show
