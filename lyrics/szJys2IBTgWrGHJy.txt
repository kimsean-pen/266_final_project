Graduates of tablature, a bouquet of garages
Put a snout to those mirages, inhaling till we bust
I'm sixteen and I'm unit, our instruments can do it
Every house show that we blew it, you couldn't get to us

As fever slips the ill into bouts of shivering
So do my vivid out-of-body sweat-glossed bleatings
Witness close distance with your loudest feelings
Come free in camradery

As fever slips the ill into bouts of shivering
So do my vivid out-of-body sweat-glossed bleatings
Witness close distance with your loudest feelings
Come free in camaraderie

While the rapture is young
Dote on the friends of your love
The least we suffer is with each other

Bedlam, but spun in a loom
From silks of the Moon go the bands of my youth
My loose performing body has all remaining moves
Flaunting my camaraderie in groups

As fever slips the ill into bouts of shivering
So do my vivid out-of-body sweat-glossed bleatings
Witness close distance with your loudest feelings
Come free in camaraderie

As fever slips the ill into bouts of shivering
So do my vivid out-of-body sweat-glossed bleatings
Witness close distance with your loudest feelings
Come free in camaraderie

While the rapture is young
Dote on the friends of your love
