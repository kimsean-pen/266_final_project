There was a time and place where I never thought
I'd leave my own hometown
but those days finally are dead and gone
It was never my intention to stay there
Oh no

There was a concious effort played by me
to disown anything I see
There was a girl I knew way back when
who says she doesn't know me anymore

These are the lies, the things you never mention
These are my past mistakes I'll stay away from

These are my thoughts written down on paper,
It's my only savior
from not saying what I want to say.
These are the thoughts that are on my mind
Moments that haven't yet been defined
And I don't know if you could ever understand
These are the things I can't say when were alone.

There were countless hours on the telephone
My ears were ringing from the dial tone,
There were flashing lights, people staring
There was nothing I could ever do,

These are the lies, the things you never mention
These are my past mistakes I'll stay away from

This is the truth
The only time you'll hear it
I write it down because it seems so hard to say it,

These are my thoughts written down on paper
It's my only savior
from not saying what I want to say
There are my thoughts that are on my mind
Moments that haven't yet been defined
And I don't know if you could ever understand
These are the things I can't say when we're alone.
