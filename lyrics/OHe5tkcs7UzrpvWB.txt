Son of God be no more,
Weak and self-defeating,
Humiliating and enslaving,
Hypocritical in servitude.

For those who enjoy,
Pointless obedience,
Thralldom for the lost,
Smothering the flame.

You are mere Worms,
Following false Prophet,
Delusional Messiah,
To Labyrinths of Madness.

Spit on Jesus Christ,
The Father of Lies,
Onwards on the Path,
To the Place of Skull,
Crucified to the Cross,
Three Nails ate the Flesh.

Weak on Spirit and Mind,
The Father of Lies.

For those who enjoy,
Pointless obedience,
Thralldom for the lost,
Smothering the flame,
You are mere Worms,
Following false Prophet,
To Labyrinths of Madness.
