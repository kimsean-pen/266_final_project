Open your eyes
I'm right in front of you
Open your eyes

Open your eyes
I'm walking out on you for the last time

I keep my heart aching
Why do we keep fakin'

I was only lying when I looked in your eyes, I'm
Cryin' diamonds like a river inside, and it's
So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
I was only lyin' when I looked in your eyes
Now I'm lyin' with you one last time, and it's
So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy

Don't turn around
I'm not the one for you
Don't turn around

I keep my heart achin', why
Don't I have the guts to break it

I was only lying when I looked in your eyes, I'm
Cryin' diamonds like a river inside, and it's
So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
I was only lyin' when I looked in your eyes
Now I'm lyin' with you one last time, and it's
So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy

So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy

All the words are so worth (so worth)
So I dance, but I don't feel it

Darlin', I was only lyin' when I looked in your eyes, I'm
Cryin' diamonds like a river inside, and it's
So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
I was only lyin' when I looked in your eyes
Now I'm lyin' with you one last time, and it's
So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy

So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
So sad, so sexy
