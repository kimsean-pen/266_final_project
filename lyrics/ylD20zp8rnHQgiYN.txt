The Ice Man's mule is parked
Outside the bar
Where a man with missing fingers
Plays a strange guitar
And the German dwarf
Dances with the butcher's son
And tonight a little rain never hurt no one
They're dancing on the roof

And the ceiling's coming down
I sleep with my shovel and my leather gloves
A little trouble makes it worth the going
And a little rain never hurt no one
The world is round

And so I'll go around
You must risk something that matters
My hands are strong
I'll take any man here
If it's worth the going
It's worth the ride
She was 15 years old

And never seen the ocean
She climbed into a van
With a vagabond
And the last thing she said
Was, "I love you mom."
And a little rain
Never hurt no one
And a little rain
Never hurt no one
