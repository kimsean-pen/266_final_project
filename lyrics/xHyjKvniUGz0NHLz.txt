The places i would love to see
Places where i'd rather be
It's so great to build up passionate stories

Under my kooky sun
Under my kooky sun

It's not easy to be so romantic
Completely mine
Completely yours
You choose me like a book
Turn pages day after day
Discovering the fairy tale

Under my kooky sun
Under my kooky sun

You were here to make me feel so alive
I'm alive I'm alive

Prediction destiny
This place I wanted to see
You catched me like a book
Skipping chapters by the wind

I let my fantasy overflow
Once again
I knew it had a beginning
I forgot it had an end
It had an end

Under my kooky sun
Under my kooky sun

You were here to make me feel so alive
I'm alive I'm alive
I'm alive I'm alive
