Merciless beyond reason
Sent alone to bare this terrible sin
Expected betrayal stings
Second loop begins

Flittering shrapnel rattles like a jar of teeth
The thrum and cacophony of insane bees
Corpses cork screw on fire
Inside a perfect vacuum

E-K-G
Can't see my wounds
The wolf never questions
The wolf only kills

The plate caught the round
But inside I'm still bathed in shrapnel
With concentration absent of doubt
Revel in the unimaginable slaughter
