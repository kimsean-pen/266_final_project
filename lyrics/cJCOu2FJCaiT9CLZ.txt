She said she'd never believed in the idea of fate
No love at first sight stories
I wasn't her soul mate
When she collapsed I thought she was joking
But she didn't get up again, she didn't get up again

A thousand flowers, a hundred cards to say
She's in a better place, she's in a better place

Just face it, just face it, you can't let go
(I can't be spoken for anymore)
Just face it, just face it, you're on your own
(I gave up everything I know)
It carries on, it never stops
(How could I go on without, how could I go on without)
Just face it, just face it, you can't let go
You can't let go

She always said I was way too safe and I never could have fun
I had to make few mistakes and get into trouble while I'm young
So we broke in to the old train station
And danced away the night until the cops chased us away
It breaks my heart to think she's in a better place

Just face it, just face it, you can't let go
(I can't be spoken for anymore)
Just face it, just face it, you're on your own
(I gave up everything I know)
It carries on, it never stops
(How could I go on without, how could I go on without)
Just face it, just face it, you can't let go
You can't let go

You can't let go
Just face it, just face it

One day I took off my ring to see if the memory would start to fade
The time I spent away I wasted all those days
She's in a better place, she's in a better place

Just face it, just face it, you can't let go
(I can't be spoken for anymore)
Just face it, just face it, you're on your own
(I gave up everything I know)
It carries on, it never stops
(How could I go on without, how could I go on without)
Just face it, just face it, you can't let go
You can't let go

You can't let... go
Just face it, just face it
If I could, I'd trade with you
If I could, I would
