I know my dear I got us here
But I'm seeing things like I never saw before
My heart is like a powder keg and it blew and burned us both and left you sore

But I'm not afraid to say I think you're wrong to think we're through
Don't throw away our lives on this
Last month was hard I do admit
But the hardest road pays off the most
And I love you more and more each day
And when we fight there's still a way
'Cause you're my rock if I'm still yours

And I never meant to say the things I said when I'm upset and need to vent
But now I'm this close to losing you
I swear I'll never make you sad again

And I'm not afraid to say I think you're wrong to think we're through
Don't throw away our lives on this
Last month was hard I do admit
The hardest road pays off the most
And I love you more and more each day
And when we fight there's still a way
'Cause you're my rock if I'm still yours

I know that I promised not to call
But princess, I needed you to know
That I'd give anything for one more day
To stand beside you at your throne
I'm not cut out to face this world alone

Don't throw away our lives on this
Last month was hard I do admit
The hardest road pays off the most
And I love you more and more each day
When we fight there's still a way
'Cause you're my rock if I'm still yours
