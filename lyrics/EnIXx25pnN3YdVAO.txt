I like the way you never sleep
And the promises you never keep
I like the way you say hello
And make it sound like time to go
I like the scar above your lip
The way you let your feelings slip
But they are never what you feel
Oh so fake, but completely real

Don't you think it's weird
Weirder than weird
That's what you are
That's what you wanna be
What I like about you is what you like about me
Don't you think it's weird

You like the rules that don't apply
And let the good things pass you by
Standing there, without a plan
That's why you're such a happy man

Don't you think it's weird
Weirder than weird
That's what you are
That's what you wanna be
What I like about you is what you like about me
Don't you think it's
One, two

I wanna make some changes
I want my money back
I want to start up again, yeah
I want to talk to strangers
I want to be with you
But I just dont know
Where and when

That's what you are
That's what you wanna be
What I like about you is what you like about me
Don't you think its weird
Weirder than weird
That's what you are
That's what you wanna be
What I like about you is what you like about me
Dont you think its weird
