I got lost in the dark
On the trail of your fading heart
All these dreams left to die
On our way to a broken sky
I see what we left and the bridge is about to burn
A step and I reach for your soul, there is no return

When angels fall
(Fall, fall, fall into the never
When angels fall
Come, come, come into the never)
When angels fall
(Fall, fall, fall into the never
When angels fall
Come, come, come into the never)
When angels fall, will you hear us
We've fallen from heavens shore
(Come, come, come into the never)
When angels fall into ashes and dust
Will you hear us call
(Come, come, come into the never)

When angels fall

You are far, but somehow
You're still holding the darkness out
Where you are, I'm with you
I'm still hearing the voice I knew
From shadows to hallows, the bridge is about to burn
You're love all that mattered to me, there is no return

When angels fall
(Fall, fall, fall into the never
When angels fall
Come, come, come into the never)
When angels fall
(Fall, fall, fall into the never
When angels fall
Come, come, come into the never)

When angels fall
(Fall, fall, fall into the never
When angels fall
Come, come, come into the never)
When angels fall
(Fall, fall, fall into the never
When angels fall
Come, come, come into the never)

When angels fall, will you hear us
We've fallen from heavens shore
(Come, come, come into the never)
When angels fall into ashes and dust
Will you hear us call
(Come, come, come into the never)
When angels fall
