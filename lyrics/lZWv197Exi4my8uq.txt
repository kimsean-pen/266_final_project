I'm Electra, I'm Electra Heart
Eh, only living, living in the dark
Lights, they blind me
Can we go back, go back to the start
Where the Holy Father made his mark?
Lights, they blind me

Can we go back?
Li-i-i... Li-i-i-i...
Lights, they blind me

For forgiveness, you could always pray
Eh, that the sickness, it could go away
Lights, they blind me
At the altar, would you pay the price?
Would you give your, would you give your life?
Lights, they blind me

For forgiveness
Li-i-i... Li-i-i-i...
Lights, they blind me

Lights, they blind me
Li-i-i... Li-i-i-i...
Lights, they blind me
