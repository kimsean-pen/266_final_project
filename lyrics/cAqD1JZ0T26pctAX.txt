Oh The Weather Outside Is Frightful
But The Fire Is So Delightful
Since We've No Place To Go
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow

It Doesn't Show Signs of Stopping
And I've Brought Some Corn For Popping
The Lights Are Turned Down Low
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow

When We Finally Kiss Goodbear
How I'll Hate Going Out In A Storm
But As Long As You Hold Me Near
All The Way Home I'll Be Warm

The Fire Is Slowly Dying
And My Dear We're Still Goodbying
As Long As You Love Me So
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow

(Backup Voices)

He Doesn't Care If It's In Below
He's Sitting By The Fires Gloosy Glow
He Don't Care About The Cold And The Winds That Blow
He Just Says, Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow

(Frank) Let It Snow!

(Backup Voices)

Oooooh Wee Goes The Storm
Why Should He Worry When He's Nice And Warm
His Girl By His Side And The Lights Turned Low
He Just Says, Let It Snow, Let It Snow

(Frank) I Don't Care!

(Frank)

The Weather Outside Is Frightful
But That Fire Is Ummm. Delightful
Since We've No Place To Go
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow

It Doesn't Show Signs Of Stopping
And I've Brought Lots Of Corn For Popping
The Lights Are Way Down Low
So Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow

(Backup Voices) Let It Snow!

(Frank)

When We've Finally Say Goodnight
How I'll Hate Going Out In A Storm
But If You'll Only Hold Me Tight
All The Way Home I'll Be Warm

The Fire Is Slowly Dying
And My Dear We're Still Goodbying
Long As You Love Me So
Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow!
