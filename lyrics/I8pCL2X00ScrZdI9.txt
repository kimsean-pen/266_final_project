I don't understand the pain
I just don't feel quite the same
When you hear them walk away
Left you here so you can stay

Silver's just another gold
When you're bitter and you're old
You could tell me anything
But not what the future brings

Silver's just another gold
Silver's just another gold
Silver's just another gold
