Freak like me, freak like me
You a freak like me freak-freak like me-me
Freak like me, freak like me
You a freak like me, freak like me
Freak like me, freak like me
You a freak like me, freak-freak like me
(La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la)
Freak like me, freak like me, you a freak like me
(La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la)
You a freak like me, freak like-like me
Freak like me, freak-freak like me
Sitting pretty on the top watching all you wantin' money
Do you know where you give up, when you fear my voice on TV
Got money, money, money goes, turn it up and turn it down
Coming out with nothin' ooh, tell me when you hit the ground
Just this once I let you go, 'fore you walk you pass the ground
And you don't know, oh no no you don't know
What you want you'll never stop, guess that means you made it honey
You're famous for what? It matters more that
You look good in Photoshop, you're still tan when it's not sunny
Keep flyin' higher,? as a tiger
It's funny, funny, funny though, now we buy it by the pound
Comes another puppy ooh, give a smile and turn around
How far will you let it go, it's a game of pleasure now
And you don't know, oh no no you don't know
If you will, there's no need then to lay down
Why could you not stand, take a chance now, oh
