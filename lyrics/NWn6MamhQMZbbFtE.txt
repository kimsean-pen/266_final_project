I need nobody to notice me
Never wanna get completed
I need my picture in a magazine
So I know that you will talk to me
I feel it from my head down to my feet
Can somebody talk to me?
Is anybody more than eighteen
When they heard it in a magazine?
Call call call a-call me over
Cause I I can't stay awake
Call call call a-call me over
Cause I I can't stay awake
I need nobody to notice me
Never wanna get completed
I need my picture in a magazine
So I know that you will talk to me
I feel it from my head down to my feet
Can somebody talk to me?
Is anybody more than eighteen
When they heard it in a magazine?
Call call call a-call me over
Cause I I can't stay awake
Call call call a-call me over
Cause I I can't stay awake
Call call call a-call me over
Cause I I can't stay awake
Call call call a-call me over
Cause I I can't stay awake
