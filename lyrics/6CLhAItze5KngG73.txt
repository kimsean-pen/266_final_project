Oh the heads that turn
Make my back burn
And those heads that turn
Make my back, make my back burn

The sparkle in your eyes
Keeps me alive
And the sparkle in your eyes
Keeps me alive, keeps me alive

And the world
And the world turns around
The world, and the world, yeah
The world drags me down

Well the heads that turn
Make my back burn
And those heads that turn
Make my back, make my back burn, yeah
Yeah-ah-ah-ah
Yeah-ah-ah-ah

The fire in your eyes
Keeps me alive
And the fire in your eyes
Keeps me alive

I'm sure in her you'll find
The sanctuary
I'm sure in her you'll find
The sanctuary

And the world
The world turns around
And the world, and the world
The world drags me down

And the world, and the world, and the world
The world turns around
And the world, and the world, and the world, and the world
The world drags me down
Hey-yeah-ah-ah
Hey-yeah-ah-ah
And the world
And the world turns around
And the world, and the world
Yeah, the world drags me down
And the world
Yeah, the world turns around
And the world, and the world
The world drags me down
Sanctuary
