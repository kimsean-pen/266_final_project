It's superficial the way that you listen
Open your ears and your mind
Just take the time to
Look a bit deeper
You'd be surprised what you find inside
We're only human
That makes it simple
But all our lines are complex
And it's fine
It's fine

Can you read my mind
Or can you read my heart
Cause they are one in the same
Your good intentions are paved with?
Heaven and earth are one in the same
