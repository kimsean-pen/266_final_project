Is it horrible?
Is it bearable?

Is it horrible?

Seems like you had a rough one last night - ha - ha - ha - ha - ha
Since you slept dirty on my bathroom floor

What if I told you, what if I told you something terrible happened last night?
Would you remember? Could you remember? Would you remember? Could you remember?

Seems like you had a good night
You don't know when to stop drinking till you drop.
And the morning don't feel too bright,
Your head's on fire and the pain don't feel too nice.
Your eyes were all over the joint

Your head's on fire and the pain don't feel too nice.
Your eyes were all over the joint

But I got your back buddy.
