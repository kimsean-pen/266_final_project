Nothing but a heartbeat
You used to touch,
I used to feel.
The shivers down my neck when you kissed me,
Were they real?
You took the hope, left me empty.
And then you cry, Please, Please
But you and I bleed, bleed.
Nothing but a heartbeat!
I got no air in my lungs,
Got no bones in my body.
There's nothing left inside of me.
Nothing but a heartbeat.
They're only words, but words can kill.
You wonder when he hits you where it hurts,
Is he doing this for the thrill?
My limbs are numb and I can't feel a thing.
But still you try
Please, please
And you and I
Bleed, bleed ...
Nothing but a heartbeat!
Nothing but a heartbeat!
I got no air in my lungs,
Got no bones in my body.
There's nothing left inside of me.
Nothing but a heartbeat!
No love, no fear.
Nothing but a post left here.
Nothing but a heartbeat!
I got no air in my lungs,
Got no bones in my body,
There's nothing left inside of me.
Nothing but a heartbeat!
