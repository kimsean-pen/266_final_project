By the pool, there's a lot of pretty girls
But all I see is you
Laying down, taking up all of the sun
Save some for me
I know there's more layers to rip up off you
Grab a towel and meet me in the house
Dripping chocolate all over the bedroom
Drowning in your softly spoken sounds
I can't live without my brown
Fills me up with just the right amount
Easy on the soul, my brown
Wrap me in between, I want it now
Everybody love that cocoa brown
Grab my keys, you'll take the wheel
I keep it cool
I get my cash from out your chest
It's safe with you
I like it how you try to hold back but that don't last long
We driving too fast right past all the milestones
Pulled up on my pressure treated driveway
Touching 'fore we made it through the door
Raced you to my room, ran up the staircase
Opposite of you waits on the floor
No need for more
I can't live without my brown
Fills me up with just the right amount
Easy on the soul, my brown
Wrap me in between, I want it now
Everybody love that cocoa brown
Ooh baby
