Shining
Without cause
Every I
In every breath
Root
Unknown by time
Within
This ache of beyond
Wings in oceans vast
Swells in azure skies
Caring not for the ruse
Not for fear of Nothing(ness)
Shining in stars and stone
Unknown by time
This ache of beyond
Shining
Dreams
Of what
We are
Sown in fields of stars
Ablaze
In the heart
Of the beyond
Disguise
Of shadow and gold
This veil
Holds no sway
As we muse in the fray
The source ever remains
Shining
As it all falls away
Wings in oceans vast
Swells in azure skies
Caring not for the ruse
Not for fear of Nothing(ness)
Shining in stars and stone
Unknown by time
This ache of beyond
In stars and stone

Shining
Dreams
Of what
We are
Sown in fields of stars
Blaze
In the heart
Of the beyond
