Sitting in my bedroom tonight
Thinking of how to change your mind
Since you walked out of my life again
So I strike a pose and tilt my chin
And hold the light to suit my skin
Your favourite T-shirt on again

Counting hours, counting lies
And I smile

Taking pictures of myself, self, self
Taking pictures of myself, self, self
Guess I'm reaching out to be assured
All I wanted was to be adored

Now you're telling me I'm vain, vain, vain
But you don't feel my pain, pain, pain
Placing life upon the shelf, shelf shelf
Taking pictures of myself, self, self

Taking pictures of myself
Taking pictures of myself
Taking pictures of myself
Taking pictures of myself

I'll post it up in black and white
With a depressing quote on my life
So that you see what I'm going through
And this is desperation at its best
A conversation to be left
But all my pride was burnt by you

Counting days, counting takes
I'm away

Taking pictures of myself, self, self
Taking pictures of myself, self, self
Guess I'm reaching out to be assured
All I wanted was to be adored

Taking pictures of myself, self, self
Taking pictures of myself, self, self
Guess I'm reaching out to be assured
All I wanted was to be adored

Hey, what are you looking at?
Hey, what are you looking at?
Hey, what are you looking at?
Hey, what are you looking at?

Taking pictures of myself
(Hey, what you're looking at?)
Taking pictures of myself
(Hey, what you're looking at?)
Taking pictures of myself
(Hey, what you're looking at?)
Taking pictures of myself
(Hey, what you're looking at?)

Taking pictures of myself
Taking pictures of myself
Taking pictures of myself
Taking pictures of myself
