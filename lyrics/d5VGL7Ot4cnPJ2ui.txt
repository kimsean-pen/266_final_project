I'm gonna marry the night
I won't give up on my life
I'm a warrior queen
Live passionately tonight

I'm gonna marry the dark
Gonna make love to the stark
I'm a soldier to my own emptiness
I'm a winner

I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night

I'm gonna marry the night
I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explore

Ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night
Oh, ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night

I'm gonna lace up my boots
Throw on some leather and cruise
Down the street that I love
In my fishnet gloves, I'm a sinner

Then I'll go down to the bar
But I won't cry anymore
I'll hold my whiskey up high
Kiss the bartender twice, I'm a loser

I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night

I'm gonna marry the night
I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explore

Ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night
Oh, ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night

Nothing's too cool to take me from you
New York is not just a tan that you'll never loose
Love is the new denim or black
Skeleton guns are wedding bells in the attic
Get Ginger ready, climb to El Camino front
Won't poke holes in the seats with my heels
'Cause that's where we make love

Come on and run
Turn the car on and run

I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna burn a hole in the road
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explore

Ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night
Oh, ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night

Oh, ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night

I'm gonna marry (marry), marry (marry)
I'm gonna marry (marry), marry (marry)
Come on, come on

The night, the night, the night (I'm gonna)
The night, the night, the night (I'm gonna)
The night, the night, the night
The night, the night, the night
The night, the night, the night
