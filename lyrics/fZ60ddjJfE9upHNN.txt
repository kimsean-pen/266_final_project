I'm lonely, striding down the aisle
Something's off in me again
Dramatically I greet a child
My daddy be a single man

Oh no, no more
Oh no, no more
now

I cannot help but feel a tremor
When I buy oatmeal at the store
Because the radio is jammin'
I feel the pain and buy some corn
Everything the singer's saying
It tears my heart apart for sure
Sad supermarket song is playing
And it can never be unheard

My fridge is filled with meat and dairy
Stocked up on chocolate galore
A bunch of fruit is necessary
I'll go out later, get some more

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Yet again

I cannot help but feel a tremor
When I buy oatmeal at the store
Because the radio is jammin'
I feel the pain and buy some corn
Everything the singer's saying
It tears my heart apart for sure
Sad supermarket song is playing
And it can never be unheard

No more
No, no more
Sad supermarket song

I cannot help but feel a tremor
When I buy oatmeal at the store
Because the radio is jammin'
I feel the pain and buy some corn
Everything the singer's sayin'
It tears my heart apart for sure
Sad supermarket song is playing
And it can never be unheard
No, it can never be unheared
