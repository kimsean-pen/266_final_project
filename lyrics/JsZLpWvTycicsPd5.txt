I wish you could hurt me
Just a little more 'cause I'm sittin' on the fence right now
Though you don't deserve me
I still make excuses hoping one day you might turn it around
Oh, you ignore me when I'm callin'
Even though you know it's gonna hurt my feelings
But that just don't hurt me enough for me to leave you
Gave me just enough to stick around

(Hey) Should I stay? Should I go?
(Hey) Saying yes, feeling no
(Hey) I just can't make up my mind
(My mind)

Boy you treat me badly
But it ain't bad enough
Boy you treat me badly
But it ain't bad enough
Yeah, you've been messin' up (Messin' up)
Often, but it ain't enough to break it off (Break it off)
I know you don't mean it so I let it go
'Cause you ain't bad enough

Oh I wish you could hurt me just a little more
Help me let go 'cause I don't know how
If only you could free me
You gotta make me hate you thats the only way I'll ever get out
Oh, I know you talk to other women
But I ain't got the proof, so I just keep pretendin'
That that just don't hurt me enough for me to leave you
Gave me just enough to stick around

(Hey) Should I stay? Should I go?
(Hey) Saying yes, feeling no
(Hey) I just can't make up my mind
(My mind)

Boy you treat me badly
But it ain't bad enough
Boy you treat me badly
But it ain't bad enough
Yeah, you've been messing up (Messing up)
Often, but it ain't enough to break it off (Break it off)
I know you don't mean it so I let it go (I let it go)
'Cause you ain't bad enough
