I wanna love you like your breathing soul
I wanna love you like you gotta go
I wanna touch you in a painted stall
I wanna love you like a creeper knows
Gone I wanna take you in a corner, doll
I wanna break you with a molotov
I wanna run you when the morning comes
I wanna love you like a creeper knows
Gone I wanna love you like a creeper knows
Gone
