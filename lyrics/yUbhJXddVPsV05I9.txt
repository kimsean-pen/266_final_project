Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...

It will never rain, never rain
If the great sky falls down, no rain, no more rain
Blood's pouring down, high alert, we watch it burn
It's a world under siege
Sirens, sirens, everyone's whispering
The CIA, MI6, hire the unknown
We're at the end of days
For heaven's sake

The queen's been slain
She'll never rule again
The queen's been slain
She'll never rule again
Your queen's been slain
Queen's been slain

Black parade, motorcade
Destiny sings farewell, church bells
Is anyone listening?
Everywhere bowed in prayer
Tears are falling
Coming down, coming down
I hear the heavens calling
Providence, no evidence
There's no confirmation
And only silence remains
We only know one thing

The queen's been slain
She'll never rule again
The queen's been slain
She'll never rule again
Your queen's been slain
Queen's been slain

Who will take her place?
The truth is slowly dawning
I hear tomorrow calling
Some things can't be replaced
The realization of a new generation
On the eve of imitation
All gone, overthrown

The queen's been slain
She'll never rule again
The queen's been slain
She'll never rule again
Your queen's been slain
Queen's been slain

May God bless you
May God bless you all
May God bless you all
