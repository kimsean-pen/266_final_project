With an urgent, careful stare
And some panic in those eyes
If I see you lying there
Hoping this was the last time
If you hear a distant sound
And some footsteps by your side
When the world comes crashing down
I will find you, if you hide.

And if you wish it, wish it now.
If you wish it, wish it loud.
If you want it, say it now.
If you want it, say it loud.
We all make mistakes
Here's your lifeline
If you want it, I want to
We all make mistakes
Here's your lifeline

If you want it, I want to

There's a field near the dream
I watched it grow with the widest life
I watched us all reach out and lean
For the strength that touched the sky
If you hear a distant sound
And some footsteps by your side

If you feel like coming 'round
I will take you for a ride

And if you wish it, wish it now
If you wish it, wish it loud
If you want it, say it now
If you want it, say it loud
We all make mistakes
Here's your lifeline
If you want it, I want to

We all make mistakes
Here's your lifeline
If you want it, I want to
