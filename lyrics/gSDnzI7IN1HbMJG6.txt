Miseribus Sanctus! Precatoribus Ominus
Miseribus Sanctus! Precatoribus Ominus
Miseribus Sanctus! Omine Deo Sabbaoth

When the world had a tragic fate
We were draining the poisoned sea
Though the scenes were indeed too sad
Only prayers will take the lead

Oh! Just one of us survived
At least a discent woman and a man
Wide awake! Am I alone in this place?
Someone hear me? My only hope!

The acid rain is burning
Right into your eyes
Again your dreams may lose the glow
Allow the sorrow of your thougths to meet sunrise
And shall the hopefull words
Bring love inside your heart

The acid rain is burning your eyes

Miseribus Sanctus! Pecatoribus Ominus
So the world knew a tragic fate
We were draining the deadly sea
And the scenes were indeed too sad

Only prayers have taken lead
Oh! Just Some of us survived
At least a discent woman and a man
Wide awake! Am I alone in this place?

Someone hear me? My only hope!
The acid rain is burning
Right into your eyes
Again your dreams may lose the glow
Allow the sorrow of your thougths to meet sunrise
And shall the hopefull words
Bring love inside your heart
The acid rain is burning your eyes!
