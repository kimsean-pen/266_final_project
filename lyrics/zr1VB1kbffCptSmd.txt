Desperate deranged talking in my sleep again
Eyes twitch retain a sentimental something
Looked lorn and we burned and burned
I was a cinder body soul in my dreams

Breakdown amidst the mixtures
Avoid addictive plea
Responding disillusion
Encrusted cruelty
Describe why nails enclose me
Eating so evenly
There exists a lot of reasons
To support fatality

Abstinence possessed hardly what you think it is
Hearts beat positive provided there's progress
Ignorance does insist of the right coffin
Took some food offered me can't see myself
Drank the wine wished the feverish burst of terror

Breakdown amidst the mixtures
Avoid addictive plea
Insist that nothing happened
Chilled bloodless fatigue
Recharge with bitterness
Fanatics beckoning
Mistook a look impassioned
Absorbed with clarity

Consciousness drifts away
Discarded memory
Packaged shelf life bad display

Breakdown amidst the mixtures
Avoid addictive plea
Excessive near romances
Comfort is treachery
So pound the nails in tight
Eyes screaming out of sight
Against a grain like curtain
Unbearably alive
