Oh you heard
What they say
Oh, the more things change
The more they stay the same
Ain't that a shame? (I know it's a shame)
I've been good
For some time
I'd be lying if I said that
You ain't on my mind
Been tryin' to give it some time

Feeling like I'm
Runnin' away
Never had the chance
Chance to say

I can say that loving you is easy
I don't need to prove a single thing
Somewhere along the way
I guess you got under my skin
I put all my cards out on the table
You ain't ever gonna show your hand
I would rather hold you close than
Try to understand

Mornin' sun
Mornin' high
Oh, I think this haze is for now my best disguise
No need to think about why
What'cha say
Starry-eyed
How you love to smile
And watch the clouds reside
Just tryin' to give it some time

Feeling like I'm
Runnin' away
Never had the chance
Chance to say

I can say that loving you is easy
I don't need to prove a single thing
Somewhere along the way
I guess you got under my skin
I put all my cards out on the table
You ain't ever gonna show your hand
I would rather hold you close than
Try to understand

I put all my cards out on the table
You ain't ever gonna show your hand
I would rather hold you close than
Try to understand

I can say that loving you is easy
I don't need to prove a single thing
Somewhere along the way
I guess you got under my skin
I put all my cards out on the table
You ain't ever gonna show your hand
I would rather hold you close than
Try to understand
