An unstable building that's been built on shaky ground
And what goes up must come down
So lets build it high and then reinforce
All those little things so this can run its course

I know that without windows you won't see in
And I know that with the doors closed I'm shutting everyone out

I'm concrete fake debonair
With many stories and endless stairs
But you came in, made it your own
When you're moving on, you're heading home

Keep all those sentiments at bay
Fire them off when I least expect
At that point in the day
Between stable and a wreck

It was the first time in a long time that I felt alive
At least I tried
Then my highest hopes were realized then it flat-lined
At least I tried
And I woke up scared but it's alright 'cause nothing changed
At least I tried

At least I tried
It was the first time in a long time that I felt alive
At least I tried
Then my highest hopes were realized then it flat-lined
At least I tried
And I woke up scared but it's alright 'cause nothing changed
At least I tried
At least I tried
