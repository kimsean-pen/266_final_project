I watch, and I wait in this city you call home
The man reported these streets lead to lost souls
Took a picture with my eyes
And I'm frightened of girls in plastic heights
New Manhattan
Soul to you is Paradise
Two silhouettes stranged in redlight

Anyway, we may wrong
Boulevards far from home
So, I'll find new scene
You've got the best of me
Standing in a golden frame
Looking out, but we won't change
Till I find new scene
You've got the best, got the best of me

Your eyes have a silence
Despite the commotion, we rained all the shadows
That we wished it were broken
Took my picture with my eyes,
I'm your golden
Nothing could ever disguise
New Manhattan
Soul to me, but I'll deny
I'm safe from harm, by your side

Anyway, we may wrong
Boulevards far from home
So, I'll find new scene
You've got the best of me
Standing in a golden frame
Looking out, but we won't change
Till I find new scene
You've got the best, got the best of me

Ooh ooh oh oh
Ooh ooh oh oh
Ooh ooh oh oh
Ooh ooh oh oh
