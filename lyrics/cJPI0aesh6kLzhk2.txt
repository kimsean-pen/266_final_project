My love
I will always love you
But never will I forgive you
For being gone for so long
My heart
Forever a little broken
So many nights I've woken
From a dream when you came back to me

So won't you please, please
Please, please, please
Please, please, please, please
Release me

I've done my best
At doing the best that I can
I've spent my life in the shadow of a man
Now I wanna be the writer of this song
And a love, not just a longing
In a world that is just calling me
To be free

Only I know
What we had between us
Some people don't believe us
The things that have been spoken
Don't leave anyone heartbroken
But nevermind
I'm still a survivor
But I'm begging to belight her
It's all on me to set this free

So won't you please, please
Please, please, please
Please, please, please, please
Release me

I've done my best
At doing the best that I can
I've spent my life in the shadow of a man
Now I wanna be the writer of this song
And a love, not just a longing
In a world that is just calling me
To be free

I've lived, I've lived, I've lived
For more than two of your lives
I've lived to move these mountains aside
I've lived just by staying alive

So won't you please, please
Please, please, please
Please, please, please, please
Release me
Release me
