I ain't sleeping
Too much in my head
I've been thinking
Somethin's left unsaid
And in the morning
Feeling just the same
Boy, it's killing me

I ain't cryin'
Don't wanna be alone
Just need liftin'
From my melancholy tone

Make no mistake, a little too late
Is just too long
Don't ask me why, this is goodbye
If you do me wrong

So baby tonight, I might, let you in
No need to fight, I'm yours, so let's begin
But baby I know, when you go, your touch I'll miss
But starting tonight, if you don't treat me right
Then it's just gonna end as a goodnight kiss

Boy you're dreamin'
You don't know what to do
Don't be shy
Stop, I'm coming through
And in the meantime
If you have a little doubt

Make no mistake, it's never too late
What's done can be undone
Don't be fraid, to do what I say
The best is yet to come

So baby tonight, I might, let you in
No need to fight, I'm yours, so let's begin
But baby I know, when you go, your touch I'll miss
But starting tonight, if you don't treat me right
Then it's just gonna end as a goodnight kiss

I'd rather be lonely than be with a phony
If I'm not the girl in your head
I'd rather be wrong if it doesn't feel right
Cos boy you're killing me tonight

So baby tonight, I might, let you in
No need to fight, I'm yours, so let's begin
But baby I know, when you go, your touch I'll miss
But starting tonight, if you don't treat me right
Then it's just gonna end as a goodnight kiss

Baby tonight, I might, let you in
(A goodnight kiss)
No need to fight, I'm yours, so let's begin
(A goodnight kiss)
Baby I know, when you go, your touch I'll miss
(A goodnight kiss)
But starting tonight, if you don't treat me right
The it's just gonna end, as a goodnight kiss
(A goodnight kiss)
(Repeat to Fade)
