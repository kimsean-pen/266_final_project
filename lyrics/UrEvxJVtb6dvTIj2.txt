When the dust settles
And all of our battles are done
You're still here
You know me better
Than no one, you read all my scars
Like a script

Every beating I took along the ride
Was a blessing in disguise
And it hurt and I learned
When everything's been said and done
And I know that you're the only one
It was worth it, yeah so worth it

I realise that I get out of hand
I don't even ask for you to understand, hm
And sometimes whatever we do we're damned
I can't apologize for being who I am, oh oh
I've done my reconciling, I'm over compromising
I need you to see this my way

And love me as I am, oh oh
And love me as I, love me as I am
And love me as I am, oh oh
And love me as I, love me as I am

I was rough round the edges
I tried to get ahead just make sense
Of this world
I am still standing
And I've been demanding a lot
I got knocked down

Every beating I took along the ride
Was a blessing in disguise
And it hurt and I learned
When everything's been said and done
And I know that you're the only one
It was worth it, yeah so worth it

I realise that I get out of hand
I don't even ask for you to understand, hm
And sometimes whatever we do we're damned
I can't apologize for being who I am, oh oh
I've done my reconciling, I'm over compromising
I need you to see this my way

And love me as I am, oh oh
And love me as I, love me as I am
And love me as I am, oh oh
And love me as I, love me as I am (as I am)
Won't you please love me
Won't you please love me (as I am)
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me, love me, as I am
No don't you give up on me, oh oh
(I want you to love me) yeah
(I want you to love me as I am)
(Love me as I am)
(I want you to love me)
(I want you to love me)
(Love me as I am)
(I want you to love me as I am)
