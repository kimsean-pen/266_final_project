Whoo!

Let you take me out.
I know what you are all about,
But when I did, I wasn't trying to lead you on.

I wasn't trying to lead you on.
I want a friend.

I know you expecting a one-night stand.
When I refused, I knew you wouldn't understand.
I told you twice, I was only trying to be nice.
Only trying to be nice. Oh.
