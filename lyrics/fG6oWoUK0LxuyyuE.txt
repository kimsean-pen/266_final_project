When this train rolls down the track
I'm not coming back
Gotta one way ticket, I'm going home
Back where I started from

Oh, take me down south
When you take me home, Lord
When you take me home, Lord

The last time I saw you
I meant to say I love you
I've been right and I've been wrong
But I always miss you when I'm gone

Oh, take me down south
Take me down south
Talk when you take [?]
When you take me home, Lord

Oh, take me down south
Take me down south
Take me down south
Take me down south
Lord, when you take me home, yeah
When you take me home, yeah

Wanna be next to my baby, yeah
