My bad what am I fighting for
So good cause I still see the door
And I'm out when you don't have more
Let's go

You're mad I think I entertain
All that food
I left my tongue in the rain
It's so wrong
But nothing's safe
Let's go
Dull

Go high
Something to look out for?? been in every hole
I could die
But that's been done before
I'm like
Let's go
Dull

I survive
All my intention's bad
You can't score with me
'Cause I'm a polar??
You wanna be my friend
Entertain entertain entertain
