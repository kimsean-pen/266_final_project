The fire rages in me
Never want to see the roses on your door
The glass that separates our touch
Soaring into the unknown skies fearing what we're fighting for

This is a war we cannot win!

Our last time to make stars collide right before our eyes
Believe in everything, everything you've ever known
Reciting words we lost, these years will never be untold
I won't be alone

The fire rages in me
Daylight fights through the night with the cries of redemption
The sun ignites the light in our eyes

And this is possible?

Our last time to make stars collide right before our eyes
Believe in everything, everything you've ever known
Reciting words we lost, these years will never be untold
I won't be alone

This time we fight
Side by side you and I

This time we fight
Side by side you and I
The bringers of light
The teeth in the night
The teeth in the night
The bringers of light
The teeth in the night
I won't be alone
