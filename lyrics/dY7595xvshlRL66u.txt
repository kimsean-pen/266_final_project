Time is like a bullet from behind
I run for cover just like you
Time is like a liquid in my hands
I swim for dry land just like you

Time is like a blanket on my face
I try to be here just like you
Time is just a fiction of our minds
I will survive and so will you

We are the only ones right now that are celebrating
And we are joining hands right now
We are the only ones right now that are suffocating
We are the dying ones right now

As the water grinds the stone
We rise and fall
As our ashes turn to dust
We shine like stars

As the water grinds the stone
We rise and fall
As our ashes turn to dust
We shine like stars

Kisses on the dancefloor in my past
I need some comfort just like you
Beating like a bass drum time goes by
I want the last dance just like you

Drowning in the flood of morning light
I'm only human just like you
Do you hear the city waking up
I will survive and so will you

We are the ones the only ones
We are the ones the dying ones
We are the ones the only ones
We are the ones and we are joining hands

We are the only ones right now that are celebrating...

As the water grinds the stone
We rise and fall
As our ashes turn to dust
We shine like stars

As the water grinds the stone
We rise and fall
As our ashes turn to dust
We shine like stars

As the water grinds the stone
We rise and fall
As our ashes turn to dust
We shine like stars
