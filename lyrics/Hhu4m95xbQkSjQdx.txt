Your hair reminds me of a time when were we once were
Your fingernails that marked my back now rot in earth
The sheets we slept in blew away, and now the storm is over
The taste of you inside my mouth remains, but still I'm hearing

There's no love, everybody's crying
There's no truth, everyone's misguided
And now the end is here
There's no more pills to swallow
The bitter taste I feel won't lead me to tomorrow

Your scent reminds me of a place we used to go
The kisses placed upon my neck show signs of no return
The bed we fucked in smells the same, and now the stench is fading
The taste of you inside my mouth remains but still I'm hearing

There's no love, everybody's crying
There's no truth, everyone's misguided
And now the end is here
There's no more pills to swallow
The bitter taste I feel won't lead me to tomorrow

Cries for anger, lies for power
Fighting for nothing is what you were born for
Cries for anger, lies for power
Fighting for nothing is what you were born for

Cries for anger, lies for power
Fighting for nothing is what you were born for
Cries for anger, lies for power
Fighting for nothing is what you were born for
