Hard to clench my fist well with all the things I should tell
Tension and an ill will towards you and I
It's not the same as you feel it used to be a light teal
But that shade was never real for you and I

Can't ignore, won't ignore
That I just don't know you anymore
Can't ignore, won't ignore
That which you played me for

You know how hard that I fell
Hazy every detail about who cared the most
When it comes to you and I
I never thought that you'd bail
I guess I let it go stale
My blood is always hot when it comes to you and I

You want him like you wanted me
But I know that it's not the same thing
Covet what you cannot bring
I won't calm down I'll never let it be
