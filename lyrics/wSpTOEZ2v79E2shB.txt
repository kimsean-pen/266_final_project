Got an attitude
Thinking that he's always right
Blowing smoke rings
Making me wanna fight

And then I look back
At all the things I've ever done
And then I look up
Seeing that he's on the run
Seeing that he's on the run

It's a big thing
Everything her heart desires
And now I have to
Try to out-do the fight

I caught a big break
When I played in the road
I saw you laughing
Even though you know it's so
Even though you know it's so
Even though you know it's so

Even when you're on the run
Even when you're on the run
Even when you're on the run
Even when you're on the run
Even though you know it's so
