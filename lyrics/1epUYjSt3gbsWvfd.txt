Riding around town with no lights on
Bumpin' DarkThrone out my Audi A4
Pentagram on my shawty torso
Nails on my neck bout blood soaked
I ain't got no heart it's still in Moscow
You must not be flame if you got smoke
Blood so cold, where my trench coat?

Wait until they see what's in my
Wait until they see what's in my trench coat
Wait until they see what's in my trench coat
Wait until they see what's in my trench coat
Wait until they see what's in my

Ever since i was a fetus I knew that I could be this
reincarnated elated Crowley I'm
misunderstood and I'm proud about it now
I'm rounding up all the calloused and malice and puttin' em
all up in a palace call it the White House no power balance
Let me get another shot at living
and I'll never take it for granted again
I swear to what?
None
Hallway greeted with a gun
How has it come to this everybody run
Police will put you in a wooden box in the ground
if you look at em wrong in the wrong part of town
But a mothafucka with a gun at a campus
blastin' away at the staff and masses you'll let
Live on again
With no regrets
Oh bet
Who the fuck let you paint the land all red
It's all a mess
I'm just a guest
Go blast
Your local press
Kill em all Kill em all

Wait until they see what's in my trench coat
Wait until they see what's in my trench coat
Wait until they see what's in my trench coat
Wait until they see what's in my trench coat
Wait until they see what's in my trench coat
Wait until they see what's in my trench coat
Wait until they see what's in my trench coat
Wait until they see what's in my
