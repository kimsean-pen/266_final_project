White riot I wanna riot
White riot a riot of my own
White riot I wanna riot
White riot a riot of my own

Black man gotta lot a problems
But they don't mind throwing a brick
White people go to school
Where they teach you how to be thick

An' everybody's doing
Just what they're told to
An' nobody wants
To go to jail

White riot I wanna riot
White riot a riot of my own
White riot I wanna riot
White riot a riot of my own

All the power's in the hands
Of people rich enough to buy it
While we walk the street
Too chicken to even try it

Everybody's doing
Just what they're told to
Nobody wants
To go to jail

White riot I wanna riot
White riot a riot of my own
White riot I wanna riot
White riot a riot of my own

Are you takin' over
Or are you takin' orders?
Are you goin' backwards
Or are you goin' forwards?

White riot I wanna riot
White riot a riot of my own
White riot I wanna riot
White riot a riot of my own
