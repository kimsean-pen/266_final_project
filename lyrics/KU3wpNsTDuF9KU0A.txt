She wants to know, wants to know where I've been
She's got the gloves on, she's got the gloves on again
She's thinks she's smooth, thinks she's smooth and now I'm saying
That I'm not going down, I'm not going down
You say this ain't the end of me
Fall down, pull the rug under me
Feels like I'm falling, but I tell you I'm not going down
One day you'll be the end of me
Go blind, pull the wool over me
Feels like I'm falling, but I tell you I'm not going down
Because you push me, push me over the edge
Tired of wasting my time, tired of wasting my breath
Because you push me, push me over the edge
Tired of wasting my time, tired of putting me through this again
(Through this again)
She wants to fight, wants to fight and I've been drinking
We put the walls up, we put the walls up again
I know she's right, know she's right, God I'm drifting
But I'm not going down, I'm not going down
You say this ain't the end of me
Fall down, pull the rug under me
Feels like I'm falling, but I tell you I'm not going down
One day you'll be the end of me
Go blind, pull the wool over me
Feels like I'm falling, but I tell you I'm not going down
Because you push me, push me over the edge
Tired of wasting my time, tired of wasting my breath
Because you push me, push me over the edge
Tired of wasting my time, tired of putting me through this again
Because you, never did try,
never did look to see that I'm alright (whoa)
Because you, always right, gotta fight, always wanna know (whoa)
Because you, never did try,
never did look to see that I'm alright (whoa)
Because you!
Because you push me, push me over the edge
Tired of wasting my time, tired of wasting my breath
Because you push me, push me over the edge
Tired of wasting my time, tired of wasting my breath
(Because you push me)
You push me, you push me
(Because you push me)
You push me over the edge
You push me, you push me
You push me
Why do you do it? You've put me through this again
Through this again
Through this again
