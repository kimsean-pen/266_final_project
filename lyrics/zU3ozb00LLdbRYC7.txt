'Sup girl?
Ooh-ooh-ooh

She's a weekend beauty queen
At the blacklight clubs wearing out the scene
You know her type
Out all night

Starry eyed for the dirty dream
Always looking for a prince where the cash is king
On the boulevard
In a big black car
She's everywhere you are

I smell her sweet perfume
Making rounds around the room
'Cause she's a downtown girl
A downtown girl
Her lips are red
And those hips are turning heads
'Cause she's a downtown girl, a downtown girl
A downtown, downtown, girl, girl
A downtown, downtown, girl, girl

Living like a celebrity
All the guys line up and the drinks are free
She knows she's hot
But that's all she's got
Everybody knows she's on the move
With her six inch heels and an attitude
To seal the deal
She shoots to kill
But I'm not going down

I smell her sweet perfume
Making rounds around the room
'Cause she's a downtown girl
A downtown girl
Her lips are red
And those hips are turning heads
'Cause she's a downtown girl, a downtown girl
A downtown, downtown, girl, girl
A downtown, downtown, girl, girl

Likes the attention, and gets the attention
Her name is on the bathroom wall (her name is on the bathroom wall)
The party's never over
She's always coming over
Even when the music stops

I smell her sweet perfume
Making rounds around the room
'Cause she's a downtown girl
A downtown girl
Her lips are red
And those hips are turning heads
'Cause she's a downtown girl, a downtown girl

And all the boys staring at the girls staring
At the boys staring at the downtown girl, downtown girl
Her lips are red
And those hips are turning heads
'Cause she's a downtown girl, a downtown girl
A downtown, downtown, girl, girl
A downtown, downtown, girl, girl
A downtown, downtown, girl, girl
A downtown, downtown, girl, girl
A downtown, downtown, girl, girl
A downtown, downtown, girl, girl (ooh-ooh-ooh)
