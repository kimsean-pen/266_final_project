I finally know why I can't get an answer
I finally know why I feel like a number
They keep a secret into their minds
They never talk even for telling lies

Make me feel (hey) at least like a monster
Make me feel (hey) at least like fire
It seems I can't find a place to go
There's a wall of things I'll never know
Why would I escape?

'Cause everywhere I go, ho
There's nowhere I belong, ho
Can anyone just tell me where will I find?
'Cause everywhere I go, ho
I'm always on my own, ho
Can anyone just catch me before I drown?
Can anybody make me feel like I'm not a stranger tonight?

I finally know why I can't look further
I finally know why they don't speak louder
There is a secret that won't be mine
They'll never talk until the end of time

Make me feel (hey) at least like a monster
Make me feel (hey) at least like fire
It seems I can't find a place to go
There is a wall of things I'll never know
Why would I escape?

'Cause everywhere I go, ho
There's nowhere I belong, ho
Can anyone just tell me where will I find?
'Cause everywhere I go, ho
I'm always on my own, ho
Can anyone just catch me before I drown?
Can anybody make me feel like I'm not a stranger tonight?

(Hey, hey) What should I run away?
(Hey, hey) I always felt this way
(Hey, hey) I cannot run away
(Hey, hey) I'm not a stranger tonight

Hey, hey hey hey
Hey, hey, hey

Why would I escape?

Everywhere I go, ho
There's nowhere I belong, ho
Can anyone just tell me where will I find?
'Cause everywhere I go, ho
I'm always on my own, ho
Can anyone just catch me before I drown?
Can anybody make me feel like I'm not a stranger tonight?

Hey
