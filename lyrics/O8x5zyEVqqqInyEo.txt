Three times the eclipse
Before she lays her soul to rest
Channelling the darkness of many nights
All this was once her dream

See and feel
The blackened blade of revenge

Cold white towering mountains
The passage to the land of phantoms
Deep forlorn woods
Where the gleam of neither light or -
Bliss reach

The castle lies in the mist
Between the mountain and marshes
Throughout the last centuries
Have the moonshine enlightened her coffin

Black soul of the hunter

The hungering thirst
The enchantress of the night
The hungering thirst
Evil, devour its soul
Since the medieval times
Have your shadow haunted:
