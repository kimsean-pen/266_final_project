I've walked through the valleys of the wilderness in time,
Only to find out
That you have love in places I can't describe, yeah
I need you
It's the sunrise

I just wanted to let you know,
I love you
Don't ever let go
'Cause the sun don't shine when your love's round mines
And I'll never
Be without you

Dancin' to the sun
Dancin' to the sun
Dancin' to the sun
Dancin' to the sun
Dancin' to the sun
Dancin' to the sun
Dancin' to the sun
Dancin' to the sun
Dancin' to the sun
Dancin' to the sun
Dancin' to the sun
Dancin' to the sun

Singing the sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
The sun don't shine without you,
Without you

The world is bass and time, your love is mine
But the sun don't shine without you,
Without you, yeah

When I saw you rise the other day,
I felt our worries just seem to melt away
Into you, yeah
Into you, oh yeah

I just wanted to let you know
I love you
Don't ever let go
'Cause the sun don't shine when your love's round mines
And I can never,
Be without you oh

Dancin' to the sun
Dancin' to the sun
Dancin' to the sun
Dancin' to the sun

Singing the sun don't shine,
The sun don't shine
The sun don't shine
The sun don't shine without you,
Without you

The world is bass and time, your love is mine
But the sun don't shine
The sun don't shine without you,
Without you, yeah

Dancin' to the sun
Dancin' to the sun
Dancin' to the sun
Dancin' to the sun
Dancin' to the sun
Dancin' to the sun
Dancin' to the sun

No no no
