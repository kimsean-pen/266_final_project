Mmhmm
I ain't trying to think about all my problems
I'm living now
I'm living now
Hey
I can't sit and worry about the future
I'm living now
Said I'm living now

So put your hands up, if you feel like having a good time
Put your hands up, if you got no cares at all
Raise your cups, if you got no work tomorrow
Put your hands up, if you're ready to have some fun

Come on, sing it
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, it feels so good to be alive
Don't it feel good, come on
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Said oh it feels so good to be alive

Come on, from now on
I'm gonna wake up every day like it's Christmas
I'm gonna celebrate this life I'm given
From now on

From now on
Gonna tell my mother every day I love her
And tell her "thanks for being such a good mother"
From now on, come on

So put your hands up, if you feel like having a good time
Put your hands up, if you got no cares at all
Raise your cups, if you got no work tomorrow
Put your hands up, if you're ready to have some fun

Come on
Come on sing it
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, it feels so good to be alive
Sing it
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Said oh it feels so good to be alive
Yes it does, hey!

It feels good, don't it?
Living your life in this quick moment
And you never ever think it's gonna go away, but I swear
I know you'll wake up one day and say
Yeah, I got things to do (you'll say)
Yeah, I got mountains to move
And it ain't about how sad it could be
It's about how good it should be
Come on, sing

Feels good, don't it? Feels good, don't it?
You only got one life, live in the moment
Feels good, don't it? Feels good, don't it?
You only got one life, live in the moment
Feels good, don't it? Feels good, don't it?
You only got one life, live in the moment
Feels good, don't it? Feels good, don't it?
You only got one life, come on sing it

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, it feels so good to be alive
Don't it feel good, come on
(Oh it feels) oh oh oh, (so good) oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, it feels so good to be alive

Don't it feel good
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh (always), it feels so good (so good) to be alive (so good)
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, it feels so good (feels so good) to be alive
Come on sing it
Feels good, don't it? Feels good, don't it?
You only got one life, live in the moment
Feels good, don't it? Feels good, don't it?
You only got one life, live in the moment
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh, it feels so good to be alive
