galloping over quicksand
racing through the naked dunes
jaded by the dust and the sun
you'll get high on solitude

space camel where is your pack?
you know they're looking for you
man, have you lost your track?
you ran and you never looked back

nowhere to settle your mind
memories you left behind
daydreams are fading away
let them become yesterday

space camel where are you now?
wondering why and how
my friend you shall remain
never to come back again
