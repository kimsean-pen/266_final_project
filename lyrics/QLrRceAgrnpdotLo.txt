They held their heads with laughs of pain
They'd learned from men who'd just refrain
From glancing at a mirror's face

Seven screaming diz-busters
Who lurk behind the rose
Cast iron for a bloodstream
And ice behind their eyes

On each and all those holy nights
When duster's dust becomes the sale
And Lucifer the light, the light

They're long so long this time of year
When stars be crossed by twirling fear
You don't suppose I'd prove surprised

Well seven screaming diz-busters
Should go the route and die
Without that warmth they've learned to crave
With hardened smiles and evil signs (ah, well)

Bury me near the secret cove
So they'll not know the way
Bury me round behind the rose
So they'll not rile my grave
I'll not reveal whose name's still lost

Well their laughs of pain, Ah, ha, ha, ha!

And their harder smiles...
And their rigid arms...
And their evil signs...

The longer days and the longer nights
Yeah they're longer...
They're longer still

On each and all those holy nights
When duster's dust becomes the sale
And Lucifer the light

Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light Oh, the light
Lucifer the light I can't stand the light
Lucifer the light I can't stand it now
Lucifer the light No
Lucifer the light Can't stand the light
Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light Can't stand the light
Lucifer the light Can't stand the light
Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light Can't stand the light
Lucifer the light Oh no!
Lucifer the light Aahhh
Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light I can't I can't
Lucifer the light No
Lucifer the light Can't stand it
Lucifer the light Can't stand it, no
Lucifer the light Can't stand it
Lucifer the light Can't
Lucifer the light Can't I can't I can't can't can't can't stand it
Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light Just can't stand the light
Lucifer the light one
Lucifer the light two
Lucifer the light three
Lucifer the light four
Lucifer the light five
Lucifer the light six
Lucifer the light And seven
