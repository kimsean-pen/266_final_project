Before electric light
You paddled through the soup of darkness as a crocodile
Cherry picking in the river
I would leave crisp note footprints at the Bankside

Watch it closely you see it begin to move
Watch it closely you see it begin to flicker

While we're here, let's see what happens
What we got, got, got to lose
While we're tidal and flexed on a full moon
It'd be a sure, sure shame to not to

In every wonder what you are
I've blurted everything I know just for a piece of it
Flash frozen, patchworked and fallow
I sprung up in hearts and arrow superhighways

Watch it closely you see it begin to move
Watch it closely you see it begin to flicker

While we're here, let's see what happens
What we got, got, got to lose
While we're tidal and flexed on a full moon
It'd be a sure, sure shame to not to

Do what you feel, just how you like
Nobody has to know

Watch, watch... watch... watch, watch...

What we got to lose

While we're here, let's see what happens
What we got, got, got to lose
While we're tidal and flexed on a full moon
It'd be a sure, sure shame to not to

Do it for England
Do it for love
Do it for us
Do it for goodness sake
Do it for all the times
We wished we had

Do what you want, just how you like
Nobody has to know
Do what you want, just how you like
Nobody has to know
