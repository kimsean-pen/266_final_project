I can swim, I can't swim, I can swim, I can't swim
I can swim, I can't swim, I can swim, I can't swim
Well here's a notion, a single idea
Swing by the ocean, because
I can't swim, I can swim, I can't swim, I can swim
I can't swim, I can swim, I can swim, I can swim
Hang by a maritime, marine at nighttime, waiting waterlogged down by the high sea
Waiting (wading) waterlogged, for that guy to arrive
Oh he don't know that
I can swim, I can't swim, I can't swim, I can swim
If there was even one chance, that he would come along
If there was even one chance, that he would come alone
If there was even one chance, that he would come along
If there was even one chance, and take a drink by the drink
F**ked up in the flood, stoned
And get soused by the sea
And take a dip, in the briny deep
Hang by the maritime, marine at nighttime
Waiting waterlogged, down by the high sea
Wading waterlogged, for that guy to arrive
Well he don't know that
I can swim, I can't swim, I can't swim, I can swim
I can't swim, I can swim, I can't swim, I can swim
