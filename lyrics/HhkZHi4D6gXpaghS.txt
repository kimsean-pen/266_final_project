When just a light remains
There in dark returns like echo waves
I hope I'm not too late
For this final twist of fate

Once grief has passed me by
The pantomime of time comes healing
Feel mockery caress in me
Now that yesterday is burning free

Goodbye, I know my love will go on
And wait until the tears are gone
Goodbye, I know this love will go on
Until the silence says goodbye

I saw our memories die
For our dreams had lost their meaning
But dreams, still in my heart
Are painting colours in the dark

Goodbye, I know my love will go on
And wait until the tears are gone
Goodbye, I know this love will go on
Until the silence says goodbye

Goodbye, I know my love will go on
And wait until the tears are gone
Goodbye, I know that this love will go on
Until the silence says goodbye

Goodbye, I know our love will go on
Till silence says goodbye
