Before she met me she took herself to wait five years
After I met her, her teacher said "Best wait five years."
I ask my neighbors, they said it's wise to wait five years.

I say "Fever."

I told a friend how I'm feeling and this made her sad
'Cause she fears that no man will ever desire her so bad.
How dare I feel this and do naught but sit on my hands.

I say "Fever."

Hold my heart like a hot potato,
push the clock for an hour later.
This is just code to decipher;
found my ploughman, chased the piper.

That ended up.
That's all now.
These are the ones who talk.
Never a lick--needs her to kiss him.

The first five years go by and we are no longer here.
I blame myself for not taking steps to draw her near.
I try to decide what to do now based on love not fear.

I say "Fever."

(Fo[u]r years.)

Hold my heart like a hot potato,
push the clock for an hour later.
This is just code to decipher;
found my ploughman, chased the piper.
