No more sad songs
No pain, no separation
Strung out on memories, rest beneath the leaves
"Someday" never came so I keep waiting
I will go to sleep still believing

No more sad song
Nothing anticipated
Days come and go without saying goodbye
"Someday" never came so I keep waiting
I will go to sleep still believing

No more sad songs
I owe the world nothing
I've been strung alone too long to really care
"Someday" never came so I keep waiting
I will go to sleep still believing

No more sad songs
I will serve no purpose
I love everyone that I have ever known
"Someday" never came so I keep waiting
I will go to sleep still believing
