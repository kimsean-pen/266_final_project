Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same
Will it make it easier on you now
You got someone to blame

You say
One love
One life (one life)
When it's one need
In the night
It's one love (one love)
We get to share it (oh)
It leaves you darling
If you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well it's too late
Tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one but we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other
One, one, one (one), one (one)

Have you come here for forgiveness
Have you come to raise the dead
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head
Did I ask too much
More than a lot
You gave me nothing
Now it's all I got
We're one but we're not the same
We hurt each other
Then we do it again

You say
Love is a temple
Love a higher law
Love is a temple
Love is the higher law
You ask of me to enter
But then you made me crawl
And I can't be holding on
To what you got
When all you got is hurt

One love
One blood
One life
You got to do what you should

One life
With each other
Sisters
And my brothers

One life
But we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other

One (one), one (one), one, one (one)
One love, one life
