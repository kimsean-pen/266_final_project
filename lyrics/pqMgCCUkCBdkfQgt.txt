I can love you with my eyes closed
I don't lose sight of your beauty
'Cos your heart is fine gold baby
Imma take my time with your mind

Your ambition won't leave me alone
Tell me 'bout your dreams, tell me everything
Don't nobody care about your heart like I do
Girl I'm down for you just the way that you're down for me
Body like a queen
But it ain't about your body baby it's about your being
I ain't rolling up, but I'm on a high
When you really think about it, ain't no wonder why

I'm so down for you

You're so beautiful, girl a blind man could love you

Beauty in your soul, girl a blind man could love you
(woo! yeah. woo! yeah)

A blind man could love you just for who you are
Got 20/20 vision and i still don't see ya flaws
I said you make me feel good, and you ain't even touch me

And now I'm doin' the most

Making sure I keep your attention baby

With my eyes open, there's no one badder, there isn't
Never left and I'm glad that you didn't

Body like a queen
