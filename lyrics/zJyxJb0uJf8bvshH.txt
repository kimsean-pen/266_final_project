Desolate loving in your eyes
You used to make my life so sweet
Step out like a god found child
I saw your eyes across the street

Ooh, I've been a fool to take you to be
More than just kind
To stare into a life of maybe
Love is hard to find

In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind

Watch me clinging to the beat
I had to fight to make it mine
That religion you could sink in neat
Just move your feet an' you'll feel fine

Ooh, we've been a fool to maybe
Trade a kiss in time
But who am I to say that's crazy
Love will make you blind

In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind

Desolate loving in your eyes
You used to make my life so sweet
Step out like a god found child
I saw your eyes across the street

Ooh, I've been a fool to take you to be
More than just kind
To stare into a life of maybe
Love is hard to find

In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
