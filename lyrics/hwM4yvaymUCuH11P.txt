I was on the grind I could hardly find
Time to be with you
You were always there but I never cared
Until you went away
Thinking back to then
What I should have done
To show you my love
I can't believe I let you
I can't believe I let you slip away

Are you gonna be ok?
I've been doing so much thinking about you
Fall asleep and I start dreaming about you
Are you gonna be ok?
I've been doing so much thinking about you
Fall asleep and I start dreaming

You were always mine then there came a time
You needed to be free
I didn't understand it wasn't in the plans
But I let you be
They say that if they love you and you let them go
They'll fly back one day
I can't believe I let you
I can't believe I let you slip away

Are you gonna be ok?
I've been doing so much thinking about you
Fall asleep and I start dreaming about you
Are you gonna be ok?
I've been doing so much thinking about you
Fall asleep and I start dreaming

You always were so carefree in your way
You never let it get to you that way
And now you are so far
You're so far away
I hope you know what to do
I'll be thinking about you
Thinking about you

Are you gonna be ok?
I've been doing so much thinking about you
Fall asleep and I start dreaming about you
Are you gonna be ok?
I've been doing so much thinking about you
Fall asleep and I start dreaming
