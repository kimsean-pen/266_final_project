Never happy, not satisfied
Always complains for nothing
Hopes and dreams are fading away
It's not hard to figure it out
There's no doubt, you'll find a way
Live the moment, each and everyday
I don't know why
I cannot see the beauty in front of me
I cannot...
I don't know why
I cannot see the beauty in front of me (in front of me)
Now I see here
It's always been there
People like their simple things
Live the moment, each and every day
I don't know why
I cannot see the beauty in front of me
I cannot...
I don't know why
I cannot see the beauty in front of me (in front of me)
Is it there?
Is it right there?
Right in front of you (right in front of you)
This is what you've been looking for
For a long, long time
Make it real, make it right now (make it right now, make it right now)
You've got to live it now
I don't know why
I cannot see the beauty in front of me
I cannot...
I don't know why
I cannot see the beauty in front of me (in front of me)
