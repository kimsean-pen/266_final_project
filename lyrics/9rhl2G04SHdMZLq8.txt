It has always been there
As far back as I am able to see
In the childhood memories
Like an old towery tree
Amongst the most vast darkest forest
Shrouding the baleful skies
Yet hailing both the Moon and the Sun
When the old man is long forgotten and gone

No matter the place or time
It never faded, never disappeared
From house to house, age to age
Followed every single step
Yet evaded the curious hunting eyes

Travelled over quarter a century
Accompanied through all the ashen paths
All of them joys
All of them sorrows
Leaving behind no victory or defeat
Still its face stays hidden
No names have been heard
And I guess we never truly met

Floating in every shadow
Be it the dawn of a new day
Or the heart of the deceased light
It still remains like a silent mountain
