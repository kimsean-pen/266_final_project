Darling, we're starting, she said
We go alive in a heartbeat
Waiting for something in my car
A little hope out of nothing
Through the hum on the line
She said I was a first time caller
But a long time listener
I've been waiting a while to talk to you
She said I was a first time caller
But a long time listener
I've been waiting a while to talk to you
Falling like trash from the sky
I hit a patchwork of loneliness, crooked and wild
Hung from the stars and dropped through the night
To a heatwave in hard place-lessness, neon tiles
And I got nothing but time
She said I was a first time caller
But a long time listener
I've been waiting a while to talk to you
She said I was a first time caller
But a long time listener
I've been waiting a while to talk to you
I want you to love me
More than I love you
Tell me if that's something you can do
I want you to love me
More than I love you
Tell me if that's something you can do
First time caller, long time listener
First time caller, long time listener
First time caller, long time listener
First time caller, long time listener
