Tell me why?
We won't fight.
Are we wrong?
You worked hard for the wounds.

So! Were we owed an ira to be whole?
We were robbed of the right.

Come as you were
You're alright... Come as you were

Money, honey, bloody mary, money, honey
Might as well marry the Ghost.
Money, honey, bloody mary, money, honey
Bloody well marry the the girl...

Know, you weren't wrong,
But as the moments will evolve, know this:

We come as we were,
We were called.
Come as you were...

Money, honey, bloody mary, money, honey
Might as well marry the Ghost.
