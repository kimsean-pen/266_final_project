Oh, Oh, Oh

If I should die before I wake
It's 'cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like
Living in a world with no air
Oh

I'm here alone, don't wanna leave
My heart won't move; it's incomplete
Wish there was a way
That I can make you understand

But how
Do you expect me
To live alone with just me
'Cause my world revolves me
It's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live, can't breathe with no air
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gonna be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
No air, air (no)
No air, air (no)
No air, air (no)
No air, air

I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew
Right off the ground to float to you
There's no gravity to hold me down for real

But, somehow, I'm still alive inside
You took my breath, but I survived
I don't know how, but I don't even care

So how (How)
Do you expect me (Me)
To live alone with just me (Oh)
'Cause my world revolves me
It's so hard for me to breathe

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air (Uh) (Oh)
Can't live, can't breathe with no air (Uh) (Oh)
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there (No air, air) (No air)
It's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep (so deep)
Tell me how you gonna be without me (Without me, yeah!)
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe (Breathe, no) (No air...)
No air, air (No)
No air, air (No)
No air, air (No)
No air, air (No more)

No, no, no, no air (No)
No, no, no, no air
No, no, no, no air (Baby) (No)
No air, no air

No

Yeah yeah yeah, no

No!
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air (No air yeah) (No air)
Can't live, can't breathe with no air (Woah woah) (No air)
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there (Whenever you ain't there) (No breathing)
It's no air, no air (No breathing no)
Got me out here in the water so deep (So deep) (So deep)
Tell me how you gonna be without me (Without me) (Can't breathe without you baby)
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe (Breathe â€“ no air)
It's no air, no air
No air, air (Baby, no air)
No air, air (No)
No air, air (Hard for me to breathe)
No air, air (Oh)
No air, air (No)

Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air (No air)
Can't live, can't breathe with no air (No no)
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there (Not there)
It's no air, no air
You got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gonna be without me
If you ain't here, I just can't breathe
It's no air, no air
No air, air (No)
No air, air (Oh, oh) (Oh, oh)
No air, air (No air)

No air...
