Bring your secrets to me,
Just give me your hand,
And i'll let you feel the wounds
They put in me.

If you believe in me,
How can i be dissolving?
If you'd believe me,
I'd tell you everything.

Do you fall through?
(everytime that i)
As i fall.
(everytime that i)
Do you want to,
(i'll be passing by)

Fall into me?
(fall into me)
(fall into me)
Into me.

Parents can you hear me?
Press me to your lips,
And i'll suck the poison out.
Who will heal me? me.

If you keep killing me,
How can i keep absolving?
Your sins into me,
Begin the poisoning.

Do you fall through?
(everytime that i)
As i fall.
(everytime that i)
Do you want to,
(i'll be passing by)

Fall into me?
(fall into me)
(fall into me)
Into me.

Time, time, time,
We're not, waiting.
Time, time, time
We're no one.

unknown. unknown.

Do you fall through?
(everytime that i)
As i fall.
(everytime that i)
Do you want to?
(i'll be passing by)

Fall into me
(fall into me)

Do you fall too?
(everytime that i)
As i fall.
(everytime that i)
Do you want to,
(i'll be passing by)

Fall into me
(fall into me)
(fall into me)
Into me.
