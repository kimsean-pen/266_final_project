Warrior!
Warrior!

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
I can feel the blades cutting in my skin.
But theres a will within.
I'm looking it straight in the eye
There's nothing to fear.
I am brave like a warrior.

Be Brave
There's a path?
Fear is nothing to a warrior.
Don't be scared. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger!

I am not afraid of tomorrow, no
I've got a brave heart of a warrior, of a warrior.
Even at the end of the road I go on
I've got a strong heart of a warrior, of a warrior.

Gotta choose your battles wiseley
Sit upright inside
I am brave, I'm a Warrior

Be strong, you can do whatever you set your mind to
Uncover the confidence within you
You can move mountains, you can break rocks!
