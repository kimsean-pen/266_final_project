Motion, breaking the space
The steps I retrace, the ground feels like an ocean
Writhing in pain, I try to explain
The words just come out
Broken like the limbs we used to crawl
With hopeful eyes into the sun

My equilibrium becomes delirium

Drifting in the tide in the undertow, undertow
Slowly going blind in the afterglow, afterglow
I am falling faster, vertigo, vertigo
Learning how to hold on by letting go, letting go
Vertigo
Vertigo

My spinning satellite head
Disoriented, it gravitates and spirals
To find you instead, a means to an end
A force that conquers
Broken Moons and hollow worlds
Suspended, motionless, collapse and coalesce

My equilibrium sent to oblivion

Drifting in the tide in the undertow, undertow
Slowly going blind in the afterglow, afterglow
I am falling faster, vertigo, vertigo
Learning how to hold on by letting go, letting go
Vertigo

How can you say that everything is meaningless?
When we are the product of such a random disaster

Drifting in the tide in the undertow, undertow
Slowly going blind in the afterglow, afterglow
I am falling faster, vertigo, vertigo
Learning how to hold on by letting go, letting go
Vertigo
Vertigo
Vertigo
Vertigo
