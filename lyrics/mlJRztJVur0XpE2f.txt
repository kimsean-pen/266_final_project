I embrace the darkness within
Forever serve beneath it's hand
Horrid thoughts that surface in me
Ceremony bloods command
I will live through this forever
I have done the things you grieve
As you kneel before it's evil
Death is here deep inside your

Skinned alive now naked
Terrorized, no humanity
Seek salvation from an M.I.A. God
Empty vessels chanting for your death

Walk the streets beneath the shadows
Searching for a cryptic bride
Eat alive the conscience I hate
Without pain I watch you die
I will live through this forever
I have done the things you grieve
As you kneel before it's evil
My face is the last you'll see

Soaked in blood, the mask you wear
Haunting cries, the dead scream for me
Staring eyes invoke no guilt
I can taste your mind, your lifeless

Face the dead and dying
Feel your life drain through your soul
Seek salvation from an M.I.A. God
Empty vessels chanting for the dead
Death is yours, your veins have dried

Staring eyes of glass now empty
Still you speak with lips so cold
In my head I hear you cry
God is dead can't save me
Taking lives with impunity

Resurrection of a deviant Christ
Feeding hate to capacity
Deviance
Deviance
Deviance
Deviance
