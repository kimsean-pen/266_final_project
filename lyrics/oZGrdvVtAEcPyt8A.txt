Oh, it's so traumatic
I've got these secrets I keep
Is it obvious
They've got me down on my knees
Yeah, just let me go
I keep reliving the scene
Oh, it's so traumatic
Traumatic

There's a darkness inside of this cracked in line
Locked inside this asylum I'm done
All my secrets are safe so if you so unfade
Can you read through the lines on my tongue

You're playing broken records
It's like they're on repeat
I know those words you're singing
Before you even speak
I can see right where you are
You don't need to hide in the dark

Oh, it's so traumatic
I've got these secrets I keep
Is it obvious
They've got me down on my knees
Yeah, just let me go
I keep reliving the scene
Oh, it's so traumatic
Traumatic

Put me back in my cage if I try to escape
I'm a countdown away from the truth
After all of these talks
Are you ready to stop
With this twisted traumatic reviews

You're playing broken records
It's like they're on repeat
I know those words you're singing
Before you even speak
I can see right where you are
You don't need to hide in the dark
I can see right where you are
You don't need to hide in the dark

Oh, it's so traumatic
Oh, it's so traumatic
Oh, it's so traumatic
Traumatic

Oh, it's so traumatic
I've got these secrets I keep
Is it obvious
They've got me down on my knees
Yeah, just let me go
I keep reliving the scene
Oh, it's so traumatic
Oh, it's so traumatic
