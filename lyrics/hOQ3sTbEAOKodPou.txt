Smart ass little girl always on the run
Playin' with fire and daddy's gun
Fallin' in love on stolen wine
Where did we go wrong my foolish child?

She said, I'm too young to drink
Too green to think
You say these things and it wears me out
Too young, too frail but sometimes I feel
Like old blue jeans
'Cause you wear me out, you wear me out

Well who are you to judge Miss Accidental Wife?
Who was the genius that brought me to life?
Well you're such a hypocrite to think me so unwise
I'm just tryin' to see the world
Through my own eyes

But you say, I'm too young to drink
Too green to think
You say these things and it wears me out
Too young, too frail but sometimes I feel
Like old blue jeans
'Cause you wear me out, you wear me out

Well I'm tattered and torn, see what you do?
Just admit it was all because of you
When I don't come home 'til the early morning

I'm too young to drink
Too green to think
You say these things and it wears me out
Too young, too frail but sometimes I feel
Like old blue jeans
'Cause you wear me out, you wear me out
Don't you know that you wear me out, you wear me out
