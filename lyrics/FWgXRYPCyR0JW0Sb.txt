Everyone is dressed up, everyone to the nines
Someone must have found love or someone must have died
This will be forgotten by history and scholars, alike
Another moment of import lost to time

Wild nights when we were younger, we thought we'd live forever
At least we'll die together
If killing time was a crime, we'd be on the "Most Wanted" signs
Our love will surely be forgotten by history and scholars
Forever lost in time's currents
Everybody knows that the best way to describe the ocean to a blind man is to push him in

In the company of others, I'm reminded why your lifetime lover's the temperamental kind
