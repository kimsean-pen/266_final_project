Signal
Wave across the waterfall near
Let me know
That you'll be waiting there for me
Oh, I've been troubling
Waiting for our moment of peace
These stormy waters
Got me thinking of how I wanted to be

(Be, be, wanted to, wanted to be)
(Be, wanted to be)

Signal
Lighters on and fires on me
In me, no doubt
That I'm the one who never has to leave
Oh, I've been dividing
But time and time again I keep the peace
Give me shelter
Let me be the man I've wanted to be

(Be, be, wanted to, wanted to be)
(Be, wanted to be)
(Be, be, wanted to, wanted to be)
(Be, wanted to, wanted to be)
(Be, wanted to, wanted to be)
(Be, wanted to be)
(Be, wanted to, wanted to be)
(Be, wanted to, wanted to be)
(Be, wanted to, wanted to be)
(Be)
