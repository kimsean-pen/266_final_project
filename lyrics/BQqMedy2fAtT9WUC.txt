Willy's so tall
And Avi's so fair
And Deanna's so beautiful
Pretending not to care

And I remember The Glow, oh, oh
And I remember The Glow, oh, oh

In my headphones
After school and slightly stoned
I remember The Glow

Meg's so snide
And Allie's so loud
And Micah's is so dreamy
Shaking in the crowd

And I remember The Glow, oh, oh
Yeah, I remember The Glow, oh, oh

Walking back from the show
With my heart in echo
So alone in the snow
And Phil singing just to me, only

I remember The Glow, oh, oh
I remember The Glow, oh, oh
Yeah, I remember the glow
Oh, I remember the glow

It wasn't from a phone
And I knew I wasn't alone

I remember The Glow
Yeah, I remember The Glow
I remember The Glow
I remember The Glow
