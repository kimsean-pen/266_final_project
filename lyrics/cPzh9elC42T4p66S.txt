Slow down,
Eh, what you hidin'?
Am I invited?
I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know, wanna know.
Headlights,
You wanna night drive.
I got my skin tight,
You wanna go, wanna go, wanna, go wanna go.

No one has to know,
It can just be you and me alone.
Get yourself a ticket to the show
And I let you, let you.

Hey boy, I really love the way that you move,
You wind me up, up, up on you.
You know I'm down, diggy diggy down,
Diggy diggy down,
Down, diggy diggy down,
Diggy diggy down.

Boy, I really love the way that you move,
You wind me up, up, up on you.
You know I'm down, diggy diggy down,
Diggy diggy down,
Down, diggy diggy down,
Diggy diggy down, down, down.

Closer,
I wanna know ya.
You be my soldier,
You wanna try, wanna try, wanna try, wanna try.
Lights out,
We gotta slow down.
You wanna now how,
We come alive, come alive, come alive, come alive.

No one has to know,
It can just be you and me alone.
Get yourself a ticket to the show
And I let you, let you.

Hey boy, I really love the way that you move,
You wind me up, up, up on you.
You know I'm down, diggy diggy down,
Diggy diggy down,
Down, diggy diggy down,
Diggy diggy down.

Boy, I really love the way that you move,
You wind me up, up, up on you.
You know I'm down, diggy diggy down,
Diggy diggy down,
Down, diggy diggy down,
Diggy diggy down, down, down.
