Dad says that I can't go down to the picture show
'Cause she'd open my eyes and surely I'd realize
That mom's ashamed of the way
She's blamed for that trash that she brought in
Those lashes and cotton
Oh lord

Marilyn and me
Marilyn and me
Young man you'll see
She'll make you believe

Uncle comes down from the big city town
And he takes me on out and without a doubt
I'm sitting there with my eyes locked in stare
And she's staring at me
I'll do what I please
Oh lord

Marilyn and me
Marilyn and me
Young man you'll see
She'll make you believe
