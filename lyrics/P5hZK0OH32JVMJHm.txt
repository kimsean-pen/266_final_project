When the oceans are dark
the heavens are foreboding
the chainlink wind is breaking you open
and the lessons of the day
on the blackboard of night
seem to be erased
and the beacon has no light
and the eyes of confusion
are looking far astray
from everything you needed
to keep the dogs at bay
there's no escape hatch
no submarine
that could take you to the moon
rake you in the leaves
and keep you just as safe
as you are in my hands
that someday, someday say bye bye

bye and bye and bye and bye

smaller than a stone
bigger than a road
farther than an ocean
closer than a soul
every little word
and every little step
every new direction
the closer you will get
and farther away
you'll go from where we are
and try to keep it with you
and hold it like starling
from a frozen lake
to a hollow moon
push yourself beyond
the wall they carved for you
and when you bring it down
with all their false eyes
when you've made it yours
don't forget its yours

bye and bye and bye and bye
