Can I take it
That you don't need my help
And I am finally absolved a value
I can face it, but I don't need anyone else
Nobody does it like you do

And for all the others
There'll be better days ahead
And while I recover
I'll be wishing I was dead

I've lost myself along with everyone else
And now the safest place is here in my head
But I've been left on my own to survive
But I'm wishing I was dead

Well I'd like to know what I'm doing wrong
I plan to stay back, but not for long
The time has passed and other things has changed
So I gotta grow wings or die
I don't need another reason not to die in life
Tell me if I'm doing it right this time

But let me know, what did you change
Do you feel the same?
Did it ease your pain?

I've lost myself along with everyone else
And now the safest place is here in my head
But I've been left on my own to survive
But I'm wishing I was dead

You say you hate it, but you can't really tell
The future is smiling right at you
I'm not gonna make it, so you should save yourselfs
There's no time to tell you I miss you

You lack for new a frontier
But I decided to stay back here
Inviting my time by waiting it out

Looking up to the sky this fight
These weakly wings that will never take flight
I don't even have the lungs to shout

But I need to know, what did you change
Do you feel the same?
Did it ease your pain?

I've lost myself along with everyone else
And now the safest place is here in my head
But I've been left on my own to survive
But I'm wishing I was dead

Well if life's just a game
I need to learn how to play
And if it's all the same
Please remember my name
'Cause I don't need anything, else

Well for all the others
There'll be better days ahead
And while I recover
I'll be wishing I was dead

I've lost myself along with everyone else
And now the safest place is here in my head
But I've been left on my own to survive
But I'm wishing I was dead
