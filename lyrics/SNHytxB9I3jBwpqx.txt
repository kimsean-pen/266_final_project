And through it all, we wore the pain
We held our own through the darkest of our nights
It's written in my blood, it's carved into my soul
Through the darkest of our nights
'Cause if you couldn't stop us then
What hope do you have now
When you dragged us through the fire
Did you really think that we would burn?

We're no saviours, we're no saints
We're no martyrs and we don't need saving
I've come too far to turn back
I've seen too much to play dead
If this is all you got, then take a deep breath in
As I drown you out

I'm on the edge, I'm leaning out
But I can't see the sorrow for the pain, yeah
It's written in my blood, it's carved into my soul
The sorrow and the pain
So, you think you know the story?
Did you read it in the scars?
'Cause when you threw us to the lions
Did you really think that we would run?

We're no saviours, we're no saints
We're no martyrs and we don't need saving
I've come too far to turn back
I've seen too much to play dead
If this is all you got, then take a deep breath in

Don't mistake composure for weakness
Don't mistake my silence for respect
Don't mistake composure for weakness
Don't mistake my silence for respect
I'll burn your world to the ground then spit on the ashes

Scorched fucking earth
Scorched fucking earth
As I drown you out

I've come too far to turn back
I've seen too much to play dead
If this is all you got, then take a deep breath in
