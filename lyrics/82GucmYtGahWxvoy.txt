Slow down, lie down
Remember it's just you and me
Don't sell out, bow out
Remember how this used to be

I just want you closer, is that alright?
Baby let's get closer, tonight

Grant my last request and just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders, lay down beside me
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there, lay down beside me

And I've found that I'm bound
To wander down that one way road, oh
And I realize all about your lies
But I'm no wiser than the fool that I was before

I just want you closer, is that alright?
Baby let's get closer, tonight

Grant my last request and just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders, lay down beside me
And sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there, ooh, lay down beside me, oh

Baby, baby, baby
Tell me how can, how can this be wrong?

Grant my last request and just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders, lay down beside me
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there, lay down beside me

Grant my last request and just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders, lay down beside me
And sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there, lay down beside me
Yeah, lay down beside me
