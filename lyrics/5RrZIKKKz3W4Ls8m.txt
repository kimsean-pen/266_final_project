I leapt across three or four beds into your arms
Where I had hidden myself somewhere in your charm
Our golden handshake has been smashed into this shape
It's taken magic to a primitive new place

Watch 'em run
Although it's the minimum
Heroic

We hunched together in one chair out on the deck
In snow that froze and fell down on the modern set
It looked as if I picked your name out of a hat
Next thing you know, you are asleep in someone's lap

Watch 'em run
Although it's the minimum
Heroic

We quit the room
Quit so our thoughts could rest
Rest them, I'll never move
That's when we grab ahold
Of whatever it is we fell into

Lousy with your kept time
With what the majestic cannot find
In the business of your lives
The perception, it is wrong
Mile after mile
The phantom taste drinking wine from your heels

Hey-la, hey-la, hey-la, hey-la
Hey-la, hey-la, hey-la, hey-la
Hey-la, hey-la, hey-la, hey-la
Hey-la, hey-la, hey-la,
hey-la (We have arrived too late to play the bleeding heart show)
Hey-la, hey-la, hey-la,
hey-la (We have arrived too late to play the bleeding heart show)
Hey-la, hey-la, hey-la,
hey-la (We have arrived too late to play the bleeding heart show)
Hey-la, hey-la, hey-la,
hey-la (We have arrived too late to play the bleeding heart show)
Hey-la, hey-la, hey-la, hey-la (We have arrived)
Hey-la, hey-la, hey-la, hey-la (We have arrived)
Hey-la, hey-la, hey-la, hey-la
