I'm afraid they're gonna find you
And there's nothing that I can do
A century of your priceless time
To commit a victimless crime
Vow to cares your rashes
Vow to punish with lashes
You can hide inside my locket
Put a leash on when they walk you
Next year say you didnt want to
Do they chastise you when you stray
Sallow skin and they can't look away
Start a collection of brine
Because all you do is cry
Wood ticks whisper to console you

All you do is cry
All you do is cry
All you do is cry
All you do is cry
All you do is cry
All you do is cry

I'm afraid they're gonna find you
And there's nothing that i can do
A century of your priceless time
To commit a victimless crime
Vow to cares your rashes
vow to punish with lashes
You can hide inside my locket
Put a leash on when they walk you
Next year say you didnt want to
Do they chastise you when you stray
Sallow skin and they can't look away
Start a collection of brine
Because all you do is cry
Wood ticks whisper to console you
And there's nothing that I can do
A century of your priceless time
To commit a victimless crime
A century of your priceless time
