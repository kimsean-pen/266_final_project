Oh purificator fire, that burns in me
Rekindle my courage, give me your force

Blow, northerly wind, come, wind of death
Storms, hurricanes, be at my side

By water, by air, by fire, by earth

Oh purificator water, essence of life
Mirror of time, drown the lies

Earth, mother's man
Disembowelled by your sons
From your blood of fire
Will rise the chaos

By water, by air
By fire, by earth
