I'm leaning towards a manly solution
You know this time you've gone too far
If you got the balls to meet me in the alley
When I hit, I hit hard

Yeah, hard for you, baby
Hard for you, baby
Just like your favorite movie star
Come for me, baby
Come for me, baby
If you come I'll know where you are, yeah

Do you really wanna come for me?
Do you, do you, do you, do you?
You know I got all night, ooh
Do you really wanna waste my time?
Do you, do you, do you, do you?
If you do then do it right

I'm looking for some handsome destruction
Just take me to your car
I felt the jewelry of a man
Disillusioned as I wished upon a star

Hard for you, baby
Hard for you, baby
Just like you wish you were
Come for me, baby
Come for me, baby
I'm in love with vacant hearts

Do you really wanna come for me?
Do you, do you, do you, do you?
You know I got all night
Do you really wanna waste my time?
Do you, do you, do you, do you?
If you do then do it right
Do you really wanna come for me?
Do you, do you, do you, do you?
You know I got all night, ooh
Do you really wanna waste my time?
Do you, do you, do you, do you?
If you do then do it right

Do you really wanna come for me?
You know I got all night
Do you really wanna waste my time?
If you do then do it right

Do you really wanna come for me?
Do you, do you, do you, do you?
You know I got all night, ooh
Do you really wanna waste my time?
Do you, do you, do you, do you?
If you do then do it right

Do you really wanna come for me?
Do you, do you, do you, do you?
You know I got all night
