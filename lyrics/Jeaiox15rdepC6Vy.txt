I think that we met about a week ago
You said that you liked the shape of my nose
And i told you the places that i wanna go
Someday

I can still remember how your fingers felt
Clawing at my insides 'til i melt
I don't wanna say the way it really felt

There's a sort of feeling that you make me have
Snow cones and your dad's baseball cap
I don't like the feeling that it makes me have

I could turn you inside out, you know
I could turn you inside out, oh don't you know
I could turn you inside out, you know
I could turn you inside out, but i don't know

I keep on thinking about what used to be
Rainbow high school memories
Back when both of us were only seventeen

But i don't wanna think about used to be
I don't wanna miss you in my sleep
I don't wanna think about it when i leave

I could turn you inside out, you know
I could turn you inside out, oh don't you know
I could turn you inside out, you know
I could turn you inside out, but i don't know
