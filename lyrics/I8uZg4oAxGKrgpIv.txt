I can't hear a thing
These waves crash faster
I can't see a thing
These arms grab for wonder
Enter this widing space
Inside our own small cage

I can't hear a thing
These waves crash faster
I can't see a thing
These arms grab for wonder
King Redeem - Queen Serene
Dust drifts by with one last try

Cling's trapped, glits fold inside
Blurred mind, dry his form from
High, sleep walked past my cornea
Eclipse washed out, unscaped
Search for the formal stage
I slipped past my own mind
Small gift taken from my time

New mouth! New blind!
New bone! New life!

Carve this
The spectrum, falls in for heart
Wait, race
Been starring at divinity
Home! Wrecking with those stairs
Forces are summoning
Summoning it's thunder
Fortress - deck of my empty salvation
Angry the one that awaken the shell
Is it our vow? In our rights

Scraped theft lies
From what we've done
To speak his running act without a touch
The human race has been deformed
A cruel escape is out our eyes

Kill the hero to forsake!
Whisk around him die
Colors wither, miserables
Our eyes will see no-one

Scraped theft lies
From what we've done
To speak his running act without a touch
The human race has been deformed
A cruel escape is out our eyes

Building monster to believe
The infected way
Gallards beckon, miserables
Alas mutiny no more
No more, no blind!
No more, no blind!

Can't retake grace's aura
But you've built crucifix side
You stubborn computer savior
Crawl our days, but it's in blood
You come, you should
We scratch the past!
Into the sucular
I grab the jagged gaze
Come and speak truth false
Even I'll erase

Scraped theft lies
From what we've done
To speak his running act without a touch
The human race has been deformed
A cruel escape is out our eyes
