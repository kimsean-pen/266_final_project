Let's meet at midnight, under that sign
Don't need remindin', just be on time
Breathing in, the smoky air
Clings to us but we don't care
Just love the feeling
'Cause now I got you here
Lonely nights just disappear
Starin' at the ceiling

I want an analog love
Something slow and sweet
Give me an analog love
Wanna feel the Earth underneath our feet
'Cause nothing ever seems like it will last
With every passing day moving too fast
I want an analog love

My disconnected wired-up brain
Needs to see you, needs to be here face to face
'Cause it's old-school, 'cause it's real
Do my best to make you feel hopelessly devoted

I want an analog love
Something slow and sweet
Give me an analog love
Wanna feel the Earth underneath our feet
'Cause nothing ever seems like it will last
With every passing day moving too fast
I want an analog love

Will keep on spinning 'til the world says stop
'Til the needle drops
You're the one I want
The one I want, I want

I want an analog love
Something slow and sweet
Give me an analog love
Wanna feel the Earth underneath our feet
'Cause nothing ever seems like it will last
With every passing day moving too fast
I want an analog love

Love
Love
