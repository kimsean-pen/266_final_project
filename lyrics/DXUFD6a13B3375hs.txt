They're gonna take this
Strumming along hammer it in, so I can sing my song
The devil's done this to me
I tore this place down, call out
Building the cages that broke us down
Boy get back down on your knees

So take these
Chains from me
Break these bastards
There's no masters here
In the end
Break these bastards
There's no masters here

A thousand boots down on the ground
Beating the drum under a marching sound
You better fucking believe
They're screaming left right, left right
Fists in the air you better pick a side
Against the plutocracy

So take these
Chains from me
Break these bastards
There's no masters here
In the end
Break these bastards
There's no masters here

Save the world
We never wanted, we never wanted
Save the world
We never wanted to have to save ourselves

So take these
Chains from me
Break these bastards
There's no masters here
In the end
Break these bastards
There's no masters here

No masters here
No masters there
No masters here
No masters there
