Laa, ahh, ahh
Laa, aah, aah
Laa, ahh, ahh
Laa, aah, aah

I was listening to the ocean
I saw a face in the sand
But when I picked it up
Then it vanished away from my hands
Laa

I had a dream I was seven
Climbing my way in a tree
I saw a piece of heaven
Waiting, impatient for me
Daa

And I was running far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows
Nobody knows

I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore

I was painting a picture
The picture was a painting of you and
For a moment I thought you were here
But then again, it wasn't true
Ohh...

And all this time I have been lying
Oh, lying in secret to myself
I've been putting sorrow on the
farthest place on my shelf
La-di-da

And I was running far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows
Nobody knows

I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore

But I kept running
For a soft place to fall
And I kept running
For a soft place to fall
And I kept running
For a soft place to fall
And I kept running
For a soft place to fall

And I was running far away
Would I run off the world someday?
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Home where I belong
Oh, now, now
Now take me home
Home where I belong
Ho, ho, ho
Now take me home
Home where I belong
Oh, now, now
Now take me home
Home where I belong
I can't take it anymore
