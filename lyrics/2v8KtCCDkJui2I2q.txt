The girl is back, takes a drag off her cigarette
Clothes on her back, she'll shrug you off with just one laugh

And she's so calm
And she's so calm
And her indifference could burn the whole place down

You do so many things, You do so many things
And I love you for it, but I usually forget
You do so many things, You do so many things
And I love you for it, but I usually forget

The boy is left, trying to sort through all the mess
Became so attached to feeling like a piece of trash

And he's so numb
And he's so numb
And his indifference could burn the whole place down

You do so many things, You do so many things
And I love you for it, but I usually forget
You do so many things, You do so many things
And I love you for it, but I usually forget

And even when the dogs don't bark coming in at three o'clock
Do you want me?
Or is it funny to ya?
Oh My

You do so many things, You do so many things
And I love you for it
You do so many things, You do so many things
And I love you for it, but I usually forget
