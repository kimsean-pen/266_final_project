Hit 'em with the Jab
Buddah Bless this beat

Psychedelic flow,
I'm the dope and the antidote
Fade down the street from the
Pocket store, what you know?
Goin' back and forth,
in and out, movin' lateral
Tools like mechanics,
Take your women for collateral
Put her on the saddle with
A paddle and an Adderall (Yeah)
Just tryna string it out
Llike Latimore (Alright)
Old timer ass nigga,
You are unemployed (You)
I'll buy my girl a building
With the furniture (Tell 'em)
You still gettin' their hair done,
I'm on the tummy tuck (Hah)
Yeah, I'm 2 Chainz,
I'm known to double up (Double up)
In the double R with
A double cup (Double cup)
Yeah, double parked at the W (W)
I'm from the South Side,
Go'n and throw it up (Throw it up)
Bein' around lame niggas
Give me phobia (Damn)
Every verse I do
Need a coroner (Coroner)
They say I'm heavy handed
When I'm pourin' up

'Bove sea level (Yeah),
I'm on G level (G)
Long as she naked (She),
I don't see nothin' (Alright)
The money in the way,
Fuck what they got to say
I throw it up, it's fallin' down,
It's definitely in the way (Definitely)
More than three niggas (Three),
Talkin' big flexin' (Big)
Hung the phone up
(Hung up on her),
And she still textin'
The money in the way,
Fuck what they got to say
I throw it up, it's fallin' down,
it's definitely in the way

It's definitely in the way,
The bezel get replaced (Uh)
Whatever's in the safe,
I put it in your face (Yeah)
They say life a bitch,
We goin' on a date (Tell 'em)
I came from canned goods,
I came from paper plates (I did)
God don't make mistakes,
But he'll make a way (He will)
I got a pinky ring that
Cost 'bout 80K ('Bout 80)
You was led astray,
I'm 'bout to set the pace
I think I'm booked up,
But let me check the date
(Let me check)
Watch my footsteps,
'Yeah, ankle weights (Big)
Bought a new scale,
Tryna calibrate
Tryna add it up,
I'm tryna allocate
Rockin' reptile,
Talkin' alligate'
You can clap that,
Talkin' patty cake (Bah)
School of hard knocks,
You ain't graduate
Surround the bedroom
With some yellow tape
And some chalk lines,
They gon' investigate

'Bove sea level (Yeah),
I'm on G level (G)
Long as she naked (She),
I don't see nothin' (Alright)
The money in the way, fuck
What they got to say
I throw it up, it's fallin' down,
Iit's definitely in the way
(Definitely)
More than three niggas
(Three), talkin' big flexin' (Big)
Hung the phone up
(Hung up on her), and she still textin'
The money in the way,
Fuck what they got to say
I throw it up, it's fallin' down,
It's definitely in the way
