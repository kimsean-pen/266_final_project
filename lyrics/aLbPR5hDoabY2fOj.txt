You have everything you could want and you waste it
In a marriage where you can't decide how to break it right.

Ever changing the places you hide (We will find)
An excuse in whatever you choose (Let this go)

Trickle down your face tears of pleasure
Mixed with tears of pain
They taste the same as everyone existing
I won't let you go until the end

You have everything you could need and you waste it
On a punishment that you hate so you'd break it

Ever changing the places you hide (We will find)
An excuse in whatever you choose (Let this go)

Trickle down your face tears of pleasure
Mixed with tears of pain
They taste the same as everyone existing
I won't let you go until the end

If you could try and get your timing right
I'll let you stay if you could beat the pain
Taking its place just let me disappear
If we forget I'll do it all again
There is no home there when you're not as whole
Secret is clear if you could beat the fear
There it can grow no one will ever know
If you could try and get your timing right
Leave it alone look at how much we know
I'll be okay if I can sell the pain
Look and you'll see
If I didn't make all these mistakes
Then I wouldn't be losing
Wondering but hopefully they know you wouldn't go too far
I know I let you down
Somehow in a sense let this go/not this time
