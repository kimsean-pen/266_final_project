Look at my hand
There's a soul on fire
You can lead me even higher

The main thing
The main thing
The main thing

Everybody knows
When a good thing's gone
You can really turn me on

The main thing
The main thing
The main thing

You run through here
With your words of sand
I can nearly understand

The main thing

The main thing
The main thing
The main thing
