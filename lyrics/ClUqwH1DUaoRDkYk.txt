Bet you didn't think
I could walk through fire
Come out strolling on the other side
I'm made of steel and you can't deny
Inside your head
I will never win
You let them tell them you who you are
But I'm me, I'm heading far

I'm not breakable, I'm unshakable
Why you trying to hold me down?
(Why you trying, trying to hold me down?)
I'm not breakable, so unstoppable
Nobody's gonna knock me out

No bending me
I'll never be
Like broken glass
Cause I'm not fragile like that
No one will see
Fragments of me
Like broken glass
Cause I'm not fragile like that

I packed my bags and I'm out the door
Don't let it hit you on the way out
I'm moving on don't have a doubt

I'm not breakable, I'm unshakable
Why you trying to hold me down?
(Why you trying, trying to hold me down?)
I'm not breakable, so unstoppable
Nobody's gonna knock me out
No bending me
I'll never be
Like broken glass
Cause I'm not fragile like that
No one will see
Fragments of me
Like broken glass
Cause I'm not fragile like that

No bending me
I'll never be
Like broken glass
Cause I'm not fragile like that
No one will see
Fragments of me
Like broken glass
Cause I'm not fragile like that

Mirrors can crack and hearts can collapse
Oh, I'm not fragile like that
Hard to burn out and walls can fall down
Oh, I'm not fragile like that

No bending me
I'll never be
Like broken glass
Cause I'm not fragile like that
No one will see
Fragments of me
Like broken glass
Cause I'm not fragile like that

No bending me
I'll never be
Like broken glass
Cause I'm not fragile like that
No one will see
Fragments of me
Like broken glass
Cause I'm not fragile like that

No bending me
I'll never be
Like broken glass
Cause I'm not fragile like that
No one will see
Fragments of me
Like broken glass
Cause I'm not fragile like that
