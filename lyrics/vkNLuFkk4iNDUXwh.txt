Miss Fortune is her friend
Every time she's alone
How long, Lord, how long
The river to take her home?
Miss Fortune was her friend
And a serpent indeed
How sad, Lord, how sad
To know we will never meet

Miss Fortune was her friend
Though she hurt her all time
How long, Lord, how long
will we endure the night?
The ocean so wide
The water so deep
With mountains to climb
There's no time to weep
The rope was so tight
The blade cut so deep
Miss Fortune so wise
Has brought her to sleep
Miss Fortune was her friend
Every time she's alone
How long, Lord, how long
The river to take her home?
