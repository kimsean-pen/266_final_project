Things
I couldn't say
But it's okay
You walked away

Years
Before we met
Is time a gift
Or punishment

We can't go back

Strange days slowing down
Slowing down
Slow it down

Strange days
Slowing down
You don't worry now
Worry now
Where will you be when they come?

Pain
We take more pills
Each moment moves
The last one kills
Life
A mystery
Euphoria
And misery

We can't go back

Strange days
Slowing down
Slowing down
Slow it down

Strange days
Slowing down
Slowing down
Slow it down

Strange days
Slowing down
You don't worry now
Worry now
Where will you be when they come?
