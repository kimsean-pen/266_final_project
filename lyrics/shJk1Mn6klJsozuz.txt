Never been one to listen
See me, yeah, I be flexing

Pretty bitch, on my wrist, damn, I'm shining
They wanna come out at me, I'm yelling, "Leave me alone!"
Getting rich, Gucci whip I'll be riding
Keep that check coming to me, I'm gonna ice out my bones
Pretty bitch, on my wrist, damn, I'm shining
They wanna come out at me, I'm yelling, "Leave me alone!"
Getting rich, Gucci whip I'll be riding
Keep that check coming to me, I'm gonna ice out my bones

They see me like I'm who they wanted to be
Tell 'em quit staring, but I know I'm so pretty
Like where you get that, man? I got it for free
They wanna top me up and everyday I see
Whip pulled up all black like a goth bitch
Faces on the money all blue like she emo
Man, I pulled up in my bag and I got this
People talk about what they say, 'cause we know

Never been one to listen
See me, yeah, I be flexing

Pretty bitch, on my wrist, damn, I'm shining
They wanna come out at me, I'm yelling, "Leave me alone!"
Getting rich, Gucci whip I'll be riding
Keep that check coming to me, I'm gonna ice out my bones
Pretty bitch, on my wrist, damn, I'm shining
They wanna come out at me, I'm yelling, "Leave me alone!"
Getting rich, Gucci whip I'll be riding
Keep that check coming to me, I'm gonna ice out my bones

Money stacked up, could cop an icy skeleton
Look at my skeleton, baby, getting money like a, yeah

So you know I'm gonna get it while I can
If the shit don't work, I'ma go model my hands
Really getting in too far ahead, they can't understand
Nah, they can't understand
They looking at me real weird but you know I'm the man

Pretty bitch, on my wrist, damn, I'm shining
They wanna come out at me, I'm yelling, "Leave me alone!"
Getting rich, Gucci whip I'll be riding
Keep that check coming to me, I'm gonna ice out my bones
Pretty bitch, on my wrist, damn, I'm shining
