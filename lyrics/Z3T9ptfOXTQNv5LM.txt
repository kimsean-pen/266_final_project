Here she comes again
She's feeling like she's already won
I believe it's gonna end again, all for naught
My philosophy is thing's are just as wrong as they seem
I believe it's gonna end this way, atrocity
Do you believe in love
Like I believe in pain
Nobody died for you, somebody pray for me

When you see me cut me down
And I will force it underground
There's no one left to hurt but me
And it's because of me
Right?

There he walks away
He's feeling like he's having them on
I believe he's gonna bend again
And all for naught
My philosophy is things are just as wrong as they seem
I've gotta get you off of me, it's such an oddity
Do you believe in love
Like I believe in pain
Nobody died for you, somebody pray for me

When you see me cut me down
And I will force it underground
There's no one left to hurt but me
And it's because of me
Right?

I want to see you suffer
Suffer

When you see me cut me down
And I will force it underground
There's no one left to hurt but me
And it's because of me
Right?
When you see me cut me down
And when you see me cut me down
And when you see me cut me down
And it's because of me
Suffer
