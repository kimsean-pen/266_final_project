Say hello to the night
Let order and chaos fill your eyes
Brave the fear in your mind
Walk into the afterlife

(Afterlife, afterlife, afterlife, afterlife)

The colors fly like gold in my hands
With open eyes, I'm starting again
Before you go, I think you should know
The world is your kaleidoscope

Break the sequence of hate
There's nowhere but up to go
So follow close and you'll see
The dawn of an age
Where pillars have turned to stone
And martyrs pave the way

The colors fly like gold in my hands
With open eyes, I'm starting again
Before you go, I think you should know
The world is your kaleidoscope

The colors fly like gold in my hands
With open eyes, I'm starting again
Before you go, I think you should know
The world is your kaleidoscope (kaleidoscope)

(Afterlife, afterlife, afterlife, afterlife)

Say hello to the night
Let order and chaos fill your eyes
