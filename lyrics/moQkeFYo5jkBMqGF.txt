Everything that's alive grows from a tiny seed.
You know the little tomato seeds you and Nancy planted in your garden,
and how they grew into nice, red tomatoes?
yeah
"Laughter"
look Dad

Well like this.

Daddy?

Remember how I told you the hen lays an egg?

When the baby grows up to be an old man, and dies,
they bury his body in the ground.
But his soul goes to heaven.

Now look here

Aww i'm bundled,
I got on like two jackes on,
two pair of pants,
about three socks,
a hat,
I need a mask too cause it's cold.
Real cold.
