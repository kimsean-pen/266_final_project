The day started ordinary
Boys walking by
It was the same old story
Too fresh or too shy
I'm not the kind
Too fall for a guy
Who flashes a smile
(It goes on for miles)
Don't usually swoon
But I'm over the moon
('Cause he was just too cool for school)

And now I'm
Falling for ya, falling for ya
I know I shouldn't but I
I just can't stop myself from
Falling for ya, falling for ya

Can't hold on any longer
And now I'm falling for you...
Now we're going steady
He's the cat's meow
(Meow Meow!)

He says I'm a Betty!
And we paint the town
I'm not the kind
To fall for a guy
Just 'cause he says hi
(When he's cruisin by)
He's ready to race

And I'm catching his gaze
(Down-low, on like this for days.)
And now I'm
Falling for ya, falling for ya
I know I shouldn't but I

I just can't stop myself from
Falling for ya, falling for ya
Can't hold on any longer
And now I'm falling for ya...
It feels like I tumbled from another world

Into your arms and it's so secure
Maybe I'll stumble but I'll know for sure
Head over heels
I'm gonna be your girl
And now I'm
Falling for ya, falling for ya
I know I shouldn't but I
I just can't stop myself from
Falling for ya, falling for ya
Can't hold on any longer
And now I'm falling for you...
