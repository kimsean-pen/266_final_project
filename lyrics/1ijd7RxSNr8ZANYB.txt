(girls go crazy...)
(a woman holds a man tight...)
Every day I love him just a little bit more,
a little bit more, a little bit more
Everyday I love him just a little bit more
and he loves me the same

Every day I love her just a little bit more,
a little bit more, a little bit more
Everyday I love her just a little bit more
and she loves me the same

So baby if you wanna get low
Baby if you wanna get high

It makes no sense at all
I saw red, I saw red, I saw red
One more secret lover that I shot dead

Everyday I wake up just a little bit more
Feelin' like a dog out in the yard
Is that's just how we are

Everyday I wonder if it's over
When I wake up realizin' that we hate
And break down the walls

You say it's black, I don't believe you
I say it's white, you say I'm tryin to deceive you

I'm aware of the high and the low,
I'd be waiting for you in the middle
But I just lack control

Baby if you wanna get low
Baby if you wanna get high

It makes no sense at all
I saw red, I saw red, I saw red
One more secret lover that I shot dead

Girls, don't go crazy,
Oh girls, don't go crazy,
Oh girls, don't go crazy when the men use you...
...know

Oh, woman hold your man tight
If it makes you feel right, it's your own life

WRAFFF...
