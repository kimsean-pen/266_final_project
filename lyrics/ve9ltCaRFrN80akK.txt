I'm surrounded, each doorway covered
By at least twenty men
And they're going to take me, throw me in prison
I ain't coming back again
I ain't coming back again

When I was younger, handsomer and stronger
I felt like I could do anything
But all of these people making all these faces
Didn't seem like my kith and kin
Didn't seem like my kith and kin

Colin Kincaid from the twelfth grade
I guess you could say he was my best friend
Lived in a big tall house out on Westfall
Where we would hide when the rain rolled in
Where we would hide when the rain rolled in

We went out one night and took a flashlight
Out with these two girls Colin knew from Kenwood Christian
One was named Laurie, that's what the story
Said next week in the Guardian
Said next week in the Guardian

And when I killed her it was so easy
That I wanted to kill her again
I got down on both of my knees and
She ain't coming back again
She ain't coming back again

Now, with all these cameras focused on my face
You'd think they could see it through my skin
They're looking for evil, thinking they can trace it, but
Evil don't look like anything
Evil don't look like anything

Evil don't look like anything
Evil don't look like anything
Evil don't look like anything
Evil don't look like anything

Evil don't look like anything
Evil don't look like anything
