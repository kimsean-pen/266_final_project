When I was younger, so much younger than today
Never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days have gone I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind, opened up the door

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
But I do appreciate your being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please help me, yeah?

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
Now I know I need you like I've never done before

Help if you can, I'm feeling down, down
But I do appreciate your being 'round me
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please help me, my love?

(Help)
I need somebody
(Help)
Not just anybody
(Help)
I need someone
(Help)

Won't you please help me, my love?
Help me, baby
Help me
