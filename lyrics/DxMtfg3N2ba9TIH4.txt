To the multi story car park, with our friends
Drinking from a bottle, of white lightning
On top of marks and sparks, roof running
Smoking chronic, hectic.

And it seems that nothing now will ever change
And it seems that we're on our own again

And i hope that nothing now will ever change
And i hope that we're on our own again

We'll convene at mine 3pm to play
Sega mega drive, goldenaxe and sonic, all day
"Never played it? i'll teach ya.
Can't hack it? i'll beat ya"
That's Pendell making rhymes in the corner with a litre
Of the finest Scrumpy Jack
Whilst Pdex pumps out the latest dnb track
We'll chip it to Justin's, and hit his king kong
Then we'll gather round the piano for a little sing song

First Chorus x 2
Oh if i could kidnap that feeling
The one that melts all fears from your mind
I'd make no demands no ransoms
Cos i'd never set it free (x 3)

Oh if i could kidnap that feeling
The one that melts all fears from your mind
I'd make no demands no ransoms
Cos i'd never set it free (x 3)

Oh those halcyon days and halcyon nights
Before we began to realise that things aren't right

Chorus x 2
And it seems that nothing now will ever change
And it seems that we're on our own again

And it seems that nothing now will ever change
And it seems that we're on our own again (x 4)
