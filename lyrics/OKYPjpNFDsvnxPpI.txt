The trick I tried is to stay inside this thicket
Trouble I find can't leave behind what's wicked
Let's just say you'll do, you only got two more teething
The trouble is sometimes knowing which one you're feeding
Know which one you're feeding

In this hearts of hearts, I'd open alive
I don't know what I don't know about anyway
Even though we woulda been sweet
Heart of hearts
Heart of hearts, ooh
Heart of hearts
Heart of hearts

The skin I tried to stay inside had thickened
The trouble I find I leave behind is wicked
Just to pay your due won't get you through my ceiling
The trouble is some don't know which one they're feeling
Now which one are you feeling?
Now which one are you fearing?

In my hearts of hearts, I'd open the lie
I don't know what I don't know if I let you in
If you will ever be true
Heart of hearts
Heart of hearts, ooh
Heart of hearts
Heart of hearts

In my hearts of hearts, I'd open the lie
I don't know what I don't know if I let you in
If you will ever be true
Heart of hearts
Heart of hearts, ooh
Heart of hearts
Heart of hearts
