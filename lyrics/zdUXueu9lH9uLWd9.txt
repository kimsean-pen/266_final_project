I'm a wounded man on top of trees
Gazing at the world below my feet
Fickle feelings find a way to me
Like hard winds blowing when we're lost at sea

Defeated pride
Finally got the chance to let go
Keeping it quiet
Not a worry in the world that we know
I can't decide
If I should let the words spill out at a time like this
Bright skies
But I've been known to stay in on days such as this

Keep it inside
And swallow whatever it is that keeps you warm
Holding back from what's to come
I crush you
I take it back cause you're all that I've been up to
I can't react and it's numbing me
And taking up all of my time
So quiet
There's more to me that I have yet to find

Keep it inside
And swallow whatever it is that keeps you warm
Keep it inside
And swallow whatever it is that keeps you warm

Take it slowly
I thought the trees were begging me to climb
Take it slowly
There's more to me that I have yet to find
Take it slowly
Even though you're always on my mind
Take it slowly
There's more to me that I have yet to find
When I get to see your face again
Can't help the way that I have been
When keeping quiet's become a trend
That's why it's hard for me to end
All the countless hours I would spend
Making it work out up in my head
Now I'm filled up with only regret
There is no way to just forget

I'm a wounded man on top of trees
Gazing at the world below my feet
Fickle feelings find a way to me
Like hard winds blowing when we're lost at sea
