I always felt that I had quite a gift as a judge of human character
This is the day and the time and the place and I wonder, wonder where you are
Surely, we set it for 3pm
Surely, we said it was March the 10th

(Equator, Equator)
You said you'd meet me there
You must be just around the bend

All of the gifts are now melted or dead, and I'm, sorry, sorry in advance
I'll make it up to you, that I can promise you, if I am given just half the chance
God, you'll be laughing, I look a mess
But you see I've been half way around this place
(Equator, Equator)
You said you'd meet me there
(Equator, equator)
You said you'd be right there
(Equator, Equator)
Oh, yeah

I've got to stop here and rest for a moment, I'm sure that you're not far away
You always walked just as slow as you talked, letting me think I could have my way
I wasn't fooled for a second, girl
I knew it was you who controlled our world
(Equator, Equator)
You said you'd meet me there
(Equator, Equator)
You said you'd be right there
(Equator, Equator)
