Slow down
Give me some time
Turn down
The volume of your cry
Let's take time to find
A place without violence
Let's listen and hear
The true meaning of silence

Time to look.
Time to see.
Time to find.

Time to look into your eyes
Time to find truth
Time against the lies
Time will give us a sign
I can make a promise
It's our time to shine

Just listen
Take a look around
Stop missing
The things you haven't found
You will realize
There's no common ground
There's no compromise
Between the time and sound

Time to look.
Time to see.
Time to find.

Time to look into your eyes
Time to find truth
Time against the lies
Time will give us a sign
I can make a promise
It's our time to shine

Time to look.
Time to see.
Time to find.

Time to look into your eyes
Time to find truth
Time against the lies
Time will give us a sign
I can make a promise
It's our time to shine
