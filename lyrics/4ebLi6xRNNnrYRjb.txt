Revelation (Life or Death)
Troubled is the world
Evil in the air
God is here to help
When Satan casts despair
Beast upon the earth
Christians dying
Satan says, "trust me"
He was only lying
Poor souls of earth
In hates desire
Eternal death
In the lake of fire

We don't need no sympathy
From those of you who'll live
We believe in dying
For things that God will give

Lucifer will rule the earth
Seven years of death
God will grant eternal life
For all of you we pray
