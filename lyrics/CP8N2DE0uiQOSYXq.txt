You could've knocked me out with a (feather)
I know you've heard this all before but we're just hell's (neighbors)
Ohhh...
Why, why, why won't the world revolve around me?

Build my dreams, trees grow all over the streets
But I don't know much about classic cars(Cars)
But I've got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke (Coke)
Down, set, one, hut, hut, hike

Media please
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts!
But I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins

Let's hear it for America's suitehearts!
But I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins

You can bow and pretend
That you don't, don't know you're a legend, ohhh
Time, time, time hasn't told anyone else yet

(I'm sorry I just) Let my love loose again
Oh, I don't know much about classic cars (Cars)
But I've got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke (Coke)
Down, set, one, hut, hut, hike

Media please
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts!
But I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins

Let's hear it for America's suitehearts!
But I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins...

You could have knocked me out with a (feather)
I know you've heard this all before

Let's hear it for America's suitehearts!
But I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts!
But I must confess (I must confess)
I'm in love with my own sins (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let's hear it, oh let's hear it
Let's hear it, oh let's
Suitehearts!
(Suitehearts!)
