Where did they go? That which I cherished and that I wrestled,
I don't want to be like the dust that settles.
This empire of nothing,
I find that I'm king of all these empty halls,
That I'm ruled by my own floors.

But you can't be an old fire if you're burning with a new flame,
So remember you were never a forgotten name.

Cos I know a land called the land of the living, it's the world beyond those curtains where we learned the play,
I hear the voices of my childhood singing it's the world beyond those doorways where we used to play.

Every moment is a chance to define what you want to become,
You're not a slave to the things you've done.
Be brave and be bold, be childish and old, it's the same old story,
Every life needs a hope of glory.

But you can't be an old fire if you're burning with a new flame,
So remember you were never a forgotten name.

Cos I know a land called the land of the living, it's the world beyond those curtains where we learned the play,
I hear the voices of my childhood singing it's the world beyond those doorways where we used to play.

I was born to be free, you were born to free me.

Cos I know a land called the land of the living, it's the world beyond those curtains where we learned the play,
Oh we'll go back, we'll go back to the beginning and we'll pickup on the trails of forgotten ways.
