If you hate me after what I say
Can't put it off any longer
Just gotta tell you anyway

Bye bye baby, baby goodbye
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)
Bye bye baby, don't make me cry
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)

You're the one girl in town I'd marry
Girl, I'd marry you now if I were free
I wish it could be

I could love you but why begin it
'Cause there ain't any future in it
She's got me but I'm not free, so

Bye bye baby, baby goodbye
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)
Bye bye baby, don't make me cry
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)

Wish I never had known you better
Wish I knew you before I met her, gee
How good it would be for me

Should've told her that I can't linger
There's a wedding ring on my finger
She's got me and I'm not free, so

Bye bye baby, baby goodbye
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)
Bye bye baby, don't make me cry
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)

Baby bye bye
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)
Baby bye bye
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)
Baby bye bye
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)
Baby bye bye
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)
Baby bye bye
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)
