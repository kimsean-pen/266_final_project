Sat beside the meadow watching weeds agrow
Cleaned up all the ashes of my soul
Wrote down my own sentence
Now you take your way
Fades the last remembrance
Of your lovely pretty face

I... after all
Just a lonely man
A lonely heart!

Working on the future, floating on fate
Faced the circunstances
Cleared up the shades

So make believe
There's no sorrow in your eyes
Can't you see
We could never get back from the start
Minutes waiting, life's been wasted
Maybe I wanna die some other day
Another day

Hear the whispers of your hope
The answer wasn't told
No, don't laugh seeing me cry
The end I've left behind (the whispers of your hope are left behind!)

Make believe
There's no sorrow in your eyes
Can't you see
We could never get back from the start
Minutes waiting, life's been wasted

And I've tried
Maybe you deny
Words of peace
For the future of our lives
Bring to me
Something else than a broken heart
I won't wait 'till my life is wasted
Maybe I wanna die some other day
Another day
