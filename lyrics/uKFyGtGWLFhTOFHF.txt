City of screaming statues
Your soul will grow to understand and respect this place
It will be with your in your heart, on your journey

The gates of city lies before you
The temple of truth whispering their waves
Chase your visions, slay your fears
What moves the truth is the sound of your thoughts

Scream

The struggle of the soul
Depends on the strength of your will
Among the twisted shapes of your madness
You will find your light and your genius
In the city where the statues they scream
For their truth to be real

The dreams and the visions
The reality and the light
Within the soul of the city
May be whatever you wish it to be
In the city where the statues they scream
For their truth to be real

Stand up and turn your back on reality
Lie down and let your dreams attack
The silence of a soul that is true
Is the silence that you lack
Feel the strength pulsating through you
As the gates they close behind you

The answers lie within the city
Within the light
In the sunrise of your soul, time is the key
The music of the truth, now behold

Rise and crush them

The gates of city lies before you
The temple of truth whispering their waves
Chase your visions, slay your fears
What moves the truth is the sound of your thoughts

The statues they scream
For their truth to be real
Within the walls of the city
Where death aint the end

The music of the truth, the light of the end
