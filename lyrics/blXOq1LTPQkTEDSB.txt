Wielding words like a blade
You cut me off and shut me up
And like Silva's face you're just in the wrong place
But this was no honest mistake

And I couldn't fake a smile to save my life
And the tightness in my chest argues for another late night
And I just stopped by to see if you were alone like me

Hey skinny legs, I'm coming to you
I've got a heart that wants a lot
Can't this feeling last forever
Probably not, I'm young at heart
There is a light and it went out
A shaved head and a boring night
So skinny legs, I'm coming to you
I'm afraid not ever, never, no
