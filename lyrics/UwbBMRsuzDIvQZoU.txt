Hold up
Got these feelings in a bad place
It's ok
I'm just hanging by a thread today

Hey hey
It's alright
I'm not running from these monsters
But I'll wait for you to come down from that Milky Way

Look at the guns look at the gold
Look at the sky look at the smoke
Look at the kids look at what we sold out
Of this place

I will wait
I will wait
I will wait for you to come down
I'd really like to meet you
Like to meet you
I will wait
I will wait
I will wait for you to come down
I'd really like to meet you
Like to meet you

Hold up
You're an angel kind of nervous
It's ok
You did nothing to deserve this fate

Look at the guns look at the gold
Look at the sky look at the smoke
Look at the kids look at what we sold out
Of this place

I will wait
I will wait
I will wait for you to come down
I'd really like to meet you
Like to meet you
I will wait
I will wait
I will wait for you to come down
I'd really like to meet you
Like to meet you
I will wait
I will wait
I will wait for you to come down
I'd really like to meet you
Like to meet you
I will wait
I will wait
I will wait for you to come down
I'd really like to meet you
Like to meet you
I will wait
I'd like to meet you
Look at the guns look at the gold
Look at the sky look at the smoke
Look at the kids look at what we sold out
I'd like to meet you
