I saw you from across the street today
My heart skipped a beat today
Reminding me of those lost days
And glory never fades
Never fades...
Fades Away

I've been using miles my broken feet
Walk back to you on this broken street
I guess that years went by but the years just made you shy
You never fade...
Fade Away

I heard someone say
That nothing Gold can stay
But there's a love in all our souls
And it shines like gold
It shines like gold

I saw you from across the street today
My heart skipped a beat today
Reminding me of those lost days
And glory never fades

Years passed by and you remind me
Those things will always find me
Young hearts are made of gold
That never fades away
Never fades...
Fades away

I heard someone say
That nothing Gold can stay
But there's a love in all our souls
And it shines like gold, gold

As the years pass by
A young heart beats inside
These dreams of yours and mine
That time can't take away
Take away
Take away

I heard someone say
That nothing Gold can stay
But there's a love in all our souls
And it shines like gold

I heard someone say
That nothing Gold can stay
But there's a love in all our souls
And it shines like gold
It shines like gold
It shines like gold
