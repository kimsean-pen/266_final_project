Stone, cast me out
So I can feel it in another way, I won't talk about
Warned, passenger's hide
If I could feed it for another day it might run me dry

I know the seasons evolve to a freeze
Putting hearts in the balance here
It's up to your knees and it's shifting degrees
And it's choking your atmosphere

Stone, wind me out
So I can feel it in another way they won't talk about
Warned, massacre sides
Distant figure in a photograph, another eye

I know your reason is stout
And your freedom's dissolved in your passion dear
It's burning your eyes and it's killing your mind
And it's broken your atmosphere

But should you find it's obscene in that gray
All dramatic series young hearts say
Lord, if you've got loss
Come on, shout me out

I know the season's unfolding
It's putting your love into action dear
It's up in the breeze and it's shifting degrees
And it's opened your atmosphere

So should you decide it's obscene in that gray
All dramatic series young hearts say
Lord, it's you've got loss
Come on, shout me
