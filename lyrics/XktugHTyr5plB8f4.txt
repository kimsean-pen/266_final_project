Dead parents and a lack of pity
Dead parents with a knack for shitty luck
And I know you wanna go home
And I know he's gonna take you home
But you're the house that I wanna live in
You're the home that I dreamt of building
But dead parents,
what a slack and pretty way of saying something I don't mean

I got Viv in the front seat
And I got it all out in front of me
And you, you in my mind all of the time

Proud parents and a baby
Vowed one day we would name him after him
And I hope he's got your eyes

I got Viv in the front seat
And I got it all out in front of me
And you, you in my mind all of the time

And when I die, I'll die happy
First and full and completely
With you, you in my mind all of the time

I could've died when I said what I said in front of you
I could've tried harder to feel the way you do
You could've lied and said that 'It's okay, it's no big deal.'
But what you said: 'It fucking sucks. It always has and always will.'

I got Viv in the front seat
And I got it all out in front of me
And you, you in my mind all of the time

And when I die, I'll die happy
First and full and completely
With you, you in my mind all of the time

I felt my life change
