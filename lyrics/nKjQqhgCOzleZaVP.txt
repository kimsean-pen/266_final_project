Remember when I left you
I couldn't say your name
Or other crucial things like I love you
And that's a shame

Oh no, I think I'm falling
Oh no, I think I'm fine
Our hearts didn't come together
But I saw the two collide

I can the see the hearts sinking
Remember when I left you
I couldn't say your name
Or other crucial things like I love you
And that's a shame

Oh no, I think I'm falling
Oh no, I think I'm fine
Our hearts didn't come together
But I saw the two collide

I can the see the hearts sinking
I can the see the hearts sinking

I can the see the hearts sinking
I can the see the hearts sinking
