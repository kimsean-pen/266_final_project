look what you've done, look what you've done what do you have now?
things that never come, I'm laying here in a dead-end room
is it time to come down?

at the back of a crowded scene
you saw the boys in white sing
"I'm a pretender"
but you never were, you never were a contender

I heard your same old tune, singing city sins
like you were the first one
gave up books for film, gave up film for time
now that you've got none
