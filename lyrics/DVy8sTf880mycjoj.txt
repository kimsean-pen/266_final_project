It's not just what you say
Or how you come so far
The words that you repeat
In times you're twice apart
That smug look on your face
When you have something to hide
Well at least that's what I think
Maybe I'm out of touch
You tell me if I'm wrong
But you know I'm right

Spit far spit fast I'm needing
I'm sure this won't linger
Longer than it has to
Get out of my way stead fast I'm leaving
I'm a certain kind of way
I'm a certain kind of way, tonight
I know it can't be in my head
It must be what of you
Who keep pulling me aside
To chit chat about me
Who I am
What the deal is with who I was once
