It ain't no big thing to wait for the bell to ring
It ain't no big thing the toll of the bell

Aggravated spare for days
I troll down town, the red light place
Jump up bubble up, what's in store?
Love is the drug and I need to score

Showing out, showing out hit and run
Boy meets girl where the beat goes on
Stitched up tight can't shake free
Love is the drug got a hook on me

Oh, oh catch that buzz
Love is the drug I'm thinking of
Oh, oh can't you see?
Love is the drug for me
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Late that night I parked my car
Staked my place in the singles bar
Face to face, toe to toe
Heart to heart as we hit the floor

Lumber up limbo down
The locked embrace, stumble round
I say go, she says yes
Dim the lights you can guess the rest

Oh, oh catch that buzz
Love is the drug I'm thinking of
Oh, oh can't you see?
Love is the drug, got a hook in me

Oh, oh get that buzz
Love is the drug I'm thinking of
Oh, oh can't you see?
Love is the drug for me

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Love is, love is, love is the drug
