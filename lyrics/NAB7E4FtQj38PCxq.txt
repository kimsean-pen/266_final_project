Yes, I know that love is like ghosts
Oh, few have seen it, but everybody talks
Spirits follow me where I go
Oh, they sing all day, and they haunt me in the night
Oh, they sing all day, and they haunt me in the night
Yes, I know that love is like ghosts
Oh, and what ain't living can never really die
You don't want me, baby, please don't lie
Oh, but if you're leaving, I gotta know why
I said, if you're leaving I gotta know why
Oh, I sing all day and I love you through the night

Yes, I know that love is like ghosts
Oh, and the moonlight, baby, shows you what's real
There ain't langauge for the things I feel
And if I can't have you, then no one ever will
Oh, If I can't have you, then no one ever will

I don't feel it 'til it hurts sometimes
Oh, go on, baby, hurt me tonight
I want ours to be an endless song
Baby, in my eyes, you can do no wrong
I don't feel it 'til it hurts sometimes
Oh, go on, baby, hurt me tonight
Haunted spirits that I know I saw
They see ghosts in me at all

Oh, I sing all day and I love you through the night
Oh, I sing all day and I love you through the night
Oh, I sing all day and I love you through the night
