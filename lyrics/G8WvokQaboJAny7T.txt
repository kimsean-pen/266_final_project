Sorry for the fools who say
That an animal can't understand
Or feel in any way
Sorry their blood runs so cold
Sorry they have no heart no soul

Sorry for all of your pain
Sorry for everything you have to face
Sorry I can't do enough
I'm so sorry they don't know love

I arm myself with different shades
I harm myself I'm loosing faith
I arm myself with the taste of hope
A new beginning a new dawn

The bridge we built will one day fall
I can't take it no more
I see their fate when I close my eyes
I hear their cries all threw the night

I wish I could take you all in my arms
Take you away where they'll will do you no harm
The guilt I feel that I can't do more
I'm sorry so sorry

I want to give you a loving home
Into the light out of the cold
The guilt I feel that I can't do more
I'm sorry so sorry

So sorry
So sorry
So sorry
So sorry
