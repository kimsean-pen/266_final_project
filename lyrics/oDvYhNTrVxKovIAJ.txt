Death comes sweeping through the hallway
Like a lady's dress
Death comes driving down the highway
In its Sunday best

A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby away
A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby away

Swept her up and off my wavelength
Swallowed her up
Like the ocean in a fire
So thick and grey

A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby away
A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby away

Death comes driving
I can't do nothing
Death goes
There must be something
There must be something
That remains
There must be something
There must be something

A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby away
A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby
Took my baby away
