Some people say that i'm a monster
And i can say that they are wrong, but
I'm bad, i'm bad
And i can never change it
I'm mad, i'm mad
And you won't have to face it
My head is feeling so conflicted
How can i be so damn addicted?
You know you know that i ain't playing
You know you know...
If you want a soldier, then maybe i am
If you want a warrior, then maybe i am
You can't run away, you can't run away
It's in my dna, its' in my dna
If you want a killer, then maybe i am
If you want a thriller, then maybe i am
You can't run away, you can't run away
It's in my dna, its' in my dna
I don't ever wanna change me
I am just the girl i should be
I'm bad, i'm bad
I see you kinda like it
I'm mad, i'm mad
No use tryin to fight it
How can i be so conflicted?
We should't be so damn restricted
You know you know that i ain't playing
You know you know...
If you want a soldier, then maybe i am
If you want a warrior, then maybe i am
You can't run away, you can't run away
It's in my dna, its' in my dna
If you want a killer, then maybe i am
If you want a thriller, then maybe i am
You can't run away, you can't run away
It's in my dna, its' in my dna
Oh yeah
You cannot escape
You can't run away
It's in my dna
It's in my dna
I know i can't escape
In this getaway
It's in my dna
It's in my dna
If you want a soldier, then maybe i am
If you want a warrior, then maybe i am
You can't run away, you can't run away
It's in my dna, its' in my dna
If you want a killer, then maybe i am
If you want a thriller, then maybe i am
You can't run away, you can't run away
It's in my dna, its' in my dna
Oh yeah
(you can't run away, run run run away)
(you can't run away, run run run away)
(you can't run away, run run run away)
(you can't run away, run run run away)
