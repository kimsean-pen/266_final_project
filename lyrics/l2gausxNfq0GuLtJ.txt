I never said I could walk on water
Stuck in my head; wish the path made sense.
I never said I could make you better.
What did you expect from me?
Under the weight I'm thrown into despair
No solace, no peace
I sit alone and stare

No one ever says what they really want.
All we do is guess if they show us anything past the surface.
Plagued, we don't get any rest.
We are forced to play the game and never question it.

Follow progress, but nothing ever works.
Maybe we can never change, all we do is hurt.
Can we put a price on what we left?
Can we ever change the ignorant?

Can we ever change the ignorant?
I didn't come here to just be a slave
Problems embedded in greed
(Lives wasted)
There's too much at stake now to let yourself
Be distracted.

We hate, we waste, we spend
Trapped inside your head
Disdain we can't defend
No honor here.

I never said I could walk on water
Stuck in my head; wish the path made sense.
I never said I could make you better.
What did you expect from me?
Under the weight I'm thrown into despair
No solace, no peace
I sit alone and stare

I fear this ringing in my head.
My call to lose control of my actions and attack.
It's not too far in the past.
The shame I feel is nothing compared to the scars upon my skin
In the wake of all my sin.

I sat back and I let the devil in me.
I sat back and I let it in.

I never said I could walk on water
Stuck in my head; wish the path made sense.
I never said I could make you better.
What did you expect from me?
Under the weight I'm thrown into despair
No solace, no peace
I sit alone and stare
