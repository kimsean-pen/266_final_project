Aniseed kisses and lipstick traces,
Lemonade sipped in Belgian rooms,
Couldn't replace the graceful notions
That clung to me when I clung to you.

And they touch you like no one touched you.
When you broke they were there with glue.
And their kindness is not a weakness.
When they are there they are there for you.

But will they love you, the way, the way I loved you?
We jumped over the barriers.
Jumped over the barriers.

And our world, it was wrapped in tinsel,
Invitations and fountain pens.
But the heart is a lonely hunter,
It trapped you once and it will trap you again.

But will they love you, the way, the way I loved you?
We jumped over the barriers.
Jumped over the barriers.

Will they love you, the way, the way I loved you?
We jumped over the barriers.
Jumped over the barriers.

(Oh oh oh oh oh oh...)
Jumped over the barriers
Jumped over the barriers
Jumped over the barriers
Jumped over the barriers
