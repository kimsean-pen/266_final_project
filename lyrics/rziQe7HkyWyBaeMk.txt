It all went to far knowing that we'd turned our heartbeats off
On repeat never feel complete again
Be a good machine follow every move dance let 'em rule
In a world where we share but no one cares
Is this how we want it?
Is this how it should be?

We just wanna feel human only human only human wanna feel alive again
Only human only human (ooh)
We just wanna feel alive again not wired in
Not a part of the illusion
We just wanna feel human

Post yourself get likes feed with lies and we are all digitized
Search your heart go offline look deep inside (Deep inside)

Entertained play games
All the pictures of your own face
It's all fake just a bait to keep your dreams away
Is this how we want it?
Is this how it should be?

We just wanna feel human only human only human wanna feel alive again
Only human only human (ooh)
We just wanna feel alive again not wired in
Not a part of the illusion
We just wanna feel human (human)

Wanna feel alive again
We wanna feel we go offline to live our lives again
We're only human only human
Again we wanna feel we go offline to live our lives again
We're only human

We just wanna feel human only human only human wanna feel alive again
Only human only human (ooh)
We just wanna feel alive again not wired in
Not a part of the illusion
We just wanna feel human only human
Only human wanna feel alive again
Only human wanna feel alive again
I just wanna feel human wanna feel human
We just wanna feel only human only human (ooh)
