I'll tell you little secret
Make you want to jump and shout
When you talk to me in cycles
Take your foot out of your mouth
It's hard enough to make it
When you livin' on the street

And you want to tell somebody
But you got to be discreet
Then you catch your girlfriend
With a state of the year

Honey, don't get mad
Get even
Don't get mad, get even
Don't get mad, get even

Don't get mad, get even
Say the times, they be a changin'
Oh, the blind need the blind

You know your head is empty
Though there's somethin' on your mind
You been shackin' up with Lucy
And when the mornin' comes

You're with Sally in the alley
And the junkies and the bums
You wonder why your girlfriend
Hasn't stepped up to here

Honey, don't get mad
Get even
Don't get mad, get even
Don't get mad, get even

Don't get mad, get even
You just wait and see what I got in store for you
Rolling dice, they lucky
'Cause they roll you all the time

You got nothing else to lose
If you only lose your mind
When pleasure's at a shallow 'cause
There's trouble to the deep
You be dustin' with the devil
While is sweeps you off your feet
I tell you little secret
Make you want to jump and shout

When you talk to me in cycles
Take your foot out of your mouth
It's hard enough to make it
When you're livin' on the street
And you hate to be a wise guy
When your feet are in concrete
Oh, sleepin' with the dogs
And you wake up with the fleas
Honey, don't get mad
Get even
Don't get mad, get even
Don't get mad, get even
Don't get mad, get even
