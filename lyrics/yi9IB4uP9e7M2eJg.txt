When the sins of my father.
Way down in my soul, and the pain of my mother will not let me go.
Well I know they can't fire from the sky to refine the purest of canes.
Even though I know this fire brings me pain, even so lord just the same.
Make it rain, make it rain, make it rain, make it rain.
Make it rain, make it rain, make it rain, make it rain.
The seed needs the water for it grows out the ground.
It just keeps getting hard, and the hunger more profound.
And I know they can't cut tears from the eye, but they might as well be invane.
Even though I know these tears will bring me pain, even so Lord just same.
Oh make it rain, make it rain, make it rain, make it rain.
Make it rain .
Well the sea is filled with water, stops by the shore.
Just like the riches of grandour never reach the port.
Let the clouds fill with thunderess applause, the lightning be the veins.
Fill the sky with all they can draw, it's time to make a change.
Make it rain oh Make it rain down lord, make it rain, make it rain.
