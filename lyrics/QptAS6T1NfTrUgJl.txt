YEAH!!!
Strength of the mind
Looking back on the life that I lived
What I leave behind
Mistakes and memories serve to remind
(They serve me to remind)
The reflection staring back from the mirror
No longer looks like me
Strength of the mind to fight what's inside
It takes strength of the mind
Before I lose control
Who can raise you from the fall and save you
Only you
Who can take the pain away and change you
Only you
A thousand miles between this never ending feeling
Just looking for something more
Searching for a release
I've seen rock bottom and I've smashed my fists against it
Just keep telling yourself it will be alright
Who can raise you from the fall and save you
Only you
Who can take the pain away and change you
Only you
Gather all your pain and suffering
Turn them into strength and weaponry
To overcome the enemy
That's in you
(That's in you)
That's in you
(That's in you)
Come face to face with a war that rages in you
Who can take the pain away
Only you
Who can raise you from the fall and save you (and save you)
And save you
Only you
Strength of the mind
Before I lose control
