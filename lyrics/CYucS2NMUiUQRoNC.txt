When the guns of the crew, a future
I can't say just how I got here
Ruins somewhere in a black room
Someone's singing
Who? I don't know

Do you die in your dreams?
I don't even have them
Have you ever known love?
You haven't even seen me

Dream on, sister
Cherish the lodges
Wouldn't want to stay too long here
People reaching on the platform
Someone will save you
When? I don't know

Have you ever known love?
Have you even seen me?
At this pace I will go blind
By the time I find my vision

Angel, I do not know how long we'll last
We have barely just made it through the past
Angel, we may have celebrated too soon
The villains of the moon are doomed

In the time of the empty throne
I can not remember what I've known
White knuckle in the dead of snow
Someone is calling
Why? I don't know
Can you say what you want?
I never could
I'd be embarrassed to be buried here
To overstay my welcome

Angel, I do not know how long we'll last
We have barely just made it through the past
Angel, we may have celebrated too soon
The villains of the moon are doomed

When you're from nothing
You can do anything you want
When you're from nowhere
You can go anywhere you want
But you're here
Do you even know why?
Have you ever wondered
What I would do if I did not have you?

Angel, I do not know how long we'll last
We have barely just made it through the past
Angel, we may have celebrated too soon
The villains of the moon are doomed

Angel, I do not know how long we'll last
We have barely just made it through the past
Angel, we must have celebrated too soon
We are the villains of the moon and doomed
