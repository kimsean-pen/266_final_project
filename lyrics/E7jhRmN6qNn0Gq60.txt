I don't know where I went wrong
Guess I felt good for too long
Make me happy when I feel this way
I stick with things that never change
I know you want more
I need you but I don't know what for
I think too much
I think too sweet
I think too much
I think I'm at your feet
I've been thinking 'bout what you said
I'll fake a smile but it's in my head
And if I could I would meet you again
Just so I could take it all in
I know you're my blue eyed baby
And its no surprise but it was never clear to me
You are my only love
You are the only thought I think of
I don't know where I went wrong
Guess I felt good for too long
Make me happy when I feel this way
I stick with things that never change
