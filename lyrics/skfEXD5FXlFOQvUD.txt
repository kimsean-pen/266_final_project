Where have you been?
Where have you been?
I've covered the streets
Recovered into everlasting leaps

You know it's always been my heart
You know I always fall apart
It's not my fault, it's just my flaw
It's who I am
You know it's always been my heart
You know I always fall apart
It's not my fault, it's just my flaw
It's who I am

You turn me in to a museum
You kept me from the growing weeds
When all you wanted was the best
From me, that is the test
Can you keep me from?
You can't explain me

You know it's always been my heart
You know I always fall apart
It's not my fault, it's just my flaw
It's who I am

I can't believe the way I've been
I've been resentful and I've sinned
I need you now just as a friend
I need a hand held, not a pushing
I need a way to help me to stand only to crash
I know who I am and what I've done
Don't know what I'd do but when
I look to my side I'll be a friend
Where have you been?
