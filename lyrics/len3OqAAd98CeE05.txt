Lucille, you won't you do your sister's will
Lucille, you won't you do your sister's will
You ran off and married but I love you still

Lucille, please, come back where you belong
Lucille, please, come back where you belong
I been good to you, baby, please, don't leave me alone

I woke up this mornin', Lucille was not in sight
I asked my friends about her but all their lips were tight
Lucille, please, come back where you belong
I been good to you, baby, please, don't leave me alone
Whoa

I woke up this mornin', Lucille was not in sight
I asked my friends about her but all their lips were tight
Lucille, please, come back where you belong
I been good to you, baby, please, don't leave me alone

Lucille, baby, satisfy my heart
Lucille, baby, satisfy my heart
I played for it, baby and gave you such a wonderful start
