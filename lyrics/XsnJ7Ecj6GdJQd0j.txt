Sit down, shut up and let me buy you a drink
I'm done caring about what other people think
They don't know shit and neither do I
Just have another one and try to look alive

It's only natural
You're feeling the way that you do
One foot in front of the other
Just trying to keep your cool

'Cause there's monsters in the shadows
And they've got the urge to kill
So you'd better pay attention
'Cause if you don't, best believe that they will

Sit down, shut up and let me buy you a drink
I'm done caring about what other people think
They don't know shit and neither do I
Shut your mouth kid and try to stay alive

You put your hands together
Staring straight into the sky
'Cause you're still not cool with yourself
And you're still afraid to die

Well, congratulations, mister
You got that look in your eye
You think you're better than everyone
Well, you're fucking not

Sit down, shut up and let me buy you a drink
I'm done caring about what other people think
They don't know shit and neither do I
Just have another one and try to stay alive

Sit down, shut up and let me buy you a drink
I'm done hearing what the rest of them think
They don't know shit and neither do I
Just have another one and try to stay
