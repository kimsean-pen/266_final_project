Things seem so hectified now, I ain't gots me no peace
I'm, well, entirely pent up now, can't gets me no release
Started jotting stupid things down
I could repeat later on
When I feel the timing's just right
I hope no one here's heard this song... this song
Cause we've retired all that came before

Well I talked about the future
Lord knows we've talked about the past
When I know the time is just right
Good God I only hope it lasts.
I got some friends who feel important
Seems they've swayed some who really are
It's just a trick of natural lighting
Make your mind see very far... so far
Cause we've retired all that came before

It's mans way to think
No one could handle what he's been through
What was alright for me
Would not work for you

Can you believe in anything now
Now everything's believable
Thought I might bring up the future
If that's at all conceivable
Cause I'm a slave to all that's insight
Hovering round the truth awhile
Like some messenger of alright
Who wears upon his face a smile... I'm smiling
Cause we've retired all that came before
