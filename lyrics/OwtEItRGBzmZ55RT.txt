You see the Sunday bird swinging low
The fever in your brain only grows
and The Murder Boys are running down the street
You can see 'em through the window from your seat
Hear the sound of the mightiest of guns

And the shadows go like ghosts across your road
Oh take the world and burn it in a spoon
A mercy ship to sail you off to sleep
To where the crimson angels swim the deep
There's no hiding from the mightiest of guns

With every breath you drink in the night
You won't give up your blue without a fight
And looking at the sky there is no pain
See the stars all falling down like burning rain
They were fired by the mightiest of guns

Tomorrow I'll be out of my mind
The bear will dance and the organ will grind
And I'm laughing 'cause I know there ain't no sin
All the world on the head of a pin
Turning fast beneath the mightiest of guns
Turning fast beneath the mightiest of guns
