Once I knew an ancient beauty
Woke in the morning on hearing word of my fate
Now she is bound by fear within the harem
But one night with the master is all the love she is worth

Oh to have been born a thousand years later
She'd be a girl in the window dancing unknowing for me
Now all her trials concealed in the story of millions
A love no less worthy spirited now in the mist

Endless night, endless night, endless night
Endless night, endless night, endless night
