Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Since you shipped my ass off to sea
I never knew where I was going
I went where the water was flowing

I know I've been gone a long time but
I'm back and I want what is mine
I know I've been gone a long time but
I'm back and I want what is mine

The ship was the love of my life
We went down together that night
I surfaced and married a shell
For years I just cruised on the run

I know I've been gone a long time but
I'm back and I want what is mine
I know I've been gone a long time but
I'm back and I want what is mine

So don't try and fuck me about
The worst thing that happened was
I was standing too close to your heart
I'm tired and about to wake up

I know I've been gone a long time but
I'm back and I want what is mine
I know I've been gone a long time but
I'm back and I want what is mine
Oh, I know I've been gone a long time but
I'm back and I want what is mine
I know I've been gone a long time but
I'm back and I want what is mine
