I've seen oceans part
Worlds collide
None of it
Leaves me satisfied
What do I (What do I)
Hope to find? (Hope to find?)
If I were immortal
And impervious to pain
I'd still find a reason to complain
I see the wonders
I'm not blind
I've just got a one track mind
That serves a dark train
That serves a dark train
