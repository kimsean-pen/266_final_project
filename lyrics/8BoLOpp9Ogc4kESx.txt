Why is that we stand so still? (still)
People gonna start thinking we're statues (aha)
This silence is disturbing me
People talk but I can't hear

I'm off the hook (Auuuh)
Off the hook
I think I'm off the hook, baby
Off the hook

Let's find us both a place to sit
The more I talk the more my bones get heavy
The silence is disturbing me
Don't they know I can't read lips?

I'm off the hook (Auuuh)
Off the hook

I think I'm off the hook, baby
Off the hook

yeah.
Yeah, you were right this is really fun
I never got this dumb before

Off the hook (Auuuh)
Off the hook
I think I'm off the hook, baby
Off the hook

Why is that we stand so still?
People gonna start thinking we're statues
The silence is disturbing me
People talk but I can't hear
I'm off the hook.
