I don't want to live without your love
I had let it go to waste
I don't want to live without your love
Drag it to an open window
Shred it in a million pieces
I don't want to live without your love

Funny how we do without
Everything we trade away
Only in November when it's cold
Do we miss the warmth of
Every wound ever opened
Every man to ever see you
You should take advantage of the summer

'Cause if you're alone, if you're alone, how can I save you?
I'll find a way to make your love more complicated
What if I could change, if I could change, if you could save me?
Still find a way to miss a thousand times

'Cause I don't want to live without your love
Oh, oh
I tell you what you want to hear if
What you want is incomplete
I don't want to live without your love

I don't mind how much it changes
I can look the other way
I seem to remember how it felt
To be crushed by something
Walk until you see the water
Just in case it disappears
Take advantage of the summer

'Cause if you're alone, if you're alone, how can I save you?
I'll find a way to make your love more complicated
What if I could change, if I could change, if you could save me?
Still find a way to miss a thousand times

And I would just sit in my car
Listening to distant alarms go
They seem far, so far, so
Feeling the weight of the world
Nothing compared to the long road
That seems hard, so hard, so

And I would just sit in my car
Listening to distant alarms go
They seem far, so far, so
Feeling the weight of the world
It's nothing compared to the long road
That seems hard, so hard, so

'Cause if you're alone, if you're alone, how can I save you?
I'll find a way to make your love more complicated
What if I could change, if I could change, if you could save me?
Still find a way to miss a thousand times
