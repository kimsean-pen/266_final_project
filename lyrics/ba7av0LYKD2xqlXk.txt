I got your message on the phone
It says -I'm feeling all alone
And I'm the one to blame, well
At least that's according to what you say
But I think you're wrong
We we're never meant to belong

When you've got nothing to hold on
You blame it all on me
You need something to hold on, besides me
When you've got nothing to hold on
You blame it all on me
You need something to hold on, besides me, yeah
Yea-ah

It felt like turning into stone
Made sure my feelings didn't show
How could I be accused when deep inside you
Always knew
That you could be wrong
That I'd be long gone

When you've got nothing to hold on
You blame it all on me
You need something to hold on, besides me
When you've got nothing to hold on
You blame it all on me
You need something to hold on, besides me, yeah
Yea-ah

You blame it
You blame it all on me

Ooohh

You blame it all on me
Blame, Blame
Blame it all on me
Don't blame it
Don't blame it
Blame it all on me
When you've got nothing to hold on
You blame it all on me
You need something to hold on, besides me
