I'm better off, better off without you
I'm better off, better off, I don't need you
Someday soon
I'll be gone for good

Careful
Overthinking's made me spiteful, oh well
I'm done
Being part of your cycle
And this downward spiral

Don't you know that I can see you fading?
One can only take so much
Don't you wish I couldn't see you breaking apart?
Guess it means you've lost your touch
I've finally realized

I'm better off, better off without you
I'm better off, better off, I don't need you
Someday soon
I'll be gone for good

Let me
Say the things I couldn't mention, oh well
I'm done
Feeling pity for your problems when you need attention

Don't you know that I can see you fading?
One can only take so much

I'm better off, better off without you
I'm better off, better off, I don't need you
Someday soon
I'll be gone for good

I think it's time that I'm alone
And truth be told, I know it's wrong
That I keep reliving the memories in my way
But I can't stop
I think it's time that I'm alone
And truth be told, I know it's wrong
I keep reliving the memories in my way

I finally realized

I'm better off, better off without you
I'm better off, better off, I don't need you
Someday soon
I'll be gone for good

I'm better off, better off without you
I'm better off, better off, I don't need you
Someday soon
I'll be gone for good
