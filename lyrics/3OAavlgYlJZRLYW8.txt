Turn off the radio

There's something missing,
there's an anger livin half the world away.
I hope you listen for a person,
with perspective,
That isn't always the same.
No need to water it down right now,
you play the victim,
but it's all a charade.
Times they, they are a-changin'
get your things in order,
or get out the way.

And it goes on and on and on.

Turn off the radio till they've got something real to say.
Turn off the radio to clear my mind and let me think.
I need an answer, I've got the questions.
Can't anyone out there just relate?
Turn off the radio.

There's a division in our culture that we live with every day.
We're just people eating people.
Such a sick sad world we live in today.
All I know's I wanna be everything expected of me.
So everyone we can agree somebody out there understands me.

And it goes on and on and on.

Turn off the radio till they've got something real to say.
Turn off the radio to clear my mind and let me think.
I need an answer, I've got the questions.
Can't anyone out there just relate?
Turn off the radio.

Someone out there if you're listening
We're the victims of our indifference.
Tell us more without controlling
what we think with what you're showing

Turn off the radio till they've got something real to say.
Turn off the radio to clear my mind and let me think.
I need an answer, I've got the questions.
Can't anyone out there just relate?
Turn off the radio.
