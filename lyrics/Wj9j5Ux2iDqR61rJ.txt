In the corner of my room, there's a pile of things that still belong to you
And I'll give 'em back, but here tonight
I'll go through 'em one by one without a fight
And I don't care if I cry, it should hurt you said goodbye
and I have the right to drag it out and make it worse
I'm going to take my time, 'til I wake up one morning and I find
That I feel better.

Outside my window, there's the moon
and it's saying don't get over you too soon
So I'll keep breaking until I'm done
and I get it through my head you weren't the one
And I don't care if I cry, it should hurt you said goodbye
and I have the right to drag it out and make it worse
I'm going to take my time, 'til I wake up one morning and I find
That I feel better.

Better

'Til I look at your pictures and run out of tears
and you're not all I'm thinking about
'Til I don't turn around, hold my breath for the sound
of you saying my name out loud

Oh Whoa Oh Oh Oh

And I don't care if I cry, it should hurt you said goodbye
and I have the right to drag it out and make it worse
I'm going to take my time, 'til I wake up one morning and I find
That I feel better.

Better
