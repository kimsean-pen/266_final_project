I had a dream I was

I had a dream I was
Under the ground
My friends and family
Were buried all around and
A worm took a bite on me
And then he washed down what about you

The same worms that eat me will someday eat you too

They'll eat you

Marble on your feet and marble on my toes
Baby counts the same when our body is decomposed
You'll turn into dirt someday
Same dirt as me
Like one becomes a two and two becomes a three

The same worms that eat me will someday eat you too

I had a dream I was under the ground
My friends and family were buried all around
A worm took a bite on me and then he washed down what about you

What about you?

The same worms that eat me will someday eat you too

They're gonna eat you

They're gonna nibble on your hair

They're gonna eat you up

They're gonna sliver all around you

Touch you everywhere

We got the same worms

We got the same worms

We got the same worms babe

They're gonna eat you

Same worms that eat me will someday eat you too
