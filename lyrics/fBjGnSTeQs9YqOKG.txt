Hush now, don't explain
I know you're
I'm glad you're back
Don't explain

Quiet, don't explain
You mixed with some dame
Skip that lipstick
Don't explain

You know that I love you
And what love endures
All my thoughts of you
For I'm so completely yours

Cry to hear folks chatter
And I know you cheat
But right or wrong, don't matter
When you're with me, sweet

Hush now, don't explain
You're my joy and pain
My life's yours, love
Don't explain
