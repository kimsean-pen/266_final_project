Time slowly goes by
And it is less than a murder
Everyone I love dies
Everyone I know cries

I am looking forward
To the day I meet my father
'Til then I'll keep on trying
To hang on to my family ties

Alive on my brother
A love that built up over the sun
The ages of mystery
And these lies are talking murder

I'll find a way
I will find a way
I'll find a way
I find find it
I find a way
I know, find a way
I find a way, one day, I know
I know
