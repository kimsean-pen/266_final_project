'Cause baby there's something you know
But clearly you say, I'm not good for you
I think that I'm barely in love
You said you don't smoke, you do
Here's something I wrote for you
One time I had love for you

'Cause honestly, you got me gone
From everyone

Times you take my breath away
I'm so in love with you
Now just passing the time
Waiting longer for you
Oh baby ooh oooooh
And baby you know, that I
Never put it on, it was you, you

'Cause honestly, you got me gone
From everyone
