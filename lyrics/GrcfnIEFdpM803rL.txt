One day they came to your doorstep
To take what was yours
Their IDs attached to their suits
Stand still - don't open the door!

You trusted, you cried - they promised, they lied
Now you know - life's hit and miss
Don't let them lead and do as you like
You'd rather die than fall on your knees

There's no rules, life is unfair
You stand alone with a middle finger in the air
Through the good and the bad
Ups and downs, rise and fall
It's only you against them all

They don't care and never did
About all the points you've scored
We walk on the razors edge
We dream of a better world

Can't stand it, can't cope
No future, no hope!
