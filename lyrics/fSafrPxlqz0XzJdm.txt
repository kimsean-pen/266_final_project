You and I'd escape the night and call it summering.
I'd hold your rays and ride for days while you spin endlessly.
You undone, I felt safely strung between all your nerve endings.
So you made waves to congregate and finally ask of me,

"Will you lay with me where the sun hits right?
When the tired days can't remember
how a blurring haze came across your eyes.
Will you lay with me forever?"

Sun.
Focused state. Wide awake in the eye of everything.
You and me twin-firing machines spending all our energy.

I felt the shade cool and grey and glanced up suddenly.
Aurora spray, a horizon away as I shout at the top of me,

"Will you lay with me in the sun tonight?
When the tired days can't remember
how a blurring haze comes across my eyes.
will you lay with me forever, Sun?"

Carved your name across the sky in a fit of exiting.
With the polar night just in sight, will you come and visit me?
You and me twin-firing machines spending all our energy.
If it's you undone, then I can't sit with you.
And it's you undone and I can't sit in your sun.
