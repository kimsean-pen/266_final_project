It's the Lord
It's the Lord

Oh yeah we get it now, we acting wild now
Oh yeah we get it now, we acting wild now
I give my everything I owe, oh its a start
I give you every single thing I give my heart

Father, father help me Lord
Why did the Devil just knock on my door?
Why do these niggas keep tripping
Every time I have a vision they be closing the door
Why do these women stand next to the niggas with money and hope that they get on the blogs
Why does my Momma keep crying and hoping that I'm the one that can get us out the slums
Momma I'm broke I ain't even rich
It's not about the money nigga, really how you think?
Really gotta get it homie time don't wait
God gave you two hands nigga do what it takes, do what it
Its all you, its all you at the end of the day it's all you
Said it once before you bounce back before
Young kid with the juice how about some more

That's your light
I been wondering what my purpose is at night
As soon as I got all the answers it's nothing but love
Tell everybody I'ma go wild wild wild
As for the night how about right now for the night

Oh yeah we get it now, we acting wild now
Oh yeah we get it now, we acting wild now
I give my everything I owe, oh its a start
I give you every single thing I give my heart

Lucifer will not save you
Lose yourself and be a slave to the game
Lose yourself to cocaine and the fame
Lose yourself to all the money that you make
Lose yourself to all the people that you hate
Choose the bed you make, prepare to lay
I'm still the guy that's tryna pave a way
Still divided by the love and hate
Cruise through the city just to think about life
Yeah it's been a minute had to really think deep
Little self doubt, can make you think twice
Giving my all so there's some kind of light
Live through the darkness and live through the pain
Tell you these things that I hope you relate, to
Nothing but love that I crave too
Yeah it's nothing but love that I crave too

That's your light
I been wondering what my purpose is at night
As soon as I got all the answers it's nothing but love
Tell everybody I'ma go wild wild wild
As for the night how about right now for the night

Oh yeah we get it now, we acting wild now
Oh yeah we get it now, we acting wild now
I give my everything I owe, oh its a start
I give you every single thing I give my heart
