On the verge of ruin
You'll see it all clear
How steep the fall is
How long way back is

On the verge of success
It's all white and fluffy
Horizons are blurred
Horizons are blurred

By the time you reach your goal
Tongues will be twisted
To the point where you'll lose
Track of your soul

Distorted pictures is all you deliver
Distorted pictures is all you deliver
Distorted pictures is all you deliver
Distorted pictures is all you deliver
Distorted pictures is all you deliver
