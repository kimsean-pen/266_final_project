I don't wanna hurt you
'Cause I don't think it's a virtue
But you and I have come to our end
Believe me when I tell you that
I never wanna see you again
And please can you stop calling

'Cause it's getting really boring
And I've told you I don't want to be friends
Believe me when I tell you that
I never wanna see you again
How on earth could I be any more obvious?
It never really did and now it's never

Gonna happen with the two of us
I don't understand what it is that you're chasing after
But it makes me really sad to hear
You sound so desperate, it just makes it harder
I can see how it's confusing
It could be considered using

When I call you up straight out of the blue
But I don't understand what else
A girl in my position's to do
Now I know you feel betrayed
But it's been weeks since I got laid
This doesn't mean that I don't think you're a fool
But I don't understand what else
A girl in my position's to do
How on earth could I be any more obvious?
It never really did and now it's never

Gonna happen with the two of us
I don't understand what it is that you're chasing after
But it makes me really sad to hear
You sound so desperate, it just makes it harder

I know it's rather ugly
'Cause I know that you still love me
And this isn't any kind of excuse
I don't love you, I don't love you
How on earth could I be any more obvious?
It never really did and now it's never
Gonna happen with the two of us
I don't understand what it is that you're chasing after
But it makes me really sad to hear
You sound so desperate, it just makes it harder
