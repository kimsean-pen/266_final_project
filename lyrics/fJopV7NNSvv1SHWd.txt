Tried to trail you last night, baby
Trail you in my car
Girl, I was afraid
Of what I was looking for

Yeah, little by little by
I'm losing my love for you
Yeah, little by little by
Found out you was untrue

Alright, Keith, come on, now

Yeah, I try to bear the buzz
A girl's gonna hitch a ride
Things ain't been the same
Since my mother died

Yeah, little by little by
I'm losin' my love for you
Yeah, little by little by
I've found out you was untrue
Get outta here
