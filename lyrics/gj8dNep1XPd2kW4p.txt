You can roll that stone
To the top of the hill
Drag your ball and chain behind you

You can carry that weight
With an iron will
Or let the pain remain behind you

Chip away the stone
Chip away the stone
Make the burden lighter
If you must roll that rock alone

Chip away the stone
Chip away the stone
Make the burden lighter
If you must roll that rock alone

You can drive those wheels
To the end of the road
You will still find the past right behind you

Try to deny
The weight of the load
Try to put the sins of the past night behind you

Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh

Carve away the stone
Carve away the stone
Make a graven image
With some features of your own

Carve away the stone
Carve away the stone
Make a graven image
With some features of your own

You call roll the stone
To the top of the hill
You can carry that weight
With an iron will

You can drive those wheels
To the end of the road
You can try to deny
The weight of the load

Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh

Roll away the stone
Roll away the stone
If you could just move yours
I could get working on my own

Roll away the stone
(Roll away the stone)
Roll away the stone
(Roll away the stone)
If you could just move yours
I could get working on my own
(Roll away the stone)
I could get working on my own
(Roll away the stone)
Roll away the stone

Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
