Doomed lovers in a free fall
Together till they crash to the ground
I long for my sweet disappearer
As this avalanche of night
Slides down
Black haired angel by the bonfire
With alien eyes divine they flicker a moment
In the flames then follow the smoke
Into the sky
It's like losing a limb
This agonizing goodbye
My dreams of her are violent
All swirled in red
Like the storm in Jupiter's eye
All swirled in red
Like the storm in Jupiter's eye
