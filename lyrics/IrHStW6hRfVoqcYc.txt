I'm still frustrated from last night
Things happen in half-time, I'm sick of the bends
My panic research was no help
I sink into myself afraid of the fall that never ends

I wait but I'm too tired to play pretend
I suffocate until the end

No time for halfhearted goodbyes
I turn on the spotlight and flee from the scene
Cheap flights from Paris to Bangkok
I thought it was nonstop, can't sleep on the KLM again

I haunt the halls of medicine at night
Choking back the urge to fight

Her cat was clawing the floorboards
Just outside of our door the panic begins
I searched the whole damn apartment
From ceiling to carpet, no sign of the thing she used to own

As autumn turns its back on me again
I climb the walls for oxygen

My body aches, it heaves, it shakes
All somersaults through so called art
And I still don't know exactly who I am
I never will, amen

She whispers something in my ear
The message is unclear, she motions outside
I trail her closely from behind
She tries hard not to cry, she shakes underneath the pouring rain

I can't compete with all your damn ideas
And this isn't working out for you or me
The truth is I'm too tired to play pretend
This is goodbye, this is the end
