moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style, some day
oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
wherever you're going, I'm going your way

two drifters off to see the world
there's such a lot of world to see
we're after the same rainbow's end
it's just around the bend, my huckleberry friend
moon river and me
