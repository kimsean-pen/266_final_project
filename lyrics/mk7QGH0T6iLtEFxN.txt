Someone who is more that I am
I've seen nothing so full with blight's pain
Softly, I been waiting sunlight
Memories of the days when I was one
My sweet angel, stony face the ground
Sleeping demon, safe from everyone
Tell me, who is lonely as I am?
I've seen nothing so cruel as God's hand
Softly, I been waiting sunlight
Memories of the days when I was one
My sweet angel, stony face the ground
Sleeping demon, safe from everyone
My sweet angel, stony face the ground
Sleeping demon, safe from everyone
Tell me, who is lonely as I am?
I've seen nothing so cruel as God's hand
Softly, I been waiting sunlight
Memories of the days when I was one
My sweet angel, stony face the ground
Sleeping demon, safe from everyone
