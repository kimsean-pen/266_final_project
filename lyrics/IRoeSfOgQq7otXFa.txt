All of us girls
We're in and out of love
We're vulnerable
But we'll tell you that we're tough
Some of these guys
Never think that they'll get caught
Think that we're blind
But they're forgetting that we talk
If he never calls when he says he will
If he always talk you to keep it chill
If you see him out with another girl
Baby then you know he was never real
If he never want you to meet his friends
If he ain't tagging you on the gram
Take your heart and turn around while You still can
And tell him,tell him, tell him,tell him Igot somewhere else to be
And i don't,i don't, i don't, i don't
Lose my head for nobody
Yeah
You have to question
Is he loyal to me?
Well then he's probably they not
And you should probably leave
Yeah ooh ooh ooh
Yeah ooh ooh ooh
Yeah ooh ooh ooh
Yeah ooh ooh ooh
Says he's online
But he told you he's a sleep
You stay inside
Like he never wants you to be seen
Ain't got a job
No
Says he models on the side
Swear you're the one
But he's not the label type
If he never calls when he says he will
If he always tells you to keep it chill
If you see him out with another girl
Baby then you know he was never real
Hope you never let these pictures send
He'll only go show them to his friend
Take you heart and turn around while You still can
And tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him
i got somewhere else to be
And i don't,i don't, i don't, i don't
Lose my head for no body
Yeah, have to question
Is he loyal to me?
Well then he's probably they not
And you should probably leave
Yeah ooh ooh ooh
Yeah ooh ooh ooh
Yeah ooh ooh ooh
Yeah ooh ooh ooh
They're not, they're not, loyal to me
They're not, they're not, loyal to me
They're not, they're not, loyal to me
They're not, they'not loyal
And tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him
I got some where else to be
And i don't, i don't, i don't, I don't
Lose my head for nobody
