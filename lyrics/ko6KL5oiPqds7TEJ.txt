I was bitter but I'm fine now
I pull my head down from its dark cloud
It was easy enough but but
It was all too much

A hurricane lives in my bedroom
It keeps me up and awake for round two
And I just wanna sleep but
That's all too much

It's like a bad day in new shoes
A long weekend with curfews
Now I feel like that's all old news

I can't even count the times
I settled for these scribbled lines
Tell me won't you
Stay awake, stay awake for me
I'm over all the stale days
Captured I was stuck in place
Tell me won't you
Stay awake, stay awake for me
I'm thinking off the page and I can't sleep
I'm thinking off the page and I can't sleep

I miss the time when I thought I had it
From the hours I lost in traffic
I built these walls around me and
It's all too much

My influx of emotions got me feeling in slow motion
Like I'm saturated culminating
Like I'm all too much
Tell me is it all too much

It's like a bad day in new shoes
A long weekend with curfews
Now I feel like that's all old news

I can't even count the times
I settled for these scribbled lines
Tell me won't you
Stay awake, stay awake for me
I'm over all the stale days
Captured I was stuck in place
Tell me won't you
Stay awake, stay awake for me
I'm thinking off the page and I can't sleep
I'm thinking off the page and I can't sleep

A hurricane lives in my bedroom
It keeps me up and awake for round two
And I just wanna sleep but
That's all too much

I can't even count the times
I settled for these scribbled lines
Tell me won't you
Stay awake, stay awake for me
I'm over all the stale days
Captured I was stuck in place
Tell me won't you
Stay awake, stay awake for me
I'm thinking off the page and I can't sleep
I'm thinking off the page
