We had an apartment in the city
Me and Loretta liked living there
It's been years since the kids have grown
A lives of their own left us alone

John and Linda live in Omaha
And Joe is somewhere on the road
We lost Davy in the Korean war
I still don't know what for, don't matter anymore

Ya' know that old trees just grow stronger
Old rivers grow wilder every day
But old people just grow lonesome
Waiting for someone to say, "Hello in there, hello"

Me and Loretta, we don't talk much more
She sits and stares through the back door screen
All the news just repeats itself
Like some forgotten dream that we've both seen

Someday I'll go and call up Rudy
We worked together at the factory
What will I tell him if he asks, "What's new?"
"Nothing, what's with you? Nothing much to do"

Ya' know that old trees just grow stronger
Rivers grow wilder every day
But old people just grow lonesome
Waiting for someone to say, "Hello in there, hello"

So, if you're walking down the street sometime
And spot some hollow ancient eyes
Please don't just pass 'em by and stare
Like you didn't care, say, "Hello in there, hello"
Say, "Hello in there, hello"
