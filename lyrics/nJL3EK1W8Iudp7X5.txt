I meant what I said
You're too young to love me like you do
As those letters you penned
So heartfelt, so reverent
Only proved

Lovers come and go
The good ones always know
How they're getting home

I meant what I said
You're too sharp to get cut up by me

Lovers come and go
The good ones always know the difference
Between being casual or a casualty

Lovers come and go
The good ones are incapable of faking it
Stop faking it - I know that you can't sing
