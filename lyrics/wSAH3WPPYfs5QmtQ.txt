Think I'm gonna run when the torture man
Come from the London dungeon
Think I'm gonna run when the torture man
Come from the London dungeon

Hey, guess again
If you thought that we had come here to pretend, guess again
If you thought we wouldn't represent, guess again
If you thought we wouldn't represent to the end
To the very bitter end, to the very bitter end
If you thought that we had come here to pretend, guess again
If you thought we wouldn't represent, guess again
If you thought we wouldn't represent to the end
To the very bitter end, to the very bitter end

Try to divide us and we grow stronger
Can't fight us no longer
Man are too righteous, ain't going under
We'll take them down instead
Drop 'em on their head from the height of Mount Everest
We don't bow down to no terrorists
So why we gonna kneel for the politicians
When we see 'em going on so treacherous
Hey, them man they be lying, they be fucking with our future
From all positions like they reading Kama Sutra
Breaking out the EU like they in a Mini Cooper
Yeah

Guess again
If you thought that we had come here to pretend, guess again
If you thought we wouldn't represent, guess again
If you thought we wouldn't represent to the end
To the very bitter end, to the very bitter end
If you thought that we had come here to pretend, guess again
If you thought we wouldn't represent, guess again
If you thought we wouldn't represent to the end
To the very bitter end

Ain't scared of no tyrants
They can't control us, threaten us with violence
Man dem will roll up, hear the sound of sirens
Then we see the road blocks
Think that's gonna change things, boy?
Boys in blue see black and white, don't see no other colour
But they only shoot at one more than they do the other
If you think that people only riot in the summer
Guess again, guess again, guess again-gain-gain
Don't you know what happen when you back man in a corner
Lash out, don't act like we didn't warn ya
Lash out, you man are acting out of order
Murder man for nothing and the government support ya
Woah

Guess again
If you thought that we had come here to pretend, guess again
If you thought we wouldn't represent, guess again
If you thought we wouldn't represent to the end
To the very bitter end, to the very bitter end
If you thought that we had come here to pretend, guess again
If you thought we wouldn't represent, guess again
If you thought we wouldn't represent to the end
To the very bitter end, to the very bitter end

Right wing fundamentalists, oh
We don't like your rhetoric, no
You man are fucking menaces
But we'll stay here and settle this
If you think we're playing
Then you don't know who you're messing with
If you think this is a game
Guess again, guess again, guess again-gain-gain
If you think this is a game
Guess again, guess again, guess again-gain

Think I'm gonna run when the torture man
Come from the London dungeon
Think I'm gonna run when the torture man
Come from the London dungeon

Guess again
If you thought that I had come here to pretend, guess again
If you thought I wouldn't represent, guess again
If you thought I wouldn't represent my ends
To the very bitter end, to the very bitter end
If you thought that I had come here to pretend, guess again
If you thought I wouldn't represent, guess again
If you thought I wouldn't represent my ends
To the very bitter end, to the very bitter end

Think I'm gonna run when the torture man
Come from the London dungeon
Think I'm gonna run when the torture man
Come from the London dungeon
