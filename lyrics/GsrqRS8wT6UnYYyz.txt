You have turned into a prayer
I can feel I'm almost there
Closer closer to the top
Looking down is quite a drop
Let me have it all
Let me have it all
Let me have it all
Let me have it all

You set up a barrier
Don't you know I'd marry ya
Can't explain how you make me feel
Don't you know I'm feeling real
Make me feel like a kang
Everythang is everythang

Let me have it all
Let me have it all
Let me have it all
Let me have it all

You've turned into a prayer
I can feel you almost there
Closer closer to the top
Looking down is quite a drop
Just to be near you is to be
Let me have the rest of me
You set up a barrier
Don't you know I'd marry ya
Can't explain how you make me feel
Don't you know I'm feeling real
