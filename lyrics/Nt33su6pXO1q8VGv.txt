Don't you know, know, know
It's a violation

I still hear you saying
Such a perfect, perfect night
No, no, no fight all temptation

Well in a black hearted alley fight
I'm screaming "Take me to the heights tonight"
Take me to the top
Take me to the top
Take me to the top

Take me to the top
Take me to the top
Take me to the top
Take me to the top

Take me to the top
Take me to the top

(",...,")
Too many times victim accusation
No you don't have to take it like that
A sheer sheer heart attack
No, no, no, no realization

Ooh I never had a way with you
But I still hear you saying
Take me to the top
Take me to the top

Take me to the top
Take me to the top
Take me to the top
Take me to the top

Take me to the top
Take me to the top
Take me to the top
(",...,")

Take me to the top
To the top
And throw me off
Take me to the top

To the top
And throw me off
Take me to the top
To the top and throw me off
Take me to the top
To the top and throw me off
Take me to the top
To the top
And throw me off
Take me to the top
To the top
And throw me off
Take me to the top
To the top
And throw me off
Take me to the top
To the top
And throw me off
Take me to the top
