It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

The wait is ova, the wait is ova
The wait is ova, the wait is ova
The wait is ova, the wait is ova
The wait is ova, the wait is ova

I pitch with a grenade
Swing away if you're feeling brave
There's so much power in my name
If you pop off in your seat
Steady I'm gonna do the wave

I'm such a fucking lady
You don't have to be so afraid
Cause I got room up on my team
You can play but hold

(Up) It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your

(Turn) It's getting crowded over here, but babe (the wait is ova)
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win (the wait is ova)

Fumble, don't you fumble that's a flag on the play
Babe if you don't wanna then you don't have to wait
But together we gon' be taking over

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

So you don't wanna wait
I hate to hear that's such a shame
Cause if you play it sideways
Ain't no time out in my game
They already underway

I know you want to win
And you wish I would let you in
Get in line over here
You can play but hold

(Up) It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your

(Turn) It's getting crowded over here, but babe (the wait is ova)
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win (the wait is ova)

Fumble, don't you fumble that's a flag on the play
Babe if you don't wanna then you don't have to wait
But together we gon' be taking over

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

Baby put the work in like a champion
But the crowd is screaming with their hands way up
Couldn't be with no one else
You're the only way I win

Baby got the whole world standing up
Damn I'm glad I picked ya took a chance on love
Baby love

The time is now, and now, the wait is ova

The wait is ova, the wait is ova
The wait is ova, the wait is ova (just wait your turn)
The wait is ova, the wait is ova
The wait is ova, the wait is ova (just wait your)

(Turn) It's getting crowded over here, but babe (the wait is ova)
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win (the wait is ova)

Fumble, don't you fumble that's a flag on the play
Babe if you don't wanna then you don't have to wait
But together we gon' be taking over

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

(Just wait your turn) The wait is ova, the wait is ova
The wait is ova, the wait is ova
