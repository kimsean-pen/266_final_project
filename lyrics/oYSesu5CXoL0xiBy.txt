Danny is lonely, 'cause Mary's in India now
She said she'd call but that was three weeks ago
She left all her things, well, her books and her letters from him
But as the sun rises on Mary, it sets on him

And just dance, and just drink
And just say the things I'll probably never get a chance to say

Danny is not eating, he's drinking and sleeping in
I saw him last night at the party, he's definitely thin
He says he's happy, he looked pretty good but I think
That as the sun rises on Mary, it sets on him

And just dance and just drink
And just say the things I'll probably never get a chance to say

Danny came over last night and I cooked for him
He talked about you, Mary, and how much we loved you still
He told me he's packed up you books and letters and things
As the sun sets on Mary, its rising on him

And we danced, and we drank
And I've seen something you probably never got a chance to see

Don't worry Mary, 'cause I'm taking care of Danny
And he's taking care of me
