We're nothing like you
A wall in black
We're nothing like you
And you don't get who we are

We're nothing like you
We dare the flow
We're nothing like you
And you don't know who we are

In a land of seals and sorrow
We kept waiting for the spark
So hail your kings and hail your queens
We're different, we're the children of the dark!

We're nothing like you
We're true and free
We're nothing like you
But you can't see who we are

We're nothing like you
And all the rest
We're nothing like you
And you won't guess who we are

In a land of hate and horror
We set an exclamation mark
So hail your kings and hail your queens
We're rigid, we're the children of the dark!

For a new beginning
For a turnaround
Our heads are spinning
And we won't calm down
We're a wall in motion
Oh, a change is now walk in the park
What comes around
Goes around
You better watch out
We're the children of the dark!

We're nothing like you, we're true and free
We're nothing like you but you can't see
We're nothing like you and all the rest
We're nothing like you
We're the children of the dark!
