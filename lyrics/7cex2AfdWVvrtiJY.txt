It doesn't take much to keep holding someone's hand
You have to keep your eyes open as wide as you can
You never know what could come along...

Sometimes people think that they are so in love
When it's the first person that they have ever been with
I think it's so stupid
so stupid

You have to keep your eyes open
You'll never know if she's right
if she's right

It's so amazing how people can be held down
By just one person that doesn't even care what they think
I know it's so stupid
so stupid

You have to keep your eyes open
You'll never know if she's right
if she's right

You have to keep your eyes open
You'll never know if she's right
if she's right
