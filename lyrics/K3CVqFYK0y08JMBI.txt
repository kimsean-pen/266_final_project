Are you hearing about me?
How you dealing without me?
Hello
Did you keep all the records?
Do they sound good without me?
Mellow
Heard you got a new lady, is she driving you crazy?
Too bad
Did you keep the apartment?
Does she like what we started?
So glad

Did you hear about me? I got off the ground
I stood up when you left and, baby, look at me now
Look at me now, yeah
Did you hear about me? I'm making a name
I got a little money just playing the game
Look at me now, oh, look at me
Did you see me driving with the windows down?
You said I'd never do it, well, I figured it out
Oh, look at me now

Did you hear about me? You pushed me around
But now I'm pushing paper, baby, look at me now
Look at me now, yeah
Did you hear about me? You thought I'd give in
You try to hurt me, but you'll never do it again
Look at me now, oh, look at me
Did you hear about me? I got a new love
Somebody I can count on, a love I can trust
Oh, look at me now, oh, look at me
Did you hear about me? I'm living the dream
Everything is better since you walked out one me
Look at me now, oh, look at me
Why did you leave me? Didn't you care?
Didn't you love me? Don't you wish I was there?
Oh, baby, please look at me now
