You could probably say I'm difficult
I probably talk too much
I over-analyze and over-think things
Yes it's a nasty crutch
I'm usually only waiting for you to stop talking
So that I can
Concerning two-way streets I have to say
That I am not a fan

But I am the greatest motherfucker
That you're ever gonna meet
From the top of my head
Down to the tips of the toes on my feet
So go ahead and love me while it's still a crime
And don't forget you could be laughing
Sixty five percent more of the time
You could be laughing
Sixty five percent more of the time

Half of the time I think I'm in some movie
I play the underdog of course
I wonder who'll they'll get to play me, maybe
They could dig up Richard Burton's corpse
I am not who you think I am
I am quite angry which I barely can conceal
You think I hate myself, it's you I hate
Because you have the nerve to make me feel

But I am the greatest motherfucker
That you're ever gonna meet
From the top of my head
Down to the tips of the toes on my feet
So go ahead and love me while it's still a crime
And don't forget you could be laughing
Sixty five percent more of the time
You could be laughing
Sixty five percent more of the time

I should've practiced my scales
I should not be attracted to males
But you said that I should learn to love myself
Well, make up your mind, Dr. Frankenstein

I am the greatest motherfucker
That you're ever gonna meet
From the top of my head
Down to the tips of the toes on my feet
So go ahead and love me while it's still a crime
And don't forget you could be laughing
Sixty five percent more of the time
You could be laughing
Sixty five percent more of the time
'Cause I am the greatest motherfucker
That you're ever gonna meet
From the top of my head
Down to the tips of the toes on my feet
So go ahead and love me while it's still a crime
And don't forget you could be laughing
Sixty five percent more of the time
You could be laughing
Sixty three percent more of the time
You could be laughing
Twenty five percent more of the time
