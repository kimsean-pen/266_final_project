I don't hang around that place no more
I'm tired of wearing circles in the floor
And I don't carry myself very well
I've gotten so much braver, can you tell

I'm happy, can't you see
I'm alright, but I miss you, Amber Lee

And I line my secrets up all one by one
I put 'em all away when I was done
And I would really love to hear your voice sometime
To close a little distance in my mind

I'm happy, can't you see
I'm alright, but I miss you, Amber Lee

I believe

Where have you been all these years
How could you just disappear
And when did you stop missing me

I'm happy, can't you see
I'm alright, but I miss you, Amber Lee
I'm alright, but I miss you, Amber Lee
