You went down in the very first round
Sitting ringside in a tiny town
Knock out, knock out
First round, first round

Ooh, when you call
You will call the loudest
Oh, when you fall
You will fall the hardest

This could be our very last stand
The monitor and the Merrimac
Too bad, too bad
You're ironclad, ironclad

Ooh, when you call
You will call the loudest
Oh, when you fall
You will fall the hardest

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

What would you kill?
What would you kill?
What would you kill?

To make a heart stand still?
A heart stand still?
A heart stand still?

What would you pay?
What would you pay?
What would you pay?

To make the hate go away?
The hate go away?
The hate go away?

Ooh, when you call
You will call the loudest
Oh, when you fall
You will fall the hardest

Why battle-cry, dry your eyes
No one can hear you
Once iron made heart or spade
No one can steal you
