I can make love feel just like heaven (oh)
I can be a little devil in bed and (oh)
Even clean and cook your breakfast, but I'm not perfect, I
I can take off when need your time (oh)
I can cheer lead you for on the sideline (oh)
Whisper in your ear so divine, but I'm not perfect, I
I hope you can forgive me baby, for all the mistakes I've made
Be patient with me, baby, I'm just tryin' to make my way
I'm not a superhero; sorry, I couldn't save the day
Believe me when I say

That I'm sorry, I couldn't wear your halo, halo, halo, halo
Sorry, I couldn't be your angel, angel, angel, angel
I'm sorry, I couldn't wear your halo, halo, halo, halo
Sorry, I didn't stroke your ego, ego, ego, oh no
I was with him but I guess I wasn't able
I'm sorry, I couldn't wear your halo... Halo, halo
I know how to put your mind at ease (oh)
And I can dress you for all four seasons (oh)
Surprise you for no reason, but I'm not perfect, no
I'm on my knees and pray for our love (oh)
Promise not to let anything come between us (oh)
Could you let us fall a part all because I'm not perfect, I
Hope you can forgive me baby, for all the mistakes I've made
Be patient with me, baby, I'm just tryin' to make my way
I'm not a superhero; sorry, I couldn't save the day

Believe me when I say

That I'm sorry, I couldn't wear your halo, halo, halo, halo
Sorry, I couldn't be your angel, angel, angel, angel
I'm sorry, I couldn't wear your halo, halo, halo, halo
Sorry, I didn't stroke your ego, ego, ego, oh no
I was with him but I guess I wasn't able
I'm sorry, I couldn't wear your halo... Halo, halo
Now it's like you never knew my heart, I swear sometimes you are
So hard on me 'cause I'm not everything, that you want me to be
I'm so sorry, I didn't want you to see me this way

I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to fall from grace
I didn't mean to fall from grace

That I'm sorry, I couldn't wear your halo, halo, halo, halo
Sorry, I couldn't be your angel, angel, angel, angel
I'm sorry, I couldn't wear your halo, halo, halo, halo
Sorry, I didn't stroke your ego, ego, ego, oh no
I was with him but I guess I wasn't able
I'm sorry, I couldn't wear your halo... Halo, halo
