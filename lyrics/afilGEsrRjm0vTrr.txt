It doesnt matter who you are
Or what youre gonna be
People from all walks of life
You gotta have diversity
Were all in this together
And together we shall be
You gotta be a friendly neighbor
If youre gonna live next to me
Were all

Livin on the same side
Same side of town
Walkin down the same streets
The streets that are all around

You could be my brother
Or you could be my friend
But dont turn your back on me
Cause well be here til the end
Yeah, were all in this together
And we all have that dream
To live in perfect harmony
Like a family thats the scene
Yeah, were all...

Livin on the same side
Same side of town
Walkin down the same streets
The streets that are all around
Livin on the same side
Same side of town
Shufflin to the same beat
The beat thats all around

Stumblin down on d.p., keggers all around,
Laughin at the police as they try to take us down
Hangin with each other, yeah hangin with our bros
We all love one another, from our heads down to our toes
