Baltimore

Nobody got in nobody's way
So eye guess u could say
It was a good day

At least a little better than the day in Baltimore
Does anybody hear us pray?
4 Michael Brown or Freddie Gray
Peace is more than the absence of war
Absence of
R we gonna c another bloody day?
We're tired of cryin' & people dyin'
Let's all take the guns away

Absence of warâ€”U and Me
Maybe we can finally say
Enuff is enuff it's time 4 love

It's time 2 hear
It's time 2 hear the guitar play
Guitar play, Baltimore
Ever more

If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace
If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace
If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace
If there ain't no justice then there ain't no peace
