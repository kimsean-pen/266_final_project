I keep lookin' for ya
My little love
I'm here to say
How I'm feeling
I'm walkin' out the door with
A little love
To give away
But just for you my darlin'

It's really nice to meet you
My little love
We're here today
In the moment
And nothing can compete with
A little love
It's quite the way
To spend the night my darlin'

I moved to California
My little love
To get away
From the cold
But now I feel it every morning
Our little love
Has gone astray
And I'll miss you my darlin'
