Don't you know you're queen
Yet even flower bloom at my feet
Don't you know you're queen
Cracked, peeling
Riddled with disease
Don't you know me

No family is safe
When I sashay

Don't you know you're queen
Gleaning, wrapped in golden leaves
Don't you know me
Rank, ragged
Skin sewn on sheets
Case in the barracks
For an ass to break and harness into the fold
Mary

No family is safe
When I sashay
