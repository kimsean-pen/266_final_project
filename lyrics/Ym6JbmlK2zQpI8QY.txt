Oh, why are we awaiting so long I'm suffocating
Oh, why are we awaiting so long I'm suffocating
Boy it's now or never, time we got together

Been a long time coming, now I need that loving
I like the way you tease me, let's just make this easy
Put me in control, we can switch roles and...
I'll take the lead, you're so far behind me
You know what I need, I'm not gonna stop
Whatever the weather we gon' be better together
So what's up, babe, what about us
'Cause I've been watching and waiting

Why don't you give it and take it
So what's up, babe, what about us
What you're doing to my head (na, na, na, na, na)
Should be here with me instead (na, na, na, na, na)

What about those words you said (na, na, na, na, na)
What about us, what about u-u-u-u-u-us
Oh, why are we awaiting so long I'm suffocating
Oh, why are we awaiting so long I'm suffocating
I love to hear you whisper, take it take ir lower
Don't been afraid to show-a what you freakin' do

'Cause we can do it nightly, you get me excited
Now it's my turn to, yes it's my turn
So give it to me, why are we waiting
You know what I need and I'm not gonna stop

Whatever the weather we gon' be better together
So what's up, babe, what about us

'Cause I've been watching and waiting
Why don't you give it and take it
So what's up, babe, what about us
What you're doing to my head (na, na, na, na, na)
Should be with me instead (na, na, na, na, na)
What about those words you said (na, na, na, na, na)

What about us, what about u-u-u-u-u-us
What about u-u-u-u-u-us

What about u-u-u-u-u-us
'Cause you've been watching me, watching me yeah wherever I go
'Cause you're a criminal, criminal yeah deep down to the core
I know that you ain't seen, you ain't seen nothing like this before
And you know, like I know, you should be giving it up!
Whatever the weather we gon' be better together

So what's up, babe, what about us
'Cause I've been watching and waiting
Why don't you give it and take it
So what's up, babe, what about us
What you're doing to my head (na, na, na, na, na)
Should be with me instead (na, na, na, na, na)
What about those words you said (na, na, na, na, na)
What about us, what about u-u-u-u-u-us
Let me take the lead (na, na, na, na, na)
You know what I need (na, na, na, na, na)
Put my mind at ease (na, na, na, na, na)
And tell me what about us, what about us
