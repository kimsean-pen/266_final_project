I build a fire in the snow
Warm our bodies from the cold
And you said
If we never try
We'll never know
You have to sow the seed
And watch it grow

Everywhere I go, all I ever see
Are all the little ways that used to be
People that I know only ever speak
Like everythin' is headin' for catastrophe
There's nothing I could do, I don't get to choose
Even if I could rewrite the history
It's clear to see
That I'd still be

Loving you
Loving you

This is bound to leave a mark
But I'll be proud to wear the scars
They tell a rich tale of disaster
About a love and what came after
I'll be frozen like a storm
Think we should take the long way home

Everywhere I go, all I ever see
Are all the little ways that used to be
People that I know only ever speak
Like everything is headin' for catastrophe
There's nothing I could do, I don't get to choose
Even if I could rewrite the history
It's clear to see
That I'd still be

Loving you
Loving you
Loving you
Loving you
