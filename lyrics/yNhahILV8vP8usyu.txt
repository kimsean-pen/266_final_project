So sweet
She's original
Never giving you what you want
So sweet
For a renegade
For a renegade
For a renegade ahhh
You're lying to me, Debbie
I know that you are
I see it written on your face
I know I can do much better
But I'm here in your car
'Cause no one makes me feel the same way
And I'll blame it on you
I'll blame it on you
I'll blame it on you
I'll blame it on you
I'll blame it on you
I'll blame it on you
Her wheels
Beating up the dust
Speeding out of L.A.
Smoke screen
And the radio
Where'd you get it from?
She won't say
You're lying to me, Debbie
I know that you are
I see it written on your face
I know I can do much better
But I'm here in your car
'Cause no one makes me feel the same way
And I'll blame it on you
I'll blame it on you
I'll blame it on you
I'll blame it on you
I'll blame it on you
I'll blame it on you
Oh Debbie
Would you give me a (?)
This always happens when I listen to you
You know I was only doing what you told me to do
Oh Debbie
Would you give me a (?)
You
I'll blame it on you
I'll blame it on you
I'll blame it on you
I'll blame it on you
I'll blame it on you
You're lying to me, Debbie
Lying to me, Debbie
Lying to me, blame it on you
Hey, ey, ey
Lying to me, Debbie
Lying to me, Debbie
Lying, yeah I blame it on you
