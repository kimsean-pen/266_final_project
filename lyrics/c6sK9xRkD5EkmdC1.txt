she was all alone
she looked round and around
forever searching
incessant drudgery
but she had that someone wrapped up in a box
sticking pins and needles through the tiny cracks

she had someone she owned
and it's hard to confess
i was that someone
and she could care less

she's got (she's got)
a cause (she thinks she has)
a cause

okay...

least i have my address
in her stranglehold
lived my life around her
and i lived my life as i was told
had me coming and going and coming and going like a toy
turned me from a man into a sniveling little boy

she's got (she's got)
a cause (she thinks she has)
