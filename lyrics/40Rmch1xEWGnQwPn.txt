Ender to an eve reaches down a hand
Can't remember when we last lost ourselves

Take off, gonna get ours
Anything goes as long as joy's the plan

Every now and then, more than that admit

Take it off, writ in the sky
Anyways, I would give you all I have

And it's one more tip with a feathered cap
One more trip to the habitat
One more whip of a cheeky slap
One more dip in the natural sap
That's that

It's a wheel (It's a wheel)
It's a wheel (It's a wheel)
It's a wheel (It's a wheel)
It's a wheel (It's a wheel)
It's a wheel (It's a wheel)
It's a wheel (It's a wheel)
It's a wheel (It's a wheel)
It's a wheel (It's a wheel)
