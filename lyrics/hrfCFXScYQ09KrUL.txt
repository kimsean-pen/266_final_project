Hell, fear me
I am the one that will bring you down
And when you fall, feel me
You'll see my face on
The battleground

Hell, fear me
I am the one that will bring you down
And when you fall, feel me
You'll see my face on
The battleground

Let my name be feared at the gates of hell, as I exalt the Savior
The One that died to buy my victory
And gave me a new name
Let my name be feared at the gates of hell, as I exalt the Savior
In the name of the Holy One of God
I will cast you down at the foot of the cross He hung from
I will stand behind my Savior
As He burns your kingdom down
And I will see you on your knees before the King of Kings
You will lose your throne to the chosen ones
The chosen ones will rise

Tear it to the ground!
This is the army we've been waiting for
Tear it to the ground!
We will storm the gates of hell and we will...
Tear it to the ground!
We stand behind the one that conquered death
Tear it to the ground!
And we will stand when there is nothing left
Tear it to the ground!
Tear it to the ground!

Justice!
Justice!
Justice!
God, bring justice!
Justice!
We will come against the bondage of hell
Justice!
And we will take back what's taken from us
Justice!
This is our right as heirs to dominion
God, bring justice!

This war will end

I am the one that will bring you down
And when you fall, feel me
You'll see my face on the battleground

Hell, fear me
I am the one that will bring you down
And when you fall, feel me
You'll see my face on the battleground
