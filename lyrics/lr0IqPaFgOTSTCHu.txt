You are the moonlight in the sky that I'm persuing
You are the reason for what I'm doing
You are the crystal that keeps me from ruin
You are the movement
You're the true north phoning back home
You are the constant, my constellation
You're the steady hand of a ticking clocking that I've come to rely on

Oh it's so clear
Come a little closer all my love is right here
I just want to hear you whispering you still trust
You're the only thing that I have ever been sure of
I just wanna be with you
I promise I won't let you down
Honey it's so clear now

You are the full winds
You're the catalyst of high hopes
You are the beauty
The sparks revivial
You're the oxygen inside these lungs that's giving life to my bones

Oh it's so clear
Come a little closer all my love is right here
I just want to hear you whispering you still trust
You're the only thing that I have ever been sure of
I just wanna be with you
I promise I won't let you down
Honey it's so clear now

Oh it's so clear
Come a little closer all my love is right here
I just want to hear you whispering you still trust
You're the only thing that I have ever been sure of
I just wanna be with you
I promise I, I won't let you down
Honey it's so clear now
Honey it's so clear now
It's so clear now

I promise I won't let you done
Honey it's so clear now
Honey it's so clear now
Honey it's so clear now

It feels like heaven is coming down
It's right here with me
It's all around
Once was so lost, but I am found
When I'm with you
No ones' watching
The way you move
Body's dancing under the moon
You always know just what to do
When I'm with you
When I'm with you

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
