(Whoa-oh-oah,
Whoa-oh-oah)
Well I tried to fake it,
Baby I tried to break it,
But that's some kind of spell you got over me.
You're a heavenly vision,
Gonna make it my mission,
Do whatever it takes to get you with me.
Everywhere I go,
Yeah, no one else I know,
Shines as bright as you in my telescope.
I tried to let it fade,
But I can't get away,
I really hope you're listening, 'cause I never thought I would say-ay-ay.
I can't help myself from falling in love,
From falling in love with you yeah-yea
I can't help myself,
From taking the drug,
From taking the drug
It's you, yeah-yea.
It happens every time,
Can't get you off my mind,
And anybody else,
Better wait in line.
I can't help myself,
From falling in love,
From falling in love
With you yeah-yea.
Every time you come calling,
Didn't think I'd be falling,
Never thought It'd be you I would always need.
Love was something to run from,
I was always the last one,
That everyone thought would be in this dream.
Everywhere I go,
Yeah, no one else I know,
Shines as bright as you in my telescope.
I tried to let it fade,
But I can't get away,
I really hope you're listening, 'cause I never thought I would say-ay-ay.
I can't help myself from falling in love,
From falling in love with you yeah-yea
I can't help myself,
From taking the drug,
From taking the drug
It's you, yeah-yea.
It happens every time,
Can't get you off my mind,
And anybody else,
Better wait in line.
I can't help myself,
From falling in love,
From falling in love
With you yeah-yea.
They told me "Son, you'll be addicted."
You stole a kiss,
And now I see it.
You're in my veins,
And I can feel it,
Taking over me-e-e.
I can't help myself,
From falling in love,
From falling in love
With you yeah-yea.
I can't help myself,
From taking the drug,
From taking the drug
It's you, yeah-yea.
It happens every time,
Can't get you off my mind,
And anybody else,
Better wait in line.
I can't help myself,
From falling in love,
From falling in love
With you yeah-yea.
