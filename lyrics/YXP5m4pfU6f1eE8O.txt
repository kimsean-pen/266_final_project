Goin' through the Matrix
Red and blue pills, black shades, that's the basics
I feel it when they're eyein'
That's why I move low, get the codes, never mind 'em (Yeah)
I'm goin' through the Matrix
Red and blue pills, black shades, that's the basics
I feel it when they're eyein'
That's why I move low, get the codes, never mind 'em

I'm lookin' at the signs and they start showin'
Green numbers fallin' down in a row
I'm lookin' at the time, like, Where's it going?
Look 'em in their eyes so they all know

I wonder why, oh why, I always get this feelin'
They show me what I like but it's not appealin'
I'm workin' with no loan, tryna break a million
And when I'm in the zone this is what I tell 'em

I'm goin' through the Matrix
Red and blue pills, black shades, that's the basics
I feel it when they're eyein'
That's why I move low, get the codes, never mind 'em (Yeah)
I'm goin' through the Matrix

I found a Trinity out in Trinidad
Put me in a trance when she throw it back
It's not about the bag, it's how you make it last
I never bent down when they threw the cash

I wonder why, oh why, I always get this feelin'
They show me what I like but it's not appealin'
I'm workin' with no loan, tryna break a million
And when I'm in the zone this is what I tell 'em
