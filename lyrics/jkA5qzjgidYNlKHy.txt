Lock eyes like we're staring down the barrel of a shotgun
Appear so quickly
Leave as swiftly as you came
Sometimes I wish I had the measure of a wise man
But I set the mood, plant the tomb and bury all the bones within
It sure is something when we all catch fire
Bodies burning like the sunrise

Stay with me, I'll show you paradise
It feels so right
Give me that peace of mind and I'll give you everything
Just know it feels so good that I could die and be alright

Alive
We breathe when everthing is as it seems
But is there something much more?
Underneath the sheets, beneath the skin
There's a beauty waiting to be adored
We're cradled in the thick of it, but too ignorant to give a shit
We set the mood, we plant the tomb and bury all the bones within
Don't keep me hanging from the mouth
It sure is something when we all catch fire
Bodies burning like the sunrise

Stay with me, I'll show you paradise
It feels so right
Give me that peace of mind and I'll give you everything
Just know it feels so good that I could die and join the stars
Give me that peace of mind and I'll give you everything
Stay with me, I'll show you paradise
It feels so right

We exsist in this moment only to fly
Just stay with me
Twisting love as we hold it on the inside
Just stay with me

It sure is something when we all catch fire
Bodies burning like the sunrise

Stay with me, I'll show you paradise
It feels so right
Give me that peace of mind and I'll give you everything
Just know it feels so good that I could die and join the stars
Give me that peace of mind and I'll give you everything
Stay with me, I'll show you paradise
It feels so right!
