Are you ready? Ha

It's time for me to take it, I'm the boss right now
Not gonna fake it, not when you go down
'Cause this is my game, and you better come to play

I used to hold my freak back, now I'm letting go
I make my own choice, bitch, I run this show
So leave the lights on, no, you can't make me behave

So you say I'm complicated
That I must be outta my mind
But you've had me underrated
Rated, rated

What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident?
What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident?

It's time to get the chains out, is your tongue tied up?
'Cause this is my ground, and I'm dangerous
And you can get off, but it's all 'bout me tonight (tonight)

So you say I'm complicated
That I must be outta my mind
But you've had me underrated
Rated, rated

What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident?
What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident?

What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident?
What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident?

So you say I'm complicated
But you've had me underrated

What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident?
What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident?

What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident?
What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident?
