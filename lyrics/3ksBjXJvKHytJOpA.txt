No, never again will your walls
Be left abandoned by these hands
No, never again will I scale
The sleeping tower where your heart lays

Now, here we are my dear, this is where
You're walking out the way you came in

No, never again will you draw down
Your bridge to let the horses in
Dead or alive, the captives I thought I had freed
Made their bed at night to haunt me with their

Now, here we are my dear, this is where
You're walking out the way you came in
Oh, I came to let you try once again
It's the end

No, never again
No, never again
