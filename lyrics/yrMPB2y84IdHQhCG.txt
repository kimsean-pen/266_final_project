Laid back, laid back
Laid back, we'll give you laid back
Laid back, laid back
Laid back, I'll give you laid back
Over and over, and over, and over, and over
Like a monkey with a miniature symbol

The joy of repetition really is in you
Under and under, and under, and under, and under
The smell of repetition really is on you
And when you feel this way, I'm really with you
Laid back, laid back
Laid back, I'll give you laid back

Over and over, and over, and over, and over
Like a monkey with a miniature symbol
The joy of repetition really is in you

Under and under, and under, and under, and under
The smell of repetition really is on you
And when you leave it this way, I really am with you

I started thinking about what I to have to do

(Tell you)
I got to thinking that I mean just what you do
(Tell you)
I started thinking all you know, I to have to do
(Tell you, tell you, tell you, tell you)
I started thinking about what I to have to do
(Tell you)

I got to thinking that I mean just what you do
(Tell you)
I started thinking all you know, I to have to do
(Tell you, tell you, tell you, tell you)
Over and over, and over, and over, and over
Like a monkey with a miniature symbol
The joy of repetition really is in you
Under and under, and under, and under, and under

The smell of repetition really is on you
And when you leave it this way, I really am with you
