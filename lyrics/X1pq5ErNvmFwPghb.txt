No one knows the pain
No one sees what I see in you
No one feels the same
No one sees myself like you do

Watch the sun now
Had a likkle beef but it's done now (It's done)
I just need a drink and a rub down
When my team's in the place, it's shut down (Down)
I'ma ride on a wave 'til it's sundown (Wave it)
Peng ting, looking like a touchdown (Gorg)
All my haters looking vexed 'cause I'm up now (Vexed)
I went up, then my kettle got bust down (Bling, blow)

(I'm a rock-) I'm a rock star (Psych out)
I get the yattie love like a pop star (Woo)
And when I'm in my ends I'm a block star
Wait everybody run from the cop car (Woo-woo)
And I dunno about sober (I don't)
I'm just a block boy sitting in a Rover (21)
I got my friends and my fam on my shoulder (My fam)
I been cold but my money got me colder
Said I'm a rock star (Yeah)
I get the yattie love like a pop star (Uh)
And when I'm in my ends I'm a block star (True)
Wait everybody run from the cop car (Woo-woo)
And I dunno about sober (I don't)
I'm just a block boy sitting in a Rover (I swear)
I got my friends and my fam on my shoulder (On my back)
I been cold but my money got me colder
