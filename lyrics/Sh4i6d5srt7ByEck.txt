Saw you there
You started walking away
You see all those lights
You left a taste in my mouth

And I don't know why
We started falling apart
So reach my mind
With your distopian hands??

And I'm still there

And I don't know why
We started falling apart
Saw you change
And I am taking a break

And I'm still there

Saw you there
You started waking away
You see all those lights
You left a taste in my mouth

And I'm still there
Stading in there

You started walking away
To reach my mind
With your distopian hands??
And I'm still there

Saw you there
You started waling away
You see all those lights
