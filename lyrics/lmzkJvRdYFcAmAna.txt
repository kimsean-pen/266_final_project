I'll run out
(Good luck always does)
Better to expect it
It's around
(Coming for you now)
Just to slow you down
But is there a way out?

Hole in my head
Plane crash in bed
Following me
Becoming me

Light is a cause and concern
Show me the way out
Is there a door to walk through?
Where is the way out?
Where is the way out?

Waiting for a while
Let me feel I'm fine
Only to betray me still...
Waiting for a while
Let me feel I'm fine
Only to betray me still...

Hole in my head
Plane crash in bed
Following me
Becoming me

Hole in my head
Plane crash in bed
Following me
Becoming me
