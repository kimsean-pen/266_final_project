I talk when I'm nervous
I talk all the time
I'm a walking second guess
with a mouth like a fault line
I'm a glutton for punishment
when I'm just being honest
but I'm just being honest
I wish I had the means to
stop killing things that I'll never get to meet
I've got issues with control
I can't control anything
I'm afraid I'm afraid
of making any sounds
when anyone's around
I'm afraid I'm afraid
of making any sounds
when anyone's around
I'm afraid I'm afraid
of making any sounds
