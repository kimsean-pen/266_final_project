I've been wasting my time
I've been losing my mind
I've been running races
Still don't know what I've been chasing

But my eyes that can see
Bluer skies that wait for me
And I'm on my way

Time for me to fly
Time for me to soar
Time for me to open up my heart
And knock on Heaven's door

Time for me to live
It's time for me to sing
Time for me to lay down all my worries
And I'll spread my wings

Time for me to fly

The earth can be a heavy ride
When those clouds have been your eyes
But I feel a calling
I will rise, I won't be falling

And I'll escape the gravity
And I'll reach my destiny
And I'll fly away

It's time for me to fly
Time for me to soar
Time for me to open up my heart
And knock on Heaven's door

Time for me to live
It's time for me to sing
Time for me to lay down all my worries
And I'll spread my wings

Time for me to fly
Time for me to fly

The gates of heaven will open wide
I will be, I will rise
There won't be compromise
As I take to the open skies

One, two, three, four

Time for me to fly
Time for me to soar
Time for me to open up my heart
And knock on Heaven's door

Time for me to live
It's time for me to sing
Time for me to lay down all my worries
And I'll spread my wings

I will fly away, I will fly away
I will fly away, I will fly away
I will fly away, I will fly away

It's time for me to fly
Time for me to soar
Time for me to open up my heart
And knock on Heaven's door

Time for me to live
It's time for me to sing
Time for me to lay down all my worries
And I'll spread my wings

Time for me to fly
