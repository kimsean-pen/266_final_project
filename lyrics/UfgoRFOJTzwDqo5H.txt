I was thinking about parking the other night
We was out on a back road
Me and my baby was just getting right
All our systems on overload
Radio blasting in the front seat
Turning out the music fine
We was snuggled up in the back seat
Making up for lost time

Steamy windows
Zero visibility
Steamy windows
Coming from the body heat

You can wine and dine with a man all night
With good intent
But there is something about
a confrontation on a back road
Breaks down the defense

Steamy windows
Zero visibility
Steamy windows
Coming from the body heat

Steamy windows
Ain't nobody can see
Steamy windows
Coming from the body heat

(solo)

There's a sound outside the front door
And I know that's just the wind
And it makes him snuggle up
just a little bit closer
And start things happening again

Steamy windows
Ain't nobody can see
Steamy windows
Coming from the body heat

Steamy windows
Zero visibility
Steamy windows
Coming from the body heat

Steamy windows
Steamy windows
Steamy windows...
