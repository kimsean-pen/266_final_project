The water is shallow
And her tears still reflects from
Yesterdays trauma and failure.
There's something in the wind
Like a whisper longing to be heard,

As someone is yelling - FIRE!
Our city lies in flames.
I'm reaching out for help but I'm choking on the ashes.
We are watching them all burn to death -
They were woman and children

All eyes turn away from this horrible sight,
Can you hear us fighting for our lives?
Heartbreaking screams from the ashes.
Through the cyanide in the skyline the devils eyes are upon us
