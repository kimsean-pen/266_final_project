Was it worth it for the view.
It all looked good from up there.
All the roses were in bloom.
There was pollen in the air.
It all comes and goes.
It all comes and goes.
All these woes.

I put three daisies in the notebook
And watched the petals all fall out.
It made a mark upon the paper.
A mark that could not be rubbed out.

It all comes and goes.
All these woes.
All these woes.
