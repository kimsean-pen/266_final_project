If you twist and turn away
If you tear yourself in two again
If I could, you know, I would
If I could, I would
Let it go
Surrender
Dislocate

If I could throw this lifeless life-line to the wind
Leave this heart of clay
See you break, break away
Into the night
Through the rain
Into the half-light
Through the flame

If I could through myself
Set your spirit free, I'd lead your heart away
See you break, break away
Into the light
Through the day

Ooh, ooooh... ooh, ooooh...
Oh, ooh, ooooh...

Ooh, oooh... ooh, oooh...
Oh, ooh, oooh...

So let it go (hum-hum)
And so fade away
To let it go (oh-hum)
And so, fade away
(huh!)

Wide awake
I'm wide awake...
I'm not sleeping

Oh, no, ...no... no, no
I'm not sleeping
Ooh, oooh, oh, oh, oh!

If they should ask will maybe they
Tell me what I should say
True colors fly in blue and black
Bruised silken sky and burning flag
Colors crash, collide in bloodshot eyes

If I could, you know I would, if I could, I would
Let it go

This desperation...

Separation...

Condemnation, revidation... in temptation
Isolation, desolation, isolation
Let it go (oh-oh)
And so fade away
To let it go (oh-oh)
And so fade... fade!... Fade away!

(huh!)

Ooh-oooooh...

humm... I'm fade away... 'way! hey
hum! I'm fade away... no... no, no, no!
I'm fade away...

(...)

Wide awake!...
I'm wide awake... 'wake...
Wide awake!...
I'm wide awake!...
Wide awake! ooh-oh...
I'm not sleeping

Oh, no... no, no, no.
I'm not sleeping

C'mon town!
C'mon town!
C'mon town!
Sing it!

C'mon town!
