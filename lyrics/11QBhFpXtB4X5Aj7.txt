So they tell me
Hold him while you can
And you show me
How it is to know a man
And it all seems right
When we talk through the night

How could I know
How this would go?

It's a first for me
It's a pain I need
It's too good to be
Please don't leave
Please don't leave

So I let go
Moments at a time
'Cause I know soon
I am losing what is mine
But I say too much
To justify your touch

How could I know
How this would go?

It's a first for me
It's a pain I need
It's too good to be
Please don't leave
It's a first for me
It's a pain I need
It's too good to be
Please don't leave
Please don't leave
