Fun fun fun in the fluffy chair
Flame up the herb
Woof down the beer

Fun fun fun in the fluffy chair
Flame up the herb
Woof down the beer

Hi, I'm your video DJ
I always talk like I'm wigged out on quaaludes
I wear a satin baseball jacket everywhere I go

My job is to help destroy
What's left of your imagination
By feeding you endless doses of sugar-coated mindless garbage

So don't create, be sedate
Be a vegetable at home and thwack on that dial
If we have our way even you will believe
This is the future of rock and roll

MTV get off the air!

How far will you go, how low will you stoop
To tranquilize our minds with your sugar-coated swill
You've turned rock and roll rebellion into Pat Boone sedation
Making sure nothing's left to the imagination

MTV get off the...
MTV get off the...
MTV get off the air!

MTV get off the...
MTV get off the...
MTV get off the air!
Get off the air

See the latest rejects from the muppet show
Wag their tits and their dicks as they lip-synch on screen
There's something I don't like about a band who always smiles
Another tax write-off for some schmuck who doesn't care

MTV get off the...
MTV get off the...
MTV get off the air!

MTV get off the...
MTV get off the...
MTV get off the air!
Get off the air
Get off the air
Get off the air

And so it was our beloved corporate gods
Claimed they created rock video
Allowing it to sink as low in one year
As commercial TV has in 25

"It's the new frontier," they say
It's wide open, anything can happen
But you've got a lot of nerve to call yourself a pioneer
When you're too god-damn conservative to take real chances

Tin-eared
Graph-paper brained accountants instead of music fans
Call all the shots at giant record companies now
The lowest common denominator rules

Forget honesty, forget creativity
The dumbest buy the mostest, that's the name of the game
But sales are slumping and no one will say why
Could it be they put out one too many lousy records?!?

MTV get off the air!
Now!
