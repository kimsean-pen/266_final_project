Somebody wants you, someone out there
Somebody needs you, somebody cares
Somebody loves you, someone somewhere
But if nobody's there

Here they come again, whispers in my head
Same old sad refrain wished I'd never said
What I said, yeah take me to the top
I need more not less and don't ever tell me when to stop

Here comes tomorrow and yesterday's news
Empty and hollow broken and bruised
No one to follow, nothing to lose
And only you can choose

Here they come again, whispers in my head
Same old sad refrain wished I'd never said
What I said, yeah take me to the top
I need more not less and don't ever tell me when to stop

Here they come again, whispers in my head
Same old sad refrain wished I'd never said
What I said, yeah take me to the top
I need more not less and don't ever tell me when to stop

Somebody wants you, someone out there

Somebody loves you, someone somewhere
But if nobody's there

Here they come again, whispers in my head

I need more not less and don't ever tell me when to stop

Here they come again, whispers in my head
