Penny, I love you
You're so sweet and warm inside
Penny, I need you
Your beauty should be televised

Little do they know
I think you're the one
I'm thinking 'bout who might know

Of a gun, oh no
I've gotta run, oh no
He's not the one, I know
That's why I made it known
Yes, I made it known

(That) Penny, I love you
This cell its so cold inside
Penny, I need you
Your face is starting to fade from my mind

Little do they know
I think you're the one
I'm thinking 'bout how I'm suppose

To break free, oh no
To get back to you, oh no
You won't answer my letters, I know
That's why I'll prove to you that I'm the only one

And If I can't convey my love
Maybe the stars will take their course, yeah yeah yeah
If the zodiac wastes my love
I know I'll die the loneliest
I know I'll die the loneliest

If you want her back, say: "Ay-ay-ay-ah"
If you want her bad, say: "Ay-ay-ay-ah"
If you want it back, say: "Ay-ay-ay-ah"

Oh no
I've gotta run, oh no
He's not the one, I know
That's why I made it known
Yes, I made it known
