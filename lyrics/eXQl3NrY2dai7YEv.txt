Driving to Flight Number 107
With you sitting by my side
First class blue
Sky and a melody brand new
Almost makes me cry
Don't know why

Smile at your smile
Time is one past eleven
You're passing me a piece of apple pie
Oh, it almost makes us cry
Don't know why

Go make a sign in your car
It's the place where I've been happy
Make a sign in your car
It's the place where I've been happy

Driving to Flight Number 107
With you sitting by my side
Nine miles are not too long for a farewell
With you and I close my eyes

Hold you fast
And when you ask me woman
Don't be sad
Oh, it really makes me cry
Don't know why

Go make a sign in your car
It's the place where I've been happy
Make a sign in your car
It's the place where I've been happy
