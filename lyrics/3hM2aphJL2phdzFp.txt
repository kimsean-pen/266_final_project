I must be honest
Under the surface
It grinds like a blender
The sound of two voices
My heart seems to fail me
It put me in a stranger's bed
It hurt who I love the most
I'll never trust it again

That's why I don't want what I want
'Cause what I want, it just might kill me
And I won't think of my needs
'Cause what I need, I know there's never enough for me

Envy is endless
I used to put mistakes up on a board
Compare how mine sticks
Next to the rest of the worlds'
That got me nowhere but miles from changing
Now I've got deep stains
And bleach won't erase them

That's why I don't want what I want
'Cause what I want, it just might kill me
And I won't think of my needs
'Cause what I need, I know there's never enough for me

Call me on everything
'Cause I can't see how it looks from your perspective
Call me on everything
'Cause I can't help myself and I need your protection from me
I lose every time
I lose every time
I lose every time

You think you're inspiring
Posting slogans on a photo of the sky
You're letting sleeping dogs lie
It's not so simple as
Do what makes you happy
If that's the same thing
That will destroy me

That's why I don't want what I want
'Cause what I want, it just might kill me
And I won't think of my needs
'Cause what I need, I know there's never enough for me
I must be honest
(For me)
Under the surface
It grinds like a blender
(I know there's never enough for me)
The sound of two voices
My heart seems to fail me
(For me)
It put me in a stranger's bed
It hurt who I love the most
(What I need, I know there's never enough for me)
I'll never trust it again
