Fall asleep up high On moss
Covered fallen Tree
Water opens slowly

Land drifts apart
In dreams
Morning singing
You weave

Tree sound in wind
Or is it the sound
Of water

Land drifts apart
In dreams
Morning singing
You weave
Your hand
Through the sunbeam
Land drifts apart
In dreams

Fall asleep up high On moss
Covered fallen Tree
Water opens slowly

Land drifts apart
In dreams
Morning singing
You weave
Your hand
Through the sunbeam
Land drifts apart
In dreams

(Follow it to where
A mountain
Is beginning)
