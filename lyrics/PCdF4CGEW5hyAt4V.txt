I've been waiting here on the outside
I've been watching you from afar

The colour of your fear
Confusion deep inside
Resentment boils over
In me, you can confide
You say you've lost your world
You say you've lost your faith
I'll be the shelter in the dark
Clothe you in my hate

Profiteers and preachers
Sycophants and leachers

The Revanchist - his thoughts become mine
How deep they become intertwined
He said
Submit for salvation
Submit for salvation
The age old lie

Submit for salvation

I've been calling you from the twilight
I've been pushing you to the edge

The way you say my name
The poison on your tongue
The lies they tell - pay your mind
I am the only one
You never turned your back
You didn't need to see
'Cause even in the dead of night
You found your way to me

Profiteers and preachers
Sycophants and leachers

The Revanchist - his thoughts become mine
How deep they become intertwined
He said
Submit for salvation
Submit for salvation
The age old lie

Submit for salvation

I've been waiting here on the outside
I've been watching you from afar

The colour of your fear
Confusion deep inside
Resentment boils over
In me, you can confide
You say you've lost your world
You say you've lost your faith
I'll be the shelter in the dark
Clothe you in my hate

Profiteers and preachers
Sycophants and leachers

The Revanchist - his thoughts become mine
How deep they become intertwined
He said
Submit for salvation
Submit for salvation
The age old lie

He said
Submit for salvation
Submit for salvation
The age old lie

Submit for salvation
