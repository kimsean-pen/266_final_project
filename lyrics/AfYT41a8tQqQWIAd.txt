the women are dressed up and they are up to no good
you're dressed up for liberation
you flash that fire flag you fly above
the bright hot sails of your eyes
they say vaguely goodbye(x2)
there is a long delay in our words
then there are no words
and I lay down tonight as nervous as a bride
she's not nervous but she tries(x2)
and it's vaguely goodbye(x3)
