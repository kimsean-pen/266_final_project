In the first days
Of the springtime
Made you a prince with a thousand enemies
Made a trail of
A thousand tears
Made you a prisoner inside your own secrecy.

There's a ghost in me
Who wants to say I'm sorry
Doesn't mean I'm sorry

At the first hour
Of the springtime
Made you a prince with a thousand enemies
Now I see you
From the corner
Clock strikes and I know you will be drinking alone

There's a ghost in me
Who wants to say I'm sorry
Doesn't mean I'm sorry There's a ghost in me
Who wants to say I'm sorry
Doesn't mean I'm sorry There's a ghost in me
Who wants to say I'm sorry
Doesn't mean I'm sorry There's a ghost in me
Who wants to say I'm sorry
Doesn't mean I'm sorry End
