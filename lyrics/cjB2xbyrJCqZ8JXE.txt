We should get some chills
Pulling up in them brand news wheels
Don't need couple hundred mills
Walking Rodeo Beverly Hills
We should get some chills
Ambition we keep it trill
Ain't no matter 'bout what you feel
Slow down we can get some chills ey

Gotta get them chills, party like every day Sunday
Gotta get them chills, celebrate like every day birthday
Rock it like we driving through the endless highway
All them Party DNA inside my blood

Catch me throwing away all them phones
Can't stop me, we gon chill and party I announce
Catch me, we gon party with no stress 'til noon
Don't think about leaving right now it's too soon

We gon ball so hard we made it
Fly so high we made it
Dripping all along we made it
Tell them we got the sauce we made it
Ball so hard we made it
Fly so high we made it
Dripping all along we made it
Tell them we got the sauce we made it
Aye one man, I made it
Ya we all, we made it
Aye one man, I made it
Ya we all, we made it
Aye one man, I made it
Ya we all, we made it
Aye one man, I made it
Ya we all, we made it
I'm just who I am
Got no time for them

I'll be traveling everywhere, can't stand no traffic jam
I've been cooking them vibes since day one
Putting WANG flavor all over them
Getting that taste, put a little WANG sauce
All begging me for another one

Walk talk it like a boss now
24 be the year now
Got time for the bet now
We gon give it all out
Riding rollercoaster
Popping in the air now
Enjoying all the process

Catch me throwing away all them phones
Can't stop me, we gon chill and party I announce
Catch me, we gon party with no stress 'til noon
Don't think about leaving right now it's too soon yeah
We gon ball so hard we made it
Fly so high we made it
Dripping all along we made it
Tell them we got the sauce, we made it
Ball so hard we made it
Fly so high we made it
Dripping all along we made it
Tell them we got the sauce we made it
Aye one man, I made it
Ya we all, we made it
Aye one man, I made it
Ya we all, we made it
Aye one man, I made it
Ya we all, we made it
Aye one man, I made it
Ya we all, we made it
