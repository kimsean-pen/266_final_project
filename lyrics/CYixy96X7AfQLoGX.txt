This house is sad
Because he's not
Inside

It, it, it, it
Because he'd hide
When someone comes

To the
Front door, door, door, door
There's no one, there's no one
There's no one, no one

There's no one, there's no one

There's no one, no one. . .
To say meow, kitties
Meow, kitties
Meow, kitties. . .
