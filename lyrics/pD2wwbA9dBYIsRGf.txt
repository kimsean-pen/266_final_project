I live surrounded by cherished memories
I have a weakness for collecting them
Alphabetize
As far as I recall my childish rituals
Icons of that world
Always filled my shelves and heart

Now I shelter from the rain
Hole up in my cage
You don't have to think too much today
They filled in for your brain

Curled up
Deprived
Curled up
Deprived
I shut away

In a world of synonyms
And handwritten notes
My own puppet performances
Endless bedtime stories
I could touch the moon
And switch off the sun
I could have my dreams
And dream about better times

Now I shelter from the rain
Hole up in my cage
You don't have to think too much today
They filled in for your brain

Curled up
Deprived
Curled up
Deprived
I shut away
Please don't call my name
