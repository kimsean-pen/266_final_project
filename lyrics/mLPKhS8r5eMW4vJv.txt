Lost as I may be
In the fog of my own noise and triviality
Grand Holy Mother, grant me clarity
I am standing on the edge of forever.
Forever.

One among infinity
Witnessing the majesty
Calm in this humility
Witnessing the majesty
Hope as far as one can see
Witnessing the majesty
Standing on the edge of forever

Blessed that be in
This reawakening
Grand Holy Mother, and my deadly slumber, to
Stand fearless from the edge of forever.
Forever.

One among infinity
Witnessing the majesty
Calm in this humility
Witnessing the majesty
Hope as far as one can see
Witnessing the majesty
Standing on the edge of forever

Hope as far
As one can see
As one can see
