Who knows what tomorrow will bring,
Maybe sunshine, maybe rain,
But as for me always the same,
Maybe it'll bring my love to me. [no]

Who knows what tomorrow will bring,
Maybe sunshine, maybe rain,
But as for me always the same,
Maybe it'll bring my love to me. [no]

Sometimes I feel rainy days.
Just to let you know,
It's happening to me,
Alright. (?)
