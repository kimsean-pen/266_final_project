I dreamt we spoke
I dreamt we spoke again
It had been so long
It had been so long
My mind filled in the blanks
I dreamt we spoke,
I dreamt we spoke again
It had been so long
It had been so long
Your voice was like a ghost

In my head
In my head

Only in, yes, only in a dream
Is anything, is anything the way it used to be?
I dreamt we spoke
I dreamt we spoke again
But when I awoke, when I awoke
I could not remember

Anything you said
Anything you said
Anything you said
Anything you said
