One hundred years is not enough
The legacy is not forgotten
Words still burns like fire
The fate of immortality

Into the forest
Everything silent but the voice of the air
Here man can find the childish happiness
That one won't find when man is near

One hundred years is not enough
The legacy is not forgotten
Words still burns like fire
The fate of immortality

A carefree state of mind
Distant from the noise that makes us blind
Untouched and unseen by all
The great stillness will come

One hundred years is not enough
The legacy is not forgotten
Words still burns like fire
The fate of immortality
