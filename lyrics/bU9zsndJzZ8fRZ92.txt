When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep

And dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth

Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall

In the night, the stormy night
She closed her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

And dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

She'd dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

And so lying underneath the stormy skies
She'd say, "Oh, I know the sun must set to rise"

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
