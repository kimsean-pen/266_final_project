Looks like I wrote this song on paper
First time I did that in like 3 years.
My handwriting is horrible and I can barely read this

Don't even know what's in my head anymore tho
Figured out I ain't gonna go to college, Lee Corso
F-ckin girls but I never kept the door closed
Want you all to hear the way I put it in her torso
I ain't normal, I'm clinically insane
I guess it's the result of drugs that entering my brain
All of a sudden, every legend is mentioning my name
All that does is show me that my life will never be the same
Police trying to figure out how to get me locked up
I tell those cops suck dog nuts
Arriving to the party in a chariot
Looking for a scary bitch that I can pop her cherry pit
I'm very sick, yes very ill
Eternal Sunshine, Jim Carey feel
At the amusement park scared of heights: ferris wheel
Double dare me to kill?

A little soul like De La do, they say I'm new
It's nothing but some Deja Vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Deja Vu, Deja Vu

Wind chimes, sick rhymes
Been high on this incline
Tryna get my money stacking tall: 6'9"
Have some caviar, sip wine
Sacrifice insanity, sacrifice normal
Purpose is for people in the plural
Form never formal
An art form, not a mural
Work 4 bars that are tighter than your corn rows
See a girl that's looking horny in the 4th row
I just put it in her mouth: orthodontist
Manipulating phonics, put em into sonnets
Let me put you on this nastier than Nas is
Bubonic plague, bacteria that's trying to find a way
Spread, Like yolk from a broken egg
Talking shit? You just digging your grave

A little soul like De La do, they say I'm new
It's nothing but some Deja Vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Deja Vu, Deja Vu

Hypothetically I'm dope, I keep incredibly
Potentially could be the remedy
For happiness without the ecstasy
No methamphetamine
Hotter than 110 degrees
Visually stunning
You gotta see it on the LED
When I was 17 I thought I had it figured out
Now I see what it's about
Went down a different route, it's crucial
Life with a spoonful of sugar, yea I need my medicine
F-ckin Mary Poppins
Gotta treat her like the president
Represent all these people that I never met
Some expect me to be the greatest ever
Hear me on the radio, shit'll change forever
Now I'm just a pop sensation, f-ck your expectations!
I'mma be the best, have some patience...
Thought that it was great, then poof

A little soul like De La do, they say I'm new
It's nothing but some Deja Vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Deja Vu, Deja Vu
