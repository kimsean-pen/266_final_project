You got me all wrong
You left me under water
To tumble and fall
So many years ago

You got me all wrong
You got me all wrong
You got me all wrong
You got me all wrong

You got me all wrong
You wandered away
Without which I am nothing
Much more than I can say

You got me all wrong
You got me all wrong
You got me all wrong
You got me all wrong
