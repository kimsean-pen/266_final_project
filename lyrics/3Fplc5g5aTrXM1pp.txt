Is it too late to prevent their fall?
Are they ready for the key to it all?
The mystery solved, the answer to life
The final solution, a chance to survive

We can save this ill-fated race
Who are lost in the ocean of space
Show them the way to reverse their decline
Guide them back on the river of time

Follow the wave, speed up the flight
Slow down time, faster than light
Unite the forces, take a giant leap
Bend the stream, dive into the deep

We can save this ill-fated race
Who are lost in the ocean of space
Show them the way to reverse their decline
Guide them back on the river of time

Send back visions of war and decay
Paradigms of fear in a world of dismay
Shape the present, alter the past
Create a new future, one that would last

We can save this ill-fated race
Who are lost in the ocean of space
Show them the way to reverse their decline
Guide them back on the river of time
