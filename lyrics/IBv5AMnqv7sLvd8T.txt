If I believed in god I would not have done the things you've done
because you were only half willing to follow the son

You take our homes but your framework doesn't hold
against the feet of us giants
you've been alone and you're singing to the sun
cause you know you're on your own and you're going home

Like an animal burying its bones
but leaving fingerprints on the walls inside my home
but if we're so different then why did we start this?

You take our homes but your framework doesn't hold
against the feet of us giants
you've been alone and you're singing to the sun
cause you know you're on your own and you're going home

You can hide it if you want to but everybody knows it's true
buried everything you knew but they won't keep a thing from you
