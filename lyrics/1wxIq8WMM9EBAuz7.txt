I don't always stay right on the track
But somehow I know that I'll come back
See, I haven't lost sight before

Through words, words I cannot scream
Than along a glistening stream
'Til I find the open sea
Lying right there for me

Well, I'm not the only person looking for a clue
I see by the footprints in the sand that you are too
So maybe together we can find a path that's really true

And civilization marches on
Occasionally prone to get it wrong
Though it might seem we're lost
We never sit down too long

And off in the distance you see me
Just know this is how it's meant to be
Now I have got this far
I believe in the one true path
