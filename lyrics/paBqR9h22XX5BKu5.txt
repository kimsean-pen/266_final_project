I hear a ruckus in the back
Tall shadows on the wall
Mabel, won't you wake up
We got lawyers in the barn
Yes we do, all the rumors
They're all true
Don't worry, baby, I know what to do

Many years ago there was a case of legalese
Thankfully my granddad
Handed down those ancient ways
Yes he did (folk magic) the real deal
Folk magic, hot off the grill

Woo! Ghoul wrangler, shut 'em down
Ghoul wrangler, shut 'em down
Licensed and bonded
I should get a business card
Certified
Ghoul wrangler

I sneak up to the coop and
See them chewing on the bones
Spitting backwards Latin at mobile phones
Yes they were
Frothing at the mouth like rabid beasts
Diabolical to say the least

At the sight of me
They bare their flashing yellow claws
Bits of old, poor Chester
White falling from their mouths
Yes they were, hackles rose, air grew chill
Folk magic, hot off the grill

Woo! Ghoul wrangler,shut 'em down
Ghoul wrangler, shut 'em down
Licensed and bonded
I should get a business card
Certified
Ghoul wrangler

Thirteen bloody litigators
Feasting on the hog
My god, Mabel, we got lawyers in the barn

Twelve of them dispatched and
Now there's one more left to go
I track his penny-loafers
Through the freshly fallen snow
Yes I did
I find him in the old stockyard
We got different laws down on the farm

Woo! Ghoul wrangler, shut 'em down
Ghoul wrangler, shut 'em down
Licensed and bonded
I should get a business card
Big time
Ghoul wrangler

Thirteen bloody litigators
Feasting on the hog
My god, Mabel, we got lawyers in the barn
Thirteen bloody litigators
Feasting on the hog
My god, Mabel, we got lawyers in the barn
