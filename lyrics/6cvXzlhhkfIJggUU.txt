I was looking for a friend
And it all came to an end
But I survived, yeah I survived
Oh, you came across the sea
Swam the ocean just for me
Now I'm alive, yeah I'm alive

What we do it's a game that you can't play
And we're losing it every time
If it lasted we could be in heaven
Well it stops and needs to dry

But here I go again
Back the way you came
Into the coldest, into the coldest water
Here I go again
No masterplan
Into the coldest, into the coldest water
Into the coldest water

Yeah, I was talking to a friend
About what happens in the end
And realised, realised
That one day we'd be in the ground
And all the colours we are now
Will fade in time, they fade in time

What we do it's a game that you can't play
And we're losing it every time
If it lasted we could be in heaven
Well it stops and needs to dry

But here I go again
Back the way you came
Into the coldest, into the coldest water
Here I go again
No masterplan
Into the coldest, into the coldest water
Into the coldest water
Into the coldest water

Yeah, I used to be like that
No, it's not a long way back
Yeah, I used to be like that
No, it's not a long way back
You should have seen how they found me

But here I go again
Back the way you came
Into the coldest, into the coldest water
Here I go again
No masterplan
Into the coldest, into the coldest water

Yeah, I used to be like that
No, it's not a long way back
(Into the coldest water)
Yeah, I used to be like that
No, it's not a long way back
(Into the coldest water)
