Don't drag me down, stop hiding me
It's time you see, you're breaking me

Your playing truth, I know the truth
It's killing me, what you believe

Stop hiding me, I'm running free
Can't drag me down, won't turn around
Won't live without these words I breathe

Stay awake
Wide awake
Smother me
I can't breathe
Eyes dilate
Here's my fate
Far too late
Suffocate
Suffocate

I've seen you drown, your memory
But still intent, on breaking me

Your playing truth, I know the truth
I'll never be, how it should be

Your fooling me, to think I'm free
Its deathly eyes, that's all I see
Can't live without these words we breathe

Stay awake
Wide awake
Smother me
I can't breathe
Eyes dilate
Here's my fate
Far too late
Suffocate
Suffocate
