I'm good at wasting time
I think lyrics need to rhyme
And you're not asking
But I'm trying to grow a mustache
I eat cheese, but only on pizza please
Sometimes, on a homemade quesadilla
Otherwise it smells like feet to me
And I, I really like it when the moon looks like a toenail
And I love you when you say my name

If you wanna know, here it goes
Gonna tell ya there's a part of me that shows
If were close gonna let you see everything
But remember that you asked for it
I'm trying to do my best to impress
But it's easier to let you take a guess at the rest
But you wanna hear what lives in my brain, in my heart
Well, you asked for it
For your perusing
At times confusing
Slightly amusing

Introducing me

Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do

La da da da
La da da da da da da da

I never trust a dog to watch my food
And I like to use the word dude as a noun or an adverb or an adjective

And I, I never really been into cars
I like really cool guitars
And superheroes and checks with lots of zeros on 'em

I love the sound of violins and making someone smile
If you wanna know, here it goes
Gonna tell ya there's a part of me that shows
If were close gonna let you see everything
But remember that you asked for it
I'm trying to do my best to impress
But it's easier to let ya take a guess at the rest
But you wanna hear what lives in my brain, in my heart

Well, you asked for it
For your perusing

At times confusing
Possibly amusing

Introducing me
Well you probably know more then you ever wanted to

So be careful when you ask me next time
So, if you wanna know, here it goes
Gonna tell ya there's a part of me that shows
If were close gonna let you see everything
But remember that you asked for it
I'm trying to do my best to impress

But it's easier to let you take a guess at the rest
But you wanna hear what lives in my brain, in my heart
Well, you asked for it
For your perusing
At times confusing
Hopefully amusing
Introducing me
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do
Introducing me
