When you're feeling down
And your sky is grey
And the people that you love
Well they have nothing lovely to say
When your days are long
And lonlier than before
When your bed is cold
And the sheep are at your door

I'll take you away
I'll take you away
I'll take you
I'll take you away
I'll take you away

When you're tired of working like a slave
And the smell of the coffee bean
Well it just won't go away
And your friends
Well they've got nothing good to say
You just call out my name

And I'll take you away
I'll take you away
I'll take you
I'll take you away
I'll take you away

I'll take you away
I'll take you away
I'll take you
I'll take you away
I will take you away
