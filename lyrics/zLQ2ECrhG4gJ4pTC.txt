Just sit back
And tell me
I'm a liar for this
Don't roll your eyes
Rewind
This happens
Way too many times

So sit back
And tell me that your
Tired of this
I know
I'll grow up someday
But it's 2am
And I'm too high and dry
And I won't come down to

So when I come back
I won't say a word
I know
I've said this before
Don't speak, liar

No we won't talk
We won't say a word
I know
You've heard this before
Don't speak, liar

Sit back
And tell me why
I'm so prone to this
Do you think I'm fond of
Getting you and letting you down
And I'll get mine soon

So when I come back
I won't say a word
I know
I've said this before
Don't speak, liar

No we won't talk
We won't say a word
I know
You've heard this before
Don't speak, liar

And if the story ends here
I can't be surprised to find
Your eyes are open wide
And that I have inspired you

And when you come back
Don't say a word
I know
You've said this before
Don't speak, liar

No we won't talk
We won't say a word
I know
We've heard this before
Don't speak, liar
Don't speak, liar
Whoa-oh
Don't speak, liar
