Yeah

I think I've said enough
But I'm not thinking anymore
Adrenaline has pumped me up
And I can't even see the floor
My vision's blurred and I'm screaming

Down in a hole, I think I'm losing control
Of all the voices screaming out in my head
(No control)
I'm so far gone
Feel like it's been so damn long
Since I could shut my fucking mouth instead
(I've got no control)
I've got no control
(No control)

It's just a little more
But it's more than I need
A self-afflicted wound
This time the knife has cut too deep
I'm on the floor and I'm bleeding

Down in a hole, I think I'm losing control
Of all the voices screaming out in my head
(No control)
I'm so far gone
Feel like it's been so damn long
Since I could shut my fucking mouth instead
(I've got no control)
I've got no control
(No control)

Down in a hole, I think I'm losing control
Of all the voices screaming out in my head
(No control)
I'm so far gone
Feel like it's been so damn long
Since I could shut my fucking mouth instead
(I've got no control)
I've got no control
(No control)
