Someone I loved once gave me a box full of darkness
It took me years to understand that this too, was a gift
It took me years to realize you teared my heart through fordable mires
But I wasn't made for shallow waters, my heart is an ocean...

And I think that's where I am right now: Floating, drifting away
Too weak to continue swimming, yet not weak enough to give up and sink
Leastwise I know now, that salty waters might cure everything
Shedding tears... ...or to walk into the sea...

Did you know, if you hold your breath all too long
You will finally sleep forever?
Did you know, that I never forgave myself
For what we've become?
How odd I can have all of this inside me
And to you it's just words, another letter???
But what is loss? What is wealth?
I am nothing! We are nothing...!

We are nothing...!

I am the mourning
You are the scars
I am the night
Color me black
I am the mourning
You are the scars
I am the night
Color me black

There's a place in my heart that will never be filled
And even during the best and the greatest times
I will know it... ...more than ever
I will know it... ...more than ever

In another night, in another world
Things could have been so different
In another night, in another world
Things would have been so different

I am the mourning
You are the scars
I am the night
Color me black
I am the mourning
You are the scars
I am the night
Color me black
