Tear the roots
What would you need?
You cull and choose
With your jealousies
Hey no heart -
Why would you make me feel this way?
How will the bleeding stop
When deceit has been laid?

How we gon leave
Cold ground got a hold on me
On my knees
Beg here for time

How we gon leave
Cold ground got a hold on me
On my knees
Beg here for light

Tolerate
What's the use?
Why can't we grow
What we abuse?
Hex my mind
Why would you make this ground your grave?
The royal and the soil in me
Can't reconcile who's to blame

How we gon leave
Cold ground got a hold on me
On my knees
Beg here for time

How we gon leave
Cold ground got a hold on me
On my knees
Beg here for light
How we gon leave
Cold ground got a hold on me
On my knees
Beg here for time

How we gon leave
Cold ground got a hold on me
On my knees
Beg here for light
How we gon leave
Cold ground got a hold on me
On my knees
Beg here for time
