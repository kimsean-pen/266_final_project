I tried to pretend I couldn't die for so long.
(Ooh-oh) I... catch my bleeding heart for a song.
I slept in a flame becase it made me feel strong
Building up my
ice to never thaw, ice to never...

I couldn't help myself.
I'd frozen all the doors.
I didn't want you here but
a heartbeat reached for yours.

I thought that an "I" was so much less than a "you".
Blind devotion
never sees the things that you do.
I slept in a flame to keep me open and true.
(Oh)
I couldn't help myself
I've frozen all the doors.
I didn't want you here, but
my heartbeat reached for yours.

I ran
so far I didn't know it was me
but now there's
nothing holding me here and nowhere else that I'd rather go
or be.
I ran
so hard that it was all that I knew
but now there's
nothing holding me here and nowhere else that I'd rather go
with you.
Oh.

(Fear of dying woke me up and pulled me through)
(Fear of dying woke me up and pulled me through)
It woke me up and pulled me through.
(Fear of dying woke me up and pulled me through)
It woke me up and pulled me through.
(Fear of dying woke me up and pulled me through)

I ran
so far I didn't know it was me
but now there's
nothing holding me here and nowhere else that I'd rather go
or be.
