It's time to run, they'll string me up for all that I've done
I'm going soon, gonna leave tonight by the light of the moon
I did it all for you, well, I hope you know the lengths I've gone to
What's a man to say, they'll be looking for me, should be on my way

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I wanted everybody else in the world to know
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I wanted everyone to know that you're the girl for me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I wanted everybody else in the world to know it
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, but I ain't ever gonna let 'em take my life from me

I've no regrets, I will not ask for your forgiveness
Lower your defense, run away with me and it'll all make sense
I did it all for you, don't spurn me after all I've gone through
No time to rest, I'm gonna find me a life, baby, way out west

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I wanted everybody else in the world to know
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I wanted everyone to know that you're the girl for me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I wanted everybody else in the world to know it
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I ain't never

I will run but I know that I'm beat
I decided my fate with my deeds
I will run but I know that I'm beat
I decided my fate with my deeds

It's time to run, well, I hope you understand what I've done
Run away for you, I'm gonna count the days 'til you make it through
I did it all for you, well, I hope you live the life you want to
My time is spent, baby, please don't tell 'em just where I went

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I wanted everybody else in the world to know
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I wanted everyone to know you're the girl for me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I wanted everybody else in the world to know it
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, but I ain't ever gonna let 'em take the life from me

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I wanted everybody else in the world to know it
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I wanted everyone to know you're the girl for me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I wanted everybody else in the world to know it
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I ain't never
