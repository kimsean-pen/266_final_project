Another game of cards, sticky fingers and pizza boxes
Tiny bursts of flame, telephone in the microwave
Time keeps seeping through our skin and through our hair
Your translucent body feels like it's not there

We are never alone, we are never alone
We are never alone, we are never alone
We are never alone, we are never alone
We are never alone

We want to see, we want to see
Your dark heart, your dark heart
We want to see, we want to see
Your dark heart, your dark heart

Tiny kinks in time making trouble in your direction
Darkly coloured thoughts making plans for a tiny future
Pain keeps creeping through your skin and through your brains
Your translucent body lost in its own way

We are never alone, we are never alone
We are never alone

Nothing like our flesh is gonna beat us down
Watching as the leaves fall
Nothing like our heads is gonna make us proud
Watching as the tea leaves crawl
We don't need to be illuminated
Not like the river-boats
Nothing like our flesh is gonna beat us

We are never alone, we are never alone
We are never alone, we are never alone
We are never alone, we are never alone
We are never alone, we are never alone
We are never alone, we are never alone
We are never alone

We want to see, we want to see
Your dark heart, your dark heart
We want to see, we want to see
Your dark heart (Your dark heart)
We want to see, we want to see
Your dark heart, your dark heart
We want to see, we want to see
Your dark heart, your dark heart
