Ahh, yeah yeah
You've got to show me love

Heartbreaks and promises
I've had more than my share
I'm tired of giving my love
And getting nowhere, nowhere

What I need is somebody
Who really cares
I really need a lover
A lover that wants to be there

It's been so long
Since I touched a wanting hand
I can't put my love on the line
That I hope you'll understand

So baby if you want me
You've got to show me love
Words are so easy to say, oh ah yeah
You've got to show me love

I'm tired of getting caught up
In those one night affairs
What I really need is somebody
Who will always be there

Don't you promise me the world
All that I've already heard

This time around for me baby
Actions speak louder than words

If you're looking for devotion, talk to me
Come with your heart in your hand
Because my love is guaranteed

So baby if you want me
You've got to show me love
Words are so easy to say, oh ah yeah
You've got to show me love

Show me, show me baby
You've got to give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me, yeah
I don't want no fakes, don't want no phoney
I need your love

Show me, show me, show me baby
Give it to me, give it to me
I am not a toy, I'm not a play thang
You've got to understand

If you're looking for devotion, talk to me
Come with your heart in your hand
Because me love is guaranteed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
