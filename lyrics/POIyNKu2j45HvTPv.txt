We'd better think about the things we say
We'd better think about the games we play
The world went round, around and round

We'd better think about the consequences
We'd better think about the global senses
The time went out, the time went out

What about Chernobyl?
What about radiation?
We don't know, we don't know

What about deprivation?
Gluttony, the human nation?
We don't know, we don't know
For me love is all, for me love is all
For me love is all, for me love is all

Time is ticking out

Looks like we screwed up the ozone layer
I wonder if the politicians care
And time went out, and time went out

What about our children then?
Is there nothing left for them?
We don't know, we don't know
For me love is all, for me love is all
For me love is all, for me love is all
Ahh they need oxygen, ahh they need oxygen
For me love is all, for me love is all
For me love is all, for me love is all
Time is ticking out yeah
The time is ticking out
