Here I am, as you made me, telling bare faced lies
Eyes look at me all naked, I let my pretty garden grow wild
It's free to look upon me, and see the tears I cry
This is me with no makeup, falling like a fool out of pride You need to like an asymmetric body
You're smiling at my crooked smile
I never thought that I was perfect in the bruise, babe
I'm alright in your eyes I just want you to look upon me, and see the good inside
What do you see when you look upon me, telling bare faced lies?
Naturally I'm not a blondie, not every hair is dyed All stripped back
Bare, clean scrubbed face
Sliding out of place
You made me feel
I could be an honest last
Just like in the past Any lingering doubt 'bout your love is just irrelevant now
At the worst of my worst you didn't leave me, are all my imperfections allowed?
You're a fool to always forgive me, and see the good inside
It's cruel to make you feel guilty, when I let me pretty garden go wild Though bare faced lies
Tried to hide behind the dishonesties
Made a mockery when my life is blessed
With a lazy eye and a crooked smile
These things now are superfluous, would be perfectless
You're constraining me, there's no symmetry Even getting dressed
There's a lazy eye
So I'll be brave, I'll stay, it'll face myself
You're constraining me, there's no symmetry
There's a lazy eye, and a crooked smile
No art or feel to this, just an honest kiss
You're constraining me, there's no symmetry
There's a lazy eye, and a crooked smile
