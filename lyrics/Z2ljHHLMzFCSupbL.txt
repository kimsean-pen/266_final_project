You don't need no friends
Get back your faith again
You have the power to believe
Another dissident
Take back your evidence
It has no power to deceive

I'll believe it, when I see it for myself

I don't need no one, to tell me about Heaven
I look at my daughter, and I believe
I don't need no proof
When it comes to God and truth
I can see the sunset and I perceive

Sit with them all night
Everything they say is right
But in the morning, they were wrong
I'll be right by your side
Come hell or water high
Down any road you choose to roam

I'll believe it, when I see it for myself

I don't need no one, to tell me about Heaven
I look at my daughter, and I believe
I don't need no proof
When it comes to God and truth
I can see the sunset and I perceive, yeah

Darling I believe, oh
Sometimes it's hard to breathe, oh Lord
At the bottom of the sea, yeah yeah

I'll believe it, when I see it for myself

I don't need no one, to tell me about Heaven
I look at my daughter, and I believe
I don't need no proof
When it comes to God and truth
I can see the sunset and I perceive

I don't need no one, to tell me about Heaven
I look at my daughter, and I believe
I don't need no proof
When it comes to God and truth
I can see the sunset
I can see the sunset
I can see the sunset
I don't need no one, oh yeah
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
I don't need no one, to tell me about Heaven, oh
I believe, yeah
