Just trying to sleep
Out on my deathbed
Been hungry for a week

Yeah, back to the Earth
Yeah, I wanna spend my days with you
Spend them all with you
I asked, "Why do we die?"
I asked, "Why do we die?"

Yeah, I'm tied to all the things I've done before
Yeah, I'm tied to all the things you've done before

Yeah, I think you're cool, I think you're radical
Yeah, I think you're cool, I think you're radical
Yeah, I think you're cool, I think you're radical
I think you're radical
