I got this passion for the inhumane
I am a firm believer in the malevolent
I leech you dry, gutted and alone, tormenting terror a terrific feast
Hellbent to subjugate you, desolate, devastate, damn their fate
Fucked by the beast

In my dark passion play
I invite you to stay and be lost in my maze
Make you feel so glorious until I
slay you down to size, I am the parasite

Why am I lost and broken?
Bleed for me, your life is mine
Here I am, vile and evil
Scream for me, your parasite

Terrified, terrorised, objectified and you're mine
My queen of screams all out of tears
You can't believe how this makes me
feel, this sickness is my sweet ordeal
Fucked by the beast

In my dark passion play
I invite you to stay and be lost in my maze
Make you feel so glorious until I
slay you down to size, I am the parasite

Why am I lost and broken?
Bleed for me, your life is mine
Here I am, vile and evil
Scream for me, your parasite

There is no escape, embrace of the vile, there is no escape
There is no escape, embrace of the vile, fear me now

Why am I lost and broken?
Bleed for me, your life is mine
Here I am, vile and evil
