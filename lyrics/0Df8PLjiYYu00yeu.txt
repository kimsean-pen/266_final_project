Too many things I'd rather do different
Woke up in a cold sweat, my emotions creepin'
Three o'clock on the weekend, might as well sleep in
Stay down for the count when, she hit me with the, "What-ifs?"
And the, "What-whens?" And the, "What-thens?"
Wonder where my life went, livin' in the moment
I been thinkin' 'bout my time spent, are the bills paid?
Is it make or break? Will I find a way?
Are my feelin's changed? Will I be okay? I don't know
But what I do know is, life don't make sense
If you can't pay rent, so I place my bet

What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away
You left a spell on my Saturday
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away
You left a spell on my Saturday

I got cracks in my phone screen
The past fuck with my psyche
Smoke weed and get high, please
Went to school in The Woodlands
And that made niggas wanna fight me
So I don't take threats lightly
Tell them niggas come and find me
Got his head in my eye view
New money, my perfume
Big smile, in a good mood
I been runnin' outta issues
I ain't trippin' when the rent due
I ain't runnin' with a pistol
I ain't locked in the system
Takin' care of my kinfolk

Takin' a book out the page of the graves
I'm only human and I make mistakes
Chisel my flows so they can't liberate
Talkin' the time as the pendulum sways
I gotta face what I didn't create
Just 'cause I can't relate, I don't debate
I educate, illuminate
Or we can't duplicate, no more movin' the plates
Second chances feelin' overrated
Unappreciated, so I bossed up
Missed the time when we could share space
But it'll all be straight the day we cross up
Nothin' better than some time with you
Because it's time I never wanna toss up
Lose myself inside of you, you find yourself in me
I don't wanna be cautious

What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away
You left a spell on my Saturday
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away
You left a spell on my Saturday

What got you shook?
What got you shook?
What got you shook?
What got you shook?
