They say that problems come
Come in pairs and I'm number one
So take a look at your friends, oh envy is a terrible thing

No you, you're so smart
So smart that you didn't call my bluff
Oh you should, should just run

If you run
If you run

If you run away you won't stay and that's so cold
Is it like you wanted it to? Are you scared?
Sing take it away, take it away
It's so easy to stay, easy to stay when you know everything

Stop, you had us all convinced
you were something, something you couldn't miss
But what did we really miss?

You say you'll give it up and you'll give it up all away
You'll give it up and you'll give it up all away
Give it up and give it up, give it away

If you run
If you run

If you run away you won't stay and that's so cold
Is it like you wanted it to? Are you scared?
Sing take it away, take it away
It's so easy to stay, easy to stay when you know everything

I've got one good reason to keep you on your feet
I've got another in the back, home in a seat
I've got one good reason to keep you on your feet
I've got another in the back, home in a seat

I've got one good reason to keep you on your feet
I've got another in the back, home in a seat
I've got one good reason to keep you on your feet
I've got another in the back, home in a seat

I've got one good reason to keep you on your feet
I've got another in the back, home in a seat
I've got one good reason to keep you on your feet
I've got another in the back, home in a seat

I've got one good reason to keep you on your feet
I've got another in the back, home in a seat
I've got one good reason to keep you on your feet
You're so cool

Run around, just running your mouth
About your hometown that's booing you now
But you're so cool, so cool

Run around, just running your mouth
About your hometown that's booing you now
But you're so cool, so cool
