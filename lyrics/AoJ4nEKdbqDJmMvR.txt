The grass is greener
The grass is greener

Been a good man
Been a good man all my life
Can't stand the feeling
I've been so hypnotized

Been a good man
Been a good man all my life
Can't stand the feeling
I've been so hypnotized

Ain't nobody gonna tell me how to live
Ain't nobody gonna tell me how to live
Ain't nobody gonna tell me how to live
Ain't nobody gonna tell me how to live

The grass is greener, greener on my side
You know you love the feeling
I've come to hypnotize

The grass is greener, greener on my side
You know you love the feeling
I've come to hypnotize

Ain't nobody gonna tell me how to live
Ain't nobody gonna tell me how to live
Ain't nobody gonna tell me how to live
Ain't nobody gonna tell me how to live

Been a good man
Been a good man
I've come to
I've come to hypnotize

Ain't nobody tell me how to live
Ain't nobody tell me how to live
Ain't nobody tell me how to live
Ain't nobody tell me how to live
