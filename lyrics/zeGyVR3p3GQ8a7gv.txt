One, two, three, four

Well she was just seventeen
You know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare

So how could I dance with another
Oh
When I saw her standing there

Well she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long

I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
Woo

When I saw her standing there
Well my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand

In mine
Well, we danced through the night

And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her

Now I'll never dance with another
Woo
Since I saw her standing there
Ahh
Ah, ah, ah

Well my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand
In mine
Ohh (Woaw)

We danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her

Now I'll never dance with another
Ooh
Since I saw her standing there
Whoa, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well since I saw her standing there.
