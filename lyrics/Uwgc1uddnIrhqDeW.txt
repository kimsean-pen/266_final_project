Savanna scatters and the seabird sings
So why should we fear what travel brings?
What were we hoping to get out of this?
Some kind of momentary bliss?

I waited for Something, and Something died
So I waited for Nothing, and Nothing arrived
It's our dearest ally, it's our closest friend
It's our darkest blackout, it's our final end
My dear sweet Nothing, let's start a new
From here all in is just me and you

I waited for Something and Something died
So I waited for Nothing, and Nothing arrived
Well I guess it's over, I guess it's begun
It's a losers' table, but we've already won
It's a funny battle, it's a constant game
I guess I was busy when Nothing came

I guess I was busy (when Nothing arrived)
I guess I was busy (when Nothing arrived)
I guess I was busy (when Nothing arrived)
I guess I was busy (when Nothing arrived)
I guess I was busy (when Nothing arrived)

I waited for Something and Something died
So I waited for Nothing, and Nothing arrived
I waited for Something and Something died
So I waited for Nothing, and Nothing arrived
