Telling me you don't want to be here
Had enough of life
I see your shoulders falling down the mountain
You once loved to climb
Don't you want to talk about it
Well saying there's no life left inside you

What about your loves
What about your dreams
What about the change tomorrow brings
What about the moonlight
What about the way you sigh
When it touches you

On your knees in the teeth of failure
It's got you gagged and bound
You say it's killing you but listen now I'm tellin' you
Your better days are to come
Set your sights on simple beauty
Like the way that my eyes shine when I'm around you

What about your loves
What about your dreams
What about the change tomorrow brings
What about the moonlight
What about the way you sigh
When it touches you

Nobody said it would be easy
To take the fall and stand
Just wrap your arms tight around me
And we'll stumble together, until we learn to dance

(What about your loves)
(What about your dreams)
(What about your loves)
(What about your dreams)

What about your loves
And what about your dreams
What about the change tomorrow brings
What about the moonlight
What about the way you sigh
When it touches you

What about your loves
And what about your dreams
What about the change tomorrow brings
What about the moonlight
What about the way you sigh
When it touches you

What about your loves
And what about your dreams
What about the change tomorrow brings
