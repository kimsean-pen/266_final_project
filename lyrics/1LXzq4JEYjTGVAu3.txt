It's time to strap our boots on
This is a perfect day to die
Wipe the blood out of our eyes
In this life there's no surrender
There's nothing left for us to do
Find the strength to see this through

We are the ones who will never be broken
With our final breath
We'll fight to the death
We are soldiers, we are soldiers

Whoa, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
We are soldiers

I stand here right beside you
Tonight we're fighting for our lives
Let me hear your battle cry
Your battle cry

We are the ones who will never be broken
With our final breath
We'll fight to the death
We are soldiers, we are soldiers
Yeah!

We stand shoulder to shoulder
We stand shoulder to shoulder
We stand shoulder to shoulder
You can't erase us, you'll just have to face us!

We stand shoulder to shoulder
We stand shoulder to shoulder
We stand shoulder to shoulder
You can't erase us, you'll just have to face us! (face us)

We are the ones who will never be broken (be broken)
With our final breath
We'll fight to the death
We are soldiers, we are soldiers
We are the ones who will not go unspoken
No, we will not sleep
We are not sheep
We are soldiers, we are soldiers
Yeah!

Whoa, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
We are soldiers
Whoa, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
We are Soldiers
