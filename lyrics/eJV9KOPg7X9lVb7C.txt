Hey don't worry I've been lied to
I've been here many times before
Girl don't you worry
I know where I stand
I don't need this love
I don't need your hand

I know I could turn blink and you'd be gone
Then I must be prepared anytime to carry on
But minute by minute by minute by minute
I keep holding on

(I'll be holding on) Oh now
(I'll be holding on...) Minute by minute by minute by minute
I keep holding on
Oh baby
You will stay just to watch me darlin'
Wilt away on lies from you
Can't stop the habit of livin' on the run

Take it all for granted like you're the only one
Livin' on my own
Somehow that sounds nice
You think I'm your fool

Well you may just be right
'Cause minute by minute by minute by minute
I keep holding on
(I'll be holding on)
Oh... yes I will

(I'll be holding on...) Minute by minute by minute by minute
I keep holding on
I keep holding on
Oh...
Call my name and I'll be gone
You'll reach out and I won't be there
Just my luck you'll realize
You should spend your life with someone
You could spend your life with someone
Minute by minute by minute by minute
I'll be holding on
Yeah-yeah now
Everyday
Minute by minute by minute by minute
I'll be holding on
Minute by minute by minute by minute
I'll be holding on
Don't you remember me
Yeah-yeah
Minute by minute by minute by minute
