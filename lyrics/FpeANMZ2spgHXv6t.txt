Human birds watch the sky
Where dark formations sail
Infecting the area of God
Jhva elohim meth

I am God creator of life
I am God enchanter of death
Death - that now marks you
Life - that slowly pass away

Screams of fear, dismembering the wind
Helpless souls drowning in pain
But storms of dawn...
A dawn without God

My spirit filled with hate sets free
The force of the golden dawn
Without God
Entomb your fear

The spirit is free
Jhva elohim meth
Satan laughs
Jhva elohim meth

I raise my fist
To the sky
Swear the ancient oath of black
The lambs shall bleed
Eternally bleed
God is dead and shall forever be
