Don't let me down
Hey, don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

Nobody ever loved me like she does
Oo she does, yes she does
And if somebody loved me like she do me
Oo she do me, you she does

Don't let me down
Hey, don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

I'm in love for the first time
Don't you know it's gonna last
It's a love that lasts forever
It's a love that had no past

Don't let me down
Hey, don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

And from the first time that she really done me
Oo she done me, she done me good
I guess nobody ever really done me
Oo she done me, she done me good

Don't let me down
Hey, don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

I'm in love for the first time
Don't you know it's gonna last
It's a love that lasts forever
It's a love that had no past

Don't let me down
Hey, don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Hey hey ah
Don't let me down
