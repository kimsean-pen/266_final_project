We're more than overwhelmed
By hundreds of hugs and a million good words

We are satisfied
From monday til friday and on sunday we cry

But we like it
From that point of view
So we stay here and bare until dawn everyday
And we stay here and bare everyday

We never ever lie
From ten in the morning
We are honest til nine
We are overcute
We never will manage to be rude only twice

But we like it from
that point of view
So we stay here and bare until dawn everyday
And we stay here and bare everyday
