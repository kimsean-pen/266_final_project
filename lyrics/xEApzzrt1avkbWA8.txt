Strangers just passing along
Lone horizon
You're taking me home
Nightfall
and nothing to lose
Sweet sensation
that you can't refuse
Take it inside
and play the song
Could you be loved
my number one

And we're in and out lost in mercury

Slow down if you want it last
We're quick like silver
always coming too fast
Won't you tell me wherever we are
Are we moving or getting far
After midnight
you're fading away
I'm heading home now
unless you want me to stay

And we're in and out lost in mercury
