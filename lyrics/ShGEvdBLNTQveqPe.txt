My achievements seem so humble
While you're making wine from water
While my hand work the cold soil
All you touch turns into gold
And I don't want to be like you

I don't want to be like you
It seems like you outrun me every time
I want to be you
Why can't I erase you from my mind

I don't want to be like you
It seems like you outrun me every time
I want to be you
Why can't I erase you from my mind

All the heroes in the gutter
Finally get their ever after
As they lay their final glance
Upon your ever shining armor
And I don't want to be like you

I don't want to be like you
It seems like you outrun me every time
I want to be you
Why can't I erase you from my mind

I don't want to be like you
It seems like you outrun me every time
I want to be you
Why can't I erase you from my mind

Looking from a distance
The difference seems so small
Has the grass been greener
On the other side at all?

I don't want to be like you
It seems like you outrun me every time
I want to be you
Why can't I erase you from my mind

I don't want to be like you
It seems like you outrun me every time
I want to be you
Why can't I erase you from my mind
