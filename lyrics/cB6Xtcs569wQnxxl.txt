Been running away so long, from the day
Into the strange night of stone to fade away
As the light is gently bleeding out of my soul
Penetrating the evening as I ride
on this endless road
But you can't turn back the time
It always gonna wait on the line
Some may wish never to be born
Wasting the dawn

Like a rose growing from the Christ's thorn
Wasting the dawn

Been waiting for you for so long
Little bird of prey
To fly me higher to the brighter day
Where the lizard lingers long

Under the sun
Forgetting the night, darkest July
Paris '71
But you can't turn back the time
It always gonna wait on the line
Some may wish never to be born
Wasting the dawn
Like a rose growing from the Christ's thorn
Wasting the dawn

Some may wish never to be born
Wasting the dawn

Like a rose growing from the Christ's thorn
Wasting the dawn
Some may wish never to be born
Wasting the dawn
Like a rose growing from the Christ's thorn
Wasting the dawn
Some may wish never to be born
Wasting the dawn

Like a rose growing from the Christ's thorn
Wasting the dawn
Some may wish never to be born
Wasting the dawn
Like a rose growing from the Christ's thorn
Wasting the dawn
Some may wish never to be born
Wasting the dawn
Like a rose growing from the Christ's thorn
They're all gonna waste the dawn
