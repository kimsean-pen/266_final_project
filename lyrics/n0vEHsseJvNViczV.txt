we see her in the night
creeping up behind
walking all alone
following her hope
and lights down low
no one will ever know
windows roll
it's dark and cold
but i'll turn right
and she jumps inside

we start to accelerate
slammin' on the brakes
i realise
she's been taken by surprise
so young and dumb
she never thought her time would come
now it's here
she's shaken with fear
they tip off the ride
putting their hands on her thighs

all her life
she never even cried
none would say
she chose the blame
