Oh, oh, oh, come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up and burn this floor
You know we getting hotter and hotter
Sexy and hotter, let's shut it down

Yo, what I gotta do to show these girls that I own them
Some call me Nicki and some call me Roman
Skeeza, pleeza, I'm in Ibiza, whoa
Giuseppe Zannotti my own sneaker

Sexy, sexy that's all I do
If you need a bad bitch, let me call a few
Pumps on and them little mini skirts is out
I see some good girls, I'm a turn 'em out

Okay, bottle, sip, bottle, guzzle
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle, hey
Bottle, sip, bottle, guzzle
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle, let's go

Music makes me high

Oh, oh, oh, come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up and burn this floor
You know we getting hotter and hotter
Sexy and hotter, let's shut it down

Pound the alarm!

Pound the alarm!

I wanna do it for the night, night
So get me now and knock this over
I wanna do it like you like, like
Come get me, baby, we're not getting younger

I just want you tonight, night
Baby, we won't do it for life, life, oh

Music makes me high

Oh, oh, oh, come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up and burn this floor
You know we getting hotter and hotter
Sexy and hotter, let's shut it down

Pound the alarm!

Pound the alarm!

The alarm!
The alarm!
The alarm!
The alarm!

Oh, oh, oh, come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up and burn this floor
You know we getting hotter and hotter
Sexy and hotter, let's shut it down

Pound the alarm!

Pound the alarm!

Pound the alarm!
