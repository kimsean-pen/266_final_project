Not a lot of patience, you're not a patient man
Don't have a heart to stay with you get it while you can
Just because you can, get out of it

And I wasted your time, didn't I
And that that's the reason we fight all the time
It's been so long since you've been a friend of mine

Gonna take a vacation, stop chasing what I lack
Am I gonna get blown off s soon as I get back
On another track without you?

'Cause I don't have the heart to try, one more false start in life
It's been so hard to get it right
Seems like the moment I catch up, the farther you fly

And I wasted your time, didn't I
And that that's the reason we fight all the time
It's been so long since you've been a friend of mine

And I wasted your time, didn't I
And that's the reason we fight all the time
It's been so long since you've been a friend to me
It seems like I dreamed and now I'm waking up to daylight
What happened, when did you let go of me?
I miss you so badly

It's been so long since you've been a friend of mine
