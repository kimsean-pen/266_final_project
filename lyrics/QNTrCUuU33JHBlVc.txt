Forcefeed them your ways
Dictate up a blinded swarm
Society's afraid

Declaration of rebellion
We will not stand defeat

Deconstructing their hold
Our vengeance will be tenfold
Deconstructing their hold
Our vengeance will be tenfold
Our enemies will be drowned
The opposing torn asunder

Take all your lives back
Arson to all they create
The time is now to lead the battle

Declaration of rebellion
We will not stand defeat

Deconstructing their hold
Our vengeance will be tenfold
Deconstructing their hold
Our vengeance will be tenfold
Our enemies will be drowned
The opposing torn asunder

Deconstructing their hold
Our vengeance will be tenfold
Deconstructing their hold
Our vengeance will be tenfold
Our enemies will be drowned
The opposing torn asunder
Our enemies will be drowned
The opposing torn asunder
