The fastest running patient
I've swept them all away
Swept up in the piss, I held a fist of pretty pearls
The vapors in my system
I'm running towards the day
No sleep here within ages
We push the means away

The patient turns and cries
I turn back, I'm laughing again

Losing focus on the reason
Just look to settle scores
Crept up in the mist, I spun the mess in other worlds
What creeps up in my system
I'm running far away
Too deep to turn the pages
And kill the days at play

The patient turns and cries
I turn back, I'm laughing again
