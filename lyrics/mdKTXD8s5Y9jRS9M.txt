Little lists and scraps that keep me moving
Another meal and play that song to pick you up
Over time you think the days lose colour
Don't sound tired by the promises

All in all there's something missing
All in all there's something you can do
I won't play it down or pretend I haven't found
Because all in all there's something in you

You took me in when I couldn't run anymore
See all hands pointed to a faded high
Those greying eyes, need new air, new life
For you to see again with your head held high

All in all there's so much missing
All in all there's nothing you can do
I won't play it down or pretend I haven't found
Because all in all there's something in you
All in all there's something in you

I forgot where I was
Don't answer me
Help me stay close
There's one little part of me
That doesn't want to let go
It's easier to be the old me
I'm tired of staring down the price of bravery
In the most adventurous gloom
Let them fight it out and Ô¨Ånd you

Off you go
Make rain and thunder again
You can carry yourself
You've seen all this sky
This frontier, only your footprints were real
And tonight I'll be your friend
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
A stray 'til the end
