I remember your song
And the way you sang it to me
So many times in other forms
On distant lands

I remember your smile
And the way you sent it to me
So many times through different air
It lives inside my heart

It is a dream, you me
Is it a dream?
It can't be real
I never felt a wind
So happy, so warm
It can't be real
Sent seven little red birds up my spine
I never felt a wind
So happy, so warm
That sent seven little red birds up my spine
Singing

Shoebab, shoebab shoebab shoebab
Shoebab shoebab shoebab
Shoebab shoebab shoebab
Shoebab shoebab shoebab
