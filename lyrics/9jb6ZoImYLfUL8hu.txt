I can't help if the world is going crazy
And the headlines get more frightening everyday
Just as long as I'm in there with you baby
It's okay, it's okay

Give me your love
Give me more than enough
Oh baby I need you now... x3

I don't usually talk about my feelings
But with you there's such a lot I want to say
And as long as your the one that I believe in
It's okay, it's okay

Give me your love
Give me more than enough
Oh baby I need you now... x4

And as long as your the one that I believe in
It's okay, it's okay

Give me your love
Give me more than enough
Oh baby I need you now... x8
