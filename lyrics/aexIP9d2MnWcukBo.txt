Roll the windows down
Now turn your stereo up
Because tonight-tonight we don't give two f*cks
Caution to the wind
And they're gonna see
No matter what they play
We're gonna live free

Now put your hands in the air
And waive them round like you just don't give a uh
Just don't give a uh
Now put your hands in the air
Put your hand in the air
Here we go yeah!

Kishi kaisei
Kishi kishi kaisei c'mon
Kishi kaisei
Kishi kishi kaisei c'mon

Let the sunshine in
And let the light shine bright
Feel the power within
Because tonight's the night
Let the good times roll
Open heart and free
No matter what they play
We're gonna dance free

Now put your hands in the air
And waive them round like you just don't give a uh
Just don't give a uh
Now put your hands in the air
Put your hand in the air
