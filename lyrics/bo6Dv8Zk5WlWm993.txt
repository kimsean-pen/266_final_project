A million ghosts, I hid them
I hope you don't despise me
I begged you to let me in
Now I know, now I know

I wanted to be something that I'm just not
A thousand lies, a thousand lies
We're swimming in the ocean but at whose cost?
We will die, we will die
Well I've been told the melody lingers on
How can I? How can I?
I see you and I see someone I knew before
But who am I, who am I, who am I?

Who am I, who am I?
Who am I, who am I?
