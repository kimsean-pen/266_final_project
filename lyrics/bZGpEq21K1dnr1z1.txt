We're caught up in silence
I lose you in degrees
I see you through a glass wall

I've looked all up and down now
But lose you in degrees
Come back around my way again
See me if you please
But we're tongue-tied in silence
Our words lost on the breeze
Caught up in your armistice
Release me if you please

I lose you in degrees
Don't leave me on my knees
I lose you in degrees
Only me on my knees
I lose you in degrees
Don't leave me on my knees
I lose you in degrees
Only me on my knees

I saw the black rain pouring
A lost love on display
Bit by bit and day by day
I know we've lost our way
And I hear final footsteps
Lost you by degrees
I pressed up to the glass wall
I couldn't watch you leave

I lose you in degrees
Don't leave me on my knees
I lose you in degrees
Only me on my knees
I lose you in degrees
Don't leave me on my knees
I lose you in degrees
Only me on my knees

Around again
I've waste my days
Around again
I waste my time
Oh, I know I've wasted time (Around again)
When I've tried to please, yeah (Waste my days)
How did I end up here (Around again)
Where I've come to be, yeah? (Waste my time)
Oh, I see I've wasted time (Around again)
When I've tried to please, yeah (Waste my time)
Miss me when I waste my time (Around again)
Where I've come to be, yeah

Am I wasting my time
I could not persevere
Am I wasting my time
I could not persevere
Am I wasting my time
I could not persevere
Am I wasting my time
I could not persevere
Am I wasting my time
I could not persevere
Am I wasting my time
I could not persevere
Am I wasting my time
I could not persevere
Am I wasting my time
I could not persevere
Am I wasting my time
I could not persevere

Don't go wasting my time
I could not persevere
Don't go wasting my time
I could not persevere
Don't go wasting my time
I could not persevere
No more wasting my time
How can I persevere?
No more wasting my time
How can I persevere?
No more wasting my time
How can I persevere?
No more wasting my time
How can I persevere?
