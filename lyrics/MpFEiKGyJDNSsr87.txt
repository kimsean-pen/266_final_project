I'm so unispired
Tell me how long 'til we meet again
'Cause how I long to get you undressed
Let's just get right down to it

And if I'm uninvited
I hope you know that I'm coming anyway
I want that high that you give to me
Time is too precious to waste

And I need to get some of your L.O.V.E
To write me another song
When my mind has started runnin' low
I need a taste of your, taste of your love

And I need to get some of your L.O.V.E
Just hold me like I'm really yours
That's what we make it for
La-la-la-la-la-la-love

So I might confess it
I live from one of your kisses to the next
'Cause your touch is heaven sense
And I know that, I know that I'm

A loveaholic
And I don't give a damn about what people say
I'm gonna make love to you anyway
'Cause time is too precious to waste

And I need to get some of your L.O.V.E
To write me another song
When my mind has started runnin' low
I need a taste of your, taste of your love

And I need to get some of your L.O.V.E
Just hold me like I'm really yours
That's what we make it for
La-la-la-la-la-la-love

And I can't help it (help it)
I won't change it (change it)
It's my calling from up above
I'm gonna give you all the love I've got
La-la-la-la-la-la-love

L.O.V.E
To write me another song
When my mind has started runnin' low
I need a taste of your, taste of your love
And I need to get some of your L.O.V.E
Just hold me like I'm really yours
That's what we make it for
La-la-la-la-la-la-love
