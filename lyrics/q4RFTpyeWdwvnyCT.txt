Felt like we had been that age for so long
We could never agree
I don't know what you call that
So you packed up all my stuff
Said you go do what you want
But you know when you're young
It's like that when you're younger

It's been so long
As soon as I get myself some savings
I'm flying out to see ya
Work so hard, I swear
Sometimes it's not so easy
To be gone this time of year
(Oh come on)

Oh, I wish
Oh, I wanted to say I miss ya
Oh, this time of year

Suddenly I felt those old days fading
Was there ever a reason?
Was there ever a big deal?
So I got myself a ride
Drove due south on 55
But you know when you're young
When you're young you can fall out of touch

It's been so long
As soon as I get myself some savings
I'm flying out to see ya
Work so hard, I swear
Sometimes it's not so easy
To be gone this time of year
(Oh come on)

Oh, I wish
Oh, I wanted to say I miss ya
Oh, this time of year

(Oh I really miss you this time of year)
Yeah I don't really care what you tell me
(Oh I really miss you this time of year)
You say [?]
(Oh I really miss you this time of year)
Keep sayin' that you don't know me
(Oh I really miss you this time of year)

Don't maker choose
'Cause that's what they want you to do
'Cause that's when you lose
All I have to say is it's true, true, true
Don't make me choose
'Cause that's what they want you to do
'Cause that's when you lose
All I have to say is it's true, true, true

Been so long
As soon as I get myself some savings
I'm flying out to see ya
Work so hard, I swear
Sometimes it's not so easy
To be gone this time of year

Oh, I wish
Oh, I wanted to say I miss ya
(Oh, I really do)
Oh, this time of year
(Come on)

Oh, I wish
Oh, I wanted to say I miss ya
Oh, this time of year
(Oh, this time)

And I've been waiting for all this, all this time
All this, all this time
All this, all this, all this time yeah
