Henrietta, we got no flowers for you
Just these three miserable cunts
Sitting on the back seat
Turning on the off beat

We know you love us, and you probably do
Although your husband may cut us
He's an animal
Though everything is possible

Give us a kiss and maybe we can go out
It's hard to miss you when you follow us abou-ou-ou-out
Buy us some shoes, and maybe take us for cola
We'll get you there in some filthy big gondola, and it's

Clean out the bank and bump off your daddy
You can come live with us amongst the has-beens and the addicts
These are crazy times down at Costello music
You can answer the phone and talk anyway you choose it, come on

Oh, come on
Oh, come on

A-wa-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahhh!
Wo-hoo-hoo-hoooo!

Dear Henrietta, we're just three lonely boys
Though the girls love us we're so
Into you incredibly
We'd love to see you terribly

We'd love to hate you, but we don't have no choice
Come be our wa ha ha ha
Honey, honey three four
One time once more

Give us a kiss and maybe we can go out
It's hard to miss you when you follow us abou-ou-ou-out
Buy us some shoes and maybe take us for cola
We'll get you there in some filthy big gondola, and it's

Clean out the bank and bump off your daddy
You can come live with us amongst the has-beens and the addicts
These are crazy times down at Costello music
You can answer the phone and talk anyway you choose it, come on

Wuh-wah-wah-waahhh
Wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh

Wuh-wah-wah-waahhh
Wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh

Clean out the bank and bump off your daddy
You can come live with us amongst the has-beens and the addicts
These are crazy times down at Costello music
You can answer the phone and talk anyway you choose it, come on
Clean out the bank and bump off your daddy
You can come live with us amongst the has-beens and the addicts
These are crazy times down at Costello music
You can answer the phone and talk anyway you choose it, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Wa-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
