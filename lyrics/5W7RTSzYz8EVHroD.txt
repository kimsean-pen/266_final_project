Gonna take you off my list of to-dos
Gonna sing my soul
Shake off these blues
'Cause it's alright, it's alright now
When I wake up and I
Hear you say
There's no love worth chasing yesterday
'Cause it's alright, it's alright now

Yes I know
I've been bold
I didn't do what I was told
Yes I know
You soft soap
You didn't do what I was told

I ain't looking for you nine to five
I'm sick of wasting my sweet, precious time
'Cause it's alright, it's alright now

Yes I know
I've been bold
I didn't do what I was told
Yes I know
You sound so
You didn't do what I was told

Lay it on me
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, yeah

Lay it on me
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, yeah

Lay it on me
Lay it on me, yeah
Lay it on me, oh yeah
Lay it on me
Lay it on me, yeah
Lay it on me, oh yeah

Yes I know
I've been bold
I didn't do what I was told
Yes I know
You sound so
You didn't do what I was told

Yes I know
I've been bold
I didn't do what I was told
Yes I know
You sound so
You didn't do what I was told
