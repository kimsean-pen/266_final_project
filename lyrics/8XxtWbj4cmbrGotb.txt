It took me years to find
True mind at peace
And now you treat me like
They approve me
You're my poem, yes you know
Yet you stole my way
Just to know this, you told me
You were late
When you would call, I would hold
And I still remain
Then you led me to believe that's what you wanted

Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away
Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away

True love, but I'd see you
Treat me more like you
And I'd try to heal it
But I feel so thrown back
Take my hand, in the cold
In the snow, but you do not break
But they told you, convinced you
Think I'd play
But I know myself better than you do

Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away
Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away

May, May calling slow
Finally in a dress that meant money in the bank
Drinking hard so you can't feel the warmth of the arms
So you dreamt, fade away
Take my hand, I paid my fine
In the park, in the dark, when you said my name
On the bench, when I felt that you smiled
And you said there, that child

Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away
Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away
Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away
Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away
