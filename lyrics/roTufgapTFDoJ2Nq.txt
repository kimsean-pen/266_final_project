Its the morning, its sets on the river
She been away from a while
That plug its fresh make it easy what you got
Since so many girls, since so many days
Its so crowd in the same place
Ooh its here and we gonn ago
Cuz your heart I rather
Its a hit of call, its the last game
And it goes crazy
That probably change in the background
Shes a lead, since so many blows
Since so many in some many ways
Oh dont be afraid
Cuz no one I wanna
No .we gonna be ok
Cuz not tomorrow
Our mother ash, our mother Ash
Dreams will fall, hit on the ground
Dreams will fall, hit on the ground
Dreams will fall, hit on the ground
Get on the ground, get on the ground
This is to blow me all that
Cuz no other I rather chose
Dont .gonna be arrange
Our mother Ash
