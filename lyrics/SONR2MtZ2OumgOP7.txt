Passed the rolling shore
I have nothing left to give
Chasing all the words
Everything you say I wanna see
But honestly it's fine
When I mention I love you
Even though it's strange
Have the cold to keep
I'm not sure I still believe
Of course it's not for more
Than a place we've been before
Telling you I'll try not to keep you there inside
I want nothing more to die
A little bit of shame
Make sure your sense is truly gone
Still there, still as you were
At the end of the line
It feels as if there's no time at all
Every pleasure burned to the wind
Quiet pictures drawn each day before it ends
To remind me once again
