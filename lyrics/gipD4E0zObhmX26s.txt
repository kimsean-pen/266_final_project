Faintly I'll go
to take this
head on
Soon i'll come around
Lost and never found
Waiting for my words
Seen but never heard
Buried underground
But i'll keep coming
Wipe those
tears off
And make your
heart proud
Soon I'll come around
Lost and never found
Waiting for my words
Seen but never heard
Buried underground
But I'll keep coming
But I'll keep coming
But I'll keep coming
But I'll keep coming
But I'll keep coming
But I'll keep coming
But I'll keep coming
But I'll keep coming
But I'll keep coming
