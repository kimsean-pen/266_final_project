Baby, I'll behave
If you let me stay
Please don't say
That I'm begging you for love
Baby, let me stay
When the world is gone
Promise I'll behave
Never right you wrong
Is that what you want
Like the other boys?
Someone you can throw
Like the other toys?

Is that what you found
Like the other boys
Someone you can drown
Like the other noise?!

Baby, I'll behave
If you let me stay.
Please don't say
That I'm begging you for love.
