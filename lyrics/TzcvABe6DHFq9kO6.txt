Tell me what you wanna do
I probably wanna do it too
Tell me how you really feel
Is it real good for you?
I can't get you off my mind
I think about you all the time
But maybe I'm the only one
Maybe you're just having fun

I probably shouldn't sleep over
'Cause I know that I'm making it worse
I freak out every time we get closer
'Cause I'm scared that it's just gonna hurt
And I even like you when I'm sober
Honestly, that's a first
I freak out every time we get closer
'Cause I'm scared that it's just gonna hurt
'Cause I'm scared that it's just gonna hurt
'Cause I'm scared that it's just gonna hurt

I can't get you out my head
I can't get you out my bed
Maybe I should walk away
'Cause I'm afraid, our hearts isolate
But I couldn't even if I tried
'Cause you're the only thing that feels right
And you keep on giving me them eyes
You know I'm gonna, gonna stay the night

I probably shouldn't sleep over
'Cause I know that I'm making it worse
I freak out every time we get closer
'Cause I'm scared that it's just gonna hurt
And I even like you when I'm sober
Honestly, that's a first
I freak out every time we get closer
'Cause I'm scared that it's just gonna hurt
'Cause I'm scared that it's just gonna hurt
'Cause I'm scared that it's just gonna hurt

Tell me what you wanna do
I probably wanna do it too
Tell me how you really feel
Is it real good for you?

I probably shouldn't sleep over
'Cause I'm scared that it's just gonna hurt
