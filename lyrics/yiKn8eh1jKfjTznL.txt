When I'm overwhelmed I go to my bed
There's a giant cloud that sits above my head
Maybe I'll sleep it all away
Close my eyes so life brings a new day

Baby I'm so sorry
I'm trying my best to figure this out
I swear that I'm so happy
Cause crying won't fix what's already broken and dead

Just give me some time
Give me some time

All of this comes down to me and you
Forget all things that she put you through
Do you feel the same way?
Close my eyes, still life brings a new day

Baby I'm so sorry
I'm trying my best to figure this out
I swear that I'm so happy
Cause crying won't fix what's already broken and dead

Just give me some time...
