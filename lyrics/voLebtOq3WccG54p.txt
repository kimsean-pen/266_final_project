It's the frightened face of a stupid mistake
That get you down (d-down, down)
It's the rising of cheats
Driving from the backseat
That stress you out
And get you down, down, down

Your fault, not your fault
It's not your fault, not your fault
I got your back, got your back like that
No need to worry

Hey now, hey now
Sometimes people suck
I know it's all over in a minute
Pretty soon you'll forget it
Hey now, hey now
Sometimes people suck
I know it's already been a minute
Hey now, hey now

Cheers to all of the schmuck's tryna take what you got
And let them go, let them go
A middle finger salute to the names that hurt you
Hey, I know, just let it go, go, go

Your fault, not your fault
It's not your fault, not your fault
I got your back, got your back like that
No need to worry

Hey now, hey now
Sometimes people suck
I know it's all over in a minute
Pretty soon you'll forget it
Hey now, hey now
Sometimes people suck
I know it's already been a minute
Hey now, hey now

Hey now, hey now
Sometimes people suck
I know it's all over in a minute
Pretty soon you'll forget it
Hey now, hey now
Sometimes people suck
I know it's already been a minute
Hey now, hey now

Hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now
Sometimes people suck, I know
Hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now
Sometimes people suck, I know
