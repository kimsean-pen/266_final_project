Look at Earth from outer space
Everyone must find a place
Give me time and give me space
Give me real, don't give me fake

Give me strength, reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Give me time, give us a kiss
And tell me your own politik

And open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes

Give me one cause one is best
In confusion, confidence
Give me piece of mind and trust
But don't forget the rest of us

Give me strength, reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Wounds that heal and cracks that fix
Tell me your own politik

And open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Just open up your eyes

And give me love over
Love over
Love over this
(Aah-aah)
And give me love over
Love over
Love over this
(Aah-aah-aah)
