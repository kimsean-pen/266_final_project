In my last years with him there were bruises on my face
In my dawn and new day, I finally got away
But my head's all messed up and he knows just what to say
No more dawn and new days, I'm goin' back to stay
So why say bye-bye?
When it only makes me cry
I still light up like a candle burnin' when he calls me up
I still melt down like a candle burnin' every time we touch
Oh, say what you will, he does me wrong and I should be gone
But I still be lovin' you baby and it's much too much
We are going down 'cuz you're always getting high
And your crumbs of lovin' no longer get me by
Wow, it gets better every time that we get high
Then your crumbs of lovin' they somehow get me by
Why say bye-bye?
When it only makes me cry
I still light up like a candle burnin' when he calls me up
I still melt down like a candle burnin' every time we touch
I still light up like a candle burnin' when he calls me up
I still melt down like a candle burnin' every time we touch
Oh, say what you will, he does me wrong and I should be gone
But I still be lovin', you baby and it's much too much
And I can't go my severed way?
Some rain for my sunny day
Not even one reason to stay
Why I should've left you?
And why I can't forget you baby?
Why? Ever since I met you it's why, still
Light up like a candle burnin' when he calls me up
Melt down like a candle burnin' every time we touch
Light up like a candle burnin' when he calls me up
Melt down like a candle burnin' every time we touch
Oh, say what you will, he does me wrong and I should be gone
And I still be lovin' you baby and it's much too much
