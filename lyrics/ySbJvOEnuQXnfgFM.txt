You sure know how to hurt a girl
Fewer hugs and no more kisses
Just water for your carburetor
And bearings for your pistons

Rev her engine for your pleasure
Caress and fondle her steering wheel
But when you moan and hug her gear shift
Stop! Think how it makes me feel

Oh, skidmarks on my heart
You've got me in fifth
You're burning rubber like my love

Oh, skidmarks on my heart
You've got me in fifth
You're burning rubber like my love

Spend all your time and money
On that Pontiac GTO pile
Getting tired of your greasy antics
My pride's getting hurt by the mile

Blow her engine, blow my mind
Keep her shocks and brakes aligned
I see that you're all jacked up
Leaving me and your exhaust behind

Oh, skidmarks on my heart
You've got me in fifth
You're burning rubber like my love

Oh, skidmarks on my heart
You've got me in fifth
You're burning rubber like my love

One, two, three, four

I buy you cologne
You want to axle grease
You say, "Get a mechanic"
I say, "Get a shrink"

I need promises
You need Motor Trend
Our love needs an overhaul
Or this is may be the end

Oh, skidmarks on my heart
You've got me in fifth
You're burning rubber like my love

Oh, skidmarks on my heart
You've got me in fifth
You're burning rubber like my love

I'm driving in risk
I'm driving in risk
I'm driving in risk
I'm driving in risk
