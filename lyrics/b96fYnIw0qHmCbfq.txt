IT'S TIME TO INVADE!
The bay of PIGS!
They're out for blood tonight, they're the widow-makers
Killer Elite: Cuba Invaders
A Motley Crew in the line of fire
A raging horde of criminal pilgrims

Murder patrol of heavy drug addicts
Burning wheel on the road to ruin
THIS IS THE DARK CHAPTER OF FREEDOM

BUT NO ONE CARES, WHERE IS THE READER, NOW?
THE WORDS ARE GONE SOMEHOW BUT I JUST CAN'T TAKE IT SO
Break the chains one final time
Well see you on the other side
The Revolutions bound to fail
And God is on you side
They aimed to take the residence
Left buy their own president

Failure is what people say

About the Bay Of Pigs
THE BAY OF PIGS
THE BAY OF PIGS!
So have you seen the news.
Have you felt desire
The Lust to kill to turn on the pyre
Tell me son: Do you even bother?

Sometimes drives me mad that I don't know
The Secred Script to the question of our lives
Please don't say that I am a liar
You know.

Back in the days the remembered the world war

It was for real and just like a time bomb
Why can't we find another way
These boys were on top so:

Break the chains one final time
We'll see you on the other side
The revolutions bound to fail
And God is on your side
They aimed to take the residence
But left by their own president
Failure is what people say
About the Bay of Pigs
...Awesomeness...
This is the dark side of the story
ers of greed power horny
Ooooohhh...
Let's find another war
You better break the chains one final time
We'll see you on the other side
The revolutions bound to fail
And God is on your side
They aimed to take the residence
But left by their own president
Failure is what people say
About the Bay of Pigs
The Bay of PIGS
PIGS!
PIGS!!
The bay of PIGS!
PIGS!
PIGS!!
