I never took you for a trick but sometimes I don't know what you want
I can take it if you need to take this out on someone

That little bitch with her head held so high
talking shit when I cut myself so I could feel something I know is not a lie

That one stings a little
I'm always in the middle
I don't expect but try me
And you will always find me here
This is where I scream from

You can take it all away and I'll miss
There's a little bit of you in all this
And you can say you only think you know, yeah
Please, there's a better bit of me to see yet
Cause you haven't seen any of my best
You know I hate myself without you now

ya, Hurts the same when nobody knows
I guess that's just how it goes
And I won't say anything at all

I was talking on a dollar sign
anxious, scared of what you need
Everybody wants a piece of you
Everyone takes a piece of me

That one stings a little
I'm always in the middle
I don't expect but try me
And you will always find me here
This is where I scream from

ya, You can take it all away and I'll miss

There's a little bit of you in all this
And you can say you only think you know, yeah
Please, there's a better bit of me to see yet
Cause you haven't seen any of my best
You know I hate myself without you now

ya, Hurts the same when nobody knows
I guess that's just how it goes
And I won't say anything at all

This is the Take it like you took
I'm shaking like I sbefore
Never ever getting better off
and I can only watch
This is where I stopped before
Not another piece of me
I always slip away from
I always slip away from

I won't say anything but
ya, You can take it all away and I'll miss
There's a little bit of you in all this
And you can say you only think you know, yeah
Please, there's a better bit of me to see yet
Cause you haven't seen any of my best
You know I hate myself
Hurts the same when nobody knows
I guess that's just how it goes
And I won't say anything at all
I won't say anything at all
I won't say anything at all
