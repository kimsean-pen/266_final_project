Does history guide you or do you set out to change it?
Breached, not broken
Breached, not broken

Do you set out to change me?
Thank you for that, you giant human rat

Fuck your skinned-alive designer wear
Fashion shades and salon hair
Heels to help where nature failed
Artificial teeth and nails

The wasp's nest expands
So, clap your hands
It's her, the one black woman who's success, you don't credit to Affirmative Action
The way of the future is corporate sponsors raising your kids
Maternal love is nothing compared to what seven dollars gives

Put in, suck out plastic body parts
It's the ever-growing industry of cosmetic arts
Bombarded with the idealized shots
Dysmorphic, self-destructive plots

Physical flaws are a mental blank, a mental blank
Physical flaws are a mental blank
So pay your surgeons, it's your parents who you should thank

These eyes are blind to several hundred left behind (lest we forget again)
But the border is breached but not broken
Who tries to find the several hundred left behind
When the border is breached but not broken?

Co-existing in a twisted society
Where youth is a crime and wasteful sweat-shop expenditures is how luxury is defined
Now the KKK has found a new masquerade
Fuck your self-proclaimed supremacy, you hide your face and your shame

Identify right and wrong when all fact is merely opinion
You cannot know the sweetness of victory without first dwelling in the agony of defeat

These eyes are blind to several hundred left behind (lest we forget again)
But the border is breached but not broken
Who tries (who tries) to find the several hundred left behind
But the border is breached, the border is breached, the border

These eyes are blind to several hundred left behind
We forgot again
