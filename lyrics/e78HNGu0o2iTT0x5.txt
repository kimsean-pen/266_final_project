Why don't we... Why don't we
Why don't we... Why don't we
Take me away
Release me from the cage
Free me from the pain
And let me feel no shame

The stars spin circles around the bad times
You splashed your water on my fire sign
The fortune teller told us to unwind
Come on run away

Runaway... Runaway... Runaway
Why don't we
Why don't we

I've felt invisible for a long time
This town will smother what's left of mine
Untaken chances come back to life
Come on run away

Runaway... Runaway... Runaway
I've been I've been all
I've been I've been all
I've been I've been all around the world dream
Let's go free... Let's go free
Why don't we... Why don't we

You've been saying that you want to go
I'm finally ready to let go
Let's go... Let's go... Let's go
I am finally ready

Take me away
Release me from the cage
Free me from the pain
And let me feel no shame

Let's go free... Let's go free
Runaway
