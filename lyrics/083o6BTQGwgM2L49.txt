And we sing this morning that wonderful and grand old message.
Well, I don't know about you, but I never get tired about it
Number 99: Just as I am.

I'm a mountain that has been moved
I'm a river that is all dried up
I'm an ocean nothing floats on
I'm a sky that nothing wants to fly in

I'm a sun that doesn't burn hot
I'm a moon that never shows its face
I'm a mouth that doesn't smile
I'm a word that no one ever wants to say

I don't wanna be
He wasn't finding anybody when he was on a shelf
I saw him in my dream

I'm a mountain that has been moved
I'm a fugitive that has no legs to run
I'm a preacher with no pulpit
Spewing a sermon that goes on and on

Well if we take all these things and we bury the past
And we'll pray that they turn to seeds, to roots and then grass
It'd be all right, it's all right
It'd be easier that way

Or if the sky opened up and started pouring rain
Like he knew it was time to start things over again
It'd be all right, it's all right
It'd be easier that way

(Don't mean a thing)
Well if we take all these things and we bury the past
(But you won't go in the ground)
And we'll pray that they turn into seeds, to roots and then grass
(You won't take steps towads the light)
It'd be all right, it's all right
(Feel the flow)
It'd be easier that way

(Don't say you won't get scared and leave)
Or if the sky opened up and started pouring rain
(And don't you mention all the good there would be)
Like he knew it was time to start things over again
(Don't say he's alone)
It'd be all right, it's all right
(Feel the flow)
It'd be easier that way
