Kiss today goodbye
The sweetness and the sorrow
Wish me luck, the same to you
But I can't regret
What I did for love, what I did for love

Look, my eyes are dry
The gift was ours to borrow
Oh, it's as if we always knew
And I won't forget
What I did for love, what I did for love

Gone
Love is never gone
As we travel on
Love's what we'll remember

Kiss today goodbye
And point me t'ward tomorrow
We did what we had to do
Won't forget, can't regret
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love

Love is never gone
As we travel on
Love's what we'll remember

Kiss today good bye
And point me t'ward tomorrow
Oh, we did what we had to do
Won't forget, can't regret
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love

Love is never gone
As we travel on
Love's what we'll remember

Kiss today good bye
And point me t'ward tomorrow
Oh, we did what we had to do
Won't forget, can't regret
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
