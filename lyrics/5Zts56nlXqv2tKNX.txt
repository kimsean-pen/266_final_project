Hoo hoo hoo hoo laa
Mmm hmm
Hey hey hey yea
Hey

If you ever, ever leave me
Life would go on, stars would still be
Bright as diamonds in the sky now
Even if you say goodbye now

Ohh, hoo

The clock wouldn't stop, no
That sun would still keep shinnin' down
Down the end

This world would still be spinnin' round
But baby, there would be

Just, no livin' without loving you
How would I ever survive?
Just, no livin' without loving you
It would be like livin' without being alive
Without you

(Just, no living without loving you)
Without you
Without

If you ever walk out this door

What would I have left to live for?
What would there be left to do now?
What would I be without you now?
Ohh ooo ahh, ahh

The clock wouldn't stop, no
Each day would go on just the same
Down the end
It wouldn't stop the sun and rain
But baby, there would be

Just, no living without loving you
How would I ever survive?
Just, no living without loving you
Would be like living without being alive, without you
(Just, no living without loving you)
Without you, baby
Ohh hoo hoo yea

Without you
(Just, no living without loving you)

There is no living without loving you
Oh baby in my love
(Just, no living without loving you)
Oh Just everywhere you, you oh baby

Woh, the clock wouldn't stop, no
But, baby there would be

Just, no living without loving you
How would I ever survive?
Just, no living without loving you
Would be like living without being alive, without you
(Just, no living without loving you)
Without you, hoo, baby
(Just, no living without loving you)
It would be like living without being alive, without you
(Just, no living without loving you)
Oh yes baby
There's no living, without loving you
There's no living
(Just, no living without loving you)
Oh, baby
There is no living, yea
Oh no, oh no, oh no, yea
(Just, no living without loving you)
I'm loving you
How could I ever survive?
(Just, no living without loving you)
Baby, my baby, ahh, haa
There's no living without loving you
(Just, no living without loving you)
(Baby, baby)
There's no living without loving you
(Just, no living without loving you)
(Baby, baby)
Ahh, there's no living without loving you
(Just, no living without loving you)
(Baby)
Ahh hoo hoo
There is no living without loving you
There is no living, living, living
(Just, no living without loving you)
I'm loving you
