Here's a song from an open mind
I give it to you because I can
and if you're thinking that it's not that kind
it cause my mood swings
make me feel ashamed
it can pass the time

a girl with eyes that see a hundred years
half remembered, this is my dream
spinning out from where the hole appears
I've never seen her
but I've got photographs
it can blow your mind

an idea falls from a porcelain sky
it won't make you rich
and it won't get you high

(out of the)
out of the void it comes
from an open mind
(out of the)
out of the void it comes
it comes from my mind
