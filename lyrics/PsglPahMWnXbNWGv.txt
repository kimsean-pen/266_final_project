Sons and daughters, there's no progress
Songs of hardship reach our hearts
Our scales will fall, we wait for dawn
And hope to break the radio silence

Sons and daughters, there's no progress
Songs of hardship reach our hearts
Our scales will fall, we wait for dawn
And hope to break the radio silence
