I hear the moment
I remember and I see
Forgiveness
I take a listen
All the things that we believe
Forgiveness

Run to the water
To remember what you see
Forgiveness
Know what you're thinking
We will always be the same
Forgiveness

Another minute 'til you go away
Now you can get it wrong
Another minute 'til the medal hall
Before you see your soul
Another minute 'til you walk away

Run to the water
To remember what you see
Forgiveness
Know what you're thinking
We will always be the same
Forgiveness

You and I, fall into my arms
You and I, fall into my arms
You and I, fall into my arms
And I give you forgiveness
You and I, fall into my arms
You and I, fall into my arms

Forgiveness
Forgiveness
