I went and turned it off, I'm not finished
I tried to stitch it shut, I wasn't finished
Please, please, please beat me to pieces
I'll never cry again, Bludgeon me senseless

For the friend in my head, let's endlessly talk
For the love of god, make him stop

Fill me with pain, I've had enough

Spill me, Wipe me up and ring me out again

Now the blood moon is bawling it's eyes out
And my friend in the dark dances on

I'm not even there
No I'm not even there

Everybody wants a piece of me
Cut me up taste my misery
How come nobody wants of piece of me
Stitch me up to fix my agony

Spill me. Wipe me up and ring me out again

Cut me open
I'm not even there
Spill my insides
I'm not even there
Stitch me up and fix my everything again
No I'm not even there

Everybody wants a piece of me
Stitch me up and fix my misery
How come nobody wants of piece of me?
This schizophrenia's got me bawling my eyes out

This blood moon, it's got me bawling my eyes out
Please, please, please beat me to pieces
But now i'm bawling my eyes out
I'm not finished
