I can't see because I'm staring at a blank wall
I can't breathe because my fucking thoughts are choking me now
I can't grieve for the souls that are so lost
I can't leave because my fucking self is holding me down
Imagine cold hands up to your throat
The thought alone makes you swallow your hope
And now it's harder to cope, and I don't know where I'll go
These fallacies, I don't believe in fear that nobody knows

It's a red night, and I don't see any light
And then a fatline, I'm fucking ready to die

As I look up from the ground
I see darkness all around
And I'm lost but can't be found inside my mind
Goodbye...
As I look up from the ground
I see darkness all around
And I'm lost but can't be found up in the sky
Goodbye...

Watch as we all fall apart
We all fall apart?
We all fall apart

Would you forgive me if I told you that I lied like you?
So full of hate with no love to lose
Would you deny it if I asked you just to tell the truth?
'Cause in the end, you gotta decide what side to choose
Imagine cold hands holding your heart
The thought alone can only tear you apart
I know you wish it would end, it's sad it's only the start
These memories, they only mean my soul is empty and dark

It's a red night, and I don't see any light
And then a flatline, I'm fucking ready to die

As I look up from the ground
I see darkness all around
And I'm lost but can't be found inside my mind
Goodbye...
As I look up from the ground
I see darkness all around
And I'm lost but can't be found up in the sky
Goodbye...

It's a red night, and I don't see any light
And then a flatline, I'm fucking ready to die
It's a red night, if it's wrong or it's right
And if I don't fight, it's like being buried alive
It's a red night, and I don't see any light
And then a flatline, I'm fucking ready to die
It's a red night, if it's wrong or it's right
And if I don't fight, it's like being buried alive

'Cause I, I wanna feel anything
And I know that we all think
We can't be wrong, soon we'll all be gone
And I, I don't know what this means
But if I knew anything
I'd know for sure, we'll all be gone and on

As I look up from the ground
I see darkness all around
And I'm lost but can't be found inside my mind
Goodbye...
As I look up from the ground
I see darkness all around
And I'm lost but can't be found up in the sky
Goodbye...
