Hey, yeah
(Do your thing, honey!)
I could feel it from the start
Couldn't stand to be apart
Somethin' 'bout you caught my eye
Somethin' moved me deep inside
Don't know what you did boy, but you had it
And I've been hooked ever since
I told my mother, my brother
My sister and my friends
I told the others, my lovers
Both past and present tense
Everytime I see you, everything starts making sense
(Do your thing, honey!)
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do
You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're bad ass
Ain't no other man, its true
Ain't no other man but you
Never thought I'd be alright
(No, no, no)
Till you came and changed my life
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
What was cloudy now is clear
(Yeah, yeah)
You're the light that I needed
You got what I want boy and I want it
So keep on giving it up
Tell your mother, your brother
Your sister, and your friends
And the others, your lovers
Better not be present tense
Cause I want everyone to know
That you are mine and no one else's
Oh-woah, oh
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do
You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're bad ass
Ain't no other man, its true
Ain't no other man but you
(Break it down now!)
Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other, other
Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other lover
Ain't no other, I, I, I need no other
Ain't no other man but you, oh
You are there when I'm a mess
You talked me down from every ledge
Give me strength, boy, you're the best
You're the only one who's ever passed every test
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do
You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're bad ass
Ain't no other man, its true
Ain't no other man but you
And now I'm tellin' you, so, ain't no other man but you
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do
You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're bad ass
Ain't no other man, its true
Ain't no other man but you
