See me a big woman, big woman look how you dance
See me a big woman, big woman caught in a trance
In a trance
Dancing on the tabletop, covered up with the Easter feast
You're dancing for the fishermen, from the very large right
To the least
Dancing for the slow release, first the boy and then the beast
Then the beast

Burning, burning with the kiss of life
Burning, burning with the kiss of life

See me, a big woman, big woman so full of life
See me, a big woman, big woman going to be my wife
Be my wife
Watching for the different eyes
They change your face
They come inside
Watch the spirits laugh and cry, watch them find a place to hide
Watch the spirits talk in tongues, watch them take you for a ride
For a ride
Down at the ocean lies a body in the sand
Big woman sits beside, head in hand
With heat from her skin, and fire from her breath
She blows hard, she blows deep in the mouth of death

Burning, burning with the kiss of life
Burning, burning with the kiss of life
Burning, burning with the kiss of life
