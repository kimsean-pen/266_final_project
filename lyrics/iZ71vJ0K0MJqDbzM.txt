Ladies and Gentlemen
Introducing "The Chocolate Starfish
And the Hot Dog Flavored Water"
Bring it on
Get the fuck up
Yeah
Check
One, two

Listen up
Listen up
Here we go (here we go)
It's a fucked up world (world)
A fucked up place (place)
Everybody's judged by their fucked up face
Fucked up dreams (dreams)
Fucked up life (life)
A fucked up kid with a fucked up knife
Fucked up moms (moms)
And fucked up dads (dads)
A fucked up cop with a fucked up badge
Fucked up job (job) with fucked up pay
And a fucked up boss is a fucked up day
Fucked up press
And fucked up lies (lies)
While Lethal's in the back with the fucked up eyes

Hey (it's on)
Everybody knows it's on
Hey (it's on)
Everybody knows it's on

Ain't it a shame that you can't say fuck? (fuck!)
Fuck's just a word and it's all fucked up
Like a fucked up punk (punk)
With a fucked up mouth (mouth)
A nine-inch nail get knocked the fuck out
Fucked up AIDS (AIDS) from fucked up sex (sex)
Fake-assed titties on a fucked up chest
We're all fucked up
So what cha wanna do
With fucked up me
And fucked up you?

You wanna fuck me like an animal
You like to burn me on the inside
You like to think that I am a perfect drug
Just know that nothing you do
Will bring you closer to me

Ain't life a bitch? (bitch)
A fucked up ditch (ditch)
A fucked up sore with a fucked up stitch
A fucked up head (head) is a fucked up shame
Swingin' on my nuts it's a fucked up game
Jealousy fillin' up a fucked up mind
It's real fucked up like a fucked up crime
If I say fuck two more times
That's forty-six fucks in this fucked up rhyme

Hey (it's on)
Everybody knows it's on
Hey (it's on)
Everybody knows it's on

You wanna fuck me like an animal
You like to burn me on the inside
You like to think that I am a perfect drug
Just know that nothing you do
Will bring you closer to me

Listen up baby
You can't bring me down (bring me down)
I don't think so (I don't think so)
You better check yourself (check yourself)
Before you wreck yourself
Kiss my starfish, my chocolate starfish, punk
Kiss my starfish, my chocolate starfish

You wanna fuck me like an animal
You wanna burn me on the inside
You like to think that I am a perfect drug
Just know that nothing you do
Will bring you closer to me
