If it's really what you needed, love
Baby this right here's a world of fun
But you can get this hit whenever you want

So here you are now
And it's on now
And it's on right now
Here you are now
And it's on now
And it's on right now
Here we are now
And it's on now
And it's on

Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly
Off the ground
I'm lifting it up
Sending it, sending it, sending it
Off the ground
I'm lifting it up
Cooling it, cooling it, cooling it
Cool it down
I'm lifting you off the ground
I'm getting you off
It's on right now

Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly
Off the ground (off ground)
I'm lifting it up (up)
Sending it, sending it, sending it
Off the ground (off ground)
I'm lifting it up (up)
Cooling it, cooling it, cooling it
Cool it down (cool down)
I'm lifting you off the ground (off ground)
I'm getting you off (up down)
It's on right now

Send it off, send it off, in and out
Give it all, give it all, give it out
There we are, there we are, here and now
Let it all come out, let it all come out

I can move it to wherever you are
We can live this life forever more
Baby this right here is a one on one
But you can get this dick whenever you want

So here we are now
And it's on now
And it's on right now
Here we are now

Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly
Off the ground
I'm lifting it up
Sending it, sending it, sending it
Off the ground
I'm lifting it up
Cooling it, cooling it, cooling it
Cool it down
I'm lifting you off the ground
I'm getting you off
It's on right now

Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly
Off the ground (off ground)
I'm lifting it up (up)
Sending it, sending it, sending it
Off the ground (off ground)
I'm lifting it up (up)
Cooling it, cooling it, cooling it
Cool it down (cool down)
I'm lifting you off the ground (off ground)
I'm getting you off (up down)
It's on right now

Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly
