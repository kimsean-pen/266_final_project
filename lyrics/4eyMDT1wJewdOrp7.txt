the gloom of my tired soul
is reflecting in myself
between us
there lies a kind of sad seclusion

the shining of the moon
floods the streets
and endless lines of houses
I can hear the echo of my footsteps

when did I start to devote myself
entirely to the sleep?
and when I dream of a different world
there is no reason left for fear
there's nothing that depresses me
no grief no sentimentality
nothing but deep deep sleep

finally at home
I am wrapped up in a deeper darkness
and I'm unable
to think about solutions

the sleep comes over me
like the flood overflows the beach
the moment I wake up
let me feel forsaken

when did I start to devote myself
entirely to the sleep?
and when I dream of a different world
there is no reason left for fear
there's nothing that depresses me
no grief no sentimentality
nothing but deep deep sleep
