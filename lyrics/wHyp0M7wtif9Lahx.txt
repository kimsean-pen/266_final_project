Do you remember back in the day? The years of growing up
Having a laugh and having a say and not much to worry about
They were the times we truly believed the world belongs to us
We had our empty streets and blood on saturday night

Do you remember those crazy days and all the backstreet stories
We kept our dreams alive, guards up and heads held high
And only seem like yesterday you had your days of glory
But all your passion faded and died

Where are those that shout the loudest?
They had their time - They been and gone
Different reasons, different stories, different types
But look at me... I still carry on!

Today you think you got it sussed, you run your old man's firm
Few old records in the loft and a pair of old DM's
Enjoying 2tone cover bands while eating your sunday roast
You're a bootboy once a year at the weekend down the coast

Where are those that shout the loudest?
They had their time - They been and gone
Different reasons, different stories, different types
But look at me... I still carry on!

Look at me today I'm still going strong
I made mistakes along the way but I'm here where I belong
Can you tell me mate how long did you last?
Go away! And take your stories from the past

Where are those that shout the loudest?
They had their time - They been and gone
Different reasons, different stories, different types
But look at me...

Where are those that shout the loudest?
They had their time - They been and gone
Different reasons, different stories, different types
But look at me... I still carry on!

Where are those that shout the loudest?
Where are they now?
They had their time - They been and gone
Where are they now?
Different reasons,
Different stories, where are they now?
But I still carry on!
I still carry on!
I still carry on!
I still carry on!
I still carry on!
I still carry on!
I still carry on!
I still carry on!
I still carry on!
I still carry on!
I still carry on!
