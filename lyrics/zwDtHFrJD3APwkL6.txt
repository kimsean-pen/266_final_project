We're going faster like a bullet round
To save the future for the human kind

Faster!

Depleted every source
Endangered our own lives
A soil that is burned
Destruction unrepairable
War of the world's Orchestral demise
So what comes up always falls straight back down

Losing the hope to save what's left for you and me
Dancing on strings above the abyss I cry
Reach for the skies

We're going faster
Like a bullet round
To save the future
For the human kind
We set ourselves on fire
For our last goodbye

We're going faster
Like a bullet round
To save the future
For the human kind
We are giving our hearth away

We're going faster!

Defeated every threat
And made this habitat burn
This cynical form mankind
Made sure we never turn
Mission is set
We colonize afar
An epiphany for us all as there is no withdraw

Losing the hope to save what's left for you and me
Dancing on strings above the abyss I cry
Reach for the skies

We're going faster
Like a bullet round
To save the future
For the human kind
We set ourselves on fire
For our last goodbye

We're going faster
Like a bullet round
To save the future
For the human kind
We are giving our hearth away

We're going faster!

Losing the hope to save what's left for you and me
Dancing on strings above the abyss I cry
Reach for the skies
We're going faster
Like a bullet round
To save the future
For the human kind
We set ourselves on fire
For our last goodbye
We're going faster
Like a bullet round
To save the future
For the human kind
We are giving our hearth away
We're going faster!
