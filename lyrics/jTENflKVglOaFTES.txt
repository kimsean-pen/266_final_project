How did we get so low?
We started so high, now we can't let go
Pavements return to gold
Now I see ghosts everywhere I go

I built it up
Thought I was lost
I'm movin' on
You are the demon at my gate

Can't take the heat
Thought I was young
More of the common
All the things I used to hate

Rest in peace, the man I used to be

I feel the magic, it burns in the air
I see illusions are everywhere
I feel the magic, it's out of control
Smoke and mirrors everywhere I go

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I feel the magic everywhere I go

As we go down this road
For miles and miles, away from home
Colours are bright and bold
Not black and white, as they were before

I told you once
Won't tell you twice
I'm movin' on
You are the demon at my gate

Can't take the heat
Thought I was young
More of the common
All the things I used to hate

Rest in peace, the man I used to be

I feel the magic, it burns in the air
I see illusions are everywhere
I feel the magic, it's out of control
Smoke and mirrors everywhere I go

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I feel the magic everywhere I go

I spent my life just wasting time
Looking for a reason so I can say
Rest in peace, the man I used to be

I feel the magic, it burns in the air
I see illusions are everywhere
I feel the magic, it's out of control
Smoke and mirrors everywhere I go

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I feel the magic everywhere I go

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I feel the magic everywhere I go

How did we get so low?
We started so high, now we can't let go
