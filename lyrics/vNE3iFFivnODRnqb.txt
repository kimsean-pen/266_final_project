Your needs need attention
I'm blinded by the truth
Let me release the tension
It's taken hold of you

It's only natural
To free the animal
Locked up inside

The nature of the beast is
You want it
Nature of the beast is
I do too
Let's unleash and cut the creature loose
It's the nature of the beast in you

You wrap yourself around me
You're tightening the noose
Trapped in the cage surrounding
The sinful side of you

It's only natural
To free the animal
Locked up inside

The nature of the beast is
You want it
Nature of the beast is
I do too
Let's unleash and cut the creature loose
It's the nature of the beast in you

It's only natural
To free the animal
Locked inside you...

The nature of the beast is
You want it
Nature of the beast is
I do too
Let's unleash and cut the creature loose
It's the nature of the beast in you

The nature of the beast is
You want it
Nature of the beast is
I do too
Let's unleash and cut the creature loose
It's the nature of the beast in you
