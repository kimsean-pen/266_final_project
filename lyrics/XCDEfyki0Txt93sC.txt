Everything you think
You know baby, is wrong
And everything you think
You had baby, is gone

Certain things turn ugly
When you think too hard
And nagging little thoughts
Change into things you can't turn off

Everything you think
You know baby, is wrong

It's all over but the crying
Fade to black, I'm sick of trying
Took too much and now I'm done
It's all over but the crying

Do you really think I'm made of stone, baby?
C'mon
That we only love the things we own?
Baby, you're wrong

Certain things just happen
When you make no plans
And love can really tear you up
And it can break you down

Everything you think
You know baby, is wrong

It's all over but the crying
Fade to black, I'm sick of trying
Took too much and now I'm done
It's all over but the crying

Baby, we're done

If I could I would, I'd change everything
'Cause I can't forget you though you don't believe me
Now I can't walk back, I can't leave behind
Where does it go all the light that we had?

Everything you think
You know baby, is wrong
And everything you think
You had baby, is gone

Baby, we're done
