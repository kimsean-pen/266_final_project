He loves your sexy body
He loves your dirty mind
He loves when you hold him
Grab him from behind
Oh baby
You're such a pretty thing
I can't wait to introduce you to the other members of my gang
You don't need no wax job
You're smooth enough for me

If you need your oil change
I'll do it for you free
Oh baby
The pleasur'd be all mine
If you let me drive your pickup truck
And park it where the sun don't shine

Every time he touches you
His hair stands up on end
His legs begin to quiver
And his mind begins to bend
Oh baby
You're such a tasty treat
But I'm under doctor's orders I'm afraid to overeat
He love your sense of humor
Disposition too
There's absolutely nothing
That he don't love about you
Oh baby
I'm on my hands and knees
Life would be so simple
If I only had you to please
Oh baby
Turn around and say goodbye
You go to the airport now and I'm goin' home and cry

(He loves your) electric dumplings
(He loves your) red bell peppers
(He loves your) fuel injection
(He loves your) service charge
(He loves your) five-speed gearbox
(He loves your) long endurance
(He loves your) quest for junk food
(He loves your) big refrigerator
(He loves your) trembling wilbury
(He loves your) marble earrings
(He loves your) porky curtains
(He loves your) power steering
(He loves your) bottled water
(He loves your) parts and service
Dirty world
A dirty world
it's a fucking dirty world
