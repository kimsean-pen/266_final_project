lie in bed at night
and I'm afraid to sleep
God if I close my eyes,
I pray my soul to keep
I tell them from this monster,
but they don't understand
they can't feel the slash,
of Freddy's hand

Nightmare on Elm Street
where I'm trapped inside a dream
nightmare on Elm Street
where no one can hear me scream

A bastard son of 1000 maniacs
locks us inside his hell
we must send him back
killed him once
burning him alive
kill him twice
drag him to the other side

Nightmare on Elm Street
where I'm trapped inside a dream
nightmare on Elm Street
where no one can hear me scream

Nightmare on Elm Street (oh oh oh)
where I'm trapped inside a dream
nightmare on Elm Street (oh oh oh)
where no one can hear me scream

Wohh wohh oh whooum

I lie in bed at night
and I'm afraid to sleep
God if I close my eyes,
I pray my soul to keep
I tell them from this monster,
but they don't understand
they can't feel the slash,
of Freddy's hand

Nightmare on Elm Street (oh oh oh)
where I'm trapped inside a dream
nightmare on Elm Street (oh oh oh)
where no one can hear me scream

Nightmare on Elm Street (oh oh oh)
where I'm trapped inside a dream
nightmare on Elm Street (oh oh oh)
where no one can hear me scream

Hear me scream!
