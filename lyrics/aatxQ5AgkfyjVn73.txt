Something's coming up
When the sun goes down
Try to find my luck

Doing the best I can
Write a simple plan
Doing the best I can

'Cause I know you believe me, baby
If I make it sure you do
When I say I'm a dreamer, baby
Dreaming about you, ooh

I forgot your name but I like you, I like you
I forgot your name but I like you, I like you

You don't know how you feel
If this is for real
You don't know how to feel

Know it's up to you
Say what you wanna do
And I'll be your fool

'Cause I know you believe me, baby
If I make it sure you do
When I say I'm a dreamer, baby
Dreaming about you, ooh

I forgot your name but I like you, I like you
I forgot your name but I like you, I like you

I wanna know 'bout your wildest fantasy
Is it involving me?
Let's go to space and forget everyone else
Let's take a chance, oh-oh
I am trying the best I can to understand, oh-oh
Can you give us a second chance?

Something's coming up
When the sun goes down
Try to find my luck

I know I have to show
Before I have to go
Gotta let you know

I forgot your name but I like you, I like you
I forgot your name but I like you, I like you

I wanna know 'bout your wildest fantasy
Is it involving me?
Can you give us a second chance?
Let's dance

I forgot your name but I like you, I like you
I forgot your name but I like you, I like you
I forgot your name but I like you, I like you
I forgot your name but I like you, I like you
