Dark smiles saying nothing
The warpath, straight and lonely
Both sides feel the cold front closing in

Reveal the frozen pieces of earth

Can't hear the hidden sounds from its closed mouth
No more secret truths said into the soundproof walls

They sing we're restored to life

From the dust of this planet you sing
Stand up and sing
Ashes in ears
There's no way home
Just sing this song

They sing we're restored to life
Pull the rusting nails from these walls
Peel off your broken nails

Wake wake up the sun
Just take it all back
