The pledge
I've forgotten this time
I am so uncertain
That my heart will go on
My beloved one
If you were here you'd find
That I'm not feeling well
But that I will have to go on

And though summer unwinds now
I have no reason to follow
I have only you
My sun is pale
My heart's old

Why
So quiet this new night
There's a white cloud
Under my eyelid
My beloved one
There is swirling dark
Shrouding my freedom

Cold is the undertone
Hold my hand
I'm in the waiting line
Mute I stand
Barren ground
