Me and you can't seem to keep our hands off each other
Black and blue
We always seem to hurt one another
You kiss like a cut
Your love leaves a bruise
It's breaking my heart
The things that we do
Keep fighting a war we're both gonna lose
The good turned bad and so did you

Even when you knock me out
I never get enough of you
Hit me with another round
I'm never giving up on you
If we're playing rough give me your tough love
Take off the gloves
Give me your tough love

Tied in knots so tight that we can never unravel
We're on the rocks
Dancing on the edge of disaster
You kiss like a cut
Your love leaves a bruise
It's breaking me down depending on you
Keep fighting a war we're both gonna lose
The good turned bad and I did too

Even when you knock me out
I never get enough of you
Hit me with another round
I'm never giving up on you
If we're playing rough give me your tough love
Take off the gloves
Give me your tough love

When it aches I want to feel it
Cuz you make it hurt to be alone
When it breaks down and I'm all out of reasons
It's obvious but I'm the last to know

Even when you knock me out
I never get enough of you
Hit me with another round
I'm never giving up on you

Even when you knock me out
I never get enough of you
Hit me with another round
I'm never giving up on you
If we're playing rough give me your tough love
Take off the gloves
Give me your tough love

Take off the gloves
Give me your tough love
