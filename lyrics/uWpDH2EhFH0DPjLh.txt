I see it in your eyes
Your feeling paranoid
You know just what I've done
You know what I've become
I feel it deep inside
With all the pain and lies
I know just what I want
I am an animal

I think it's time I let you go,
Why did you send me off

You can't cage the beast,
There's no break in me
You can't cage the beast inside of me
I feel the rage,
And all the the pain
You can't cage the beast inside of me
Inside of me

I feel it in your bite
You are a parasite
Who knows just what I've done
I think your time has come

You tried to turn the tide
I think you've lost your mind
Afraid of what I want
This sick animal I've become

I think it's time I let you go,
Why did you send me off

You can't cage the beast,
There's no break in me
You can't cage the beast inside of me
I feel the rage, and all the pain
You can't cage the beast inside of me
Inside of me

You can't cage the beast,
There's no break in me
You can't cage the beast inside of me
I feel the rage, and all the pain
You can't cage the beast inside of me
Inside of me
