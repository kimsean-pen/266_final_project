Today is the day that I chuck
Everything I thought out the door
Today is the day I ask myself
What the hell was I living for, that's right

Today is the day it starts right here
Don't gotta thing to worry about now
Today is the day it starts right here

I thought about it, and it's kinda strange
Everything that I tried so hard
Thought about it and I gotta say
I had it wrong right from the start, that's right

Today is the day it starts right here
Don't gotta thing to worry about now
Today is the day it starts right here
Come on man, and don't you worry now

Everything that I thought that I believed
Oh baby, was all so clear to me
But now I know that I was wrong
It's gone, it's gone, gone, gone
It's alright now

Today is the day that you see me
As a man who will always change
Who knows the only things to count on
Are life is quick, and life is strange, that's right

Today is the day it starts right here
Don't gotta thing to worry about now
Today is the day it starts right here
Come on man, and don't you worry now

Today is the day it starts right here
Don't gotta thing to worry about now
Today is the day it starts right here
Come on man, and don't you worry now

I don't know if you'll come along
I just wanted to sing my song about change
Today is the day
