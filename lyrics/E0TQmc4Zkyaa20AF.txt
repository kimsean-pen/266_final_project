In the womb
Was the fate decided?
I'm going to be sick
The feelings that I hid
4... 3...2... 1
That can't be counted
Overpowering grief

In a maze

Raw scar
Can't get back
Lie, Coward, Bullshit

My heart is disturbed by you

In the womb
Was the fate decided?
I'm going to be sick

裂けだした未来 飾る言葉が無い
その愛から今 飛び立つ

In a maze

Raw scar
Can't get back
Lie, Coward, Bullshit

Go away
I say good-bye to hateful you once
Again
Go away
I say good-bye to hateful you
Forget up to now with me

In the womb
Was the fate decided?
I'm going to be sick

I know your ugliness

I My feelings for you never change

My life is dirty now

Such a life is sad
