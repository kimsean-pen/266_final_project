I'm the water, consuming all my kind, destined for alteration
And Momma ain't lying for her daughter
I know on mother earth I see the weather

So I'm not gonna cover up the freckles on my faces
I covered all the bases

Follow me to my bed
'Cause every time you fall, I'll be holdin' your head up
And when will you get tired of feeling bad?
And every time you fall, fall on me
Follow me to my bed
'Cause every time you fall, I'll be holdin' your head up
And when will you get tired of feeling bad?
And every time you fall, fall on me

He's so hollow
My baby, made him blind until he wasted fate
So I'm left behind until he curse my sorrow
But I know on mother earth I see the weather

So I won't let you burden in all my safest places
I, I covered all the bases

Follow me to my bed
'Cause every time you fall, I'll be holdin' your head up
And when will you get tired of feeling bad?
And every time you fall, fall on me
Follow me to my bed
'Cause every time you fall, I'll be holdin' your head up
And when will you get tired of feeling bad?
And every time you fall, fall on me
