Whenever I fall asleep I keep on waking up to the same goddamn dreams
It's just me drowning with my arm,
from the elbow up, reaching out for anything
Like in Ninja Turtles Two: The Secret of the Ooze
Is it my friends with their t-break
moves, or just a little bit less fast food?
When you decide to leave this bullshit for bullshit and nothing
If you forget about me, it's alright, I understand I guess
I'd leave and forget if I had the chance

I still never got to the bottom of why you gave up
Ain't it kind of funny how the only thing that's never quite so
mutual is me preaching perpetual while you're fulfilling ritual
I'm sorry to get technical but I find it acceptable

I'm moving on
There's something about my new stitched up thumb
that makes it feel kind of funny calling it "moving on"

Now that you're gone
We need something to mask the weed smell here
Like a candle or fumes from the old space heater

Whenever I'm freaking out I keep the thought
of the cast of Friends real close to my head
It's not absurd to say that ten goddamn
seasons would be the longest friendship I'd ever have
And if Ross and Rachel last, maybe this feeling too shall pass
But now you fuckers know I'm sad from
all of these twenty minute intervaled claps

So when I decide to go illegally download my movies
I shouldn't have to take a breather
I really shouldn't get so mad if the video and audio don't quite match
