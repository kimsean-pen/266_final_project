I'll come down to get you high
And maybe sing you a lullaby
Sing you to sleep, a sleep you'll never wake from
Sing you to coma so to speak

When I fall down I'll fall apart
Trade in my bike for a shopping cart
And beg change from a world that needs some
Like I need someone

So where are you, my little needle?
The stack's been burned away
But I'm so inebriated that I
Cannot see three feet in front of me
Between the moon and you, lunacy is setting in

Lately I've been feeling dead inside
Like my guts have dried up and died
But every night I water them back to life
Yeah, every night I water them back to life

When I fall down I'll fall apart
Trade in my bike for a shopping cart
And beg change from a world that needs some
I'm tired of sleeping alone

So where are you, my little needle?
The stack's been burned away
But I'm so inebriated that I
Cannot see three feet in front of me
Between the moon and you, lunacy is setting in
