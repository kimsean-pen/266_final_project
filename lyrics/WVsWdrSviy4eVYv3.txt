Get them a message, a message from me
I'm caught up in love and I'm in ecstassy
What can I do now when nothing's the same?
And I don't know I wanna do it again
Well tell me now

Life is so simple when you are with me
Cos when we're together I'm in ecstasy
I'm in ecstasy, I'm in ecstasy, I'm in ecstasy

Everybody go

All you pretty things get on board this mothership
All you've gotta be is ready for action baby

Don't think I'm twisted, as a matter of fact
Welcome you now to the second act
I fought off robots and the men in the suits
Where at the soles of your monkey boots

I can't get enough by the sunshine
I can't get enough by the moonlight
And all the colours that are coming on strong
Trying to hold on trying to hold
I can't get enough by the oceans
I can't get enough by the mantra
All we will ever feel is ecstassy
We're in ecstasy, We're in ecstasy, We're in ecstasy

Everybody go

All you pretty things get on board this mothership
All you've gotta be is ready for action baby

I can't get enough by the sunshine
I can't get enough by the moonlight
And all the colours that are coming on strong
Trying to hold on trying to hold
I can't get enough by the oceans
I can't get enough by the mantra
All we will ever feel is ecstassy
We're in ecstasy, We're in ecstasy, We're in ecstasy, we're in ecstasy

Everybody go
All you pretty things get on board this mothership
All you've gotta be is ready for action baby
ready for action baby ready for action baby
