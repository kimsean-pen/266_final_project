In the eyes of the reefers and islands
In the skies and the clouds in the clear
All it takes another day for survival
Reaching out from the silence to feel
Forgiven, forgiven

When we came to the fire at the fuss baby
Think we worry about what could be
Open??? wide as the first taste
Follow tea to the tree to the dream
Forgiven, forgiven

Wanted to make it rain at the right time
For the hours it rained down inside of me
For the fakes and delays of a lifetime
Feel the cracks in repeat in history
Forgiven, forgiven
