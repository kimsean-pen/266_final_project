I was raised by this town
To believe the words they put inside me
They made me hide
Inside their loving arms around me

I turned away
I choose the path that I believe in
I stand today
Above the shady nights behind me
I fear nothing
But the fact that I'm afraid of everything
I knew my name
Would only be for lonely riding

Choose to be me, to be free, to be my way
I saw the light shining right in my eyes
Choose to be me, to be free, to be my way

Inside the night
I write the lonely story of my life
It makes me cry
But I want to know it 'til the last line
I fear nothing
But the fact that I'm afraid of everything
Destiny â€“ blow it away
I am made for lonely riding

Choose to be me, to be free, to be my way
I saw the light shining right in my eyes
Choose to be me, to be free, to be my way
With a smile on
With a smile, hey!

Every day my sun keeps rising
Giving me the strength that I need
All the faith I need for only you and I

Happiness is here with me
It's made for all the days I see
And happiness is holding me around
And round and round and round and round

I choose to be me, to be free, to be my way
I saw the light shining right in my eyes
Choose to be me, to be free, to be my way
With a smile on
With a smile

I choose to be me, to be free, to be my way
I saw the light shining right in my eyes
Choose to be me, to be free, to be my way
