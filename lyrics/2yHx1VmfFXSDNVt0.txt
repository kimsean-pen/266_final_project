I know a man who fills his emptiness
with strangers
I know a girl who drinks herself to
sleep at night
You can't change her
I know people who use chat rooms as
confessionals
I know down and outs who once were,
once they were professionals
Wipe it off your sleeve
Your superiority
Don't roll your eyes my sweet

I know a single mother who loses
her mind
On weekends
She pleads with lady luck on scratch
cards with money lent to her
By old friends
I know people who take midnight
drives for head space
I know they'd give for just one
loving embraces
Wipe it off your sleeve
Your superiority
Don't roll your eyes my sweet

We're just the same
We all get desperate sometimes
Feeling black and blue
I know you'll find it hard
to accept it sometimes
We all feel black and we feel blue
Wipe it off your sleeve
Your superiority
Don't roll your eyes my sweet

I know a rich man who has everything
you could wish for
But children
I know an old lady who talks a lot but
could teach you
If you listen
I know people who believe in gods and demons
I know ones who think there's nothing
there at all
Wipe it off your sleeve
Your superiority
Don't roll your eyes my sweet

We're just the same
We all get desperate sometimes
Feeling black and blue
I know you'll find it hard
to accept it sometimes
We all feel black and we feel blue
Wipe it off your sleeve
Your superiority
Don't roll your eyes my sweet

Wipe it off your sleeve
Your superiority
Don't roll your eyes my sweet.
