I can see why you think you belong to me
I never tried to make you think or let you see
One thing for yourself
But now you're off with someone else and I'm alone
You see, I thought that I might keep you for my own

Amie, what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer if I do

Don't you think the time is right for us to find
All the things we thought weren't proper could be right in time?
And can you see which way we should turn, together or alone?
I can never see what's right or what is wrong
Oh, you take too long

Amie, what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer if I do

Well, Amie, what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer if I do

Now it's come to what you want, you've had your way
And all the things you thought before just faded into gray
And can you see that I don't know if it's you or if it's me?
If it's one of us, I'm sure we both will see
Won't you look at me and tell me

Amie, what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer if I, longer if I do, yeah, now

Amie, what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you
For a while, maybe longer if I do

I keep falling in and out of love with you
Falling in and out of love with you
Don't know what I'm gonna do
I keep falling in and out of love with you
