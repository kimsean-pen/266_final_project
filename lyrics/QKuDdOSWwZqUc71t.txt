On a cold dark winter night
Hidden by the stormy light
A battle rages for the right
For what will become

In the valley of the damned
A warrior with sword in hand
Travels fast across the land
For freedom he rides

And the sign from the master on high
He screams aloud and across hear the cry

For the kingdom of fire and ice
And the power to be alive

Be strong, ride on
Carry on through the war
Come along carry on
Living for ever more

On the wings of death
By the hands of doom
By the darkest light
From the darkest moon

Crossing silent seas
Over mountains high
For we stand as one tonight

On the black wind forever
We ride on together
Destroying your evil
With freedom our guide

When the master will call us
He'll stand high before us
Our hearts filled with splendor
Our swords will shine over the light

In the valley of the damned
Days breaks with golden strand
Over pastures green it glows
To where night returns
In the shadows faces appear
Warriors wearing full metal gear
Join together one and all before the glorious light
Rise up, gather around
Come and hear what is said
Use your senses open your mind
Don't you ever forget
On the wings of life
By the hands of hope
By the brightest light
From the brightest sun
Crossing silent seas
Over mountains high
To the valley of the damned
