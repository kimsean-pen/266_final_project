Galaxy flicker???
its crimes all over video screens
and the nightmare doesn't hold the future teens
here comes that rain
that rain of ruin
yeah it's the keeper-keeper of the flame???
it's running and hiding the freezing rage
the more i'm turning into suffering???
here comes that rain
that rain of ruin
yeah it's the keeper-keeper of the flame

hold my cheap love
as sufferin' lies with the sunrise
sunrise

holding terror interest, they're killing time
prophets of speed giving us signs
the fake and the???
here comes the snipes
here comes that rain
that rain of ruin
yeah it's the keeper-keeper of the flame

galaxy flicker???
