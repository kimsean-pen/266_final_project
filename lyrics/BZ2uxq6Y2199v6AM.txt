(Ooohooo) Yeah, can you feel it, baby
(Ooohooo) I can too
(Ooohooo)
(Ooohooo)
(Ooohooo) Come on, swing it, c-come on, swing it
(Ooohooo) Come on, swing it, c-come on, swing it
(Ooohooo) One, two
(Ooohooo) Three, now we come to the pay off

It's such a good vibration!
It's such a sweet sensation!
It's such a good vibration!
It's such a sweet sensation!

(Ooohooo) Yo, it's about that time
To bring forth the rhythm and the rhyme
(Ooohooo) I'm a-gettin' mine so get yours
I wanna see sweat coming out your pores
(Ooohooo) On the house tip is how I'm swingin' this
Strictly hip hop, boy, I ain't singin' this
(Ooohooo) Bringin' this to the entire nation
Black, white, red, brown, feel the vibration
Come on, come on
Feel it, feel it
Feel the vibration

It's such a good vibration!
It's such a sweet sensation!
It's such a good vibration!
It's such a sweet sensation!

(Ooohooo) The vibrations, good like Sunkist
Many wanna know who done this
(Ooohooo) Marky Mark and I'm here to move you
Rhymes will groove you and I'm here to prove to you
(Ooohooo) That we can party on the positive side
And pump positive vibes so come along for the ride
(Ooohooo) Making you feel the rhythm is my occupation
So feel the vibration
Come on, come on
Feel it, feel it
Feel the vibration

It's such a good vibration!
It's such a sweet sensation!
It's such a good vibration!
It's such a sweet sensation!

Donnie D, break it down
(Ooohooo) Donnie D's on the back up
Drug free, so put the crack up
(Ooohooo) No need for speed, I'm anti D-R-U-G-G-I-E
My (Ooohooo) body is healthy, my rhymes makes me wealthy
And the Funky Bunch helps me
(Ooohooo) To bring you a show with no intoxication
So come on, feel the vibration
Yeah, can you feel it, baby
I can too

It's such a good vibration!
It's such a sweet sensation!
It's such a good vibration!
It's such a sweet sensation!

Now the time has come for you to get up
The rest had you fed up but yo, I won't let up
On the rhythm and rhyme that's designed to
Make your behind move to what I'm inclined to
Pure hip hop, no sell out
If you ain't in it to win it then get the hell out
I command you to dance, I wanna see motivation
So come on now, feel the vibration

It's such a good vibration! (Come on, come on, come on)
It's such a sweet sensation! (Feel it, feel it)
It's such a good vibration!
It's such a sweet sensation! (Feel the vibration)
It's such a good vibration!
It's such a sweet sensation!
It's such a good vibration!
It's such a sweet sensation!
