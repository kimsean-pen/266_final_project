To the morgue... Take him to the morgue
To the morgue... Take him to the morgue
At... Devil Lake... Sanitarium, many a patient had died in vain
Never a question to be asked, no no, never a thing to explain
So they took his bones and skin to the morgue in the West Wing
It was clear... to Doctor Eastmann
Harry had died of fright in the night
If he had cared he could have found the spider
Laying eggs in Harry¹s neck
The smoldering eyes... in Harry¹s head
Had become the home... of spiders instead
Solos: Simonsen - La Rocque
To the morgue ... Take him to the morgue
To the morgue ... Take him to the morgue
To the morgue... We must all go to the morgue
To the morgue ... We must all go to the morgue
Deep down ... below the ground
Where it was king of cold and damp
Too many stiffs to be fit in the cooler
Gathering dust in the Hallways of Death
The smoldering eyes... in Harry¹s head
Had become the home... of spiders instead
Spiders here ... Spiders everywhere
Spiders feeding the dead to their young
Spiders here... Spiders everywhere
Spiders using the dead for their name
Spiders ... They¹re growing like rats from the plague
Spiders ... There¹s so many more everyday
Solos: Simonsen - La Rocque
Summer is coming to an end
And the cellar in the morgue is a nest now
One thousand poisonous creatures
Eight thousand poisonous legs
The smoldering eyes... in Harry¹s head
Had become the home... of spiders instead
To the morgue. We must all go to the morgue...
