Lie beneath
Faded and selfish I fall between
Jaded and helpless, I long to breathe
Wasted and empty inside
To feel faceless and buried alone
Into your eyes I live, beautifully broken
Fight! We'll fight!
And bury our lies
We'll break these chains
And wash it away
Oh light, carry me over the ground
Heavy won't hold me down
Blind belief wasted in envy
I long to bleed, nameless and hated
I fall relieved, violent and empty
Alive to see, suffer in silence alone
Into your eyes I live
Beautifully broken
Fight! We'll fight!
And bury our lies
We'll break these chains
And wash it away
Oh light, carry me over the ground
Heavy won't hold me down
Love won't lie
Tell me it's over, so long
I've done wrong
Under the shadow of dawn
Fight! We'll fight!
And bury our lies
We'll break these chains
And wash it away
Carry me over the ground
Heavy won't hold me down
Into the sun we burn
Heavy won't hold me down!
Down!
Down!
Down!
