Allez, allez recommencez
C'est parti
Il faut avoir quelque chose pour cette barbe
We have to do something with that beard

Push, do you wanna have fun like that?
Push, then let's stack up the cash
Push, sipping on the good life
Push, push

Aiming for the big win
You want the world to know
Magazine star
Your name made-up in gold
All eyes on you
Better show them right now
Show what you do
Better work it right now

Push, make love to the camera
Push, do you want them to remember you?
Push, ping for the good life
Push, push

We want your swag
Than lick, your lips
We'll try, yes try, again, again
You got the facts, the looks
Stop so soon, you'll win

Push, do you wanna have fun like that?
Push, then let's stack up the cash
Push, sipping on the good life
Push, push

Aiming for the big dollars
You want the world to know
Magazine star
Your body brushed in gold

Push (make the extra machine ready)
Push (it's okay, roll over, pull over, yeah, come, come with me, now, come with me, now)
Push (it's okay, it's okay, yeah, relax, relax)

All eyes on you
Better show them right now
Show what you do
Better work it right now
Push

(To good look in my, in my undress, ah, for fuck sake)
