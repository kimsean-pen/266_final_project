I took a course in Hallelujah
I went to night school for the blues
I took some stuff they said would cool ya
But nothing seemed to light my fuse
But that's all in the past
Like a check that's in the mail
She was a tall whiskey glass
I was an old hound dog
That just loved to chase his tail
Until I met a Blind Man
Who thought me how to see
A Blind Man
Who could change night into day
And if-a I can
I'm gonna make you come with me
Because a-here comes the sun
And we'll be chasing all the clouds away
I've had some lovers like a joyride
Some things are never what they seem
My heaven's turned into a landslide
Thank God I woke up from that dream
I met a Blind Man
Who taught me how to see
A Blind Man
Who could change night into day
And if-a I can
I'm gonna make you come with me
BECAUSE-a here comes the sun
And we'll be chasing all the clouds the way
The way that some bees chase honey
And drink all the flowers dry
We'll be saving us a little money
And if that doesn't do it, yeah
I don't know the reason why
Don't make no sense in lightin' candles
There's too much moonlight in my eyes
I met a Blind Man
Who taught me how to see
Blind Man
Who could change night into day
And if-a I can
I'm gonna make you come with me
Because here comes the sun
Ain't no surprise
Ain't no doubt about it
Gonna open up our eyes
