Going to see end of days
I've been hanging on my phone all day
And the fear goes away
I might not need to stay
On this sinking ship for long

I can give it away everyday
I can fly and spend all my seconds
Like they're my last
It's not the past that scares me
Now what a great future this is gonna be

Y-o-l-o, why?
Y-o-l-o, why?

Used to think it was bad
That we were all going mad
But now it's fine to leave
Goodbye those old things
Carry me through the waves of change

Carry me through the waves of change
I know my place
It's a beautiful thing

Y-o-l-o, why?
Y-o-l-o, why?
Y-o-l-o, why?
