Something's going on, a change is taking place
Children smiling in the street have gone without a trace
This street used to be full, it used to make me smile
And now it seems that everyone is walking single file

And many bow their heads in shame
That used to hold them high
And those that used to say hello
Simply pass you by

Think for a minute, Stop for a minute
Think for a minute, Stop for a minute

I always said it could, they never though it would
The people look so pitiful, I'm thinking that it should
And now it's almost here, now its on its way
I can't help saying told you so and have a nice final day

And nothing I could say
Could ever make them see the light
Now apathy is happy that
It won without a fight

Think for a minute, Stop for a minute
Think for a minute, Stop for a minute

And many hang their heads in shame that used to hold them high
{Think for a minute}
And those that used to say hello simply pass you by
{Stop for a minute}

Think for a minute, Stop for a minute
Think for a minute, Stop for a minute
