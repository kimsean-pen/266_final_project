Crashing into walls
Banging on your door
So why'd you let me in?

Falling through the floor
Diving in too deep
Underneath your skin

So good, you got to abuse it
Too fast that sometimes you lose it
It chews you up when you feed it
But everyone needs to eat

Am I too much for you?
'Cause you're too much for me
Still wanna be
Corrupted

Let's convince ourselves
It's all under control
A storm that we can break
But is this what we want?

'Cause we might miss the hate
You know it feels so good
To make the same mistake
Mistake, mistake, mistake, mistake, mistake

So good, you got to abuse it
So fast that sometimes you lose it
It chews you up when you feed it
But everyone needs to eat

Am I too much for you?
'Cause you're too much for me
Still wanna be
Corrupted

Do you remember how it started?
Fairytale got twisted and decayed
The innocence has all been broken
How did we get this way?

So good, you got to abuse it
So fast that sometimes you lose it
It chews you up when you feed it
But everyone needs to eat

So good, you got to abuse it
So fast that sometimes you lose it
It chews you up when you feed it
But everyone needs to eat

Am I too much for you?
'Cause you're too much for me
Still wanna be
Still wanna be
Corrupted!
