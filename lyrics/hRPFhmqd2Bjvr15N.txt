-Why won't you look at me?-
-Fuck you, I look at you all the time. There is just nothing to look at.-
-Female, I am so furious in this moment.-
-I am also furious. Listen to my vocal inflection.-
-Now I am sad. I am sad because you are cruel. I am bored with you.-
-You are the worst. The worst.-
-I know you are, but what am I?-

It's strange, but I guess it makes sense, oh
That with age, we'd lose a lick of innocence
I give you words I stole right out of storybooks
And you give me those halfway smiles and dirty looks

If it isn't enough,
What can I possibly say to make it up?
If we run out of lust and trust we're truly fucked
And as we start to rust, our hearts combust
And just like us our love will bite the dust

My heart is truly open
And on my sleeve
But we're going through the motions
Stuck on repeat

And we're broken, broken
And it seems that we're going through the motions
Going through the motions.

-I am furious and sad and other feelings.-
-You do not know how to feel. You are a monster. I hate you.-

I depend on passion
Dispensed in an angry fashion
I need lashing out on brash decisions
We can't rap in the lies

These things that I know you hide that I'm not having
Blind eyes, content 365 when things go staggering

We're trying, it's just not there
Oh, we're dying
We just don't care
-Fuck you-
No, I'm no guts, no glory
No violence, no love story

If it isn't enough,
What can I possibly say to make it up?
If we run out of lust and trust we're truly fucked
And as we start to rust, our hearts combust
And just like us our love will bite the dust

My heart is truly open
And on my sleeve
But we're going through the motions
Stuck on repeat

And we're broken, broken
And it seems that we're going through the motions
Going through the motions.

-How did we get so lost?-

My heart is truly open
And on my sleeve
But we're going through the motions
Stuck on repeat

And we're broken, broken
And it seems that we're going through the motions
Going through the motions.

-I love you-
-I know, but you are sick-
