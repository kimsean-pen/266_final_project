Run around
We need to use it
Let it drip
But don't abuse it
Ruff enough
To make it submit
Run around
You know we can't quit
Tear it up
It doesn't matter
When your mind
Is a disaster
Happiness
Can make you sadder
When you're stuck
Inside the pattern

Turn back to pieces when I saw you

Take your car
And drive it nowhere
Turn me off
You know I don't care
Met your friend
He's such a cancer
Touch me when
You know I'm not there
How do you...
know when you're finished?
Does it feel...
Good to diminish?
Blow it up
Just to replenish
Dreamers just
A stupid cynic

Turn back to pieces when I saw you
(Turn back to pieces when I saw you)
Your smile is a kind of torture (Your smile is a kind of torture)
If you want something nice to look at
(If you want something nice to look at)
Stare at the sun and never turn back
(Stare at the sun)

Turn back to pieces when I saw you
(Turn back to pieces when I saw you)
Your smile is a kind of torture (Your smile is a kind of torture)
If you want something nice to look at
(If you want something nice to look at)
Stare at the sun and never turn back
(Stare at the sun and never turn back)
