I wanna hold a seance
For every heart I've broken
Put them all in a room
And say "get over it"

I'm fine
You're alive
You'll be ok
In some time

Ooooh

And I am bigger than the outside shell of my body
And if you touch it without asking then you'll be sorry

I'm fine
You're alive
You'll be ok
In some time

Ooooh

And when I first met you
I wanted to kiss you
And I
I wanted to need you
And now I'm forgetting why
I tried

And you'll call me
The maid of the mist
I'll probably cry when we kiss
You'll ask me why do I
Have to be so serious
Have to be so serious
Have to be so serious
Have to be so serious
