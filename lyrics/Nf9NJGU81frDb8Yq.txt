Now you should smile
Though your heart is aching
Smile even though it's breaking
When there are clouds
Way up in the sky
You're gonna get by
If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile, it may be, maybe tomorrow
You'll see the sun come shining through
For you

Oh, light up your face with gladness
Come on, hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Oh, you gotta smile
What's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you'd just smile

Come on
Now show me a little smile
