Hah
Dream
Dream Doll
Ha, ha, ha, ha

Yeah bitch, my name Dream
New Benz stay clean
Bitches thought I'd be a one hit wonder
Man, what the fuck do they mean?
I been a dime man, check your intercom
Bitches know my name ring (brang!)
I'm taking over, yeah, this summer
And all summer eighteen (hah)
All I hear from you is commentary
Fuck sending niggas commissary
I work hard for these coins
I monster ball, no Halle Berry
A bunch of bitches in the private [?]
Fuck broke bitches trying to tell me
Diva bitch, no Mariah Carey
Keep a shooter up beside the deli
Fifteen for a shoe
Broke bitches stay on mute
Better talk to me nice
Better keep that shit cute (yup)
These niggas can't link me
Broke bitches can't beat me
That nigga just bought a Honda
I spent that on my pinky
Who you with? Who you with?
Dream Doll too legit
I just want the money calling
If it ain't the "who is this?"
Niggas show me groupie love
Never been a groupie bitch
Most hated bad girl
Had the crib super lit
Got your nigga on FaceTime
Compliments my waste line
He told you he don't eat pussy
He ain't eat yours but he ate mine
I only link with my baddies
It don't count if you have me
Pull up in them panty
Hundred ring come in handy
