Why don't you see it? Why don't you feel me?
I won't repeat it, [?] eats me
Stable, spatial
I thought you'd seek me, my company
I had to get through those eyes to see that world complete
That world comes to me

I can show you what is what
I can show you how it operates
Now that I know you, I can show you how it works

I saw you speak and I don't believe
The [?] I'm at the beach with Jane
Cause Jane, I can lean on
You've got your secrets, your sovereignty
I want the [?] your eyes to reflect on me
With no complications

I can show you what is what
I can show you how it operates
Now that I know you, I can show you how it [?]
I can show you what is what
I can show you how [?]

This little [?]
A ceasing in time and the smiling
But that's all behind
Cause my world is peaceful
It's very kind
Silence [?]

Now that I know you, I can show you what is what
Now that I know you, I can show you how it [?]
Now, letting go, I can show you how it [?]
