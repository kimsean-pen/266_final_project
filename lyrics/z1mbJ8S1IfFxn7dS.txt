Remember when we were still friends
We could sing our hearts out
Of all the things you have given
You just kept on drinking

You are the rain that falls at night Beneath the water colour skies
You are the rain that falls at night Beneath the water colour skies

I knew there was poison in your wine
But your glass is not mine
Of all the things you have given
You just kept on drinking

You are the rain that falls at night Beneath the water colour skies
You are the rain that falls at night Beneath the water colour skies

Remember when we were still friends
We could sing our hearts out
Of all the things you have given
You just kept on drinking
