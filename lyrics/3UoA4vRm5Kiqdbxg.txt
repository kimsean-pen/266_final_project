Empty robot I'll put on you all emotions and a soul
I'll teach you to be a human being
You will have no trouble if you stick to what I mean
I'll put you right in my place
Make you learn how my face reacts
To all the wicked words of people trying hard to bring me down

Metal heart, iron mind
I don't really care if you will mess this up I will quit this lie
Metal heart, iron mind
I don't really care if you will mess this up I'll quit this life
