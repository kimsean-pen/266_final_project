It's 16 miles to the promised land
And I promise you I'm doing the best I can
Now don't fool yourself
In thinking you're more than a man
Cause you'll probably end up dead

I visit these
Mountains with frequency
And I stand here with my arms out
Now some days they'll last longer than others
But this day by the lake went too fast

And if you want me
You better speak up, I won't wait
So you better move fast

Don't fool yourself
In thinking you're more than you are
With your arms outstretched to me

Now it's 16 miles to the promised land
And I promise you I'm doing the best I can
Now some days they last longer than others
But this day by the lake went too fast

And if you want me
You better speak up, I won't wait
So you better move fast

And some days they last longer than others
But this day by the lake went too fast
And if you want me
You better speak up, I won't wait
So you better move fast
