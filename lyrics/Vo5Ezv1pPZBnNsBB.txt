Let's make a mess
Steal a kiss in the moment
You and me
Everything that it could be
Touch don't go
Stay as long as you like

Let's get reckless
Dance with our hands to the beat
Don't let this
Slip through our fingers
It feels insane
Don't you put up a fight
Let's rough it up
'Til they shut it down

It's ah-ah- obvious
Right here's where the party starts with
You and me
All alone
No one has to know
It's ah-ah- obvious
To me
How it's gonna be
Ah-ah- obvious
When you come close to me

Let's make a scene
Like movies in our dreams
Make me scream
Take me down, no one's watching
Close your eyes
Play it back and rewind

So surreal
As the story unfolds on the screen
Stop stalling
The credits are rolling
Hold me now
Before we run out of time
Let's rough it up
'Til the end of the night

It's ah-ah- obvious
Right here's where the party starts with
You and me
All alone
No one has to know
It's ah-ah- obvious
To me
How it's gonna be
Ah-ah- obvious
When you come close to me

It's ah-ah- obvious
One kiss, it's easy to see
You and me

It's ah-ah- obvious
Right here's where the party starts with
You and me
All alone
No one has to know
It's ah-ah- obvious
To me
How it's gonna be
Ah-ah- obvious
When you come close to me

It's ah-ah- obvious
Right here's where the party starts with
You and me
All alone
No one has to know
It's ah-ah- obvious
To me
How it's gonna be
Ah-ah- obvious
When you come close to me
