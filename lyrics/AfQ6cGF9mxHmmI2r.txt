I wanna be famous on TV
so you'll hear me
want you to see me up on the big screen
oh i'll be so mean

All you'll hear is my song in your head
All you'll hear is my song in your head

I've got some more ideas
you'll be at home alone
i wanna make it big
that's something you'll never know

push me just to see me fall
you know I looked up to you
used to think you had it all
I was wrong about that too

Guess i learned from my mistakes
i'm just wasting my time
A girl like you stays the same
you got no one left on your side
one day you'll see, me on your tv
look at me look at me
one day you'll see, turn on your tv
one day you'll see, me on the big screen

I've got some more ideas
you'll be at home alone
I wanna make it big
that's something you'll never know
that's something you'll never know
