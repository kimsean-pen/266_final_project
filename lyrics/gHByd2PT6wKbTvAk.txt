Sad to see
I will stay awake
I'm leaving you
Just to be cruel

You don't haunt me anymore
You don't need me anymore

It's not the same
You're to blame
Tell me who ruined you
And we've been left behind
And fallen out of time

You're all that I have
Don't you know
You're all that I have
Don't you know

And we've been left behind
And you don't want me anymore
Throw me on the fire
You can throw me on the fire

You can throw me on the fire

Oh you call me when you lead
Run your fingers through your hair
Oh you call me when you lead
Run your fingers through your hair

And we've been left behind
And you don't want me anymore

Sad to see
I will stay awake
I'm leaving you
Just to be cruel

You don't haunt me anymore
You don't need me anymore

There's nothing left for us
Nothing left us
There's nothing left for us
There's nothing left for us

And we've been left behind
And you don't want me anymore

There's nothing left for us
Nothing left us
There's nothing left for us
There's nothing left for us

And we've been left behind
