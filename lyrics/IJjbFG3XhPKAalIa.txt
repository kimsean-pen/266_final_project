I can't fly
But I keep finding myself soaring high above this
I have nothing left
but I keep on pouring out like I am endless

Impossible
Impossible

I don't run too fast
but I'm looking back and miles and miles have passed
I can barely breathe
But I'm singing out like this is nothing to me

Impossible, woah, impossible

Every morning, I see another miracle
I can't believe, I'm living the impossible
We are the same and we are the wonder
Another day of living the impossible

Impossible
Impossible

I choose to be alive
Especially because the odds say I should die
I wrestle death again
I know more of his moves now and I won't give in

Impossible, woah, impossible

Every morning I see another miracle
I can't believe I'm living the impossible
We are the same and we are the wonder
Another day of living the impossible
Every morning I see another miracle
I can't believe I'm living the impossible
We are the same and we are the wonder
Another day of living the impossible
When I wake I wonder if I'm gonna be alright
But too many times I've seen this all come to life
If I make myself stop and remember

Every morning I see another miracle
I can't believe I'm living the impossible
We are the same and we are the wonder
Another day of living the impossible

Every morning I see another miracle
I can't believe I'm living the impossible
We are the same and we are the wonder
Another day of living the impossible
I'm living the impossible
We are the same and we are the wonder
I'm living the impossible

Impossible
