Do you remember when you woke up in that t-shirt you found
At the back of my bedroom underneath all your doubts
That you had in your head, ooooh they were there all along
But you just couldn't see my dark side with those rose lenses on

And I don't really know what I'm doing
And I'm sorry I put you through this
But I never said I'd treat you right

I told you I wish I could see you
I guess I was lonely
You chose to ignore what I said
Well I guess you just know me

And oh you feel low right now
3AM pouring out your soul right now
3AM wishing I could hold you now
Oh I should you tell you how

I just don't really know what I'm doing
And I'm sorry I put you through this
But I never said I'd treat you right
(Well I never said I'd treat you right)
But I never said I'd treat you right

But I never said I'd treat you right

Just as I woke up
Put your face to the back of my mind
Told myself I was feeling fine
But then you call me up
And said that we don't talk
But when we do I'm just crossing the line
But it felt good at the time
Oh oh, it should be me instead
But I guess it's just you who's the fool because I never said I'd...

But I never said I'd treat you right

But I never said I'd treat you right

I never said I'd treat you right

I still remember when you woke up in that t-shirt you found
At the back of my bedroom underneath all your doubts
That you had in your head, ooooh they were there all along
You said I didn't have a dark side, you were wrong

Oh I never said I'd treat you right
I never said I'd treat you right
'Cause I can never treat you right, no
