it's hard for me to see exactly where the hell I went wrong
I never thought I'd see the day we wouldn't get along
you think I smoke too much
I think your friends all suck
can't figure out the reason why our parents fight so much
and I've given up on luck

but I'm happy here
I'm happy here

so leave my sweater on the porch
I'll leave your bag under the stairs
don't go back to our old place
it's probably locked up anyway
I bet it still looks looks the same as when I ran away that day
it doesn't matter anyway

cause I'm happy here
cause I'm happy here
I'm happy here
I'm happy here

I sleep well alone now
I sleep well alone now
I sleep well alone now
I sleep well alone now
I sleep well alone now
I sleep well alone now
I sleep well alone now
I sleep well alone now
