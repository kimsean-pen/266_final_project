You're not coming back
You're not coming back from there
She's not coming back
She's not coming back from there

There's a girl in the corner
And she's crying for you
Gonna die for you
She's not coming back
She's not coming back from there
And you're not coming back
And you're not coming back again

You said you'd leave me and I will forget
I'm more than one and I see how it fights
You thought you love me but you just forget
You rolled in on but not too far
And you're not coming back
And you're not coming back from there

To all the boys you knew,
They don't belong outside, outside,
Outside, outside, outside

She's not coming back
And she's not coming back again
You say you feel it too much
You say you feel it too much
She's not coming back
She's not coming back
She's not coming back
And she's not coming back for me
