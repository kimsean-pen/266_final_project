Hired gun
Hired gun for sale
Hired gun, on the run
He won't fail

Requesting quick, they asked the people
Where's the hired gunman's trail?
He turned into a dark, cold corner
His is the face that is so pale

Hired gun
He's on the run
He has no fun, no

Please sit down, services rendered
Now we must decide the pay
Bargains to bribes, broken agreement
So much more had but to pray
Next a scam to execute, but a bit too cute
So if you're looking for adventure
Go check the hired gun for sale

Hired gun
He's on the run
Better watch out, boy
'Cause he don't know fun
