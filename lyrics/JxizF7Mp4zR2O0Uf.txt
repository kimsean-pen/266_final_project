Girl
Let's climb too high
Let's climb too high
For the stars
To reach us girl

Girl
I'm gonna take you hard
I'm gonna bring you higher
Than your mind
Can take you

Girl, let's climb too high
Let's climb too high
For the world to reach us girl
Girl, let's flee the light
Diaphanous
Let's slip into the night

Girl
I'm gonna slip inside
I'm gonna slip inside
Fly on fire to your mind

Girl
I'm gonna take you hard
Gonna take you harder
Than your body can take you

Girl, let's climb too high
Let's climb too high
For the stars to reach us girl
Yea

Girl, let's climb too high
Let's climb too high
For the world to reach us girl
Yea

Girl, let's climb too high
Let's climb too high
Yea, let's climb too high
Let's climb too high
