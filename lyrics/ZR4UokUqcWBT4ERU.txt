Usher (yeah, man)

So we back in the club
With our bodies rockin' from side to side
Si-side to side
Thank God the week is done
I feel like a zombie gone back to life
Back-back to life
Hands up, and suddenly we all got our hands up
No control of my body
Ain't I seen you before?
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes

'Cause baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
So dance, dance, like it's the last
Last night of your life, life
Gonna get you right
'Cause baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again

Keep downing drinks like this
Hope tomorrow that's just right now, now, now
Now, n-now, now
Gonna set the roof on fire
Gonna burn this motherfucker down, down, down
Down, d-down, down (C'mon)
Hands up, when the music drops
We both put our hands up
Put your hands on my body
Swear I seen you before
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes

'Cause baby tonight,
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby tonight,
The DJ got us falling in love again (again)
So dance, dance, like it's the last
Last night of your life, life
Gonna get you right
'Cause baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again

Oye Usher, ya tu sabes la jugada

Erikah Badu can get naked then baby
I'm sure that you can
Better holla at Tyrone
Let him know how I jump thru your froot loops
Call that chico a toucan
We're from the blocka blocka oh polaca
Where them boys get loose like waka flaca
Now I'm as global as soccer
Dale flaca
I wanna be your gyno not your doctor
Dale, abre ahi
Papanicolau, baby let me see
Yo soy el Cubanito que está tostadito
¿Yo fresco? no... Ok, maybe un poquitico

'Cause baby tonight,
The DJ got us falling in love again
(Mr. Worldwide, let's take over the world)
Yeah, baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love (dale, go)
Fallin' in love, oh, whoa
So dance, dance, like it's the last
Last night of your life, life
Gonna get you right

'Cause baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
So dance, dance, like it's the last
Last night of your life, life
Gonna get you right
'Cause baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
