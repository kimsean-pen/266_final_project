You can compliment me on the style of my hair
Give me marks out of ten for the clothes I wear
You probably thought I had more upstairs
And I disappoint you, I can see through your perfect smile

He likes to read books written for girls
He prides himself on being a man of the world
In the darkest places he gets his thrills
He will disappoint you if you see through his perfect smile

Now I think separation is okay
You? re no star to guide me anyway
You only wanted me to play a fool
Play by your rule

Now my door has swollen from the rain
God knows we? ll never see her face again
People get shattered in many ways
They can disappoint you if you see through their perfect smile

Now I think separation is okay
'Cause you? re no star to guide me anyway
You only wanted me to play a fool
Play by your rules
A fool
Play by your rules
