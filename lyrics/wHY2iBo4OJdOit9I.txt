Turn it up!
Yeah!
I'm working hard, you're working too
We do it every day
For every minute I have to work
I need a minute of play
Day in day out all week long
Things go better with rock
The only time I turn it down
Is when I'm sleepin it off
Turn up the radio
I need the music, gimmie some more
Turn up the radio
I wanna feel it got to gimmie some more
Now listen!
I wanna shake, I wanna dance
So count it off a'one two three
I feel the beat, I'm in a trance
No better place to be
Daytime nightime, anytime
Things go better with rock
I'm goin' 24 hours a day
I can't seem to stop
Turn up the radio
I need the music, gimmie some more
Turn up the radio
I wanna feel it got to gimmie some more
Turn up the radio
I wanna feel it got to gimmie some more

Turn up the radio
I need the music, gimmie some more
(Yeah!)
Turn up the radio
I wanna feel it got to gimmie some more
(Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!)
Turn up the radio
(Come on!)
I need the music, gimmie some more
(Everybody)
Turn up the radio
(Turn it up!)
I wanna feel it got to gimmie some more
(Whoooooooooooooooooooo!)
Turn up the radio
(Turn it up!)
I need the music, gimmie some more
(Gimmie some more)
Turn up the radio
(Whew! Come on)
I wanna feel it got to gimmie some more
