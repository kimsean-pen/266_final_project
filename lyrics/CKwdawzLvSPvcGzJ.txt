Tonight, you're mine
Completely...
You give your love
So sweetly...

Tonight,
The light
Of love is in your

Eyes...

Will you still love me
Tomorrow?

Is this
A lasting

Treasure
Or just
A moment's
Pleasure?
Can I
Believe
The magic of your
Sighs?
Will you still love me
Tomorrow?
Yeah yeah...
Tonight
With words
Unspoken,
You say that I'm the only one,
The only one...
Yeah.
But will my heart
Be broken
When the night
Meets the morning star?
I'd like to know
That your love
Is love I can
Be sure of!
Ooh woah, yeah.
So tell me now,
Cause I won't ask again,
Will you still love me tomorrow? (Will you still love me tomorrow?)
Will you still love me tomorrow? (Will you still love me tomorrow?)
Ooh, please
Will you still love me tomorrow? (Will you still love me tomorrow?)
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me...
