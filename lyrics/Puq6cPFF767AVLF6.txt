I'm falling
I'm your man

Guess I've been taking a lot from you
Searching so long for the truth

You hoped that girl would chase you out the door,
As you think it - it's already too late

Searching for meaning in a combination of notes...

Don't overthink it, don't overthink it

Tired to wake so early
Get up in the morning it just hurts
And I think of all those little things that you & I can do

And now I've taken too many hits
And I'm breaking off with all that stuff
"Anybody else wants some"?
That's no good reason

Broke up with Edison... I've had enough
Shy, fast times in the park

Don't overthink it

Sorry to wake so early
Get up in the morning it just hurts
I don't wanna hear what I can't mime
Anywhere with you could change my mind

Somebody's taking much too long
Somebody's taking much too long

Don't call me stupid
Don't call me stupid

It's my life and I can't delete it
Is that the life I lead?
All these surreal things and sudden decisions
Just wanna waste my time with you

I will leave it in my dreams

Never let it bother me,
It's not my style

I know you want it
I know you want it

Somebody's taking much too long
Somebody's taking much too long

Don't call me stupid
Don't call me stupid
