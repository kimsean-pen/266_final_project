when the wind takes them all
away from here, away from me
when the sorrow is all gone
it is buried in the soil
when the wind takes em all
away from here away from me
when the sorrow is all gone
it is buried in the sun
when the wolves howl their song
and the whole earth is done
when the wolves howl their song
and the wind still carries on
