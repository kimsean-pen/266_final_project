Shine on, Shine...

What you are, what you are now
what you are what you want to be
I could not break my
Promise to you

There's a sudden change in sound
Cascading words that
Drown you out like
A tidal wave

Like diamonds, we're built with time
We've come a long way to change our minds
Like diamonds, we're built with time
We've come a long way, it such a long wait

Shine on, shine..., up and up we go
To the back, to the back we'll run
Shine on, shine..., up and up we go
To the back, to the back we'll run

What I am, what I am now
I'm a man of something more
I could not break my
Promise to you

There's a constant running thought
That teaches what we
Ought to be but
We'll break away

Like diamonds, we're built with time
We've come a long way to change our minds
Like diamonds, we're built with time
We've come a long way, it such a long wait

Shine on, shine..., up and up we go
To the back, to the back we'll run
Shine on, shine..., up and up we go
To the back, to the back we'll run

Like diamonds, we're built with time
We've come a long way to change our minds
Like diamonds, we're built with time
We've come a long way, it such a long wait

Shine on, shine..., up and up we go
To the back, to the back we'll run
Shine on, shine..., up and up we go
To the back, to the back we'll run
