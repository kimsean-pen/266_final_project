Blue hotel on a lonely highway.
Blue hotel life don't work out my way.
I wait alone each lonely night.
Blue hotel, blue hotel.
Blue hotel every room is lonely.
Blue hotel I was waiting only.
The night and the life of her lonely dream.
Blue hotel, blue hotel.

(Guitar Solo)

Blue hotel on a lonely highway.
Blue hotel life don't work out my way.
I wait alone each lonely night.
Blue hotel, blue hotel.
