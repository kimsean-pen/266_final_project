She puts her makeup on like graffiti on the walls of the heartland
She's got her little book of conspiracies right in her hand
She is paranoid, endangered species headed into extinction
She is one of a kind well, she's the last of the American girls

She wears her overcoat for the coming of the nuclear winter
She is riding her bike like a fugitive of critical mass
She's on a hunger strike for the ones who won't make it for dinner
She makes enough to survive for a holiday of working class
She's a runaway of the establishment incorporated
She won't cooperate well, she's the last of the American girls

She plays her vinyl records, singing songs on the eve of destruction
She's a sucker for all the criminals breaking the laws
She will come in first for the end of Western civilization
She's an endless war, she's a hero for the lost cause
Like a hurricane in the heart of the devastation
She's a natural disaster, she's the last of the American girls

She puts her makeup on like graffiti on the walls of the heartland
She's got her little book of conspiracies right in her hand
She will come in first for the end of Western civilization
She's a natural disaster, she's the last of the American girls
Oh, yeah
Alright
Oh, yeah
