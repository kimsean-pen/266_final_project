I really don't like your point of view
I know you'll never change.
Stingin' me with your attitude
I've got the mind to walk away

I really don't like your arrogance
Or your policies
Ninety-nine percent an embarrassment
But just one quality

I don't mind it when you
Brings out the best in me when you
Show your expertise

When the night always ends with a fight I'm excited
When you wind up next to me
I like it when you

Can I have some please of that
Satisfy my needs
Sometimes I fake that I hate you and make up
And you wind up next to me

I really don't like your skinny jeans
So take them off for me
Show me what you've got underneath
So we can do this properly

I really don't like the way you smile
When you think you're right
But I will forgive you, the yolk is in the middle

And I'm chewin' through the white
'Cause I don't mind it when you
Brings out the best in me when you

Show your expertise
When the night always ends with a fight I'm excited
When you wind up next to me
I like it when you

Can I have some please of that
Satisfy my needs
Sometimes I fake that I hate you and make up

And you wind up next to me
Pretend that you were on a train
You were leaving, you were leaving
It made me think of what I'd miss

And you believe it, you believe it
Pretend that you were on a train
You were leaving, you were leaving
It made me think of what I'd miss
And you believe it, you believe it
I don't mind it when you
Brings out the best in me when you
Show your expertise
When the night always ends with a fight I'm excited
When you wind up next to me
I like it when you
Can I have some please of that
Take off your skinny jeans
Sometimes I fake that I hate you and make up
And you wind up next to me
Pretend that you were on a train
You were leaving, you were leaving
It made me think of what I'd miss
And you believe it, you believe it
