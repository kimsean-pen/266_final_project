Forever ending road
Severed story, suns are no longer
Hollow blackened hole
It's time to surrender this path of existence

Not built to last in this world
With every moment that fades, I get closer
Not built to last in this world, every moment that fades
I claw myself closer to hell
Paying my debt to the Earth
As I turn to dust
Paying my debt to the Earth

Throw me into the flames
As I turn to dust
Throw me into the flames
Throw me into the flames
As I turn to dust
Throw me into the flames

Salt of the Earth
Meaningless, the call has grown stronger
Power overwhelmed
Now detached; the mind has grown shattered
Paying my debt to the Earth
As I turn to dust
Paying my debt to the Earth

Not built to last in this world
With every moment that fades, I get closer
Not built to last in this world
I'm closer, I'm closer to hell
I'm closer to hell

Forever ending road
Severed story, suns are no longer
Hollow blackened hole
It's time to surrender this path of existence

Not built to last in this world
As I turn to dust
Not built to last in this world
I claw myself closer to hell

Throw me into the flames
As I turn to dust
Throw me into the flames
Throw me into the flames
As I turn to dust
Throw me into the flames
