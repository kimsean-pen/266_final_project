Beauty of a frozen night
Will come to take you by the hand
With torment, she will do what's right
Erase the wounds by hands of man
But every soul is not the same
Destroy my kingdom I have built
To fill your heart with lustful shame
Consume your mind with endless guilt

Inner
demons
hold me
closely
Desecration,
they're not
holy
Hidden
hands will
sever
their heads
Lay them
to rest
on their
death bed

Hanging head on sacred ground
Paradise to lands of waste
Cloudy eyes, they make no sounds
Vengeful hearts make no mistakes
Now is the time, summon the saint
The ties that bind are now enslaved
Her scythe will heal, their blood as paint
Our holy death is not afraid

Inner
demons
hold me
closely
Desecration,
they're not
holy
Hidden
hands will
sever
their heads
Lay them
to rest
on their
death bed
