I never will
Wipe the blood away from your eyes
I never could
Tell the truth when there are still some lies

Burn down all the halls, then destroy
I want to show it to you
Tear down all the walls, then enjoy
(I want to push it through

Invite the light
When blood stains blondes tonight

Halo
Will I carry the ring
Halo
Do the perfect thing
Blood stains blondes

You've always said
That time will wound yet all will heal
You always will,
Swallow my lies with a twist of steel

Cut deep into the flesh, ride the spikes
(I want to show it to you
Lick hard the open wounds, slay the lights
I want to push it through

Invite the light
When blood stains blondes tonight

Halo
Will I carry the ring
Halo
Do the perfect thing
Blood stains blondes!

The model is the serpent
The alibi is the saint
The object is the martyr
The blood is paint
