Say the talk and I won't mind
There's cause you know I'll never try
And I love you like the one I used to know
And if you never had the time
That's an ordinary problem
And I say I'd like to have a place to go

And you held and you tried
I could never find another
If you walk me to the car park
I won't go
To my left I saw time
Flash and fall it seemed to swallow you
I could love you like the sister
I never had

Drawing circles in your concrete
I will know your every move
And I'll send you
I'll send you

And you held and you tried
I could never find another
If you walk me to the car park
I won't go
And we held and we tried
There was heart and lust between us
I will love you
I won' let go

'Cause we are one inside these walls
Undercover
We are one inside these walls
Undercover
We are one inside these walls
Undercover
We are
We are one

And you held and you tried
I could never find another
If you walk me to the car park
I won't go
And we held and we tried
There was heart and lust between us
I will love you
I won't let go

We are one (undercover)
We are one (undercover)
We are one (undercover)
We are one
