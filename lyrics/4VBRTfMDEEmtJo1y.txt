I prefer the lights out, even though its just for you
And now theres nothing I can hide from you
But I'll do it for you

It's so wrong together
It's so wrong forever
It's so wrong together
It's so wrong

In my dreams for so long
I can barely contain this flash of lightning
And I know I was blinded
It had barely begun
And already over

It's so wrong together
It's so wrong forever
It's so wrong together
It's so wrong

It's so wrong together
It's so wrong forever
It's so wrong together
It's so wrong
