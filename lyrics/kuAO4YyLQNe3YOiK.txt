Life
it's ever so strange
it's so full of change
think that you've worked it out
then bang
right out of the blue
somethin' happens to you
to throw you off course and then you
breakdown
yeah, you breakdown
well don't you, breakdown
listen to me.

Because, it's just a ride, it's just a ride
no need to run, no need to hide
it'll take you round and round
sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down
it's just a ride, it's just a ride
don't be scared, don't hide your eyes
it may feel so real inside
but don't forget, it's just a ride.

Truth
we don't wanna hear (don't wanna hear)
it's too much to take (too much to take)
don't like to feel out of control
so we make our plans (we make our plans)
ten times a day (ten times a day)
and when they don't go our way we
breakdown
yeah, we breakdown
well don't you, breakdown
listen to me.

Because, it's just a ride, it's just a ride
no need to run, no need to hide
it'll take you round and round
sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down
it's just a ride, it's just a ride
don't be scared, don't hide your eyes
it may feel so real inside
but don't forget, it's just a ride.

Slowly
oh so very slowly
except that
there's no getting off. So live it
just gotta go with it. 'Cause this ride's
never gonna stop (stop, stop, stop).

Breakdown
don't you breakdown
no need to breakdown
no need at all.

Because, it's just a ride, it's just a ride
no need to run, no need to hide
it'll take you all around
sometimes you're up
sometimes you're down
it's just a ride, it's just a ride
don't be scared
now dry your eyes
it may feel so real inside
but don't forget enjoy the ride.

It's just a ride, it's just a ride
no need to run, no need to hide
it'll take you all around
sometimes you're up
sometimes you're down
it's just a ride, it's just a ride
don't be scared
now dry your eyes
it may feel so real inside
but don't forget enjoy the ride.
