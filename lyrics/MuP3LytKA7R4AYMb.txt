Line up to the ring for a battle that you can't win.
Swing as hard as you can swing
it will still mean nothing.
Should've seen it coming.
It had to happen sometime
but you went and brought a knife to an all-out gun fight
and the only thing that's safe is the banner that you wave
to be wrapped around your grave.

You've gone too far.
Who do you think you are?
Is this what you came for?
Well, this means war.

Say anything you want, but that's not gonna get you nowhere.
The only thing you brought is psychological warfare.
There's no giving up, now You got to wonder
who will dig you out when you're six feet under?
If the only thing that's safe is the banner that you wave
to be wrapped around your grave.

You've gone too far.
Who do you think you are?
Is this what you came for?
Well, this means war
If the only thing that's safe is the banner that you wave

to be wrapped around your grave.
You've gone too far.
Who do you think you are?
Is this what you came for?
Well, this means war
Well, this means war
