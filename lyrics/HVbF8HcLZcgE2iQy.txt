There was a time that I still felt love now I
Don't know you, but I got a trail of thoughts
That keep us connected and blue
Now I'm at the elevation from a different view
Looking at the haze we once were
I'm diving back into you

I been
Diving, diving, diving
I been
Silent, ooo, diving back into you
I been
Diving, diving, diving
I been
Silent, ooo, diving back into you

I took off and touched the window like I
Touched the sky
Don't you think we've both gone higher
I hope you got some peace of mind
No one says your name in circles that I keep
But it's the same three blocks
And the same two streets

I been
Diving, diving, diving
I been
Silent, ooo, diving back into you
I been
Diving, diving, diving
I been
Silent, ooo, diving back into you

I fell in love
Into your heart
Every last drop
Filling up empty spaces
I fell in love
Looking up lost
Wondering how we got here, baby
I fell in love
Connecting those dots
All of my thoughts
Follow our constellations
I fell in love
Wherever you are
You know I been diving into you

I been
Diving, diving, diving
I been
Silent, ooo, diving back into you
I been
Diving, diving, diving
I been
Silent, ooo, diving back into you

(I fell in love)
