There's a path running under the city
Where the stones and the hills divide
There's a path we can walk through the loss and the pity
She's out of the light, she thought it'd be safer
She said I wanna go home
Eyes turn grey like her face in the paper
She said I wanna go home

There's a girl sleeping under the river
Where the snow and the rain collide
There's a girl that we watch and we'll soon be with her
She's out of the light, she doesn't remember
She said I wanna go home
Face turns white like a sky in December
She said I wanna go home
I wanna go home

There's a black house burning in the moonlight
We're standing at the door and there's no one in sight
This will all be over tonight

There's something in the dark and I wanna go home
There's someone else here, we're not alone
This will all be over tonight

There's a place we can all be together
Where the moon and the stars reside
There's a place we can go where we'll sleep forever
We're out of the light, we'll never remember
Do you wanna go home?

There's a black house burning in the moonlight
We're standing at the door and there's no one in sight
This will all be over tonight

There's something in the dark and I wanna go home
There's someone else here, we're not alone
This will all be over tonight
