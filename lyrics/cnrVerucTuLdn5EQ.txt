I hear you're taking the town again
Havin' a good time
With all your good-time friends
I don't think that you think of me
You're on your own now
And I'm alone and free

I know that I should get on with my life
But a life lived without you
Could never be right

As long as the stars shine down
>From the heavens
Long as the rivers run
To the sea
I'll never get over you

Getting over me

I try to smile so the hurt won't show
Tell everybody
That I was glad to see you go

But the tears just won't go away
(Won't go away.)
Loneliness found me

Looks like it's here to stay
I know that I oughta find someone new
But all I find is myself
Always thinkin' of you
Oh!
No matter what I do
Each night's a lifetime to live through
I can't go on like this
(I need your touch)
You're the only one I'll ever love)
Oh, oh. ah...
Ooh...
Ooh...
Ooh...
And as
Long as the stars shine down
From the heavens
Long as the rivers run
To the sea
I'll never get over you
Getting over me
I'll never get over you
Getting over
Never get over you...
Getting over
I'll never get over you
Getting over me
