Sung by jim

Did you do it good
Did you do it right
Did you get that pain
Crawling up your spine
Did you feel the heat
Of my sugar ray
Swear I saw that light
Shining on your face
All my friends have fun with guns
But all I want is you
All I want is you
All I want

Did you read my poem
Did you get my poem
Did it break your bones
Almost broke my bones
Did you feel my lips
Did they slide and slip
Did you feel my head
Shaking through your wrist

Sugar through your ray
All those boys have fun with sores
But all I want is you
All I want is you
All I want
Is you

Darling you're so good
Oh if felt so good
Did you feel that heat
Did you feel the heat
Of my sugar ray
Sugar ray
I almost died
Died died died died
Come enjoy
All I want is you
All I want is you
All I want
Is you

Baby give me
Sugar ray
