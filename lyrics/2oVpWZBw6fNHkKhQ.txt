Friend of mine
I've tried a revolution
Everyone screaming

"It's not fair
It's not fair"
I'll play the Romeo

You play the Juliet
The sun won't set, until you appear
'Cause I know you're the one my love
My love, my love

What light through this window breaks?
So bright, so bright
My love just for one more day
So bright, you're so bright
Fall (fall) fast (fast)
The course of love never did run smooth

I'll try
I'll try to dream on my own tonight
We will meet in the moonlight
Meet in the moonlight
We will meet in the moonlight
Meet in the moonlight!

This is not pretend, don't play the end

I know you're real & not just a book I read
Soon, I will show you
How a heart can never fail, never change
I'll never change
I'll show you the sun can never, never change
I'll never, never change
If music be the food of love, play on
Play on
If music be the food of love, play on
Play on
