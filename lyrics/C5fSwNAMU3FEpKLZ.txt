The sky is gray
Everything has changed
World is not as it was before

Take a deep a breath
Is like cutting your own skin
The air is not as it was before

And now simple smiles have their own copyrights
And people are out of cash

Looking for the last trademark
To fulfill what I have inside
My emptiness

Trying to find love outside
But all I got is styrofoam
In red pigment

Is that what you wanted?
The future is dark
And tastes like plastic

The invisible hand has brought us here
And every move was predicted
Now look arround. What we have made?
This world is just like a no man's land

And now your smiles are also copyrighted
There's still time to change your mind

Looking for the last trademark
To fulfill what I have inside
My emptiness

Trying to find love outside
But all I got is styrofoam
In red pigment

I'll keep looking for the trademark
That will fulfill what I have inside
My emptiness

Maybe I'll find love inside
Between all this styrofoam
Painted in red

My emptiness
My emptiness
My emptiness
My emptiness
