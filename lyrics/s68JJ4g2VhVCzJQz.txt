Blue Boy, worried 'bout the world's eyes
Worried, every time the sun shines

Worried
About his
Haircut

Calm down
Sweetheart
Grow up

Blue Boy
Blue Boy
Blue Boy
Blue Boy

Blue Boy, older than the world knows
Honey, that's the way that life goes

No use
Actin'
So tough

Calm down
Sweetheart
Grow up

Blue Boy
Blue Boy
Blue Boy
Blue Boy
