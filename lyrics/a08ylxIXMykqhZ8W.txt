I chew imaginary gum
I own a replica gun
We've flown away from home
We're sending the drones

I study military maps
It helps me relax? when I'm sending in the drones
Oh

Ruffians are on parade, whoah-whoah
Ruffians are on parade, whoah-whoah
Like the last stand of the day
We lost more than we saved
At weekly meetings
We go on parade

I write on the walls
Of your? and stalls
We've flown away from home
We're sending the drones

I got the head of a stag
A confederate flag? when I'm sending in the drones

Ruffians are on parade, whoah-whoah
Ruffians are on parade, whoah-whoah
In the dark of the arcade
We spend more than we made
At weekly meetings
We go on parade

We're never backing down
We'll never be alone again
We are never backing down
Eleven million miles away from home

Ruffians are on parade, whoah-whoah
Ruffians are on parade, whoah-whoah
At a last stand of the day
We lost more than we saved
At weekly meetings
We go on parade

Ruffians are on parade, whoah-whoah
Ruffians are on parade, whoah-whoah
Like the last stand of the day
We lost more than we saved
And in the dark of the arcade
We spend more than we made
At weekly meetings
Early evenings
After eating
We go on parade
