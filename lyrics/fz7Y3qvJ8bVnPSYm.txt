You've had your thumb on me too long
I'm so confused on right from wrong
You cripple every thought of mine
The damage leaves me in denial

Slowly finding the light that you've stolen
Finally looking to purge all the poison
Leaving while I can stand
When you watch me dig out from under your skin

Don't wait up, don't waste your time
You know I'm never coming home
Feed me lies
A crooked smile is all I feel I've ever known

Simple minded soul of mine
Waited too long to leave you behind
Always felt you in my way
A weightless chain beneath my feet

Slowly finding the light that you've stolen
Finally looking to purge all the poison
Leaving while I can stand
When you watch me dig out from under your skin

Don't wait up, don't waste your time
You know I'm never coming home
Feed me lies
A crooked smile is all I feel I've ever known

You lost yourself so long ago
Waited too long for darkness to take hold
You hate yourself, I hate you more
All the anger, I can't seem to let it go
Won't let you feed me lies
Won't let you feed me lies
So watch me dig
So watch me dig away from this

Don't wait up, don't waste your time
You know I'm never coming home
Feed me lies
A crooked smile is all I feel I've ever known
Don't wait up, don't waste your time
You know I'm never coming home
Feed me lies
A crooked smile is all I feel I've ever known

Won't let you feed me lies
Won't let you feed me lies
