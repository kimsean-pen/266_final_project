Impromptu party invitee
We bring it on and reek sexy
We do it good we do it right
We do it loose we keep it tight

We are hot and you are not
We get everything that we want
We are young and you are not
We get everything that we want

MILK IT

Raise your glass and dim the lights
And we're killing every need all night and
Disco love I'll live your life life
Oh Oh Oh Oh I I I

Beach house, yes I'll take a ride on that yacht
Give it all to us cause we are what you are not
Everybody (???) loves this West Coast gig
Everybody wants to be a member of this clique

We are hot and you are not
We get everything that we want
We are young and you are not
We get everything that we want

MILK IT

Raise your glass and dim the lights
And we're killing every need all night and
Disco love I'll live your life life
Oh Oh Oh Oh I I I

All we know is superficial
It's all we've been exposed to
Please forgive our mass ignorance
We'll have to Google it later

We are hot and you are not
We get everything that we want
We are young and you are not
We get everything that we want
We are sex and you are not
We got everything that you want

MILK IT

Raise your glass and dim the lights
And we're killing every need all night and
Disco love I'll live your life life
Oh Oh Oh Oh I I I
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh I I I
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh I I I

We are hot and you are not
We get everything that we want
We are young and you are not
We get everything that we want
We are sex and you are not
We got everything that you want
We are femme and muscled too
And everything that's in between

MILK IT

Raise your glass and dim the lights
And we're killing every need all night and
Disco love I'll live your life life
Oh Oh Oh Oh I I I

Oh Oh Oh Oh I I
Oh Oh Oh Oh
I I I
