Meeting Mr. Right, the man of my dreams
The one who showed me true love, or at least it seems

With brown cocoa skin and curly black hair
It's just the way he looks at me that gentle loving stare
Finally! you've come along
The way I feel about you, it just can't be wrong

If you only knew the way I feel about you
I just can't describe it, oh no no
Finally it is happened to me
Right in front of my face

My feelings can't describe it
Finally it is happened to me
Right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it
Finally it is happened to me
Right in front of my face

My feelings can't describe it
Finally it is happened to me
Right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it
It seems so many times
He seemed to be the one

But all he ever wanted was to have a little fun
But now you've come along
And brightened up my world
In my heart I feel it, I'm that special kind of girl
Finally! you've come along
The way I feel about you, it just can't be wrong
If you only knew, the way I feel about you

I just can't describe it, oh no no
Finally! it is happened to me
Right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it

Finally it is happened to me
Right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it
Finally it is happened to me
Right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it

Finally it is happened to me
Right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it
Finally
Oh, finally yeah yeah
Finally it is happened to me
Right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally it is happened to me
Right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it
Finally oh yeah
yeah, eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
finally, oh yeah
