Thought I saw you
Payphone on rocker
Michelle, I still want to give in
I'd understand if you knit

How long must we live right
Before we don't even have to try?
Wa-wa-wa
Wa-wa-wa

Note from your daughter
Drawing of three flowers
I still keep it with me
Does she still want to sing?

How long must we live right
Before we don't even have to try?
Wa-wa-wa
Wa-wa-wa

I hear the sound of a million drums
With no, no beat
Violins with no melody
I'm sick with it
Quiet

I don't blame you for wanting out
I'm kind of closed myself
No love, no amount
Never enough to go around
