Strophe 1:

There's so much wrong in your life
and you wish you could turn back time
no time for sorrow, no time to regret
you're drowning in the sands of time

But life goes on day by day,
and all the faults will remain.

You walk away,
you walk away.
from the place you left before without me.
There is nothing, that will make you stay.

You walk away,
you walk away.
from the place you left before
you won't go back, 'cause there's nothing more for you to say.

Ohhh... Ohhh... Ohhh... Ohhh...

Strophe 2:

You keep all the memories in your heart.
You know they will keep you from be a free.
You walk with the devil deep inside,
as long as you're not able to forget.

But life goes on day by day,
and all the faults will remain.

You walk away,
you walk away.
from the place you left before without me.
There is nothing, that will make you stay.

You walk away,
you walk away.
from the place you left before
you won't go back, 'cause there's nothing more for you to say.

Ohhh...
Ohhh...
You walk away,
you walk away.

You walk away,
you walk away.
from the place you left before without me.
There is nothing, that will make you stay.

You walk away,
you walk away.
from the place you left before
you won't go back, 'cause there's nothing more for you to say.

You walk away.
