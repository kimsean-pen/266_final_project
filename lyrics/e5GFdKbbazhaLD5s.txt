Play me a song that's accompanied by
Powerful and delicate
Stabs at your insides
Save for the weakness, I'm more then alive
I'm used to all that yellowness that's leaking from your spine

Before you decide where to lie
Can't you tell how impressed I am?
It's not going to kill you to try and repent
For your sins

Maybe the point is I'm totally fine
Now that you're not relevant
The elephant can die
Put it to rest just as soon as you like
Get used to no one helping you
You're perfectly unkind

Before you decide where to lie
Can't you tell how impressed I am?
It's not going to kill you to try and repent
For your sins

But it's not worth troubling
It's not worth troubling
It's not worth...
I confess everything

Before you decide where to lie
Can't you tell how impressed
It's not going to kill you to try and repent
For your sins

But it's not worth troubling yourself
