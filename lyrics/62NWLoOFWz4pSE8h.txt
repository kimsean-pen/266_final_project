There's no journey
There's no safe place
For the heart to hang
When the body's no good

Am I meant to fray the end?
On the outside looking in
I used up
I've used enough

To me love was
Always in pain
Stolen moment
At a time

A feeling only out
For a little while
And then ripped from your arms
Like a child

I carry their names
The secret shapes
An aching drape
Around my heart

Traced in the park
Now lined in chark
We're out to kiss
In the mind, for a little while, everything was alright
