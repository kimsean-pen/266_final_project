Saint of barges
Queen of nails
Sparkling drum sets
And murders of crows

Metal teeth of
Carousels
Lighting cigars on
Electric chairs

Buildings are rooks
Nature's a vice
Rattle of diesels
Snakes eating their own tails

Pretty girl, milkin' a cow, oh yeah
Pretty girl, milkin' a cow, oh yeah
Pretty girl, milkin' a cow, oh yeah
Pretty girl, milkin' a cow, oh yeah
