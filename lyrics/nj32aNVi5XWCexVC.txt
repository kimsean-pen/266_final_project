My baby left and he ain't got a word to say
I guess it ain't his day
Not his day today
But he's magnificent, honestly
I wish you could see all the things that I see

'Cause it's all in his smile
It's all in the way he dies for me
He'd die for me, honestly
When we're riding in his car
He whispers 'honey, you're a star'
And I love that he lies to me
'Cause he always lies to me

Singing Ooh
He's got me singing Ooh
He's got me singing Ooh

I don't give a fuck if he's bad for me
I know he's bad for me
But he brings me peace
And he's spectacular, honestly
You could never see all the things that I see

'Cause it's all in his smile
It's all in the way he dies for me
And he'd die for me, honestly
When we're riding in his car
He whispers 'baby, you look the part'
I love that he lies to me
'Cause he always lies to me

Singing Ooh
He's got me singing Ooh
He's got me singing Ooh

You know that he'd die for me, cry for me, lie to me
Why do these people think that I see differently?
You know that I'd die for him, cry for him, lie to him
Why do these people think that he sees differently?

He's got me singing Ooh
He's got me singing Ooh

You know that he'd die for me, cry for me, lie to me
Why do these people think that I see differently?
See him differently, see him differently
You know that I'd die for him, cry for him, lie to him
Why do these people think that he sees differently?
