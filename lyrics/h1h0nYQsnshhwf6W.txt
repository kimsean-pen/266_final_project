Partaking from the grail of death
Perfumed with the odour of serpent saliva
As bitterness hangs to and in the throat
Breathing in the mesmerizing vapours

Unblocking the burning gateways
To that which manifests within
A ripple in the brackish vision
Expanding deeper in a trance

Where no dream is without a cost
Where nothing is in everything
To be the prophet, to be in Him
In life dead to this world

In transition to the divine
At each sound of prayers vibrating
At each step closer trembling
To drown in sterile waters
Pilgrimage to the primeval womb
Formless and unthinkable
Cleansing in death communion
Dissolved in consecration
In the depth of darkness unveiled

Where no dream is without a cost
Where nothing is in everything
To be the prophet, to be in Him
In life dead to this world
I follow one star
The one of them most dormant
Yet the brightest of them all
