Now the night is coming to an end
Oooooohhhh
The sun will rise and we will try again
Oooooohhhh

Stay alive, stay alive for me
You will die, but now your life is free
Take pride in what is sure to die

I will fear the night again
Oooooohhhh
I hope I'm not my only friend
Oooooohhhh

Stay alive, stay alive for me
You will die, but now your life is free
Take pride in what is sure to die
