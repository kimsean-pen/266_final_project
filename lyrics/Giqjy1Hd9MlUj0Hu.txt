As often as always evolution is crawling from the sea,
Alive with urgency like suicide, like suicide,
Convinced the grass is greener on dry earth;

The march of serrated utterance like a soft cough
Muffled murmur sneaking through the lecture hall.
The crawl across the island, the sound of waves;
Embodied water sprouting legs as loud as gallop,...

All the young people who took a leap without faith into a riverbed
That drowns about as much as it saves.

...Cuffing down on ground against the cries of gravity.

Belly-up, half buried in the sand.
Extend a hand to the smallness of death.
Understand that only dying is this colossal
Creation shedding skin to find a perfect equilibrium like fossils.

All the young people who took a leap of no faith...
All the young cowards acting out...
All the young cowards acting out for the brave forever hurled
Into the waters of their indifferent graves.

For a million years raise your glass
We will never answer where we came from...
For a million years raise your glass in cheers
We will never answer where we came from only how we got...
For a million years raise your glass
We will never answer where we came from...
For a million years raise your glass
...only how we got here.

(Two minutes, and the lads are in for a surprise)
