Oh Ohhh, oh ohhhh
I can't wake up
See me running 'round the corner, move me up into the upswing
Call me undone
When I speak about the truth, I'm only brought up to the downbeat

It's not easy there
When you feel the wear
Patience brings the tear
Oh, oh, oh

Everyday do you notice that we're never free?
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?
Everyday we are running round trapped in our seat
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?

Oh ohhhh, oh ohhhh
Oh why can't you be
Happy with me

Pushing paper
I do everything I'm told, and yeah, I do it for the money
Understating
Every action that I take until I know there's something coming

It's not easy there
When you feel the wear
Patience brings the chair
Oh, oh, oh

Everyday do you notice that we're never free?
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?
Everyday we are running round trapped in our seat
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?
Everyday do you notice that we're never free?
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?
Everyday we are running round trapped in our seat
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?

The messages won't stop, they just keep pulling at you
Teasing us with the thought that that is something we'll do
If we could hold the tongue and focus all our time through
We would just rise above this cycle that we're bound to

Everyday do you notice that we're never free?
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?
Everyday we are running
Everyday we are running
Everyday, everyday, everyday...

Everyday do you notice that we're never free?
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?
Everyday we are running round trapped in our seat
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?
Everyday do you notice that we're never free?
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?
Everyday we are running round trapped in our seat
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?
Everyday do you notice that we're never free?
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?
Everyday we are running round trapped in our seat
Oh, why can't you be happy with me?
