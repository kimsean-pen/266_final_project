There is a big tree in my garden
a big tree in my garden
in the winter it protect me from the snow
in the summer it get to me some shadow
in the spring he give to me some sweet fruits
During the autumn on the branches all the leaves are gone

The big tree in my garden
There is a big tree in my garden
He was already hundred years old when I'm born
Already hundred years when old I'm born

A tree without roots cannot live
but a tree without your branches shall not grow
