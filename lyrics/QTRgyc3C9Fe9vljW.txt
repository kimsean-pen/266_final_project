Wisp of smoke, lifeless tomb
Ritual has yet begun
Awakes from haunted sleep
Eons burned the abyssinian sun
Empress rising rumors toll
Spirit weed invigorates bones
Whispered voice through halls of gloom
Where none that lives can walk alone

Severed hand, dust and stone
Blinded eyes have seen to eternity
Skull of wicked crone
Mind is bludgeoned to insanity
Nocturnal infant's gaze
Circles twine to what will come
Sacrificial dreams
Waking curse of the nameless one

Empress rising
