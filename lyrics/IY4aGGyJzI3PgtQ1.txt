I wanted to match your glow with an apple that i taught regret
but you smashed that fruit and you spat on my shoes
and you drew an airplane flying through my head
i might as well be dead
let those fireflies chew off my legs
cause i don't wanna ever dance no more

i wanted to make you swoon with a light bulb that i taught to fly
but you took that bulb and you chewed it to a pulp
and you spat out fifty full grown fireflies
but it was all a lie
those fireflies are made out of dust
and i don't wanna watch them glow no more

i wanted to make you cry with a cowboy that i taught restraint
but you snapped him in two and you buttered his boots
and you threw him out into the pouring rain
well it really ruined my day
i had to glue him back together again
and i don't think he'll ever dance no more
