My one heart hurt another
So only one life can't be enough
Can you give me just another
For that one who got away

There'll be no rest for the wicked
There's no song for the choir
There's no hope for the weary
If you let them win without a fight

I let my good one down
I let my true love die
I had his heart but I broke it every time

My one heart hurt another
So only one life can't be enough
Can you give me just another
For that one who got away
Lonely, I
I'm so alone now

There'll be no rest for the wicked
There's no song for the choir
There's no hope for the weary
If you let them win without a fight

There'll be no rest for the wicked
There's no song for the choir
There's no hope for the weary
If you let them win without a fight
