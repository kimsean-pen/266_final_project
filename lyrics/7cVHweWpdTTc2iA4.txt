Yea we doing this shit. Friday the 13th in this mother fucker, what's good man?

Bust a mother fucker's head open with a lead pipe
Rob a mother fucker at a red light
Bitch, if you dead wrong then that means I'm dead, right?
Shining like a light in the night full of fright
Head full of lead
Told that bitch put them meds in your Keds because them Feds be inspecting my bread
Them docs be inspecting my head
Told me there's nothing but cobwebs and lead
I'm a psycho up under your bed
Creeping and crawling
I'm stalking the sleeping
My target has weakened
I'm seeking a carcass to sleep in, wearing its bones around my neck
Hop in the deep end
Heart never beating
Scythe in my hand, bitch, I sow what I'm reaping
Slaughter the sheep and I drain out the blood
Fill up my cup, yeah I'm sipping the flood

Tell ya bitch pick her lip up
She look again then she getting fucked
Ten feet of that sticky stick
Riding round with my new bitch
It's that mystic prince on that Triple 6
Sitting back with my crucifix
Put that hoe face in a pillow, I'm that scarecrow in your window
Ain't no witness in the dark
Body parts and eating hearts
Robbers, killers, cocaine dealers
Leave these fuck boys shaking looking in the face of Satan
Sold my soul, fuck the cost
Robbing these bitches and making my riches
Bitch, I swallow crucifixes, Ahhh!

Damn son, where'd ya find this?
