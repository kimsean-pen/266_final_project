The time has finally come you get a mouth full
You only act on greed and by your actions this is proof
And can't you see the flowers dying all around you
Got your hands in the devils pockets
Got everything to lose

And so you lash out
To crush the ones below
Cuz they are the ones that you fear most
And you call this crowd control well let me break it down for you

The fire in your veins
is just a joke you tell yourself
Another way to cut the cost
To hide your face from all the guilt

And it's a shame to have to say
You had to kill to gain control again
But at least you made some money
Hey, let the good times roll

And it's your dream to be the king of all creation
As far as I'm concerned you've hung your shadow on the wall
And though your fingers never really pulled the trigger
Your hands are just as guilty, you're the one who bought the blood

Again you lash out
To hush the ones who know
Cuz they are the ones that you fear most
And it's called crowd control
Well let me break it down for you

Oh my the greed has now consumed you
Your eyes fade as you fall into the ocean
You move fast to feed your lust for money
You dive down now your caught in the commotion
All this and you trade it in for nothing
A cheap lie you put it in your pocket
All this and you trade it in for nothing
Oh my I can see your heart has met it's end

Say hello to Judas
