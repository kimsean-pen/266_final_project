Doing fine all on my own
'Cause I know that this was right for me
Now you're feeling all alone
I heard you're sorry now but that's what you wanted
You took me for granted all the time

Had to save my own self from all your evil games
And now it ain't the same
You will have no such luck to try to come inside
It is to be denied

Tie my heartstrings, I tie my heartstrings off
Tie my heartstrings, I tie my heartstrings off

Now you know I'm doing well
You try to catch me when I'm finally free
You only did this to yourself
I bet you're sorry now but that's what you wanted
You took me for granted all the time

Had to save my own self from all your evil games
And now it ain't the same
You will have no such luck to try to come inside
That is to be denied

Tie my heartstrings, I tie my heartstrings off
Tie my heartstrings, I tie my heartstrings off
Tie my heartstrings, I tie my heartstrings off
Tie my heartstrings, I tie my heartstrings off

I was fighting for you
Now I'm fine without you
For you ever knew
