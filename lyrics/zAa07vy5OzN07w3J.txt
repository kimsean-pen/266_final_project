Golden light that touches my eyes
And the sun that warms my bones
There's a comfort in this soothing air
With a hope I've longed to know
Cause as days go by, life intensifies
And the pain always stays
I always thought we were a moving tide
Never crashing on the way

I don't know what it means
What this life has made for me
I don't know what life would be
Without you, it's not for me

I didn't want to believe
I didn't want to think
That our dreams were all gone
I couldn't stand on my feet
I couldn't walk in the street
I was always falling down

I don't know what life would be
Without you
I feel so weak

I don't know what life would be
Without you
I'd hardly breath

I don't know what it means
What this life has made for me
I don't know what life would be
Without you, it's not for me
Not for me
Not for me

If I could feel your warm soul next to me
Then I don't care what life brings
Only you, is all I need
And I don't know what it means
What this life has made for me
But I don't care what it brings
As long as you are there with me
