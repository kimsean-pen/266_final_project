Lost in my mind
When a path is hard to find
I'm captured by the dark
I'm trapped in an illusion

Left on my own
The world empty and alone
In an eternal sleep
You've come awaken me

Through the battle and the glory
You're the hero in my story
Shining brightly, you are my superstar

You're my light, you're my torch
You are my guide through the dark
Shining brightly, you are my superstar
Yeah, yeah

You tore down my walls
You fought your way inside
Wrapped tightly around me
And carry me to safety

You whisper in my ear
So only I can hear
Your hands will hold me tight
On my piece you will find

Through the battle and the glory
You're the hero in my story
Shining brightly, you are my superstar

You're my light, you're my torch
You are my guide through the dark
Shining brightly, you are my superstar
Yeah, yeah

Shout out the negative and see
Shout out all the nightmares underneath
You are the reason why I'm free

You're afraid to lose my voice
All I hear is a loud noise
You breathing into me
You hear when no one's listening

You know this song
You're the only harmony
When I lost my melody
You sing it back to me

Through the battle and the glory
You're the hero in my story
Shining brightly, you are my superstar

You're my light, you're my torch
You are my guide through the dark
Shining brightly, you are my superstar
Yeah, yeah

Through the battle and the glory
You're the hero in my story
Shining brightly, you are my superstar

You're my light, you're my torch
You are my guide through the dark
Shining brightly, you are my superstar
Yeah, yeah
