Uh, oh, uh, oh, here I go again, baby, baby
I hear your name and it's like I'm breaking, aching
You still got that power hanging over me
It's always over but still happening
Uh, oh, uh, oh, here I go again, baby, baby

I just wanna scream out 'til my voice breaks
Even if the tears fall and my heart hates me
Baby, I love you

Uh, oh, uh, oh, don't know how I'm still breathing, breathing (I'm breathing)
I got this hole up in my heart, baby, baby
And it doesn't matter what no one say
Even though it's broken, I love you anyway
Uh, oh, oh, here I go again, baby, baby (my baby)

I just wanna scream out 'til my voice breaks
Even if the tears fall and my heart hates me (ooh, whoa)
I just wanna know how I can save me
Even if these three words choke and take me
Baby, I love you (I love you)

I feel your touch when I'm alone at night (I love you, I love you)
Ooh (I love you), but it's just me (I love you) who's holding tight (I love you, I love you)
And this life don't feel like you, no (I love you, I love you)
Ooh (I love you), there's nothing left (I love you) but these I love yous

And I just wanna scream out 'til my voice breaks
Even if the tears fall and my heart hates me, yeah
I just wanna know how I can save me (I just wanna know)
Even if these three words choke and (ooh) take me
Baby, I love you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I love you
Baby, I love you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I love you
Baby, I love you
