There was a time when we were down and out.
There was a place when we were starting over.
We let the bough break
we let the heartache in

Who's sorry now?
There was a world when we were standing still -
And for a moment we were separated. -
And then you found her
you let the stranger in

Who's sorry now
who's sorry now?
What
what kind of fool tears it apart

Leaving me pain and sorrow -
Losin' you now

Wondering why.
Where will I be tomorrow?

There was a time when we were down and out
What
what kind of fool tears it apart

Leaving me pain and sorrow -
Losin' you now.
How can I win
Were will I be tomorrow?

Was there a moment when I cut you down

Played around.
What have I done only apoligize for being as they say
The last to know
It has to show when someone is in your eyes.
What kind of fool tears it apart
