Love is weird, love

She's overdone it, can't go on
She caused it all, cry, cry wolf
She didn't know, she didn't want it
She does a lot of things and regrets it

Love can hurt, love
Love is weird, love

A girl who wants it but has no clue
She's says she'll give it, cry, cry wolf
A change of mind in a back seat or that dirty room
They say she got just what she wanted

Love can be bad
Love is weird, love

You shoulda known better
You shoulda known better
You shoulda known, it's all your fault
You shoulda known better
You should know better

Didn't they tell you?
Didn't they tell you?

Cry, cry wolf
Cry, cry wolf
Cry, cry wolf
