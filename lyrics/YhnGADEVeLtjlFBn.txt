I pick up the phone
I'm dialing your number
while I pray you're at home
at home and alone
'cause I can't function on my own
And I'll never stop believing

The REAPING is done
You are the one
The radio is on but the sound is off gone
And I wanna walk out in the sun
But lately that's been very hard to do
I've got a thing about you
And I don't really know what to do

'cause I've got a thing about you
Hey you
I pick up the phone
I'm DIALING that number and

my heart like a stone
waits for the tone
Oh I can't make it on my own
And I'll never stop believing
I know what is right and this is so wrong
Alone in my bed, better off on my own

The TV is on but the colours are gone
And lately you've been painting my world blue
I've got a thing about you
(I've got a thing about you)
And I don't really care what you do
I've got a thing about you

(I've got a thing about you)
Hey you
I've got a thing about you
I've got a thing about you-ou-ou-ou
Lately you've been painting my world blue
I've got a thing about you

(I've got a thing about you)
And I don't really know what to do

I've got a thing about you
Hoping this story cuts through

(this story cuts through)
Yea, I've got a thing about you
A thing about you
I've got a thing about you
I've got a thing about you-ou-ou-ou
And I don't really know what to do
I've got a thing about you (I've got a thing about you)
I've got a thing about you (I've got a thing about you-ou-ou-ou)
