I put some words on this melody you might like
I put some words on this melody you like
Its getting cold again the summer light was almost here
Dance with me before it gets cold

Alone already summer was almost here
I didn't tell you, but I know I look for the season
Let's smile, drink, and dance together
Don't be there that's not your place

I'm afraid of making new memories without you
I'm afraid of making new memories without you
I had a variety of this bar, can't keep down in my mind
I'm so tired and can't dry my eyes

Alone already summer was almost here
Tell me a story you are dreaming of now
Well we waited for you when it gets cold
You know the place our cozy bar

Wish our summer could be longer
Wish this summer could be a little more
Let's smile, drink, and dance together
You know the place our bar

Alone already this summer was almost here
Tell me a story you are dreaming of now
Well we waited for you when it gets cold
You know the place our cozy bar
Our cozy bar
