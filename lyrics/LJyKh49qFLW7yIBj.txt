Don't be aroused by my confession
Unless you don't give a good goddamn about redemption
I know Christ is comin', and so am I
And you would too if this sexy devil caught your eye

She'll suck you dry
and still you'll cry, to be back in her bosom
To do it again
She'll make you weep
And moan and cry, to be back in her bosom
To do it again

(Pray) 'Til I go blind
(Pray) 'Cause nobody ever survives
Prayin' to stay in your arms just until I can die a little longer
Saviors and saints, devils and heathens alike
She'll eat you alive

Jesus is risen, it's no surprise
Even he would martyr his mama to ride to hell between those thighs
The pressure is building at the base of my spine
If I gotta sin to see her again then I'm gonna lie, lie, lie

She'll make you cry
I'll sell my soul to be back in your bosom
Gladly now please suck me dry
And still you'll cry, to be back in her bosom
To do it again

(Pray) 'Til I go blind
(Pray) 'Cause nobody ever survives
Prayin' to stay in her arms just until I can die a little longer
Saviors and saints, devils and heathens alike
She'll eat you alive

My pulse has been rising
My temples are pounding
The pressure is so overwhelming and building
So steady there, Freddy
I'm ready to blow
What is she, what is she, what is she waiting for?

(Pray)
(Pray)
(Pray)
(Pray)
(Pray) 'til I go blind
(Pray) 'cause no one ever survives
(Pray) Prayin' to stay in her arms just to die a little longer
Saviors and saints, devils and heathens alike
She'll eat you alive
