Salton Sea
Where my love said she'd rather be with me
Salton, Salton Sea
It's why my heart aches for a memory

She was desperate, I was not right
Hanging on a cord and a flashlight
I got in the car
She drove all night, oh to be
By the Salton Sea

And the rain came down
So we ducked outside that little Arizona town
And it all came clear to me
Why my life, just like the stormy sea
I'm too desperate for the quiet attack
She went upstairs, there was no fight
Just a longing for and a reason, oh to be
Oh to be
Oh to be

Like the Salton Sea
Salton Sea
