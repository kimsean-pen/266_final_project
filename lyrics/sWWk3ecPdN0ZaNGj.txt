If you are the son of Adam
- born at me first man
The I will be Cain to thei Abel
To cast the Tome of sin in your palms
To drink a poison chalice to the table

Oh Luther, did you know you were able
to pierce the tongues of liars?
A gospel of ruin from the heretis age
Straight from the mouth of fire

A lone martyr on the will of perdition
Broken flesh that many raitors confeis
A document in the blood of sedition
Blasphemy led from the pinters press

Oh Luther, did you know you were able
to pierce the tongues of liars?
A gospel of ruin from the heretis age
Straight from the mouth of fire

This papacy of bones stinking high to heaven

O' death, where is they sting?
O' grief, where is the victory?
O' life, you are a shning path
O' Lucifer, did you know did you see?

Pile the dadies high to heaven
To come tumbling to earth again
O' Luther, your wands in deep
