Just say goodbye.
And close the door.
Turn off the light.
And pick up the pieces if you need them.
This world is cold, but just know you're not alone.
No, you're not alone.

I know what you're thinkin'.
Wooooaaaahhh
I know how you're feelin'.
Wooooaaaahhh
Believe me.
Wooooaaaahhh
You're not alone.

I know what you're thinkin'.
Wooooaaaahhh
I know how you're feelin'.
Wooooaaaahhh
Believe me.
Wooooaaaahhh
You're not alone.
Wooooaaaahhh

I've been there before.
Just where you are and not quite so sure that I did the right thing.
Believe me.
And this world is cold so I'll make sure you're not alone.
No you're not alone.

I know what you're thinkin'.
Wooooaaaahhh
I know how you're feelin'.
Wooooaaaahhh
Believe me.
Wooooaaaahhh
You're not alone.

I know what you're thinkin'.
Wooooaaaahhh
I know how you're feelin'.
Wooooaaaahhh
Believe me.
Wooooaaaahhh
You're not alone, no.

Why don't you stay with me tonight.
Because I know everything is not alright.
Why don't you stay with me tonight.
Because I know everything is not alright, and that's not alright.

I know what you're thinkin'.
Wooooaaaahhh
I know how you're feelin'.
Wooooaaaahhh
Believe me.
Wooooaaaahhh
You're not alone.
Wooooaaaahhh

I know what you're thinkin'.
