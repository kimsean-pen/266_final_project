Is there a place I can go?
Is there a light to get me there?
If I've forgotten what to say
It's because all words are dust

If this is really what you think
How come you won't look me in the eye?
All this crying in your sleep
As I lie awake beside

Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

Is there a T-shirt I can wear?
'Cause I am soaking look at me
What do you mean I don't love you?
I am standing here, aren't I?

Maybe you thought of it first
Maybe I get all the praise
Is there a place I can go?
Is there a light to get me there?

Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
