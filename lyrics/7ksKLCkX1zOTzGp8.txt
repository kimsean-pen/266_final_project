You wasted all your chances
To find yourself lost and lonely
Were so foolish, you were so selfish
Much too blind to realize
You messed up your own life

Eu vou contando os dias
E já, já não tenho medo
Eu lhe peço, eu imploro
Quando a minha hora chegar
Meu descanso minha paz

Cante uma canção desconhecida
Poisoning with hope the hearts around you
Plante mais lembranças na sua vida
Death is calling you (Now or never!)
Nada além do amor é o que parece
Please the ones you love before you miss'em
Toda a minha dor na minha prece
Win my chances back
'Cause life is short but it's never late!

It's time to find Redemption
Only love defies the Resurrection
Mark my words: God's abandoned this world!

Would I live again?
What's the new religion? Yeah
And what shall be the bread?
Really I don't give a damn!
Never wanna live again
In this vain emotion
Over for me!

Sing a lullaby, now I remember
Tempo que se foi e não se esquece mais
Oh, memories are twisting in my mind
Win my chances back
'Cause life is short but it's never late

It's time to find Redemption
Only love defies the resurrection
Mark my words: God's abandoned this world!
My destiny is over
And this hope above your comprehension
Is the love you've been dreaming so long
Over for me
