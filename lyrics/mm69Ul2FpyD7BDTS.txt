Here comes the ice cream man
Parked to the end of the road
With a swish of his magic whip
All the people in the party froze
Screwball, chocolate chip
Umbrella in his white glove hand
Shade from the sun was his intention

Here comes the ice cream man
Bouncing up the hill
With a whip of pumpkin lick
Happy that the cones he fills, for
All the Lantern men marching down till dawn
Morning come, he fall over

Something new
Something you
Something you'd

Here comes the ice cream man
Parked to the end of the road
With a swish of his magic whip
All the people in the party froze
I was only 21 when I watched it on TV
I was racing in my heart and then

Something new
(Oh oh-oh oh)
Something new
Something new
(Oh oh-oh oh)
Something new
(Something you do nothing about)
Something new
(Oh oh-oh oh)
Something new
(Here comes the ice cream man, out with his magic whip)
Something new
(Always sold out by nine, so you better come and get it quick)
Something new
(Oh oh-oh oh)
Something new
