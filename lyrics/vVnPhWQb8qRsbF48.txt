Suddenly I found
That I'd lost my way in this city
The streets and the thousands of colors
All bleed into one

I fall down, Heaven won't help me
I call out, no one would hear

All of a sudden
I'd lost my way out of the city

Stand tall, stand proud

Every beginning
Is breaking its promise
I'm having trouble
Just finding my soul in this town

The names on the faces in places
They mean nothing to me
It's all they can do
To be part of the queue in this town

I fall down, Heaven won't help me
I call out, no one will hear

Be no tomorrow they say
Well, I say more's the pity

Stand tall, stand proud

Every beginning
Is breaking its promise
I'm having trouble
Just finding my soul in this town

Stand tall, stand proud

Every beginning
Is breaking its promise
I'm having trouble
Just finding my soul in this town

Finding my soul in this town

Keep on trying
Keep on trying
Keep on trying
...
