She makes me high the way I want to feel in photographs
Oh every picture Im gonna burn,
Where every smile was a lesson learned

I wanna say,
Breakdown, all on me
Im gonna figure this out but I dont know how
Breakdown, all on me
Im only running til I get out

Youll be the reason Ill be uneven
Youve got me on the edge to jump for you
Youll be my fire, call me a liar
Well make mistakes the way we always do
We always do

And now Im starting ever sentence with an apology
Oh whats your reason for leaving now?
Is it too late to follow you out?

I wanna say,
Breakdown, all on me
Im gonna figure this out but I dont know how
Breakdown, all on me
I dont wanna be selfish
But would it kill you to be a little more precise
and more polite when you speak

Youll be the reason Ill be uneven
Youve got me on the edge to jump for you
Youll be my fire, call me a liar
Well make mistakes the way we always do

When we both need each other, these moments are priceless
And Im starting to gather up my confidence, just for you

Youll be the reason Ill be uneven
Covered in glass and lying on the floor
Youll be the brightest, star in the sky
Sing me a song and tell me who its for

Youll be the reason Ill be uneven
Youve got me on the edge to jump for you
Youll be the brightest, star in the sky
Well make mistakes the way we always do
