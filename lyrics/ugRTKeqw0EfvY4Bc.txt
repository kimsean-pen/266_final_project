The awakening of the gods
the rising of the souls
here I lie tied to my bed
awaiting the coming of ghouls

I close my eyes as if to die
entering again
the labyrinths of deep within
beyond where conscious ends

Hellish terrors risen
in the mountains of unknown
below the skies of I
sleeps a ruler in his throne

Beneath the collonades of fear
deep below his halls
in the endless realms of I
inside the entombed vaults

The insane watching eye
staring through my bones
shreds the soul out of my skin
and leaves me naked and alone

(Leads: Cederlund, Hellid)

Although my dreams have ended
as I wished in weakened thought
beyond me night is total
and through the collonades I walk
