On your eyelids
Orbits lighted
Stories in the lines across your face

Thought and reason
Reappearing
Holding out your hands against the race

And I didn't think I would stay for this
And you didn't think I would go
But now we're alone in the atmosphere
A place I'll never know
And nothing goes unspoken
When the colors unfold
Cuz now we're alone in the atmosphere
Oh

And I realized
This is paradise
Almost paradise
Here in paradise
And my heart was taken by the surprise
This is paradise
This is paradise

And now we're alone in the atmosphere and I'm fading
Here we are
Here we are
And now we're alone in the atmosphere and I'm fading
Here we are
Here we are

Towards the evening
Shadows kneeling
Down for all the triumph that we've made

So paint your solace
And hold what's honest
Glory doesn't come for those who wait

And I didn't think I would stay for this
And you didn't think I would go
but now we're alone in the atmosphere
A place I'll never know
And nothing goes unspoken
When the colors unfold
Cuz now we're alone in the atmosphere
Oh

And I realized
This is paradise
Almost paradise
Here in paradise
And my heart was taken by the surprise
This is paradise
This is paradise

And now we're alone in the atmosphere and I'm fading
Here we are
Here we are
And now we're alone in the atmosphere and I'm fading
Here we are
Here we are
