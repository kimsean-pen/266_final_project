A foolish bait
A foolish bait
Did I, did I, did I
Did I do a foolish bait
My sugar veins
My sugar veins
Did I, did I, did I
Did I do my sugar veins

The foolish bait
The foolish bait
Did I, did I, did I
Did I do a foolish bait
My sugar veins
My sugar veins
My, my, my, my
My sugar veins

Right honor, coat of armor
And I'm proud
Let my left die, dreams are led like
And I'm down
Still a lover but no further
Then a board game
Still a lover but for sugar
In my vein

So let us join up and be springful
Your prevision is more than a mouthful
So let us join up and be peaceful
Your prevision is more than unfaithful

Right honor, coat of armor
And I'm proud
Let my left die, dreams are led like
And I'm down
Still a lover but no further
Then a board game
Still a lover but for sugar
In my vein

So let us join up and be thankful
Your prevision is more than a handful
Houdini never knew how he did it
Broke the tomb and he hammered the death bed

And he hammered the death bed
