It seems as though
All is behind glass
Afraid to move
In case it breaks

Moving further away
From harmony
Modern chaos rules
A deception of security
Crafted by false bonds
False bonds, Despond
Severance
Our haven destroyed
By the cruelty of reality

On the edge
Crossed the line
Fissure, we've split
A world long lost

Fractured
Dissension
Fragments
Disjunction
