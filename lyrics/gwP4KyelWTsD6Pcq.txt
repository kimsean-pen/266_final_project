You're a liar
You wear a gun, makes you look bigger
You scare the crowd, don't you feel smarter
Like a little kid, you play with fire
You do your part, you do it all

But those words from your mouth, they are scary
And the hate that you have, that you carry
It will grow and will grow 'til we're buried

You're so clever
If this is war, it's like no other
If there is blame, it's on each other
I hear the cries, they last forever
We did our part, we came along

But those words from your mouth, they are scary
And the hate that you have, that you carry
It will grow and will grow 'til we're buried
And there will be nothing left except sadness
And a scar without words, without anything
Cause we've done this before
This is madness

I am sorry

But those words from your mouth, they are scary
And the hate that you have, that you carry
It will grow and will grow, 'til we're buried
And there will be nothing left, except sadness
And a scar without words, without anything
Cause we've done this before, this is madness

This is wrong, this is us, this is happening
But we've done this before, but we're standing

We're still standing
And we've done this before, but we're standing
