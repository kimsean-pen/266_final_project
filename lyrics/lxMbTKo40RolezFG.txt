You make my world, you make my world go round
You turn me up, you turn me upside down
You make my world, you make my world go round
You get me off, you get me off the ground
You pick me up when I fall down
You pick me up when I fall down
Girl, youre like an elevator cause you always pick me up
Girl, youre like a doctor when Im sick you always stitch me up
You could be my DJ, I'm your record, come and mix me up
You can be my lollipop, lemme, lemme lick you up
On the bottom, on the top, baby, lemme flip you up
You can be my soda pop, Coca Cola sip it up
Whip cream, whip it up, strip on, zip it up
I could be your chip, you can be my dip, lemme dip it up
You make my world, you make my world go round
You turn me up, you turn me upside down
You make my world, you make my world go round
You get me off, you get me off the ground
You pick me up when I fall down
You pick me up when I fall down
You pick me up when I fall down
You pick me up when I fall down
Boy, youre like an elevator cause you always pick me up
Boy, youre like my doctor, when Im sick, you always stitch me up
You could be my DJ, I'm your record, come and mix me up
Boy, just be my lollipop, lemme, lemme lick you up
Always on my membrane, I love you so I give it up
Lets visit all the places thats exquisite lets go live it up
Walking down lovers lane, flying in an airplane
Boy you get me higher, like your nickname was Mary Jane
You make my world, you make my world go round
You turn me up, you turn me upside down
You make my world, you make my world go round
You get me off, you get me off the ground
You pick me up when I fall down
You pick me up when I fall down
You pick me up when I fall down
You pick me up when I fall down
Fall down
You pick me up when I fall down
You pick me up when I fall down
When Im down
You pick me off the ground
When Im down, down, down...
