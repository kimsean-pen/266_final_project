I wonder why
You went away
You took the spring with you when you said you had packed your bags
And will not stay
Anymore

A common lie
One that would safe two souls from strife
Two souls in the hard light
Your eyes gave away the old shelter that the night has inscribed
Your heart's high priced

And when I take the time to mourn and I do
I see women with their faces wrapped in shades like you
Like you

So I wonder why
You went away
And hauled off the features of the land that you unveiled
To my young eyes
These sorry eyes
All night when the tide rolls in
And I think of you
And my heart falls like the prey
I cannot say
I cannot lie
Oh these feeding fangs won't let go of me
And your eyes are sighs

And when I take the time to mourn and you know that I do
I see women with their faces wrapped in shades like you
Just like the way you do
Your hands still on the pillows and the lanes
The covers and the sheets
They memorized your wills
Oh god knows they look just like you
Just like you do
