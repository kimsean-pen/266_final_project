It's late at night and the world's asleep, I'm trying not to think.
I take some pills cuz my mind bleeds, I'm thinking what is wrong with me?
Because the only thing I know about honesty is every lie I've told that you believed.
I'm afraid to be alone. I'm afraid that one day you'll find out.

And you'll be amazed at the secrets I keep.
You'd be amazed at my mouth full of lies.
But I'm too afraid to come clean
cuz my life's the flame in a house of cards.

Now I can't look you in your eyes because the guilt is killing me.
I try to disconnect my heart again just so I can breathe,
I want to be myself again but I just can't cuz
I'm afraid to be alone. I'm afraid that one day you'll find out.

And you'll be amazed at the secrets I keep.
You'd be amazed at my mouth full of lies.
But I'm too afraid to come clean
cuz my life's the flame in a house of cards.

It's such a shame what I've become after years of breaking down,
my whole life has come undone cuz I'm trying to fake it all.
I know that you love someone, but that someone isn't me,
or is this me?

[There is some kind of whispering, but it was too quiet]

And you'll be amazed at the secrets I keep.
You'd be amazed at my mouth full of lies.
But I'm too afraid to come clean
cuz my life's the flame in a house of cards.
