Make me a deal
And make it good for me
I won't get full of myself
'Cause I cant afford to be
This is small town music
This is big town music
He's ahead of his time, you know
But he can't use it
If only he could prove it

Well, tomorrow's just a song away, a song away, a song away
Oh, and tomorrow's just a song away, a song away, a song away
It's just a song away

Hey!

See what your man has done to the world
See what the world has done to your man
You know I'm leaving you
You don't need me
Lovin' you wasn't
Always so easy

This is believe me music
This is forget me music
This is who can love me, you know
This ain't no Roxy music
This is new form music
This is old form music
This is I paid attention, now
So, this is prediction music
Oh, who could let me use it

Oh, tomorrow's just a song away, a song away, a song away
Oh, and tomorrow's just a song away, a song away, a song away
It's just a song away

Yeah! Woo! Huh! Uh! Hey!
Well, and I want to write a truthful song
Over an eighties groove
I like to let you know
I'll always be straight with you
I stole my personality
From an anonymous source
And I'm gonna pay for it, too
I don't feel bad about that
Give me my chance back

Well, this is on the rise music
This is novelty music
This is who can blame music
I don't get fooled by it
This is where'd you go music
This is come home music
This is down to the wire
I'm such a perfect angel music
Who really tries

Oh, and tomorrow's just a song away, a song away, a song away
Oh, and tomorrow's just a song away, a song away, a song away

Aw, well, this is success music
And what's it to ya?
My lawyer always says
These are the facts about the future

Well, tomorrow's just a song away, a song away, a song away
Oh, well, tomorrow's just a song away, a song away, a song away

Oh, well, tomorrow's just a song away, a song away, a song away
It's just a song away
