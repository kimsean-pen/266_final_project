Sometimes the words don't really matter
I hope you drown in my wild sea
Sometimes I feel we're in the gutter
So lock the door
Swallow the key
Sometimes the words are all that matters
i hope you drown in my deep sea
Sometimes I know we're in the gutter
So lock your heart
Give me the key
i'm terrified
Can you just hold me
I dedicate myself to you
I cry out loud
Don't you ignore me
My lipstick melts
I die for you
It won't be long until they get us
The shadowmen
In their black suits
We almost feel their fingers grab us
They offer us the strangest fruits
It won't last long until they get us
I hear them crawl inside our bed
We almost feel their breath behind us
Are they for real or just in our head
i'm terrified
Can you just hold me
I dedicate myself to you
I cry out loud
Don't you ignore me
My lipstick melts
I die for you
