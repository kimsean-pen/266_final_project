Bound into a stasis
Looking for a way out
I can see through your eyes
Cities' walls, fears I'll ever know

But two is not enough
But two is not enough
But two is not enough
But two is not enough

Want to live and wanna die
Rest of us are wasting time
Caught in the middle of our fate
Caught in the middle of our fate

But two is not enough
But two is not enough
But two is not enough
But two is not enough
