I think it's time for me to go now
I've done more harm than good
If I could change how this turned out
Yeah, you know that I would

Sometimes the weight is more than I can hold
I'd rather fail than not know

If it takes forever
I will die trying
If it takes forever
I will die trying
I will die trying

I wish I knew then what I know now
But I'd probably do the same
Yeah, I get the feeling it's planned out
From the cradle to the grave

Sometimes the weight is more than I can hold
I'd rather fail than never really know

If it takes forever
I will die trying
If it takes forever
I will die trying
I will die trying

I am digging a hole
I am taking it all
I am digging a hole to bury my soul
I am digging
If it takes forever
I will die trying

If it takes forever
I will die trying
If it takes forever
I will die trying
If it takes forever (forever)
I will die trying (I will die trying)
If it takes forever (forever)
I will die trying (forever)
I will die trying, trying
