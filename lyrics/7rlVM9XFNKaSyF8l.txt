Don't make me sad
Tell me it's fine
Don't make me lonely
Tell me I'm your only one

Let's get physical
All alone in midnight
In the blazing lights I can see myself
A lot like you

My eyes in blue

Hey, you are the one
It must be fun
Tell me I'm lonely

Tell me I'm your only one

Turning me internallaaaa
They find out sans in aaaaai
Tell me it's fine
Tell me I'm just having fun

Let's get physical
All alone in midnight
In the blazing lights I can see myself
A lot like you

My eyes in blue

Oh, I love you, baby
