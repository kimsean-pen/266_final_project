We first met at the airport
Well if you think that's a sign
I gotta tell you that you're wrong
'Cause it went all downhill from there
To the here and now

Her flight got canceled
So was mine
At least that's what I told her
Have you ever been to Rome
Just for a night

I said I'd rob a fucking bank with you
We pay for the tickets and burn the rest
It's you and me against them all
For now

I said I'd rob a fucking bank with you
We pay for the tickets and burn the rest
It's you and me against them all
For now

We trashed the hotel room
She wrote "kill 'em all"
With lipstick on the window
And it went all downhill from there
To the here and now

We both passed out on her floor
When I woke up she's gone
I paid for the hotel room
She's always been two steps ahead
But I didn't mind

She said I'd rob fucking bank with you
We pay for the tickets and burn the rest
It's you and me against them all
For now

She said I'd rob fucking bank with you
We pay for the tickets and burn the rest
It's you and me against them all
For now

Ahh
You gotta do what you gotta do
Do it do it
Do it do it

You gotta do what you gotta do
Do it do it
Come on and do it

We fighting always a yes
We fighting always a yes
I won't protest
Won't protest

You gotta do what you gotta do
Do it do it
Do it do it
Do it do it

I'd rob a fucking bank with you
We pay for the tickets and burn the rest
You and me against them all
For now

I said I'd rob a fucking bank with you
We pay for the tickets and burn the rest
It's you and me against them all
For now

You gotta do what you gotta do
Do it do it
Do it do it

You gotta do what you gotta do
Do it do it
Come on and do it
