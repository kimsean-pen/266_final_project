Ah, Ah, Ah

Thinking about the way she looked, the way she leapt right out of bed
I can't seem to stop that day from replaying inside my head
Ah, ah, ah

Cause this house ain't no home,
yeah this house ain't no home, yeah this house ain't no home
Without she, lying next to me
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

She walks with such grace, she'll never be replaced

Cause this house ain't no home,
yeah this house ain't no home, yeah this house ain't no home
Without she, lying next to me.
