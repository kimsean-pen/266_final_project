I always wanted to see the colors of your destiny
I always wanted to know a flower that would grow
Serious, serious

I'm a trophy on your arm
You wear me like a charm, yes you do
An accessory that suits
Your new suede boots

I get a feeling deep down inside
Something just ain't right
I get a feeling that tells me I know
Baby you never show

How you really feel for me
Tell me, can we ever be
Serious, serious in love?

A joke on my expense
In front of all your friends, all the time
A game you like to play
Leaves me solo every day

I get a feeling deep down inside
Something just ain't right
I get a feeling that tells me I know
Baby you never show

How you really feel for me
Tell me can we ever be
Serious, serious in love
Serious, serious in love?

I get a feeling deep down inside
That something just ain't right
I get a feeling that tells me I know
Baby you never show

How you really feel for me
Tell me, can we ever be, tell me
Serious, serious in love?

Serious, serious
Serious, serious
Serious, serious
