When all my druggy friends go missing in San Francisco
You think I don't understand anything anymore
I miss how we used to speak secret loser language
You blocked my number just because I stayed alive

If you're going to break yourself
If you're going to break yourself
You're gonna break me
You're gonna break me
If you're going to break yourself
If you're going to break yourself
You're gonna break me
You're gonna break me

Our tongues and our spit, blue from blue candy
Kissed with numb lips and wondered what was awkward
This landscape is a paradise swing and close your eyes and
You're an asshole you know but I miss you

If you're going to break yourself
If you're going to break yourself
You're gonna break me
You're gonna break me
If you're going to break yourself
If you're going to break yourself
You're gonna break me
You're gonna break me

Gonna break, gonna break me
Break yourself, yourself
Gonna break me
Gonna break, gonna break me

If you're going to break yourself
If you're going to break yourself
You're gonna break me
You're gonna break me
If you're going to break yourself
If you're going to break yourself
You're gonna break me
You're gonna break me
