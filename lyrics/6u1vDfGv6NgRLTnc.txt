Cause I'd like to save you
Make me talk to you
'Cause I'd like to save you

The days of bitter are coming to an end
So come with me, if you want to leave
You can find time where they're not for sale
I need the same too
There's nowhere left to go, so I'd like to save you
My hand's been bloody since the day I came
It's such a shame, you've seen my violent side

Don't make me go the wrong way
'Cause I'd like to save you
