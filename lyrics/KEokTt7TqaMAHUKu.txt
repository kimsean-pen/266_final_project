Make way for the passenger
Eyes wide open like a scavenger
Gloom or get fixed up
Have no ears for the leveller

This ride gets fueled up
Joining the tribe of the sucked up

Make way for the passenger
Make way for the passenger

Some say I'm a prisoner
A clear case of a bad listener
But I ride when I'll ride
On a one way street into the night

These eyes don't look ahead
These drops of sweat won't reach a bed

Make way for the passenger
Make way for the passenger

Live fast, die young
That's what they say when they sell this gun
Heartbeats like war drums
I'm grinding teeth with the lonesome

This ride will ride on
This live will die on

Make way for the passenger
Make way for the passanger
Make way for the passenger
Make way make way
