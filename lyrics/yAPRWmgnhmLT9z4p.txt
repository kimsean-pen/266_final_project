In a city like mine, there's no point in fighting
I close my eyes, I see you and me driving
If I am a river, you are the ocean
Got the radio on, got the wheels in motion

We were silenced by the night
But you and I, we gonna rise again
Divided from the light
I wanna love the way we used to then

I lie in the dark, I feel I'm falling
Feel your hand on my back, hear your voice calling
I'm out of my depth girl, stick close to me
Because the people in this town, they look straight through me

We were silenced by the night
But you and I, we gonna rise again
Divided from the light
I wanna love the way we used to then

'Cause baby I'm not scared
Of this world
When you're here
No baby I'm not scared
Of this world
When you're here

You and I, we gonna rise again
You and I, we gonna rise again

We were silenced by the night
But you and I, we're gonna rise again
Divided from the light
I wanna love the way we used to then
