You saw my sun down
She makes me run wild
Where's the fun now?
Where's the fun now?

And I full run down
She breaks the love town
I feel the real now
She says I'm too proud

Keep you in the back of my mind
You're always in my sight
Keep you in the back
Keep you in the back of my mind
You're always in my sun

Where you found out
is when you talk loud
Don't want to put you down
if you remind now
Can see you fade out
Why want you stay now
shadow cost down
You didn't heave on the ground

Keep you in the back of my mind
You're always in my sight
Keep you in the back
Keep you in the back of my mind
You're always in my sun

You saw my sun down
She makes me run wild
Where's the fun now?
Where's the fun now?

And I full run down
She breaks the love town
I feel the real now
She says I'm too proud

Keep you in the back of my mind
You're always in my sight
Keep you in the back
Keep you in the back of my mind
You're always in my sun
