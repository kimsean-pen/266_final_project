Every day I write the list
Of reasons why I still believe they do exist (a thousand beautiful things)
And even though it's hard to see
The glass as full and not half empty (a thousand beautiful things)

So, light me up like the sun
To cool down with your rain
I never want to close my eyes again
Never close my eyes
Never close... my eyes

I thank you for the air to breathe
The heart to beat
The eyes to see again (a thousand beautiful things)
And all the things that's been and done
The battles won
The good and bad in everyone (this is mine to remember)
So, here I go again (here I go...)
Singin' by your window (singin')
Pickin' up the pieces of what's left to find...
(pickin' up, pickin' up...) (to find, to find, to find...)

The world was meant for you and me
To figure out our destiny (All the world is meant for you and me)
(Ooh, remember)

To live (live), to die (die)
To breathe (breathe), to sleep (sleep)
To try to make your life complete... yeah, yeah

So, light me up like the sun (come on light me up just like a sun)
To cool down with your rain (cool me down with your rain)
I never want to close my eyes again
Never close my eyes (never gonna close my eyes...)
Never close... my eyes

(And that is everything I have to say)
(That is everything I have to say)
That's all I have to say
(That is everything I have to say)
(That is everything I have to say)
That's all I have to say
