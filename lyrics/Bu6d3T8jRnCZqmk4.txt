I know what you're trying to do
Know what you're trying to say
You giving me the eye then pushing me away
It's like you're playing games
Like you're the only one
We're both one and the same
So think about it

All you're friends are telling me
There's only one ambition on your mind
You keep on denying it
But all the proof I need is in your eyes

You can say what you want
Play it cool if you like
But your identified
You play my heart 'cause you're smart
Put up a front
But I see what's inside
Got you're identified
You play my heart 'cause you're smart

You keep asking how I am and
Watching what I do
You're waiting for the chance
C'mon and tell the truth
It's more than obvious the way you cover up
So tell me why the fuss
Just c'mon over

All you're friends are telling me
There's only one ambition on your mind
You keep on denying it
But all the proof I need is in your eyes

You can say what you want
Play it cool if you like
But your identified
You play my heart 'cause you're smart
Put up a front
But I see what's inside
Got you're identified
You play my heart 'cause you're smart

You can say what you want
Play it cool if you like
But your identified
You play my heart 'cause you're smart
Put up a front
But I see what's inside
Got you're identified
You play my heart 'cause you're smart

I got a confession
I can see through what you're doing
Had it right from the beginning
Got your identified
C'mon over to me
Tell me now before you lose me
It's no secret you pursue me
Got your identified

You can say what you want
Play it cool if you like
But your identified
You play my heart 'cause you're smart
Put up a front
But I see what's inside
Got you're identified
You play my heart 'cause you're smart

You can say what you want
Play it cool if you like
But your identified
You play my heart 'cause you're smart
Put up a front
But I see what's inside
Got you're identified
You play my heart 'cause you're smart
