No sympathy really here
All the sweetness is left somewhere
On some street miles from where we seem to be
No love, no love

No compassion really here
Even the reason why we met
Has vanished in the air
You keep talking as I sit and glare
Just cant understand how it disappeared no

No love in this room
No love left in here
No love in my soul left for you

No love left in here
No love in this room
No love in my soul left for you

So I sit and wait till it appears
Hopefully someday soon
Hopefully before next year
I just sit and I glare
It's a mystery how it vanished
How it left me here

Oh my heart so bare
Nothing left to share
Oh where did it go
Withered away
Give me love that will stay

No love in this room
No love left in here
No love in my soul left for you

No love left in here
No love in this room
No love in my soul left for you

No love left in here
No love in this room
No love in my soul left for you

No love in this room
No love left in here
No love in my soul left for you
