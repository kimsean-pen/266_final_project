I am walking through your streets
I am looking in your windows
I am elemental now
You'll never even know I'm there
I am watching over you
I am living in the shadows
I am just a word to you
But I am very real and cold
Cold to all of this
Cold to how you feel
Cold to all your lucid reason

I am everything
I am anything
I am automatic
I am yesterday
I am everyday
I am gonna be

I am all there is to know
I am all that you've forgotten
I am enigmatic now
You never even knew my name
I am dressed in tragedy
I am by design immortal
I am just the last one left
But I am always here and old
Old and very strong
Old as all you feel
Old as all the world around you

I am everything
I am anything
I am automatic
I am yesterday
I am everyday
I am gonna be

Reborn (this is the start of something)
Reborn (this is the start of something)
Reborn (this is the start of something)
Reborn (this is the start of something)

I am just a secret now
I am just a vague illusion
I am lie you tell yourself that you never truly did believe
I am a whisper in the dark
I am a victim and the killer
I am almost ready now
But you insist I don't exist
That I don't exist
That I don't exist
That I don't exist

I am everything
I am anything
I am automatic
I am yesterday
I am everyday
I am gonna be

Reborn (this is the start of something)
Reborn (this is the start of something)
Reborn (this is the start of something)
Reborn (this is the start of something)

(Motherfucker, motherfucker, motherfucker!)
