Top Jimmy, loss of control, light up the sky, best of both worlds
Spanish flag, dancing in the street, love walks in, drop dead legs
Source of infection, fifty one fifty, beautiful girls, ice cream man
Dancing the night away,
finish what you started, where have all the good times gone
You really got me, the full bug, feels so good, summer nights

I was born to party, you were born to bring it down

Running with the devil through pain now
Crash on my bed, sixteen
That was the summer

Are you talking about love, happy trails, bottoms up

Why can't this be love, for unlawful carnal knowledge
When it's love, Van Halen 1, Van Halen 2

I was born to party, you were born to bring it down

Running with the devil through pain now
Crash on my bed
That was the summer, be free
You and me
You and me
