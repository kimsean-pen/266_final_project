The changing
Of sunlight
To moonlight
Reflections of my life
Oh, how they fill my eyes

The greetings
Of people
In trouble
Reflections of my life

Oh, how they fill my eyes

All my sorrow
Sad tomorrow
Take me back
To my old home

All my crying (all my crying)
Feel I'm dying, dying
Take me back
To my old home

I'm changing

Arranging
I'm changing
I'm changing everything
Ah, everything around me
The world is
A bad place
A bad place,
A terrible place to live
Oh, but I don't wanna die

All my sorrow
Sad tomorrow
Take me back
To my old home
All my crying (all my crying)
Feel I'm dying, dying
Take me back
To my old home
