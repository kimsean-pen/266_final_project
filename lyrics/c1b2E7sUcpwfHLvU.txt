Come out tonight are you ready to live
Don't give it up, you've got much more to give
The city is dead but the night is alive
I still believe in this, don't let it die

I will never forget, the weight of the world
When we were together, I long to return
I will never forget, how you made me feel
Come make me relive the wonders of that time
Back when you were mine

Late by the beach caught the last of the sun
Young hearts together, our lives had begun
Wrote down a promise and threw it to sea
Know that your secret is safe here with me

You were always building me up
Are you ready, build it back up

In the distance, it's calling
It's closing in on you
What you're after, what you wanted
Every time was something new
Rest easy, I know all that we left behind
Is out there, still waiting
Somewhere back in time
