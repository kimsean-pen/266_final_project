Are you hurting the one you love?
You say you've found Heaven, but you can't find God
Are you hurting the one you love?
Bite your tongue 'til it tastes like blood
Are you hurting the one you love?
So many glasses on the tabletop
Are you hurting the one you love?
You'd like to stay in heaven, but the rules are too tough
Tough
It's just too tough
Tough
It's just too tough
Are you hurting the one you love?
When they watched the walls & the ticking clock
Are you hurting the one you love?
& was it something you could not stop
Could not stop
Stop
Could not stop
Stop
Could not stop
Stop
Could not stop
Stop
Could not stop
Are you hurting the one you love?
Leave them sleeping in the middle of the floor
Are you hurting the one you love?
& lost for themselves
Are you hurting the one you love?
& if heaven knows, then who will stop?
Are you hurting the one you love?
You said you got to heaven, but it wasn't enough
