Something's been going on
and I don't know what it is
You don't mind the taking girl,
but you don't know how to give
You drove me crazy, but I don't know, baby
You're thinking that it's me you're fooling?
Where's the right in all of our fighting?
Look at what you're doing

Where's the love?
It's not enough
It makes the world go 'round and 'round and
Where's the love?
Give it up
It makes the world go 'round and 'round and 'round

Can you tell me what you see whenever you look around?
We're tripping all over ourselves and pulling each other down
We're separating, consciousness is fading
You thinking that it's me you're fooling?
Where's the right in all of our fighting?
Look at, look at, look at what we're doing

Where's the love?
It's not enough
It makes the world go 'round and 'round and
Where's the love?
Give it up
It makes the world go 'round and 'round and 'round

Dark clouds all around
Lightning, rain pouring down
We're waiting for the bright light to break through
Face down on the ground
Pick us up at the lost and found
We've got to change our point of view if we want the sky blue

We're segregating, consciences are fading
You're thinking that it's me you're fooling?
Where's the right in all of our fighting?
Look at what we're doing

Where's the love?
It's not enough
It makes the world go 'round and around and around and around
Where's the love?
Just give it up
It makes the world go 'round and 'round and 'round

Where's the love? It's not enough
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Give it up, just give it up
Give it up, give it up
'Round and 'round and 'round

Where's the love? It's not enough
Not enough, not enough
'Round and around and around and around
Where's the love? Just give it up
Won't you, won't you give it up?
