Sway your hips from side to side
Your golden legs they hipnotize
I am driven mad with lust
And I know your mouth ain't one to trust
But I can't help but want to feel
Your teeth against my skin
If you got fangs then sink'em in

There you stand, all dressed in black
With you hood pulled up
Ready for attack
As pale as a winter moon
And I'm locked into your heart shaped tomb

They way you move is so divine
It's sending shivers through my spine
And I am locked into your gaze
And you are locked in mine

But I can't help but want to feel
Your teeth against my skin
If you got fangs them sink'em in

And while the cobras dance
Around your feet like you're a god
It only takes one bite for you to realise you are not

And while the cobras dance
Around your feet like you're a god
It only takes one bite for you to realise you are not

But I can't help but want to feel
Your teeth against my skin
If you got fangs them sink'em in

But I can't help but want to feel
Your teeth against my skin
If you got fangs them sink'em in
