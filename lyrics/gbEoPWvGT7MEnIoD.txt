My memories like
Deleted film
Awareness of this fire
Kerosene
Ignite the trial of my mind
Above the horizon now
Upon the freezing tracks
Grasp for the embers of my life
You came back but so did I.

Who's in control
Spite
So cold in this light.

Reflective summary
Froze me in a frame
My time had run out before the future came
Depart from insight
Breach was made.

How could I ever forget our days
I drown in silver
Set to go
Unafraid
Into the blue, blue waves
Though I had hoped to hear your voice there
Last song before the fade.

Who's in control
Spite
So cold in this light.

Arise to other heights now
Make me transcend in to your still heart
Beyond this world of stone
Let me surrender to the streams of nought.

Last song before the fade.

Sick days behind me now
Winter wails through the chest
Dim the lights as I pass
Will be no harm.

Arise to other heights now
Make me transcend in to your still heart
Beyond this world of stone
Let me surrender to the streams of nought.

Last song before the fade.
