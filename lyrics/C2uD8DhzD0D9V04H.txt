Summer everybody's coming home
And I'm lying in my old bedroom again on my own
Listen to the car's passing outside
Member Adam crashed his car into the tree
But somehow he survived
Then the next night you walked me home
We'd been drinkin' underage and
you said do you think our parents know
We hid a bottle in the trees
Oh, we couldn't find it later
Guess the neighbour's getting drunk for free
No, we couldn't find it later
Guess the neighbour's getting drunk on me
Some days are quiet in my mind
It's not that l don't miss you
I have just lived this distance for some time
I still think about that September night
Sitting on an empty pier
Nobody will find us here
We were dreaming about where we both would go
You pointed out across the ocean
Oh, l wonder now if I had known
When we hid that bottle in the trees
That we wouldn't find it later
Guess the neighbour's getting drunk for free
No, we wouldn't find it later
Guess the neighbour's getting drunk on me
You waved at me from the front door
I told you I'd be home for Christmas
I've been gone for 6 years more
You know I meant to call you back
It gets so busy in this city
You expect me to keep track
It's raining in New York too
That doesn't mean I'm any closer to you
If I can't be your friend
I don't need you to believe me, oh
But can't we still pretend
If I can't be your friend
I don't need you to forgive me, oh
But can't we still pretend
If I can't be your friend
I don't need you to believe me, oh
But can't we still pretend
If I can't be your friend
I don't need you to forgive me
I don't need you to forgive me...
