Your integrity
And your dignity
Don't give it away
If someone will pay

Own your honor
Everything's for sale

Your defeat
And victory for the other team
When you throw the game

Maps and directions
The promise of protection
Guns and religion

Eroding seaside lots in hurricane states
Admission to the Ivy League
And very white teeth

Commemorative coins and privacy
Government positions and pretty babies

No exceptions
Everything's on sale

Trophy wives and dog meat
And fake IDs

Hugs and kisses
And highly sensitive information

Executive producer credit and ivory
Freedom and organs and multiple spins
Narcan, spray paint, bath salts, meth
Opioids, steroids and weed

Bulletproof phone booths
And flower delivery and altered DNA

Self-cleaning ovens
Conversion therapy
Rabbit ears and feet

Lip injections and airstreams
Original ideas and stolen jewelry

Pesticides and a private jet for
The preacher praying for it on TV

Scheduled C-sections
And bottle service
And loyalty

Future trips to outer space
And better ratings, edible pants
And a wall full of leaves
