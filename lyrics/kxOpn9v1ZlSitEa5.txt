Someone's always breaking down
Packing their clothes
Leaving for good
Coming back home
Either we're like strangers
Or the Best of friends
Taking all night
Or Never speaking again
Chorus
Giving it up
Letting it go
Holding back
Risking it all
Falling in love
Falling apart
There's never a dull moment
Here in my heart
Sometimes I think we're crazy
To be Doing this at all
Going round in circles running into walls
maybe we're just used to Living[loving?] on the edge
we got this far[fire] but we are not there yet[are nothing yet]
Chorus(x3)
