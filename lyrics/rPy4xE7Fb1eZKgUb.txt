Now just so we're clear
The one you waited for is right here
I hope you're ready for it my dear
Don't speak the truth too loudly, might hear
'Cause you get one shot, I hope your aim is steady
'Cause you've got the whole world watching ready
Or not, your heartbeat heavy handed
Won't stop

So tell me how bad, tell me, tell me how bad do you?

Wanted, 'cause you're wanted
Are you willing to fight, willing to die
For it? 'Cause you're wanted
Ready to leave it all on the line
For it? 'Cause you're wanted
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From it, 'cause you're wanted
You're wanted

How bad do you want it?
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you want it?
You want it
You can play the game or you can watch them slander
Your name, the truth, it doesn't matter
The flame is being fuelled by chatter but don't change
When you're on the run no turning back
The damage is done, you're nothing but a savage
Someone, no going back to where you came from

So tell me how bad, tell me, tell me how bad do you?

Wanted, 'cause you're wanted
Are you willing to fight, willing to die
For it? 'Cause you're wanted
Ready to leave it on the line
For it? 'Cause you're wanted
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From it, 'cause you're wanted
You're wanted

How bad do you want it?
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you want it?
You want it

Plaster my pictures so the world will not forget my face
I guess being infamous is not the same as fame
Assign me words you know my reputation can't escape
You point your finger long enough, you'll find someone to blame
(Wanted, you're wanted) My character in flames
(Wanted, you're wanted) But I will not be ashamed
(Wanted, you're wanted) Just don't forget my name
I did it once, and I'd do it all again

Wanted, 'cause you're wanted
Are you willing to fight, willing to die
For it? 'Cause you're wanted
Ready to leave it on the line
For it? 'Cause you're wanted
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From it, 'cause you're wanted
You're wanted

How bad do you want it
How bad do you want it
How bad do you want it
You want it
