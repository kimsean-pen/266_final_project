Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
You got no nerve baby, to turn Uncle John from your door

I woke up this morning, I had them Statesboro Blues
I woke up this morning, I had them Statesboro Blues
Well I looked over in the corner, baby
And Grandpa seemed to have them too

Well my momma died and left me
My poppa died and left me
I ain't good looking baby
But I'm somewhat sweet and kind

I'm goin' to the country
Baby do you want to go?
But if you can't make it baby
Your sister Lucille said she'll want to go
And I sure will take her

I love that woman
Better than any woman I've ever seen
Well I love that woman
Better than any woman I've ever seen
Well now she treat me like a king, yeah, yeah, yeah
And she look like a doggone queen

Oh wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
You got no nerve baby, to turn Uncle John from your door
