Sitting down I watch you fall away
Sun in part I watched you for the day
You know I don't believe in death
For the sun, I watched you for the sun
Sitting here I watched you dance
Looking for the sun, I watched you dance

So long, so long
It's just a way to love you
So long, so long
It's just a way to love you

I saw you looking at the sun
I saw you looking at the sun

So long, so long
It's just a way to love you
So long, so long
It's just a way to love you
