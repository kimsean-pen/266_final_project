Everyday convince myself of everything I can and can't believe
Abused confused
Everyday you feel every crime just stare up at space and wonder why
Afraid deranged
Hold to your promise you can use it for a crutch
Stand by while all you dreams get trampled in the dust
Leave now before you slick machines begin to rust
Last chance farewell among us
Everyday you get a little bit older and everything gets hard
you wonder why
Afraid deranged
Everyday you feel every crime and endless shocking show on the parade
Abused confused
Hold on to your promise you can use it for a crutch
Stand by while all you dreams get trampled in the dust
Leave now before you slick machines begin to rust
Last chance farewell among us
Everyday convince myself of everything I can and can't believe
Afraid deranged
Hold on to your promise you can use it for a crutch
Stand by while all you dreams get trampled in the dust
Leave now before you slick machines begin to rust
Last chance farewell
among us
among us
We're the Aliens
We're the Aliens
we're the aliens
