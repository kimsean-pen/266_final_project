Babe, you know I love you, but it's hard to find time to spend together. You've got your career. I've got, my... uh I do stuff. But I'll find a way to work this out. Let's GET IT ON!

I'm a busy guy, and you're a busy woman
Every day you wake up for work at the crack of nine
Then we gotta choose between morning sex and breakfast
God knows we need both but there just ain't no time

But I've found a way to get the most out of our day
I prepared you this buffet
So grab a tray, take off your clothes
And follow me

Let's eat our food in the shower
Just look at the time we've saved
Nothing unlocks a meal's flavor potential
Like turning up a faucet head from pulse to spray

We're eating food in the shower
Ain't this romantic, it's just like rain
Although I've definitely had crispier toast in my life
And there's a huge amount of bacon
Collecting in your drain Wooo!

That's right, girl. Don't things taste better when we're naked?
I gotta tell you I - whoops.
Sorry I'll get that, that was...
WHOA Whoa whoa. Sorry sorry sorry. Sorry, that was me.

Now it's later at night, and the mood is right for lovin
It's our 3 day anniversary, let's celebrate
Reservation for two at a candlelight dinner
Right inside your own bathroom, what a convenient date!

Sit down at the tub-shaped table
Give your order to the waiter
And hold my pruney hand
I also hired a harpist and mariachi band (mi amor!)

Eating food in the shower
But just between us I don't deny
All the drinks are watered down, there's shampoo in my tacos
Also I asked a bunch of friends if they would like to stop by (hi!)

We're eating food in the shower
This is the pinnacle of your year
The night is only getting better as we get wetter and wetter
Hey is this mayo or conditioner I have no idea

Man, it's getting crowded in here. Let's towel off. Oh God, the Mariachi band!!!
