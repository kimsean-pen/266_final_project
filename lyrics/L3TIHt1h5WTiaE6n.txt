They've written songs at two am
they've told us how they've written them
and the stories are endearing
and even cuter when they start to sing

in every month there comes a day
i wish that i could go away
to a universe where i'm just as creative too,
and every night my thoughts are new

before I fall asleep at three,
the second hour brings jealousy
there's the geniuses and then there's me
scrolling through clickbait endlessly

so i present to you a single
last minute little jingle
and if you feel that it is forced, what's it to you?
at least it's something to do

something to do
something to do
something to do

they're staying up all night to sing
so what if I don't do a thing
I think I'll expire at a tired rate in my bedspace
I'll let creation take a break

but as for now it's two am
it's been a three year long attempt
and it's been slow and it's been so forced too
but it's something to do
