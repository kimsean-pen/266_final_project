Here goes another late night call
Waiting on another black line
Tick tock
My body clock
Impatient and sleepless inside
I wanna way out
A way round
A new ground to stand on
A better view
I got you in fragments
Pixels I pull apart won't do

Now the weakening lights running out
Running out
Running out
And my weekend nights just starting out
Starting out
Starting out
The signal we got's breaking up
Breaking up
Breaking up
Glitching the picture of you my love
I need a (Hi def distance)

Send me videos from your mother's home
Make it feel like I'm standing at your side
(Hi def distance)
Put me on cruise control
I feel your tone but I can't read the signs
And when I'm waking up, you're turning down
That's when you want me around
Come closer
I got you in private
There's too many windows I can't climb through

Now the weakening lights running out
Running out
Running out
And my weekend nights just starting out
Starting out
Starting out
The signal we got's breaking up
Breaking up
Breaking up
Glitching the picture of you my love

Hi def distance romance
Hi def distance romance
Hi def distance romance
Hi def distance romance

Now the weakening lights running out
Running out
Running out
And my weekend nights just starting out
Starting out
Starting out
The signal we got's breaking up
Breaking up
Breaking up
Glitching the picture of you my love
