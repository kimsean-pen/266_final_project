And God said,
Let there be lights
In the firmament
Of the heaven.

Let there be lights in heaven to divide the day from the night;
And let them be for signs, for seasons and for days (and years);
And let them be for lights up there in the firmament
To give light upon the earth.

And it was so, and God made two, two great lights;
The greater light to rule the day,
And the lesser light to rule the night; the stars as well.
And God set them in the firmament
To give light upon the earth.

And to rule, to rule over the day and over the night
To divide darkness from the light.

Let there be
A firmament
In the midst
Of the waters.

[(repeated)]

And God said, let the waters bring forth, abundantly,
The moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly
Above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
...Or so do some people believe.

Above the earth in the open firmament
And to rule, to rule over the day and over the night
To divide darkness from the light.

Let there be
A firmament
In the midst
Of the waters.

[(repeated)]
