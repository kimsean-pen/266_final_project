Find the floor in all exhuberance
Have to warm up to the feel of it
Often meek to the Nth degree
But the night's so thick that I forgot to leave
Communion in the cruch of grease
Cellphone like a rosary
Throbbing bodies pound around
And then nestle into wreaths

What am I gonna do with me
All this gloss and all its goblins
At the shattered ego club
Come fail at love (and celebrate your stupid fate)
Walls lined in every color
Of every iris of every lover

All your thoughts
And all your problems
At the shattered ego club
Come fail at love (and celebrate your stupid fate)
Walls lined in every color
Of every iris of every lover

Who are any of the men I've done
What subtle hell are they born of
Salt the exits of the room
Don't let them get to you
Enough is enough is enough is enough
Salt the earth under the cliques
Cool is not so tough
Will I let the salt flow from my eyes or my armpits

All our loss, we're all so maudlin
At the shattered ego club
Come fail at love (and celebrate your stupid fate)
Walls lined in every color
Of every iris of every lover

All your thoughts
And all your problems
At the shattered ego club
Come fail at love (and celebrate your stupid fate)
Walls lined in every color
Of every iris of every lover
Enough is enough is enough is enough
Is enough is enough is enough
And celebrate your stupid fate
Walls lined in every color
Of every iris of every lover
And celebrate your stupid fate
Walls lined in every color
Of every iris of every iris
Of every iris of every lover
