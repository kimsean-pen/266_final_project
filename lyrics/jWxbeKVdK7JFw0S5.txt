One day all this will make sense
But just promise me you won't ever forget
There are two kinds of men in this world
Ones who move on, stroll on and ones who never learn
Don't you need me? At least to tell you what you're worth
I've been waiting too long and no, it doesn't hurt
To be moving on, strolling along, I think that I can learn
Oh we'll see how much you think I'm really worth

Deep down mysteries can't be solved yet, can't you see?
I got a little black present hiding for you under your seat
Deep down mysteries can't be solved yet, can't you see?
I got a little black present hiding for you under your seat

Deep down mysteries can't be solved yet, can't you see?
I got a little black present hiding for ya under your seat
Deep down mysteries can't be solved yet, can't you see?
I got a little black present hiding for ya under your seat
