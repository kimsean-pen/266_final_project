You'll have to stand perfectly still
You have to close your eyes
And when I am finished
I don't believe you can go

Everyone else in the world
Would love me by now
Would love me from day one
But not you

Everyone else in the world
Would love me by now
Would love me in a crowd
But not you

False promises of love
Still promise love
You get what you want
When you just
Want what you get

Everyone else in the world
Would love me by now
Would love me from day one
But not you

Everyone else in the world
Would love me by now
Would love me in a crowd
But not you
