Forgiveness
Makes fools
Of all
Of us

Alone to face
A hostile place
A moment's peace ain't coming

The constant cold
Cracking your bones
The stench of life worth living

The line in the sand ain't drawn for everyone
The flag in your hand don't make you American
Stripping your soul back, be forever young
Forever young
Forever young

Forgiveness
Makes fools
Of all
Of us

Wake up, walk on
You are alone
The world you're in's too heavy

But soak your skin
In love and sin
Falling like confetti

The line in the sand ain't drawn for everyone
The flag in your hand don't make you American
Stripping your soul back, be forever young
Forever young
Forever young

Forgiveness
Makes fools
Of all
Of us

Forgiveness
Makes fools
Of all
Of us

The line in the sand ain't drawn for everyone
The flag in your hand don't make you American
Stripping your soul back, be forever young
Forever young
Forever young

Forgiveness
Makes fools
Of all
Of us

Forgiveness
Makes fools
Of all
Of us

Forgiveness
Makes fools
Of all
Of us

Forgiveness
Makes fools
Of all
Of us
