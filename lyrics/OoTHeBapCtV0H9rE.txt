(clapping)
hey where did we godays when the rains came
down in the hallow
playin the new game
laughin and a runnin' hey hey
skippin an a jumpin'
in the misty morning fog oh
my hearts a thumpin and you
my brown eyed girl
you my brown eyed girl
and what ever happened
the tuesday was so slow
gone down the old man witha
transista radio
standin in the sunlight laughing
hiding hind the rainbow wall
slippin and a slidin
all along the waterfall
my brown eyed girl
you my brown eyed girl

cast from every backround law
sometime over come thikin bout ya
makin love in the green grass
