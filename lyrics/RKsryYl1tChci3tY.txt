She's in my head agin
She knows where I have been
I'm going down that road again
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha
Ah-ha, ah-ha

She's in my bed again
She marks her fingerprints
In my skin
I breathe her perfume in
And it burns like heroin

Now she's in me
And I can't let her go
And my bones are caving in
And she stole my faith again
And I wish you well
Oh, for the night
'Til you come again

She's in my veins again
But she knows that I'll bleed her out
Before I wake
Exhale her oxygen
She burns like heroin

Now she's in me
And I can't let her go
And my bones are caving in
Oh
She stole my faith again
And I wish you well
Oh, for the night

She's in my life again
But she won't ever win
And I wish you well
For the night
For the night
My bones are caving in
Oh
She stole my faith again
I wish you well
For the night
For the night
