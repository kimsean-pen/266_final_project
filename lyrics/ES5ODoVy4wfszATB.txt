Self control
Self control

I can always watch you
Breathing in your sleep
And all I ever wanted was for you to wait for me
It's hard to take it easy
When you're not satisfied
A little death is better with
Somebody at your side

You need to
Self control
Gonna teach you
Self control
Just keep staring at the ceiling
Got to learn to fight the feeling
Don't let go
No no
Of your self control
Self control

Just pretend you're standing
High up on this ledge
Be sure not to look down if you're close to the edge
Tell me are you listening
Stay within my voice
Ain't no rush
Just feel the push
Cause you don't have much choice

You need to
Self control
Gonna teach you
Self control
Just keep staring at the ceiling
Got to learn to fight the feeling
Don't let go
No no
Of your self control
Self control

Who has to know

Gonna teach you
Self control
Gonna teach you
Self control
Just keep staring at the ceiling
Got to learn to fight the feeling
Don't let go
No no
Of your self control
Self control

Self control
