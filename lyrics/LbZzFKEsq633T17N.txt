Baby come fall away with me
Baby you and I were meant to be
Baby come fall away with me
Baby you and I were meant to be

It's been too long since I kissed you
And baby girl you know I miss you
No it's no excuse, for my behavior
Baby girl, I'm sorry that I played ya
It's been too long since I kissed you
And baby girl you know I miss you
No it's no excuse, for my behavior
Baby girl, I'm sorry that I played ya

You're the only one that makes my heart beat
You're the only reason that I still breathe
Fall away I feel it, its so soothing
The look in your eyes is so moving
You're the only one that makes my heart beat
You're the only reason that I still breathe
Fall away I feel it, its so soothing
The look in your eyes is so moving

That moment, when you kiss someone and everything around you becomes
hazy and the only thing in focus is you and this person and you
realize that that person is the only person that
you're supposed to kiss for the rest of your life

Just looking at you is so moving
And bring it back down how you do it
Just looking at you is so moving
And bring it back down how you do it

You're the only one that makes my heart beat
You're the only reason that I still breathe
Fall away I feel it, its so soothing
The look in your eyes is so moving

Baby come and fall away with me (fall away)
Baby come fall away, fall away, with me
Baby come and fall away with me (fall away)
Baby come fall away, fall away, with me
