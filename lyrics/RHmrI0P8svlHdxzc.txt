The sea calls, out to an old hand
To go sailing to new lands
They pay for your worth
Bread drink and a berth... Ah honey I've got to go

The ship took the crew off to new lands
The boson piped all hands
And with it you'll go
A journey to the unknown... Ah honey I've got to go

The road bends, back to where we sent
The signals out to the men
Did they make it on board
With fire and the sword?

Ah honey I've got to go
Can you hear the winds blow?
It shakes your spirit and your soul

I've tried, to stay true and stay on land
But the call of the ocean
Is so hard to ignore
It's why I'm leaving your door... Ah honey, I've got to go

I've seen, a ship with a black sail
When the wind howls and the ghosts wail
Dead men they don't bite
Their faces haunt me at night

Ah honey I've got to go
Can you hear the waves roar?
And no sound of the shore
It shakes you spirit and your soul

I dream of sailing the oceans
In a galleon all golden
Dead trees in the hearth
The way they burn it warms the heart... Ah honey I've got to go

The years passed, we travelled and sailed west
I'll buy you a new dress
With all of my gold
Free your spirit and your soul

Ah honey, I've got to go
Can you hear the winds blow?
Shakes your spirit and your soul
I've got to go...
