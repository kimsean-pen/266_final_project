So cold, in the night
Where the river flows
Where the river flows
So cold, in the night
Where the river flows
Where the river flows

Sail away
Hey, I'm sorry
Every day's a new day.
Hooray for love
Hey, I'm only
Trying to find a new way.

So cold, in the night
When the river's low
When the river's low
So cold, in the night
Where the river slows
When the river's low
So cold
Shut it!

So cold, in the night
Hold on
Hold on
So cold, in the night
Hold on
Hold on

Sail away
Hey I'm sorry
Every day's a new day
Hooray for love
Hey, I'm lonely
Trying to find a new way
A new way...
A new way...
A new way...
She loves me!
