If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing that you lied straight faced while I cried
Still I'd look to find a reason to believe
Someone like you, makes it hard to live without somebody else
Someone like you, makes it easy to give, never thinkin' of myself
If you took the time to change my mind
I'd find a way to leave the past behind
Knowing that you lied, straight faced, while I cried
Still I look, to find a reason to believe
Someone like you, makes it hard to live without somebody else
Someone like you, makes it easy to give, never thinkin' of myself
If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing that you lied straight faced while I cri-ied
Still I'd look to find a reason to believe
Someone like you, makes it hard to live without somebody else
Someone like you, makes it easy to give, never thinkin' of myself
