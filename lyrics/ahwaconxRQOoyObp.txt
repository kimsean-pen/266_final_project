Hordes of faces, empty eyes, I see nothing new
Seasoned schemes of slimy curs offer up their flu
Am I beast or am I human, am I just like you?
Power seething, really reeling, reaching out for you

Am I Demon?
You need to know

Faces of one million hells, rage inside these veins
Pounding out deserved the pain, to anyone in need
Am I beast or am I human, am I just like you?
Power seething, really reeling, reaching out for you

Am I Demon?
Need to know
Demon am I, oh yeah

Am I Demon?
Need to know
Demon oh well then I'll like it
Alright

Every world and every limb torn asunder base
Everything I need is me, everything I am
Am I beast or am I human, am I just like you?
Power seething, really reeling, reaching out for you

Am I Demon?
You need to know
Demon oh well then I'll like it oh, oh yeah

Am I Demon?
Need to know
