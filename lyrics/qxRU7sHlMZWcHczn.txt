Our love is underlined
'Cause she wants it all the time
And Gil Scott's a friend of mine
And southern hummingbird's a friend of mine

Our love is underlined
Our love is underlined
Our love is underlined
Our love is underlined

Our love is underlined
'Cause she wants it all the time
And Gil Scott's a friend of mine
And southern hummingbird's a friend of mine

I know I'm willing, babe, to go the whole way
We could never be alone
When you go you're all I'm thinking of
With love I'll get you anyway

Our love is underlined
Our love is underlined
Our love is underlined
Our love is underlined
That girl's no friend of mine

And it might be hard sometimes
Keep looking at me, bright eyes
While we're holding hands tonight
We're still in love underlined

And it might be hard sometimes
Keep looking at me wide eyed
While we're holding hands tonight
We're still in love underlined
