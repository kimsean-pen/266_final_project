I wanna feel just like before
Before the rain came in my door
Sme up, turned me 'round
Made me cry 'til I would drown
Stole the daylight brought them nights
So much anger I would fight
Lost my youth, amid the blue
Saw all the loneliness in you
Want to help you, give you love
Shine some light out from the mud
Build the empty final rhyme
A brighter day, a better time
But I'm wondering where I'm gone
Can't find the truth within my song
All I have I'll give to you
To let you know you're not alone
I'm telling you
Smiling for you only
I'm trying for you solely
I'm praying for you only
No more cry, no more cry
I want to hear you laugh again
Without the ache to bring you down
No, we'll never be the same
If only I could take your pain
If it's true what people say
There still is beauty in each day
We find comfort in her strength
And wonder soon we'll meet again
I'm telling you
Smiling for you only
I'm trying for you solely

I'm praying for you only
No more cry, no more cry
I'm singing for you only
Hey, I'll be weary for you only
I'm praying for you only
No more cry, no more cry
Reach out for your love (love)
Shout out for your love (love)
You'll send for your love (love)

Believe in her love

I'm telling you
I'm telling you
Smiling for you only
I'm trying for solely
I'm praying for you only
No more cry, no more cry
I'm singing for you only
Hey, I'll be weary for you only
But it's you 'saved me from lonely
No more cry, no more cry
No, no more cry (no more cry)
No more cry (no more cry)
No more cry (no more cry)
No more cry
