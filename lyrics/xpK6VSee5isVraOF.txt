There were Chevys and levies,
whiskey and rye, friends and no end to the summertime.
Gas was cheap and the radio was free.
So were we on those back streets.
Chasing good times and pretty girls.
Cuz when you're young, you hold on and
Its Bloodshot eyes,
watch the sunrise, sleep when you die, phase of life.
It's a full heart, falling hard, singing songs to her in the dark.
Drinking up every moment until it's gone, just Rockin all night long.
There's a knowing you know kind of feeling you
get when that lightning strikes on that first kiss.
When she smiled I had no doubts,
so I put a ring on that finger I was wrapped around.
We were midnight holding on, giving in to what the heart wants.
It was a bloodshot eyes,
watch the sunrise, sleep when you die, phase of life.
It's a full heart, falling hard, singing songs to her in the dark.
Drinking up every moment until it's gone, just Rockin all night long.
Now it's 2 a.
m.
and I'm in a rocking chair, rose pink everywhere.
She's got her mama smile and a nose like her dad.
She's the best reason I've ever had
For bloodshot eyes watch the
sunrise, sleep when you die, phase of life.
It's a full heart, falling hard, singing songs to her in the dark.
And drinking up every moment until it's gone,
and were gonna be here til the break
of dawn, just Rockin all night long.
Just rockin all night long.
Just rockin all night.
Rockin all night long.
