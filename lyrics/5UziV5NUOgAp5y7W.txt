I've got a sea of flowers
But all these hours are just mine alone
No one's home
Buy me the finest china
Each time I dine it's always me alone
With the heater on

Left to your own devices
A master of disguises
Why is that not surprising?
It's like you're Midas

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Now all I see is gold, all I see is gold
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Now all I see is gold, all I see is gold

You're probably somewhere sunny
And I'm here wondering if you dream of me
While you're by the sea
Of all the people passing
Your face appears in every one I see
But you're not with me

And now I just can't tell if
That's just the way you felt when
We were just beginning
You've turned to Midas

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Now all I see is gold, all I see is gold
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Now all I see is gold, all I see is gold

And when you hold my hand
I don't feel anything
All I feel is cold
And all I see is gold
Ooh, it's like you're Midas

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Now all I see is gold, all I see is gold
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
All I see is gold, all I see is gold
Oooh, all I see is gold
All I see is gold, all I see is gold
