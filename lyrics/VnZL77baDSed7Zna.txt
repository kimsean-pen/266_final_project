I've been pushing stones away
Far from these shores
I pretend that it's all okay
Till on the brink of what can't be adored

We survived
Well we can change
So let it fade
Just let it go
We pretend so nothing does change

We're flowers never breaking through the stone
...
I pretended and prayed it all away
Searching for a place to hide

But I don't need afflicted memories to fade
I just wanna feel something real inside
And we survive
Well we can change
So let it fade
Let it go

We pretend so nothing does change
We're flowers never breaking through the stone.

I've been pushing stones away

Far from these shores
I pretend that it's all okay
To no longer bring what can be adored
We survived
Well we can change
So let it fade
Just let it go
We pretend so nothing does change
We're flowers never breaking through
We survived
Well we can change
So let it fade
Just let it go
We pretend so nothing does change
We're flowers never breaking through the stone
