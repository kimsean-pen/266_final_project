It's a new wave crashing in the ocean
Infinity, crystal creation
Memory whisper over water
Come with me, let's be like the ocean

Come wash the clouds away
Can't wait for summer
Come wash the clouds away
Can't wait for summer

Before I met you
I was lost at sea

It's a new wave crashing in the ocean
Infinity, crystal creation
Memory whisper over water
Come with me, let's be like the ocean

Come wash the clouds away
Can't wait for summer
Come wash the clouds away
Can't wait for summer

Life was just a photo
Faded on my desk while I was ruling the world [?]
Swim against the current
Losing my direction
But I did not left no one [?]

Before I met you
I was lost at sea

I won't be far from the ocean of you
Never undone, know where I'm done
I can't be far from whatever I need
Bluest ocean, bluer ocean

I won't be far from the ocean of you
Never undone, know where I'm done
I can't be far from whatever I need
Bluest ocean, bluer ocean
