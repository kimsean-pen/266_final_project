Posted up, fours got stained from everything
Sippy cups, here's to us and no one else
You're like me, piece by piece you fall apart
Island home, ain't a terrible start

Half moon, hey to the daytime
Blueberry knees feeling just fine, yeah
Break up, down in the backyard
This simple season is all ours, yeah

Friendly storms seem to pull us back
Still lukewarm ashtray heart attacks
Daffodils, happy pills and harriet strikes

Half moon, hey to the daytime
Blueberry knees feeling just fine, yeah
Break up, down in the backyard
This simple season is all ours, yeah
Lake scene, knee deep in the stars
This simple season is all ours, yeah

Sweet love, kiss on the eyelid
Bruised up, chasing the sky, did
You say something about her
My legs brush up beside her

Too young looking for trouble
New god, lost in the struggle
One more night in the backyard
This simple season

This simple season is all ours
