LOOK

One day. Once more. One way to somewhere.
What are you thinking about?
What are you going to find?
You should look inside
This way's a long way.
But anyway, this prayer
can help you,
when you're not O.K.
Every day
You have to decide

Look inside yourself
More and more and more and more

When you feel lost,
When you are refused,
And when you feel confused,
When you are so used,
You should look inside
You don't know what's next.
It's all gone.
You should leave your nest.
Just analyse your map.
Make a final step.
You have to decide
