You mistake my passion for anger
Should I sit polite in the silence
So quick in pointing the finger
I got sick of taking the blame

If there's a price to pay for your acceptance
A sacrifice for your judgment
I guess I have to learn a lesson
Now I'm not afraid to say

I can be like a raging storm
Don't got asking me for apologies
I'll sing 'till you hear my song
This time you better believe that there's
No way I'm holding back anymore
I'm slaying like the queen of swords
La la ly la la ly la la ly la la ly ly
I'm slaying like the queen of swords

I can be delicate as a flower
Or a warrior on a throne
There's life for us to devour
Even if we do it alone

When I look into the future
I see my story my in the cards
Some days just hard and the truth hurts
But I never trade my broken heart

I can be like a raging storm
Don't got asking me for apologies
I'll sing 'till you hear my song
This time you better believe that there's
No way I'm holding back anymore
I'm slaying like the queen of swords

La-la-ly, la-la-ly, la-la-ly-ly
La-la-ly, la-la-ly, la-la-ly-ly
La-la-ly, la-la-ly, la-la-ly-ly
I'm slaying like the queen of swords
La-la-ly, la-la-ly, la-la-ly-ly
La-la-ly, la-la-ly, la-la-ly-ly
La-la-ly, la-la-ly, la-la-ly-ly
I'm slaying like the queen of swords

Hey!

Hey!

Hey!

I can be like a raging storm
(Don't go asking me for apologies)
I can sing 'till you hear my song
(This time you better believe that there's)
There's no way I'm holding back anymore
I'm slaying like the queen of swords

La-la-ly, la-la-ly, la-la-ly-ly
La-la-ly, la-la-ly, la-la-ly-ly
La-la-ly, la-la-ly, la-la-ly-ly
I'm slaying like the queen of swords

I'm gonna live to seize the moment
(La-la-ly, la-la-ly, la-la-ly-ly)
Leaving nothing left unsaid
(La-la-ly, la-la-ly, la-la-ly-ly)
I'm standing here wide open
(La-la-ly, la-la-ly, la-la-ly-ly)
This queen has no regrets

La-la-ly, la-la-ly, la-la-ly-ly
La-la-ly, la-la-ly, la-la-ly-ly
La-la-ly, la-la-ly, la-la-ly-ly
I'm slaying like the queen of swords
La-la-ly, la-la-ly, la-la-ly-ly
La-la-ly, la-la-ly, la-la-ly-ly
La-la-ly, la-la-ly, la-la-ly-ly
I'm slaying like the queen of swords
La-la-ly, la-la-ly, la-la-ly-ly
La-la-ly, la-la-ly, la-la-ly-ly
La-la-ly, la-la-ly, la-la-ly-ly
