this is a sunny sky, this is a starry night
this is an afternoon I'll spend inside your arms, held tight
this is a question mark, this is a final thought
this is a separate building, this is a journey there
this is a promise kept, an honored lesson, taught it to you
always terribly afraid to make mistakes and make you leave
It's a shame i'm scared of heights, 'cause when you sweep me off my feet
It's just too hard to explain, so i'm repeating myself, like.

this is a broken record, this is a broken record
this is a broken record, you'll always know me better
this is a broken record, this is a broken record
this is a broken record, so i'll be yours forever

this is absolute bliss, this can fit like a glove
i'm not a hundred percent sure, but still
this here, this is a final draft, this is an epitath
for every negative emotion on a seperate path
and honestly, this is my magnum opus, this is a story book
a cordial shook hand at an important event
with stainless steel silverware and a porcelain dish
a metaphor used precisely to make it more than it is

this is a broken record, this is a broken record
this is a broken record, you'll always know me better
this is a broken record, this is a broken record
this is a broken record, so i'll be yours forever

this is a broken record, this is a broken record
this is a broken record, you'll always know me better
this is a broken record, this is a broken record
this is a broken record, so i'll be yours forever
