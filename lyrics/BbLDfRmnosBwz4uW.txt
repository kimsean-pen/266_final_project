my mother once told me
she walked into the ocean
didn't want to die
just couldn't tell where the horizon was
wanted to have a closer look
why is this costume weighing me down?

and my head hurts
air to sails down (?)

tired of being lonely
trying to rest and I don't wanna get up
error lies in hopin'
when I'm walking and my dear is running
lines, lines on the back of my hand
why does love keep letting me down?

my head hurts
prepare to sail down

write the lines with the back of my hand
why does love keep letting me down?

why does love keep letting me down?

letting me down
