It's just what all young lovers do
(00: 08.08)It's just what all young lovers do

I noticed you
You stood out like a sore thumb
The most beautiful sore thumb I'd ever seen

I took you out
And I showed you a good time
Danced all night, and I waited 'til the time was right

You say
Never wrong, never right. Never wrong, never right
Echo, echo, my mind
I say
It's just what all young lovers do

Do you recall
The night that we first met?
And how I burnt your dress with my cigarette

I don't know why
But I'm playing this game, for you
I'm guessing it's just what all young lovers do

You say
Never wrong, never right. Never wrong, never right
Echo, echo, my mind
I say
It's just what all young lovers do

Yes they do

(Never wrong never right never wrong never right)

Yes they do

Echo her
Echo her
Echo her
Echo

It's just what all young lovers do (x4)
