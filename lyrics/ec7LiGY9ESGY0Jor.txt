Kiss the tattoos on my neck, baby tell me that you love me
Pick you up in a Ferrari, fuck you in the front seat
Don't judge me, just trust me

Kiss the tattoos on my neck, baby tell me that you love me
Pick you up in a Ferrari, fuck you in the front seat
Don't judge me, just trust me
Let me know your secrets, I'm a diary
(Let me know your secrets, I'm a diary)

Voices in my head, but i can't understand them
(i can't understand them)
I'm gettin rich, i'ma die in a mansion
(I'm gotta die in a mansion)

Tatted on my face, baby i'm a sinner
I can't see myself inside the mirror
My heart is cold I just wanna make you shiver
I want this forever like a picture
(My heart is cold I just wanna make you shiver)
Kiss the tattoos on my neck, baby tell me that you love me
Pick you up in a Ferrari, fuck you in the front seat
Don't judge me, just trust me
Let me know your secrets, I'm a diary
