appear distracted
the only way to move on
so much to flee from
lets call me bitter and old
250 milligrams of escape
more weeks of tv
as someone forgets my name
a brand new diet
a weeks vacation i saved
i'd better settle for settling
in you'll see me happy
when all the bastards are dead
when counting heartbeats
means i am still alive

and all of a sudden this
insight crashes down
i'm all out of memories
they somehow wore out

who watches watchmen?
who takes control of your life?
so much to choose from
that i've got no choices left
stay well-behaved and
be good looking when you mourn
all with a surface
but certainly no within talk of progression no matter how hard you try
this disillusion will most likely get you too
you'll see me happy when all the bastards are dead
when counting heartbeats means i've not given in
