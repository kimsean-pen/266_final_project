Now here comes a special request
To each and everyone
Especially those of my brethren
Who forget where they are coming from, you know
This song is called roots and culture

SKEP SKEBBE DEP SKEP
SKEBBE DEBBE DEP SKEBBE DEP SKEP SCOYE
SKEP SKEBBE DEP SKEP
SKEBBE DEBBE DEP SKEBBE DEP SKEP SCOYE

Don't you bite the hands that feed you
My brethren no
Don't you bite the hands that feed you
Don't you burn your bridges then behind you
My brethren no
Don't you burn your bridges them behind you

Cause if you burn your bridges down
That is a wrong thing to do
The good you do today will surely live after you
I say
Don't you bite the hands that feed you my brethren no
Don't you bite the hands that feed you

SKEBBE DEP SKEBBE DEP SKEP
SKEBBE DEBBE DEP SKEBBE DEP SKEP SCOYE
SKEP SKEBBE DEP SKEP
SKEBBE DEBBE DEP SKEBBE DEP SKEP SCOYE

Remember the days of bread and water man
Remember the days of hunger
Don't forget your roots and culture
My brethren say
Remember your place of shelter
Cause if you deal with war man
You can't run far
You deal with grudge
You a go melt like fudge
Don't you bite the hands that feed you my brethren no
Don't you bite the hands that feed you no

Don't you bite the hands that feed you my brethren no
Don't you bite the hands that feed you
Don't you burn your bridges them behind you my brethren no
Don't you burn your bridges them behind you
Cause if you deal with war man you can't run far
You deal with grudge
You a go melt like fudge mi say
Don't you bite the hands that feed you mi brethren say
Don't you bite the hands that feed you no

Remember your roots and culture my brethren say
Remember your place of shelter
Don't forget the days of bread and water man
Remember the days of hunger
For you never miss the water till the well runs dry
You spit ina the sky
It a go fall ina you eye mi say
Don't you bite the hands that feed you my brethren no
Don't you bite the hands that feed you

SKE DEP SKEBBE DEP SKEP
SKEBBE DEBBE DEP SKEBBE DEP SKEP SCOYE
(repeat)
