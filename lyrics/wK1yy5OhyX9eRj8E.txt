I'm Aporia's friend
Loneliness rides in my bed
My misfortune
Give everything you've got
While the sun burns hot
My addiction
Spoils my affection
For everything good

Elephant in the room
Might as well shoot at the moon
The mild ambition
Give everything you've got
Jump the Fosbury flop with intention
Pursue your invention
As something of worth

The thing I most regret
Is having to repress what I'm feeling
While expressing delight as a myth
Embrace the epic fail
Of my exploding whale

Poison or powdered milk (poison or powdered milk)
Paralyzed as it took (paralyzed as it took)
Premonition (what is going on?)
Give everything you've got
Before your life is caught in conditions
Be the first of its victims
The foot of a hare

Action or consequence (action or consequence)
My unyielding defense (my unyielding defense)
Superstition (what is going on?)
My attempts to obscure
The wonders of this world
Be it fortune
Or faith in distortion
The patron of prayer

The thing I most resent
Is having to consent to illusion
While confessing distress with my fist
Will history prevail?
My exploding whale

What of a dream deferred
My appeal in reverse
Apparition

Embrace the epic fail
Of my exploding whale
