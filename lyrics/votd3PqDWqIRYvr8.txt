Something you've expected for me
As you laid next to me this morning
As you look up into my eyes, suddenly I realize
What I've been searching for I no longer have to look no more
A chance to find the soul mate for my life, has realized the one that I am

There's a feeling no I can describe
No, I can't describe
But I know the feeling's here tonight
Is here tonight
Desire goes near to my bared soul
My, my bared soul
My feelings and my fears I'm letting go, I'm letting go

Love is love you can't buy love, is a gift not an obligation
It cannot lead you to temptation
Love is love, not a game, and should always remain so
Love is love you can't buy love, is a gift not an obligation
It cannot lead you to temptation
Love is love not a game and should always remain so

Love is to've your heart open
Love is never act like a friend
It's the little things we do, and at
Time they come from you, uhh

Laughter, anger, tears, or joy
It's the love that we unknow, me and you
The pictures like the sun, ahh, ahh, love is love

It's a feeling I can't comprehend
No I, no I, but I know to keep it I intend
To keep it I intend
Desire goes near to my bared soul
My, my bared soul
My feelings and my fears
I'm letting go
I'm letting go

Love is love you can't buy love
Is a gift not an obligation
It cannot lead you to temptation
Love is love, not a game
And should always remain so
