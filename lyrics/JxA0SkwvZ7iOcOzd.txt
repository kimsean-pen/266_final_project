I won't wait this time
No, not now, not again
Not much longer
Heavy weight works my
Mind all night it's so hard
Not to ponder

Let's make it last forever
'Cause the night's still young
It's true, I feel the pressure
Every time you're gone
As long as we're together
This moment lasts forever

And what will she say
Would my heart be torn?
Maybe the same helps to keep her warm
Maybe she's too shy to comment
Twenty one and too hard to call it

Let's make it last forever
'Cause the night's still young
It's true, I feel the pressure
Every time you're gone
As long as we're together
This moment lasts forever

Let's make it last forever
'Cause the night's still young
It's true, I feel the pressure
Every time you're gone
As long as we're together
This moment lasts forever
