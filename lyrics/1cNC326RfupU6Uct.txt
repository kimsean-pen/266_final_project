I am down at the water
My bare feet are numb
And for aeons now nothing seems real

Now it's hard to hold sight
Through your soft eiderdown
But I still got my hands on the wheel

You can rain down on me
But you can't darken the sun
You can cast a spell on the moon
But you can't kill the sun

You have set my mind
Between worlds spinning round
I'm a stranger in my universe

But I see my sun
And I know that it will
Be forever shining on earth

You can rain down on me
But you can't darken the sun
You can cast a spell on the moon
But you can't kill the sun

You can't kill the sun
You can't kill the sun
You can't kill the sun

You can rain down on me
But you can't darken the sun
You can cast a spell on the moon
But you can't kill the sun
Kill the sun
