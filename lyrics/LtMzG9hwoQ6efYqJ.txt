Life, it goes
And comes
And stays
Stare into
The sun
For days

Falling, falling, falling
For another daydream
I'll take a sea of leaves
And another really green

Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh
Can you see what
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh
Can you see what
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh
Is surrounding you

Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh
What I'm feeling
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh
What I feel
When I'm with you
And you take me away

I can't replace
All of our affection
Obscure but visible
Diamond shines

Falling, falling, falling
For another daydream
I'll take a sea of leaves
And another really green

Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh
Can you see what
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh
Can you see what
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh
Is surrounding you

Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh
What I'm feeling
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh
What I feel
When I'm with you
And you take me away

Life is short
But love is long
Take a breath
And carry on

Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh
Can you see what
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh
Can you see what
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh
Is surrounding you

Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh
What I'm feeling
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh
What I feel
When I'm with you
And you take me away
