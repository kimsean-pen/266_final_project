You have the bravest heart
The strongest emotions
After all the harm I have caused
You still want my loving

I think I've lost your love
Oh baby it's a shame
But how can I be mad at you
When I'm the one to blame

You have the bravest heart
The strongest emotions
After all the harm I have caused
You still want my loving

I can't believe
I still receive
So much affection from your side
If you could give me one more chance
I'd love to turn the tide

I can't believe
I still receive
So much affection from your side
If you could give me one more chance
I'd love to turn the tide

I can't believe
I still receive
So much affection from your side
If you could give me one more chance
I'd love to turn the tide

I can't believe
I still receive
So much affection from your side
If you could give me one more chance
I'd love to turn the tide

You have the bravest heart
The strongest emotions
After all the harm I have caused
You still want my loving

I can't believe
I still receive
So much affection from your side
If you could give me one more chance
I'd love to turn the tide

I can't believe
I still receive
So much affection from your side
If you could give me one more chance
I'd love to turn the tide
