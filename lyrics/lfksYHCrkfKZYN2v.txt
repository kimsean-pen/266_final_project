Better the devil you know
Better the devil you know, oh
Better the devil you know
Better the devil you know, oh oh

Say you won't need me no more
I'll take you back again
No more excuses, no no
'Coz I've heard them all before
A hundred times or more

I'll forgive and forget
If you say you'll never go
'Coz it's true what they say
It's better the devil you know

Our love wasn't perfect, I know
I think I know the score
If you say you love me, oh boy
I can't ask for more
I'll come if you should call

I'll forgive and forget
If you say you'll never go
'Coz it's true what they say
It's better the devil you know

I'll be here every day
Waiting for your love to show
Yes, it's true, what they say
It's better the devil you know

Say you won't leave me no more
I'll take you back again
No more excuses no, no
'Coz I've heard them all before
A hundred times or more

I'll forgive and forget
If you say you'll never go
'Coz it's true what they say
It's better the devil you know

I'll be here every day
Waiting for your love to show
Yes, it's true, what they say
It's better the devil you know

I'll forgive and forget
If you say you'll never go
'Coz it's true what they say
It's better the devil you know

I'll be here every day
Waiting for your love to show
Yes, it's true, what they say
