As I was walking through a life one morning
The sun was out, the air was warm, but oh, I was cold
And though I must have looked a half a person
To tell the tale in my own version, it was only then that I felt whole

Do you believe in something beautiful?
Then get up and be it!

Fighting for the smallest goal, to get a little self-control
I know how hard you try, I see it in your eyes
But call your friends, 'cause we've forgotten what it's like to eat what's rotten
What's eating you alive might help you to survive

We went on as we were on a mission, latest in a grand tradition
But oh, what did we find?
It was ego who was flying the banner, and me and Mia, Ann and Anna
Oh, we'd been unkind

But do you believe in something beautiful?
Then get up and be it!

Fighting for the smallest goal, to get a little self-control
I see it in your eyes, I see it in your spine
But call your friends, 'cause we've forgotten what it's like to eat what's rotten
What's eating you alive might help you to survive

And even the nights, they could get better
And even the days ain't all that bad
And after a week of fighting, as more and more it seems the right thing
But do you believe in something beautiful? Then get up and be it!

Fighting for the smallest goal, to get a little self-control
Won't anybody here just let you disappear?
Not doctors, nor your mom and dad, but me and Mia, Ann and Anna
Know how hard you try, don't you see it in my eyes?

Sick to death of my dependence, fighting good to find transcendence
Fighting to survive, more dead but more alive
Cigarettes and speed for living, sleeping pills to feel forgiven
All that you contrive and all that you're deprived

All the bourgeois social angels telling you you've got to change
Don't have any idea, they'll never see so clear
But don't forget what it really means to hunger strike when you don't really need to
Some are dying for a cause but that don't make it yours

And even the nights, they could get better
