There's a strange pain in my heart
Beats in time like the sun
You're a far
It's a lie
You can't deny, sometimes you shine

So, I love you
I love you
I'm with you
Forever

I want a chance
Considering that I'm changing
Wanna love you more,
More than day

There is a hard look in your eye
There is a hard look in your eye

There's a strange pain in my heart
Beats in time like the sun
You're a far
It's a lie
You can't deny, sometimes you shine

So, I love you
I love you
I'm with you
Forever

I want a chance
Considering that I'm changing
Wanna love you more,
More than day

There is a hard look in your eye
There is a hard look in your eye

So, I love you
I love you
I'm with you
Forever
I want a chance
Considering that I'm changing
Wanna love you more,
More than day
