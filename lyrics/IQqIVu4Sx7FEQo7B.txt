Working my money 'till I get gold
Every Friday mornin'
Working my money if I need more
'Cause I can't get enough

Working my money 'till I get bored
Every Friday mornin'
Working my money 'till I get bored
'Cause I can't get enough

Started out with nothing
I still got most of that
The world ain't give me much
I'm positive that's a fact
Everybody said be cool, you be payin' your dues
Make a long story short, I got nothin' to lose

When I'll get it I ain't never going back again
When I'll get it I ain't never going back again
100% yeah, pure grinding
When I'll get it I ain't never going back again
When I'll get it I ain't never going back again
100% yeah, pure grinding
Oh yeah!

Working my money 'till I get bored
Every Friday mornin'
Working my money 'till I get bored
'Cause I can't get no more

Working my money 'till I get bored
Every Friday mornin'
Working my money 'till I get bored
'Cause I can't get no more

Try to make a dollar out of 50 cents
But I don't understand how the money's spent
My mama told me, boy you ain't got no sense
If you'd put it all together, you'll get to pay the rent
I've been to places, places I never should've been
I caught some changes,
changes that made who I am

When I'll get it I ain't never going back again
When I'll get it I ain't never going back again
100% yeah, pure grinding
When I'll get it I ain't never going back again
When I'll get it I ain't never going back again
100% yeah, pure grinding
Oh yeah!

Working my money 'till I get bored
Every Friday mornin'
Working my money 'till I get bored
'Cause I can't get no more

Working my money 'till I get bored
Every Friday mornin'
Working my money 'till I get bored
'Cause I can't get no more

Working my money 'till I get bored
Every Friday mornin'
Working my money 'till I get bored
'Cause I can't get no more
