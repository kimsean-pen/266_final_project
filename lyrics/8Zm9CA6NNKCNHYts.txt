Danger, oh, whoa
Wow! Yeah

I was headin' for the mountains
I had saved so much for you
And in the town I left behind me
There was nothin' left to do

I knew that you were waitin'
For me to save your life
'Cause I told you when I left
When I come back you'll be my wife

Someone was waitin'
In the shadows of the night
Someone was waitin'
It just didn't feel right

Danger on the track
(Oh oh)
Somethin' told me there were
Strangers on my back
(Oh oh)
Oh yeah

Danger on the track
(Oh oh)
Somethin' told me there were
Strangers on my back
(Oh oh)
And I was so right

Maybe I should surrender
And maybe I should give it up
But the strength I had inside
Told me you can never stop

The men wanted to break me
Steal and bring me down
But I fought for you and later
They were layin' on the ground

Someone was waitin'
In the shadows of the night
Someone was waitin'
It just didn't feel right

Danger on the track
(Oh oh)
Somethin' told me there were
Strangers on my back
(Oh oh)
Oh yeah

Danger on the track
(Oh oh)
Somethin' told me there were
Strangers on my back
(Oh oh)
And I was so right

Danger
Yeah, look out

Ah ah ah oh oh
Wow!

Someone was waitin'
In the shadows of the night
Someone was waitin'
(Oh oh)
It just didn't feel right
(Oh oh oh oh)

Danger on the track
(Oh oh)
Somethin' told me there were
Strangers on my back
(Oh oh)
Oh yeah

Danger on the track
(Oh oh)
Somethin' told me there were
Strangers on my back
(Oh oh)
I was so right
Yes, I was so right
It was danger on the track
