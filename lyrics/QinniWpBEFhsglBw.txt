I got a chopper
I got a chopper
Ain't helicopter
I got some problems
I got some problems
Drugs are my solvent now I'm gonna solve em
All of these bitches
All of these bitches gonna end up in ditches
Fuck with my emotions
Legs are spreadin open
Keep your pussy hoe and keep your attitude
Ima keep countin this cash
Money so long Imma change up my latitude
All of these drugs know my gratitude
All of these drugs know my gratitude
Face a whole blunt bitch that's how i go ghost
Turn into smoke
Perfect for hoes
Burnin gas all alone I'm never leavin home
Burnin gas all alone I'm never leavin home

Sleep on a couch
Cigarette in my mouth
Drugs in my house
I'm lookin for peace but I'm scattered beneath what's under my sheets
Got them bottles on the table
Codeine on the label
My life is far from stable
Take the gun then I disable
That's one in my temple with no hesitation
Don't fuck them bitches with love situations
Fixated on dope narcotics my salvation
I'm tryna get higher and higher and higher so high that i rise up and reach levitation
