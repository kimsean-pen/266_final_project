I got this thing in my head
When I awake in my bed
Well, I was thinking about you when...
I wondered if you thought about me
I've got a pain in my heart
Whenever we are apart
I've got a pain in my head
When I awake in my bed

And I was waiting there for you, you were waiting there for me
I was waiting there for you, you were waiting there for me

Ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha
I took the underground, I went eastbound
I went to Walthamstow
While you were waiting to see me there
I really, really want you to know
I'll never forget your kindness
I'll never forget your grace
I'll never forget your honor
You make the world a beautiful place

I was waiting there for you, you were waiting there for me
I was waiting there for you, you were waiting there for me

(Lalalala, lalalala-la, lalalala-la)
In Walthamstow, in Walthamstow, Walthamstow
I was waiting there for you, you were waiting there for me
I was waiting there for you, you were waiting there for me
