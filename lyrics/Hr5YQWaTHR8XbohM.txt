Dancing with your silhouette
In the places that we met
Ooh ooh ooh tryna find you in the moon
Paris never feels the same
When the streets all call your name
Ooh ooh ooh so I hide in crowded rooms

And I'll follow right down the river
Where the ocean meets the sky
To you, to you

Once upon a time we had it all
And somewhere down the line we went and lost it
One brick at a time we watched it fall
I'm broken here tonight and darling
No-one else can fix me

Only you
Only you
Oh no one else can fix me

Only you
Only you
Only You
Oh no one else can fix me
Only you

Only you
Only you
And no one else can fix me

Did I let go of your hand
For a castle made of sand
Ooh ooh that fell into the blue
I went following the sun
To be alone with everyone
Ooh ooh looking round a crowded room
And i'll follow right down the river
Where the ocean meets the sky
To you, to you

Once upon a time we had it all
And somewhere down the line we went and lost it
One brick at a time we watched it fall
I'm broken here tonight and darling
No one else can fix me

Only you
Only you
And no one else can fix me

Only you
Only you
Only You
And no one else can fix me
Only you

Only you
Only you
And no one else can fix me

And no one else can fix me
Only you
Only you
And no one else can fix me

Only you
Only you
Only You
And no one else can fix me
Only you
