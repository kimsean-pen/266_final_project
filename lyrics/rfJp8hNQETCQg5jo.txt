Yeah, I'ma missing you
Missing you...
Talk to you but it's not the same
As touching you
And every time you whisper my name
I wanna run to you
We'll be together
And it won't be long
It won't be long
But it seems like forever
And it's out of my arms
Baby, 'cuz I'm missing you now
And it's driving me crazy
'Cuz I'm needing my baby
I'm missing you now
Can't wait another moment
Baby, 'cuz I'm missing you now
Needing you right here by my side
Is all that I can do
Arms around my pillow at night
They should be holding you
I was much stronger
How could I know?
How could I know?
But it seems like forever
And it's hard to be strong
Baby, 'cuz I'm missing you now
And it's driving me crazy
I'm needing my baby
I'm missing you now
Can't wait another moment
Baby, 'cuz I'm missing you now
Said I'ma missing you now
And it's driving crazy
I'm needing my baby
I'm missing you now
Can't wait another moment
