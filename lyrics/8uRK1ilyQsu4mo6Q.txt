Girl just take off yo socks
Let me lick on yo feet

I'll rub yo body & watch you roll yo eyes to the ceiling
Won't you lay on down
Let my face be yo linen
C'mon and sho me yo ways
This is our honeymoon day (We've been waiting for this day)
Let's just free our bodies like the last day of living
Girl we can be real naughty there's no need for forgiving
Won't ya dance for me
Let my face be your mirror
C'mon and sho me yo ways
This is our honeymoon day (We've been waiting for this day)

(rrah)

It's ya charming one ranked at number one
The one you know to go to
When you need some lovin' to come
(rrah)
And even though I'm just
A hop & a skip and a jump
Away baby sometimes
We role play the funk (uh)
Yo secret thing like a one night fling
That just happened to be married to you and
Gave you a ring so no... guilt just pleasure
So much dat it's known to tilt the measure
Yo touch has been known to ease my pressure
Oh my God!
It's so incredible the way he shaped your bod
Ingenious mixing soft wit hard
Little sweet little heat spicy hot
Gotta a lot a seeds wanna put in yo sod
I can't see your face If ya feel me just knod
Girl yous da picket fence house and the yard
Da picket fence house and the yard
Hu huhhh

Girl just take off yo socks
Let me lick on yo feet
I'll rub yo body & watch you roll yo eyes to the ceiling
Won't you lay on down
Let my face be yo linen
C'mon and sho me yo ways

Check it out
I told yo Mama don't wait up
Don't check up on us
Don't call we handled it all I'm ready to bust
& I'm really hoping yo daughter can handle my lust
You done had yo chance now that land is handed to us
Pop's knows how it goes shewt any man does
Fine daughter like his can't afford to miss love
& I'm a give it to her sho nuff without a flub
Give it her like a fat man giving himself grub
You think we waited for nothing my bloods pumping
Needs go to where it's needed the most
Relieve something shewt certain parts of me resemble a mule
Stiff and stubborn it's like I'm Rosa Parks on the stool
(rrrgh)
We going all out hittin' the balls out
Coming deep from the soul Like a Lou Rawls shout
People next door screamin who let the dogs out
Man it's our honeymoon we here to knock the walls out
