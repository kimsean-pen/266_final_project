Hey man I'm cool to lean on
But I'm not your property
See I'm crushing down these problems
Cutting pain with poverty
I'm just tryin' to catch a free ride
From the temple to the tomb

I could really really really
Use a rich rich friend like you
I could really really really
Use a rich rich friend like you

Let me be your one-man army
Bumpin' pain for anarchy
I been slippin' through the cracks
Like I was clothed in Vaseline
Let me be your little sunshine
In all this gloom and doom

I could really really really
Use a rich rich friend like you
I could really really really
Use a rich rich friend like you

Crashin' on chardonnay and Adderall
Driving head on into the wonderwall
Every day holidays when daddy's gone
Livin' life like we're the only ones that know we're famous

From the Capetown coliseums
Cold disparity
Electric fences hummin' like a hive without a queen
We're all trying to catch a free ride
From the temple to the tomb

I could really really really
Use a rich rich friend like you
I could really really really
Use a rich rich friend like you

Crashin' on chardonnay and Adderall
Driving head on into the wonderwall
Every day holidays when daddy's gone
Livin' life like we're the only ones that know we're famous

Crashin' on chardonnay and Adderall
Driving head on into the wonderwall
Every day holidays when daddy's gone
Livin' life like we're the only ones that know we're famous

Crashin' on chardonnay and Adderall
Driving head on into the wonderwall
Every day holidays when daddy's gone
Livin' life like we're the only ones that know we're famous
