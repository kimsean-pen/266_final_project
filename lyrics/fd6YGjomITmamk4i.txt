Pray you don't know how this feels
I pray you don't go home alone
I pray you don't know
I pray you don't
I pray you don't know
I pray you don't

I pray your things are neatly packed
I pray a love that you had lost
Might take you back
But you're on your own now
You're on your own
You're on your own now
You're on your own

I pray that someone cares for you
This life and love I withdrew
And shake, but it won't shake your soul
There's grace when you wake
But it won't take control
And the archer he bends like the bow
Breathe in release and let go
But mostly I want you to know

When heaven opens wide
And lets you in
And your eyes were shining
And somehow I believe
You were beautiful again

The love that you need
Is the love that you find
Even though it's not me
Even though it's not mine [x2]

I pray these words from in your mouth
I pray forgiveness finds a way
To make it south
But you're on your own now
You're on your own
You're on your own now
You're on your own

But I pray you don't just because you can
If theres a mark then it isn't a brand
Brave as you face the unknown
There is grace when you wake
Find a way to atone
And the archer he bends like the bow
Breathe in, release and let go
But mostly I want you to know

When heaven opens wide
And lets you in
And your eyes were shining
And somehow I believe
You were beautiful again

The love that you need
Is the love that you find
Even though it's not me
Even though it's not mine [x2]
When heaven opens wide
And lets you in
And your eyes were shining
And somehow I believe
You were beautiful again

And you have let me down
And you have disappointed me [x3]

The love that you need
Is the love that you find
Even though it's not me
Even though it's not mine [x2]

I pray heaven opens wide
And lets you in
And your eyes were shining
And somehow I believe
You were beautiful again
