I can't find the line
I can't find the body's end
Am I the heat
Floating off this bag of skin?

Am I the brain inside
Or what gets made with it?
Are we all one?
Or are we separate?

When we disagree
I am your argument
When you've got problems
I am your circumstance

I'm your conscience
I'm your touch
I'm your culture
I'm your drug
I'm the snowstorm
The fire
I'm the flood

I shine the sun
I shine the sun
Nothing outside the
Infinite One
I shine the sun

I can't find the line
I can't find the body's end
Is it me in the maze?
Or am I the maze I'm in?

When you do evil
When you judge from above
When you want revenge
I'm your nature, your love

I shine the sun
I shine the sun
Nothing outside the
Infinite One
I shine the
I shine the
I shine the
I shine the

When we disagree
I am your argument
When you've got problems
I am your circumstance

I'm your conscience
I'm your touch
I'm your culture
I'm your drug
I'm the snowstorm
The fire
The flood

I shine the sun
I shine the sun
Nothing outside the
Infinite One
I shine the
I shine the
I shine the
I shine the
