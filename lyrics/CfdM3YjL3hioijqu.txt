Those who know
They don't let it go
They just give you one long glance
And you go, oh, oh, oh

Goes to show
How winds blow
The weather's fine
And I feel so, so, so

Birds of prey
With too much to say
Oh, what could be my destiny?
Another rainy day

Why? Ask why?
For by the by and by
All mysteries are just more
Needles in the camel's eye

Those who know
They don't let it go
They just give you one long glance
And you go, oh, oh, oh

Why? Ask why?
For by the by and by
All mysteries are just more
Needles in the camel's eye
