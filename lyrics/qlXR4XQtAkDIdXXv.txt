Wandering in darkness I can't help but feel I'm running out of time,
and I don't want to fail again.
Seems to me that I'm the last man standing here, but I'm still alone,
and there is no direction for me.
My idle hands hold on, can't hold on, no.

Give me your blessing ancient fire.
Give me the courage lift me higher.
Give me the strength that I desire.
Give me the knife.

Looking at the faceless aging faces all the dreams that dreamed to be,
so suddenly familiar.
Running out of options I have no one and there's no need to explain
your foolish optimism to me.
My idle hands hold on, can't hold on, no.

Give me your blessing ancient fire.
Give me the courage lift me higher.
Give me the strength that I desire.
Give me the power.

Give me your blessing ancient fire.
Give me the courage lift me higher.
Give me the strength that I desire.
Give me the power.
