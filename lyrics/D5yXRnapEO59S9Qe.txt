I live for you.
I die for you.
Do what you want me to.
I cry for you, my tears will show that i can't let you go.

It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet.
You still me want me don't you?
It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet.
Cause i can see through you.
It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet.
You still want me don't you?
It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet.

Don't let me down, don't make a sound.
Don't throw it all away.
Remember me so tenderly.
Don't let it slip away.

It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet.
You still me want me don't you?
It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet.
Cause i can see through you.
It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet.
You still want me don't you?
It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet.

It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet.
You still me want me don't you?
It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet.
Cause i can see through you.
It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet.
You still want me don't you?
It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet.
