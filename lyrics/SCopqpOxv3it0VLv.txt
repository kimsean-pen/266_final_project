Congradulations. Stop.
Wish I could be there. Stop.
Tell me something that I don't know
Is there anything left to know?
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
Accesory, accesory, accesory

We regret to inform. Stop.
Miss you dearly, signed sincerely. Stop.
Tell me something that I don't know
Is there anything left to know?
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
Accesory, accesory, accesory
To the time time time time

I've got this epic problem
This epic problem's not a problem for me
And inside, I know I'm broken
But I'm working as far as you can see
And outside, it's all production
It's all illusion, set scenery
I've got this epic problem
This epic problem's not a problem for me
