Come on, come on, these breaths grow thinner.
The length of words spent talking about what's wrong, how long, still gone, move on.
blinded by the better parts of new things to come.

Left hand in hand with life unsettled.
Begone from me an everlasting sigh sent skyward, marching on and on and on.
Marching ever onward to the beat of my lungs.

On and on and on and on,
wish I could sleep until the day is done.

Let's not contemplate what follows
it could be today or next year, we're goners.
Let me go.

Let me go on and on and on and on.

Let's not contemplate what follows
it could be today or next year, we're goners.
If you can't seem to help but feel the sorrow,
remember that yesterday once was tomorrow.
Let me go.
