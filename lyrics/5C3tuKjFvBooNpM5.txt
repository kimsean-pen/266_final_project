This is a song for anyone
With a broken heart
This is a song for anyone
Who cant get out of bed

I'll do anything
To be happy
Oh 'cause blue skies are calling
But I know that it's hard

This is the last song
That I write
While still in love with you

This is the last song
That I write
While you're even on my mind

'Cause its time to leave
Those feelings behind
Oh 'cause blue skies are calling
But I know that it's hard

I don't think that it's the end
But I know we can't keep going
I don't think that it's the end
But I know we can't keep going

But blue skies are calling
Oh yeah blue skies are calling
Oh blue skies are calling
But I know that it's hard
