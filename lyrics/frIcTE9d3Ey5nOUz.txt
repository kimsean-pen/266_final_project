But I'm drunk again
But I'm drunk again
I need help with myself
I need help with myself
But she's right here
So after a few more nights to talk to her
I decided to go a lake area days after the party
I honestly think I'm in love with this girl
I recorded a song for her
that's pretty much about the summer and how I was follow her?
I put it on a tape recorder but I didn't have the chance to give it to her
