Round 'n' round
Carousel
Has got you under it's spell
Moving so fast... but
Going nowhere

Up 'n' down
Ferris wheel
Tell me how does it feel
To be so high
Looking down here

Is it lonely
Lonely
Lonely

Did the clown
Make you smile
He was only your fool for a while
Now he's gone back home
And left you wandering there

Is it lonely
Lonely
Lonely
