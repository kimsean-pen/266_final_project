Light of my sun
light in this temple.

Light in my truth
lies in the darkness.

Teasing pureness
of your lies
soreness of a
delightful mission.
Burning up
inside your mind
you belong
to my possessions.

Cant you see that
I'm here inside of you?

Light - massive pain
Glide - passive tension

Light - show me how to
slide in this pleasure.

Teasing pureness
of your eyes.
Crawling into empty spaces.
You could lie and lie again
You belong to my possessions.

cant you see that
I'm here inside of you?

This is my harmony
I'm in your heart again.
This is the place to live
when I'm alone again.

This is my harmony - I'm here.
I lay again - this is the prayer to give.
I'm all alone again.
