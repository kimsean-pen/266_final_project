Uh oh (x8)

I think about you baby every night
Oh it feels so good it's got to be right
And darling I don't even know your name
Oh it's good, it's good, I like it that way

Close up, rewind, you're in, my mind
One touch, too far, eyes meet so sweet in the dark

Big Brother's watching me and I don't really mind
I like him watching me watch him watch life
There's nothing he can't see and not much he won't find
He likes me watching him watch me all night

I like the way you're messing with my head
Oh it feels so good I'm shaking in my bed
And baby don't you think I know your game
Oh it's good, it's good, I know you feel the same

Close up, rewind, you're in, my mind
One touch, too far, eyes meet so sweet in the dark

Big Brother's watching me and I don't really mind
I like him watching me watch him watch life
There's nothing he can't see and not much he won't find
He likes me watching him watch me all night

If I'm confused and dazed and it's a crazy day
I wanna know you care
And when I'm home at night and mister lonely bites
I wanna know you're there

Big Brother's watching me and I don't really mind
I like him watching me watch him watch life
There's nothing he can't see and not much he won't find
He likes me watching him watch me all night
