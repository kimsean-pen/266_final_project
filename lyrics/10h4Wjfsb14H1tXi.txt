Hey sugar

Saturday night in the dancing house I say (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Starving boys staring at my ass I say (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
You're the one I like
I wanna share my thoughts tonight
Big mama you're my kind
Gimme a part of your precious time

Hey you're the one I like
I wanna share your love tonight
I wanna smoke your special thing

Let's bang bang bang
Let's bang bang bang
Let's bang bang bang
Let's bang

You'd better do the dance
You'd better take that chance
You'd better move your butt
You gotta show me what you got

Come on, shake it man
Jump on the line
You gotta shake that ass
If you wanna have mine

This is the perfect fight
On a Saturday night
You wanna hang, wanna hang
So do the dance and
Bang bang bang bang bang

Do the dance mate and I lose cabeza
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I power my ass with the Travolta style
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I wanna get naughty and I wanna doubt
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
The boy bailando is the one I want
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! (Shake it, shake it, huh!)

Hey you're the one I like
I wanna share your love tonight
I wanna smoke your special thing

Let's bang bang bang
Let's bang bang bang
Let's bang bang bang
Let's bang

You'd better, you'd better, you'd better
You'd better, you'd better, you'd better
You'd better dance dance

You'd better dance!
Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang!

You'd better, you'd better, you'd better
You'd better dance!

Jump on the line
You gotta shake that ass
If you wanna have mine

On a Saturday night

Bang bang bang bang bang

You wanna hang out with the chimp
So bring your ass to the table!
You wanna hang, wanna hang
So do the dance and
Bang bang bang bang bang
