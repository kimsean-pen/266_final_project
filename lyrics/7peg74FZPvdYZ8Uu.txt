You hold it in your hands
And let it flow, this cruelty
Of youth as you fall again, alone
In the compromise of truth

It's in the eyes
I can tell, you'll always be danger
We had it tonight
Why do you leave it open?

And the stakes
Remain too high
For this silent mind
And the shake, the lonely itch
That course down my spine
To leave a love divine
Don't leave a love divine
It's a water tight excuse

It's in the eyes
I can tell, you'll always be danger
We had it tonight
Why do you always seek absolution?
It's in the eyes
I can tell you'll always be danger

How does the earth around your feet
Just slip away?
And the bandit that greets you in the night
With snake eyes
The most precious time

It's in the eyes
I can tell you'll always be danger
We had it tonight
Why do you always seek absolution?
It's in the eyes
I can tell you'll always be danger
