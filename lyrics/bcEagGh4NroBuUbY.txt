Being left soul-abandoned, facing south
As a new born one
Seeds o compassion, shall be found
The oracle's trance told mystical signs
Incarnation's quest
Leading towards the rising sun

To the lake of visions
For answers, they will seek
Staring peacefully
Omens through the waters
Amongst majestic peaks
Letters, clearly seen

Ah-Ka-Ma

Auspicious journey
Foreshadowed signs revealed
Guiding prophetically
Omens, to be answered
A young child, they will meet
Chosen, shall he be?

To the lake of visions
For answers, they will seek
Staring peacefully
Omens, to be answered
A young child, they will meet
Chosen, shall he be?
