I don't feel good... Just an ordinary day
I don't care much... about what you think

It all washes away in the end... Under skies so gray in the end (We're all)
Dead inside, can't deny what is real, the pain I feel.
Dead inside, can't deny always suffering, it's just my way.

I've seen enough... No more hurt today
All damage is done... No more life this way.

It all washes away in the end... Under skies so gray in the end (We're all)
Dead inside, can't deny what is real, the pain I feel.
Dead inside, can't deny always suffering, yeah.

Every single one... from every single way
All they do is drag me down, and I know it'll never change.
Every drop of blood... flows right down the drain
And though I spilt it all for you, you never appreciate, never appreciate (We're all)

Dead inside, can't deny what is real, the pain I feel.
Dead inside, can't deny always suffering, it's just my way.
