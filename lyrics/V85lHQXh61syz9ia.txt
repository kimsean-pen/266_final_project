(You-you need to go this is not safe ...)

I've crawled outside of my shell
I think I was born in a well
Nobody heard my cries for help, help
I came to create my own hell
And now you're all under my spell
You may even bring me to doubt
Secrets inside of myself

You are more than
Chests of gold
You become me
Like this love

I think there's a bug in my code
An evil presence in my soul
I ask it to make itself known
But rarely its form is shown

Met the day deader
He's carved into trees
Bruised reaching for the
Black around me

I must be bought in
But I fought down to not reach

Then a dark figure
Reaches out his clawed fingers
And says to me
You're my favourite tragedy
