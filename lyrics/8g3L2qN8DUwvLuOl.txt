Come with me to the green

Dear Friend,
I've might to pray to knew they
Our bodies go weak
I lead skin open and keep in silence
Again, again, again, again, again

There whole world is pulled you so sad
There whole world is pulled you so sad

Get out of your cave
Come with me to the green
Get out of your cave
Come with me to the green
Get out of your cave
Come with me to the green
Get out of your cave
Come with me to the green
Get out of your cave
Come with me to the green

Last been sight in November
Last been sight November
in November, in November,
in November, in November,
in November, in November,
in November, in November,

Confess the most on your knees
Confess the most on your knees
Confess the most on your knees
