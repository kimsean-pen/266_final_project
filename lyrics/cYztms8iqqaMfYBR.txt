O' my your fever's high,
I lay my hands upon you,
O' my haven't you heard,
The truth is untrue.

Now I'm breathing,
I could not breath until you did,
I'm one second after you,
Just a second after you.

Someone inside your room,
Who is it there behind you?
What does he want from you?

Sleeper, what did you see?
I close the window to the street,
Parent died and left their child,
Unattented for a while.

Sleeper's song will you listen to me sing?
The bird is here I can see the edge of his wing,
If you die now how can I then live on?
Don't give up you must live on.
