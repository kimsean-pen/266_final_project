(Fuck you man
How about that?
Fuck you

Sorry that I'm leaving this old place
What's left to say?
The kid became the dream

A legendary nightmare he has won
The sun has set
Every word he wrote he fucking meant

We came!
Crawling!
We came!
Crawling up from hell!

We can crawling up from hell
Demonic versions of ourselves
We came crawling up from hell
We are the nightmare
We are the nightmare
In this world

Nightmare!
This nightmare!

Decaying adolescent, human waste
Crawl from the grave
No voice left to scream

From the fire we all cheated death
Have no regrets
Skeletons and ghost we fought our best

We came!
Crawling up from hell!

We can crawling up from hell
Demonic versions of ourselves
We came crawling up from hell
We are the nightmare
We are the nightmare
In this world
