Sorry, it's just, people are complaining
Too bad!
You know, they want to know if you guys can maybe try tuning up again. Or...
No!
...just play on the beat and just do it right?
No! let's stop fooling around
and turn this band into a lean, mean, mom-jeans revenge machine! Yeah! Mom jeans!

what do you want me to say
it's never going away
'cause I'm stuck on you like the smell of cigarettes on your flower dress
I want you under my fingernails
I want you in my sleep and in my dreams
I wake up spooning my pillow
sweaty hands but please don't tell your friends
now I'm addicted to cigarettes
at first I didn't let myself inhale
but smoke got through and so did you
and now every burn hole smells like home

and I know it's killing me but that still won't stop me
'cause now we smell the same but you still kill me faster

I don't mind that you lie sometimes
because I lie too
guess I'm just like you
I don't mind that you lie sometimes
because I lie too
guess I'm just like you

I don't mind that you lie sometimes
because I lie too
guess I'm just like you
I don't mind that you lie sometimes
because I lie too
guess I'm just like you

I don't mind that you lie sometimes
because I lie too
guess I'm just like you
