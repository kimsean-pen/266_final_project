Stepping out to Angellucci's for my coffee beans
Checking out the movies and the magazines
Waitress she watches me crossing from the Barocco Bar
I'm getting a pickup for my steel guitar
I saw you walking out Shaftesbury Avenue
Excuse me talking I wanna marry you
This is seventh heaven street to me
Don't you seem so proud
You're just another angel in the crowd
And I'm walking in the wild west end
Walking in the wild west end
Walking with your wild best friend

Now my conductress on the number nineteen
She was a honey (she was a honey)
Pink toenails and hands all dirty with money
Greasy greasy greasy hair easy smile
She made me feel nineteen for a while
I went down to Chinatown
In the backroom it's a man's world
All the money go down
Duck inside the doorway duck to eat
Just saying oh
You and me we can't beat
Walking in the wild west end
Walking in the wild west end
Walking with your wild best friend

And a gogo dancing girl yes I saw her
The deejay he say here's Mandy for ya
I feel alright seeing her
Do that stuff
She's dancing high I move on by
The close ups can get rough
When you're walking in the wild west end
Walking walking walking in the wild west end
Walking with your wild best friend

Walking walking
