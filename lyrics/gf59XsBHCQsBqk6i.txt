When The Pick of Destiny was released it was a bomb
And all the critics said that the D was done
The sun had set and the chapter had closed
But one thing no one thought about was the D would rise again

Just like the phoenix
We'll fuckin' rise again
That's right, the phoenix
We'll rise again, y'all

'Cause the fiery heart of a champion cannot be quelched
By a failure or an embarrassment, no way no
And the critics all agreed, it was a stinky pile of chee
But that does not mean that our hearts are not strong

Just like the phoenix
We'll fuckin' rise again, y'all
That's right, the phoenix
We'll rise again

Sun shining, it's a hell of a day
Bright is back and it's headed your way
D's here, now we're puttin' on a show
We'll stink it up, then we will need a window

Out rockin', yeah we're rockin' again
Black Mamba is my personal friend
Phil Jackson is the master of zen
We'll pick you up, keep you over the weekend

It's the rise of the phoenix
It's the call of attack
And you'll know when you've seen us
The fuckin' D is back, y'all

Lovemakin' all the way to the top
Boots smokin', but I'm not gonna stop
Bossa Nova is a beautiful dance
Hot-blooded, that's lots of romance

It's the rise of the phoenix
And we ride with the pack
It's the magic between us
The fuckin' D is back

But what if it's true?
If Tenacious D has died, what will we do?
And what will we do
'bout all the fans who have the D tattoo?

They'll have them removed
They'll have to laser off the D tattoos
Tattoos
They'll have to laser off the D tattoo

Wait a minute Cage
- What's that you say?
You know it's not too late
- Yes, it is too late
We only need one hit
- Just imagine it
We could be the shit
- Too legit to quit
One hit
One hit
One hit
Yeah, we're hoping this is it
One hit
Top 10 hit
Top 40 hit
Top 1000 hit
I don't care, as long as we get there
We'll start anew
And you can get a new Tenacious D tattoo

You can get a new Tenacious D tat...
too
