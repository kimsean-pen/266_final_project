Aha, mmm, hmm
Gonna get along without you now
Aha, mmm, hmm
Gonna get along without you now

You told me I was the neatest thing
You even asked me to wear your ring
You ran around with every girl in town
You didn't even care if it got me down

Aha, aha, mmm, hmm, mmm, hmm
Gonna get along without you now
Aha, aha, mmm, hmm, mmm, hmm
Gonna get along without you now

Got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now
Gonna find somebody that's as twice as cute
'Cause I didn't like you anyhow

You told everybody that we were friends
But this is where our friendship ends
'Cause all of a sudden you'd change your tune
You haven't been around since way last June

Aha, aha, mmm, hmm, mmm, hmm
Gonna get along without you now
Aha, aha, mmm, hmm, mmm, hmm
Gonna get along without you now

So long, my honey, goodbye, my dear

Aha, aha, mmm, hmm, mmm, hmm
Gonna get along without you now
Aha, aha, mmm, hmm, mmm, hmm
Gonna get along without you now

You told me I was the neatest thing
You even asked me to wear your ring
You ran around with every girl in town
You didn't even care if it got me down

Aha, aha, mmm, hmm, mmm, hmm
Gonna get along without you now
Aha, aha, mmm, hmm, mmm, hmm
Gonna get along without you now

So long, my honey, goodbye, my dear
