I'm free to be
Whatever I, whatever I choose
And I'll sing the blues if I want
I'm free to say
Whatever I, whatever I like
If it's wrong or right it's alright
Always seems to me, you only see
What people want you to see
How long's it gonna be?
Before we get on the bus
And cause no fuss
Get a grip on yourself
It don't cost much
You're free to be
Whatever you, whatever you say
If it comes my way it's alright
You're free to be
Wherever you, wherever you please
You can shoot the breeze if you want
It always seems to me, you only see
What people want you to see
How long's it gonna be
Before we get on the bus
And cause no fuss
Get a grip on yourself
It don't cost much
I'm free to be
Whatever I, whatever I choose
And I'll sing the blues if I want

Here in my mind
You know you might find
Something that you
You thought you once knew
But now it's all gone
And you know it's no fun
Yeah I know it's no fun
Oh, I know it's no fun

I'm free to be
Whatever I, whatever I choose
And I'll sing the blues if I want
I'm free to be
Whatever I, whatever I choose
And I'll sing the blues if I want
Whatever you do
Whatever you say
Yeah, I know it's alright
Whatever you do
Whatever you say
Yeah, I know it's alright
