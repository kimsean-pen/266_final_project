Many words are spoken when there's nothing to say
The fall upon the ears of those who don't know the way
To read between the lines
That lead between the lines
That lead me to you

All that I ask you
Is show me how to follow you and I'll obey
Teach me how to reach you
I can't find my own way
Let me see the light
Let me be the light
