They will say that he loves you, he don't
From their bible they're controlled
His descent they expect in our life
They'll be waiting till they die
Disembark from their path of belief
It in turn will set you free
Cannot live with the fact that they're wrong
That there is no truth in god

Trick or betrayed
Their faith ends in pain
Rip up their bible before it's too late
Time we undo unity
For it is for fools
In this world we don't need

Trick or betrayed
I think you should know
They know it's true
That their book is a hoax
Join us to see through the light
Christ is a scheme and will ruin your life

Trick or betrayed

Why insist on the cross died for us
His infliction never was
They assume that his death brought them life
To be dead will change their minds
When you see what you feel is not real
Disapointment is revealed
Cannot live with the fact that they're wrong
There is no such thing as god

Trick or betrayed
Their faith ends in pain
Rip up their bible before it's too late
Time we undo unity
For it is for fools
In this world we don't need

Trick or betrayed
I think you should know
They know it's true
That their book is a hoax
Join us to see through the light
Christ is a scheme and will ruin your life
