Where is the world?
I saw in your eyes?
It lived through the night
Then whispered goodbye

The cuts on your skin
The red in my eyes
This winter inside
Is crushing me now

"I am alone, I am scorn
I can't remember to forget you
I just weather the storm"

The love that I had
It drowned in the tide
Stirring the waters
Where hearts lay bare

The cuts on your skin
The red in your eyes
Enfolding this shame
Into despair

Let me take the noose
From our necks and carry us home
Still so alive even after your die
Transcending with time

We're just two cripples
Who fail to belong
Yes we're just two cripples
But we need to hold on

From this flesh my spirit longs to break away
Did you ever feel this cosmic circustance
was never enough?

Wake me slowly if ever at all
Wake me slowly
Or watch me fall
Watch me fall

The life that I had
Is gone with the tide
Watch me fall
Another deception
I whisper goodbye
The cuts in my flesh
The red in your eyes
Watch me fall
These demons inside
They die with me now
