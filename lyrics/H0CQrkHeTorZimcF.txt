Wake up
Think fast
Three weeks have passed
We are changing
No sleep
No gas
No excuses will pass these lips
'Cause we're shaping up to be all you wish you could have been
To write the hits and to turn their heads
And to open eyes to a brand new season
A brand new season

So show me something we haven't heard yet
But I'm not convinced and your heartless songs won't stick
But I
I'll sing you something you won't forget
For the first time I know this is now who I am

Wake up
Think fast
Three weeks have passed these lips
'Cause we're shaping up to be all you wish you could have been
To write the hits and to turn heads
And to open eyes to a brand new season
A brand new season

So show me something we haven't heard yet
But I'm not convinced and your heartless songs won't stick
But I
I'll sing you something you won't forget
For the first time I know this is now who I am

You'll see what we mean
You'll notice when we're gone

So show me something we haven't heard yet
But I'm not convinced and your heartless songs won't stick
But I
I'll sing you something you won't forget
For the first time I know this is now who I am
