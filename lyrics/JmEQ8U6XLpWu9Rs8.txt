The time has come
For me to face who I have become
The looking glass stares back hard
Who are the one before me
This lost and lonely soul so frail and scarred

Give away to the pain of yesterday
We're all lost, scarred and broken anyway

Like the darkness conquers the night
Will a new dawn come to life (come to life)
Like the day gives into the night
Will the sunset cease the light (cease the light)
I hold my pledge to thee
Who darken all my dreams

The haunting past
Endures my persistence at long last
I gave my all for no greater cause
At the end it dawned on me
There was no need to even carry on

Give away to the pain of yesterday
We're all lost, scarred and broken anyway

Like the darkness conquers the night
Will a new dawn come to life (come to life)
Like the day gives into the night
Will the sunset cease the light (cease the light)
I hold my pledge to thee
Who darken all my dreams

Dying emotions and dreams
All led a drift on the stygian stream
Cursed down below and beneath
This river will seize and secrete
I drown in the currents
I'm embrace by the styx
A stifling burden
A total eclipse

Silence speaks louder than the knife
Timeless appears the void that wore me down
Right to the ground

Like the darkness conquers the night
Will a new dawn come to life (come to life)
Like the day gives into the night
Will the sunset cease the light (cease the light)
I hold my pledge to thee
Who darken all my dreams
