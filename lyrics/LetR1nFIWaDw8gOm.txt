Sing, Michael, sing-on the route of the 19 Bus
Hear them sayin'
How you get a rude and a reckless?
Don't you be so crude and a feckless
You been drinking brew for breakfast
Rudie can't fail

So we reply
I know that my life make you nervous
But I tell you that I can't live in service
Like the doctor who was born for a purpose
Rudie can't fail (okay)

I WENT TO THE MARKET TO REALISE MY SOUL
WHAT I NEED I JUST DON'T HAVE (OH NO)
FIRST THEY CURSE, THEN THEY PRESS ME TILL I HURT
WE SAY RUDIE CAN'T FAIL

Oh first you must cure your temper
Then you find a job in a paper
You need someone for a saviour
Rudie can't fail

We reply
Now we get a rude and a reckless
We been seen lookin' cool an' a speckless
We been drinking brew for breakfast
Rudie can't fail
I WENT TO THE MARKET TO RELISE MY SOUL
'CAUSE WHAT I NEED I JUST DON'T HAVE (HAVE)
FIRST THEY CURSE, THEN THEY PRESS ME TILL I HURT
RUDIE CAN'T FAIL
Okay!
So where you wanna go today?
Hey boss man!
You're looking pretty smart
With you chicken skin suit

You think you're pretty hot
In your pork pie hat
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail (aye aye)
