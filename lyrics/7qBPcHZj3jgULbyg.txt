Wait up for my call
Cause I want it all
I've chased for so long
My time has come

I don't say much
With poise or grace
I'll come of age
In this town on this day
The wrong song, the wrong place
To say this to your face

I'll come close, I'll come here

I'll come loud
And come clear
That look in your eyes
Says you're mine on this day
The wrong time, the wrong place
To say this to your face

But I want you when I need you
Every single night and day

Keep your cool
You hold the cards, you make the rules
And I want you when I need you
Every single night and day
The right time, the right place
To say this to your...

Cause I want you when I need you
Every single night and day
