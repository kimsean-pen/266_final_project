There's no prize for winning this race
No prize for winning this race
So what's the hurry in the first place?
No prize for winning this race
No prize for winning this race
So why you running off to first base?

It's supposed to hurt sometimes
And we lick these wounds together
Stand up, we're fine
It's ok to need sometimes
And I'll be your hand, your bender
Your middle finger

'Cause I want your real life moments
I wanna taste your pain
And I wanna see your war face on that day

You get no prize for winning this race
No prize for winning this race
So why you hurry in the first place?

We're supposed to bleed sometimes
And we make these scars together
They fade, tears dry
Bones will break and realign
There is your crutch you've leaned on
Now stretch out and move on

'Cause I want your real life moments
I wanna taste your pain
And I wanna see your war face on that day

At this rate, you'll get there before I do
And I'll be there before long
Slow down and let's walk it out together
Loser's strong
