Here strolls the blackened sky
With me, myself and I

Let's pretend well meet again
Pretend you knew me
Pretend you cared
Lets pretend we once kissed
With compassion
With heartfelt affection

Let's pretend well meet again
Let's just, lets just pretend
Pretend you're still... you're still my friend

Let's pretend well meet again
Pretend you knew me
Pretend you cared
Let's pretend we once kissed
With compassion
