Ridin' roads
Ridin' roads
Uh, yeah
This town ain't got no nightclub
We don't need the neon lights
Girl, I got that '87 gassed up
30 early out there in your drive
Got you a Bullet and koozie
Keep it ice cold
You take a sip 'fore we get gone
Lookin' at you with your hand
Out the window
I'm turnin' right while you're
Turnin' me on, yeah
Ridin' roads that don't nobody go down
A little trip through the country side
These 38s makin' the world go 'round
I hit a curb just to make you slide
Only light is the flashing yellow
Only thing that I want is your kiss
I'm lovin' nothin' to do with you, baby
Just ridin' roads on a night like this
Ridin' roads
Out there where the moon hits the water
Out there where your lips hit mine
I don't know where we are
'Cause somebody stole the street signs
I'ma take my sweet time, yeah
'Cause I could go on forever
With you there ridin' shotgun, yeah
All our friends are probably
Makin' plans, baby
Yeah, but we already got one
We'll be ridin' roads that
Don't nobody go down
A little trip through the country side
These 38s makin' the world go 'round
I hit a curb just to make you slide
Only light is the flashing yellow
Only thing that I want is your kiss
I'm lovin' nothin' to do with you, baby
Just ridin' roads on a night like this
Just ridin' roads on a night like this
Ridin' roads
I got one hand on the wheel
And I got the other tryna
Cross the line, line, line
Yeah, the way you make feel
I wanna keep it rollin'
'Til the sun rise, rise, rise
Ridin' roads that don't nobody go down
A little trip through the country side
These 38s makin' the world go 'round
I hit a curb just to make you slide
Only light is the flashing yellow
Only thing that I want is your kiss
I'm lovin' nothin' to do with you, baby
Just ridin' roads on a night like this
Just ridin' roads on a night like this
