Cindy smiles in overcoats
She says, "Please stay a while
Like ice cream floats and dreams
And I will fill your heart with boats and bells
And beams and candy-appled everythings
Bells and beams and candy-appled everythings"
Cindy skips my trampoline
With toys and horns and bouncing things
And even the most silent must sing a song of love
Yes, even the silent they must sing a song of love
Oh, oh

Unhappy girl, she's spinning
Through strings in her curls
And it's only the beginning
Of a trip around the world
Cindy, won't you smile?
Cindy, won't you sleep a while?
I feel I'm just a child
Sinking down one hundred million miles
Oh, oh
