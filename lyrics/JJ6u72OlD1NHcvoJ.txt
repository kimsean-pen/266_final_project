Happy in this haze of mine, this daze ain't leaving
I can roll the dice, the night is breathing
Misery is magical if you are bleeding
Dreamers still dream without sleeping

And I want you to know, oh
Oh I got electrified
By your side
And I want you to know, oh
Oh I got electrified
By your side

Take me off the nightingale, my heart is jumping
Girls and novacane, my skin is popping
Floating down the streets of gold just like heaven
Now I'm feeling so alive, feeling something

And I want you to know, oh
Oh I got electrified
By your side
And I want you to know, oh
Oh I got electrified
By your side

The lowest mountain
The sky is chanting
The lights are singing
They go, oh, oh, oh
The lowest mountain
The sky is chanting
The lights are singing
They go, oh, oh, oh

And I want you to know, oh
Oh I got electrified
By your side
And I want you to know, oh
Oh I got electrified
By your side
And I want you to know, oh
