You got your trouble
I got my own
Look how it takes to
The warmth of your home
You can't wait you're
All ready to go
Out in the cold wind
Out in the snow

Cards on the table
Cards in your hand
Some people take more
I'm gonna stand
The beat edge of
The diamond queen
Just slipped out
From your shirt sleeve

Waiting a long time
Possibly still
For what few find
Most never will
Waiting to find
What sets you free
Until then,
What needs must be

What more
Yeah what more
They ask is there
And I tell myself
No need to care

Waiting a long time
Possibly still
For what few find
Most never will
Waiting to find
What sets you free
Until then,
What needs must be.
