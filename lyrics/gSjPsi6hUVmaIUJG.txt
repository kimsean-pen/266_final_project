If this was my last song
Would you know that it's for us?
Would you recognize the words I'm gonna sing?
Would you ever let it stop?

If this was my last song
Would you know that it's for you?
The same as every other I wrote before
Would you hear every word as true?

If you got somethin' to tell me, then tell me
'Cause I'm telling you we're running, we're running out of time

If this was my last song
Before I fall asleep
Before they lay me down in the bed that we made
Before it's history
There's a thousand words to say
But only three to keep
The details wash away on the pavement like the rain
Now I know what's left to say
If this was my last song...

I'd apologise for being me
The wrinkles printed on your face
That everytime you ride a wave out on the sea
You want to feel me underneath

If you got somethin' to tell me, then tell me
I'm telling you we're running, we're running out of time

If this was my last song
Before I fall asleep
Before they lay me down in the bed that we made
Before it's history
There's a thousand words to say
But only three to keep
The details wash away on the pavement like the rain
Now I know what's left to say

If you got something to tell me, then tell me
It feels like we're just running, we're running, we're running
Oh, so if you've got something to tell me, tell me
We're running out of time

'Cause this is my last song
Before I fall asleep
Before they lay me down in the bed that we made
Before it's history
There's a thousand words to say
But only three to keep
The details wash away on the pavement like the rain
Now I know what's left to say

'Cause this is my last song
'Cause this is my last song
