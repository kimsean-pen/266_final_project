Slow down, you can't catch me
There's so many things that I wanna see
The first thing is the way that you love me
I tried to show it to you
In the things I do for you
Thinking that you will love me
The way that I love you

There's another way
To get the things you want from me
Things you need from me
There's another way, mmh, mmh

I'm the producer
Just give me a love song
Give me your heartbeat
I'll make it better
I'm a natural lover
Just give me some attention
I don't have to mention

And I can give it back to you, yeah
Bigger than you gave it to me
Baby please, I can make you complete
Like a house to a home
(?)
I can make it better
I can make it better
I can make it better

I like how you hold me
You're pulling me closer
And that's how you show me
Feel the same way too
Then act like you know me
'Cause I know we
Can take this to another level

There's another way
To get the things you want from me
Things you need from me
There's another way, mmh, mmh

I'm the producer
Just give me a love song
Give me your heartbeat
I'll make it better
I'm a natural lover
Just give me some attention
I don't have to mention

And I can give it back to you, yeah
Bigger than you gave it to me
Baby please, I can make you complete
Like a house to a home
(?)
I can make it.

Baby you walk in the truth
But it all depends on you
I know in my heart that it's true
I believe in you
You

Give it back to you, yeah
Bigger than you gave it to me
Baby please, I can make you complete
Like a house to a home
(?)
I can make it better
Bigger than you gave it to me
Baby please, I can make you complete
Like a house to a home
(?)
I can make it better
