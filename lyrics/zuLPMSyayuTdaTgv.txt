well i'm feeling like i'm wheeling
i ripped and clattered through the door
and i see that i'm surrounded
i put the pedal to the floor
i don't want no demons now
i don't care what they are
i just wanna
get back in my car
that's what i say
seeming like i'm reeling
i'm feeling tattered to the bone
and i need your arms around me
you won't pick up the phone
