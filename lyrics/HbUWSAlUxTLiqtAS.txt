Another party with the same kids
Another night with the same drinks
I need to find myself a new chick
I need to kiss a set of new lips

She's got to be something new to me
A fresh face, someone new to please
So come on, come on girl, just you and me
Oh come on girl, just you and me

This kind of girl makes it rough (makin' it rough)
Holding our breath while we touch

She won't kiss and tell
But this isn't hell
She got that name, it all seems like a game
How she moves so well
I won't call this hell
If I had to guess
I'd say we have a mess you could sell

And how am I supposed to think
With her hands all over me
Telling me the right things
Ever so distracting

She's got to be something new to me
Loose ends but no sight of strings
So come on, come on, girl, just you and me
Come on, girl, just you and me

This kind of girl makes it rough (makin' it rough)
Holding our breath while we touch

She won't kiss and tell
But this isn't hell
She got that name, it all seems like a game
How she moves so well
I won't call this hell
But if I had to guess
I'd say we have a mess you could sell

She's makin' it harder
Harder to breathe
I'm gettin' weaker
But still pullin' the strings

The lights are all off
There's no one around
We've both lost our minds
They're nowhere to be found
It's gettin' hot
I'm not sayin' this is hell
But I swear
This girl's a mess you could sell
She won't kiss and tell
But this isn't hell
She got that name, it all seems like a game
How she moves so well
I won't call this hell
But if I had to guess
I'd say we've got a mess you could sell
