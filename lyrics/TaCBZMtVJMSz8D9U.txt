Pull me from the gallows
Pull me from the gallows
Of this fiber-optic nation

I cannot compute why
Why we celebrate this mediocrity

Just let me download my
My latest update right now
Just give me access to
To my latest opinion
Now, now, give it now now
Give it now

Unplug me from this fantasy
My eyes have seen the sun
Have we all become voyeurs?
Covered by this digital veil

Direct my mind
Just keep me occupied
Don't let me find
Something that's worth my time
Direct my mind

We like to think that we
That we are more connected
But the truth is that we've
Never been more divided
It's just too awkward
I need my digital veil

Unplug me from this fantasy
My eyes have seen the sun
Have we all become voyeurs?
Covered by this digital veil

Direct my mind
Just keep me occupied
Don't let me find
Something that's worth my time

Blow the lid off your hard drive
And even if I can't comprehend
My place in this world

Pull me from the gallows
Pull me from the gallows
Pull me from the gallows
Of this fiber-optic nation

Pull me from the gallows
Of this fiber-optic nation
Pull me from the gallows
Of this fiber-optic nation
Pull me from the gallows
Of this fiber-optic nation
Pull me from the gallows
Of this fiber-optic nation
