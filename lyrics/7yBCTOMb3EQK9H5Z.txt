I think about it all the time
and it cuts like a knife
?
when it fell between her eyes
and her eyes they will shine
like an ember in the sky
? don't smile
we'll set the world on fire

Such a sweet sweet girl
like a popsicle
and as blue as the sea
I lost you tragically

It is such a drag to be? in?
I'll never feel that love again
and it feels like the world will end
Sweet girl
