We all come from the belly bottom, belly bottom
We all come from the belly bottom, belly bottom
We all come from the belly bottom, belly bottom
We all come from the same same atom atom

We all start from the bottom, the very bottom
We all start from the very bottom, very bottom
We all start from the bottom, the very bottom
We all start from the same very bottom bottom
We all come for butter, bread and butter
We all come for the bread and butter, bread and butter
We all come for butter, bread and butter
We all come for the same bread and butter butter

They, they keep making us live for daydreams
They feed us a daydream
And we, we need something real
We can't eat a daydream.
