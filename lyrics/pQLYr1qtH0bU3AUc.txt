Total cessation, erased from foundations
Burn everything I know in hopes that something better grows
Prescriptions repeat, accepted defeat
Another crutch to add to my story
Find strength of mind, withered demons pushed aside
A new chapter overnight cause when the fuck else?
My only trick, finding hope in convictions
So one day when this ends I can say I'd relive it all

[Pre-
The easy way out never led me anywhere
And I, I always end up way too deep inside my head


The stagnant water that fills Tring Quarry
Was the lowest that I've ever seen it today
Stuck with the feeling that life only plays
Its significant songs when I'm feeling grey

[Post-
Frustrated, an understatement


Forgetting memories, parts of me
Thoughts of how it used to be
Bleeding contentment we come undone one by one
I was secure, so sure of myself
But I've been down this road before
Its quit, relapse forevermore
Can I say I'd relive it all?

[Pre-
The easy way out never led me anywhere
But I, I always end up way too deep inside my head
(All sewn up but not finished yet)


The stagnant water that fills Tring Quarry
Was the lowest that I've ever seen it today
Stuck with the feeling that life only plays
Its significant songs when I'm feeling grey


The stagnant water that fills Tring Quarry
Was the lowest that I've ever seen it today
I'm stuck with the feeling that life only plays
Its significant songs when I'm feeling grey


I swear I don't go around looking for the negative
Back trace my steps
Come home to my friends and a sedative
Frustrated, an understatement
