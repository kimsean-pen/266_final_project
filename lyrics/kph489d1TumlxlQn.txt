Oh, it's Fall now and it's cold
Went to the mountains and forgot my coat
I feel stupid in my shorts
I'm gonna freeze up here alone
Then, you called me
Then, you thawed me
I talked to Seth the other day
He said Japan was going great
I hope I see him on holiday
On holiday
Best friend, this is terrible
You don't know it's inevitable
I hope you come back
I hope he comes back
Oh, it's Fall and you're so cold
And, I just really want to go home
I just really need to be alone
Best friend, this is terrible
You don't know it's inevitable
I hope you come back
I hope he comes back
I just really want to go home
I just really need to be alone
I hope you come back
