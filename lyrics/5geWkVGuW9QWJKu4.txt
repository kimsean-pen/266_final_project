I don't like to live alone
Out on the avenue
I can't go back to being straight
I've seen the gutter view

Is it day or night?
Porcupine kiss, novacaine lips
Is it day or night?
White flowers weep
In their warm dust sleep
And its dog eat dog tonight

Back door to insanity
Was ripped from their throats
Street wise hustlers and six string masters
Look cold in their over coats

Is it day or night?
Porcupine kiss, novacaine lips
Is it day or night?
White flowers weep
In their warm dust sleep
And its dog eat dog tonight
