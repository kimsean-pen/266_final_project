The fox is dead in the garden
The hedges are on fire in the country lanes
And all I wanna do is get out of the rain
An autumn day, an autumn day
My daughter's asleep in the garden
The leaves are on fire in the country lanes
And all I wanna do is get out in the rain
An autumn day, an autumn day

I'm done with the world
And it's done with me
All I wanna do is get up and leave
Sun falls into the garden
I'm on my knees
