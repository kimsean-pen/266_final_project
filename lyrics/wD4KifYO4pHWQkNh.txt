I, am thinking
The way, the way
It's so natural

I, never really wonder, anything else goes
Never really wonder, anything else goes

I get up and wasn't right
Think it's hard to find it all around
It's hard, so you feel down
Maybe next time, be the last time
When you drop down to die
All rights wrong until it feels right

I, never really wonder, anything else goes
Never really wonder, anything else goes

I get up and wasn't right
Think it's hard to find it all around
It's hard, so you feel down
Anything else goes
I get up and wasn't
Think it's hard to find it all around
It's hard, so you feel down
