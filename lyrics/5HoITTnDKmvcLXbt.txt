I am the big broom who cleans up your act
A huge wall at the gate, dressed in black
It got the shiny head, V on the chest
And if you can't be clean this is what you get

Go hang your coat, or get the fuck out
And when I take you out, I'll take you out loudly
Eternal frown on the face and bored to death
Well if I get the call, you know what you get

I say yeah
Take out the trash

I am the king of Down Town
I am the king of Down Town
I am the king of Down Town
I am the king of Down Town
Down, down, down, down, Down Town

I tell you what, you won't get in
But it's the tennis shoes, not the color of your skin
These are the rules only I can bend
The Judge is here

On my feet, the rest of the night
While you all dance, I wait for a fight
Eternal frown on the face and bored to death
Well if I get the call, you know what you get

I say yeah
Take out the trash

I am the king of Down Town
I am the king of Down Town
I am the king of Down Town
I am the king of Down Town
Down, down, down, down, Down Town
