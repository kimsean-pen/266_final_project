I hate the way you smoke cigarettes when you're drunk
But you always remember to call me
And I hate the way you say that you're right when you're wrong
But you always come back home to love me, oh

And now you're going out of focus
And I'm losing you, I know, ohh
Cause I don't know how to forget
All the ways I hurt you so, ohh

And it's my fault if we go down
But I'm taking you with me
Yeah I'm taking you with me
And it's my fault if we go down
But I'm taking you with me
Yeah I'm taking you with me, yeah

I hate the way you speak from your heart when you're drunk
But you can't talk when you're sober
And I hate the way I'm standing you up when you want
When you want me to come over

And now you're going out of focus
And I'm losing you, I know, ohh
Cause I don't know how to forget
All the ways I hurt you so, ohh

And it's my fault if we go down
But I'm taking you with me
Yeah I'm taking you with me
And it's my fault if we go down
But I'm taking you with me
Yeah I'm taking you with me, yeah

Losing you, I know, I know, oh, losing you
Losing you, I know, I know, oh, losing you
Losing you, I know, I know, oh, losing you
Losing you, I know, I know, oh, losing you

And now you're going out of focus
And I'm losing you, I know, mmm
Cause I don't know how to forget
All the ways I hurt you so
