The last drop has gone
What have ı done?
I couldn't resist
So hard to exist
I've paid my bill
I've made another kill
No more me
Nothing but defeat

Coldness has dressed me
I've lost my will to live
Fear in my dreams
Controlled my inner self
All that ı felt
Sense of the ignorance
True or a dream
I felt so vulnerable

It was so cold
I saw the unseen
Or a dream

My blood ran cold
It shook my bones
Blood ran cold
Blood ran cold
Blood ran cold

I was seduced
Sweat came out of my face
I could not sleep
Or could not be awake
Demons in me
Told me to join their league
Down on my knees
I prayed the final sleep

I felt so cold
I saw the unseen
Or a dream

My blood ran cold
It shook my bones
Blood ran cold
Blood ran cold
Blood ran cold
