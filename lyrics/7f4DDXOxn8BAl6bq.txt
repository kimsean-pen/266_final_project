Search for my subconscious
Lead me into myself
A need to discover the dark
A will to enter these gates
Oh, This temptation
to end this empty life
In my dreams I saw my real side
A journey through forever
my visions oh so bright
Watching eternity open
as I turn out lifes light
Oh, this temptation
to leave this earthly shell
Deep inside, the toll of deaths bell

In the cold winds of nowhere

With a sigh I pass away
Falling, into harmonic sleep
Then Ill find my prophecies wasnt lies
Falling, into the abyssI come...

I... I am dying...
Death... Does heal me...

In the cold winds of nowhere
