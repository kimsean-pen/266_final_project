hard times we didn't need them
now you lean on someone better than
better than me
i suppose
better than me
what i gave ya
it didn't matter
when i held ya
you were a cold hard stone
but how does it feel to be alone
how does it feel
darling, i remember,
the way we used to beg
on those first nights
but now they make you sad
but believe me, darling
our life ain't that bad

shadows
move aside then
keep it
when the night ends
how does it feel to be alone
how does it feel
cause darling
i remember
the way we used to beg
on those first nights
but now they make you sad
but believe me darling
our life ain't that bad

i remember you talking to me
on those late nights
something i saw beneath you
but darling
i remember
the way we used to beg
on those first nights
now they make you sad
but believe me darling
your life
your life ain't that bad
darling, baby
if nothing makes it easier
you better go
you better go
but the light stays with me
