We are faster, faster than pain
We are a nerve ending without a brain
We have evolved, we have no feeling at all
It is a brave new world

Raise a glass in salutation
We drink to our annihilation
Was and will just make me ill
It is a brave new world

And we are faster than pain
We are dogs without a name
We are marching soldiers off to claim
The brave, brave, brave new world

I wanna dream it all away
I take a sober holiday
I take a gram and I only am
It is a brave new world

Raise a glass in salutation
We drink to our annihilation
Was and will just make me ill
It is a brave new world

And we are faster than pain
We are numbers in a chain
We are marching soldiers off to claim
The brave, brave, brave new world

And we are faster than pain
We are numbers in a chain
We are marching soldiers off to claim
The brave, brave, brave new world, world, world
