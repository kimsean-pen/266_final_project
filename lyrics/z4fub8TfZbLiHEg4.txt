It's been a while since I thought about you
But I'm sure you think about me all the time
Nothin' has changed from the
Bedroom to the pain except
You're the one who's sleepin' there tonight
While he was flyin' you to
Vegas and all our favorite places
Always runnin' 'round with each other
He was sayin' that he missed me
And damn girl you look pretty
I don't think you'd like how he was lookin' at me

He was sayin' you were casually datin'
When we ran into each other maybe once or twice
Said if he kissed me that it wouldn't be cheatin'
You can run with it, do with it what ever you like
It's just an fyi
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh it's just an fyi
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh

Don't get me wrong I don't want him anymore
But if you're gonna flaunt it guess you had it comin'
Stepped into my place, rubbed it in my face
You can't expect me to sit back and bite my tongue
Oh darlin', I don't got a motive
I thought you should know this
You're not the only one on his mind

He was sayin' you were casually datin'
When we ran into each other maybe once or twice
Said if he kissed me that it wouldn't be cheatin'
You can run with it, do with it what ever you like
It's just an fyi
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh it's just an fyi
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh

Sorry, I'm not sorry
It's not my problem anymore
Oh
He was sayin' you were casually datin'
When we ran into each other maybe once or twice
Said if he kissed me that it wouldn't be cheatin'
You can run with it, do with it what ever you like
It's just an fyi
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh it's just an fyi
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh yeah
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
It's just an fyi
