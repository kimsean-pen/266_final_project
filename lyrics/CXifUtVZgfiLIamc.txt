Can you feel it crush you does it seem to bring the worst in you out
There's no running away from these things that hold you down
Do they complicate you because they make you feel like this
Of all the colors that you've shined this is surely not your best
But you should know these colors that you're shining are

Surely not the best colors that you shine
Surely not the best colors that you shine

I know you feel alone yeah and no one else can figure you out
But don't you ever turn away from the ones that help you down
Well they'd love to save you don't you know they love to see you smile
But these colors that you've shined are surely not your style
But you should know these colors that you're shining are

Surely not the best colors that you shine
Surely not the best colors that you shine

I know you're feeling like you're lost
But you should know these colors that you're shining are
I know you're feeling like you're lost
You feel you've drifted way too far
Did you know these colors that you're shining are

Surely not the best colors that you shine
Surely not the best colors that you shine
Surely not the best colors that you shine
(I know you're feeling like you're lost but you should know
These colors that you're shining are)
Surely not the best
(I know you're feeling like you're lost you feel you've drifted way to far,
Did you know these colors that you're shining are
