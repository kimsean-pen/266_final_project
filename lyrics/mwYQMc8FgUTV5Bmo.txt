The star of twilight and the star of dusk
Manifest thy powers above
Of war and chaos but still of lust
Now searching for the great below
She will descend and she will rise
Like the evening and morning star
But what gives life must surely die
To make a journey this far

Ruler of the great land - Ereshkigal
Open now the great below - Irkalia

Stripped by powers one by one
As she's passing through the gates
Royal garments left behind
Descending to her fate
Guide her way deep down inside
Lead her all the way
For the dead a sacrifice
Forever she must stay

Open the gates - Queen
Open the halls - Of
Powers arise - The
Ascend from thy thralls - Dead
All doors unlocked, now bare she stands
Sweat glimmers on her skin
But life leaves and she lifts her hands
To curse her sister's grin
The look of death and the speech of anger
Seven ones to judge her fate
The empress now drained of power
A corpse to be hanged inside their gates

By the walls of grief a Sumerian cry
To fulfill the cursed one's wish
Bring the dead back to the sky
Free the soul bewitched
Go as ghosts, go as wind
Make your way below
Seen by none, unlit and dim
Bring her light back below

Ruler of the great land - Ereshkigal
Open now the great below - Irkalia

Open the gates - Queen
Open the halls - Of
Powers arise - The
Ascend from thy thralls - Dead
