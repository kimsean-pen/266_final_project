Adorned, in the skin of the serpent
Reborn, as the malevolent servant
Adorned, in the skin of the serpent
Reborn, as the malevolent servant

Feast on your people
The beast in his steeple
The coward with the crown
Pulls his bones from the ground
To pick his teeth
It never sleeps

Modern lobotomy
Chained to the chair
Dribbling and unaware
The floor is slowly sinking

Modern dichotomy
Dystopian heir
All hail the king of despair
You fucking sow what he is reaping

Feast on your people
The beast in his steeple

The coward with the crown
Pulls his bones from the ground
To pick his teeth
It never sleeps

Adorned, in the skin of the serpent
Reborn, as the malevolent servant
Adorned, in the skin of the serpent
Reborn, as the malevolent servant

Paralyzed
The snake that devours its brother
Suicide
The sickness of life absorbed by another

Death is destiny
Inescapable End

Inescapable End
