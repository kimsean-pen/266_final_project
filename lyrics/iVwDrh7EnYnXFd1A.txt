This sign, this sign is making them flow
Just breathe, just breathe and they'll lower the barricade
It's new, it's new till you leave it alone
I am only scared that I am alone

It's not a matter of a fact (it's an illusion),
Things are said to your back (sounds stupid),
It's just a figure of speech seen through your eyes
It's just trying to keep you to relax, (it's just nothing)
This isn't good for your head, do something
It's just a light in the sea trying to survive

I know, I know you're running alone
Who cares, who cares it's all coming back to me
We'll wait, we'll wait for this to become
I am only scared that I'll seek it endlessly
