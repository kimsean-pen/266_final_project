You get what you pay for
Unless you take a little more
Whats the delay for?
Ain't nothin' but a thunder storm
Found a new angle
But you and me will start a war
Or you'll get what you paid for
And thats all
Take what you can carry Joseph and Mary
They're out of town tonight

Well you get what you pay for
The sound of things, on silver screens
The media, celebrities
Whats the delay for?
Take what you want, not what you need
Just take and take and take take take
Take what you can carry Joseph and Mary
They're out of town tonight

My children will be shining, covered in diamonds
If you see me don't put up a fight
Or you'll get what you paid for
Yeah you'll get what you paid for
Take what you can carry Joseph and Mary
They're out of town tonight

My children will be shining, covered in diamonds
(You'd better hope you don't see me)
So take what you can carry Joseph and Mary
They're out of town tonight

My children will be shining, covered in diamonds
If you see me don't put up a fight

Or you'll get what you paid for
Yeah you'll get what you paid for
