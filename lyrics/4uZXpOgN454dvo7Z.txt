There's something acting on this body
Something goes in when nothing comes out
And someone's acting on this information
But nothing's registered from this location
From this site that I sense that I am, in asking
What is this burning in my eyes?
I wanted a language of my own
My lips were sucked empty and I mouthed the lines
Of this crowd that surrounds me
Punctured and parceled i fold my hand
To this site that I sense that I am in asking
What is this burning in my eyes?
