Like a cold day in August
I was not prepared for this
You'd think that nobody noticed
The way that you still care about it

By all the people we need to love and hate
Everybody makes the same mistakes
Divided by these walls
Together we are lost

But we are the same blood
All of us, we are, we are
While half of us were lost
The other half forgot

We are the same blood
We are the same blood
We are the same

You remind me of August
The way that I still care about
All the things that you promised
When I was still around
Pick you up and drive you down

We are the same blood
All of us, we are, we are
While half of us were lost
The other half forgot

We are the same blood
We are the same blood
We are the same blood
We are the same... oh!

Oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh, oh!

We are the same blood
All of us, we are, we are
We are the same blood
All of us, we are, we are
We are the same blood

Half of us are lost (yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
The other half forgot

We are the same blood
We are the same blood
We are the same blood
We are the same blood

Hey, hey, hey!
