Golly Sandra!
you've grown up really crazy...
have I been too denying of you?

Golly Sandra!
you've grown up so crazy...
have I been too untrusting?

to take me down to the bridge
where you know I will always love you
and I'll go without stopping

oh you are my star
and that's not really far away

Golly Sandra!
you've grown up really crazy...
have I been to denying of you,
to take me down to the bridge
where you know that I always loved you?
and I'll go without stopping

oh you are my star
that's not really far away

well I guess I have should have been around to sing you to sleep
you look so beautiful...
it hurts me slightly

oh you are my star
and that's not really far away away

oh you know i've tried so hard ...
I love you
