You know who it is
Oh boy, oh boy
I'm not your substitute lover (said I'm not), oh no
Said boy, oh boy, I'm not your substitute lover, oh no

I know it would have been nice if I coulda had your body
Knowing that everybody ain't been with you (ain't been with you)
But you told me lies, you made me give my heart away
But now I know the games you play
So I'm through with you (so I'm through with you)

Listen boy, oh boy, oh boy
I'm not your substitute lover, oh no
Said boy, oh boy, I'm not your substitute lover, oh no

You know there's gonna be a fight
If these chicks keep calling you at night
I seen that text you're tryin' to hide, see I know the truth
Must be outta your mind, you thought you'd never see the day
You thought I'd let a player play, but I'ma upgrade you

Listen boy, oh boy, oh boy
I'm not your substitute lover, oh no
Said boy, oh boy, I'm not your substitute lover, oh no

See, there's not much you can say
He said he's done changed and I finished today
'Cause I can't do it no more, I won't be there when you call
So you besta move on (move on)
'Cause I couldnt be your, your substitute no more

Listen, I said you can't call my name
Like I'm going out of fashion
And turn around and act like nothin' ain't happen
Like no, I'm not as cracking
Only when you need a chick
Only when you think about this hotness you get the itch
That's when you get the itch
Baby let me be your bitch
Boy who you think it is
Bad girl not tek this
Acting like a little boy
Play me like a decoy
You need to grow a couple boy
'Cause you ain't got nuttin' boy

Said boy, oh boy, I'm not your substitute lover, oh no
Said boy, oh boy, I'm not your substitute lover, oh no
Oh boy, oh boy, I'm not your substitute lover, oh no
Said boy, oh boy, I'm not your substitute lover, oh no
