Uprising
Upheaval
Ticking with the time
A greater of realities
Of equality
Better to be
A way better to be
No constant state of crisis
True chaos is a belief
Of true order

For once no frontiers
For some just frontiers

To choose is to see
Set the darkness on fire
The greates of realities
Is here!
Better to feel
A way better feeling
In a midst of crisis
True order lives with chaos
