Sorry seems to be the hardest word
What I got to do to make you love me?
What I got to do to make you care?
What do I do when lightning strikes me?
And I wake to find that you're not there

What I got to do to make you want me?
What I got to do to be heard?
What do I say when it's all over babe?
Sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad, so sad, it's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's so sad so sad, why can't we talk it over?
Oh, it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word

What I do to make you want me?
What I got to do to be heard?
What do I say when it's all over?
Sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad, so sad, it's a sad sad situation
And it's gotten more and more absurd
It's sad, so sad, why can't we talk it over?
Oh it seems to me
Sorry seems to be the hardest word

Yeah. Sorry

What I got to do to make you love me?
What I got to do to be heard?
What do I do when lightning strikes me?
What have I got to do?
What have I got to do?
When sorry seems to be the hardest word.
