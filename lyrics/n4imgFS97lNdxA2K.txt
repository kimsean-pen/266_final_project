love, it's a special day.
we should celebrate
and appreciate
that you and me found something pretty neat

and I know some say this day is arbitrary
but it's a good excuse to put our love to use
baby I know what to do, baby I will love you
I'll love you, I'll love you.
love, I don't need those things
I don't need no ring

I don't need anything
but you with me, cause in your company
I feel happy oh so happy and complete
and it's a good excuse to put our love to use
baby I know what to do, baby I will love you

I'll love you, I'll love you.
yeah it's a good excuse to put our love to use
baby I know what to do, baby I will love you
I'll love you, I'll love you.
so won't you be my honey bee
giving me kisses all the time

be mine, be my valentine
so won't you be my honey bee
giving sweet kisses all the time
be mine, be my valentine
