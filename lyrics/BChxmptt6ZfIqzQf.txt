Much too long I've been a prisoner here
The hour has come to break out
Shackled and chained almost goin' insane
It's better to live on the run
Set me free, set me free
Send me a sign, wanna leave it all behind
I'll be leaving the hands of doom
Rearrange the master plan, take the future in my hands
To be free and not trapped anymore
Ride the sky, ride the sky
Give me wings to fly, ride the sky
Ride the sky, ride the sky
Give me wings to fly, ride the sky
I have to think for myself and then act
In conformity of my own thoughts
No one should tell me what's wrong and what's right
Why don't you leave me alone?
Set me free, set me free
Send me a sign, wanna leave it all behind
I'll be leaving the hands of doom
Rearrange the master plan, take the future in my hands
To be free and not trapped anymore
Ride the sky, ride the sky
Give me wings to fly, ride the sky
Ride the sky, ride the sky
Give me wings to fly, ride the sky
Send me a sign, wanna leave it all behind
I'll be leaving the hands of doom
Rearrange the master plan, take the future in my hands
To be free and not trapped anymore
Ride the sky, ride the sky
Give me wings to fly, ride the sky
Ride the sky, ride the sky
Give me wings to fly, ride the sky
Ride the sky, ride the sky
Ride the sky, give me wings to fly
