I know the whole world says to you
But I'm gonna say it too
There's no one I ever knew
Quite as beautiful as you
As beautiful as you
As beautiful as you

Oh, Jonathan, Jonathan
These are your ghosts
I'm borrowing them
I'm borrowing them
Just to convey
How very beautiful she looks today!

Sì, sì

I hope that you don't mind
I'll give 'em back after I'm done
One more chorus, line, and it's the end of the song

I know the whole world says to you
But I'm gonna say it too
There's no one I ever knew
Quite as beautiful as you
As beautiful as you
As beautiful as you

As beautiful as you
As beautiful as you
As beautiful as you
As beautiful as you
As beautiful as you
As beautiful as you
As beautiful as you
As beautiful as you
As beautiful as you
As beautiful as you
