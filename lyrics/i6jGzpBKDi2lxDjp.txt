Try to run, try to hide
If you don't you'll surely die
Screaming in terror there you'll lie
In Cirith Ungol, Tower of Fire

Gorgons are shrieking their bestial cries
Their piercing cry burns you inside
Screaming in anguish, there you'll lie
In Cirith Ungol, Tower of Fire

Demons circle the smoky skies
Your fate hangs before you, on a wheel of fire
As you stand revealed to Satan's eye
In Cirith Ungol, Tower of Fire
