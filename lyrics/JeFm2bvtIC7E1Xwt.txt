If you're reading this then that means that I am dead
What was the last thing that you told me?
The night is over, but I still have a place to go
No one else but I will be there

Walking by myself with a funeral in my head
I hope you're happy what you're doing
You know how that they say
You cant help but love the dead
That's exactly where I'm heading

And I can make you love me
And I can make you love me

You wanna fight, fight, fight, fight fire with fire
You're gonna burn down
You're gonna fall in love with my work a lot
You're gonna hate the way you left me behind

And I can make you love me
And I can make you love me

And I can make you love me
And I can make you love me

Whoa whoa whoa whoa-o
Whoa whoa whoa whoa-o
Whoa whoa whoa whoa-o
