I got some things to do, but I don't want to do 'em
I got some things to say, I will never say 'em to your face
I lost my lungs, I don't really need 'em
I lost my heart, I don't really need it anymore
I am in love with somebody and guess what? It's not you
It's not you
You are in love with somebody, yeah, you love yourself so well
Love yourself so well
Smokey hands and sweaty palms
Black water and half-clear lungs
And I know I'm not going home
Broken bottles and dirty dishes
Acid flashbacks in your kitchen
You know I'm not going home
I am in love with somebody and guess what? It's not you
It's not you
You are in love with somebody, yeah, you love yourself so well
Love yourself so well
There's someone else
They love them well
Someone else
They love them
I got some things to do, but I don't want to do 'em
I got some things to say, I will never say 'em to your face
I got some things to do, but I don't want to do 'em
I got some things to say, I will never say 'em to your face
To your face
There's someone else
They love them well
This is someone else
They love them
