Breathe in
Breathe out
You had your shot you blew it all
Right now
Dead end
Your rescue team is miles away
Breathe in
Breathe out
You had your shot you blew it all
Right now
Dead end
Your rescue team is miles away
People talk behind your back
In idle news become a clown
For those you despise, those you never count
They cheered you while you crashed
Chasing your dreams
Paying your bills
Here you go again
Definite sign
You are around
No it's not a shame to be a family man
To be a family man
Stand still
Slow down
You had your shot you blew it all
Right now
Dead end
Your rescue team is miles away
Hard boy
Blank heart
How shallow can you get?
Stand still
Slow down
Where else can you go?
Chasing your dreams
Paying your bills
Here you go again
Definite sign
You are around
No it's not a shame to be a family man
To be a family man
Family man
Family man
Family man
Family man
To be a family man
