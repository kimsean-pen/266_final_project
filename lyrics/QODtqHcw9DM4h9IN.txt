Crawling out, you need to protect me
I'm calling out, find me a stronger hand

I stand on the edge of silence
Better confess, it tastes like I'm leaving

Suddenly I'll leave it all behind

Tell your heart to jump to another
But darkness grows and oh, a never-ending night

I stand on the edge of silence
Better confess, it tastes like I'm leaving

Suddenly I'll leave it all behind
Ashes to ashes, it leaves me with nothing
I'm falling away, well, if you want it
The touch and the spell, her eyes are so wild
We stand on the edge, it tastes like I'm leaving
Suddenly I'll leave it all behind
