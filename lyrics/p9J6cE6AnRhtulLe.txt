You chose a giant step - caught your eye
Guaranteed sweetness that you thought broken
And you were not fine
And bearing in mind
Other ones that you could have wed
And hopefully dread

And I wouldn't dare to
Bring out this
Awful bliss

No I wouldn't dare to
Bring out this
Awful bliss

No I wouldn't dare to
Bring out this
Awful bliss
