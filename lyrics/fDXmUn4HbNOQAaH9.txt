Hold your horses, out of water
Don't come closer, don't, don't look over me
I'm like porcelain
When you're with me,
All, all I know is

Just found a million ways to harm you
All the things I shouldn't say
All the things I wanna make you happy
It comes out of me

What if I am dropped, dropped the ceiling?
Close my eyes, drove, drove faster
I'm like porcelain
When I love you, oh
I know it

Just found a million ways to harm you
All the things I shouldn't say
All the things I wanna make you happy
It comes out of me
We don't count the power of destruction
You can always waiting for
But when we try to work us on the??
It's too God damn hard!

Kill it the thought
It takes a lot
To trust that someone else
Will catch my fall
It takes a lifetime
Breaking ghost fast
When everything that matters
Made of glass

Just found a million ways to harm you
All the things I shouldn't say
All the things I wanna make you happy
It comes out of me
Just found a million ways to harm you
All the things I shouldn't say
All the things I wanna make you happy
It comes out of me
We don't count the power of destruction
You can always waiting for
But when we try to work us on the??
It's too God damn hard!

I'm like porcelain
I'm like porcelain
I'm like porcelain
I'm like porcelain
