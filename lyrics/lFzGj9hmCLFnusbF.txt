All I need is a kiss,
All I need is a smile,
All I need is your love love
If you're free tonight

All I need is a kiss,
A kiss that made me fall in love,
All I need is one more smile.

Why should I care
If you turn and walk away
Why should I care
If the Earth is gone today
Why should I care
When you break my heart,
When I break your heart
And then nothing seems to change.

All I need is a kiss,
All I need is a smile,
All I need is your love love.
