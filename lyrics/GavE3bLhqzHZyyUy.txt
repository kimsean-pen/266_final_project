I've been seeking silver linings, feeling incomplete
Singing: Oh, I wish it didn't taste so bittersweet
So enamored, stutter, stammered, oh, my voice was broke
Like a poor man stood before the queen
I tripped over my tongue before I spoke

And though I never said it with words
There was love in the silence
Even now after all of these years
You're the light in my darkness

Used to share that feeling, dreaming
Gazing at the bedroom ceiling
Oh oh, now I'm late, you wishing you'd come home

And though I never said it with words
There was love in the silence
Even now after all of these years
You're the light in my darkness
Darling, please, listen close and you'll hear
There's still love in the silence
Even now after all these long years
I feel love in the quiet

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh

And though I never said it with words
There was love in the silence
Even now after all of these years
You're the light in my darkness
Darling, please, listen close and you'll hear
There's still love in the silence
Even now after all these long years
I feel love in the quiet
