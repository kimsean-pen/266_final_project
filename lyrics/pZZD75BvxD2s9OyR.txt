All these things I know, I never wished for
this is all the muck I learned from you
all these things I know, I never wished for you to show
all these things I know, I got from you
I'm so glad you're here, I've really missed you
(I could say a few things, but I'm shy)
Heaven sent you here, and I can send you right back, dear
heaven knows I've got a thing or two
and oh, how I'd love you
All these things I have, I'd never live through
This feeling I have couldn't be for real
heaven sent you here, and I can send you right back, dear
heaven knows I've learned a thing or two
