When I was sixteen
I dated a boy
With my own name
It was weird
In the back of his truck
Moaning my name
While trying to fuck
And I didn't think you had to
Go to town
And tell everybody's mom
That I'm
Sleeping around

Ready?

Now I realize
That all my friends are
Mostly friends
With you
And I don't know
Who would show up to my
Barbecue

And I
Think you're the kind of guy
Who would meet me at a party
And forget my name
And try to take me home
All the same

Now I
I'm all alone
In the grocery store
Wondering who
I'm buying all of these
Hot dogs for

And I
Think you're the kind of guy
Who would meet me at a party
And forget my name
And try to take me home
All the same

Now I
Will never barbecue again
And you can keep all of your
Shitty friends
And I
Will never barbecue again
And I
Will never think of you again
