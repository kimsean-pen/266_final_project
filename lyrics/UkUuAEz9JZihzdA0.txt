Day and night, no matter where you go
They hold the mirror
For you to swallow
Your pride and honour
And there they are staring at you everywhere
You go!

They are in your head, you are overpowered,
They are there like worms eating your guts.
Can you stop the clocks? Tick, tick, tock, in your
Ears?
Stop the spinning of the psycho circus in my mind!

They are the voice of the conscience,
The voice of attrition,
Whispers in your prison.
They are there all the time
Until you find expiation of your evil deeds!

They are in your head, you are overpowered,
They are there like worms eating your guts.
Can you stop the clocks? Tick, tick, tock, in your
Ears?
Stop the spinning of the psycho circus in my mind!

They are in your head, you are overpowered,
They are there like worms eating your guts.
Can you stop the clocks? Tick, tick, tock, in your
Ears?
Stop the spinning of the psycho circus in my mind!
