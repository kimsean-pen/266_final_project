Im in that HBA lingerie
All white, Mid-day just a matinee
Body tight, Face right
(Mother fuckers they talking bout you)
Fuck life, no lives (Your niggas need to tell the the truth)
Burn that stress
Drink that pain
(Get It How I Get it)
Hit that gear, Switch that lane
(Get It How I Get It)
See the way I'm running Don't ask how I did it
See the way I play that game

Prolly say fuck what they say
What the fuck I gotta prove

Jeans tight, Green light (Mother fuckers they talking bout you)
All me, All eyes (Your niggas need to tell the the truth)
Burn that stress
Drink that pain
(Get It How I Get it)
Hit that gear, Switch that lane
(Get It How I Get It)
See the way I'm running, Don't ask how I did it
See the way I play that game
You prolly say they fixed it
Prolly say fuck what they say
