What are we gonna do,
when you've stopped crying?
What ever you're going through
it's not worth dying.

Chasing away the blues,
I know you're trying.
And nobody wants to lose,
I don't know why.

Cause I live by the river,
live by the river and
I'll die by the river
I'm sailing, away, today.

What are you gonna say
when they stop laughing?
You're giving it all away
when you've got nothing.

How many times a day
you feel like walking?
Taking a holiday from
all the shy-y-y...

But I live by the river,
live by the river and
I'll die by the river
I'm sailing, away, today.

Cause I live by the river,
live by the river and
I'll die by the river
I'm sailing, away, today.

And you've got to grab
the bull by the horns my friend
it's the only way to go.

And when the story's told
we can go home.

So what are we gonna do,
when you've stopped crying?
What ever you're going through
it's not worth dying.

Keeping away the blues
you know I'm trying.
What've we got to lose,
and testify-y-y...

Cause I live by the river,
live by the river and
I'll die by the river
I'm sailing, away,
I'm sailing, away,
I'm sailing, away, today.
