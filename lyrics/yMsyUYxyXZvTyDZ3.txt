I don't need no doctor
'Cause I know what's ailin' me
I don't need no doctor
'Cause I know what's ailin' me, yes, I do
All I need is my baby
You don't know I'm in misery

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

I don't need no doctor
My prescription tells me that

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

I don't need no doctor
My prescription tells me that

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

All I need is my baby
You don't know [Incomprehensible]

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

Well, the doctor said, I need rest
He put me on the critical list
Keeping me safe from harm
All I need is her sweet charm

He gave me a medical lotion that wouldn't do
Ooh, yeah, my motion, oh, yeah

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
