Thanks for showing me around last night
Hope you don't think I don't care
Cause I do, I just don't know if I should feel this bad about you
How'd you finish on your birthday
Heard you got a yearbook unprepared
Big dream is up(?) just sleep it off
It comes out to collect it
(Pre-)
I think you're funny, I like your friends
I like the way they treat you
I've got some money that we can spend
I bet you like that!

We're falling in love again
