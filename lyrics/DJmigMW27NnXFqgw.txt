Last day brings the grace
For bearers of forbidden name
Step into five-fold mace
As son as father in a frame

Someday fire wipes the rain
Fears are frozen tears
Whisper things that no one hears
Cry now, cry now for me again
Tomorrow's pride and pain

Why you kneel before my name

Crushing my belief
And make shape to my relief
For who you said your prayers
I can't hear them anyway
Someday fire wipes the rain
Fears and frozen tears
Whispers things that no one hears
Cry now, cry now for me again
Tomorrow's pride and pain
Why you kneel before my pain
Someday fire wipes the rain
Fears and frozen tears
Whispers things that no one hears
Cry now, cry now for me again
Tomorrow's pride and pain
Why you kneel before my pain
