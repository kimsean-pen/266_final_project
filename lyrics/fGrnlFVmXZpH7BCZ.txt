Like pebbles on a beach
Kicked around, displaced by feet
Oh, like broken stones
They're all trying to get home

Like a loser's reach
Too slow and short to hit the peaks
Yeah, so lost and alone
Yeah, trying to get home

As another pitch shatters
Another little bit gets lost
What else really matters
(Oooh)
Oh, such a cost

Like a loser's reach
Too slow and short to hit the peaks
Yeah, lost and alone
Yeah, you can stay home
(Yeah, trying to get home)
(Yeah, trying to get home)

And another pitch shatters
Another little bit gets lost
Tell me what else really matters
(Yeah)
Oh, such a cost
(Oooh)

Like pebbles on a beach
Kicked around, displaced by feet
Oh, like broken stones
They're all trying to get home

Like a loser's reach
Too slow and short to hit the peaks
Yeah, lost and alone
Yeah, trying to get home

Trying to get home
Trying to get home
Like broken stones
Oh, trying to get home
Ooh, trying to get home
Like broken stones
