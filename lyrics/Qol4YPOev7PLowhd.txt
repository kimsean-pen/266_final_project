Oh lover boy, to you I belong
Maybe one day you'll wake, and you'll find me gone
Oh lover boy, if you call me home
I'll come driving, I'll come driving fast as wheels can turn
Oh lover boy, I know you too well
All of my lonely secrets to you I tell
The highest of highs, the lowest of lows
I'll come driving, I'll come driving fast as wheels can turn
Driving, I'll come driving, fast as wheels can turn
Stretching away as far as I can see
Deserts and darkness, my hand on the wheel
Lover boy, please call me home
A girl can get lonely out here on her own
He said, somedays I find the old ways frighten me too easily
I leave my key and say I'm too young
Lover boy if you call me home
I'll come driving, I'll come driving fast as wheels can turn
Driving, I'll come driving, fast as wheels can turn
Driving, I'll come driving
