You know that my loving
Don't stop, won't stop
See you popping, you're buzzing
To the top, won't flop
Like, I can't help it
I ain't selfish
Anytime that you need some, I be waiting here for you
Know you love it, 'cause you keep coming
Have you made love on the sand?
It's something we should do
I just wanna have sex on the beach
Take a ride to Ocean Drive
I just wanna have sex on the beach
Take a ride to Ocean Drive
Oh-oh-woah-oh

We got a couple of haters
Don't stop won't stop
Got a couple spectators
To the top, won't flop
No, we ain't stopping
They all watching
Anytime that you need some, I be waiting here for you
Know that jacket
Be my captain
Have you made love on the sand?
It's something we should do
I just wanna have sex on the beach
Take a ride to Ocean Drive
