Old yellow bricks
Love's a risk
Quite the little Escapologist
Looked so miffed
When you wished
For a thousand places better than this

You are the fugitive
But you don't know what you're runnin' from
You can't kid us
And you couldn't trick anyone
Houdini, love you don't know what you're runnin' away from

Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?

She was enraged by the way
That the emperor put traps in the cage
And the days she being dull
Lead to nights readin' beer bottles

You're such a fugitive
But you don't know what you're runnin' from
You can't kid us
And you couldn't trick anyone
Houdini, love you don't know what you're runnin' away from

Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

You're at a loss
Just because
It wasn't all that you thought it was
You are a fugitive but you don't know what you're runnin' away from
She said I want to sleep in the city that never wakes up
And revel in nostalgia
I know I said who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up but
Dorothy was right though
