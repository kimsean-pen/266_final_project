With your hair of flaming Roses
Your kiss - Medusa's touch
Turn me to a pillar of salt
To die now would be perfection

Then my lonliness closes in
So, I drink a German wine
And drift in dreams of other lives
And greater times

White sheets wrap my mind
In drunken thoughts of runes and men
Why does the devil leave for us
This legacy of lonliness

This cry for the moon
And a dagger's thrust
With your hair of flaming blooms
And your eyes of saintly dusk

Then my lonliness closes in
So, I drink a German wine
And drift in dreams of other lives
And greater times...
