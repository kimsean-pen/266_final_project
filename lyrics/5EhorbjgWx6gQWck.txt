Unspeakable wretched thoughts intensify
As she caught my eye - so divine
Young slender blond haired muse
Hard to refuse my urge to abuse
Her beautiful smile so fine
In my morbid mind to the floor I grind
Such a thrilling illusion
That pretty silky skin all soaked in sin
As my knife goes in

Forced to the floor
Cuffed and gagged
Tearing severe
Pleading
Don't be scared I'll end you quick
Blunt force trauma
Your head I'll split
Bleeding

Anne, don't fear
You'll live through me forever
Until your body from decay collapse
I'll come back to relapse

My filthy sinister plan now set in motion
I approach with great devotion
A tale of broken arm and my harmless charm
From the herd she's drawn - to my car
Once there I'll smack her head
Then we're off to the place all women dread
A secluded old shed
Soon I will reach my edge
With my manhood fed to her severed head

Anne, don't fear
You'll live through me forever
See, I brought a friend to watch me smash your
Head with a rock
Anne don't fear
You'll live through me forever
Until your body from decay collapse
I'll come back to relapse
Meeting you was such a delight
