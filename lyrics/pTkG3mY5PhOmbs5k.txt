Cross your t's and
Dot your i's
Take note when
The raven flies
And always keep
One eye upon the fool
Without fear or favor
Speak to them
With good behavior
To condemn
And keep the other
Eye upon the cruel

Reach down deep,
Stand your ground
We've only just begun
Turn no cheek,
In step and pound
Until the job is done
And walk, walk

Call them out,
On their shit
Demand they listen
When you talk
Wear them down,
Bit by bit
And go where few dare to walk

Do unto others,
As unto you
Bite down on the
Golden rule
And always keep
A match to lite the fuse
Walk softly, carry
A big stick
And disassemble
Brick by brick
And never think
Our outcome is to lose

Reach down deep,
Stand your ground
We've only just begun
Turn no cheek,
In step and pound
Until the job is done
And walk, walk

Call them out, on their shit
Demand they listen when you talk
Wear them down, bit by bit
And go where few dare to walk

Where few dare to
Bite your lip, step in time
Lean on me, up we climb
Reach down deep, clench your fist
Turn no cheek, to resist

Where few dare to
Bite your lip, step in time
Lean on me, up we climb
Reach down deep, clench your fist
Turn no cheek, to resist

Call them out, on their shit
Demand they listen when you talk
Wear them down, bit by bit
And go where few dare to walk

Walk, walk, walk
