We're outside, it's cold enough to see your breath
You don't mind, undressing 'til there's nothin' left
I feel the fire, it's comforting, it lights you up
I see everything I need right here and

Now we're swimming in the moonlight

Here outside, it's just you and I
I couldn't love you more if I tried
It's crystal clear as we disappear
Swimming in the moonlight

Though we're moving quickly it feels I've waited all my life
Until this moment I'd only dreamed of paradise
For hours without a single word, we hold on tight
If nothing's perfect, you and I are nothing tonight

Now we're swimming in the moonlight
Now we're swimming, swimming in the moonlight

Here outside, it's just you and I
I couldn't love you more if I tried
It's crystal clear as we disappear
Swimming in the moonlight
Here outside, it's just you and I
I couldn't love you more if I tried
It's crystal clear as we disappear
Swimming in the moonlight

You have no clue how gorgeous you are
Thank God, oh
In a time when nothing's right
You shine a light
You're my everything, everything, everything

Here outside, it's just you and I
I couldn't love you more if I tried
It's crystal clear as we disappear
Swimming in the moonlight
Here outside, it's just you and I
I couldn't love you more if I tried
It's crystal clear as we disappear
Swimming in the moonlight

You have no clue how gorgeous you are
Thank God, oh
You're the moon, my blue lagoon, my favorite tune
Everything, everything, everything
