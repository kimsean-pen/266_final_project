In practice past, I'm closing off
Untethered by visions
Unfamiliar
All lines of sight
Obstructed by light

For what lies beneath
And remains on the surface

Don't blame all that is lost
We revive ourselves

I'll break it off
Severing all ties
I won't look back
Fragments must realign
Dimming the sparks
That burned so bright

We'll never know how this could be
To build it up and break it off
There's more to keep and less to leave behind
There's more to lose and more to try and find

Don't blame all that is lost
We revive ourselves

Unafraid of the aftermath
The bones of what's below will never grow
