I can't believe what we've seen outside
You and me watching the jets go by
Oh, Oooh, Oh
Oh, Oooh, Oh

Drown by sea, so many people've already drowned
You and me watching a sea full of people
Try not to drown

So many people, so many people
Where do they go?
You and me watching a sky
Full of chemtrails
That's where we belong

All I can take from these skies is hope
But all I can see in this light are boats
Sinking
Oh, Oooh, Oh
Oh, Oooh, Oh

Down by the sea swallowed by evil
They've already drowned
You and me watching a sea of people
Already drowned

So many people, so many people
Where do they go?
You and me hit by a test of white evil rain
Watching the jet planes go by

You and me watching
You and me watching
The chemtrails is where we belong
That's where we'll be when we die in the slipstream
We'll climb in a hole in the sky
