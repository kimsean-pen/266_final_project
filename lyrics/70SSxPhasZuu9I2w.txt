There's something that's been growing inside of me
Uh-uh, baby, baby
Uh-uh, baby, baby
I haven't been myself since we met last week
Uh-uh, baby, baby
Uh-uh, baby, baby

When I'm alone at night
I sit and fantasize
And in my fantasies I love you long time
During my 9 to 5, I'm thinking 6 and 9s
I've gotta make you mine

Can you feel my-
Dirty desire, you're my-
Dirty desire, you're my-
Dirty desire, can you feel my-
Dirty desire, you're my-
Dirty desire, you're my-
Dirty desire, dirty desire

Dirty desire (uh)
Dirty desire (uh)
Dirty desire (uh)
Dirty desire

I know you've thought about it
But it's all in your head
And you can't wait to see me
To see me in the flesh

I see you really need to
Get this thing off your chest
But um, you know I gotta
Get you back in my nest

I tried to let it go
But that made me want you more
'Cos in reality I know you're not mine
I don't want just a bite
I want the full size
Tell her I'll pay the fine

Can you feel my-
Dirty desire, you're my-
Dirty desire, you're my-
Dirty desire, can you feel my-
Dirty desire, you're my-
Dirty desire, you're my-
Dirty desire, can you feel my-
Dirty desire, you're my-
Dirty desire, you're my-
Dirty desire, can you feel my-
Dirty desire, you're my-
Dirty desire, you're my-
Dirty desire, dirty desire

When I'm alone at night
I sit and fantasize
And in my fantasies I love you long time
During my 9 to 5, I'm thinking 6 and 9s
I've gotta make you mine

Can you feel my-
Dirty desire, you're my-
Dirty desire, you're my-
Dirty desire, can you feel my-
Dirty desire, you're my-
Dirty desire, you're my-
Dirty desire, dirty desire

Know whatcha doin' babe
You're not my boyfriend
As long as we know babe
I'm not your girlfriend

Know whatcha doin' babe
You're not my boyfriend
As long as we know babe
I'm not your girlfriend
