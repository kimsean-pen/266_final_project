Rolling fast down I-35
Supersonic overdrive
Rolling fast down I-35
Through the day and past the night

Rolling fast down I-45
Get ahead, going 109
Rolling fast down I-45
Bending time, feeling fine

Rolling fast down 75
Empty road, moonlit sky
Rolling fast down 75
Cutting through like a knife

Rolling fast down I-35
Polarized into the light
Rolling fast down I-35
Interstellar hyper drive
