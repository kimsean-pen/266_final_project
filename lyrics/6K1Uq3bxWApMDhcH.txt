I wanted to be a smoking man
Filter out all the lights
I'm bending the darkness with my lungs
Until every breath was tight
But I choked myself in my own hate
I'll replay my death until it's not pretend

I wanted to be the holy man
All knowing and always right
I never believed that this would end
The cyclical trip of life
But I melt into the street again
As I walk the path to meet my end
And the devil comes to greet me like a friend

I wanna see it
I wanna feel it again
I wanna see it
Let it consume me again

I wanna take it
If you would let me in
I wanna know it
Let me love it again

I wanna see it
I wanna feel it again
I wanna see it
Let it consume me again
I wanna take it
If you would let me in
I wanna know it
Let me love it again

I built the cage I'm locked inside
Uninspired by the divine
Reality dances in my eyes
So I walk in crooked lines
I built the cage I'm locked inside
Uninspired by the divine
Reality dances in my eyes
So I walk in crooked lines

Don't wanna see it
Don't wanna feel it again
Don't wanna see it
It won't consume me again

Don't wanna take it
Please don't let me in
Don't wanna know it
No I can't love it again
Love it again
Love it again
Love it again
Love it again
Love it again
