Ooh. Heh

I think I'm overdosin'
Tryna keep up with the fuckin' motion
My mind out in the open
Tryna stay fucking focused

I think I'm overdosing
I done took too many other doses
My mind out in the open
Imma keep up with the fucking motion

Baby girl that pussy go, damn
Baby let me bust it open
Let me get up in your ocean
Baby got me overdosing

Don't you lie to me, Lie to me
You trying me
Took your soul, lil' baby gone ride with me
You are mad, bitch that's fine by me

I love when I overdose
I OD off of your love (love!)
I OD off of your love (love!)
I OD off of your love (Love!)
I OD off of your love (I don't even feel your love!)

Baby girl that pussy go, damn
Baby let me bust it open
Let me swim up in your ocean
Baby got me overdosing

Lie to me
Lie to me, don't lie to me
