Could you point me towards
a quiet gathering
Full of bugs and holes
Where any words said to you
Holds a liquored, puzzled truth
It's just a habit
It's just a habit
It's just a habit

If I slur a bit
It's just because I'm confused
Don't think much of it
My days belong to you
If you're kind my nights can too
It's just a habit
It's just a habit
It's just a habit
