Bad snow freeze my throat
And numbs my soul
Eats me whole to pick me up
That's where you know
Free to go
You call the Jones
Makes me old before I'm old
It's all you love
Deep inside I know you love
The less the I seem to know you love

Bad snow numbs my throat
And leaves me dry leaves me dry
Leaves me barely whole
Down to the wire
Rock gone cold
You caught a cold
Like so many times before its all you love
Deep inside I go you love
The less the I seem to know you love

Here now, deep inside I go
Here now
