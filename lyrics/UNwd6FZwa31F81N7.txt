And you say this ain't living
You say you can't go on
They only take as you're giving
And now your hope is all but gone

Though you lost your way
Now is not forever
But I know your pain

We all fall sometimes, you're not the first
But I know it hurts
Yeah, I know it hurts
In the end you'll find what you deserve
Still I know it hurts
Yeah, I know it hurts

And the tide's only rising
The storm is on its way
But you can't keep on fighting
So battleworn and so afraid

Though it's sad and wrong
I hope you will remember
That you must carry on

We all fall sometimes, you're not the first
But I know it hurts
Yeah, I know it hurts
In the end you'll find what you deserve
Still I know it hurts
Yeah, I know it hurts

There's still tomorrow, hold on, hold on
There's still tomorrow, just wait, just wait
There's still tomorrow, hold on
Hold on

We all fall sometimes, you're not the first
But I know it hurts
Yeah, I know it hurts
In the end you'll find what you deserve
Still I know it hurts
Yeah, I know it hurts
