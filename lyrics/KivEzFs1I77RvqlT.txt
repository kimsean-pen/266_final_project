How did I get here
And what have I done?
It's like I've been sleeping for two years
And I'm just waking up
Like I'm coming out of a blackout
Like I didn't see you 'till right now
I look around and I'm feeling like
I built a prison and put myself in it

(Ahh, ahh)
I don't wanna go through the motions
(Ahh, ahh)
No, I don't wanna

I can't stand it when you touch me like that
'Cause it just reminds me of the nights that I spent
Telling myself it was fine
But now I'm over that
I think it's better if we just pretend
We're just strangers again

Where do I go now?
And where do I start?
I don't wanna pick up the pieces
I just wanna watch it all fall apart,
fall apart, like it should
Fall apart like I said I would
I wanted out but you held me down
And fed me the lies I told you myself

(Ahh, ahh)
I don't wanna go through the motions
(Ahh, ahh)
No, I don't wanna

I can't stand it when you touch me like that
'Cause it just reminds me of the nights that I spent
Telling myself it was fine
But now I'm over that
I think it's better if we just pretend
We're just strangers again

We had what we had but it's done
And I'm over it
Held on for too long when I should've let go of it
And I know it was wrong but I tried to keep hold of it
It was wrong, it was wrong, it was wrong

I can't stand it when you touch me like that
'Cause it just reminds me of the nights that I spent
Telling myself it was fine
But now I'm over that
I think it's better if we just pretend
We're just strangers again
I can't stand it when you touch me like that
'Cause it just reminds me of the nights that I spent
Telling myself it was fine
But now I'm over that
I think it's better if we just pretend
We're just strangers again
