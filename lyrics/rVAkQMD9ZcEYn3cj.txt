I picked up my belongings
In a nylon carry-all
I hear the porter call
He said, "The sky's the limit
On this chartered trip away,"
Guess I'd better stay

Out there on the desert
I see trees on every wall
Nothing's ever solved
He said, "The sky's the limit
On this chartered trip away,"
Guess I'd better stay away

I thought I owed myself a trip away
I wanted to go to places
I have never been away
I looked at the pictures
Imagine where they lay away
On a beach, by the sea
Where their clothes all lay away

I picked up my belongings
In a nylon carry-all
I hear the porter call
Horizon is oblivious, chartered trip away
Guess I'd better stay

Out there on the desert
I see trees on every wall
Nothing's ever solved
Horizon is oblivious, chartered trip away
Guess I'd better stay away

I thought I owed myself a trip away
I wanted to go to places
I have never been away
I looked at the pictures
Imagine where they lay away
On a beach, by the sea
Where their clothes all lay away

I picked up my belongings
In a nylon carry-all
I hear the porter call
He said, "There's no returning
From this chartered trip away,"...
