不需要蒼白言語
一字一句拉開間距
Oh yeah, but you already know what I'm about to say
其實都難以言喻
以怎樣的速率前去
Oh yeah, thought I would but I ain't here to play
Said I could
Let you in but I hate it when you see through me
Got you good
That night when I was acting unruly
Hold me close
Do me do me you don't have to do me properly
Let me know
通往你靈魂最深處最蜿蜒的路徑

Yeah you got me riding riding riding riding like crazy
持續感覺你的氣息溫度直到滿足我的我的我的味蕾
與你一路飛馳緊握著方向盤
錶盤指針在我腦海裡不停轉
Going like a Mercedes Got me riding like crazy

撕扯著陌生面具
將所剩的熟悉減去
Oh yeah, I gotta know you there ain't no other way
How you feel
扼住咽喉侵入流淌在這瞬息裡
Make it real
泡沫般的幻象相擁彼此共呼吸
Yeah you got me riding riding riding riding like crazy
持續感覺你的氣息溫度直到滿足我的我的我的味蕾
與你一路飛馳緊握著方向盤
錶盤指針在我腦海裡不停轉
Going like a Mercedes got me riding like crazy

I wanna know you body
Keep on climbing with me
I wanna know your body

I wanna know you body
Keep on climbing with me
I wanna know your body

Yeah you got me riding riding riding riding like crazy
持續感覺你的氣息溫度直到滿足我的我的我的味蕾
與你一路飛馳緊握著方向盤
錶盤指針在我腦海裡不停轉
Going like a Mercedes Got me riding like crazy

Yeah you got me riding riding riding riding like crazy
持續感覺你的氣息溫度直到滿足我的我的我的味蕾
與你一路飛馳緊握著方向盤
錶盤指針在我腦海裡不停轉
Going like a Mercedes Got me riding like crazy
