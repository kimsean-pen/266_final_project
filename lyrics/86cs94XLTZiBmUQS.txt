I just don't wanna be lonely
Cause the lights, were shining ever so bright
In my hand there's a pulse of my beating heart
Biting my tongue there's a plastic man on the telephone

Can you see the bright light? Shining, I dont know
can you see the bright light? Shining, shining, shining

I saw a UFO and nobody believes me
I was sixteen miles from home with nobody in sight
I saw a UFO but nobody believes me
And Whats it gonna take to get me back home tonight

Can you see the bright light? Shining, I dont know
Is it a reflection of anyone? The big glow
And tell me this is all good, and you say, I dont know
Im very very far from home

I saw a UFO and nobody believes me
I was sixteen miles from home with nobody in sight
I saw a UFO but nobody believes me
And Whats it gonna take to get me back home tonight

(hello? hello? hello? hello?)

I saw a UFO and nobody believes me
I was sixteen miles from home with nobody in sight
I saw a UFO and nobody believes me
And whats it gonna take to get me back home tonight

And whats it gonna take to
And whats it gonna take to
And whats it gonna, whats it gonna
And whats it gonna take to
And whats it gonna take to
And whats it gonna take to, get me back home tonight
(tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
