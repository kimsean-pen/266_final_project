In my dream I'm in that grey room
In my chest I'm feeling dark blue
Take the redline into downtown
I'm trying to escape you

Crying on the subway
Cuz I remember on that Thursday
How everything was different
Oh, I'm always gonna miss it

If I could ever change things
If I could ever forget
I would be no longer living
Oh, you know I'll always say yes

If you should end up winning
If I should ever regret
I will be no longer living
Oh, you know I'll always say yes
