And I was like, "Why you so obsessed with me?"

So oh oh, so oh oh
So oh oh, so oh oh
So oh oh, so oh oh...

Will the real MC please step to the mic?
MC, you need an MC, place to be
MC the MC

All up in the blogs
Say we met at the bar
When I don't even know who you are
Say we up in your house
Sayin' I'm up in your car
But you in LA and I'm out at Jermaine's

I'm up in the A- you're so so lame
And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, it must be the E
'Cause you be poppin', hood, you get it pop, pin'

Ooh why you so obsessed with me?
Boy, I want to know! Lyin' that you're sexin' me
When everybody knows it's clear that you're upset with me
Ohh finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the Earth still couldn't hit this

You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losing your mind
It's confusin' yo, you're confused, you know
Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
See right through you like you're bathin' in Windex

Ooh ohh ohh boy, why you so obsessed with me?
And all the ladies sing, all the girls sing
Soo ohhhh, soo ohh obsessed

You on your job, you hatin' hard
Ain't gon' feed you, I'mma let you starve
Gaspin' for air, I'm ventilation
You out of breath, hope you ain't waitin'
Tellin' the world how much you miss me
But we never were so why you trippin'
You a mom and pop, I'm a corporation
I'm the press conference, you a conversation

Ooh why you so obsessed with me?
Boy I want to know... lyin' that you're sexin me
When everybody knows it's clear that you're upset with me
Ohh finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the Earth still couldn't hit this

You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losing your mind
It's confusin yo, you're confused you know
Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
See right through you like you're bathin' in Windex

Ooh ohh ohh boy, why you so obsessed with me?
And all the ladies sing, all the girls sing
Soo ohhhh, soo ohh obsessed.
