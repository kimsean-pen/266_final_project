Ken is a cool friend of mine from
Way back plenty years
I ain't seem him for so long
But the memories are dear
We used to play some rock and roll
At Conway studio
Man we shared some laughs
And secrets told

So I just called up my old buddy, "Hey...
It's time to hit the road
You know we ain't gettin' younger brother
Life's tickin' on
'Cause there's a song that's waitin' for us
Just around the bend
Oh it's already feelin' better
Oh it's already lookin' brighter
I'll be ready when
Oh yes it's dreaming time again

I packed up all my travelin' gear
And I drove to Montreal
'Cause my sweetheart's waitin' there for me
Autumn leaves begin to fall
I will roll the dice
And take my chances as they come
'Cause you and I, we want
To chase the sun

So my friends, give me your true intention
That discovery can't find
Life is full of magic wonders
When you open up your mind
There's a new adventure movin'
Just around the bend
Oh it's already lookin' better
Oh it's already feelin' brighter
I'll remember when
Oh yes it's dreaming time again, oh yeah
Dreaming time, oh yeah

I can see the rainbow risin'
Up above the clouds
Oh it's already feelin' better
Oh it's already lookin' brighter
I'll be ready when
Oh yes it's dreaming time again

Oh na-na-na-na-na-na
Oh na-na-na-na-na-na

Oh let your love shine in and dream again
