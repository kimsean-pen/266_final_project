Goodbye

It could happen to you
A defect from the wasted outskirts of Los Angeles
With a crumpled-up pass for the RTD
And no authority or trajectory
On the brink of insanity

Yeah, you better believe it
'Cause it's written all over your face
Just a neighborhood reject
Out of step and out of place
You better believe it

Would you ever have thought, persistence
Could prevail against the almost
Unbearable weights of the system?
With nothing better to do
And no one else who you can look up to

Yeah, you better believe it
'Cause it's written all over your face
A political defect
Out of step and out of place
You better believe it

And the future is bright
When ideas run astray
So turn out the light
A punk can't have a say
Sometimes desire is all that's there
Who said life was fair? Better believe it

Yeah, you better believe it
'Cause it's written all over your face
Just a neighborhood reject
Out of step and out of place
You better believe it

You better believe it
You gotta believe it
'Cause it's written all over your face
A political defect
Out of step and out of place

You better believe it
You gotta believe it
It's written all over your face
As a cultural reject

Out of step and out of place
You better believe it
You better believe it
