Spinning inside, rotting away
Something inside of me has been taken away
Feeling my heart breaking in vain
It won't get better now, when will this end?

I can't seem to get away
I feel I'm here so you can play with my head
There's nothing I can say
I keep feeling like I'm to blame
When will this end?

Hopeless inside, alone as I wait
Brewing inside of me is your endless hate
Feeling my heart breaking in vain
It won't get better now, when will this end?

I can't seem to get away
I feel I'm here so you can play with my head
There's nothing I can say
I keep feeling like I'm to blame
When will this end?

The stress is rising and I can't seem to get away from you
You're always trying and the lying always shines right through
My God, I hate this, always take shit, can I let this go on?
Why can't I break this, I just take this as this goes on and on
End! When will this end?
When will this end?
When will this end?
When will this end?
When will this end?
When will this end?
When will this end?

When will this end?
I can't seem to get away
I feel I'm here so you can play with my head
There's nothing I can say
I keep feeling like I'm to blame
When will this end?
