Somethings come and go
Now and then
Make you stop and sigh
Every time, everyone
Ever wonder why?

Take a walk to the trees
So we'll talk
Underneath favorite trees
In between

Some things seem so real
All you feel is a pull inside
In your mind, out of time
Every breath you sigh

Take a walk to the trees
So we'll talk
Underneath, in a dream
In between
