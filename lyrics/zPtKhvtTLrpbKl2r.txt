I love, you love, this love.
We're professional.
I know, you know, we're sophisticated at loving, loving, loving...
We're professional.

What every taste declined... I'm wondering why
What every taste declined... I'm wondering why, I'm wondering why

I love, you love, this love.
We're professional.
I know, you know, we're sophisticated at loving, loving, loving...
We're professional.

What every taste declined... I'm wondering why
What every taste declined.
. I'm wondering why, I'm wondering why why why...

I want you to hold me
You're in every dream
