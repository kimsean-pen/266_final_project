I catalog these steps now
Decisive and intentioned
Precise and patterned specifically to yours
I'm talented at breathing
Especially exhaling
So that my chest will rise and fall with yours

I'm careful not to wake you
Fearing conversation
It's better just to hold you
And keep you pacified
I'm talented with reason
I cover all the angles
I can fail before I ever try

Try to understand there's an old mistake that fools will make
And I'm the king of them, pushing everything that's good away so
Won't you hold me now (I will not bend, I will not break)
Won't you hold me now (I will not bend, I will not break)

I am fairly agile
I can bend and not break
Or I can break and take it with a smile
And I am so resilient
I recover quickly
I'll convince you soon that I am fine

Try to understand there's an old mistake that fools will make
And I'm the king of them, pushing everything that's good away so
Won't you hold me now (I will not bend, I will not break)
Won't you hold me now (For you I rise, for you I fall)

Just hold me close to you, just hold me close to you
Just hold me close to you, just hold me close to you, to you

And try to understand there's an old mistake that fools will make
And I'm the king of them, pushing everything that's good away
So won't you hold me now?
Won't you hold me now?
Now, now, now, now, now
