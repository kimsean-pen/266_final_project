Tell me lies and lullabies but don't tell me to change
Don't give me that face

Sick with hope, cracks in this heels
Bitter seal fashioned from steal

Ohh this last dance,
Turn away (turn away)
Ohh this last dance (this last dance)
To walk away (to walk away)

Tell me lies and lullabies but don't tell me to change
Don't give me that face

These oily feathers prepped for a fight
Game on, game on, game on tonight

Ohh this last dance,
Turn away (ooh, turn away)
Ohh this last dance (this last dance)
To walk away (to walk away)

This last dance,
It's tough to face (it's tough to face)
It's tough to face (it's tough to face)
This last dance (this last dance)
This last dance (this last dance)
It's tough to face (it's tough to face)
It's tough to face (it's tough to face)
This last dance (this last dance)
This last dance

Tell me lies and lullabies but don't tell me to change
Ooh, don't give me that face
