Nothing like a dream it was so true that you hit something
I never wanted to let you in
Something like the darkest roads I'm sick of the loneliness
I never wanted to feel like this
How will I know?
When will i know?
You're not coming back
We're not going home
I don't know if I will sip in and I refuse, will I?
You're everyway I can't do without
Nothing like a dream is nothing left and i'm on my own
I never wanted to let you go
How will I know?
When will I know?
We're not coming back
We're not going home
Now I'm just beside you
In the hours between
Your fictions that are rolling
On the picture screen

How will I know?
When will I know?
We're not coming back
We're not going home
I see you're lookin at me
Like I'm just looking at you
And I have never been wrong
With this type of things
Alice rolling skies
Is open earth, is a ground and storm

(IT'S PROBABLY WRONG)
