It's not enough to find a moment
As light moves away
We'll leave tonight on empty highways
There's no coming back here

The painted hallways
Forever and always
Are lost to you
How can you criticize
When you're not here to compromise?
Words fade as time goes by
Without you, without you

Fall to the floor
We're watching sideways
As day turns to night
Ghosts in the walls
Through empty doorways
Like we've always been here

The painted hallways
Forever and always
Are lost to you
How can you criticize
When you're not here to compromise?
Words fade as time goes by
Without you, without you

Without you, Without you
Without you, Without you
Without you, Without you
