Do, do, do, do, do
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Do, do, do, do, do

When you're a superstar they know your name wherever you are
Life is crazy and I like it
Pictures on magazines, autographs and ninety thousand screams
Get the dream and then you live it

Oh, wouldn't you want that too?
Who could blame you?
Oh, 'cause what I say is true, oh yeah

When you're a VIP you get whatever you please
What's Not To Like?
The fans screaming your name, all the fortune and fame
What's not to, what's not, What's Not To Like?

Yeah, hey, do, do, do, do, do
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Do, do, do, do, do

Life in the spotlight, designer clothes you wear one time
Tell me now who wouldn't love it?
Hollywood celebrity, coast to coast sold out every CD
Lovin' every minute of it

Oh, wouldn't you want that too?
Who could blame you?
Oh, 'cause what I say is true, oh yeah

When you're a VIP you get whatever you please
What's Not To Like?
The fans screaming your name, all the fortune and fame
What's Not To Like?

You party all the time, you get to live the life
What's not to, what's not, What's Not To Like?

Signing pictures to the end of the line, smiling every time
The song you want I'm here to sing, it feels good, gotta bring it
Videos, my shows then the starring movie roles
What's Not To Like? oh, oh, oh, oh

When you're a VIP you get whatever you please
What's Not To Like?
The fans screaming your name, all the fortune and fame
Doesn't that sound nice?

You party all the time, you get to live the life
What's Not To Like?
When you're a superstar everyone knows who you are
What's not to, what's not, What's Not To Like?
