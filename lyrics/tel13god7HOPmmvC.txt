I was so scared
You were what I feared
And though I never dared
With you I somehow did

I was alone
I was alone

You saw me there
Lying naked on the floor again
Thinking of her
How it was with her back then

I know
Now I know

What I found
Was a castle on the cloud

Cause you took me there
And lay me on a broken bed
No air
And there
Were cobwebs
Falling in my hair
I swear
I would have died for you

But you left me there
Then all the memories
Came crashing down
The insecurities
By which you're bound
But still
I would have died for you

I would have died for you

2:
You didn't know
It was so long ago
I never let go
You were a mine-field
But you were all mine
I thought you were mine

Then you were there
Filling up my eyes again
Knew I shouldn't care
Your beauty made me blind again
I tried

You were the finest fit I could find
Guess what I'd found
Was a castle on a cloud

Cause you took me there
And lay me on a broken bed
No air
And there
Were cobwebs
Falling in my hair
I swear
I would have died for you

But you left me there
Then all the memories
Came crashing down
The insecurities
By which you're bound
But still
I would have died for you

I would have died for you

Nothing's going to change
The way I feel about you now
Nothing's going to change
The way I feel about you now
Nothing's going to change
Anything
(Couldn't stop it if I tried)

But I want you to know
I know what went down
And did you even care?

Cause you lay me down
In a castle on a cloud

X2
Cause you took me there
And lay me on a broken bed
No air
And there
Were cobwebs
Falling in my hair
I swear
I would have died for you

But you left me there
Then all the memories
Came crashing down
The insecurities
By which you're bound
But still
I would have died for you
