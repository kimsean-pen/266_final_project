Amid the heat and the wrack
Hot boots invested and cracked
Poor candidates jacked into gray light
An ultra-violent call summoning both poet and thrall
Sweet catalyst for the acolytes

Our heroes and martyrs
Present two points of view
Tell me which deity you're praying to

Into a welter of night
Flack, rounds and roiling blight
Cracked vertebrates stacked by the wayside
An ultra-violent call summoning both poet and thrall
The inveterate blind seeking daylight

Our heroes and martyrs
Present two points of view
Tell me which deity you're praying to
