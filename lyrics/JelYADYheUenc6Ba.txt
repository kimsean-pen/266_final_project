I'm hypnotised
and helpless
Beneath the pale
full moon
My body is your sacrifice
You spirit's coming soon

I stare up at a
squalid night

It's been so cold
and smooth
Turns tender kisses
into bites
As you begin to move

You look so weak
and fragile
You seem to drip
and sway
But you swept me up into
your arms
And carried me away

I'm living bad dreams
I can't run from you
I'm living bad dreams
This nightmare's
coming true

You led me to temptation
Delivered me to pain
I walked upon you
hallowed ground
My soul is yours to gain

Your passion drains
my energy
Fear starts running deep
I'm falling in
slow motion
Into eternal sleep

I'm living bad dreams
I can't run from you
I'm living bad dreams
This nightmare's
coming true

Your passion drains
my energy
Fear starts running deep
I'm falling in
slow motion
Into eternal sleep
I'm living bad dreams

I can't run from you
I'm living bad dreams
There's nothing
I can do

I'm living bad dreams
I can't run from you
I'm living bad dreams
This nightmare's
coming true

I'm living bad dreams
ohh ohh
I don't want bad dreams
Living bad dreams
