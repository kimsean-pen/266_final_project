Sunday morning I wake up,
You're beside me, breathing so loud.
The wall is empty and so flat,
the world around me is too large. Oh.

And I know that I'm slow in the morning.
As I fall into a hole,
and on and on until,
Silently, I look at you
and all the mirrors
vanish from my mind.

Oh, oh whoa oh-oh uh-oh
Oh, oh whoa oh-oh uh-oh
You're mine.

Oh, oh whoa oh-oh uh-oh
Oh, oh whoa oh-oh uh-oh
You're mine.
