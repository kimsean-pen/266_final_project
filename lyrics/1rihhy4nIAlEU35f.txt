These new lines on my face
Spell out "girl pick up your pace,
If you want to stay true to what your younger self would do"

And this kink in my walk
Makes me focus when I talk
If I can't trust my feet,
Then it's my tongue I choose to keep

And I walk slow so I can read
Let my head fall, my hips lead
Why'd you write the words so small?
Did you fool me, are they words at all?

Or are you pulling down the veil
Keeping grounded as you set my sail?
By the time I pull it off
All my innocence is lost

And oh I'm good, I think I'm good
Will I be great, will I be great?
Is it money I wanna make or is it sweet love
For his sake?

And these new parts I now need
To help me function, help me feed
They are beyond my modest earnings
Oh the girls they keep turning up the heat
As if it's cold
But I'm hot, too hot to hold
I'll burn a hole right through the hull

When will I
Ever see the land?
Will I ever see the land?
Oh water can't revive me
I need dirt in my hand
Will I ever see the land?
Will I ever see the land?
Oh the ground will give me something
I know that it can

See I have charm and I have sight
And I always try and do what's right
But I have faults you know it's true
Especially when it comes to treating you well

I will work when all my thoughts are mine again
See I was sure at the start, turns out I tried too hard
And oh I'm good, I think I'm good
Will I be great, will I be great?
Is it money I wanna make or is it sweet love
For his sake?

When will I
Ever see the land?
Will I ever see the land?
Oh water can't revive me
I need dirt in my hand
Will I ever see the land?
Will I ever see the land?
Oh the ground will give me something
I know that it can
