You whisper, I scream
Knowing the people I could be but
If you'd listen, when I speak
You'd know I'm no girl from a dream and I should be but

I could never do for you the favors of a girl who's not broken
I could never play the role, I'm only playing games with your mind

For tonight I
I'm doing all the favors
I'm doing all the favors you like
Close your eyes tight
I'm gonna be creative
I'm doing all the favors you like

You glimmer, I gleam
Knowing the ways that I could bleed but
If you're with me, you'll see
All of the ways that I'm empty, I could be more but

I could never do for you the favors of a girl who's not broken
I could never play the role, I'm only playing games with your mind

For tonight I
I'm doing all the favors
I'm doing all the favors you like
Close your eyes tight
I'm gonna be creative
I'm doing all the favors you like

For tonight I
I'm doing all the favors
I'm doing all the favors you like
Close your eyes tight
I'm gonna be creative
I'm doing all the favors you like
For tonight I
I'm doing all the favors
I'm doing all the favors you like
Close your eyes tight
I'm gonna be creative
I'm doing all the favors you like
