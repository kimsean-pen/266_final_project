You'll never sleep again

I heard a crash from the bedroom upstairs
You're screaming out my name
I open the door and know our lives will never be the same
She lays in tears, he's standing there
Climbed through the window and fled; another life left in ruin

This can't be one more shot to the throat of innocence
A memory best left forgotten
This is the poison of truth
You took something perfect and you just had to destroy it

Hang, bleed, I want you suffering!
Nails deep within your skin!
I live to see you rot for this!
I'll make you beg, I'll make you beg!

You'll suffer at my hand
Broken bones and slit wrists, pray for distance
You won't forget this name as long as you live
Make your peace with a god that will turn his back for just one night
Throw you to the slaughter with a whimpered goodbye
Yeah!

Do you keep a body count
Of the lives you've destroyed?
You cover up the screams
But can't escape her voice

Hang, bleed, I want you suffering!
Nails deep within your skin!
I live to see you rot for this!
I'll make you beg, I'll make you beg!

You're such a waste of life, burn from the inside
When you meet death, he'll be your only friend
You're such a waste of life, burn from the inside
When you wake up in hell, you'll never sleep again

I'd throw you off that bed
Break your ribs with my fists
I'll fucking show you the mess
You'll get the nightmare that you deserve
You'll never sleep again
You'll never sleep again
