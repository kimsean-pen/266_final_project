Hey, I see you working it
I see you strutting down the street. You look important huh?
I walk the other way, I don't wanna bother you with my sobriety
We used to share the summer nights riding our stolen bikes
But now I don't interest you, I'm like a blog from 1999

I only see you when you're walking, walking to somewhere
You're so restless, what can be over there?
I only see you when you're walking, walking to somewhere
you're so restles, it must be special there

And the next night I see you sitting over there with girl #115
Your fashion caught her eye? Another conquest of your personality
I've tried to indicate that she could be someone for me
But even weekend I see you walking with her quarter to 3

I only see you when you're walking, walking to somewhere
You're so restless, what can be over there?
I only see you when you're walking, walking to somewhere
you're so restles, it must be special there

I just want to conversate with you but you keep on talking to your phone

You're so restless, you're gonna end up alone.
I only see you when you're walking, walking to somewhere
You're so restless, what can be over there?
I only see you when you're walking, walking to somewhere
you're so restles, it must be special there
