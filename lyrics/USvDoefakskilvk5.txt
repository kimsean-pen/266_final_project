Yo Doctor C
When you gonna write that script for me?
And where the rest of she?
Bite the hand that write the recipe
No way y'all do
Spite the man that fight for you
Despite the man that fight for you

I can't wait till you want it too
You knew just what you got into
I've been aching to follow you
I've been aching to follow you

You could be mine
Taking my time and waiting for the first sign
Picking a side and you can't decide
And landing on a thin line

Depends upon, what you decide to spend it on
To fix the knots, you could not connect the dots
I know you're into it, but you don't want to wait long
And you might want to be alone

I can't wait till you want it too
You knew just what you got into
I've been aching to follow you
I've been aching to follow you

Waiting for the first sign
That you could be mine and taking my time
And landing on a thin line
Picking a side, you can decide
You can decide

I can't wait till you want it too
You knew just what you got into
I've been aching to follow you
I've been aching to follow you

Taking my time and waiting for the first sign
Picking a side and you can't decide
And landing on a thin line
Waiting for the first sign
That you could be mine and taking my time
And landing on a thin line
Picking a side, you can decide
You can decide
