Darling, you wish you were red
You don't know you're falling in love, or are you still alive?

Darling, revolution won't stand
You're a Judas that's hiding in red, why are you still going?

It pays to say those words that all stop trying
But baby don't cry
Oh my darling, you're a dying red star

Darling, you wish you were red
You don't know you're falling in love, or are you still alive?

Darling, revolution won't stand
You're a Judas that's hiding in red, why are you still going?

It pays to say those words that all stop trying
But baby don't cry
Oh my darling, you're a dying red star
