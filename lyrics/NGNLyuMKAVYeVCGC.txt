Asked a girl What she wanted to be
She said "Baby, can't you see
I wanna be famous, a star on the screen
But you can do something in between"

Baby, You can Drive My Car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can Drive My Car
And maybe I love you

I told a girl that my prospects were good
And she said "Baby, it's understood
Working for peanuts is all very fine
But I can show you a better time"

Baby, You can Drive My Car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, You can Drive My Car
And maybe I love you
(Beep, beep, beep, beep Yeah!)

Baby, You can Drive My Car
Yes I'm gonna be a star
Baby, You can Drive My Car
And maybe I love you

I told that girl I can start right away
And she said, "Listen baby I got something to say
I got no car and it's breaking my heart
But I've found a driver and that's a start"

Baby, You can Drive My Car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, You can Drive My Car
And maybe I love you
(Beep, beep, beep, beep Yeah!)
(Beep, beep, beep, beep Yeah!)
(Beep, beep, beep, beep Yeah!)
(Beep, beep, beep, beep Yeah!)
