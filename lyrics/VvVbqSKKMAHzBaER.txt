This could be Heaven
This could be Heaven
This could be Heaven
This could be Heaven
This could be Heaven for everyone
This could be Heaven
This could be Heaven
This could be Heaven
This could be Heaven for everyone

In these days of cool reflection (reflection)
You come to me and everything seems alright
In these days of cold affections
You sit by me and everything's fine

This could be Heaven for everyone
This world could be fed
This world could be fun
This could be Heaven for everyone
This world could be free
This world could be one

In this world of cool deception
Just your smile can smooth my ride
These troubled days of cruel rejection
You come to me, soothe my troubled mind

Yeah, this could be Heaven for everyone
This world could be fed
This world could be fun
This should be love for everyone (yeah)
This world should be free
This world could be one

We should bring love to our daughters and sons
Love, love, love, love
(This could be Heaven for everyone)
You know that
(This could be Heaven for everyone)
Yes, ha-ha-ha-ha
(This could be Heaven for everyone)
Yeah
(This could be Heaven for everyone)

Listen
What people do to other souls
They take their lives, destroy their goals
Their basic pride and dignity
Is stripped and torn and shown no pity
When this should be Heaven for everyone

This could be Heaven
This could be Heaven
This could be Heaven for everyone
This could be Heaven
Could be Heaven for everyone

This could be Heaven
(This could be Heaven)
This could be Heaven
Could be Heaven for everyone

This could be Heaven
(This could be Heaven)
This could be Heaven
Could be Heaven for everyone

This could be Heaven
This could be Heaven
Could be Heaven for everyone

This could be Heaven
This could be Heaven
This could be Heaven
This could be Heaven
This could be Heaven
This could be Heaven
This could be Heaven
This could be Heaven
This could be Heaven

For everyone
For everyone
