Klytus, I'm bored. What play thing can you offer me today?

An obscure body in the S-K System, your majesty. The inhabitants refer to it as the planet Earth.

How peaceful it looks.

So make gardens, and eat the fruit of them, then...
And they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
And I will plant them upon their land, which I have given them, your God.
And the mountains shall drop sweet wine and the hills shall melt.
And the mountains shall drop sweet wine and the hills shall melt.
And the mountains shall drop sweet wine and the hills shall melt.
And they shall build the waste cities and live in them.
And they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine of them.
And live in them.
And they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine of them.

And the mountains shall drop sweet wine and the hills shall melt.
And the treader of grapes shall overtake him who soweth seed.
And the mountains shall drop sweet wine and the hills shall melt.
And they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine of them.
