We want it all, addressing higher birds
I think we should have been a trinity
We want it all, addressing higher birds
I think you should have been a bird in me

Hey, let's watch the moon
It's leaving soon, let's sing its tune
Hey, how long a flight
We steal tonight this mournful sight

We want it all (to glow under this night sky), addressing higher birds
I think we should have been a trinity
I think you should have been a bird in me

All these scenarios under the moon
All the intrusions of sight
This exhibition I've dreamed in the gutter for so long
All these scenarios under the moon
All these confusions we find
My definitions have been in the gutter for too long
