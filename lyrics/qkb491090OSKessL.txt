Sick yellow piston, I'm on a mission
Reach for the heat and get burnt by the bomb
Blast off the booster seat, I'm on the team to beat
They better fall to knees, where I'm from
Stardust boys generate the thunder
We intergalactic why they wonder
Three Ones stole the game by surprise
Glide 'round the Inner West on my spaceship
4 door Subaru when they race it
Froze so quick, put 10 to this face
Red silk on my wrist, gram in my fist
Lonely they follow into the abyss
Get wetter for me, better for me
The general quick to get lost in a spree
"Picnic Hanging Rock" out my pocket
Not enough time to reset the rocket
Hang with the kings and your gonna get king hits
See F.T.W. flew off astral plane shit
You can't be me I'm a rap star
I'm mobbin' out the back of a black car
Black kicks, black cap, black track-style
Head-bangin' till I break, Marty go wild
Yellow nuts they drop to pavement
You better run and get my payment
We do not fuck with Layman
This is my final statement
Blade on my heart
Don't lock me up in my craft
They can not hold me down from on Mars
I cannot cry for you when I'm always broken
We do not provide violence here
Yap a lot, you meet silence here
Mollydooker got the cream and sugar
I'ma perfect cooker it's a science dear

Halo, Halo, But you were so off
(Because you want me to be it)
And you a showoff
(Whenever you despise me I be it)
Halo, Halo, But you were so off
(Because you want me to be it)
And you a showoff
(Whenever you despise me I be it)

Take apart my self, inside I'm righteous
Close ya legs, ya lips are looking priceless
Bitches loving blow inside her sinus
Bitches hot and cold just like the climate
This is feelin' wrong but I could try it
You just mute your phone without an eyelid
I got shivers down my neck excited
Taking off the strip just like a pilot
Cry me to sleep I got a bag dreams
with no strings 'cause they paid for
Inside a sheet ya eyes won't release, we touched hip what a dam shame
Kiss my lip I'm on finger tip, egg shells on the ice what a hot mess
Double back just to hit the mack she
want me to get beat like I'm dead meat
So who's to say if I confine inside myself
Or who's to say it's only relevant when notches on the belt
Evident my conversation get to something else
'Cause when it round the circle oculating gets to someone else
So fuck you I won't hold my lip
I got the devil on the telly, but remote won't flick
It's liking led inside the belly, but the bozo's thick
And if she hit me on the celly think my phone don't itch
It's like...

Halo, Halo, But you were so off
(Because you want me to be it)
And you a showoff
(Whenever you despise me I be it)
Halo, Halo, But you were so off
(Because you want me to be it)
And you a showoff
(Whenever you despise me I be it)
