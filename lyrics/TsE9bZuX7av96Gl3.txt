Time to let you go

I've been patient about this before
But I'm finding the courage to get out
Pack my things and go
You don't ask me how I feel anymore
Am I just a figure in your background?
It's time to let you know

That you just break me
Like I'm your enemy
You keep on taking
But I don't owe nothing
Don't owe you nothing

But I
Imma stay here all night
Talk in circles and fight to let you know
That I
I don't wanna be right
Cause I know that it's time to let you go
Time to let you go

Time to let you go
Time to let you go

I wish you were someone I could change
But we both know that it's in your nature
To hurt and never know
I will miss all the things that you said
Making me forget what I deserve
What I deserve

Cause you just break me
Like I'm your enemy
You keep on taking
But I don't owe nothing
Don't owe you nothing

I, Imma stay here all night
Talk in circles and fight to let you know
That I
I don't wanna be right
Cause I know that it's time to let you go
Time to let you go

Time to let you go
Time to let you go

Break me
Taking
But I don't owe nothing
Don't owe you nothing
But I
Imma stay here all night
Talk in circles and fight to let you know
That I
I don't wanna be right
Cause I know that it's time to let you go
Time to let you go

Time to let you go
Time to let you go
