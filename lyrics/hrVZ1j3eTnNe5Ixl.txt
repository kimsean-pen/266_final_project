I thought it was too good to be true
I found somebody who understands me
Someone who would help me to get through
And fill an emptiness I had inside me

But you kept inside and I just denied
Some things that we should have both said
I knew it was too good to be true
'Cause I'm the only one who understands me

What happened to us?
We used to be so perfect
Now we're lost and lonely

What happened to us?
And deep inside I wonder
Did I lose my only?

Remember they thought we were too young
To really know what it takes to make it
But we had survived off what we have done

So we could show them all that they're mistaken
But who could have known
The lies that would grow

Until we could see right through them
Remember they knew we were too young
We still don't know what it takes to make it

What happened to us?
We used to be so perfect
Now we're lost and lonely

What happened to us?
And deep inside I wonder
Did I lose my only one?

We could've made it work
We could've found a way
We should've done our best to see another day

But we kept it all inside until it was too late and now we're both alone
The consequence we pay for throwing it all away
For throwing it all away

What happened to us?
We used to be so perfect
Now we're lost and lonely

What happened to us?
And deep inside I wonder
Did I lose my only?

What happened to us?
What happened to us?
What happened to us?
What happened to us?
