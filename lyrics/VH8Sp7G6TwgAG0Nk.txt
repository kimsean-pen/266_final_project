Must I get a witness for all this misery?
There's no need to, brothers
Everybody can see

That it's one more time in the ghetto
One more time, if you please
One more time to the dying man
One more time to be free

One more time in the ghetto
One more time to be free (push)
One more time in the ghetto (altogether)
One more time to be free (push)

The old lady kicks Karate
For just a little walk down the street
The little baby knows Kung Fu
He tries it on those he meets

Cause it's one more time in the ghetto
One more time, if you please now
One more time to the dying man
They say, one more time, if you please

One more time in the ghetto
One more time to be free
One more time in the ghetto
One more time to be free

One more time
one more time in the ghetto
One more time, if you please now
One more time to the dying man
One more time to be free

One more time in the ghetto
One more time to be free
One more time in the ghetto
One more time to be free

You don't need no silicone to calculate poverty
Watch when Watts town burns again
The bus goes to Montgomery

It's a one more time in the ghetto, you know
One more time, yeah
One more time to the dying man
One more time, if you please now

One more time
One more time
One more time

If you can remember
The days of long ago
You'll get yours
