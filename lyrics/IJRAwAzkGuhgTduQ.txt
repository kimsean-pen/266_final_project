Is there anybody here
Who hears me crying?
I'm dying.
Is there anybody here
When it's over
Over?

I'm just passing the time.
Wondering how you
People will ever survive.

Whoring down your whoring streets
Killing you while you're killing me.
It's time
To show all you people you'll never survive
Whoring down your whoring streets
Killing you while you're killing me.

Is there anybody here
Who hears me crying?
I'm dying.
Is there anybody here

Killing you while you're killing me.
Whoring down your whoring streets
Killing you while you're killing me.
