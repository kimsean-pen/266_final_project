What's it gonna take for a guy like me to find a girl like you?
What I gotta do to find a girl who's loving is more than true?
No one can play the game alone even if you try to
Baby, I'm yours now
Dreaming a connection
I can meet you downtown
I'll take you where you wanna be tonight

Too much talking around
I can see how this happened
Using up all the lifelines
Tryna turn up decent
You've got plenty of time
I can see you walked over
What you see isn't in my mind
Don't believe we've met before
I'm out to playing quiet, smiling, without thought
'Cause my wind's been turned insideout
Been gone quite a while

What's it gonna take for a guy like me to find a girl like you?
What I gotta do to find a girl who's loving is more than true?
No one can play the game alone, even if you try to
Baby, I'm yours now
Dreaming a connection
I can meet you downtown
I'll take you where you wanna be tonight

Aren't you gonna stay?
Keep me 'til the Sun comes up
Crack a Pellegrino
From the bottle no cup
That was summer love, that was summer love
Late night, cemetery
Think there's still a light out
Temporary love in sight now
Love is scary baby look out

What's it gonna take for a guy like me to find a girl like you?
What I gotta do to find a girl who's loving is more than true?
No one can play the game alone, even if you try to
Baby, I'm yours now
Dreaming a connection
I can meet you downtown
I'll take you where you wanna be tonight
