A reason to live,
Reason to love.
You gave me them both and more;
Yet, a reason to fall
And a reason to hide
Suddenly all I'm left with...

I was so sure this was real, but
Now I'm sure of nothing at all.

I had to shatter to pieces,
You made me reveal myself, reveal myself.
So if you no longer need them,
Then give them to someone else.

Take what you gave,
And throw it away.
Now everything's changed, it's misplaced
Nothing to say, cuz' I'm not the same.
It's almost as if we just met.

I was so sure this was real but,
Now I'm sure of nothing at all.

I had to shatter to pieces,
You made me reveal myself, reveal myself.
Now that you no longer need them,
I'll give them to someone else.

It's illogical, I was nothing without you.
But you ought to know.
I was lost when I had found you.

I had to shatter to pieces,
Made me reveal myself, reveal myself.
Now that you no longer them, I'll give them someone else.
To someone else.

I had to shatter to pieces,
Made me reveal myself, reveal myself.
Now that you no longer them, I'll give them someone else.
To someone else.
