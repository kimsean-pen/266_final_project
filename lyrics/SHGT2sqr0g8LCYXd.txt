Separate me from what creates balance
To deserve to be let down
What soaks up and sobers?
The prison of twilight
Peace will not absolve this

Cut these cords
Let it unravel
Let it flood through every floor
Teach me a lesson
Build upon my disgrace
The unbearable flaws of it all

Torrents crash without warning
Unlatch from the notion that this is binding
Figments strike out in passing
To be parched always eternally

Here lies what we've feared
Just let it pass
Take cover from the all-seeing sun
Bewitched by the glare
Let it wash over you
