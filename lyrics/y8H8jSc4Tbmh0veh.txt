I can hear you when I wake
I can see you when I dream
I can feel you when I break
As you hold me as you beam
Every night you fill the sky with new revelations
Misty moon I'm your loon
Let's rock the nation

Heaven knows we are
Made perfect we are
Tailored by the stars
Once we set our mind
We become divine
Take my hand it's time

I cross my heart
I tear down the firewalls
I cross my heart
I'm stronger than cannonballs
I'll never sto-o-o-o-op
Luna moon me up, to the top
And I'll never sto-o-o-o-op
Luna moon me up, to the top

If you're stuck in all the noise
Let me be your secret voice
If you think that you don't count
Let me prove you different now

Heaven knows we are
Made perfect we are
Tailored by the stars
Once we set our mind
We become divine
Take my hand it's time

I cross my heart
I tear down the firewalls
I cross my heart
I'm stronger than cannonballs
I'll never sto-o-o-o-op
Luna moon me up, to the top
And I'll never sto-o-o-o-op
Luna moon me up, to the top

I cross my heart
I tear down the firewalls
I cross my heart
I'm stronger than cannonballs
I'll never sto-o-o-o-op
Luna moon me up, to the top
And I'll never sto-o-o-o-op
Luna moon me up, to the top
I cross my heart
