Before you go throw it all away
She's (??) to what I say
Don't end your life, there's so much to see
If you have to run you'll never be free

Take my hand before you fall apart
And I promise that you'll never be alone
Take my hand before you fall apart
And I promise that you'll never be alone
Again

Suppose (??) window, stop your crying
I know it's worse with every sign
You feel like a (?) for you to do
You saved the whole world (??????)
I tell you but (??)

Take my hand before you fall apart
And I promise that you'll never be alone
Take my hand before you fall apart
And I promise that you'll never feel alone
Don't fall back

Take my hand before you fall apart
And I promise that you'll never be alone
Take my hand before you fall apart
And I promise that you'll never be alone
Again
