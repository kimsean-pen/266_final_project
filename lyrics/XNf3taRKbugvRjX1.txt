Went to my doctor yesterday
Aaaah
She said I seem to be OK
Aaaah
She said Paul, you better look around
How long you think that you can run that body down
How many nights you think
That you can do what you been doing
Who, now who you foolin'
I came back home and I went to bed
I was resting my head
My wife came in and she said what's wrong
Sweet boy, what's wrong
I told her what's wrong
I said Peg, you better look around
How long you think that you can run that body down
How many nights you think that you can do
What you been doing
Who, now who you foolin'
Who you foolin'
Who you foolin'
Wuo yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh
I said yeh eh eh eh eh

Kids you better look around
How long you think that you can run that body down
How many nights you think that you can do
What you been doing
Who, now who you foolin'
Who you foolin'
Who you foolin'
Who you foolin'
Who you foolin'
