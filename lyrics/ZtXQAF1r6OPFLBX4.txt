The right side's in the wrong
And what's left's just holding on
And the public has been privatized
But I believe in something here on earth

When did the punks stop being mad?
They penned love songs 'bout we got had
The hippies sold out traded pot for coke
Moved to the 'burbs found God in a vote

But I believe in something here on earth
Listen, just dance like you're disappointed in the world
Just dance, just dance
Just dance, just dance, just dance miserable

Just dance like you're disappointed in the world
I believe in something here on earth

Sorry Hank, there's room in here
Had squares in the oval for about eight years
It's as bad as I remember and it's only getting worse
It only gets better when it hurts, I still believe in something here on earth

Just dance like you're disappointed in the world
Just dance, just dance
Just dance, just dance, just dance miserable
Just dance like you're disappointed in the world

Unemployed? Foreclosed? Uninsured? Climate change?
Depressed? Depressed? The decline of western civilization
Dance, dance, just dance like you're disappointed in the world
Just dance, just dance, just dance, just dance, just dance miserable
Just dance like you're disappointed in the world
Just dance, just dance, just dance, just dance, just dance miserable
