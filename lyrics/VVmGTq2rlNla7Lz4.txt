I'm doing my time around
doing my time around
doing my time around
doing my time
the punishment don't fit the crime
I'm doing my time around
doing my time around
If somebody told you
this isn't the kind of place
you want to end in all they begin
Go take my breath away
see you on the other side
closer to suicide
or is it just me
Oh lets just spil it out and under
building up like thunder
perheps this is what real emotion does to me
I'm doing my time around
doing my time around
doing my time around
doing my time
the punishment don't fit the crime
I'm doing my time around
doing my time around
You kick it like you wanna know
more than you wanna know
find out better I'd give you all I've got
now all that I can say
Let's go our seperate ways
go on pretend I've never got out of the way
yeah
yeah
I'm doing my time around
doing my time around
doing my time around
doing my time
the punishment don't fit the crime
I'm doing my time around
doing my time around
so tell me do you too still suffer from the low all the way up to the top
it's a lot
when you're under it
oh tell me do you too still suffer from the low all the way up to the top
it's a lot
when you're under it
You never??? the same mistakes
again, again, again, again
what made you dance for me
