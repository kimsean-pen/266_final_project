Die for Christ
Die for Allah
Die for Jerusalem
Die for Torah

Father and son marching in rhythm
Firing bullets through the skulls of the children

Holy war
Mortars and martyrs
Holy war
Unholy followers
Holy war
Brainwashed with death
Holy war
Unholy mess

I reject the laws of the misguided
False prophets imprison nations fueling self annihilation
I reject pocket lined political demons
Who arm the ignorant for election season

Empires buried in sand
A history of the failures in man

Armies of guardians
Servants of Bibles
Reciting verses as they stand before rifles
Millions of lives erased
Hatred marked as madness
Violence in leaves of scripture
A world aflame with malice

We will all die for nothing
There is silence in the house of God
There is only the cry of Hell
There is silence in the house of God
There is only the cry of Hell

Holy war
Mortars and martyrs
Holy war
Unholy followers
Holy war
Brainwashed with death
Holy war
Unholy mess

Die for Christ
Die for Allah
Die for Jerusalem
Die for Torah

Father and son marching in rhythm
Firing bullets through the skulls of the children

Holy war
Holy war

We will all die for nothing
We will all die for nothing
