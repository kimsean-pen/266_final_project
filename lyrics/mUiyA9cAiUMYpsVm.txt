I'll write you a song and it won't be hard to sing
It will be a natural anthem, familiar it may seem
It will rally all the workers on strike for better pay
And its chorus will resound and boost morale throughout the day

I'll write you a song and I hope that you won't mind
Because all the names and places, I have taken from real life
So please, don't be upset at this portrait that I paint
It may be a little biased but at least I spelt your name right
