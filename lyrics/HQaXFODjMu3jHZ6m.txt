'Cause I'm afraid to miss you
Although I was sad already
Keep telling myself what I want with you
Who should know about how we do?
Don't say my name with respect
Quit telling your friends that you work with me
Let me tune in into your frequency that you sent
Now that you lit my fire
Don't let me go, go alone

'Cause I'm afraid to miss you
Although one was sad, awaiting
Kept telling myself that I want with you
Who should know about how we do?
Don't say my name with respect
Quit telling your friends that you work for me
Let me tune in into your frequency that you sent
Now that you lit my fire
Don't let me go, go alone
