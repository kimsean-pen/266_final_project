I would like to do
Something for you
You want me to

She's just the same
She likes to play
I'll hide kisses in your hair

Don't feel ashamed
You're not to blame
It's just a game

But just the same
What would they say?
Baby angel on my knee
(Baby angel on my)

Lips are sealed
Lips are sealed
Lips are sealed

Come, sit with me
Slide on my knee
Sing just for me
And for a while
I'll make you smile

Baby angel on my knee
(Baby angel on my)
I know what you want from me
(I know what you want from me)

I'll make you smile
I'll make you smile
I'll make you smile

Outside she's listening
To laughter and whispering
But she won't say
Nothing to him, see

She's just the same
She's just the same
She's just the same
