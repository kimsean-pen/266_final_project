Annihilate, accelerate, surge into cold pristine state
Invisible radiation, everlasting desecration
Profane sun, pervading light, splendor burst to virgin dust
Revelation, restitution, a riven covenant

Arise nocturnal star, into the void of eternal light
From brume into renascence, emergent evolution
Perennial aeonic divine eclipse

Arise - light of shining bliss
Divine - night in cosmic abyss
Devastate, discreate, putrefied and liquefied
Separation, isolation, final dissolution
Celestial spheres, a pallid flame, repulsive procreation
Manifestation, adumbration, luminous in radiance

Arise celestial bliss, into the void of divine essence
As a swarm into renascence, emergent evolution
Concentric primordial subsistence reborn

Arise - light of shining bliss
Divine - night in cosmic abyss

Recreate, generate, turning into supreme black light
Ethereal abomination, artificial entity
Profane sun, pervading light, splendor burst to virgin dust
Revelation, restitution a riven covenant - arise
