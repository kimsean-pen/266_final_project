Baby, we used to drive in your car
What happened to us?
Yeah, we didn't make it very far
I never though that we would end up like this
Until you gave me your last kiss
We slept on the floor all night
I fell in love with you as the seconds went by
Can you tell me just what changed your mind?

'Cause you were obsessed with me like we were 17
And you struggled to keep your hands off me
But now look at us now
Somehow we drowned

I just want you one more time
I just want you one more time
Won't you just give me one last night?
With you, with you

It's been three months now, can we talk it out?
How you left me standing outside the front of your house
Saw you through the window crying on the stairs
I thought you didn't care

I just wanna pull you close
But there's walls in-between
Can't we just go back to when we were 17?

I just want you one more time
I just want you one more time
Won't you give me one last night?
With you, with you

I lie awake and think how we used to be, we used to be
And you'd do all the little things that make me weak
They made me weak

I just want you one more time
I just want you one more time
Won't you give me one last night with you?

I just want you one more time
I just want you one more time
Won't you give me one last night?
With you, with you
I just want you one more time
I just want you one more time
Won't you give me one last night?
With you, with you
