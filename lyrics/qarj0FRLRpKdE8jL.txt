Sometimes I wanna walk, I wanna walk
I wanna run away, run away

I tell myself that no one else can help me
And I need esteem, it's okay

I'm being dramatic but if I sit static, it should start to fade
Then he came

Trouble follows you (if you run, no matter where)
Trouble follows you (if you run, no matter where)
Trouble follows you (if you run, no matter where)
Trouble follows you

Sometimes I wanna walk, I wanna walk
I wanna run away, run away

I'm being dramatic but if I sit static, it should start to fade
Then he came

Trouble follows you (if you run, no matter where)
Trouble follows you (if you run, no matter where)
Trouble follows you (if you run, no matter where)
Trouble follows you
