Waves of insanity touching her skin as the colors descends in thunder
Woken up from their wandering, lost within their slumber
Dedication can now begin as she digs deep in her hole
Nobody knows what she knows as she walks the trails it shows

And oh look at the sky and a million fireflies

Dead are the woods where they're singing their songs of old forgotten greatness
She'll listen up, she'll hear them sigh, begging for forgiveness
Holding on to what she's got still grabbing what is yours
Nobody knows what she knows as she walks the trails it shows

And oh look at the night and all those crimson red bright lights
And oh look at the sky and a million fireflies

The war of young and old
As the winter held us cold
An eye just for an eye
Under a million fireflies

Go on, rise above the meadow, rise
Go on, rise above the meadow, rise

And oh look at the night and all those crimson red bright lights
And oh look at the sky and a million fireflies
And oh look at the night and all those crimson red bright lights
And oh look at the sky and a million fireflies
