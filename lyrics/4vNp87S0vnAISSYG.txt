I burned all the bridges behind me
Can't tell you the truth so I lie
I'm waving at someone behind you
I filter my eyes when I look to the sky

[Chorus:]
Time to lose
Tell them everything
Say I lost my light
Your word means everything
I cannot say it right
Time to lose
Tell them everything
Say I lost my light
I withdrew
Lost my everything
My vision is unclear

I burned all the bridges behind me
Can't tell you the truth so I lie
I'm waving at someone behind you
I filter my eyes when I look to the sky

(Chorus)

Wait for me outside
Will you hold on
Can you hold on

I'm waving at someone behind you
I filter my eyes when I look to the sky

(Chorus)
