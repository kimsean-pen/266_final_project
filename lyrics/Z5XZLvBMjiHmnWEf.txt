How does it feel to feel?
You know it's for real
Don't say what died
You know it's alive

I watch from reel to real
Don't see what I feel
Split open wide
A wash in the tide

The beach seems surreal
Depends how you feel
The sea stretched for miles
I drove all the while

You ask what I feel
I still feel surreal
Taken for a ride
And bleeding inside

How does it feel?
You know it's for real
Split open wide

How does it feel to feel?
You know it's for real
The sea stretched for miles
I drove all the while

Don't see what I feel
Don't see what I feel
Don't see what I feel
Don't see what I feel
