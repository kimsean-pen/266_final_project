A moment of independence
You turn up unannounced at my door step
I'm not letting you in, 'cause I don't know where you've been
But then again, you think you know me well

The minute I slip out of your grip, you want it all again
The thought of the sight of you does things to me that I can't explain

And you're pulling me in, slow time
Got a whole lot of enough to act like this
Taking me for a ride to where I've been before
You're not fooling me once again, 'cause I know that I deserve better
Won't you pack up and let me mend, 'cause I'm ready to stop feeling like this

You're crawling back to me, but I won't let myself give in
You're crawling back to me, but I won't let myself give in

Comfortable conversation, takes me back to the places
And all too soon you're lying next to me, and I'm okay with it
But I know I shouldn't be

The minute I slip out of your grip, you want it all again
The thought of the sight of you does things to me that I can't explain

And you're pulling me in, slow time
Got a whole lot of enough to act like this
Taking me for a ride to where I've been before
You're not fooling me once again, 'cause I know that I deserve better
Won't you pack up and let me mend
'Cause I'm ready to stop feeling like this

You're crawling back to me, but I won't let myself give in
You're crawling back to me, but I won't let myself give in

Isn't hindsight an interesting truth?
Why the fuck was I ever with you?
Seeing clearer than ever before
It's the last time you walk out my door

You're not pulling me in tonight
Got a whole lot of enough to act like this
Taking all this shit, goodbye
You're not welcome anymore
You're not fooling me once again, I always knew that I deserved better
Won't you pack up and let me mend
'Cause I'm ready to stop feeling like this

You're crawling back to me, but I won't let myself give in
You're crawling back to me, but I won't let myself give in
