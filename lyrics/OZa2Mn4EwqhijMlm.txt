I forgot the way, time
For talking back and letting you choose
Can I grow? Can I leave it alone?
I'm thinking that I want you too

I can't lie, I have my father's eyes
Hey young lonely, hey young lonely
Is it all okay? You'll find out you are strong
Hey young lonely, hey young lonely
Is it all okay? You'll find out you are strong

If I'm wrong have me dead in my head and dead in my home
But I can't remember what it is (what it is...) about you (about youâ€¦)
Checking the heart and checkin' into my hope. Watching the lines when I'm blood sucking with you

I can't lie, I have my father's eyes

Hey young lonely, hey young lonely
Is it all okay? You'll find out you are strong
Hey young lonely, hey young lonely
Is it all okay? You'll find out you are strong

Make me a martyr, make me a martyr
Make me a martyr, make me...

Hey young lonely, hey young lonely
Is it all okay? You'll find out you are strong
Hey young lonely, hey young lonely
Is it all okay? You'll find out you are strong

Make me a martyr, make me a martyr (You'll find out you are strong)
You'll find out you are strong
