Just close your eyes... can you remember
The generations not so long ago
I feel the shameless urge that we must restore
Our former king to his rightful throne
And with me lords and maidens
We wait for the chosen son's return

I come alive
It's a time for celebration
Our will to restore
Make our past become the futre once more

Still he lives! 2000 years have passed
And still we're yearning for his return
We fulfill a wishful prohecy
And so the chanting begins
Hail Caesar... Hail Caesar... we render unto you
What is still yours

Share the wish as it must be
Our king and palace... mode it be!
Gods enslaved, trators burning
Might and splendor forever return
