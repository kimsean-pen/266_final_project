Try
With a little bit of action
They don't build the world this way
It's alright

She lied
With the face of Cleopatra
The world ain't built this way
It's alright

Now
I'm gonna go outside
Nothings gonna save us
Nothings gonna save us
My only dope calypso
My only dope calypso
My only dope calypso
That's alright

Wise
Like three men they never got it
They'll keep death staring me down
I'm alright

Safe
So safe they never asked us
The world ain't built this way
It's alright

Now
I'm gonna go outside
Nothings gonna save us
Nothings gonna save us
My only dope calypso
My only dope calypso
My only dope calypso
That's alright

All I say is all I know and all I know is what you made me
My only dope calypso

It's over
In pieces
It's over
I'm alright
