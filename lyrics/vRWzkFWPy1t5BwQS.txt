It's springtime but I still miss the streets at dawn
And in the morning walking your bridges home
As I sit and stare at all of England's souls
I tell you something
I wish I was in Edinburgh
I don't mind being by myself
Don't wanta be anywhere else
Just wanna be in Edinburgh
I wish I was an Edinburgh man
You can leave me on the shelf
I'm an Edinburgh man myself
I will always give you help
It's summertime but I still miss your skies so clear
Sitting and staring on a beach somewhere
I'll tell you something
I wish I was in Edinburgh
Don't give a toss about private wealth
And history just repeats itself
Keep me away from the Festival
And just give me a warm quarter-gill*
They say you project yourself
But I'm an Edinburgh man myself
It's wintertime and i still see the cobble stones
Clacking over your streets at dawn
I was really poor since I left Edinburgh
I'm OK just by myself
Cause our miserable king won't protect us from ourselves
How I wish I was in Edinburgh
How I wish I was in Edinburgh
I was always in good health
I'm an Edinburgh man myself
I will always give you help
I'm an Edinburgh man myself
