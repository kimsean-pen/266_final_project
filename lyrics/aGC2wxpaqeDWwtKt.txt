They tell you where you need to go
Tell you when you need to leave
Tell you what you'll need to know
Tell you who you need to be

But everything inside you knows
There's more than what you've heard
So much more than empty conversations
Filled with empty words

And you're on fire
When he's near you
You're on fire
When he speaks
You're on fire
Burning at these mysteries

Give me one more time around
Give me one more chance to see
Give me everything you are
Give me one more chance to be near you

When everything inside me looks like
Everything I hate
You are the hope I have for change
You are the only chance I'll take

When I'm on fire
When you're near me
I'm on fire
When you speak
And I'm on fire
Burning at these mysteries
Mysteries
Mysteries

(You're on fire)
(You're on fire)
(You're on fire) I'm standing on the edge of me
I'm standing on the edge of me
I'm standing on the edge of me
I'm standing on the edge of me

I'm standing at the edge of everything I've never been before
And I've been standing at the edge of me
Standing on the edge

And I'm on fire
When you're near me
I'm on fire
When you speak
I'm on fire
Burning at these mysteries
These mysteries
These mysteries
Mysteries
You're a mystery
