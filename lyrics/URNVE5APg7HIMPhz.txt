Good day, you ladies and gents
The reign of imaginology begins
Who can say (who can say) where history begins?
It's gone...
'Shame on me', says peace officer
Fuck with me, fuck with her, live and learn
Open ears, corporate fears, golden years
Gone...
Destroy and rebuild
Destroy or be killed
Wipe me off this smear campaign
Carpet-mongering in the rain
Build it up (-tear it down), that's the game
WRONG
Destroy and rebuild
Destroy or be killed...
CREATING PANIC
IT'S AUTOMATIC
CREATING PANIC
IDIOPATHIC
CREATING PANIC...
(war bride)
(war bride)
Close your eyes and hold your tongues
Bondage-priest with a horse's lungs
In and out-(in and out)- can't you cum?
Gone...
A blinding super-power soon de-briefed
Declassified until it's breached
All smiles (all smiles) and no teeth
Wrong...
Unplanned parenthood
Eat shit and fuck good...
CREATING PANIC
IT'S AUTOMATIC
CREATING PANIC
IT'S PROPHYLACTIC
What revenge is there for living?
(CREATING PANIC)
From the floorboards to the top of the buildings
(IT'S AUTOMATIC)
Fear melts down the steel girders
(CREATING PANIC)
Tell me bitch, fuckin' how much further???
We are all terrorists and fags
And niggers and spics and fuckin' dirt-bags
Sketchy-cracker white trash
And we're coming
We comin' to get your ASS!!!
(IDIOPATHIC)
