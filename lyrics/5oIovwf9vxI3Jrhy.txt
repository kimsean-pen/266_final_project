And now, my heart, it sings suicide
And now, my gallow stain of black dye
And now, my death march brings tear to your eye
And now, the noose, it sways when you die

What a surprise
Whoa, what a surprise
What is the price?
What is the prize? Hey!

What a surprise
Whoa, what a surprise
What is the price?
What is the prize? Hey!

And now, my heart it splits when you dumb my eyes
And now, my gallow sinks of red dye
And now, the noose, it smiles when you lie
And now, my womb, it licks when you dig deep inside

What a surprise
Whoa, what a surprise
What is the price?
What is the prize? Hey!

What a surprise
Whoa, what a surprise
What is the price?
What is the prize? Hey!

Do you do it? Whoa, yeah
Do you feed it? Whoa, yeah, yeah
Do you sell it? Whoa, yeah
Do you need it? Whoa, yeah

In the sun, the willows give you shade
Oh hey, how they hang like a guillotine blade in the sun
In the sun, the willows give you shade
Oh yeah, how they hang like a guillotine blade in the sun
Like a blade in the sun
Like a blade...

What a surprise
Whoa, whoa, what a surprise, what a surprise, yeah
Whoa, whoa, what a surprise, what a surprise
Whoa, whoa, what a surprise, what a surprise
Whoa, whoa, what a surprise
