I forgot to call to you on your birthday
You swear you're the last thing on my mind, yeah
There is nothing I can do to fix it
All you ever asked me for was time

When the lights don't glow the same way that they use to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me you're in love with someone else

So can you do me a favor if I pull it together
Make it sooner than later, we won't be here forever
And I realize I waited to know
But please don't move on

You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else

You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
Every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go

When the lights don't glow the same way that they use to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me you're in love with someone else

So can you do me a favor if I pull it together
Make it sooner than later, we won't be here forever
And I realize I waited to know
But please don't move on

You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else

The girl or the world, you see someone gotta lose
I thought I could have it all, do I really gotta choose
What good is all the cash if it doesn't buy time
And what good is bein' famous if I'm never on your mind

Nights fallen, light glowing
And I'm just tryna pay the price owing
And I don't wanna feel the comfort from my ice showing
And I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments

Nigga, nice goin', is it worth it, that decision
'Cause hearts break and I ain't tryna be in that collision
So I'ma dust my shirt and fix my pants
'Cause I better look good, girl, if this my chance, I swear

So can you do me a favor if I pull it together
Make it sooner than later we won't be here forever
And I realize I waited to know
But please don't move on

You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else, oh
You don't need no one else
