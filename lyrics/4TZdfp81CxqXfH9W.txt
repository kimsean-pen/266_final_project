Picking up the pieces
Of the wreck you went and left
And I'm dealing with dilemmas
In my now so stressful life
I'm drinking stronger spirits
Made my home here on the floor
And I'm losing all ambition and goals

I'm going all out,
I'm thinking you're just as bad

I'm not sleeping at night
But I'm going from bar to bar
Why can't I just rewind
Why can't we just rewind
Why can't we just rewind

Remember at 16
The crazy drunken night we had
When I kissed you in the hallway
Then I took you straight to bed
Two years on
I'm still the same boy, and

I'm not sleeping at night
but I'm going from bar to bar
Why can't I just rewind
Why can't we just rewind
Why can't we just rewind

I'm not sleeping at night
But I'm going from bar to bar
Why can't I just rewind
Why can't we just rewind
Why can't we just rewind

You might blame it on me
But you insisted that we fall
Wiped your hands of me and said you needed more, more, more!

I'm not sleeping at night
But I'm going from bar to bar
Why can't I just rewind
Why can't we just rewind
Why can't we just rewind

I'm not sleeping at night
But I'm going from bar to bar
Why can't I just rewind
Why can't we just rewind
Why can't we just rewind

Oh

Why can't we just rewind
