Just like a paper tiger
Torn apart by idle hands
Through the halter skelter morning
Fix yourself while you still can

No more ashes to ashes
No more cinders from the sky
And all the laws of creation
Tell a dead man how to die

O deserts down below us
And storms up above
Like a stray dog gone defective
Like a paper tiger in the sun

Looking through a broken diamond
To make the past what it should be
Through the ruins and the weather
Capsized boats in the sea

O deserts down below us
And storms up above
Like a stray dog gone defective
Like a paper tiger in the sun

I just hold on to nothing
To see how long nothing lasts

O deserts down below us
And storms up above
Like a stray dog gone defective
Like a paper tiger in the sun
There is one road to the morning
There is one road to the truth
There is one road back to civilization
But there is no road back to you
