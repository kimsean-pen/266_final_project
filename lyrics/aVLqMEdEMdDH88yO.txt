If it's blood that you need to make the pills go down,
I will spill the blood
If the flies that you eat are tasting twice as sweet,
they came from rotting meat
If the skin on your teeth is drawing thin like a leaf,
and you are feeling weak
You can thank me

You say what you gotta say, I know
Feel the pain that you feel today, I know
It's a puzzle that we figure out
Take the hate and you spit it out
Take what's left and you let it in, let it in

Now the scum from the creek is filling up your cheeks,
and you can hardly speak
While the bones in your brain grind themselves away,
they will make you sane
If the steps of your path reflect your building wrath,
they will be your last
And you can thank me

You say what you gotta say, I know
Feel the pain that you feel today, I know
It's a puzzle that we figure out
Take the hate and you spit it out
Take what's left and you let it in, let it in

Got all the symptoms of decay
You see disease and look away
Begin the swarming from the caves
Burning the fields of amber waves
Raising the dead up from the grave
Amass an army of rotting slaves
