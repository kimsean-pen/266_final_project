You like New York City in the daytime
I like New York City in the nighttime
You say you like sleeping with the air off
I don't, I need it on
And you like the light coming through the windows
I sleep late, so I just keep 'em all closed
You ignore the music on the radio
I don't, I sing along

I don't ask for you to change
Baby, no no no
And you don't ask for me to change

You tell me how we're not alike
But we work so well, and we don't even know why
Funny how the stars crossed right
'Cause we work so well, and we don't even know why
And you could call it fire and ice
But we work so well, and we don't even know why
No, we don't even know why, no no
We don't even know why, no no no, no
No we don't even know why, no no no, no

Cold outside and you're just in a t-shirt
I have cold blood, even in a sweater
You start your night sippin' by the kilo
I don't, I know you know

I don't ask for you to change
Baby, nooo
And you don't ask for me to change, no

And you tell me how we're not alike
But we work so well, and we don't even know why
Funny how the stars crossed right
'Cause we work so well, and we don't even know why
And you could call it fire and ice
But we work so well, and we don't even know why
No, we don't even know why, no no
We don't even know why, no no no, no
We don't even know
No, we don't know
No no, noo

Somehow we end up on the same side
And you wouldn't think that we'd be alright
Even our eyes are different colors
But we see fine
Somehow we end up on the same side
And you wouldn't think that we'd be alright
Even our eyes are different colors
But we see fine

Ohh
Because we work so well, but we don't even know why
Because we work so well, but we don't even know why
Yeah, because we work so well, and we don't even know why, why
No, we don't even know why, no no
We don't even know why
Na na na na, no
We don't even know why
No, noo
We don't even know why
