When I lost him ache
Shudder shock of pale
My, my true love
Nicolo Denotti

These days are smoking days
But they won't see
(Deceived me)You deceived me
(With you) Erase it I will not

(to stay) Touching her lies (didn't he know Alice?)

(I will plead) Nodding an excuse you

(Alice, Alice, Alice, Alice, Alice)

would share

(Alice, Alice, Alice, Alice, Alice)
who shall
(Alice, Alice, Alice, Alice, Alice)
replace
(Alice, Alice, Alice, Alice, Alice)
you
When I lost him ache
Shudder shock of pale

My, my true love
Nicolo Denotti
This is mess I'll smoke away
And he won't see

(pushing me) Look she fell
(with you) Racing her bike
(so you) Touching her lies
(not me) Nodding an excuse you

would share
(Alice, Alice, Alice, Alice, Alice)
who shall replace
(Alice, Alice, Alice, Alice, Alice)
you
(Alice, Alice, Alice, Alice, Alice)
When I lost him ache
Shudder shock of pale
My, my true love
Nicolo Denotti
This mess I'll smoke away
But he won't see
(Alice)
Oops she fell
Racing her bike
Touching her lies
Nodding an excuse you
Would share
(Alice, Alice)
Who shall replace her
(Alice, Alice, Alice, Alice, Alice) x3
