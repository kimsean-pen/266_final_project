And I said park your car and come on up to my house
We'll plan a revolution
And I said yeah I think I'm ready to begin
We'll destroy the disillusion

I am currently under construction
Thank you for your patience
We veneer unveil we present a cold disguise
We're all undercover agents

It's only in our heads
It's only in our heads

I'm so done with the pressure
You ever try to control everyone's perception
I'm done with the weather
Trapped in the mist I can't find myself

It's only in our heads
It's only in our heads

I'm so done with the pressure
I'm so done with the pressure

And I said if you want to go far and wide now
We've got to go together
And I said if you want to go far and wide now
We've got to go together

Tonight I'm howling with the wolves
Yeah I'm howling can you hear us now
I was seeking another life
And the moon was so bright

Tonight I'm howling with the wolves
Yeah I'm howling can you hear us now
I was seeking another life
And the moon was so bright

It's only in our heads
It's only in our heads

I'm so done with the pressure
Twist and control everyone's perception
I'm done with the weather
Trapped in the mist I can't see the truth

It's only in our heads
It's only in our heads

I'm so done with the pressure
I'm so done with the pressure

Park your car and come on up to my house
I want to see your body
I don't want the gloss I want to see the truth
I want to see your body

Tonight I'm howling with the wolves
Yeah I'm howling can you hear us now
I was seeking another life
And the moon was so bright

Tonight I'm howling with the wolves
Yeah I'm howling can you hear us now
I was seeking another life
And the moon was so bright
