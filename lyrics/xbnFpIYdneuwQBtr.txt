Spent a lot of time in the background
I know I spent a lot of time in the background
Everytime that we together, I black out
Everytime that we together, she tap out
I remember, but she part of my past now
I remember all this shit from the past now
Took a pill and we passed out
I made a deal with the devil

You know I got my problems
Know you got yours too
Hold on to my revolver
They ain't looking for you
Oh, girl, don't even bother
Why she act brand new?
Take what the devil offers
I got nothing to lose
