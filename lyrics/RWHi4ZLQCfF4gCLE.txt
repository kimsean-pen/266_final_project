In this struggle
Are we dead or alive?
Freedom is not existence
It's how we survive
Shake our grief
Hold on to belief
It can't enslave us forever
There is relief
No change will be permanent
Our strength enduring bright incandescent
Take a chance before we fall
Pressed against the wall

And the sun will rise
Dawn will break through blackest night
Distant in its glow
This shall pass be still and know

Where there's heartache
As we search to connect
Even just for a moment
Pretend we're content
There is love
Know that we are one
We are all in this
Together weather the storm
Look into each other's eyes
Make the connection before it dies
It will all disseminate
As we consummate

And the sun will rise
Dawn will break through blackest night
Distant in its glow
This shall pass be still and know

Is it hopeless?
Will the fear take control?
Don't succumb to the numbing
Sting of defeat
Take this hate
Let the bile stagnate
Hoist the head of Goliath
Bask in its grace
Stars realign in the sky
Glaciers will melt and the oceans rise
Waves will come crashing ashore
But withstand the roar

And the sun will rise
Dawn will break through blackest night
Distant in its glow
This shall pass be still and know
