Jubilee slouches in his settee
He's losing all will to move
He got dippy, too much telly
He watching 24 hours of rubbish
He got butane, he got plastic bags
His eyes are going square, oh, yeah
He's no raver, just anti-social
He not going to cut his hair

He dresses incorrectly
No one told him how (seventeen)
He not mean enough
He dresses incorrectly
No one told him how (seventeen)
He not keen on being like
Anyone else

Jubilee's dad, Billy Banker
Thinks his son's a slob
Should get out more, stop scabbing
He really should go and get a job

He dresses incorrectly
No one told him how to do it (seventeen)
He's not mean enough
He dresses incorrectly
No one told him how (where to go)
But he just don't get out enough
He dresses incorrectly
No one told him how (where to go)
But he just don't get out enough
He dresses incorrectly
No one told him how to do it (talk to girls)
But he's just to spotty
He dresses incorrectly
No one told him how (seventeen)
He not keen on being like
Anyone else

So he just plays on his computer game

He dresses incorrectly
No one told him how to do it (seventeen)
He's not mean enough
He dresses incorrectly
No one told him how (where to go)
But he just don't get out enough
He dresses incorrectly
No one told him how to do it (talk to girls)
But he's just too spotty
He dresses incorrectly
No one told him how to do it (seventeen)
He's not keen on being like anyone
He's not being like anyone
Jubilee is not like
Anyone else
