You got to know
I'm always in the way
Upside down to you

Open to all
These tangled knots of living
Finally caught me too

Don't leave me alone
Standing here for ever
Hoping you how ever

I'm a little girl
Boiled into a mature
Little piece of work

So if you see me
So if you see me
Just smile

So if you see me
So if you see me
Just try

On and on
On and on
On and on
On and on
On and on
On and on
On and on
On and on
On and on
