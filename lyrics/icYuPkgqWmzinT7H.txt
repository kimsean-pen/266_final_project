The flames is weak and frail
A circle of shiverin men
Enclosed by endless coldness
The evernight, eternal dark

The moan of undying winds
Now merged with hollow screaming
The fire dies in a sngle breath
The end has come

Out of the darkness, out of the cold
Out of the night, they have come
Cruel is the laughter, cruel is the fate
Cruel is the winter's will

Merciless is the fray
Bitter the final stand
Perdition and ruin;
The icy grip now traps them
Right here at the world's end
The forst of death will take them all

The lords of the high seas
Are smitten down into snow
No way to bear the fury
No way to ward off all the fiends

Devouring the sun and the earth
Devouring the forest and sea

Devouring us all

Sing a quiet song to me
Sing of spring and sing of sea
Sing a silent song to me
Sing of hope and sing of sleep
