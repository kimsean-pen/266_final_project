Street's like a jungle so call the police
Following the herd down to Greece on a holiday
Love in the 90's is paranoid
On sunny beaches, take your chances

Looking for girls who are boys, who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls
Who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love

Girls who are boys, who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls
Who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Avoiding all work 'cause there's none available
Like battery thinkers, count your thoughts

On one, two, three, four, five fingers
Nothing is wasted, they only reproduced
You get nasty blisters, du bist sehr sch√∂n
But we haven't been introduced

Always should be someone you really love
