Lover
You say a word
But now the ship is gone
Lover
Who will know you?
Lover
You should be shivering in wind this cold
Lover
Frozen still in the fishbowl
What moves you?

I stay up til 3
It's a long time to waste
Asking you questions while you sleep
They are free
The feelings unfolding
In fact in dream mutters the empty voice
Lover, Lover
You say a word
But now the ship is gone
Lover
Who will know you?
Lover, Lover
Firm in your mystery
Will you remember the body
And what does it do to you?
The ride is long
The story old
