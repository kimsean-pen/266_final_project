Your scent became again
Vanishing memory
Repeating lace of pain
Why this endless misery?
As our oblivion
This void will hunt you
Can't be forgiven
Our love, the tears for two.

Oh I wish to reach your heart
Life is just an empty dream
We will never be apart
Take me home forever.

Trough time I'm in control
Whispering cruelty
Today you have my soul
Who is who in this puppetry?
Lost our connection
Feelings I once knew
Crying for meaning
All alone, the death for two.

Oh I wish to reach your heart
Life is just an empty dream
We will never be apart
Take me home forever.

"I'm another mess
When I alive
How long will I turns?"

Oh I wish to reach your heart
Life is just an empty dream
We will never be apart
Take me home forever, ever!

Oh I wish to reach your heart
Life is just an empty dream
We will never be apart
Take me home forever.
