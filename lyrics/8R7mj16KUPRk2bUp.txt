Ooh, my little pretty one
My pretty one
When you gonna give me some time?
Sharona
Ooh, you make my motor run
My motor run
Can't you come in off the line?
Sharona

Never gonna stop, give it up
Such a dirty mind
I always get it up all the time
But you're not that kind
My, my, my, my, ah, woh
My, my, my Sharona

Come a little closer hon
Will you hon?
Close enough to look in my eyes
Sharona
Keep it in a mystery your kissing me
Running down the length of my thighs
Sharona

Never gonna stop, give it up
Such a dirty mind
I always get it up all the time
But you're not that kind
My, my, my, my, ah, woh
My, my, my Sharona
My, my, my, Sharona

When you gonna get to me, get to me
Is it just a matter of time?
Sharona
Here's a touch of destiny, of destiny
Or is it just a game in my mind?
Sharona

Never gonna stop, give it up
Such a dirty mind
I always get it up all the time
But you're not that kind
My, my, my, my, ah, woh
My, my, my Sharona
My, my, my, Sharona

My, my, my Sharona
My, my, my Sharona
Oh, my Sharona
Oh, my Sharona
Oh, my Sharona
