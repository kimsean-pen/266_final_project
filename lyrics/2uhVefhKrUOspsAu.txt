You feel, no one listens, before saying you're through
You fear, nothing takes you as far as you'll go

This song is not about you
The life that stands without you
Your body and blood
Your body and blood
You're leaving us all

I keep my head up high to ease my mind
Of all these true sensations
I keep my head up high to ease my mind
Of all these true sensations
I keep my head up high to ease my mind
Of all these true sensations
I keep my head up high to ease my mind
Of all these true sensations

You feel, nothing ever stays the same as it was
You'll take, no more remedities to force yourself true
You say, every motion and fall fail you too

This song is not about you
The life that stands without you
Your body and blood
Your body and blood
You're leaving us all

I keep my head up high to ease my mind
Of all these true sensations
I keep my head up high to ease my mind
Of all these true sensations
I keep my head up high to ease my mind
Of all these true sensations
I keep my head up high to ease my mind
Of all these true sensations
