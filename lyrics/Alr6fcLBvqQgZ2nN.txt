The moon and the surf
Are rushing through my brain
Rolling in my heart
Swirling in the wind
Blue is redemption
The tide that never changed
Breaking in my heart
We are born again

I'm climbing
Under a sky so blue it yearns
Hand over hand
Carrying all the memories
And don't look down
On fate or fame
I tumble and glide
Into the white white tide
Whirling and whirling
And let the slamming waves decide my fate
Because hope is all I need

Hope breaks on me
Hope breaks on me
Hope breaks on me

The moon and the surf, oh...
Take me down
The moon and the surf, oh...
Take me down
Take me down
The moon and the surf, oh...
Take me down
The moon and the surf, oh...
