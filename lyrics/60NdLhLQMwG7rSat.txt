I must've dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street

Now did you read the news today
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight
There burning into the night

There's too many men
Too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see
This is a land of confusion

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

Ooh Superman where are you now
When everything's gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, the men of power
Are losing control by the hour

This is the time
This is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go round
Tell me why, this is a land of confusion

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

This is the world we live in
And these are the names we're given
Stand up and let's start showing
Just where our lives are going to
