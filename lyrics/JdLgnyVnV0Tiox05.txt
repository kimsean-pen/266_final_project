Put your Dukes up John
Yeah, put your dukes up John
You were preened and sanitised
Struck dumb by good advice.

Your integrity was bruised
Your celebrity a ruse
They pulled the rug from under
Made way for new pretenders.

Put your Dukes up, John
(Change your tune and change your hair)
Put your Dukes up, John
(Or you're not going anywhere)

(Or you're not going anywhere)
Be a C.Y.N.I.C.
Be a C.Y.N.I.C.

The profit margin blinds them
They groomed and ostracised him
His calm makes my blood boil
His calm makes my blood boil
