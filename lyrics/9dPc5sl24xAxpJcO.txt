Every time I look up to you I don't know myself
Every time I say so, you don't talk back
Every time I enter it, I don't do that
I'm in [?] you don't [?]
I'm on my fence, let me be black
[?] I can't remember

I remember the time [?]
Think you're a big man?
Why'd you talk back?
Push my chair back

Think you're a big man?
Why'd you talk back?
