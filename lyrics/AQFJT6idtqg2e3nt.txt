Here am I at a loss
I don't know what to do
Feel like a waterless Nile
Come here just hold me
To feel safe enough to some
Daring to senses sure
A fable look what happens when
I don't risk losing you
There's no guarantee
How are we to know if the response is coming
I'm in the wrong place
Is it like a, is it like a
Is it like a dream
Or is it, or is it seem grounded and real
(Seem very untrue)
Is it like a, Is it like a, is it like a dream
Or is it, or is it seem grounded and real
(Seem very untrue)
I feel a connection, a deep connection
But it's not reflected
In time spent together
It's reflected cycle
Clear imaginary
Is it like a, is it like a, is it like a dream
(This mountain of pleasure)
Or is it, or is it, seem grounded and real
(Oh oh I want to get lost in it)
Is it like a, is it like a, is it like a dream
(Sleep like a baby)
Or is it, or is it, seem grounded and real
(Still close, still close)
Is it like a, is it like a, is it like a dream
Or is it, or is it, seem grounded and real
(Until I don't know where you end
Or I begin
Until I just carry it in me
Carry it in me carry it in me
I wanna get lost
Wanna get lost
Wanna get lost
Lost in it
We're still close
Still close)
