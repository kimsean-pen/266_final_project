I'm talkin'
I'm talkin'
I'm talkin' to myself more

Needle, fatal
Someone's pouring warm gravy all over me
And you see that synthetic therapy
Don't you know it seems to be so
Unappealing
But, oh what a feeling

I wish that you would stop spitting when
You're talking to me

And inside, air dry
I might want to go another way
But you see now I'm too pale to
Get out
Into the lovely light of day
Oh, I'll do anything that you say
Oh, I'll do anything that you say

But I wish you would stop spitting when
You're talking to me

I'm talking to myself more
(repeat 6 times)

1 x 1

Man to man
Stand to stand

2 x 4

Talkin' to myself
