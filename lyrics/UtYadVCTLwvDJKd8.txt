Were we just another story
Waiting for another warning
Were we just another story
Now they made it up

But how long have we been here?
How long
Can we stay?

Was told that I've been here before
There's something underneath my bones

But how long we've been scared
And how far can we stray?
How long have we been here?
How long can we stay

No light no love
No lies no one
No lies no one
No lies no one
