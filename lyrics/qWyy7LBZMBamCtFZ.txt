Oh, man
Oh, mister sandman
I want it in bed
Or nothing at all
I sleep on empty
Can't beat me
I want it in bed
Or nothing at all

Hey there, hey there
Mister, mister
No, please don't leave me alone
What'd you bring me, bring me?
No, hey, don't leave me alone
Rock bottom, feed me, feed me
I won't go early
Ring!

Oh, man
Oh, I don't know, man
Make him the cutest
Or nothing at all
I sleep on empty
Can't beat me
I want it in bed
Or nothing at all

Hey there, hey there
Mister, mister
No, please don't leave me alone
What'd you bring me, bring me?
No, hey, don't leave me alone
Rock bottom, feed me, feed me
I won't go early
Ring!
