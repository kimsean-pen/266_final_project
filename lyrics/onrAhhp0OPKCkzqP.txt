If only you read my mind
You'd see I was hurt inside
A thousand times I've told myself it's over (it's over)
The story has just begun
And darling what's done is done
It's time to change and leave the past behind

Why should we know all the answers
Or how the story ends

So baby

Let's take a chance on a happy ending
Let's turn the page and stop pretending
The past can't stop a heart from mending
It's time to let go
'Cos baby you know
Some things are better best forgotten

And baby we can't pretend
In time the scars will mend
Please believe me there's a chance, let's take it (let's take it)
And maybe at last we'll find
That love should be true not blind
You can't deceive a heart that's open wide

And even now it's not too late
To change the story's end

So baby

Let's take a chance on a happy ending
Let's turn the page and stop pretending
The past can't stop a heart from mending
It's time to let go
'Cos baby you know
Some things are better best forgotten

Better best forgotten

The story has just begun
And darling what's done is done
It's time to change and leave the past behind

Let's take a chance on a happy ending
Let's turn the page and stop pretending
The past can't stop a heart from mending
It's time to let go
'Cos baby you know
Some things are better best forgotten

Let's take a chance on a happy ending
Let's turn the page and stop pretending
The past can't stop a heart from mending
It's time to let go
'Cos baby you know
Some things are better best forgotten
