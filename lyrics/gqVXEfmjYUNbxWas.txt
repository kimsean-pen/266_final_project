In the twilight
Underneath the ground
There is life still
It is singing loud
And even when the saplings bend
Their roots will still expand
And peace is more than just a season
Coming 'round again

In a past life
Guided by the stars
Gazing upwards
Navigating where we are
But even when the sky gets drowned out
By the city lights
We can still try and make out
What we are inside

And, oh, thunder
A warning shot
A bomb dropped elsewhere
How can we
Keep waking up the same?
So I wonder
Is the light
Before thunder
Here again?

And, oh, thunder
A warning shot
A bomb dropped elsewhere
How can we
Keep waking up the same?
So I wonder
Is the light
Before thunder
Here again?
