We were just a plain ol' hillbilly band
With a plain ol' country style
We never played the kind of songs
That'd drive anybody wild

Played a railroad song with a stomping beat
We played a blues song kinda slow and sweet
But the thing that knocked them off
Of their feet was, ooh-wee

When Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie

Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie in a strangest kind of way
Play it strange

Well, we did our best to entertain
Everywhere we'd go
We'd nearly wear our fingers
Off to give the folks a show

Played jumping jive to make 'em get in the groove
We played sad songs real slow and smooth
But the only thing that'd
Make 'em move was, ooh-wee

When Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie

Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie-woogie
Luther played the boogie in a strangest kind of way

Now didn't Luther play the boogie strange?
