I dont need night vision
To find you in the dark
Glowinlike a television
Let my love rain down

Get on your knees
And praise me like you should
When it comes to bein bad
Youre so good

When the night gets heavy
Lay your heaven on me
Sparks illuminate us
I'll find you in the dark

When the sky isfalling
I'll be your atlas holding
The world on my shoulders
I'll find you in the dark

I'll find you in the dark
I'll find you in the dark

I dont need night vision
To see right into your soul
Supernatural lover
Move through me like a ghost

Get on your knees
And praise me like you should
When it comes to bein bad
Youre so good

When the night gets heavy
Lay your heaven on me
Sparks illuminate us
I'll find you in the dark

When the sky is falling
I'll be your atlas holding
The world on my shoulders
I'll find you in the dark

I'll find you in the dark
I'll find you in the dark

When the night gets heavy
Lay your heaven on me
Sparks illuminate us
I'll find you in the dark

When the sky is falling
I'll be your atlas holding
The world on my shoulders
I'll find you in the dark
When the night gets heavy
Lay your heaven on me
Sparks illuminate us
I'll find you in the dark
When the sky is falling
I'll be your atlas holding
The world on my shoulders
I'll find you in thedark
I'll find you in the dark
I'll find you in the dark
