your world is a self-delusion
your gifts are illusions
to always be right
you make it so
and what have you got
to show

echoes in your head
your voice everywhere
still you follow, follow
others instead
jump over the edge
no cord no snare
life time ago just cause he said
a fairytale he told
a rollercoaster ride
it was all a lie just a little white lie

can you tell me why?
can you tell me how?
what you told me million times before
million times before
can you tell me why?
can you tell me how?
what you told me million times before
million times before
