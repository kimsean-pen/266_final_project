You got me with my back up against the wall
I try to walk away but I begin to fall
Push me to the edge of eternity
Out here on my own for the world to see
And maybe this is it, maybe I'm afraid
But I'm okay
I won't break, I'll never blister
You forget we're just the same
And I know the better days are on their way
I was blind and you were broken
Now I can see the end of me
And I will fight tonight to get up off my knees
With every part of me
With every part of me
With every part of me
You left me in the dark where I couldn't see
Forced to be the person that I couldn't be
Out here in this world of uncertainty
You used to my piece in my harmony
Maybe this is it, but I'm not afraid
I'm okay
I won't break, I'll never blister
You forget we're just the same
And I know the better days are on their way
I was blind and you were broken
Now I can see the end of me
And I will fight tonight to get up off my knees
With every part of me
The weight of this world won't last forever
And every piece of me you will remember
You will remember
You will remember
I won't break, I'll never blister
You forget we're just the same
And I know the better days are on their way
I was blind and you were broken
Now I can see the end of me
And I will fight tonight to get up off my knees
With every part of me
With every part of me
With every part of me
With every part of me
With every part of me
