The lights go down

One day, I gotta get out of here
I gotta make everything clear
I gotta see you, oh, oh

I know the way that I feel is wrong, so wrong
But I gotta carry on
When you ain't around

I believe things are going wrong
And the night goes on and on
All your dreams have flown away
And the sun won't shine today

The lights go down (I want you, baby)
The lights go down (I need you, baby)
The lights go down
And there's no one around

I know you're waiting so close to me
But how will you ever see
As time rolls away?

Lonely, but tryin' to be so proud
And just as I turn around
The lights go down

I believe things are going wrong
And the night goes on and on
All your dreams have flown away
And the sun won't shine today

The lights go down (I want you, baby)
The lights go down (I need you, baby)
The lights go down
And there's no one around

The lights go down (I want you, baby)
The lights go down (I need you, baby)
The lights go down
And there's no one around

The lights go down (I want you, baby)
The lights go down (I need you, baby)
The lights go down (I want you, baby)
The lights go down
