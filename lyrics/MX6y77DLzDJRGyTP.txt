Fall asleep in the green
Under the waves
Til the birds steal the liver I grew
Fall asleep in the green
Until my eyes paint me pictures of you

You're alone in the house, boy
You're a bird in a cage
Some days I need way more than I've got

I bend beneath the water
I bend beneath the sea
I bend beneath the water top
Where you left me

I'll draw the fever
Put your faith in me
If I'd known before I wouldn't tear it out

I swear I wouldn't go
The coastal shelf, the coastal shelf
I swear I wouldn't go
The coastal shelf, the coastal shelf

Push the splinter deeper
Underground in the vein
Too much blame to leave it all to chance

I swear I wouldn't go
The coastal shelf, the coastal shelf
I swear I wouldn't go
The coastal shelf, the coastal shelf

I swear I wouldn't go
The coastal shelf, the coastal shelf
I swear I wouldn't go
The coastal shelf, the coastal shelf
