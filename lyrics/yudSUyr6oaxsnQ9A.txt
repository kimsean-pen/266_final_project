I can't say that I'm sorry
Get so ahead of myself
I can't say that I'm sorry
For loving you and hating myself
I had nothing to show you
I had nothing to hold you down
It's killing me to walk away

How come you don't want me now?
Why don't you want to wait this out?
How come you always lead me on
Never take my call, hear me out?

Why don't you want to win me now?
Why don't you want to show me off?
Tell me why you couldn't try,
Couldn't try and meet me here

I see you by my house
Walking with a different girl
I see you by my house
Talking with a different girl

She's got nothing to show you
She's got nothing to hold you down
You're killing me to walk away

How come you don't want me now?
Why don't you want to wait this out?
How come you always lead me on
Never take my call, hear me out?

Why don't you want to win me now?
Why don't you want to show me off?
Tell me why you couldn't try,
Couldn't try and meet me here

Why tell you
I will be the one to insult you
Someday soon
I will be the one to insult you

How come you don't want me now?

How come you always lead me on
Never take my call, hear me out?

Why don't you want to win me now?

Tell me why you couldn't try,
Couldn't try and meet me here

How come you don't want me now?
Why don't you want to wait this out?
How come you always lead me on
Never take my call, hear me out?

Why don't you want to win me now?
Why don't you want to show me off?
Tell me why you couldn't try,
Couldn't try and meet me here

How come you don't want me now?
Why don't you want to wait this out?
How come you always lead me on
Never take my call, hear me out?

Why don't you want to win me now?
Why don't you want to show me off?
Tell me why you couldn't try,
Couldn't try and meet me here
