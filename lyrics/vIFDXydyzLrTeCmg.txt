(Verse)
You seem to be inevitable to me
Like a memory of the future
I was and will be with you

(Pre-Chorus)
Over and over again
I keep tasting that sweet memory
Looking back of my life now I'm in
Asking if not later then when

(Chorus)
It's taking me all of my life
It's taking me all of my life to find you
It's taking me all of my life
It's taking me all of my life to find you
You, you, you, you

(Verse)
You unlock the past,
So many scenes moving fast
At last the right conclusion
Or at least a sweet illusion

(Pre-Chorus)
Over and over again
I keep tasting that sweet memory
Looking back of my life now I'm in
Asking if not later then when

(Chorus)
It's taking me all of my life
It's taking me all of my life to find you
It's taking me all of my life
It's taking me all of my life to find you

(Bridge)
You seem to be a perfect memory
Of the future, reminding me
How life is meant to be

(Pre-Chorus)
Over and over again
I keep tasting that sweet memory
Looking back of my life now I'm in
Asking if not later then when

(Chorus x2)
It's taking me all of my life
It's taking me all of my life to find you
It's taking me all of my life
It's taking me all of my life to find you

It's taking me all of my life
