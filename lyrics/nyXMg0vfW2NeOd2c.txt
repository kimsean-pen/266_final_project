You look pretty in your fancy dress, but I detect unhappiness.
You never speak, so I have to guess you're not free.

Yeah, maybe when you're old enough, you'll realize that you're not so tough.
And some days, the seas get rough, you'll see.
You're too young to have it figured out, you think you know what you're talkin' about.
You think it all will work itself out, but we'll see...

When I was young, I thought I knew.
You probably think you know, too.
Do you? Well, do you?

I was naive just like you,
I thought I knew exactly what I wanted to do.
Well, what you gonna do?
What a fool.

And how've you gotten by so far without a head and no visible scar?
No one knowin' who you really are, they can't see...

What you gonna do? (What you gonna do?)
What you gonna do now?
What you gonna do? (What you gonna do?)
What you gonna do now?
What you gonna do? (What you gonna do?)
What you gonna do now?
What you gonna do? (What you gonna do?)
What you gonna do now?
What you gonna do now?

Yeah...

The only way you'll ever learn a thing,
Is to admit that you know absolutely nothing...
Oh, nothing.

Think about this carefully,
You might not get another chance to speak freely...
Oh, freely.

Maybe when you're old enough,
Maybe when you're old enough,
Maybe when you're old enough,
You're not free.
Yeah, you're not free...
