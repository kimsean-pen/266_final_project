(Things are getting heavy, why don't you get ready?)

Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby, please don't cry

To stay awake
You take a pill
You think you're moving
But you're standing still
You can't sleep
It's overkill
You think you're cruising
But it's all downhill

Maybe I could put you in the right direction
Call me, if you can't decide
I believe you're beyond correction
Wouldn't be the first time I made you cry

Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby, please don't cry
Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby all the time

Oh me, oh my (things are getting heavy, why don't you get ready?)
Don't cry baby, please don't cry
Oh me, oh my (time for you to ... up, time for you to grow up)
Don't cry baby all the time (I'm about to blow up)

This won't hurt
No, not a bit
You'd better take your medicine
'Cause you are sick
Your blood runs cold
You won't be told
You're a bad seed already sowed

Maybe I could put you in the right direction
Call me, if you can't decide
Crawling back to me looking for redemption
Wouldn't be the first time I heard you cry

Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby, please don't cry
Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby all the time

Oh me, oh my (things are getting heavy, why don't you get ready?)
Don't cry baby, please don't cry
Oh me, oh my (time for you to ... up, time for you to grow up)
Don't cry baby all the time (I'm about to blow up)

Who do you think is to blame?
Everybody but you
You couldn't care less
About the things that you do
Sick of hearing you cry
Sick of hearing those lies
Tired of wiping the tears
From your eyes

You'd better go, baby

Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby, please don't cry
Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby all the time

Oh me, oh my (things are getting heavy, why don't you get ready?)
Don't cry baby, please don't cry
Oh me, oh my (time for you to ... up, time for you to grow up)
Don't cry baby all the time (I'm about to blow up)

Oh me, oh my
Don't cry baby, please don't cry
