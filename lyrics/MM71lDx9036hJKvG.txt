I got confused when I saw the bruises on your neck
When I said it out loud, your desperation was the best
But I'm not that kind of lady - I'm not here to wreck your head

I'll bring my A game
I'll bring my A game

Gonna put on nice things just to see you tonight
Take the high streets now we're feeling alive
You're just that kind of man - it's like you're here to wreck my head

Don't be that guy
Don't be that
I hate it but I'm not complaining
I'm still chasing
Don't be that guy

Did you really think that you could get away from me tonight?
Did you really think that you would make it out of here alive?
I'm not gonna let you go 'cause I'm alive and I'm alone

Keeping all these changes in my head, it's alright
One day I'll make it to the end of the line
I'm not gonna give up easy - I'll give everything I know

I'll bring my A game
I'll bring my A game

Don't be that guy
Don't be that
I hate it but I'm not complaining
I'm still chasing
I'm still chasing
Oh I hate it but I'm not complaining
I'm still chasing just
Don't be that guy
