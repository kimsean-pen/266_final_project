neither here nor there
i am out of control
these days i feign forgetful
but oh my memory teases

and i wake
ashamed of my fantasy
when i dream of us
as two strains of bacteria
of a porch talk that lasts 1.5 billion years

are you not learning
have you not been listening
are you not learning
you have not been listening

i guess my tongue was softer then
but no one's trying
and i'm sick of it
'there's no crying in baseball,
try to understand'
their chapped lips begging me
over and over again
over and over again
