What is this reaction
From the dark side of the moon?
Who are they to challenge
A society in bloom?
Will they start a fire
and delete us from the world?
What is this reaction?

Can you feel it go boom,
Breaking out of your chest?
This hour is not our time to die
Can you hear it beating under your skin?
Our past is like a map of where we've never been

We keep pumping like machines
We are the immortals
We go up, up, up and we're living the dream
We're the immortal men, we're dream machines
Interaction of the very last degree
And no matter what they say
This is our legacy

All across the nations
Living loud and living free
Dire accusations
Of your inner enemy
You bring allegations
That don't apply to me
Just to start the fire

Oh can you see, can you see our future now?
I can't believe this rejection
I can't accept that our end has come...
What caused this complete confusion?
I never knew anything we couldn't fight
and I don't see our imperfections
I just believe if we can live through this
We'll stop future mass intrusions

Can we win this war?
To send them flying off our dying shores

Interaction of the very last degree
But no matter what they say
We salute our legacy
We didn't come this far to fail,
no, humanity will prevail
