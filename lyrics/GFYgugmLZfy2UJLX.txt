By far worse is the hambuger lady,
We must heal them for the qualified technicians,
Worse,
Alternating nights are automatic,
She's lying there,

Hamburger Lady
Hamburger Lady

She's dying,
She is burned from the waist up,
On her arm,
Her ear is burned,
Her eyelashes are burned,
She can't hold things up,
And even with medical advances,
There's no end in sight,
For hamburger lady,
She wants me to tell you of her claim mind,
From which the double play laying,
The proping chair,
Leave her,
She's Burned from the waist down,
Has to eat her life through tubes,

Hamburger Lady
Hamburger Lady

She's okay if you change the tubes,
Tubes in her legs,
the tubes in her arms,
She's okay,
Then it came out and saw the burn net,
Indeed in the account of killing,
And it flashed on the carpet,
And it flashed on the floor,
The hamburger lady,
She came to rest,
Because of the burn she needs relief,
From the medication,
The qualified Technician,

Hamburger Lady
