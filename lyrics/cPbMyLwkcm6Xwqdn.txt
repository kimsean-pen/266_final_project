Love me black and blue,
You got no care as mocking birds
Stares me stares at you
I don't know how to stay afloat
Now you want to play
Why I never heard the world
I can be your moonlight
I'm not in my dress

She does nothing all day
But sit down and cry
She touches the sky
And wishes to play
She does nothing all day
But sit down and cry
She touches the sky
And wishes to play
She does nothing all day
But sit down and cry
She touches the sky
And wishes to play
She does nothing all day
But sit down and cry
Sit down and cry

Love me black and blue,
You got no care as mocking birds
I can be your moonlight
I'm not in my dress

She does nothing all day
But sit down and cry
She touches the sky
And wishes to play
She does nothing all day
But sit down and cry
She touches the sky
And wishes to play
She does nothing all day
But sit down and cry
She touches the sky
And wishes to play
She does nothing all day
But sit down and cry
Sit down and cry
