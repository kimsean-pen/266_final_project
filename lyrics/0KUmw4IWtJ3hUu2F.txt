I was in the backseat
You were passin' drinks my way
I was thinkin' 'bout leavin'
And you were beggin' me to stay

Did you ever find Jesus
When you were on your knees that day?
Prayin' for forgiveness
And I was pushin' you away

I never said I want you around
But we were both in the same town
And you know exactly how to make me lose my mind
We lost faith but it's alright
'Cause two wrongs make a good time
Yeah, two wrongs make a good time

You were never there when I called ya, I was always waitin'
Maybe you were never there at all just in my imagination
I don't wanna go back to being strangers
But if you're in my life then my life's in danger

I can't stop fallin'
I can't stop fallin' down
My world's a mess and I can't seem to pick myself back up now
'Cause you're everywhere I go just creepin' up on me
I don't know if I should shut you out or let you in
You always let me win but...

You were never there when I called ya, I was always waitin'
Maybe you were never there at all just in my imagination
I don't wanna go back to being strangers
But if you're in my life then my life's in danger

You were never there when I called ya, I was always waitin'
Maybe you were never there at all just in my imagination
I don't wanna go back to being strangers
But if you're in my life then my life's in danger
My life's in danger
