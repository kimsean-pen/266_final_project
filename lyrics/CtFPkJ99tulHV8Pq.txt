They don't know, they they don't know

Tryin' to steal all your gold

Okay okay okay, a beautiful mistake
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't think I can spare, spare another day
'Cause these ants are crawlin' all up on me
On, on, on me
Ladybugs, chemicals all up in my hair
I hope that doesn't own me
Own, own, own, me

But baby, do you feel me?

Okay okay okay, a beautiful mistake
Yeah, yeah, yeah
