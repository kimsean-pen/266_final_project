Yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah

You ain't never think about nobody but yourself
Selfish
I don't really care, wait until you're gonna need my help
Helpless
You ain't never think about nobody but yourself
Selfish
I don't really care, wait until you're gonna need my help
Helpless (Help me, please)

You must be the only child because you're so stingy
I just wanna go buck wild when you don't defend me
I been on the fuckin' prowl
I been counting Benjis
You done turned my heart so cold
I should work at Friendly's
Ain't shit sweet

Darlin', darlin', I've been prayin' for you, for you
For you (I been prayin' for ya, I been prayin' for ya)
(I been prayin', I been, I been, I been prayin' for you)
Darlin', darlin',
I've been calling on God for you (Hope that He pick up)
No, for you (Jesus Christ, pick up)
(I'm hoping that he pick up)

It's not your fault, it's how you were raised
Excuses, excuses really all that you say
Not here to play, you can't seem to share
Every other day, you forget how to care
About me, about me
What about me? About me?
Forgot me, what about me?
Used to be like P.B. (Help me, please)

You must be the only child because you're so stingy
I just wanna go buckwild, but you don't defend me
I been on the fuckin' prowl
I been counting Benjis
You done turned my heart so cold
I should work at Friendly's
Ain't shit sweet
Darlin', darlin', I've been prayin' for you, for you
For you, ooh

You ain't never think about nobody but yourself
Selfish
I don't really care, wait until you're gonna need my help
Helpless
You ain't never think about nobody but yourself
Selfish
I don't really care, wait until you're gonna need my help
Helpless

Every move you make, man, I swear it seem suspicious
Lyin' through your teeth, so I don't rush to give you kisses
Spiteful and malicious, hope that other chick got syphilis
Sick of this, hard to stomach, now that nigga shitting bricks
Hypocrite, punch you in your lip, oh shit, you slippin', sis
Used to arch my back for you
And now I'm your arch-nemesis
All men should be feminists
Donald Trump fucks immigrants
I don't want to work it out
So cancel our gym membership
I'ma leave this nigga, don't believe me, nigga?
I was make-believin', nigga, it was only one season, nigga
M.O.D., my nigga, money over dick
Money over dick
You should stop breathing, nigga

You must be the only child because you're so stingy
I just wanna go buck wild when you don't defend me
I been on the fuckin' prowl
I been countin' Benjis
You done turned my heart so cold
I should work at Friendly's
Ain't shit sweet

Darlin', darlin', I've been prayin' for you, for you
For you (I been prayin' for ya, I been prayin' for ya)
(I been prayin', I been, I been, I been prayin' for you)
Darlin', darlin',
I've been callin' on God for you
(Hope that He pick up)
No, for you (Jesus Christ, pick up)
Ooh
