I've been around for you
Been up and down for you
But I just can't get any relief
I've swallowed my pride for you
I've lived and lied for you
But you still make me feel like a thief
You got me stealin' your love away
'Cause you never give it
Peelin' the years away
And we can't relive it
Oh I make you laugh
And you make me cry
I believe it's time for me to fly
You said we'd work it out
You said that ya had no doubt
That deep down we were really in love
Oh, but I'm tired of holdin' on
To a feelin' I know is gone
I do believe that I've had enough
I've had enough of the falseness
Of a worn out relation
Enough of the jealousy
And the intoleration
Oh, I make you laugh
And you make me cry
I believe it's time for me to fly
(Time for me to fly)
Oh, I've got to set myself free
(Time for me to fly)
And that's just how it's got to be
I know it hurts to say goodbye
But it's time for me to fly

Oh, don't you know it's
Time for me to fly
Oh, I've got to set myself free
(Time for me to fly)
Oh babe, that's just how it's got to be
Oh I know it hurts to say goodbye
But it's time for me to fly
It's time for me to fly
It's time for me to fly
(It's time for me to fly)
It's time for me to fly
(It's time for me to fly)
It's time for me to fly
(It's time for me to fly)
It's time for me to fly
