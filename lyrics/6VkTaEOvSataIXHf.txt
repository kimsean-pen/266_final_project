I'm lying here tonight
Thinking of the days we've had
Wondering if the world would be so beautiful
If I had not looked into your eyes

How did you know
That I've been waiting?
Never knew the world would be
So Beautiful at all

I'm spending all the days
Dreaming of the nights we've had
I never knew that love would be a miracle
When I think of all the ones before

But now that I've found you
I am flying
I never knew that love would be
So beautiful to me
I never knew that love would be
So beautiful to me

And then we danced to the rhythm
That is burning like a flame
And when you touch me
I can hardly move
You take my breath away

You give me all that I want to feel
When we become as one
And then you take me
To the heaven of your heart

Did nobody ever tell you
You're the best thing
That has ever been?

Ahh ahhh aahhh
You are so beautiful
Ahh Ahhh Ahhhh
So beautiful

I'm standing here tonight
Thinking of the times we'll have
I never knew that you would be so beautiful
From the day you came into my life

I just want to say
You make me happy
Never knew that you would be
So beautiful to me

I never knew that you would be
So beautiful to me

So beautiful to me
So beautiful to me
So beautiful to me
To me...

I'm lying here tonight...
I'm dreaming here tonight
I Dance with you tonight...
So beautiful to me...
