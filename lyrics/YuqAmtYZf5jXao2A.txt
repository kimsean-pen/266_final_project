There's no money
There's no possessions
Only obsession
I don't need that shit
Take my money
Take my obsession

I just wanna be heard
Loud and clear are my words
Comin' from within' man, tell 'em what you heard
It's about a revolution
In your heart and in your mind, you can't find the conclusion
Lifestyle and obsession
Diamond rings get you nothin' but a lifelong lesson
And you're pocket book stressin'
You're a slave to the system, workin' jobs that you hate
For that shit you don't need
It's too bad the world is based on greed
Step back and see
Stop thinkin' 'bout yourself, start thinkin' 'bout...

There's no money
There's no possession
Only obsession
I don't need that shit
Take my money
Take my possession
Take my obsession
I don't need that...

'Cos everything is nothing
And emptiness is in everything
This reality is really just a fucked-up dream
With the flesh and the blood that you call your soul
Flip it inside out, it's a big black hole
Take your money burn it up like an asteroid
Possessions, they are never gonna fill the void
Take it away and learn the best lesson
The heart, the soul, the life, the passion

There's no money
There's no possession
Only obsession
I don't need that shit
Take my money
Take my possession
Take my obsession
I don't need that shit

Money...
Possession...
Obsession...

Present yourself, press your clothes
Comb your hair and clock in
You just can't win, just can't win
The things you own, own you now!

Take my money
Take my possession
Take my obsession
I don't need that shit

Fuck your money
Fuck your possession
Fuck your obsession
I don't need that shit
Money...
Possession...
Obsession...
I don't need that shit
