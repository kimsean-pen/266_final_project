I dug up all my little secrets
What a shame, living in such regret
Suddenly I could see how needy
I'd become, desperate for some healing
You showed up just how I had seen it
In my dreams, speaking words I needed
A violent crashing from the ceiling
You reached out and you caught me from the demons

Father, save me
Take me away from hell and then
Heaven, help me
Steady my feet again

I'm running up to the altar
Drink from the water
'Til you show me some love
I am waiting
I've got a heart full of sorrow
Chest that feels hollow
And I know I need someone to save me
Oh, save my, save my
Save my soul (To the altar)
Oh, save my, save my
Save my soul (To the altar)
