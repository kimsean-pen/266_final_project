Cool hand, teller, take it easy, fella
'Cause these people won't be fooling around
Sure shot chosen, everybody knows it
'Cause tonight is going down
The room will surrender when the band comes around
You better run before they hit the ground
Heads will roll at the start of the sound
The creep show, the loudest in town

The creep show, the loudest in town
Oh, at the creep show
The creep show, the loudest in town
Oh, at the creep show

Give to me Bella, a page of your novella
But she's too busy being unwound
The room is moving, everybody tuned in
To the wave of supersonic sound
And she's had the ticket clutched in her hand
Long before you ever heard of the band
Yeah, she's had the feeling since before she could stand
Something we could never understand

At the creep show
At the creep show
At the creep show
At the creep show

C'est la vie, say you and me
C'est la vie, say the casualties
C'est la vie, say you and me

C'est la vie, say you and me
C'est la vie, say the...
