Believe in freedom, in love and fortune
And all we need is a piece of heaven
Believe in freedom, in love and fortune
And all we need is a piece of heaven

We all need love
Freedom
Come on, everybody
We all need love
Freedom
Let's live for freedom

I don't know what you're believing in
Is it love or fortune or a fight to win
I don't know to what you say, this is the thing
Is it a piece of heaven that makes you swing
Freedom is the magic word
The only thing that will never hurt
Peace like in a movie scene
We try together and start to scream

Believe in freedom, in love and fortune
And all we need is a piece of heaven
Believe in freedom, in love and fortune
And all we need is a piece of heaven

We all need love
Freedom
Come on, everybody
We all need love
Freedom
Let's live for freedom

Yes, I know you want some more
From what I said just right before
So clap your hands to the beat of the sound
Put your hands in the air and back to the ground
I never saw a jam like this before
Back to the front and door to door
If you want some more get on the floor
Love will come and that's for sure

Believe in freedom, in love and fortune
And all we need is a piece of heaven
Believe in freedom, in love and fortune
And all we need is a piece of heaven

We all need love
Freedom
Come on, everybody
We all need love
Freedom
Let's live for freedom

We all need love
We all need love

Scream and scream it out of your soul
Try to escape and get outta control
Get outta control and save your soul
Stop this violence, say no, no, no
No more pain, no more lies
No more panic in the children's eyes
Freedom, believing in
Take a piece of heaven and you will win

Believe in freedom, in love and fortune
And all we need is a piece of heaven
Believe in freedom, in love and fortune
And all we need is a piece of heaven

We all need love
Freedom
Come on, everybody
We all need love
Freedom
Let's live for freedom
We all need love
Freedom
