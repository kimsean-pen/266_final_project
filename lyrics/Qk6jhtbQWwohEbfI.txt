Please don't cry,
You know I'm leaving here tonight,
Before I go, I want you to know,
There will always be a light.

If the moon had to run away,
And all the stars didn't wanna play,
Don't waste the sun on a rainy day,
The wind will soon blow it all away. (Yeah)

So many times I'd planned
To be much more than who I am,
And If I let you down, I will follow you around,
Until you understand.

If the moon had to run away,
And all the stars didn't wanna play,
Don't waste the sun on a rainy day,
The wind will soon blow it all away. (Yeah, oh yeah)

When the days all feel the same,
Don't feel the cold or wind or rain:
Everything will be okay,
We will meet again one day.

And I will shine on for everyone.

So please don't cry,
Although I leave you here this night,
Where I go, how far I don't know,
I will always be your light

If the moon had to run away,
And all the stars didn't wanna play,
Don't waste the sun on a rainy day
The wind will soon blow it all away. (Yeah, oh yeah)

When the days all seem the same,
Don't feel the cold or wind or rain,
Everything will be okay,
We will meet again one day.

And I will shine on for everyone,
Shine on for everyone (Aaaaaaaah - aaaaaaaaah)

When the stars all look the same,
Don't feel the cold or wind or rain,
Everything will be okay,
We will meet again one day.

And I will shine on for everyone,
Shine on for everyone.
