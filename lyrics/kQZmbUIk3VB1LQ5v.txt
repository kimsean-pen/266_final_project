I should know who I am by now,
I walk, the record stands somehow
Thinking of winter
Your name is the splinter inside me while I wait

I remember the sound
Of your November downtown
And I remember the truth
A warm December with you
But I don't have to make this mistake
And I don't have to stay this way
If only I would wait

The walk has all been cleared by now
Your voice is all I hear somehow
Calling out winter
Your voice is the splinter inside me while I wait

I remember the sound
Of your November downtown
And I remember the truth
A warm December with you
But I don't have to make this mistake
And I don't have to stay this way
If only I would wait

I could have lost myself
In rough blue waters in your eyes
And I miss you still

I remember the sound,
Of your November downtown
And I remember the truth,
A warm December with you
But I don't have to make this mistake
And I don't have to stay this way
If only I would wait
