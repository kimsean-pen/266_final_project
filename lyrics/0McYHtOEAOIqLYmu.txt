Do you recall waking up
On a dirty couch in the gray fog
And the gray dog barking down the street?
Columns shake your feet beneath your feet

Do you recall, your face was white as all?
Do you bone the sheets?
Do you think of me?
Your long lost friend from the sea

How long with the heat?
How long was he?
How long was he?
How long was he?

How long was he?
How long was he?
