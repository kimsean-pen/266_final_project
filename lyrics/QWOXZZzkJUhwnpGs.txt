Silent tears
In a sea of sorrow
If only God would talk to me
And promise me tomorrow

Drowning in myself as I
Am facing imperfection
But the pain makes me feel
I am still alive

In ravenlight
You came to me
From silence rose
A symphony of coming winters white

Paralyzed
Caught in desperation
Endless nights
Revisiting
Internal conversations

Finally I made my peace
With self intoxication
So I bleed just to know
I am not alone

In ravenlight
You came to me
From silence rose
A symphony of coming winters white

May light embrace the darkest hour
Let it shine to orchestrate
The shadows of the night

In ravenlight
You came to me
From silence rose
A symphony of coming winters white

I love the way
You sing to me
From silence
To a soaring symphony
My rose in winter white
