I heard you found a new friend so quick you were to achieve,
I hope you give her good head, the kind you didn't give me,
Hear what you tell everyone just to rub it in my face,
You're so much happier now that she has taken my place.

Come take my pulse to see how much I care,
You won't get a rise out of me anywhere,
You blew our love like smoke into the air,
But I never loved you quite enough,
Loved you quite enough to even care.

It's clear what you see in her I understand it too well,
In this unbearable world we've all got some holes to fill,
Does she know we fucked on the table where the two of you eat?
Do you use all the same tricks that swept me off of my feet?

Well come take my pulse to see how much I care,
You won't get a rise out of me anywhere,
You blew our love like smoke into the air,
But I never loved you quite enough,
Loved you quite enough to even...

Sometimes I watch the rain outside and wonder if you miss me, miss me,
Sometimes I touch myself at night as if you're dreaming of me,
Oh, sometimes I hold my pillow tight and wish that you were with me, with me,
But when I see her at your side, I know I never loved you quite enough,
Loved you quite enough to even...

Come take my pulse to see how much I care,
You won't get a rise out of me anywhere,
You blew our love like smoke into the air,
But I never loved you quite enough,
Loved you quite enough to even...

Come take my pulse to see how much I care,
You won't get a rise out of me anywhere,
You blew our love like smoke into the air,
But I never loved you quite enough,
Loved you quite enough to even care.
