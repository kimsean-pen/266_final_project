A question isn't answered if an answer isn't questioned
An answer has a meaning when your meaning has a truth
past life brings a future when the future disappears
conscious of a kingdom left the king to reappear

If truth is but a burden being being burden by the few
left unto the story there's a story unto you
simply are the scriptures sing the words on city walls
right there's some freedom dropping secrets for us all

The question isn't answered if an answer isn't questioned
An answer has a meaning when your meaning has a truth
past life brings a future when the future disappears
