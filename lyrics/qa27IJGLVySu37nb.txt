It cannot be explained
Like a single membrane
Same old dream from the pillow
Laugh along with her laugh
Lying when she's lying
She gets angry I feel so
Is it any wonder I get lonesome for you?
Get out of your mind
Demons ate the dragons
She is not a dragon
But I'm afraid of her fire
My heart is a wagon
My heart is a wagon
But I can't push her desire
Is it any wonder I get lonesome for you?
Get out of your mind
Annie, my love pulls the trigger on you
Get out of your mind
And into my arms
