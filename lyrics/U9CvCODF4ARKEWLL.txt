Do you got wise blood that come when [?]
I'm an outlaw on the brink of
Self-implosion
Alone in a crowd on the corner
Going nowhere slow

I'm an outlaw on the brink of
Self-implosion
Alone in a crowd on the corner
In my walkman in a snowglobe
Going nowhere slow

I'm an outlaw by the ocean
Watch it come crashing against my skin
He pulled from Gene Clark to Clarence White
And then he's alright

I'm an outlaw on the brink of
Imploding
Alone in a crowd on the corner
Burned from vinyl, dimed from cans, peaked to the dome

I'm an outlaw under Orion's belt
Dumb thing to sing but it had a ring to it
Do you got wise blood [?]
As my eardrum drums on through the night now

Under exile, the constellations
Just-a-idling in slow motion
So is the life of the outlaw
[?] human being
