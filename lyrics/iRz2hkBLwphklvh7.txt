I trust that everything that happened to us
Happened so we'd improve
Everything is proof
Everything you do

But you've got the softest arms i have ever known
The softest arms that i could hold
Or that could hold me

Travel far away
Where the neighbors talk
And i'll go away
To an adjacent park
I want to go to doose's market
Or anywhere there's a doose's

Because even the softest arms
Can't bear to hold
Such a fragile frame
Such a broken soul
I've got a broken soul

(i'm alive, and with your body close to mine,
i am suddenly occupied with the reasons that i could try to be
something that you would like.
like a star in the open sky. like a beam of light)
