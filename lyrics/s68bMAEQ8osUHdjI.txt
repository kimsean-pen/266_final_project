Lay your secrets down
Taste of violet found
Tumble fingers silent through your garden
Hardly breathing feeding almost started
Climbing up on your heartache
Tearing all of your cottons down
you're asking me to wait
Lay it down in my wolf haste
Take it all if you feed me now
you're asking me to wait
But you're asking me to wait
Lakes of fire found
Hardly breathing feeding almost on me
you're asking me too
you're asking me too
you're asking me too
you're asking me to wait
Climbing up on your heartache
you're asking me to wait
Tearing all of your cottons down
you're asking me to wait
Lay it down in my wolf haste
you're asking me to wait
Take it all if you feed me now
you're asking me to wait
But you're asking me to wait
you're asking me to wait
you're asking me too
you're asking me too
