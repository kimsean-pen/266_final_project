Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
And let me know what love is like
On Jupiter and Mars

In other words, hold my hand
In other words, Darling kiss me

And fill my heart with joy
And let me sing forever more
Cause you are all I've wanted
All I've worshiped and all I've adored

In other words please be true
In other words, In other words
In other words, I love you

And fill my heart with joy
And let me sing forever more
Cause you are all I've wanted
All I've worshiped and all I've adored

In other words please be true
In other words, In other words
In other words, I love you

Something like that
