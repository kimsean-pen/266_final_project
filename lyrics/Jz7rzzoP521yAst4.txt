People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
And lady stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace

And he was alright, the band was all together
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
He was awful nice
Really quite out of sight, he sang all night long

Femme fatals emerged from shadows
To watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs
To make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
Lady stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and dismay

And he was alright, the band was all together
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight and he sang all night, all night long

Ooh how I sighed when they asked if I knew his name

Though he was alright, the song went on forever
Yes he was alright a song went on together
Yes he sang awful nice
Really quite paradise, he sang all night, all night long
Long song
