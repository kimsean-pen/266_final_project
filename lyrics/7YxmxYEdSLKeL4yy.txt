we can sit around this fire
and let our spirits ride on out
watch it as a flame gets higher
i can see it in your eyes
whispers on the rise
slip into the same old dream every night
welcome all the things that could've been
i cannot afford this fight with my wit
interstellar space got broken in
remember how we'd sleep so still
trees were singing love songs
drowning in the maze of a summer
i can see it in your eyes
whispers on the rise
slip into the same old dream every night
welcome all the things that could've been
i cannot afford this fight with my wit
interstellar space got broken in
we can sit around this fire
and let our spirits ride on out
watch it as a flame gets higher
i can see it in your eyes
whispers on the rise
slip into the same old dream every night
welcome all the things that could've been
i cannot afford this fight with my wit
interstellar space got broken in
