I am Zodiac, I am the stars
You are the sorceress, my priestess of Mars
Queen of the night, swathed in satin black
Your ivory flesh upon my torture rack

My Venus in furs
To your leather boots I offer prayers
You rise like a cobra, evil dressed in furs
But your venom, a black drug inside my veins
I need it everyday to take away the pain
My Venus in furs

I am Zodiac, I am the stars
You are the sorceress, Venus in furs

I am Zodiac, I am the stars
You are the sorceress, Venus in furs

I am Zodiac, I am Zodiac
I am Zodiac, I am Zodiac
I am Zodiac, I am Zodiac
I am Zodiac, I am Zodiac
I am Zodiac, I am Zodiac
I am Zodiac, I am Zodiac
I am Zodiac, I am Zodiac
I am Zodiac, I am Zodiac
I am Zodiac
