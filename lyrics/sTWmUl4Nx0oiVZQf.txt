I took the train back,
back to where I came from.
I took it all alone, it's been so long, I know.
Imagine me there my heart asleep with no air.
Begging ocean please, help me drown these memories.

All I need to hear is that you're not mine, you're not mine.

I'm moving east then,
somewhere far away from the sight of my hands,
the sight of me not moving.
You can't just hop a plane and come and visit me again.
I claim it's in my head and I regret offering.

All I need to hear is that you're not mine, you're not mine.
All I want to hear is that you're not mine, you're not mine.

You take a second, take a second
take a year, take a year
you took me out and took me in
and told me all of this and then
you take a moment, you take a moment,
you take a year, you take a year,
you helped me out, I listened in,
you taught me all of this and then.

All I want to hear is that you're not mine, you're not mine.
All I want to hear is that you're not mine, you're not mine.
All I need to hear is that you're not mine, you're not mine.
All I want to hear is that you're not mine, you're not mine.
