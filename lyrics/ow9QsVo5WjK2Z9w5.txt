Wasted bodies lying o-oh so still
So many lovers in need of organs
Wasted bodies lying o-oh so still
So many lovers in need of organs

He couldn't help himself
The lonely neighbor
Invited him for pies
Soon was between her thighs
While in search for him
His lover barged right in
A Colt 45
Cold gunned them riding

Lovers in the dust
Lovers in the dust
Dancing in decay
Dancing in decay

Lovers in the dust
Lovers in the dust
Dancing in decay
Dancing in decay

Lovers in the dust

After all these years
She'd been Polyamourous
93 lovers
Under several of bed covers
Deceit ate her up
She invited them for coffe
With some TNT
Blew them and the whole shop up

Wasted bodies lying o-oh so still
So many lovers in need of organs
Wasted bodies lying o-oh so still
So many lovers in need of organs

Lovers in the dust
Lovers in the dust
Dancing in decay
Dancing in decay

Lovers in the dust
Lovers in the dust
Lovers in the dust
Dancing in decay

Lovers in the Dust
