You're running, running away from me
There's so much, so much that we could be
But you seem terrified of what you feel inside
You're running, running away from me

Like love is a bad word

You're holding, holding your tongue with me
You're causing a state of emergency
I need your voice right now
To wash away my doubt
You're holding, holding your tongue

Like love is a bad word

I can't help but wonder what's been on your mind, yeah
Like you're sabotaging every time it's right
I don't understand why you lie
You've been getting wasted 'cause you don't wanna face this

You're holding, holding your tongue with me
You're causing a state of emergency
Love is a bad word
