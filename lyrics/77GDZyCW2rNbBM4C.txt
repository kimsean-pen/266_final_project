There's nothing better than this,
dressed in our predatory skins,
our blood so thin
our blood so thin
we could never win
we could never win

We'll be awake for days
We'll be awake for days

I'd have pulled you into the storm when you told me your real name.
I'd have soaked you through
I'd have soaked you through

We'll be awake for days
We'll be awake for days
We'll be awake for days in a sudden rain,
reeled in by the heat of the prey.
The body aches
The body aches as it craves
The body aches as it craves

the heat of the prey
the heat of the prey

They said you were anguine,
in the crowd you could have been slithering
and I could see you were hungry
as you wrapped yourself around me

We'll be awake for days
We'll be awake for days
We'll be awake for days in a sudden rain,
reeled in by the heat of the prey
The body aches
The body aches as it craves
The body aches as it craves

the heat of the prey
the heat of the prey
