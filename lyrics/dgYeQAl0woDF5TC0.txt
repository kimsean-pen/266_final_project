I will happily play along with you
Sit here quietly, smile like it's true
Smile like it's true
Play along with you

Lines written from my head
I recite them as we speak
Spoke like suddenly, it starts to fade on me
Starts to fade on me
And I'm struggling to speak

When the sky turns turns from blue
Starts to rain on you
And the sun's in your eyes
And you start to wonder why
Jasmine it's true
I waited here for you
Without this heart of mine
You'll be doing fine
You'll be doing fine

Will you happily play along with me?
Sit here quietly, and your smile's hard to see
Smile's hard to see
Won't you play along with me?

When the sky turns from blue
Starts to rain on you
And the sun's in your eyes
You start to wonder why
Jasmine, it's true, I waited here for you
Without this heart of mine
You'll be doing fine, you'll be doing fine

When the sky turns from blue
Starts to rain on you
And the sun's in your eyes
And you start to wonder why
Jasmine, it's true, I waited here for you
Without this heart of mine...

When the sky turns from blue
Starts to rain on you
And the sun's in your eyes
And you start to wonder why
Jasmine, it's true, I waited here for you
Without this heart of mine
You'll be doing fine
You'll be doing fine
