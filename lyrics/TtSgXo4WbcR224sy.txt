If anything like the self destructed
If ever alike inside you're scraping, the pockets avail
Whatever you're like when you came in

Whatever your acronym

They say that either you're out or you're in
But you're on
They say that either you're out or you swim
When you're on

Teach them how you moved around
You tell them all so well, I had to memorize
You poured a few tears - there's ground and there's your feet
And never they shall meet

If anything like the self destructed
If ever alike inside you're scraping, the pockets avail
Whatever you're like when you came in

Whatever your acronym

If anything like the self destructed
If ever alike inside you're scraping, the pockets avail
Whatever you're like when you came in

Whatever your acronym

They say that either you're out or you're in
But you're on!
They say that either you're out or you swim
But you're on!

What if we started to what became
Don't get found out again
What if we're starting what remains
You set our lives again

They say that either you're out or you're in
But you're on!
They say that either you're out or you swim
But you're on!

Don't get found out again!
