Lonely stranger â€“ Who are you?
Interchanger, passing through
Loveless victim holding on
Insides twisted all along

Can't see my reflection
Nothing left to recognize
Here I stand, no connection
A foreign place with no allies

Lucid visions cloud my mind
Violent collision, intertwined
Imagination, control the time
In this moment you'll be mine

Can't see my reflection
Nothing left to recognize
Here I stand, no connection
A foreign place with no allies
Here I stand, interchanger
Passing through, passing through
