Gypsy woman told my mama
While 'fore I was born

Got a boy child comin' mama
He'll be a bad one, now
I'll make all you little girls
Turn your heads around
Then I'm gonna take you little girls
Gonna take you right on down... with me yeah
Ho, you just wait and see
I'll be your Hoochie Coochie Man
I'll set you free
On the seventh hour of the seventh day
On the seventh month, seven doctors they say
I've got lots of good luck, you know they all agree
But now if ya, if you're lookin' for trouble babe
You better not mess with me
Hey, 'cause you know I'll getcha one by one
Ain't no fun.
I'm that old Hoochie Coochie Man
A bad son of a gun
Got a John the conqueroot and got some mojo too
We got a black cat born, we're gonna slip it to you
Hey, move over people just as fast as you can
Said I know you're waitin' for me 'cause I'm the Hoochie Coochie Man
I'm gonna get you, one by one
I got set on that old Hoochie Coochie Man
And I'm yo' son of a gun
Now the gypsy woman told mama, oh 'while 'fore I was born
She said you know he's comin' mama, he'll be a bad, very bad one
Make all the ladies, turn their heads around
You said, I can just see all those women, chasin' him all down
I'm your Hoochie Coochie Man, everybody knows it
