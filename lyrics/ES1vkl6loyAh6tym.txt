Music making me loose it
Baby come on
Baby come on
Music you can't refuse it
It's in your blood
It's in your blood
In every vein
In every heartbeat
And through my brain
It keeps on pumping, pumping
Sway
Let it surround you
In every way
And feel it pumping, pumping
Let's not over-analyze it
Just surrender shouldn't fight it, woah, oh, oh
Peace and Love Rock 'n' Roll
Anything is possible, woah, oh, oh
Music making me lose it
Baby come on
Baby come on
Music you can't refuse it
It's in your blood
It's in your blood
Hey
Music, music, music
Music, music, music
It fills my soul
It's got my body
Under control
I feel it pumping, pumping
Oh
Feeling the power
Pulsate and flow
Into your bones
Let's not over-analyze it
Just surrender, shouldn't fight it, woah, oh, oh
Peace and Love, Rock 'n' Roll
Anything is possible, woah, oh, oh
Music making me lose it
Baby come on
Baby come on
Music you can't refuse it
It's in your blood
It's in your blood
Hey
Music, music, music
Music, music, music
Music, music, music
Music, music, music
Mind over matter
Music over mind
Mind over matter
Music over mind
Mind over matter
Music over mind
Mind over matter
Music over mind, oh
Music making me lose it
Baby come on
Baby come on
Music you can't refuse it
It's in your blood
It's in your blood
Hey
Music, music, music
Music, music, music
Music, music, music, yeah
Music, music, music
It's in your blood
Music, music, music
