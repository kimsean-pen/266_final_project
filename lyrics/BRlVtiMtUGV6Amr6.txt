I'm the kinda girl
That your boyfriend misses
I'm the kinda girl
That your girlfriend disses
I'm the kinda girl
That drives you mad (waw)
I'm the kinda girl
That you wish you had
When i'm in the club
I get in for free
I'm the kinda girl
In the VIP
I'm the kinda girl
That likes to have fun
If you're that kinda boy
Then come and get some

I'm that type of girl
Are you
That type of boy? [x2]

I'm the kinda girl
That doesn't do dishes
I'm the kinda girl
To grant your wishes
I'm the kinda girl
That your girlfriend hates (waw)
I'm the kinda girl
That your boyfriend dates
And you know that i will taste delicious

I'm the type of girl
That doesn't get suspicious
I'm the kinda girl
That likes to have fun
If you're the kinda boy
Then come and get some

I'm that type of girl
Are you
That type of boy? [x4]

When i say i'm that type of girl
It means i'm as nasty as i wanna be
Not what you tell me to be
Cos i'm an independent girl
And i get what i want
And if i don't get it
It's cos i don't want it

I'm that type of girl
Are you
That type of boy? [x6]
