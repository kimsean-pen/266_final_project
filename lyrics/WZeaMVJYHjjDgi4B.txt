KABOOM
Get it right
Get it right now
Get it right
Do it good
Get it right now

KABOOM
Get it right

Oh let's bomb the factory
That makes all the wannabes
Let's burst all the bubbles
That brainwash the masses

As far as I can tell
It doesn't matter who you are
If you can believe there's something worth fighting for
The color of an eye
The glory of a sudden view
The baby in your arms
The smile he always shoots at you

Believing (believing) in nothing (in nothing)
Makes life (makes life) so boring (so boring)
So let's pray (so let's pray) for something (for something)
To feel good (to feel good) in the morning (in the morning)

As far as I can tell
It doesn't matter who you are
If you can believe there's something worth fighting for
The color of an eye
The glory of a sudden view
The baby in your arms
The smile he always shoots at you

KABOOM
Get it right
Get it right now
Get it right
Do it good
Get it right now

KABOOM
Get it right
Get it right now
Get it right
Do it good
Get it right now

Oh doctor we're dying
There's no use in crying
So live for tomorrow
And do what you have to

As far as I can tell
It doesn't matter who you are
If you can believe there's something worth fighting for
The color of an eye
The glory of a sudden view
The baby in your arms
The smile he always shoots at you

So let's pray (so let's pray) for something (for something)
To feel good (to feel good) in the morning (in the morning)
