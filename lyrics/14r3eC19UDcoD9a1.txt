I'm the cat with bass and drum, going 'round like Bom Bom Bom!
What's grooving? I'm moving. I like you're style of Womping!
How charming! Just a rapper, load him up and eat that snapper!
I want 16 pints of rum and then I go Bom Bom!

Going up in the dark of the night and so I go ooh ah ah ah ah. I...
I've got a pie in my pocket, pie in my pocket, an eye in my socket.
you've got life, you've got style, you've got nothing on my mind.
but I'm so cool, I'm so groovin', when I go Bom Bom Bom!

Going around like Bom Bom Bom!
I'm so cool, I'm so groovin', when I go Bom Bom Bom!

I've brought a pie in my pocket, pie in my pocket, an eye in my socket.
you've got life, you've got style, you've got nothing on my mind.
but I'm so cool, I'm so groovin, when I go Bom Bom Bom!

I'm so cool, I'm so groovin, when I go Bom Bom Bom!
Bom Bom Bom!
I'm so cool, I'm so groovy, when I go Bom Bom Bom!
