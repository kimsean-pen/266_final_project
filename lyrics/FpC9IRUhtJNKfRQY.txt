Riding in darkness through the Hell of the night
Give all your torment to the heaven's might
In the name of Satan, spread all your fear
You feel his anger, you know he's here

Casting a spell
Lord of all Hells
Ripping the angels
God has fell

Tormentor

Baphomet's calling, death is now real
Hell dogs and demons waiting to kill
Pentagrams shining, Lucifer smiles
Fucking the virgin, rip out her eyes

Drinking the blood
Fear no God
Now you are dead
Your flesh is dot rot
