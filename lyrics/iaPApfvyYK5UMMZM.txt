This town's been raining for too long
For me to find my way to you
You see me everywhere
I see you in my boots
And in my hair and in my pair
For you is such that we could
Never find the lover way to be

Every time that we walk the streets
I try my best to keep up with the beat
You're everything that I never could keep
I hear the sound and it starts to repeat

Oh, oh oh

It's there in everywhere that we could meet
And even when we're out of sorts

We carry you, I always talk so
Just a sport to move toward

Every time that we walk the streets
I try my best to keep up with the beat
You're everything that I never could keep
I hear the sound and it starts to repeat

Oh, oh oh

Underneath a burning tree
That is where she brought me
That is where she bound me
Nobody found me

Underneath a burning tree
That is where she brought me
That is where she bound me
Nobody found me
