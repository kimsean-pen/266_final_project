My, my, you busted me
Like a Robocop, strike me
With your riding crop I'm forever going celibate tomorrow
Tonight like success knows no shame

Oh no, she's a rejecter
I must protect myself

There's the girl that left me bitter
Want to pay some other girl
To just walk up to her and hit her
But I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't

My, my, this demon heart
Of the master's hand, crush me
Why, I don't understand and I know you're not her
'Cause the girl of my dreams is probably god, still I want you

Oh no, she's a rejecter
I must protect myself

There's the girl that left me bitter
Want to pay some other girl
To just walk up to her and hit her
But I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't

I can't just hit her
No, no, no, no, no
I won't hit her
I can't, I can't, I can't

No, I can't, I can't, I can't
No, no, I can't, I can't, I can't
