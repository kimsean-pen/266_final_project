Miss me, miss me, miss me, miss me
Miss me, miss me, miss me, miss me, miss me
Miss me, miss me, miss me, miss me
Miss me, miss me, miss me, miss me, miss me

Blunt loaded like a full clip
Swag sauce on full drip
Miss me with the bullshit
Miss, miss me with the bullshit
Looking like "Who this?"
Talking 'bout it but they never gon' do shit
Miss me with the bullshit
Miss, miss me with the bullshit

Charged up like a Tesla
Out here mad stuck like a Mexican wrestler
This a gift from God, baby, I'm just a messenger
Elevator flow, 47 gon' level up
Lord knows I been through hell to put it on
So if a war dem want, mother trucker, then bring it on
Sometimes I can't believe I'm the one
They was sleeping on, to each his own
I deserve a queen, you pick a throne, I'm sitting on
And you know I brought the whole crew
Just in case you niggas try to get brand new
You never seen me lose my cool
My pen's on point, got you under voodoo

Blunt loaded like a full clip
Swag sauce on full drip
Miss me with the bullshit
Miss, miss me with the bullshit
Looking like "Who this?"
Talking 'bout it but they never gon' do shit
Miss me with the bullshit
Miss, miss me with the bullshit

Everybody want the glory
But they don't wanna put the work in to keep it all g
Switched the number up so them niggas can't call
'Cause I hate a pessimist, can't stand a sob story
Lord knows I been through hell to put it on
So all you crab niggas in the barrel can move along
When y'all looking for applause
Man, I'm looking for summer homes, to each his own
And this why you always gon' need a loan, leave me alone

Blunt loaded like a full clip
Swag sauce on full drip
Miss me with the bullshit
Miss, miss me with the bullshit
Looking like "Who this?"
Talking 'bout it but they never gon' do shit
Miss me with the bullshit
Miss, miss me with the bullshit

Miss me, miss me
Miss me, miss me
Miss me, miss me, miss me
Miss me, miss me
Full clip, full drip
Miss me
Bullshit
Miss me
Who this
Do shit
Miss me
Bullshit

(Miss me with the bullshit)
Miss me, miss me
Miss me, miss me
Miss me, miss me
Miss me, miss me, miss me
