I know a girl who's tough but sweet
She's so fine, she can't be beat
Got everything that I desire
Sets the summer sun on fire

I want Candy, I want Candy

Go to see her when her hairs hung down
Ain't no finer girl in town
Candy's just what the doctor ordered
She's so sweet, she makes my mouth water

I want Candy, I want Candy

Ohhh, I want Candy, Ohhh
Hey
I want Candy, Candy, I want Candy

Her hair hang down
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey

Candy on the beach, there's nothing better
But I like Candy when it's wrapped in a sweater
Some day soon I'll make you mine,
Then I'll have Candy all the time

I want Candy, I want Candy
I want Candy, I want Candy

Yehh
Ohh
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey - I want Candy
Ohh, yeehh
Ohh, yeehh - Want Candy
I want Candy
