In a dream I was away with you
Sky was black and your heart was blue
Nothing to see and nothing to do
How I wish this all could be true
It will work everytime
(It will work everytime)
(It will work everytime)

(It will work everytime)

You will see yourself alive
You will see your light arrive
(You wil see yourself alive)
(You will see your...)
