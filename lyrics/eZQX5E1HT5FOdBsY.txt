Open your arms to the lonely shine
Lonesome as gold in a poor man's smile
See how the moon is full, follow the push and pull
Follow the ebb and flow in the breathing tide
Come on moonchild you're so far away tonight
The door is falling open and we're flying wild
Cat on the road, down in the living night
See how the black dog grins in the diamond light
We're dreaming and we're real, we're broken and we're healed
Give in to what you feel over what you see
Come on moonchild, you're so far away tonight
The door is falling open and we're flying wild
Come on moon flower, you're so far away from now
You could bloom forever in the hour
And when if is only yes and no, and now becomes too soon
I know you'll be alright if you only come away to the moon
In the blue shine
Come on moonchild you're so far away tonight
The door is falling open and we're flying wild
Come on moon flower you're so far away from now
You could bloom forever in the hour
