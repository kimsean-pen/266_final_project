Hang up all your ties and all the phones
We can't let her, let her be alone
All night, we waited up through the storm
For you to come let us know that you'd come home
Oh please, tell us about all the things you have seen
About all your visions and all of your dreams
It seems to me
That you're set free
It seems to be
The only possibility

Who am I to say what is to come
From all the things that I have yet to learn
All night, we waited up through the storm
For you to come let us know that you'd come home
Oh please, tell us about all the things you have seen
About all your visions and all of your dreams
It seems to me
That you're set free
It seems to be
The only possibility
