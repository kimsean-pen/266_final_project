I went to see a rabbi
But despite his advice
I want an operation
I will not father life

Operation, operation
Snip and tie, snip and tie
Operation, operation
Snip and tie, snip and tie

They send me to a preacher
A really thoughtful guy
He said my idea's crazy
I shouldn't even try

This operation, operation
Snip and tie, snip and tie
Operation, operation
Snip and tie, snip and tie

But I've just seen a surgeon
And with a knife he cut
I cannot bring you children
This world is such a rut

Yeah, operation, operation
Snip and tie, snip and tie
Operation, operation
Snip and tie, snip and tie

I had an operation
A statement of our times
They tied my balls together
What's inside is not alive

Operation, operation
Snip and tie, snip and tie
Operation, operation
Snip and tie, snip and tie

Operation, operation
Snip and tie, snip and tie
Operation, operation
Snip and tie, snip and tie
