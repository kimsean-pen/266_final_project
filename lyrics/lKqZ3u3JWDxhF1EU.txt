Hot nights
Mystify
Yeah we're all about it
Don't tell cast a spell
Ain't no way around it
Mermaids wanna play
'Cause we're so hypnotic
Ooh

One touch
They're in love
Call me Aphrodite
Too rare not to stare
They all wanna try me
You say she's okay
But there's no one like me
Ooh

Aah
Everything we do is magic
Aah
We make other girls look tragic
Calling all goddesses (yeah) (Calling)

(Calling all goddesses) Get loud
For the crowd
Flashes pop the cameras
Taboo got my dues
Shot at Cleopatra
Stand up you're with us
They know all about ya
Ooh

Sirens
On a mission
To make it happen
We don't need to pose
It's not in our fashion
Unleash all we need
Is a heart to blacken
Ooh

Aah
Everything we do is magic
Aah
We make other girls look tragic
Calling all goddesses (yeah) (Calling)

Calling all goddesses We rule the world
All eyes on us
Get it girls
Calling all goddesses
We rule the world
All eyes on us
Get it girls
Calling all goddesses Calling all goddesses (yeah) (Calling)

We rule the world
All eyes on us
Get it girls
Calling all goddesses
We rule the word
All eyes on us
Get it girls
Calling all goddesses
