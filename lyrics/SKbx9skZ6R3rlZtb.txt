I think you're real groovy, baby
You think I am dumb and lazy
Maybe I will show you how well
I can write a song
That's how the guys all get the ladies
Don't they? Or does it work the other way?
Maybe I should just find better things to say

I do what I have to
I do it to have you

Here's a game that we can play
Where we try to find
Single solid reason why
I've gone and lost my mind
Hey, how bout this way?
I drank the kool-aid
I thought that it would make me cool enough for your taste
Or less of a fool enough to say "no, thanks"

But I do what I have to
I do it to have you

My infatuation's fading
Chemically more sound
Pulse is slowing, vision clearing
I'm getting it now
Then I somehow make you smile
And it's like I won a prize at the carnival
Red lights flashing, head back in the clouds
