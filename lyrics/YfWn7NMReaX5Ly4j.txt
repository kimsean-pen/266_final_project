Leave your - hanging out on a clothes line
Play peek-a-boo through a slit like blinds
And seen his little meat __
Up _ street time to retreat
___ hit the door like road runner
No __ no __ on my block
Your condom fit like a skittle in a sock
I havent had a tater tot since I ate school lunch
So you can eat the while I _ these blunts

All I want is - and then some
Too strict like ___ on Halloween
Pull up to Banks like __
Broke ones wont get very far with me
Cheap is what I find hard to be
