I called the clinic and they said it was a three-week wait
'But the doctor'll give you
something just to get you through the day.'
I'm scared, I've never felt like this before
The only way I can stop from crying is
to take deep breaths and sit on the floor

I woke early this morning 'cause my appointment was today
She asked me what I've been up to and if everything's okay
I said 'Frustration passes through me
The way that wind shakes trees.'

When the panic set in, it was all I knew
The sadness washed my skin and shaking grew
When the panic set in, it was all I knew
The sadness washed my skin and shaking grew

She asked me to go home, unclench my fists
Think of everything that's stressful and start a list
I thought, 'Yeah, if I could actually see my life
Maybe I could compartmentalise the dark and the light.'

I woke up early that Tuesday as I did then every week
And the more times that I did that, the less I felt like a freak
But I got added to the fixed list even though I struggle still

When the panic set in, it was all I knew
The sadness washed my skin and shaking grew
When the panic set in, it was all I knew
The sadness washed my skin and shaking grew

I used to have friends
I used to know why
I felt sad, if I ever did
But now I feel that all the time

I used to have friends
I used to know why
I felt sad, if I ever did
But now I feel that all the time

When the panic set in, it was all I knew
The sadness washed my skin and shaking grew
When the panic set in, it was all I knew
The sadness washed my skin and shaking grew
