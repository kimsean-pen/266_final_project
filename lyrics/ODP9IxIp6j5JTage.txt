Is that your head upon my shoulder?
Where you lead I go, I told ya
There can be no danger
Hey stranger
Tell me if the feeling flows both ways
Help me find a way round through this maze
Light me up and keep me high for days
Never let it go down
Slow down

Maybe you my perfect rhyme
Make it feel like summertime
Take me to the finish line
Gimme a sign, gimme a sign

Now it's only you and me
All I see is you and me

As we walk around
In this strange new town, I'm lost
In the heat and sound
And we talk and laugh
About our fears and doubts -
And watch - the world
I wonder why, why
Ahh
You make me smile, smile
Ahh

You say "I guess I must've known ya
In some past life, we're not strangers"
I don't think I blame ya
I feel the same tug

Open up a beer and read my mind
Throw away your cares get down tonight
Seems as if i've known you all my life
Spin me all the way round, hey now

Maybe you my perfect rhyme
Make it feel like summertime
Take me to the finish line
Gimme a sign, gimme a sign

You make me high like a melody
Tie dye my memory
Deep breath I count to three
Yeah i'm playing it cool

Fly on the ocean breeze
Coming up like ecstasy
Can't fight, no remedy
We breaking all the rules

Now it's only you and me
All I see is you and me

Now it's only you and me
All I see is you and me
