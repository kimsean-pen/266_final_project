Don't you make a move tonight
You can only stagger
Once she's got you in her sight
You're the one she's after

'Cause she's the blade and you're just paper
And you're afraid cause she's got closer
You're backstepping and she's backstabbing
Everything in your life

She stole everything your heart desired
Now you want it back
She stole everything your heart desired
Now you want it back, go!

One by one you count the fights
Doesn't even matter
That she's got you by surprise
Misery's your master

'Cause she's the blade and you're just paper
And you're afraid cause she's got closer
You're backstepping and she's out wrecking
Everything in your life

She stole everything your heart desired
Now you want it back
She stole everything your heart desired
Now you want it back

She stole everything, she controlled everthing
She stole everything, she controlled everthing

She's the blade
She's the blade
She's the blade and your just paper
She's the blade and your just.

'Cause she's the blade and you're just paper
And you're afraid cause she's got closer

She stole everything your heart desired
Now you want it back
She stole everything your heart desired
Now you want it back

She stole everything, she controlled everthing
She stole everything and controlled everthing
