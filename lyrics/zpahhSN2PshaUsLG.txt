(Let me introduce myself)

Lookin' in your eyes, makes me wonder how
I got so much time, with you and there's more around
I know all the competition that's after you
So I get to thinking, is this too good to be true

That we're living
In a fairytale no malice in our lives
Baby oh, it's hard to believe
All the love you have inside is only mine
That's how I know

I can't, be your, only one
No I can't, be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better, how could anyone forget
No I can't

I can't, be your, only one
No I can't, be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better, how could anyone forget
No I can't

As I'm layin' down, with you every night
It still gets to me, that you remain by my side
I ain't saying that I'm not deservin' of you
But I was dreaming, bigger than I ever knew when

I wished for living
In a fairytale no malice and no lies
Baby oh, it's hard to believe
All the love you have to give inside is only mine
That's how I know

I can't, be your, only one
No I can't, be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better, how could anyone forget
No I can't

I can't, be your, only one
No I can't, be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better, how could anyone forget
No I can't

Only one
Be your only one
Only one
