I wanna run away
I wanna get away
but I will never get up
oh won't you help me up
I rely on oxygen
I depend on the bitter snow
I rely on oxygen
I depend on the bitter cold
I want to know
why it hurts to stay
and hurts to go away
will I be ok?
Crawled out of the mud
this filth you called your love
slept for countless days
but I will be ok
I wanna run away
I wanna get away
but I will never get up
oh won't you help me up
I rely on oxygen

I depend on the bitter snow
I rely on oxygen
I depend on the bitter cold
I didn't know I could feel this low
so afraid that I'll watch you go
I didn't know I could feel this low
so afraid that I'll watch you go
Take my strength out
but I'm not down
Write this reverse
I'm not down
I wanna run away
I wanna get away
but I will never get up
oh won't you help me up
Take my strength out
but I'm not down
Write this reverse
I'm not down
