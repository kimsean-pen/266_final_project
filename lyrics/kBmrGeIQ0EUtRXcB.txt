To look up into the night's sky, to see the stars they are changed
To know a thousand years or more have passed, and I am the same
This mountain hollow that keeps me in a suffocating embrace
A prison and a safe haven, it's always been this way

Lo, a new master calls me to awakening, I know this one brings the end
Far out beyond the darkness I've been living in it's true, a whole new world awaits

Stellar constellations rise, lighting my way in the night
Once again revitalized, to roam; to never die

My path begins with the new dawn; a voice is calling my name
It always starts as whispering then manifests to a scream
I'm drawn to the creature that wakes me, bound to them by the curse
My soul exists only to serve, a covenant of birth

Fear not the task ahead there's no escaping it, there's no good nor evil here

Stellar constellations rise, lighting my way in the night
Once again revitalized, to roam; to never die

Come to me, awakening
Follow my voice, come to me

Fear not the task ahead there's no escaping it, there's no good nor evil here

Stellar constellations rise, lighting my way in the night
Once again revitalized, to roam; to never

Lighting my way in the night
To roam; to never die
