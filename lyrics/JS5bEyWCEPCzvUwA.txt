What could we do
A strange attraction, deep affection
We played it cool
We tried to hide it, but couldn't deny it
Carried away
Against the ocean, more than devotion
And now we just sway
Up and down the motion of the waves

They see us floating and think we are broken
But you know and I know together we're golden
Go where the light is, darkness behind us
Now the time is on our side

We will always rise again
Victorious
Even down to the wire
We will make it through the fire
We will never fall again
Victorious
Even if it's hard to hold on
Remember we are grown to be strong
You and me victorious

Victorious
Even if it's hard to hold on
Remember we are grown to be strong
You and me victorious

They see us floating and think we are broken
But you know and I know together we're golden
Go where the light is, darkness behind us
Now the time is on our side

Victorious
Even if it's hard to hold on
Remember we are grown to be strong
You and me victorious

What could we do
A strange attraction, deep affection
We played it cool
We tried to hide it, but couldn't deny it
Carried away
Against the ocean, more than devotion
And now we just sway
Up and down the motion of the waves

We will always rise again
Victorious
Even down to the wire
We will make it through the fire
We will never fall again
Victorious
Even if it's hard to hold on
Remember we are grown to be strong
You and me victorious
