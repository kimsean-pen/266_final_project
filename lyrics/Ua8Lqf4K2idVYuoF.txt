When I saw you, scared of you
Always had to seek the truth
So, if you want to find love though
Don't look back, I'll reach for you

Can we get higher?
Can we get higher?
Can we get high tonight?
Can we get higher?
Can we get high?

When I saw you, scared of you
Always had to seek the truth
So, if you want to find love through
Don't look back, I'll reach for you

Can we get higher?
Can we get higher?
Can we get high tonight?
Can we get higher?
Can we get high?

Can we get higher?
Can we get higher?
Can we get high tonight?
Can we get higher?
Can we get high?
