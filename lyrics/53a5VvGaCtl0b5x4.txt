Mom and dad parted ways
We were young and got good grades then
Trees in yards meant to climb
We left home and never looked behind

To feel alone
We feel alone

You and I parted ways
I don't think I'll ever see your face
We latch on to a heart
Meant to hold but we get torn apart

To feel alone
We feel alone
