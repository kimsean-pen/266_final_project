Beneath the age-old citadel
Restless black waters churn
With waves of mad whispers
From sources seldom spoken of
Forever the enchanting waves
Surge and curse all men
Eager to swallow and devour
Those who mortal dwell

Seven out of seven times
The unknown in the depths
Shall embrace the drowning
With death's cold bliss
And seven out of seven times
That man will become nothing
He had not already willed
In his deepest desires

To enter the sunken temple
The black onyx ziggurat
As it manifested in vision
From the womb of void
The abyss shall gaze into you
Within the subconscious
Beyond the consecrated gate
Of one's den of vices
