In midair floating off to space
I'm moving in your hair
Is falling all around my face
Like a parachute
I'm breathing in, you're breathing out the same
We give and take
And let the water fall on the flame
It's not burning out

I'll keep you warm, dancing in a downpour
And I'll hold your body slowly turning
I'll keep you warm, dancing in a downpour
And breath it in and take it off and soak our skin
She's in a town that holds a lonely road
And the night is falling
There's a road that follows to her home
And the sky is heavy

In the home she's in a lonely room

With music playing
Can she hear my heart coming through
On the door between
I'll keep you warm, dancing in a downpour
And I'll hold your body slowly turning
I'll keep you warm, dancing in a downpour

And breath it in and take it off and soak our skin
Maybe I'll find you, maybe I won't

Maybe I'll try to even if I don't
You are what I never knew I needed
What I never knew I needed
What I never knew I needed
We're almost there
I'll keep you warm, dancing in a downpour

And I'll hold your body slowly turning
I'll keep you warm, dancing in a downpour
And breath it in and take it off and soak our skin
Soak our skin
