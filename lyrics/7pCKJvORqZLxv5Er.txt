Was it you who spoke the words that
Things would happen but not to me
Oh things are gonna happen naturally
Oh taking your advice and I'm
Looking on the bright side
And balancing the whole thing

Oh but at often times those words get tangled up in lines
And the bright light turns to night
Oh until the dawn it brings
Another day to sing about the magic that was you and me

'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
Others only read of the love
Oh the love that I love, yeah

See I'm all about them words
Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words
Hundreds of pages, pages, pages for words
More words than I had ever heard and I
Feel so alive

'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Oh love oh

You and I you and I
Not so little you and I any more
And with this silence brings a moral story more importantly evolving
Is the glory of a boy

'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Well then I'm almost finally out of

I'm finally out of
Finally de de de de de de de
Well I'm almost finally, finally
Well I am free, oh I'm free

And it's okay if you had to go away
Oh just remember the telephones
Well they're working in both ways
But if I never, ever hear them ring

If nothing else I'll think the bells inside
Have finally found you someone else
And that's okay
'Cause I'll remember everything you sang

'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Well then I'm almost finally out of
I'm finally out of
Finally de de de de de de de de
Well I'm almost finally, finally
Out of words
