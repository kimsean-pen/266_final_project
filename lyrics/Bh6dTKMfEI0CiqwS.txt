Don't drink the water, yeah

Come out, come out
No use in hiding
Come now, come now
Can you not see?
There's no place here
What were you expecting?
No room for both
Just room for me
So you will lay your arms down
Yes, I will call this home

Away, away
You have been banished
Your land is gone
And given to me
And here I will spread my wings
Yes, I will call this home
What's this you say?
You feel the right to remain
Then stay, and I will bury you

What's that you say?
Your father's spirit still lives in this place
Well, I will silence you

Here's the hitch
Your horse is leaving
Don't miss your boat
It's leaving now
And as you go I will spread my wings
Yes, I will call this home
I have no time to justify to you
Fool, you're blind, move aside for me
All I can say to you, my new neighbor
Is you must move on, or I will bury you

Now, as I rest my feet by this fire
Those hands once warmed here
Well, I have retired them
I can breathe my own air
And I can sleep more soundly
Upon these poor souls
I'll build Heaven and call it home
'Cause you're all dead now
And I live with my justice
And I live with my greedy need
Or I live with no mercy
And I live with my frenzied feeding
I live with my hatred
And I live with my jealousy
Or I live with the notion
That I don't need anyone but me
Don't drink the water
Don't drink the water
There's blood in the water
Don't drink the water

Don't drink the water
Don't drink the water
There's blood in the water
Don't drink the water
There's blood in the water
