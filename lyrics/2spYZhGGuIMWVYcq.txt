The one that I loved, used to laugh when I cried.
The one that I loved, wouldn't stay by my side.
If love could've lasted forever I'd be with her today.
If love could've lasted forever I'd still hear her say darlin'
Kings of the highway we will be.

The faster you drive, the less you can feel.
The lights on the road, are strange and unreal.
When there's nothing to loose, there's nothing to win.
In a night without day, on a road without end darling,
Kings of the highway, we will be.

And your hoping the sun won't rise.
Your hoping the sun won't rise.
Kings of the highway, we will be.

The one that I loved, used to laugh when I cried.
The one that I loved, wouldn't stay by my side.
If love could've lasted forever I'd be with her today.
If love could've lasted forever I'd still hear her say darling,
Kings of the highway, we will be.
Darling kings... Of the highway... We will be.
Darling Kings... Of the highway... We will be.
We will be...
