And the tears fall like rain
Down my face again
Oh the words you wouldn't say
And the games you played
With my unfoolish heart
Oh I should have known this from the start

Oh the winter and spring
Going in hand in hand
Just like my love and pain
How the thought of you cuts deep within the vein
Brand new skin stretched across scared terrain

So I don't want to be let down
I don't want to live that life again
Don't want to be lead down the same old road
(I don't want to be let down)
So I don't want to be let down
I don't want to live my lies again
Don't want to be lead down the same old road

Ohh...

All those years down the drain
Love was not enough when you want everything
What I gave to you and now the end must start
Oh I should have listened to my heart

'Cause I don't want to be let down
I don't want to live that life again
Don't want to be lead down the same old road
(I don't want to be let down)
So I don't want to be let down
I don't want to live my lies again
Don't want to be lead down the same old road

Ohh...

'Cause I don't want to be let down
I don't want to live that life again
Don't want to be lead down the same old road
(I don't want to be let down)
So I don't want to be let down
I don't want to live my lies again
Don't want to be lead down the same old road
(I don't want to be let down)
Don't want to be lead down the same old road
(I don't want to be let down)
Don't want to be lead down the same old road
(I don't want to be let down)
Don't want to be lead down the same old road...
