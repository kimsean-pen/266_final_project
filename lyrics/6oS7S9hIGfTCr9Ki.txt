Never had to walk for love
Don't need you to show me how
Don't want to be falling in
When I'm falling out
Didn't think I'd give for love
Every time I hold back
Now there's lust in my head
I'm tryna find who I am

[Pre-Chorus]
There's choosers, there's takers
There's beggin, heartbreakers
I don't wanna be that way
You will never hear me say
Come hold me, console me
When really I'm lonely
Even if I feel this way
I don't wanna feel this way
When I...

Need someone
I don't wanna need no one
I'm not tryna let you in
Even if I find the one

Never had to wait for love
Always thought it'd come around
You come for me
But I'm nowhere to be found
Consolations with conversations
I don't need right now
I'm afraid that these relations
Aren't goin' to be tied down

There's choosers, there's takers
There's beggin, heartbreakers
I don't wanna be that way
I don't wanna feel this way
When I...

Need someone
I don't wanna need no one
I'm not tryina let you in
Even if I find the one

I don't wanna feel this way
When I...

Need someone
I don't wanna need no one
I'm not tryna let you in
Even if I find the one
