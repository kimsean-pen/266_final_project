the metronome was wrong again
my heart has surely gone and skipped a beat
now the rhythm is all right
and i can understand your point of view

jupiter this city is so bright
the kind of light that spots your eyes with white
jupiter your beauty doesn't mind
to be the center of my universe
jupiter you're seemingly so right for me

your blood is sweet like wine
and until i run out of vine
i'll keep my seat on the edge of your mind
dead in the vine of love
well, visit me in my dreams tonight

i keep my seat on the edge
