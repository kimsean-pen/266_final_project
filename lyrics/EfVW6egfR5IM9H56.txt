Me be so self-sufficient
Losing all self control
We ain't got the time that are pushing us all around
We ain't got no time to get old
Me ain't got no time, no
Me ain't got no time, no

Me be my bold ambition
Leaning towards dreams of gold
Me ain't got the time that are pushing my soul around
Me ain't got no time to get old
Me ain't got no time, no
Me ain't got no time, no
Me ain't got no time, no
Me ain't got no time, no
Me ain't got no time, no
Me ain't got no time, no

Send it up, send it out
Baby write it on the wall
Send it up, send it out
Do you really wanna know?
I just wanted you to see
I just thought that you should know
Me ain't got no time, no
Me ain't got no time, no

Me be my own suspicion
Sorry can't save my soul
Me ain't got no time
While pushing us all around
Me ain't got no time for control
Me ain't got no time, no
Me ain't got no time, no
Me ain't got no time, no
Me ain't got no time, no

Send it up, send it out
Baby write it on the wall
Send it up, send it out
Do you really wanna know?
I just wanted you to see
I just thought that you should know
Send it out to me baby
Baby let go of control

Send it up, send it out
Baby write it on the wall
Send it up, send it out
Do you really wanna know?
I just wanted you to see
I just thought that you should know
Me ain't got no time, no
Me ain't got no time, no
