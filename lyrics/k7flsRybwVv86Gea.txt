Black crane, call with all your heart
Tell 'em not to resort to religions
Black crane, black crane
Always keeping apart
Unwilling to consort with pigeons

And when things slow to a crawl
And sighs fill their eyes
Up and Away, Up, Up and Away!
And the Emperor's tastes have changed
Avert your eyes
Up and Away, Up, Up and Away!
'Cause the dreams you dreamed in the vines
Mean about as much as mine

And from the gutter
From under the rubble
Rise, rise, spread your feathers
Each word they utter
Invites more trouble
So stay beyond the reach of letters

And when things slow to a crawl
And sighs fill their eyes
Up and Away, Up, Up and Away!
And the Emperor's tastes have changed
Avert your eyes
Up and Away, Up, Up and Away!
'Cause the dreams you dreamed in the vines
Mean about as much as mine
