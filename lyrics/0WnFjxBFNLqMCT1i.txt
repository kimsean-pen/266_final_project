There is no pain Jesus can't feel
No hurt He cannot heal
For all things work according to His perfect will
No matter what you're going through

Remember God is using You
For the battle is not yours, it's the Lord's
There's no sadness Jesus can't feel
And there is no sorrow that He cannot heal
For all things work according to the Master's holy will
No matter what you're going through
Remember that God is only using You
For the battle is not yours, it's the Lord's
It's the Lord's, yes, it's the Lord's

Hold your head up high don't you cry

It's the Lord's, it's the Lord's
Yes, it's the Lord's
No matter what you're going through
Remember that God only wants to use you
For the battle is not yours, it's the Lord's
No matter what you happen to go through right now
Remember that in the midst of it all God only wants to use you
No matter what you're going through

For the battle is not yours, it's the Lord's
No matter what it is that you're going through

Hold your head up, stick your chest out
And remember He's using you
No matter what you're going through
God is only using you
For this battle is not yours alone
This battle is not yours, no
You can not handle it all by yourself
No, no, no, no, no, no
It's not yours
This battle is not yours
It's the Lord's, not yours
This battle is not yours
The Lord is the only one who can fight it
He wants to use you as His vessel
So be open to Him
It's not yours
No it's not yours
It's the Lord's, not yours
The battle is not yours
It's the Lord's
Hallelujah, yeah
