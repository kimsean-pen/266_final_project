Uh, hit 'em with a little ghetto gospel

Those who wish to follow me
(My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior without the sounds of guns

If I could recollect before my hood days
I'd sit and remanence thinkin' of bliss of the good days
I stop and stare at the younger my heart goes to 'em
They tested with stress that they under

And nowadays things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth
'Cause the truth look strange, and for me it's reversed
We left them a world that's cursed and it hurts

'Cause any day they'll push the button and all good men
Like Malcolm X and Bobby Hutton died for nothin'
Told 'em they could get teary the world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes see it clearly

There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time to hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, 'cause we're human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined
My ghetto gospel

Those who wish to follow me
(Ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior without the sounds of guns

Tell me, do you see that old lady, ain't it sad?
Livin' outta bags but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy
Guess who's givin' birth to a baby?

I don't trip and let it fade me
From outta the fryin' pan, we jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder, if they take it all back
Will I still keep the, courage?

I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, stay in control, drink out my own bottles
I made mistakes, but learn from every one
And when it's said and done
I bet this brother be a better one

If I upset you don't stress
Never forget that God isn't finished with me yet
I feel His hand on my brain
When I write rhymes, I go blind and let the Lord do His thing

But am I less holy, 'cause I chose to puff a blunt
And drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets
My ghetto gospel

Those who wish to follow me
(Yeah, ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior without the sounds of guns

Lord, can you hear me speak?
To pay the price for bein' hell bound
