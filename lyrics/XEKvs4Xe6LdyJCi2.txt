Deep inside the heart of this troubled mess
There's an itty bitty boy tuggin' hard at your hand
Born bitter as a lemon but you must understand that you are bringin' me joy
I only lie when they don't want the truth
I'm only frightened cuz you finally give me somethin' to lose
It's as loud as a thunderclap but you hear it too
But you're bringin' me joy.

Deep inside the heart of this crazy mess
I'm only calm when I get lost within your wilderness
Born crooked as a creek and come to confess that you are bringin' me joy
When I'm alive I'm livin' for you
When I'm a bluebird dyin' I'll be singin the blues
It's a heartfelt silly sort of bumbling tune but you're bringin' me joy
