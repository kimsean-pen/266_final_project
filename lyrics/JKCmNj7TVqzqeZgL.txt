Our cause so sweet and bitter
Has lost its hard blood glitter
It remains afloat on the waves
When anger fills our sails
Mutinous for the space of a second
You prayed and feared and beckoned
Now your heart is pounding away
just like mine
Should i accept this out of kindness?
Should i reject it out of shyness?
Your sleep is stabbed by dreams
Just like mine
Should i accept this out of kindness?
Should i reject it out of shyness?
Your gift so pure and sweet
Unlike mine
To thank you for what you've brought
We lure you close enough for a sword
And just for a little while
I betray you without guile
Your secret prayer scattering the smoke
Made you squeal, made us hide the rope
Now all fear, all hope is gone
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
