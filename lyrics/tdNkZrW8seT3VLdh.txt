I remiss, I admit it
I'm addicted to anything that's not good for me, mmm
And I'm spending my time thinking
Who the hell is she in your arms smiling?
I know you're afraid from what you want but I've been curious

Do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?
When you're kissing her
Touching her, staring in her eyes
Tell me, do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?
When you run your hands through her hair like you did to mine
Tell me, do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Mind, oh, oh, oh

Hypocrite, I'll admit it
'Cause it's not like I've been spending my nights alone
But I can't stop wondering if you're there at home
Wakin' up inside her
And does she feel the way I felt under you?

Do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?
When you're kissing her
Touching her, staring in her eyes
Tell me, do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?
When you run your hands through her hair like you did to mine
Tell me, do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Mind, oh, oh, oh

Oh, it's just jealousy that keeps me up at night
When you're running through my mind
I know you feel the same, tell me that I'm right
Do I ever, oh
Do I ever, ever, ever, ever

Do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?
When you're kissing her
Touching her, staring in her eyes
Tell me, do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?
When you run your hands through her hair
Like you did to mine
Tell me, do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Mind, oh, oh, oh
