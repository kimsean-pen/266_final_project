I went to a garden party
To reminisce with my old friends
A chance to share old memories
And play our songs again

When I got to the garden party
They all knew my name
No one recognized me
I didn't look the same

But it's, all right now
I learned my lesson well
You see you can't please everyone
So ya got to please yourself

People came from miles around
Everyone was there
Yoko brought her walrus
There was magic in the air

An over in the corner
Much to my surprise
Mr. Hughes hid in Dylan's shoes
Wearing his disguise

But it's, all right now
I learned my lesson well
You see ya can't please everyone
So ya got to please yourself

Lott-in-dah-dah-dah, lot-in-dah-dah-dah

Played them all the old songs
Thought that's why they came
No one heard the music
We didn't look the same

I said hello to Mary Lou
She belongs to me
When I sang a song about a honky-tonk
It was time to leave

But it's, all right now
I learned my lesson well
You see you can't please everyone
So ya got to please yourself

Lot-dah-dah-dah (lot-dah-dah-dah)
Lot-in-dah-dah-dah

Someone opened up a closet door
And out stepped Johnny B. Goode
Playing guitar like a-ringin' a bell
And lookin' like he should

If you gotta play at garden parties
I wish you a lot of luck
But if memories were all I sang
I rather drive a truck

But it's, all right now
I learned my lesson well
You see you can't please everyone
So ya got to please yourself

Lot-dah-dah-dah (lot-dah-dah-dah)
Lot-in-dah-dah-dah

And it's, all right now
Learned my lesson well
You see, ya can't please everyone
So you got to please yourself
