I can't go for that, this life without you
It's like we're living in two different worlds
But I'm holding on that some day I'll find you
I remember you, you sounded like a song

You said one life (One life)
Away from here
I said I remember the feeling
I held you near

It's all flashing right back like a video
Dancing all night to my favourite song
Can I make you mine?
1989
I hear Daryll on keys on the radio
And we're singing along to the stereo
If I kiss you right
Can I make you mine in 1989?

In 1989
In 1989
Yeah, I know we would be fine
In 1989

We used to dream this dream together
Now we're strangers in a future wide awake
Will it ever be a perfect harmony?
Will it ever sound the same for us again?

When you said one life (One life)
Away from here
I said I remember the feeling
I held you near

It's all flashing right back like a video
Dancing all night to my favourite song
Can I make you mine?
1989
I hear Daryll on keys on the radio
And we're singing along to the stereo
If I kiss you right
Can I make you mine in 1989?

In 1989
In 1989
I know we would be fine
In 1989

You said one life (One life)
Away from here
I said I remember the feeling
I held you near

(It's all flashing right back like a video)
(Dancing all night to my favourite song)
(Can I make you mine?)
(1989)

It's all flashing right back like a video
Dancing all night to my favourite song
Can I make you mine? (Can I make you mine?)
1989 (In 1989)
I hear Daryll on keys on the radio
And we're singing along to the stereo
If I kiss you right
Can I make you mine in 1989?

In 1989
In 1989
I know we would be fine
In 1989
