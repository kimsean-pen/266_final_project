Big on the night
I'm totally big on the night
It's a complex destination
Because it ends in resurrection
I'm so sorry that there's nothing there, but it's sung in the light
Two time winners would've been alone
Gonna cry
Every day

Dudes who rain on innocence
It's around time time fools done pay their respects
And your heart, never brighter than light

And it's gonna gotta turn into a baby
And it's gonna gotta why? because to save me
In a tunnel of love

I had the play
Peace with me

I would attest
Peace with me
I would attack
Peace with me

Big on the night
I only go with the night
To daunt the play's donation
And await the resurrection
It's so silly that there's nothing there, but it's sung in the light
Two time winners would've been alone
Gonna cry
Every day

Two times there and no recess
It's around time time school time play on this mess
And your heart, in the manner of now
