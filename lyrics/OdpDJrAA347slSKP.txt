I am but a farce, a satire of stability
Insecurity is an uphill struggle, it's me versus the world
The shore still starves
For another

Novel of my shipwrecked being tied up dried alive still breathing
The sands of time from me are running out

My hands shake in apprehension
Of every action I'm guilty of playing the victim
The shore still starves
For another

Novel of my shipwrecked being tied up dried alive still breathing
The sands of time for me are running out

Just like the embrace of arms that made you
They'll surely destroy you
Just like the embrace of arms that made you
They'll surely destroy you

It's time for your panic
Then it kills and makes you manic

Making its way inside - relax, it's alright
Making its way inside - relax, it's alright
Panic grips your frantic breathing
I can't breathe, I can't breathe, I cant breathe!

Just like the embrace of arms that made you
They'll surely destroy you
Just like the embrace of arms that made you
They'll surely destroy you
Just like the embrace of arms that made you
They'll surely destroy you
Just like the embrace of arms that made you
They'll surely destroy you
Just like the embrace of arms that made you
They'll surely destroy you
