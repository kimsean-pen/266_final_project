It was the start of my sophomore year, I had
My broken heart, you were my biggest fear
And then you watched me run out
Of all the right things to say
Still finding reasons to stay with you

Gave you a call, because I needed a ride
I never thought I'd be with you in your passenger side and now
We're drivin downtown
Baby you make me feel young like I just turned 21, yeah

I don't mind if you stay by my side and never let go, oh
I don't mind if you stay all the time, i'll never let go, oh

Light up while we're up in my room, I'm laughin'
Your feet are too small when you try on my shoes, and then
Massage my face now
Well I can tell you're not done, and I would usually run, but

I don't mind if you stay by my side and never let go, oh
I don't mind if you stay all the time, i'll never let go, oh
