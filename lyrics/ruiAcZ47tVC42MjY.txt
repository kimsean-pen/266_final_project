It's 6 a.m. and I'm wide awake
Cause I can't stop thinking 'bout the stuff you were saying
To me and I, I can't let it slide
The paper's not here yet, the sun's not up
But I'm not afraid to tell you what I feel inside
I had one of those dreams that make it all so

Clear to me now
I got a whole new perspective
It's so clear to me now
You can't treat me that way
It appears to me how long
You tried to make me think
It was me who was being the fake
So clear

Why did I smile, when I hurt inside?
Said I was okay, when I knew it's a lie
I wanted to believe in you
You took your chances and one was me
So I'll just forgive you and set you free
Yeah, I'm on my way
Yeah, I'm stepping out of the haze, and it's so

Clear to me now
I got a whole new perspective
It's so clear to me now
You can't treat me that way
It appears to me how long
You tried to make me think
It was me who was being the fake
So clear

I wanna put the past behind
Try and maybe I can find better days
First time in a while
Think I even feel a smile on my face

I got a whole new perspective
Yeah, I do...
You can't treat me that way, it's so

Clear to me now
I got a whole new perspective
It's so clear to me now
You can't treat me that way
It appears to me how long
You tried to make me think
It was me who was being the fake
So clear

Yeah, so clear, so clear
So clear

The sun's going down on a Saturday
And I feel alright, I feel okay
