Once is too much for me
A thousand is never enough
Once is too much for me
A thousand is never enough
Once is too much for me
A thousand is never enough
Once is too much for me
A thousand is never enough
It's never enough

The bees are coming for ya
Coming for ya

It's never enough

Just enough, just enough

We're coming for ya
The bees coming for ya, coming for ya

Now our parents are all dead
The firstborns in their beds
The bees are coming to
Other flowers in your head

And California how your mourn!
With the sickness in your corn
The cold firstborn and
The other flowers in my head

Stick your head into your feet
Stick your feet down in your head
Stick your head into my feet into my blood
