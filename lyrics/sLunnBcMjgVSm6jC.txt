We look thinner in this picture, so full of life.

Dreams we shared seemed richer, and gave meaning to everything.
A shift in time, we now rely on bad TV and no talking.
This needs to end.

Leave town when words have gone astray and flat, escaped your mouth in ways.
Standing under rain clouds is all we do these days.
Your words have gone astray and flat, escape this town and place,
your hand in mine for rainclouds are not that bad in ways.
