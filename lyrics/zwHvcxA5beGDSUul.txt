My friend told me of a secret
Told me that she blames herself
You invaded her magnificence
Put your hand over her mouth

Why was she all alone
Wearing her shirt that low
They said, "Boys will be boys"
Deaf to the word no

Your father told you that you're innocent
Told ya women rape themselves
Would you blame your little sister
If she cried to you for help

Why was she all alone
Wearing her shirt that low
They said, "Boys will be boys"
Deaf to, deaf to
Deaf to the word
No, no, no, no

Like a mower in the morning
I will never let you rest
You broke all the bonds she gave you
Time to pay the fucking rent
