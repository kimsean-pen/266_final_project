Folks, we finally got our headline.
"Newsies Crushed as Bulls Attack"
Crutchie's calling me,
Dumb crip's just too damn slow.
Guys are fightin', bleedin' fallin'
Captain Jack just wants to close his eyes and go.
Let me go.
Far away.
Somewhere they won't ever find me,
and tomorrow won't remind me of today.
And the city's finally sleepin'.
And the moon looks old and grey.
I get on a train thats bound for Santa Fe.
And I'm gone.
And I'm done.
No more running. No more lying.
No more fat old man denying me my pay.
Just a moon so big and yellow, it turns night right into day.
Dreams come true. Yeah they do. In Santa Fe.
Where does it say you gotta live and die here?
Where does it say a guy can't catch a break?
Why should you only take what you're given?
Why should you spend your whole life
living trapped where there ain't no future.
Even at 17. Breaking your back for someone else's sake.
If the life don't seem to suit you, how about a change of scene?
Far from the lousy headlines and the deadlines in between.
Santa Fe, my old friend.
I can't spend my whole life dreaming.
Though I know thats all I seem inclined to do.
I ain't getting any younger.
And I wanna start brand new.
I need space. And fresh air.
Let them laugh in my face. I don't care.
Save my place. I'll be there.

Just be real is all I'm asking.
Not some painting in my head.
'Cause I'm dead if I can't count on you today.
I got nothing if I ain't got Santa Fe.
