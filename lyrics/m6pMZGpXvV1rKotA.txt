Go!

I know you can feel it
Let it in
People will still hate you in the end
So hate back, plan the attack
Then they'll realize they can't crack
The mind of a fucking maniac

The voice inside you always wins
Your grave's been dug so lie in it
And commit until the end
For your dear old friend
And I promise that amends will
meet at the end

Why can't I be anything without you?
Because the scars will fade
and you'll never age
When you give your life
to the mark of the blade
The cold grasp of the past still haunts me
I will erase everything
If you give your life to the mark of the blade

You can come with me
or you can stay and grow old
and let the universe swallow your rotting soul
Turn a blind eye to everything
or take a chance to be blind
To model ignorance

The voice inside you never quits
It'll haunt you until your dying breath
So breath in, and breathe out
Reach deep within
And I promise that amends will meet at the end

Why can't I be anything without you?
Because the scars will fade and you'll never age
When you give your life to the mark of the blade
The cold grasp of the past still haunts me
I will erase everything
If you give your life to the mark of the blade

Give your life to the mark of the blade
(Give your life)
It'll take your name beyond the grave
Give your life to the mark of the blade
(Give your life)
Give your life to the mark of the blade

I bleed the blood
that is cut from the blade
I bear the mark and I won't be a slave
Come with me and be saved

Why can't I be anything without you?
Because the scars will fade and you'll never age
When you give your life to the mark of the blade
The cold grasp of the past still haunts me
I will erase everything
If you give your life to the mark of the blade
