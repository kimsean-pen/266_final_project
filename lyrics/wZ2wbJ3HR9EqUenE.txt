Daydreamer,
Walking through the clouds its a screamer
And falling from the sky is lots of streamers
It's time to grow up and be a leader, leader, leader

Where do we go, where do we go from here
Where do we go, where do we go from here

Cause I've been on my knees again
Calling out calling out, calling out
Cause I've been on my knees again
Calling out calling out, calling out

Cause I'm only a man
And I think I need some time to breathe
But I've done all I can
And I'm hoping one day they'll see

Cause I've been on my knees again
Well I've been on my knees
Well I've been on my knees again
Well I've been on my knees

Daydreamer,
Walking through the clouds its a screamer
And falling from the sky is lots of streamers
It's time to grow up and be a leader, leader, leader

Where do we go, where do we go from here
Where do we go, where do we go from here

Cause I've been on my knees again
Calling out calling out, calling out
Cause I've been on my knees again
Calling out calling out, calling out

Cause I've been on my knees again
Well I've been on my knees
Well I've been on my knees again
Well I've been on my knees
Well I've been on my knees again
Well I've been on my knees
Well I've been on my knees again
Well I've been on my knees
Well I've been on my knees again
Well I've been on my knees
