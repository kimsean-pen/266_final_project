you're falling further down but i've got you by a thread
i wrap the chord around my arms until my hands start to turn red
but it's not enough, it won't be enough to save you

she's so in love with all the things i hate most about myself
i'm so in love with all the sounds she makes when she smiles and well
it's a little tough, to put acorn shells on ice sheets
without breaking through, and flooding the whole town

i hope you're alright
i didn't wanna wake up last night
cause i quite liked the dream i had of holding your hand
it's funny how slowly time goes when my
thoughts have been racing all this time

it's alright to feel a little bit of darkness now and then
i know i've said it once but i still tell myself again and again
you'll never be enough, but what is enough, you're selfless
isn't that enough

banana bread before i go to bed will put the bees to sleep
otherwise they'd buzz and sting my lungs all night inside of me
just wait a little while, u don't cry too much
u know that when u smile, the sun shines more gently
