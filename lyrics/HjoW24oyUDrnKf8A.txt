COME ON!

I am the innocent
I am what could have been
The dreams you talk about
Now left on broken skin
Here lies hysteria
A land where chaos reigns
Global Disturbia
Bows down to twisted ways.

A world of hate awaits
We are The Wild Ones
They all look the same...
Our time has come

I am the chosen
Wretched and Divine
I am the unspoken
The one they left behind
Fearless, fight until we die
I am broken
The Wretched and Divine

I am the Devil's smile
The one caught everyday
A hopeful hero's speech
Won't stop the years you bleed
I am a hurricane
And Army strong as one
As they sit back and laugh
The one you left has just begun

A world of hate awaits
We are The Wild Ones
They all look the same...
Our time has come

I am the chosen
Wretched and Divine
I am the unspoken
The one they left behind
Fearless, fight until we die
I am broken
The Wretched and Divine

We live for broken hearts
Won't watch them fall apart
We live for the ones
Who don't know they exist
We die for endless winter
Beginner and the sinner
We die for the ones
Who raise their hands to resist

I am the chosen
Wretched and Divine
I am the unspoken
The one they left behind
Fearless, fight until we die
I am broken
The Wretched and Divine
The Wretched and Divine
The Wretched and Divine
