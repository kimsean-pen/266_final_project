Tattoo'd Lady
Bearded baby
They're my family
When I was lonely
Something told me where I could always be

Where I could
Wish for pennies
If we had any
You'd meet me down
At the shooting gallery

Yes I'm a fair ground baby.
Wonder what made me
Fall for the pearly queen

I spent my youth
Under canvas roof
As I roamed from town to town
I'm not fooling
When I say I got no schoolin'
Never like the class bell sound

From the caravan
I hear the fairground band
Sounding good as they can be
You know I can't be found
But if you look around
Tomorrow we'll be gone by dawn
Alright

Now hear it on the loud speaker say
The fire eater is a real fine sight to see
Yeah he's a death cheater
Some kind of central heater
Be sure to save a seat for me

Let me tell you 'bout wicked Sadie
She's no baby
The law came
And tried to close her sideshow down
But soon she had the D.A. cheering
The police chief wearing
Her garter for a crown

I spent my youth
Under canvas roof
As I roamed from town to town
I'm not fooling
When I say I got no schoolin'
Never like the school bell sound

From the caravan
I hear the fairground band
Sounding good as they can be

You know I can't be found
But if you look around
Tomorrow we'll be gone by dawn
Yeahh
