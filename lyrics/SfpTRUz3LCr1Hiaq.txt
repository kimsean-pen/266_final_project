It's a heartwarming song
For the easily moved
The effect is all wrong
Plain to see I'm not moved

As I stand in the light
Of a shop that is closed
God, I'd love me a fight
There's no poem just prose

Edith Piaf said it better than me
"Je ne regrette rien"
Pretty song, but not intended for me
Time to put some muzak on

There were no smoky dives
Few amours, fous or not
There were no petty crimes
Foreign substances bought

There were no midnight drives
With a crime boss's wife
Need a sentence at most
In assessing my life

Edith Piaf said it better than me
"Je ne regrette rien"
Pretty song, but not intended for me
Time to put some muzak on

Drunken and short-lived flings
Montparnasse lights
Holding a hand of kings
My hunch was right
When's that night?

Edith Piaf said it better than me
"Je ne regrette rien"
Pretty song, but not intended for me
Time to put some muzak on

Live fast and die young
Live fast and die young
Live fast and die young
Too late for that
Too late for that

Live fast and die young
Live fast and die young
Live fast and die young
Too late for that
Too late for that

Live fast and die young
Live fast and die young
Live fast and die young
Too late for that
Too late for that

Live fast and die young
Live fast and die young
Live fast and die young
Too late for that
Too late for that

Think of one single night
One so strong, you're aflame
Well, I'm sorry, time's up
Sorry, nothing will change

Edith Piaf said it better than me
"Je ne regrette rien"
Pretty song, but not intended for me
Time to put some muzak on
Edith Piaf said it better

Born to be bad
I was born to be bad
I was born to be bad
Not this time, not this time

Born to be bad
I was born to be bad
I was born to be bad
Not this time, not this time

Edith Piaf said it better than me
"Je ne regrette rien"
Pretty song, but not intended for me
Listen, there is muzak on
Edith Piaf said it better
