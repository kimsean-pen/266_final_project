Step by aching stepson
And you'll fall into the blue
And you'll fall into the blue
Oh, I'm coming down for you

Step by aching stepson
And I'll lead you by the hand
And we'll fall into the blue
Oh, I'm coming down for you
Oh, I'm coming down for you

But I'm falling deeper now I go
And I'm falling down the grounds beneath the road
And I'm falling deeper down I go
And I'm falling deeper now I know

And I'm falling deeper down the shore
And I'm falling as the rocks way down below
As the rocks way down below
As the rocks way down below

Step by aching stepson
And you'll fall into the blue
And you'll fall into the blue
Oh, I'm coming down for you

Step by aching stepson
And I'll lead you by the hand
And we'll fall into the blue
Oh, I'm coming down for you

Oh, I'm coming down for you
Coming down for you
Coming down for you
Coming down for you
Coming down for you
Coming down for you
