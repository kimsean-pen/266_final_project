Rita, get yourself together
Monday never comes
Rita, this is now or never
Sunday I'll be gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone...

All your secrets
No longer mine
And we drift away
All the good days
You left behind
Can we press rewind

Whisper out my fears
Let me dry your tears
Now I'm just a ghost, my love

Rita, get yourself together
Monday never comes
Rita, this is now or never
Sunday I'll be gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone...
