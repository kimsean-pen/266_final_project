Fade to cold, beyond false arch
Colourfull pictures taken of a dead mind
Lifeless boatman in the shore of lake
The tide will bring you
The fullmoon removed now
A mute riot with a horrific smell
Extencive perpetuation
Succeed the simple thought
Manifest of a new reality
Morallity of a dark age
Special voice
Rise above

Ashes & Bones
The law decide
Transmit my word
Divided society, man against man
Dogmatic philosophy, instincts of age
Vibration skinning the map
Like a satelite i watch all your moves
Quarter fo a year
Is enough
The triangle cover all angles
Just touch the ground & See your hands
Two thousand years after christ
- Dark Age -
