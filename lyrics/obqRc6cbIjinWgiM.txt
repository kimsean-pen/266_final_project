Rage in us
Your thirst I'm taking
Pull the plug I'll keep on shaking
And thrustin' about your apartment
Drowned on the blankets floral and fading
Painful lust, two aching guts
They tear through each other in the mirror
This happy vacation, there's no motivation
So hold me up

You say you want to chase the moon like fire
Well, together we can fake our own death here
Just wanna be alone and watch as you all just disappear

D-d-d-darker now
Kicked out and sleeping in your car
You roll the window down enough to dream and make-believe
Our lights knocked out, turned upside down
And I'm just a stupid motherfucker
Can't figure it out
I want devil horns
I wanna breathe in your rush
I wanna leap when you want me to fly
But darlin' I don't mean to beg
But these thorns on the stem are nearly tearing up my skin

And now you wanna chase the moon like fire
Well, together we can fake our own death here
Just wanna be alone and watch as you all just disappear

Tony!

Close your eyes
Picture you and I
Selling daylight for gasoline

So now we're gonna chase the moon like fire
Yeah, together we can fake our own death here
Just wanna be alone and watch as you all just disappear

Just wanna be alone and watch
Why can't we be alone and watch?
