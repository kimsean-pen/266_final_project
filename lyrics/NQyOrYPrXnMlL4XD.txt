This is the end of us
You'll never hear my voice again
You are ridiculous
With your imaginary friends

All that I want
Is for you to come to ruin
All that I want
Is for you to come to ruin
All that I want
Is for you to come crawling back

This is the end of us
And everything you said we'd be
And all the love I bring
I will be taking home with me

I do not want
For you to be happy
I do not want
For you to be happy
All that I want
Is for you to come crawling back

I want you to come to me
I want you to come to me
I want you to come to me
I want you to, I want you to...

This is the first day
Of many years of sorrow
You won't forget my name
But I'll forget your face tomorrow

All that I want
Is for you to come to ruin
All that I want
Is for you to come to ruin
All that I want
Is for you to come crawling back to me
Is for you to come crawling back to me
Is for you to come craling back...
Is for you to come crawling back to me
