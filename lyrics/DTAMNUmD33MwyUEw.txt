About as subtle as an earthquake, I know
My mistakes were made for you
And in the back room of a bad dream she came
And whisked me away, enthused

And it's as solid as a rock rolling down a hill
The fact is that it probably will hit something
On the hazardous terrain

And we're just following the flock
'Round and in between, before we're smashed to smithereens
Like they were
And we scramble from the blame

And it's the fame that put words in her mouth
She couldn't help but spit 'em out
Innocence and arrogance entwined
In the filthiest of minds

She was bitten on her birthday and now
A face in the crowd she's not
And I suspect that now forever the shape
She came to escape is forgot

And it's a lot to ask her not to sting
And give her less than everything
Around your crooked conscience she will wind

'Cause we're just following the flock
'Round and in between, before we're smashed to smithereens
Like they were
And we scramble from the blame

And it's the fame that put words in her mouth
She couldn't help but spit 'em out
Around your crooked conscience she will wind

And it's a lot to ask her not to sting
And give her less than everything
Innocence and arrogance entwined
