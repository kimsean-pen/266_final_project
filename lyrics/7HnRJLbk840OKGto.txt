Oh, if you love the life you live, then you'll get a lot more done
Be more inclined to take the reins and turn away and run
It's very rare, it seems to get a lifetime guarantee
So I suppose self satisfaction be the key

Oh, my father is a wealthy, self made man
But his wealth does not consist of riches or acres of land
And instead he has a family who are his biggest fans
That's something that I one day hope to have

So I'll cherish the simple things
The easy 'Took for granted' things
Like going round my mum's house for my tea
And argue with my sister, only God knows how I missed her
It's the simple things that mean the most to me

Ah, he gets up each day at five
And starts the car and makes the drive
And shutters up and starts the fryers
Serves out food to all the buyers in the town

As they stand there in the same old line
And get there every day at the same old time
No, you never hear him grumble and groan
'Cause they're the people in the line that he built it on

And like me he cherished the simple things
The easy 'Took for granted' things
Like going round his mum's house for my tea
And argue with his sister, only God knows how he missed her
It's the simple things that mean the most to him
