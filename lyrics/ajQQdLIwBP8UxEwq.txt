Threw away your greatest hits
You left them here the day you split
Your bass guitar and shag CD
Well, they don't mean that much to me
Right now I'm going through your things
These days, I'm changing all my strings

I'm gonna write you a letter
I'm gonna write you a book
I want to see your reaction
I want to see how it looks
From way up on your cloud
Where you've been hiding out
Are you getting somewhere?
Or did you get lost in Amsterdam?

You won't get too far from me
Believing everything you read
You're wasted in the great unknown
And I am finally ready to dispose
Of all your vintage clothes
Your drugs and every secret code

I'm gonna write you a letter
I'm gonna write you a book
I want to see your reaction
I want to see how it looks
From way up on your cloud
Where you've been hiding out
Are you getting somewhere?
Or did you get lost in Amsterdam?

From your red balloon, you were
A super high tech jet fighter
Floating over Planet Earth
Come back down here, I'll show you where it hurts
Take this bitter pill
Is it easy to swallow?

I'm gonna write you a letter
I'm gonna write you a book
I want to see your reaction
I want to see how it looks
From way up on your cloud
Where you've been hiding out
Are you getting somewhere?
Or did you get lost in Amsterdam, Amsterdam?
