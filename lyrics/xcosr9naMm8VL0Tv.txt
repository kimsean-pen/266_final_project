AHHRRRRHHHH!
you only got one finger left,
and it's pointing at the door,
and your taking for granted,
what the lords laid on the floor,
so i'm picking up the pieces
and i'm puttin' them up for sale,
throw your meal ticket out the window,
put your skeletons in jail
cause lord only knows it's gettin' late
the senses are gone, so don't you hesistate,
give yourself a call,
letcha' bottom dollars fall
throwin your two-bit cares down the drain.
invite me to the seven seas,
like some seasick man.
you'll do whatever you please,
and i'll do whatever i can.
titanic, fare thee well,
my eyes are turning pink
don't call us when the new age,
gets old enough to drink,
cause lord only knows it's getting late,
your senses are gone so don't you hesitate,
move on up the hill,
theres nothing dead, left to kill,
throwin' your two bit cares down the drain...
yeah...

Goin' back to houston,
to the hot dog dance,(fading)
Goin' back to houston,
to get me some pants...(quiet)
