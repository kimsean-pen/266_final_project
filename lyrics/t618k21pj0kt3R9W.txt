Oohh ohh

Im stoned
Im stoned at your love

Baby
When I found out you were lying

Playing around aint nothing
Undesired ****? I was crying
Sugar coated lies I was buying

I was just a back seat driver
In a cold love
Going where you take me
Don't know why
I put up with the pain

Nobody else can make me
Got me out of my mind
Stoned â€“ out of my mind
You've got me going
Out of my mind
You've got me going
Out of my mind
You've got me going
Out of my mind

You lead me to the point that I drank

Then I dreamed more than I could take
When you took
My mind and my body
I know you wanna take my soul

Where can I run

Where can I hide

Tell me
Who can I turn to

Tell me
What can I do

You got me going
Out of my mind
You got me going
Out of my mind
You got me going
Out of my mind
You got me going

Out of my head
Out of my mind
Out of my head
Out of my mind
Im going crazy

Out of my head
Out of my mind
Out of my head
Out of my mind
Im going crazy

Stoned
out of my mind

Stoned

Out of my head
Out of my mind
Out of my head
Out of my mind
Im going crazy

Stoned
out of my mind

Stoned

Im going crazy

Stoned
out of my mind

Stoned
