She closed the door
She hides behind the face nobody knows
She feels her skin touch the floor
She wants to fight
Her eyes are tired, nobody's on her side
She wants to feel like she did before

She looks into her mirror, wishing someone could hear her, so loud

And I need love
To hold me closer in the night, just enough

I need love
To hold me closer in the night, just enough
To feel my body come alive
When my bone start breaking, my heart start shaking
I need need love

The coffee's cold
He turned around and said, "I hope you know
You're beautiful, have you ever been told?"
She's a little shy
As he walks away, she slowly breaks a smile
The skies are blue, haven't been for a while

She looks into her mirror, wishing someone could hear her, so loud

I need love
To hold me closer in the night, just enough
To feel my body come alive
When my bone start breaking, my heart start shaking
I need love, need love

She closed door
She hides behind the face nobody knows
She feels her skin touch the floor

I need love
To hold me closer in the night, just enough
To feel my body come alive
When my bone start breaking, my heart start shaking
I need love, need love
