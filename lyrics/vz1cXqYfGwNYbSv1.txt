refrain: (2x)
Say goodbye, say goodbye to loneliness
Hand in hand we walk away
Nothing matters when we kiss our tears away

I remember that day you left without a trace
I was so afraid to give my heart away
Now I've lost it

refrain2:
Why should I, should I come back
(and throw it all away)
Why should I, should I come back

refrain (2x)

(Say goodbye)

Now I know that you're the one for me
Please give me another chance
I'm no longer afraid to give my heart away
Baby, come back and stay

refrain2

(Say goodbye)

Say goodbye, say goodbye,
Say goodbye to your loneliness, my love
Hand in hand,
Hand in hand we walk away together now

refrain (4x)

Say goodbye
