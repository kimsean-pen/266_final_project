We got have peace
To keep the world alive
And war to cease.

We got to have joy,
True in our hearts
With strength we can't destroy.

People please hear us (people please hear us)
Through our voice the world knows
There's no choice.

We're begging save the children
The little ones
Who just don't understand

Give them a chance
To breed their young
And help purify the land

People please hear us (people please hear us)
Through our voice the world knows
There's no choice.

And the people in the neighbourhood,
Who would if they only could,
Meet and shake the other's hand,
Work together for the good of the land.

Give us all an equal chance,
It could be such a sweet romance.
And the soldiers who are dead and gone,
If only we could bring back one,

He'd say "We've got to have peace"
To keep the world alive
And war to cease

We got to have joy
Ture in our hearts
With strength we can't destroy

People please hear us (people please hear us)
Through our voice the world knows
There's no choice

And the people in the neighbourhood
Who would if they only could
Meet and shake the other's hand
Work together for the good of the land

Give us all an equal chance
It could be such a sweet romance
And the soldiers who are dead and gone
If only we could bring back one

He'd say "We've got to have peace"
Aah - hah, we got to have peace. Let Let the world know it

Peace, peace, peace
Aah - hah, we got to have peace

People please hear us (people please hear us)
Through our voice the world knows
There's no choice

Save the children

Save the children

Save the children

And the people in the neighbourhood
Who would if they only could
Meet and shake the other's hand
Work together for the good of the land

Give us all an equal chance
It could be such a sweet romance
And the soldiers who are dead and gone
If only we could bring back one

He'd say "We've got to have peace"
Lo - rd, we got to have peace

Let the people say it

Peace peace peace
Aah - hah, we got to have peace
