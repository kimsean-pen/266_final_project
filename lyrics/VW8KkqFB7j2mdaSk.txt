oooh ooooooh
oooh ooooooh
oooh ooooooh
oooh ooooooh

we were lovers
we were kissers
we were holders of hands
we were make believers
just losing time

and you said you'd rather live in tv land
than say that you care
but you don't
that's heartless and i will not cry

but i'm still in love
and i'm still in love
and i'm still in love
and i'm still in love

your dreams of acting onscreen
what do they mean
you'll be dancing senseless in your bedroom

and you find yourself out of a job
and before too long
you'll be selling lemonade to the overpaid

and i'm still in love
and i'm still in love
and i'm still in love
and i'm still in
love

oooh ooooooh
oooh ooooooh
oooh ooooooh
oooh ooooooh

i remember
it was summer
i was out of my head
but you weren't you're selfish
and a waste of space

but i'm still in love
and i'm still in love
and i'm still in love
and i'm still in love
i'm still in love
and i'm still in love
and i'm still in
love
