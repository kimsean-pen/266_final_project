Despise your lack of Loyalty
Despise your lack of Love
Find it unbelievable
Betray My sense of Blood
Yearn for blind obedience
A Sign from Above
A Golden Opportunity
For Madness in The Voice of God

Like Honey in The Sun
It falls off the knife – Completion!
Blue eyed Honey in The Sun
Warm, wet and on
The Run.

A quiet Dark Moon week
Forever Loves Decay
Field of painted birds
Scarecrow all Death away
We'll push on regardless
Through cold witch-hunt lines
Punk drunk with Existence
Punch drunk with Our Time.

Like Honey in The Sun
It falls off the knife – Completion!
Blue eyed Honey in The Sun
Warm, wet and on the run
On The Run, on the run, on the run, on the run,...
On The Run, on the run, on the run, on the run?
Despise your lack of Loyalty
Despise your lack of Love
Find it unbelievable
Betray My sense of Blood
A quiet Dark Moon week
Forever Loves Decay
Field of painted birds
Scarecrow all Death away

Like Honey In The Sun
It falls off the knife – Completion!
Blue eyed Honey in The Sun
Warm, wet and on the run
On The Run, on the run, on the run, on the run,...
On The Run, on the run

Like Honey in The Sun,...
Like Honey in The Sun,
Like Honey in The Sun,...
Like Honey in The Sun...
