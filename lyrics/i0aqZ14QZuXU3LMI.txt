Tried to bend your kneecaps and they shattered
Tried to move your legs but they bolted your joints together
And the more you tried, the more you knew
This had been the way they'd built you
In the body of a ball jointed doll
You're so fragile you can't move at all

But I just want to touch you and I promise I won't break you
If you would be my doll just for a day
Then I would put you back into, back into your case

Pieced your limbs together with chalk-ware skin
Painted the cupid's bow above your lips
You're so beautiful but so delicate
The porcelain cracks up your back and neck
In the body of a ball jointed doll
You're so fragile you can't move at all

But I just want to touch you and I promise I won't break you
If you would be my doll just for a day
Then I would put you back into, back into your case
