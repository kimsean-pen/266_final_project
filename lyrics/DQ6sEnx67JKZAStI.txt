Met you on a Friday mystified
Heard you found the world
but where's the prize for me?
For me
Underneath the stars yeah on the map
Keep it in the dark
the way you like to see
To see
Cause I've only ever seen the light
The space that lies between your eyes
and me
And me

We're not dressed to belong
We're not meant to move on
You can't take me along
But I know that you wanna
I played safe for too long
I'm not meant to move on
I wanna feel you all wrong
Until it feels like trouble

It feels like trouble

You held me like the dust
beneath the blinds
Staring at the sun no peace of mind
for me
I spoke until you laughed
and you let me try
To pull a little closer to you
right behind the screen
With me
You don't even know
the things you hide
Behind the lights
Inside your eyes
Are the keys that you can't see

We're not dressed to belong
We're not meant to move on
You can't take me along
But I know that you wanna
I played safe for too long
I'm not meant to move on
I wanna feel you all wrong

Until it feels like trouble
It feels like trouble
Feels like trouble

We're not dressed to belong
We're not meant to move on
You can't take me along
But I know that you wanna
I played safe for too long
I'm not meant to move on
I wanna feel you all wrong
Until it feels like trouble
It feels like trouble
Feels like trouble
