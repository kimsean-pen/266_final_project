Chopping lines in international sand
Feeding blood junkie habits of the elephant man
Quench his thirst with black water rising
Executive outcomes on a burning horizon

Yeah motherfucker, let's take a ride
We're rolling Route Irish, someone has got to die
Trick or treat, it's IEDs
So roll the dice as we leave
'Cause it's eight miles of pure luck with more bang for Sam's buck
Guaran-fucking-teed
Someone will bleed
Guaran-fucking-teed
Someone will bleed

Privatize to conceal all the lies
Big business is booming like it's the Fourth of July
No need for all the formalities
Jump the kangaroo courts
And plant the lynching trees

Yeah motherfucker, let's take a ride
Running red lights in a green zone, someone has got to die
Hidden aegis, nothing here to see
So load the dice for me please
And let's snort the bottom line, crude cashed into refined
Guaran-fucking-teed
Just sign the deed
Guaran-fucking-teed
Someone will bleed

Someone has got to die
Ours is not to reason why
Ours is but to do if the pay rate's right
Black liquid assets, fuck the mujahideen
Paint their picket fences red with the American dream
Lay the hammer hammer down, get the job done right
Jacked up and clocked in into a fire fight
Covert reactions and you never saw me
A glass parking lot in the American dream

They all die
Fucking murder

Guaran-fucking-teed
Someone will bleed
Guaran-fucking-teed
Lay the hammer hammer down, get the job done right
Jacked up and clocked in into a fire fight
Covert reactions and you never saw me
A glass parking lot in the American dream
