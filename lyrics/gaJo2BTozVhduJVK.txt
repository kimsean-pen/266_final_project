I never dreamed that there'd come a day
When I'd find myself far from your arms
Now that I am, I can hardly stand
Not to be near your sweet Southern charms

Send me a peach from old Georgia
Down where the Savannah flows
If I could have one bite of Georgia
I would feel right here at home

I miss the shady old lanes there
Walking with you by my side
Just send me one peach from Georgia
Just so I know you'll be mine

I hope that you won't forget me
Before my road leads back to you
Though the winter may bring
The whole world to it's knees
The Spring shall return with its fruit

The wind here is ready for winter
It seems to turn everything blue
So just (send me) send me one little peach
Just a sweet sunny piece of you
