Let's go

You think we're different?
You think we never feel the way you do?
We've got scars to prove we're too
Nothing but human
Fueled by emotions that we thought we knew
But really had no clue

PRESSURE
It's not the end of the world
Think where you started from
To where you're standing now
FAILURE
It's not the end of the world
The best of us rise from the fall

This is the end, this is the end
You're not alone in this, my friend
This is the end, this is the end

Soak in your weakness
See if those colors feel right for you
The best of black and blue
Embrace the darkness
The light is there so don't give in to fear
You'll make it through

PRESSURE
It's not the end of the world
Think where you started from
To where you're standing now
FAILURE
It's not the end of the world
The best always rise from the fall

This is the end, this is the end
You're not alone in this, my friend
This is the end, this is the end
This is the end, this is the end
You're not alone in this, my friend
This is the end, this is the end

Feed the fire, just feed the fire in you
(Feed the fire, feed the fire)
Feed the fire, just feed the fire in you
(Feed the fire, feed the fire)
Feed the fire, feed the fire
Burn away the fear
Let your heart take over
Feed the fire, feed the fire
Burn away the fear
Let your heart take over now

This is the end, this is the end
You're not alone in this, my friend
This is the end, this is the end
This is the end
This is the end, this is the end
You're not alone in this, my friend
This is the end, this is the end
This is the end
