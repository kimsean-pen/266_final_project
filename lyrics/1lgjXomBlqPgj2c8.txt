Welcome to the underworld
Where the love's oversized
The kind that we like
Under, under, under, underworld
Roll in this feeling, it's herb related
Let your eyes be your mind elated
This is a room whre your ego can't fake it
So go ahead, let your hair fall down
Through the world's over-populated
You can feel free it's love we're making
You'd be a fool to refuse to take it
So, don't be shy, come inside
Welcome to the underworld
Where the love's oversized
The kind that we like
Under, under, under, underworld
Welcome to the underworld
Where the people stay high
All of their lives
Underworld
It's a beauteous understatement
Like the sun shining through the rain's hands
Sounds never complicated
Just don't think too tough that's enough (Just feel)

Listen to the echo of a sound that saves me
Walk the shortest of miles to crazy
Let the note that you wrote
Lay me down
Sow your seeds good now
A stitch that allows us to move
Inside and out all around each other's groove
Underworld
Where the love's oversized
The kind that we like
Under, under, under, underworld
Welcome to the underworld
Where the people stay high
All of their lives
Underworld
I wanna see what you want
when you feel free
I can't imagine it would be much more
than a turn of a table
So you can be able to feel
the heat of the heavy beat
Let go, Let go
Leave those cuff links the street
it's an itch you got to scratch
Yes, burn your mail, mail
Bishaboshabash, no kinda word
can tell your tale
No height you got to match
You can stay or you can bail
I throw a light I hope you can catch, hope you catch
We'll dim the bright so you relax, you relax
I wanna see what you look like
when you leave, who will you be
Will you feel lovely
As you smoke the breeze bought to you by the trees
Mother nature's leaves
Welcome to the underworld
Where the love's oversized
The kind that we like
Under, under, under, underworld
Welcome to the underworld
Where the people stay high
All of their lives

The underworld
Underworld
End
