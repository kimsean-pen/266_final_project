tuff ghost, tuff crowd, tuff love
sit down, sit down, sit down
tuff ghost, tuff crowd, tuff love

sit down, sit down, sit down

say something now
say something now
the tuff ghost disappears for 3 days

the tuff ghost is set in his ways
I don't want to hurt you

"well you can't, 'cuz I'm already dead"
the tuff ghost is invincible

no guts came out when he bled
"well I lift weights, but I don't sweat.
I go for a swim, but I don't get wet."
I don't care about anyone else
I'm a strong dead man, looking out for himself

I think you're suffering, that's why you're so mean
you're already dead
I can see right through you
see right through
see right through
right through you
see right through
see right through
see right through
see right through
