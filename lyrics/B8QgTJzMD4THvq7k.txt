Welcome to this world that we live in
Normal people going for a spin
And we don't realize
That it changes all our lives

Every day somebody's asking questions
Someone wants to know if I know
All the answers, or am I just guessing?
Guess we'll never really know

Sunday section gave us a mention
Grandma's freaking out over the attention
Now my friends abound
They're coming back around

Long distance on the other end
Says I need them for a friend
No matter what I choose
I'm the one they wanna use

Flip your wig
You've gotta flip your wig
Flip your wig
Gonna flip your wig

Flip your wig
You're gonna flip your wig
Flip your wig
Gotta flip your wig

Do I really know? (I don't know)
And do I really care? (I don't know)
And do we really know? (They don't know)
And do we really care? (They don't know)
And do I really know? (We thought we'd be)
And do I really care? (We'd be in love)
And do we really know? (I'm gonna flip your wig)
And do we really care? (I'm gonna flip your wig)
