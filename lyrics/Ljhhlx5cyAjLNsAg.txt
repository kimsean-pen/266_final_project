It's storming broken glass, corpses left in piles
Ungracious bludgeonmnet that breaks the earth for miles
Nothing can stop it, the day has come, from below it's catastrophic

Freezing, there's no healing
Families are dying
This world is shattered
All shattered

Life crushing turbulence, this wrath can't be denied
Wishing you could help your friends, standing where they died
Echoes haunting, a hollow planet, lacerations, dissected nation

Freezing, there's no healing
Everyone's dying
This world is shattered
All shattered

Freezing, there's no healing
Everyone's dying
This world is shattered
All shattered
All shattered
All shattered
