Just a little thin around the ribs
Wondering why did it have to be like this
Tried to have you fall in love with me

Held you up for a while but you proved too tough - baby, baby
Let you off with smile never asked too much - baby, baby

I'll get back on my balloon
And meet my baby on the moon
Hanging flowers in her room
And dancing just to keep my cool, to keep my cool

Chased you up to the sky and my wings fell off - baby, baby
Held my paws up and cried and you watched me fall - baby, baby

I'll get back on my balloon
And meet my baby on the moon
Hanging flowers in her room
And dancing just to keep my cool, to keep my cool

I'll get back on my balloon
And meet my baby on the moon
Hanging flowers in her room
And dancing just to keep my cool, to keep my cool

I'll get back on my balloon
And meet my baby on the moon
Hanging flowers in her room
And dancing just to keep my cool, to keep my cool
