Rose, I'm feeling older
I was as lucky as a four-leaved clover
I tried to be happy, it wasn't easy
When I choose my color, it will be
Razzle dazzle rose

Rose, I'm feeling older
Courage, my love, it makes me bolder
Expecting softness can lead to foolishness
When I choose my color, it will be
Razzle dazzle rose
