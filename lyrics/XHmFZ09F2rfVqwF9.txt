I'm 23
I still feel the same, maybe?
This ain't about you
This is about me
I can't help the way I am
No one seems to understand

I'm not alright but really it's fine
I like to be alone most of the time
Talking to myself with nobody else
And that's the way that I like it
The way that I like it

Is it all in my head, what they said?
I'm not feeling too good
I'm feeling misunderstood
Is it all in my head, what they said?
I'm not feeling too good
I would cry if I could

I drive fast so I can feel something
I ruin my own life just for nothing
I fall in and out of love with everything
I really don't know what I'm doing

Is it all in my head, what they said?
I'm not feeling too good
I'm feeling misunderstood
Is it all in my head, what they said?
I'm not feeling too good
I would cry if I could

I drive fast so I can feel something
I drive fast so I can feel something

Is it all in my head, what they said?
I'm not feeling too good
I'm feeling misunderstood
But is it all in my head, what they said?
I'm not feeling too good
I would cry if I could

I drive fast so I can feel something
I drive fast so I can feel something
I drive fast so I can feel something
(I'm not feeling too good, I'm feeling misunderstood)
I drive fast so I can feel something
(I'm not feeling too good, I would cry if I could)
I drive fast so I can feel something
I drive fast so I can feel something
I drive fast so I can feel something
I drive fast so I can feel something
