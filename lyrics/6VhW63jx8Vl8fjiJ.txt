I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right...

As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I, to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on
The wind ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the Man In The Mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have
Been any clearer
If they wanna make the world
A better place
Take a look at yourself
And then make a change
(Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah)

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me
Pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed - out dream
(Washed - out dream)
They follow the pattern of
The wind, ya' see
Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the Man In The Mirror
(Ooh!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Ooh!)
And no message could have
Been any clearer
If you wanna make the world
A better place
Take a look at yourself and
Then make a change
I'm starting with the Man In The Mirror
(Ooh!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Change his ways - ooh!)
And no message could've
Been any clearer
If you wanna make the world
A better place
Take a look at yourself and
Then make that...

Change!
I'm starting with the Man In The Mirror
(Man In The Mirror - oh yeah!)
I'm asking him to change
His ways
(Better change!)
No message could have
Been any clearer
(If you wanna make the
World a better place)
(Take a look at yourself and
Then make the change)
(You gotta get it right, while
You got the time)
('Cause when you close your heart)
You can't close your... your mind!
(Then you close your... mind!)
That man
(Man In The Mirror, oh yeah!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
No message could have
Been any clearer
If you wanna make the world
A better place
Take a look at yourself and
Then make a change
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah
(Oh yeah!)
Gonna feel real good now!
Na Na Na Na Na Na

I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good!
Come on!
(Change...)
Just lift yourself
You know
You've got to stop it.
Yourself!
(Yeah! - make that change!)
I've got to make that change
Today!
Hoo!
(Man In The Mirror)
You got to
You got to not let yourself...
Brother...
Hoo!
(Yeah! - make that change!)
You know - I've got to get
That man, that man...
You've got to
You've got to move!
Come On!
Come on!
You got to...
Stand up! Stand up!
Stand up!
Stand up and lift
Yourself, now!
(Man In The Mirror)
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
Aaow!
(Yeah - make that change)
Gonna make that change...
Come on!
(Man In The Mirror)
You know it!
You know it!
You know it!
You know...
(Change...)
Make that change
