Well I see ya standing there like a rabid dog
And you got those crying eyes
Makes me wanna surrender and wrap you in my arms
You know I try to live without regrets
I'm always moving forward and not looking back
But I tend to leave a trail of dead, while I'm moving ahead
So I'm stepping away
Ahahaahahah...
'Cause I got nothing to say

Feels like, feels like it's coming
It feels like, feels
It's like a coming of age
Feels like, feels like it's coming
It feels like, feels like a coming of age

And when my fear pulls me out to sea
And the stars are hidden by my pride and my enemies
I seem to hurt the people that I care the most
Just like an animal I protect my pride
When I'm too bruised to fight
And even when I'm wrong I tend to think I'm right
Well I'm bored of the game
And too tired to rage

Feels like, feels like it's coming
It feels like, feels
It's like a coming of age
Feels like, feels like it's coming
It feels like, feels like a coming of age

Feels like, feels like it's coming
It feels like, feels
It's like a coming of age
Feels like, feels like it's coming
It feels like, feels like a coming of age

Feels like, feels like it's coming
It feels like, feels
It's like a coming of age
Feels like, feels like it's coming
It feels like, feels like a coming of age
