Piercing his eyes
Scars you can't see
Cutting profound
Places you don't want to be
Climbing a mountain
Crossing a sea

Behind
The struggle has ended
Damaged mind
Already descended

Acting out
Striving to make me secure

The gutter parts us
From the rain
Up on the hill
Tough and alone
Perfectly filling
His desolate throne

Behind
The struggle has ended
Damaged mind
Already descended

Acting out
Securing me

Friendly betrayal
Somber delight
Treating his tumor
Without a fight
