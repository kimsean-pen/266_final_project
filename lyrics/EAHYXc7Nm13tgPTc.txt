If I could go back to a time before now
Before I ever fell down
Go back to a time when I was just a girl
When I had the whole world
Gently wrapped around me

And no good thing could be taken away
If I still believe that hearts don't lie
You're gonna be just fine
But, babe

A lot's gonna change
In your lifetime
Try to leave it all behind
In your lifetime

Born in a century lost to memories
Falling trees, get off your knees
No one can keep you down
If your friends and your family
Sadly don't stick around
It's high time you'll learn to get by

'Cause you got what it takes
In your lifetime
Try to leave it all behind
In your lifetime

Let me change my words
Show me where it hurts
