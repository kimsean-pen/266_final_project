Everywhere I go
I see reasons
For the pain
To subside
We're the same
But different people
And now we have gone
And thrown this aside

But are we not answerable to committing a crime
I thought us invincible, I'm losing my mind

Over and done, a changing of seasons
The sun that ignited our feelings is down
And I'm overcome if love was the reason
Why am I on the run and
So let's turn this around
Before we're over and done

Anywhere I turn
There's an answer
For my soul to retrain
What was real
Has no longer meaning
Still I feel I belong
In a world around you

But are we responsible for creating a lie
Is love unforgivable, My life's on the line
And is it over this time

Over and done, a changing of seasons
The sun that ignited our feelings is down
And I'm overcome if love was the reason
Why am I on the run and
So let's turn this around
Before we're over and done
