carry within

a fear
that blossoms on skin

forever alone

sorrow says
bury my bones

carry within
regret
for everything

tear old pain away

I renounce this day and
I renounce every wound
made in my flesh
made by my flesh

are you awake? what did you see?

I'm a sudden hissing,
right behind your ear.
a white noise

but it's quiet now

I am reason
I am fear

inflict.

I call out
and you fear me

I call out
and all the brothers in the world they hear me

but the pain remains the same
