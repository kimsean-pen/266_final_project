I don't want you to think that I see through you
When all I see is the reflection of who you are not
I never asked you to contemplate all the things
Whispered in secret while sitting with you in the park

I find out who you are
I lose you in the dark
Though you're not too far
You're further to admire

But I breathe easily in your arms
But I breathe easily where you are
Just breathe
Breathe in
Just breathe
Breathe in
Just

Help me in ways of submission
My body's itching to press on the bruises you hide with a smile
Love to incessantly hate me
I'll cry
But just for a while

I find out who you are
I lose you in the dark
And now you've gone too far
Your shadow is alive

But I breathe easily in your arms
But I breathe easily where you are
Just...
Just...
Just breathe
Breathe in
Just breathe
Breathe in
Just breathe
Breathe in
Just breathe
Breathe in
Just breathe

But I breathe easily in your arms
But I breathe easily where you are
But I breathe easily in your arms
