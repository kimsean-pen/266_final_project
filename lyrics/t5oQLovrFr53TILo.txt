Girl, the only thing that matters in my life
Is that I'm down for you and treat you right
You've got no call to treat me cold as ice

Oh-oh-oh, girl
As long as I've been givin' my love to you
You should be givin' me your love, too, oh
But you just keep on actin' just like a fool
You know it ain't cool

Don't be cruel
'Cause I would never be that cruel to you
Uh-no, oh, uh-no don't be cruel
Girl, you need to change your attitude
Uh-no, oh don't be cruel

Hey yo' Kimmy what's up with this attitude
I thought I was bein' real - good to you
I treat you sweet, take you out at night
But you never say thanks girl
That ain't right

I bought you diamonds even gave you pearls
I took you for a cruise all around the world
I treat you high post but you play me close
If I want to drink up you won't even toast

Girl, I work so hard for you from 9 to 5
So you could have the finer things - in life
Since you're the kind that's never satisfied

Oh-oh-oh, girl
As longs as I've been givin' my heart to you
You should be givin' me your heart, too, oh
But you just keep on actin' just like a fool
You know it ain't cool

Don't be cruel
'Cause I would never be that cruel to you
Uh-no, oh, uh-no don't be cruel
Girl, you need to change your attitude
Uh-no, oh
Don't be cruel

From fancy cars to diamond rings
I've just about given you everythin'
There's really not much I won't -
do for you
I bought you 12 yellow roses and candy, too

I like to be up front and never play the back
But the way you treat me, girl, is like a heart attack
I'm real troop trooper and with all the times
That you were by my side diggin' dollars outta crock

Oh-oh-oh, girl
As long as I've been givin' my love to you
You should be givin' your me your love, too, oh
But you just keep on actin' just like a fool
You know it ain't cool
It just ain't cool
Don't be cruel
Uh-no, oh

We used to hang out tough just kickin' around
We discovered a love that had never been found
You gave me your heart, I gave you my mind
But a true love affair we could never find

Although I want you bad I could let you go
'Cause there's a lot of girls out there that won't say no
But due to fact that I want you, Jackie
I want you more than human eyes can see

But you had to start givin', tryin' to make a killin'
Thought about the dollars I make and you were willin'
To be with me, Bobby B
But with a bad attitude I can't compete

Now you know my name, now I know your game
You want to be with me you got to be the same way
That another girl would be
And if you wanna be with me

Don't be cruel (don't be, don't be)
'Cause I would never be that cruel to you (don't be, don't be)
Uh-no, oh, uh-no don't be cruel
