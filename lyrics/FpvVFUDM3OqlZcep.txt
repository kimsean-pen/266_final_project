If you think the world is
a machine with one cog
And that cog is you,
or the things that you do
Then you are not in this world
The world is not you

If you think the world
is a balloon in your head
When it goes bang only
you will be dead
'Cos you are not in this world
The world is not you

If you think the world lies
at the top of your legs
And you only live when you are in bed
Then you are not in this world
The world is your head

If you think the world is
a clutter of existence
Falling through the air
with minimal resistance
You could be right, how would I know?
