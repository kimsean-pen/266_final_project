This is a hate song
Just meant for you
I thought that I'd write it down

While I still could
I hope when you hear this
You'll want to sue

Oh it's a lonely life
In my- empty bed
And it's a quiet life
That leaks- from my head
These are the last rites
The line is dead
(Dead)

(Dead)

Yes, I'm hearing voices too
And I'm more cut up than you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
