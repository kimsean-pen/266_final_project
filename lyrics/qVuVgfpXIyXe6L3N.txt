I feel safe when we are standing in the wreckage
Are we hopeless pulled in opposite directions
Just when I thought that I could be lonely any longer
You start to pull me under when I try to keep my head above the water

True moments shake we can't be right
On our mistakes
Love is on the fault line
The things we say
When we're both mad
We ricochet, love is on a fault line
And we both know
You will never never gonna change
But we're holding on till we feel it break
It's too late to be the first to walk away
When your love is on the fault line

You kissed me too hard
I thought you had the best intentions
You took it too far
Always desperate for attention
Just when I was thinking that it couldn't be lonely any longer
You start to pull me under when I try to keep my head above the water

True moments shake we can't be right
On our mistakes
Love is on the fault line
The things we say
When we're both mad
We ricochet, love is on a fault line
And we both know
You will never never change
But we're holding on till we feel it break
It's too late to be the first to walk away
When your love is on the fault line

I'm scared that I am drowning in in the open sea
Standing in the shore not even noticing
Just when I was thinking it couldn't be lonely any longer

True moments shake we can't be right
On our mistakes
Love is on the fault line
The things we say
When we're both mad
We ricochet, love is on a fault line
And we both know
You will never never change
But we're holding on till we feel it break
It's too late to be the first to walk away
When your love is on the fault line

I feel safe when we are standing in the wreckage
