Well I was driving lonely
No passenger to hold me
Ambition drove the appeal
Keeping up with the burning
Race with as it's turning
Stay focused behind the wheel

I would say I'm ok
I would say yeah I'm fine
Wear my tears on the inside
But just when I believe
That I'd lost all my need
You crash right into my life

And there's no brakes
There's no heart breaks
Love overtakes
Love overtakes
No brakes
There's no heart brakes
Love overtakes
Love overtakes

Some people spend there earnings
On never ending journey
They always seek never find
I couldn't keep on moving
Driving without moving
My heart is losing its stride

I would say it's ok
I would say yeah it's fine
Ignore what's missing inside
But just when I believe
There's nothing left in me
You crash right into my life

And there's no brakes
There's no heart breaks
Love overtakes
Love overtakes
No brakes
There's no heart brakes
Love overtakes
Love overtakes (x2)

Sometimes you don't know what's missing
Until it overtakes you
And it overtakes everything
And from that moment
You don't quite know
How you ever got along without it

No brakes
No heartbreaks
No heartbreaks

I would say I'm ok
I would say yeah I'm fine
With my tears on the inside
But just when I believed
That I'd lost all my need
You crash right into my life

And there's no brakes
No heart breaks
Love over takes
No brakes
There's there's no heart brakes
Love overtakes

And there's no brakes
Love overtakes (x2)
No brakes
Love overtakes (x2)
