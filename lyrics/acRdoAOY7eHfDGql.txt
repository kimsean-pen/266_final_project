I passed you today
You don't hold yourself
The same way you used to
Back when you, you still had a smile

It's cold outside
And that train is not taking you home

Condemned to live on the threshold

There is no love for you
Stripped from your birth right, birth right is death
Where were they when you needed them
Unwanted children of this lonely world

Misery loves company
Chained to misery

Keep your head high however you can
Topping up so you don't hollow out

To replace where your heart used to be

Keep your head high however you can
Topping up so you don't hollow out

Sick with jealously of all with love in their lives
Guarded backs

On the threshold of the warmth of your world
And the bleakness outside

Just for a glimpse of your world
I'd do fucking anything

Stuck in purgatory
Trapped in death's waiting room

That train came in the end
Fade into the night
