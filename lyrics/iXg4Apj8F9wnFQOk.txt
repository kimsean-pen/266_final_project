You couldn't even show yourself out,
you were so held up by your thoughts
along the way we got divided.
And I'm not showing you the door, couldn't look me in the eyes.

So I'll dim the lights
when you take me out on your side.
We're standing out of sight.
Believe me, I'm on your side.

It took so long for me to speak up,
it was the hardest thing to say.
Taken right up to the entrance,
at the last minute turned away, just can't look you in the eyes.

So let's dim the lights,
get a case out, bag up your pride.
It's over, we're out of time.
Don't leave me, I'm on your side.

For everything that could have been,
but at least we took the ride.
There's no relief in bitterness,
might as well let it die.
