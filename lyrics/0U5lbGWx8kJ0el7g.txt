I've got cash on my table
I've got dirt on my floor
I've got ghosts in my closet
I've never seen before
I've got angry neighbours
I've got bills to pay
I wanna stay in this moment

Oh no
I don't wanna go home
No no no
I don't wanna go home
No no no
I don't wanna go home
No no no
I don't wanna go home
No no no
I don't wanna go home

I don't wanna go home

I've got cash on my table
I've got dirt on my floor
I've got ghosts in my closet
I've never seen before
I've got angry neighbours
I've got bills to pay
I wanna stay in this moment

Oh no
I don't wanna go home
No no no
I don't wanna go home
No no no
I don't wanna go home
No no no
I don't wanna go home
No no no
I don't wanna go home ...
