Everything you do is planned out in advance
The stars push their dark wills down on you
And wolves all tear themselves apart better in packs
That's just a function we'll have to work on through
We are machines that eat and breathe and look really cool
You're reacting just the way I thought you would
But I've replaced my heart with metal parts
And I'm working just fine, but I can't get it to start
We are machines that breathe and weep and look really good trained to kill
Send me back in time and I'll bring us back in line
Just tell me whose mother I have to kill
I'm fine like I've always been, except I don't remember-when
My conscience wasn't acting up again
We're living on borrowed time
And it looks like they want it back
