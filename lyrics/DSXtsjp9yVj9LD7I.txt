Well, Kim's got the answer with her watermelon gun
And all the celebrities want permission
But she won't give it to them
Till they learn how to love

Kim's got her watermelon gun
It's the consciousness of love
Now Kim's got her watermelon gun
It's the consciousness of love

And wouldn't it be dumb
If all their atrocities were just forgiven?
But she won't give that to them
Till they learn how to love

And Kim's got her watermelon gun
It's the consciousness of love
And Kim's got her watermelon gun
'Cause it's the consciousness of love

She won't give it to them
She won't give it to them
She won't give it to them
