Is this my last breath? I can't breathe
I'm choking on my own condescending words.
Answer me
Will you ever answer me?
Are you gonna answer me?
When I am crying out your name and I'm lost in shame.
Lead me on my way
And give me words to say.
(Words to say)

'Cause I can't see
That I've lost my dreams
Carry me, cause my heart is weak
Is this my last breath?
Is this my last breath?

I can't sleep
This world inside my head is run by my anxious thoughts
Give me peace
Will you bring me off my knees?
Are you gonna answer me?
When I am crying out your name and I'm lost in shame.
Lead me on my way
And give me words to say.
(Words to say)

'cause I can't see
That I've lost my dreams
Carry me, cause my heart is weak
Is this my last breath?
Is this my last breath?

I've been trying aimlessly, over & over
To fill this void inside of me.
My mind's in a cage
And I'm on my knees.
(On my knees)

I can feel the shift go inside my head
Am I going crazy?

And I can't see, that I've lost my dreams
(This is is my last breath)
Carry me, cause my heart is weak
(This is is my last breath)
I can't see, that I've lost my dreams, yeah
And carry me
(You gonna answer me?)
Cause my heart is weak
Answer me!
