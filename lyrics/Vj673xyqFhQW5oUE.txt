An inch ahead of the event horizon
Your pupils pinpoints and mine gigantic
I watch the wind in distant trees
(Can we shut the lights, please)
The possibilities in standard tuning

Hands have X's, I'm visibly trashed
Streetlights flicker on as we pass them
You light a Salem you stole from your aunt
And you're just so handsome
That I have to laugh when

You say the same blood runs through us
Me, though, I maintain that I'm different
Years passed and I wish I could show you
And I wish that I told you

Eleven months and not a word from you
But then, out of the Long Dark Blue
Like a busted dealer
Like a son or daughter
You hit the showers
And I feel so old when

You say the same blood runs through us
Me, though, I maintain that I'm different
Years pass and I wish I could show you
And I wish that I told you

You say "gravitational waves move through me"
You sound sedated
I ask you what happened
Years passed and I wish I could show you
Wish I could hold you
