Ocean air
in your hair
Blowing
everywhere

Please don't go,
I want you to know
I'll love you, always

I remember when I saw you
Sitting alone, sitting alone
You were happy when you saw me
Noticing you noticing me

I remember when I saw you
Sitting alone, sitting alone
You were happy when you saw me
Noticing you noticing me
