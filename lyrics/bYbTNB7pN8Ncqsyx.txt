What you tryin' to do to my heart
What you tryin' to do to my heart
You go around
Tellin' lies
And now you wanna compromise
what you tryin' to do to my heart
you better run,
You better hide,
You better leave,
From my side, yeah

What you tryin' to do to my soul
What you tryin' to do to my soul
When everything I have is yours
And now I'm closing all the doors
What you tryin' to do to my soul
you better run,
You better hide,
You better leave,
From my side, yeah

I love you oh
I love you so
Can't you see it,
Don't you know
I can't stand your alibis
you're tellin' lies,
Tell me why,
Yeah

Say what are you tryin' to do to my head
Say what you tryin' to do to my head
Well now I'm gonna draw that line
'cause you ain't gonna take my mind
What are you tryin' to do to my head

you better run,
You better hide,
You better leave,
From my side,

you better run,
You better hide,
You better leave,
From my side,

I said yeah,
Yeah
I said go away
And leave me alone
I can't stand you no more
