Someday you'll find the place
It's the place where love takes over hate
Then you'll see all the things you do
Affect everyone around you

Then you'll see there's no fear at all
You held my hand we took down that wall
As I looked at you with nothing to say
Now I understand why you pushed me away
I looked far and now I see
That the only one I needed was me

I looked far and now I see
That the only one who I needed was me
