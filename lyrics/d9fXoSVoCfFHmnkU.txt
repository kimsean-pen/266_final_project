I think I met my match again
Standing 'round the candlelight
In the middle of this blizzard
You stood and melted all the ice

Oh, it's only love
Oh, it's only love
Oh, if only love comes 'round again
It will have been worth the ride

You were master of so many
Savior to none
I waged all of my hopes so plenty on you
Now, look what I've become

Oh, it's only love
Oh, it's only love
Oh, if only love comes 'round again
It will have been worth the ride
And what a ride

Sometimes, lonely is not only a word
Faces I have known
And if you see me, could you free me with a smile
So, I can let go?

Oh, it's only love
Oh, it's only love
Oh, if only love comes 'round again
It will have been

Comes 'round again
It will have been
Worth the ride, worth the ride
And what a ride

What a ride
