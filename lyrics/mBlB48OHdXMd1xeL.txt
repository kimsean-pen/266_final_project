You caught me doing push-ups in the morning
Before everyone else woke up
And then the sea dog busted in,
He was out all night getting chased by cops
And in this moment,
I was pretty pleased with the person I was pretending to be

I got them bad boy blues, baby
I got them bad boy blues, baby

When she asks me why they call me Brian instead of Steven,
I tell her it's got as much to do with personal
As it does professional reasons
I got a whole list of reasons I should stop before I start
But the only thing stronger than my head is my heart
I got them bad boy blues, baby
(I got them bad boy), I got them bad boy blues,
(Blues, baby) I feel hypnotized by the way you move
And those big brown eyes
Yea, that would be great
That would be beach house living
Every night, rest of our lives, you and me
We could go swimming, swimming
Yea, that would be great
That would be beach house living
Every night, rest of our lives, you and me
We could go swimming, swimming

I got them bad boy blues, baby
(I got them bad boy) I got them bad boy blues,
(Blues, baby) I feel hynotized by the way you move
And those big brown eyes
Yea, that would be great
That would be beach house living
Every night, rest of our lives, you and me
We could go swimming, swimming
(I got them bad boy) Yea, that would be great
(Blues, baby) That would be beach house living
Every night, rest of our lives, you and me
We could go swimming, swimming, swimming, swimming
Swimming, swimming, swimming, swimming
Swimming
