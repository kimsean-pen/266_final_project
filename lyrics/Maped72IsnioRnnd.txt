Everything is up to you, cause everything reminds you of her
Oh myyy
Oh myyy
Everything is up to you, cause everything reminds you of her
Oh myyy
Oh myyy

You can ask yourself
Every morning you wake up
Did I do enough to help
Enough to take the edge off
Everything is up to you, cause everything reminds you of her
Oh myyy
Oh myyy

So take a step instead of waiting
When everything feels complicated
All your life you needed to listen
Close your eyes use intuition
And all this time you've been waiting
And everything was my decision decision decision decision decision

Everything is up to you, cause everything reminds you of her
Oh myyy
Oh myyy
