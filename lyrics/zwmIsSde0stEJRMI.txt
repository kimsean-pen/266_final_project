Black tar and asphalt
The tile
Reads my message
On every corner
Hushed sounds
Winds
They whisper
Reanimate

Megaphone preacher
This town
Full of heroes
On every corner
A love
Everlasting
Repent and believe

Black water
Cupped to her lips
They open
She drinks
Black water
Cupped to her lips
Wide open
Revealing teeth
