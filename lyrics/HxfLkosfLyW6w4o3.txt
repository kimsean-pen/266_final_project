Come on baby, baby
Come on

Well you could chain it, you might
If it makes you feel fine
You could scream and shout
If it makes you feel happy
Singing oh yes
Let my baby, I let my baby, I let my
Ah yes
Yea baby

How come you got to make a fool of me?
When you know it's not true to me
Yea
I don't where or when you 'll ever see
But your plan keeps pulling me yea

How come you got to make a fool of me?
When all I ever said or do is scream
Yea yea yea
You go and try to make a fool of me
Oh, oh yeah (oh oh, oh oh)

I've got moving plan in my mind, aha
I gots a moment but it isn't in mind aha ah
And if you wanna be about my all take a number, baby get in line
Aha
Cause it's a bummer in the summer time
But everyone's gonna have a really good time
Oh yeah

But you never hand out
And you shake it all about
These arms and legs, bacon and eggs
And you can rearrange your mind
If it makes you feel fine yea
And you can lose your faith
If it puts you in your place
And you can chew on gum
If it makes you have fun
And you can drink green soup on the way from the kitchen
My worries gets a fiction

How come you got to make a fool of me?
When you know it's not true to me
How come you gotta go and step on my heart
When you know that's no way to start yea

How come you got to make a fool of me?
When all I ever said or do is scream
Yea yea yea
You go and try to make a fool of me
Oh yeah (oh oh, oh oh)

Oh I got the roofies and the discoth√®que inside my mind
All the time, all night yea
Doing groovy on another of those times aha ah
And if you wanna be the alltime runner of such time
Baby drop to keep on wining all night
Because you're freaking me out
And bring it down
Everyone's vibes yea aha ah

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Break it
