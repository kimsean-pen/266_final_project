...
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
...
All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh
...
I never had the least notion
...
That I could fall with so much emotion
...
Could you coo, could you care
...

For a cunning cottage we could share
...
The world will pardon my mush
...
Cause I've got a crush, my baby, on you
...
How glad the many millions ladies

From millionares to cadies

Would be, to capture me
...
But you had such persistence
You wore down my resistance
I fell, and it was swell
...
You're my big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you I shall never, never know
...
It's not that you're attractive
But oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view
...
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
...
All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh
...
I never had the least notion
...
That I could fall with so much emotion
...
Could you coo, could you care
...
For a cunning cottage we could share
...
The world will pardon my mush
...
Cause I've got a crush, my baby, on you
