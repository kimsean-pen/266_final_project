I went everywhere for you
I even did my hair for you
I bought new underwear - they're blue
And I wore 'em just the other day

Love, you know I'll fight for you
I left on the porch light for you
Whether you are sweet or cruel
I'm gonna love you - either way

Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love

Like a satellite
I'm in orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your love

Love, I got it bad for you
I saved the best I have for you
You sometimes make me sad and blue
Wouldn't have it any other way

Love, my aim is straight and true
Cupid's arrow is just for you
I even painted my toenails for you
I did it just the other day

Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love

Like a satellite
I'm in orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your...

Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love

Where you go - I'll follow
You set the pace, we'll take it fast or slow
I'll follow in your way

Oh, ah, ah

You got me
You got me!
A force more powerful than gravity
It's physic(s) - there's no escape!

Love, my aim is straight and true
Cupid's arrow is just for you
I even painted my toenails for you
I did it just the other day

Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love

Like a satellite
I'm in orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your...

Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love

Love, oh, love (love)
Love (love)...
Love (love)...
Love (love)!
