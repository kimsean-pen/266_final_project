Broken bones, broken hearts
Stripped down and torn apart
A little bit of rust - I'm still runnin'

Countin' miles, countin' tears
Twisted roads, shiftin' gears
Year after year - it's all or nothin'

But I'm not home, I'm not lost
Still holdin' on to what I got
Ain't much left
No there's so much that's been stolen
I guess I've lost everything I've had
But I'm not dead, at least not yet
Still alone, still alive, Still UNBROKEN
I'm still alone, still alive
I'M STILL UNBROKEN

Never captured, never tamed
Wild horses on the plains
You can call me lost - I call it FREEDOM

I feel the spirit in my soul
It's something Lord I can't control
I'M NEVER GIVIN UP WHILE I'M STILL BREATHIN!

I'm not home, I'm not lost
Still holdin' on to what I got
Ain't much left
Lord there's so much that's been stolen
I guess I've lost everything I've had
I'm not dead, at least not yet
Still alone, still alive, Still UNBROKEN
I'm still alone, still alive
STILL UNBROKEN
I'm still unbroken
Still Unbroken

Like the wind, like the rain
It's all runnin through my veins
Like a river pouring down into the ocean

I'm out here on the streets
But I'm standing on my feet
Still alive, still alone, still unbroken

I'm not home, I'm not lost
Still holdin' on to what I got
Ain't much left
Lord there's so much that's been STOLEN
Guess I've lost everything I've had
But I'm not dead, at least not yet
Still alive, still alone, Still Unbroken
I'm still alone, still alive
I'M STILL UNBROKEN
I'M STILL ALONE!
STILL ALIVE!
STILL UNBROKEN!
I'M STILL UNBROKEN!
I ain't never going down!
I'M STILL UNBROKEN!
Oooooooh-Ooooooh!
