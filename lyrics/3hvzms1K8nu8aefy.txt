I'm just gonna say it
There's no use in delaying
I'm tired of the angry
Hanging out inside me

So I'll quiet down the devil
I'm gonna knock him with a shovel
And I'll bury all my trouble
Underneath the revel

When I'm alone in a dark, dark room
I have to tell myself to

Think good thoughts, think good thoughts
Imagine what the world would be
If we will, we will just think good thoughts
Stop the bad from feeding

Oh, won't let the negativity turn me into my enemy
Promise to myself that I won't let it get the best of me
That's how I want to be
Nah nah nah...

I'm not saying that it's easy
Especially when I'm moody
I might be cursing like a sailor
Til I remind myself I'm better

Cause words can be like weapons
Oh, when you use them you'll regret them
Oh, but I'm not gonna let them (ho)
Take away my heaven (ho)

And when I start feeling blue
I remember to tell myself to (ho)

Think good thoughts, think good thoughts
Imagine what the world would be
If we will, we will just think good thoughts
Stop the bad from feeding

Oh, won't let the negativity turn me into my enemy
Promise to myself that I won't let it get the best of me
That's how I want to be

I just think of rain on summer nights
Stars filling up the sky, sun shining on my face
Making a secret wish, finding my happiness
That always makes me hold my head up high
I wanna hold my head up high

Oh, I wanna think good thoughts
Oh, imagine what the world would be
If we will, we just think good thoughts
Wouldn't that be something?

Oh, won't let the negativity turn me into my enemy
Promise to myself that I won't let it get the best of me
That's how I want to be (ho)

Nah nah nah...
