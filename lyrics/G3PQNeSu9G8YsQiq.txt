I'm burning out
I'm coming down like an asteroid
Crashing into earth

I'm spinning out
I'm spinning out of the orbit
Shooting off and it hurts

Oh, I'm so sick and tired of waiting
Trying to live in a daydream
Leaving it all behind

Oh, and it's getting harder to face it
Growing up, I can't take it
Letting it all unwind

Take me back to the day
When I could just run away
It's all made up anyways
No one really knows, oh

I'll figure it out someday
I'll lose a few, it's okay
At least I'll know the words to say
For once in my life

I will run as fast and far as I've wanted
Live the life that I should've started

Don't hold me down
Don't even try, no don't change me
I've made up my mind

I'm living now
And I don't care what they say
I'm leaving them behind

I'll figure it out someday
I'll lose a few, it's okay
At least I'll know the words to say
For once in my life

I will run as fast and far as I've wanted
Live the life that I should've started

Should've started...
Live the life that I should've started...
