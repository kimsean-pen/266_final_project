East mode, everybody striking a pose
Everybody's taxing my soul
They say it's all the rage, to never act your age
So what you're gonna hit me with next?
Darwin or a Crucifix?
So why you wanna do me like this?
It's always so extreme, but what's it really mean?

When you're begging for a brick
Just to throw it back and forth
And you call eachother sick
Yeah you're coming back for more
Back for more of what you love
Back for more of what you hate
You can't stop (stop, stop!)
'Cause you're already too late

So you kill your conscience, cry yourself to sleep
Kill your conscience, better you than me
You're all plugged in, ready and rehearsed
Do your best, do your worst, show me where it hurts
Kill your conscience
Kill your conscience
Yeah you're all plugged in, ready and rehearsed
Do your best, do your worst, show me where it hurts

Good luck (good luck)
Everybody's passing the buck (the buck)
Praying that they're making the cut (the cut)
They'll sell you by the pound and keep you underground

While you're scratching at the gates
Sscreaming "come on, let me in!"
Like a fully-loaded zombie throwing caution to the wind
Back for more of what you love
Back for more of what you hate
You can't stop (stop, stop!)
'Cause you're already too late

So you kill your conscience, cry yourself to sleep
Kill your conscience, better you than me
You're all plugged in, ready and rehearsed
Do your best, do your worst, show me where it hurts
Kill your conscience
Kill your conscience
Yeah you're all plugged in, ready and rehearsed
Do your best, do your worst, show me where it hurts

Kill your conscience, cry yourself to sleep
Kill your conscience, better you than me
You're all plugged in, ready and rehearsed
Do your best, do your worst, show me where it hurts
Kill your conscience
Kill your conscience
Yeah you're all plugged in, ready and rehearsed
Do your best, do your worst, show me where it hurts

Kill your conscience
Kill your conscience
Kill your conscience
Kill your conscience
Kill your conscience
