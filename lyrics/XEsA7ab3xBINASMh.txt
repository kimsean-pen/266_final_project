I'm cracking I wanna crack it
Give my tidings
I'll go when I wanna go, have to go
Blow that steam
The facts of a piece of plastic
Tough, won't crumble
A slap on a jelly ass
Don't you go and

Get into the building
Slide into a warm robe
Let me get you something
Hot to brave the coldest cold

A slip of a piece of fabric
Gives me hijinks
I'll go when I wanna go, self-control
Blow that steam
A blast from an automatic
Smooth, no jamming
A slap on a jelly ass
Don't you go and

Get into the building
Slide into a warm robe
It's been building all my life
A soft whisper for the last time

Want to tell you that I
Want to tell you that I
Want to tell you that I
Want to tell you that I
Want to tell you that I
Want you
