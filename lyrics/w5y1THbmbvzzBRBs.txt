I once had a girlfriend
But then one day she dumped me
And everywhere I'd go people would ask me
Where she was.
I don't wanna talk about her
Someone always asks about her
So I tell them all
"My girlfriend's dead"

I say it's leukemia
Or sometimes bulimia
Or a great big truck ran her over
And chopped off her head

I don't wanna talk about her
Someone always asks about her
So I tell them all
"She's dead!"

I guess there's a part of me
That likes the sympathy
Or the looks on their faces when I tell them
How she passed away

I don't wanna talk about her
Someone always asks about her
So I tell them all
"She's dead!"

(My girlfriend's dead)
My girlfriend's dead you see
It's a total lie but it's easier on me
Than having to admit that she likes someone else
(My girlfriend's dead)
My girlfriend's dead you know
Please change the subject
I'm going to go jump off a building
and join her in hell

I don't wanna talk about her
Someone always asks about her
So I tell them all
"She's dead!"
