Red skies at night, red skies at night
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh, oh
Red skies at night, red skies at night
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh, oh

Should have taken warning
It's just people mourning, running, hiding, lost
Couldn't find, find a place to go
So it's red skies at night, red skies at night
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh, oh

Should have taken warning
It was just people ignoring, running, hiding, lost
Couldn't find, find a place to go
So it's red skies at night, red skies at night
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh, oh

Red skies at night, red skies at night
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
So someone's taking over
And it looks like they're aiming right at you and me
And everybody, everybody
Someone says, "We could be dead by morning"
Someone cries, oh, oh, leaving

Red eyes at night, red eyes at night
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh, oh

Red skies at night, red skies at night, red skies at night
Red skies at night, red skies at night, red skies at night
Red skies at night, red skies at night, red skies at night
Red skies at night, red skies at night, red skies at night

Red skies at night
Red skies at night, red skies at night
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh, oh
Red skies at night, red skies at night
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh
Red skies at night, red skies at night
Oh oh, woh woh oh, oh oh oh
