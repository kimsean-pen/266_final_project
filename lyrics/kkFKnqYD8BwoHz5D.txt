watch the waves so far away
they're washing cross the paths that i have made

leaving all my sins i turn away
like soaring birds i watch my sorrows play

don't you know
i've left and gone away
you're knocking on the door i closed today
and everything looks brighter
the waves they just soothe my pain away

it felt so good to see the sun
i'll choose my time before i choose the one

floating cross the waves the silence runs
my thoughts can go but now my sorrows done
(repeat chorus)
