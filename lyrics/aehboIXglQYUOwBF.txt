Any wasp that I see
It's a fig wasp
Pearly guillotine
It's a fig wasp
When the harvest's clean
It's a fig wasp
It's a winged machine
It's a fig wasp

Any wasp that I see
It's a fig wasp
Pearly guillotine
It's a fig wasp
When the harvest's clean
It's a fig wasp
It's a winged machine
It's a fig wasp

Does your God know
Insects grow
In my pome?

BIG FIG WASP!

Any wasp that I see
It's a fig wasp
Pearly guillotine
It's a fig wasp

Ficain eating corpses
There's a hornet
In my throat!

BIG FIG WASP!

My body's overworked
It's just the same I know
When can my body work
Cold static overload?
My body works, I know
It's just the same I know
My only difference
Is robot influence

I'm up here for the weirdo swarm
I'm the door when you come for more

One, two, three!

Nonagon infinity opens the door
Nonagon infinity opens the door
Wait for the answer to open the door
