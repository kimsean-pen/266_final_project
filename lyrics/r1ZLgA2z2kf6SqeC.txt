Here's a story
Of lover's finding
Union so deep
There is no unwinding
Tender threads exquisitely finding
Two lives together
One soul deep resounding

Love so strong whatever the weather
Even apart our souls are together
It's you and me, babe, forever and ever
Even apart we're dreaming together

One, one

Suddenly all time and space
Loses it's meaning when I see your face
And I'm wrapped up in heaven's grace
Feeling so safe in your sweet embrace

One, one, one...
