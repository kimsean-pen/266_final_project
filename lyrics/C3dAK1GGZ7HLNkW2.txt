I can't sleep tonight
Everybody's saying everything is alright
Still I can't close my eyes
I'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lights

Sunny days
Where have you gone?
I get the strangest feeling you belong

Why Does It Always Rain on Me?
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?
Why Does It Always Rain on Me?
Even when the sun is shining
I can't avoid the lightning

I can't stand myself
I'm being held up by invisible men
Still life on a shelf when
I got my mind on something else

Sunny days
Oh where have you gone?
I get the strangest feeling you belong

Why Does It Always Rain on Me?
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?
Why Does It Always Rain on Me?
Even when the sun is shining
I can't avoid the lightning

Oh where did the blue sky go?
Why is it raining so?
It's so cold

I can't sleep tonight
Everybody's saying everything is alright
Still I can't close my eyes
I'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lights

Sunny days
Oh where have you gone?
I get the strangest feeling you belong

Why Does It Always Rain on Me?
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?
Why Does It Always Rain on Me?
Even when the sun is shining
I can't avoid the lightning
Oh where did the blue sky go?
And why is it raining so?
It's so cold

Why Does It Always Rain on Me?
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?
Why Does It Always Rain on Me?
Even when the sun is shining
I can't avoid the lightning
Why Does It Always Rain on Me?
Why Does It Always Rain on, on-
