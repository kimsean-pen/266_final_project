A thousand times I wait
Yeah I've been lying awake
The time ain't right oh let me go
Time ain't right oh wait, hey
I've got lots to give
Baby knows the deal
When I ride on it, yeah
You know I don't miss

Riding on a wave
I've been on a wave
I've been on a wave
I been on a wave
I've been on a wave
Got me on a wave
Got me on a wave
Got me on a wave
Got me on a wave
Wave

Got me on a wave
Oooh, and I will never let anyone stop it
(Got me on a wave)
Hey yeah and I never wanna give you up
(Got me on a wave)
People wanna say what they wanna say
They gone let us say
We don't give a damn what anyone thinks
We don't give a damn what anyone thinks
People want to say what they wanna say
They gone let us say
We don't give a damn what anyone thinks
We don't even care what anyone says

I got you look at me and you do
A Hundred things I could spend it all on you
Show me the light in your waves
Rollin through the night in a Wraith
You can hit me in the night time I can come through
Any given moment me and you
Lately I've been countin the days and nights
I'm trying to be the best I can be
Oooh love baby
Oooh love baby
All ridin
Feels right when you got me on the wave, oooh
Swimmin in LA, to you

Imma ride it until the brakes come off
I never put the blame on you
Baby I can ride all day
Baby I can ride your wave
Oooh got me on a wave
Got me on a wave
(Lay na na na na na na)
I won't lose
I'm not wastin away alone
Oh no

Got me on a wave
I've been on a wave
I've been on a wave
I've been on a wave
Ridin on a wave
Got me on a wave
Got me on a wave
Got me on a wave
Got me on a wave
A wave

Got me on a wave
Oooh, and I will never let anyone stop it
Got me on a wave
Hey yeah and I never wanna give you up, oooh
