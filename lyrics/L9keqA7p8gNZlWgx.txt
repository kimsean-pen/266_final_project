Let's take it right back to where we used to go
But we never look back
No, we only look forward to other new pain
And violence turned to blame
No, we never look back

No, we only look forward with all our faith
Hearts broken from the start
With the feel that we were born to a fault
Only to be held tall by the writing on the wall
We don't need no premonitions, no

Let's take it right back to where it all began
But we never look back
No, we only look forward to all the new shame
And waste of what we gain
Still, we never look back

No, we only look forward with all our faith
Hearts broken from the start
With the feel that we were born to a fault
Only to be held tall by the writing on the wall
We don't need no premonitions, no

Let's it take it right back to where we used to go
But we never look back

No, we only look forward with all our faith
Hearts broken from the start
With the feel that we were born to a fault
Only to be held tall by the writing on the wall
We don't need no premonitions, no

We don't need no premonitions, no
