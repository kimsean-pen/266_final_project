There's a lot of me
Take it off
Glitter and gloss runs deep
Like a silver screen
Take me back
Show me what I failed to see

Will you spell it out
You spell to me
When you take me to A to Z
Are we black or white
Or in between
Are the figures where they used to be

Like an empty canvas, hear me cry
Like a masterpiece, I'm in your eyes
Now your colors are all in front of me
Where picture-perfect ought to be

I'm a lot like you
Pretty shape
Layered and laid in dirt
Let the blood run wild
What I feel
Show me how to make it real

Will you spell it out
You spell to me
Where you're taking me from A to Z
Are we black or white or in between
Are the figures where they used to be

Like an empty canvas here me cry
Like a masterpiece, I'm in your eyes
Where your colors are in front of me
Where picture-perfect ought to be

The streets are full of lives
And they're all dressed up like they know me
But I don't mind that I'm alone
'Cause in all else aside
I think of you, how you told me
Love will be shy and never owned

Let it go 'til you can't
Go where you stay
Moments true [?]
Take what [?]
Really that's what they say
When you're lost in the light
Love is the shadow of lies
Playing games in the dust
Dreams of glitter and gloss

When you're lost in the light
Love is the shadow of lies
Playing games in the dust
Dreams of glitter and gloss
