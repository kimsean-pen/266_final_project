It breaks my heart 'cause I know you're the one for me
Don't you feel sad there never was a story obviously?

It never be, oh

And you will never know
I will never show
What I feel, what I need from you, no

And you will never know
I will never show
What I feel, what I need from you

And with every smiles come my reality: irony
You won't find out what has been killing me

Can't you see me, can't you see?

And you will never know
I will never show
What I feel, what I need from you, no

And you will never know
I will never show
What I feel, what I need from you, no, no

You will never know
I will never show
What I feel, what I need from you

No, no, no, no, you'll never know
No, no, no, you'll never know
No, no, no

Love me, love me, love me, love me, no

And you will never know
I will never show
What I feel, what I need from you, no, no

You will never know
I will never show
What I feel, what I feel, what I feel

What I need, what I need from you, no!
