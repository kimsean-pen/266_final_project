HELP!

The air turns black
The birds drop from the sky
This eagle has landed
I'm choking on your pride

And the walls are closing in
And you don't appreciate
That in my hands tonight
Is where your fate lies
Her face drains...

Stand up, take a bow you have
No reason to celebrate
You're lost in the labyrinth
Scream now it's not too late

The air turns black
The birds drop from the sky
This eagle has landed
I'm choking on your pride

And the walls are closing in
And you don't appreciate
That in my hands tonight
Is where your fate lies
Her face drains...

Stand up, take a bow you have
No reason to celebrate
You're lost in the labyrinth
Scream now it's not too late

Nothing seems to break the walls down
We'll break the walls down

Well, it looks like the end of tonight for our friend here
He's finding it hard to keep his head
Especially with his girl screaming in his ear
We've gotta ask ourselves, do they deserve this
Speak now or forever hold your peace

Will he make it out
I hope he makes out
He's gonna make it out
He's gotta make it out
