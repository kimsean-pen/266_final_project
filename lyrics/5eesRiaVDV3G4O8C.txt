All dressed up
Nowhere to go
TV's on
No one's home

Ring me up
I'm not there
Leave a message
Show you care

Meal for two
Eat for one
This place of worship
Has come undone

Shadow frame
Upon the wall
No photograph
To look out for

I'll be your gold angel
If you want me
I'll be your gold angel
Baby, you want me?

In the water
Like Maharaj
Changed your shade
Left the scars

Sand is dry
Cuts like glass
Heal my urge
Get here fast

I'll be your gold angel
If you want me
I'll be your gold angel
Baby, you want me?
I'll be your gold angel
If you want me
I'll be your gold angel
Baby, you want me?

Can't hide the mirror in your mind
You see me
Nothing is left for you to find
Give in to me
I hear your voice and it sounds like
A symphony
You lift me up, dead or alive
Now I'm not [?]

I'll be your gold angel
If you want me
I'll be your gold angel
Baby, you want me?
(Baby, you want me, say)
I'll be your gold angel
If you want me
I'll be your gold angel
Baby, you want me?

If you want me
Baby, you want me?
If you want me
Baby, you want me?
