Tell you that I love you, that I can't hold back
The feeling that you give me, wanna give right back
I know you always win at this particular game
I need to know the rules if you want me to play

You treat me like your boyfriend
And trust me like a - like a very best friend
Kiss me like your boyfriend
You call me up, like you want your best friend
You turn me on, like you want your boyfriend
But I don't wanna be your secret anymore

I'm trying to be honest cause I can't relax
When I get around you I can't hide the fact
I let you take advantage cause it felt so good
Blame myself for thinking we both understood

You treat me like your boyfriend
And trust me like a - like a very best friend
Kiss me like your boyfriend
You call me up, like you want your best friend
You turn me on, like you want your boyfriend
But I don't wanna be your secret anymore

Do you wanna, you wanna play the crying game
Do you feel the same? (Do you feel the same?)
Do you wanna, you wanna spin the bottle again
Do you feel the same? (Do you feel the same?)
You treat me like your boyfriend
And trust me like a - like a very best friend
Kiss me like your boyfriend
You call me up, like you want your best friend
You turn me on, like you want your boyfriend
But I don't wanna be your secret anymore
You treat me like your boyfriend
And trust me like a - like a very best friend
Kiss me like your boyfriend
You call me up, like you want your best friend
You turn me on, like you want your boyfriend
But I don't wanna be your secret anymore
