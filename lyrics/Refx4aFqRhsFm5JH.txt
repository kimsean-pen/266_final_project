Remember Mayan?
Future is being right now
Angels came pouring 'round
Made smoke owls
Painted and drifting in clouds

Remember Mayan?
Antique of the jungle and summer men
Knife of obsidian
Rain on sand
Holding your head in your hands

I can see them smiling
What a thing to be called king
What a thing to be called king

Now I feel like I'm wearing a canteen
Asleep by the fire
But I know I'll follow with you
And I know I'll follow with you

We'll meet in the rafters
We'll meet in the rafters

Remember Mayan?
Future is being right now
Angels came tearing down
Made smoke owls
Wait and they're drifting in clouds

Remember Mayan?
Antique of the jungle and summer, man
Knife of obsidian
Rain on sand
Holding your head in your hands

I can see them smiling
What a thing to be called king
What a thing to be called king
What a thing to be called king
What a thing to be called king
What a thing to be called king

That happens when I sleep too long
Rewind it cause you can't have the first time
That happens when I sleep too long
You rewinded cause you can't have a first time

I'll dream of your portrait
Asleep by the fire
I'll dream of your portrait
Sleep by the fire
I'll dream of your portrait
