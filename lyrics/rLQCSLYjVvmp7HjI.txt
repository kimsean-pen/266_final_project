Years of the clock go by
How long will you wait for a sign
It seems fiction is hard to break
Forward out of the darkness
Walls of time must fall
Kings and queens must die

Fiction is hard to break

Backwards is your fascination myth
Backwards is your fascination myth

Pillar of belief
Carrier of the key
Hold your hand up high

And the time won't wait
And the dreams still break
For in dawn,
For in dawn the light reveals

So now how do I live without you?
It seems you've had a lot of time to work it out
What do you think we're gonna do?
You are the ones who build up walls around yourselves
To shield your lives from fear

When faced with divinity
Do you all pay all your dues?
Or do you refuse?

If there was no consequence
Could you stay inside the lines?
Leave your guilt behind?

Those lips... Crooked sadistic words
Don't waste your turn
Save us from the nonexistent
Teaching that suffering is love

Suffering is love
Suffering is love
Suffering is love
Suffering is love

Suffering is not love
