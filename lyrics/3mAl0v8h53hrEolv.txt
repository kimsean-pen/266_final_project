I thought that I could always count on you,
I thought that nothing could become between us two.
We said as long as we would stick together,
We'd be alright
We'd be ok

But I was stupid
And you broke me down
I'll never be the same again.

So thank you for showing me
That best friends can not be trusted
And thank you for lying to me
Your friendship and good times we had you can have 'em back

Yeah!

I wonder why it always has to hurt
For every lesson that you have to learn
I won't forget what you did to me
How you showed me things
I wish I'd never seen

But I was stupid
And you broke me down
I'll never be the same again

So thank you for showing me
That best friends can not be trusted
And thank you for lying to me
Your friendship the good times we had you can have 'em back

When the tables turn again
You'll remember me my friend
You'll be wishing I was there for you

I'll be the one you'll miss the most
But you'll only find my ghost
As time goes by
You'll wonder why
You're all alone

So thank you for showing me
That best friends can not be trusted
And thank you for lying to me
Your friendship and good times we had you can have 'em back

So thank you, for lying to me
So thank you, for all the times you let me down
So thank you, for lying to me
So thank you, your friendship you can have it back
