Every time I close my eyes
I see a vision of you standing there
even when we're miles apart
I feel you dancing at my feet

I can't seem to breathe without you close
I need to know that you are here
wrap my arms around you
dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeats

deep into the night we stay
blinded by the lights we sway
love coming from the heat
seeing a kaleidoscope of us in colour
kaleidoscopes are turning me

deep into the night we stay
blinded by the lights we sway
love coming from the heat
seeing a kaleidoscope of us in colour
kaleidoscopes are turning me
