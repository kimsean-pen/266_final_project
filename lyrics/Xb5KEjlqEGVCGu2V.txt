I turned my head up
And the sky was empty
I wasn't looking for paradise
And when I asked for comfort
From the land of plenty
I came to realize

You have taken this for granted
Please don't take it all away

Feel the light of day
Feel it fade away
Walk the line between
The righteous and the wicked
And tomorrow I'll be gone

I thrust my hands in
'Til the nerves went cold
I tasted silver and I tasted gold
And when the bandage lifted
Our scars were newborn
We still felt everything

I have taken this for granted
Please don't take it all away

Feel the light of day
Feel it fade away
Walk the line between
The righteous and the wicked
And tomorrow I'll be gone

Feel the light of day
Feel it fade away
Walk the line between
The righteous and the wicked
And tomorrow I'll be gone
And tomorrow I'll be gone
