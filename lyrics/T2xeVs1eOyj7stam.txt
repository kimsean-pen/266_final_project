Love, don't you worry
Even though it's time to go
While I know you've gotta hurry
Do it slow
I wanna love you once more
Even though we've never loved before

I know so very little about so many things
I know so much about nothing
But our kiss began [?]
There's no one in the world that
I love
And that no one is you

Now I embody
Same song stuck on repeat
Drunk [?] in the lobby
[?] on the beach
I wanna love you again
Even though we've yet to even meet

[?]
[?]
I'm only [?]
[?]

Love's the only lesson everyone knows how to teach
And love's only ever pretending to be out of reach
And nearly next to me

There's no one in the world that
I love
And that no one is you
I can't wait to close my mouth and not
Say a thing
But love's making me sing
