Now, when I was a little boy
At the age of five
I had somethin' in my pocket
Keeps a lot of folks alive

Now I'm a man
Turnin' twenty-one
You know, baby
We can have a lot of fun

I spell M-A-N
Woah, I'm a man

All you pretty women
Standin' in line
I can make a love to you, baby
In an hour's time

I spell M-A-N
Woah, I'm a man

Goin' back down
To Kansas town
To bring back the second cousin
Little Johnny the Conqueroo

I spell M-A-N
Woah, I'm a man

The line I shoot
Will never miss
The way I make love to 'em
They can't resist

I spell M-A-N
Woah, I'm a man

Woah, I'm a man
