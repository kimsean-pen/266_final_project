On the bus, that's where we're riding
On the bus, okay, don't say "hi" then
Your tongue, your transfer
Your hand, your answer

On the bus, everyone's looking forward
On the bus, I am looking forward
And it really ain't okay
I might die before Monday
They're all watching us

Kiss me on the bus
Kiss me on the bus
Oooo, if you knew how I felt now
You wouldn't act so adult now
Hurry hurry, here comes my stop

On the bus, watch our reflection
On the bus, I can't stand no rejection
C'mon let's make a scene
Oh baby don't be so mean
They're all watching us

Kiss me on the bus
Kiss me on the bus
Oooo, if you knew how I felt now
You wouldn't act so adult now
Hurry hurry, here comes my stop

Oooo, if you knew how I felt now
You wouldn't act so adult now
They're all watching us
Kiss me on the bus
Kiss me on the bus
Kiss me on the bus
Kiss me on the bus
