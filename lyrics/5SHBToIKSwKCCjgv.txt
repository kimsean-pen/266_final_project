Hold me
Teach me
Tell me what to do
But I'm not looking for a guide

I can't stand the light
Of the day outside
Feeling so cold inside your shadow

Watch me when I'm falling down
Step aside
Don't ask why
Let me down
Hit the ground
Bet you smile
Deep inside

When I'm lost
And don't know what to do
You run away from me
But you'll never kill the light inside me

Now or never
Can you feel this loss
Please let these memories just fade
Time will heal the rain
But sometimes it hurts
I want to shine outside your halo

Watch me when I'm falling down
Step aside
Don't ask why
Let me down
Hit the ground
Bet you smile
Deep inside

When I'm lost
And don't know what to do
You run away from me
But you'll never kill the light inside me

I don't know what to do
When you run away from me
But you'll never kill the light inside me

I will feel the sun (How far away from me)
Come back upon my face (How far away from me)
The light outside the darkness (How far away from me)
Is not too far away (How far away from me)

Not far away from the nothing
I only want to escape
'Cause you can't kill the light inside of me
Inside myself

I don't know what to do
When you run away from me
But you'll never kill the light inside me

I don't know what to do
When you run away from me
But you'll never kill the light inside me
