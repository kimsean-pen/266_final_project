All you see you don't want to see
but can't seemed to avoid
When you tryin' to be right!
On this stress has life with,
you don't seem to care
And you're making the emotions
to peal away as to why you're here

All that is countless moments
last of countless thoughts
Trying to figure me out,
never seemed to come around
'Til I got to that part of you that's ME

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na

I need more now I want more now
And I'm in Heaven I'm in Heaven now!!
You're so golden I'm so golden now
I want more now I want more now!!

Looked at the moon tonight
I can't get enough
Your hands are so soft to touch
Why can't see
So blind out, blind out

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
(you are so beautiful)
na na na na na
(you are so beautiful)
na na na na na
