What will tomorrow bring,
What will tomorrow bring,
I came to wonder, what will tomorrow bring
I said I wonder, what will tomorrow bring

And joy to my heart and a happiness
And you, darling you, and now

What will tomorrow say, oh what will tomorrow say
I'm thinking of what I'll say, I wonder what I'll say
How are you, how have you been and I, I, I love you and now
it's been so long since you've been in my arms
and over long time since...
So honey tell me, what am I to do

Oh, oh, oh, oh what will tomorrow bring
I think I got the right to know
What will tomorrow bring
I kinda wanna know
What will tomorrow bring
Now, will it bring sadness, a blood, a pain, a shame, a will in...
What will tomorrow bring
I think I got a right to know
tell me, somebody have to tell me
I really wanna know, I really wanna know
I've got to know
