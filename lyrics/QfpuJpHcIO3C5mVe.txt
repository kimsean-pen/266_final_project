When you're feelin' low
Hypodermics where you go
When you're with yourself
Wish you could be someone else

Now can't you see like you saw anymore
Can't you feel like you felt like before
Can't you face anything anymore
When life's a waste

Run away, yea
Your life's a waste
Run away, yea
Run away, yea

Once you get a ride
Doesn't matter where you lied
Once you shoot it in
Doesn't matter who you've been

Now can't you see like you saw anymore
Can't you feel like you felt like before
Can't you face anything anymore
When life's a waste

Run away, yea
Your life's a waste
Run away, yea
Run away, yea

Are you reachin' in?
But you don't know where to begin
All your dance and song
Won't matter when you're gone

Now can't you see like you saw anymore
Can't you feel like you felt like before
Can't you face anything anymore
When life's a waste

Run away, yea
Your life's a waste
Run away, yea
Run away, yea
Run away, yea
Run away, yea

Run away
Yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea
Uhh uhh uhh uhh uhh uhh uhh ohh
Ohh ohh
