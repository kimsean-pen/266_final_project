Witness torment in its purest form
Impossible definition of infinite pain

Look into my eyes
What do you think you see?
What you see is not me
But a dormant stage of what I'm expected to be

Realities lifeline cuts through me
Forever destined to a life of misery
Realities lifeline cuts through me
It manifests my vision conquest

Mourn not the dead
The living suffer
Enter me
Withess torment
