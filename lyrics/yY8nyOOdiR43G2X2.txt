Take a good look at it look at it now
Might be the last time you'll have a go round
I'll let you touch it if you like to go down
I'll let you go further if you take this southern route

Don't go too fast don't go too slow you've got to let your body flow
I like 'em attentive and I like 'em in control
Baby it's yours (all yours) if you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special all through the night

Baby it's yours (all yours) if you want it tonight
Come through my door take off my clothes and turn on the red light
I know that you want me I can see it in your eyes
Ha-ha
You might as well be honest 'cause the body never lies
Tell me your secrets and I'll

I'll tell you mine
I'm feelin' quite sexy and I want you for tonight
If I move too fast (too fast) just let me know
(Just let me know) 'Cause it means you move too slow

I like some excitement and I like a man that goes
Baby it's yours (all yours) if you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special all through the night

Baby it's yours (all yours) if you want it tonight
Come through my door take off my clothes and turn on the red light
If you want me (want me) let me know it

(Let me know)
