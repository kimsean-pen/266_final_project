I'm having trouble breathing
And if I don't think fast, I'm likely to find myself here for good
Panic sets in as I start to question
Why I see you standing there beyond the glass...

(Who said that we never would touch the speed of light?!)

So far behind me, understanding
Stars become rivers flowing backwards (Oh, yea!)
When did my heartbeat start to echo?
Why are my thoughts now fading
Drifting, (Yea!) twisting (Yea!)
Tearing, (Yea!) bleeding (Yea!)

Excuse me, are you a maniac?
I am, and I'm okay with that

One last night (My moon...)
One final kiss (My stars...)
Desire begging me not to go
Goodbye, my everything
I'm terrified (My moon...)
I pull you near (My stars...)
Making sure that you are real
Open my eyes, it was all a dream
Goodbye, my everything

An endless maze, a mobi√ºs labyrinth
Redemption, Exodus, where have you gone?
And yet your gaze will not cease to burn into me!
So far removed, so mockingly you observe
Pariah! Hypocrite! I will be free!
(And yet, you will remain!)

Excuse me, are you a maniac?
I am and I'm okay with that

One last night (My moon...)
One final kiss (My stars...)
Desire begging me not to go
Goodbye, my everything...
I'm terrified (My moon...)
I pull you near (My stars...)
Making sure that you are real
Open my eyes, it was all a dream
Goodbye, my everything...
Goodbye, my everything...

(No!)
Futile screams go unheard!
Incarcerated by so many walls!
(No!)
Imprisoned and banished!
Within a nexus of my own design!

(Please...) Don't go back
(...God...) Don't, don't leave me
(...Kill...) Hide from the world
(...Me!) Let's not exist

Time is mocking me
And now I'm fighting gravity, yea
I'm destroying me
Colliding worlds will set you free
Time is mocking me
And now I'm fighting gravity, yea

A straight line is not the shortest distance between two points!
I know that now, but I'm afraid it might be too late!
I'm afraid it might be too late!
I'm afraid it might be too late!

Will we come back from this?
(Hold my hand, I'm blind!)
Will we come back from this?
(Show me how, I'm lost!)
My God!
(Will we come back from this?)
It's beautiful!
The portal opens, time is slowing
No turning back now, 'Bel!

One last night (My moon...)
One final kiss (My stars...)
Desire begging me not to go
Goodbye, my everything...
I'm terrified (My moon...)
I pull you near (My stars...)
Making sure that you are real
Open my eyes, it was all a dream
Goodbye, my everything...
Goodbye, my everything...

(No!)
Futile screams go unheard!
Incarcerated by so many walls!
(No!)
Imprisoned and banished!
Within a nexus of my own design!
