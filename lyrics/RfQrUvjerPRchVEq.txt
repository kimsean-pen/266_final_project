so pretty, so smart
such a waste of her young heart
what a pity. what a sham
what's the matter with you man?

don't you see it's wrong?
can't you get it right?
out of mind and out of sight
call on all your girls

don't forget the boys
put a lid on all that noise

I'm a satellite heart
lost in the dark
I'm spun out so far
you stop, I start

but I'll be true to you
I hear you're living out of state
running with a whole new scene

you know I haven't slept in weeks
you're the only thing I see

I'm a satellite heart
lost in the dark
I'm spun out so far
you stop, I start
but I'll be true to you
I'm a satellite heart
lost in the dark
I'm spun out so far
you stop, I start
but I'll be true to you
no matter what you do
yeah, I'll be true to you
