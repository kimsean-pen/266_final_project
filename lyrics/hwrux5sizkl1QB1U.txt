Oh, when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kinda hectic inside
Mmm, baby I'm so into you
Darling, if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
So deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Fantasy
Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
So deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
So deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Fantasy
I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend
My laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning
And there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming
But I'm not sleeping
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
So deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Fantasy
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
So deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Fantasy
Sweet, sweet fantasy baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy baby
