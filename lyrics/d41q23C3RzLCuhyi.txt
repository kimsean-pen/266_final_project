And I don't know where you went when you left me but
It says here in the water, you must be gone by now
I can tell somehow
One hand on the trigger of the telephone
Wondering when the call comes, Will you say it's all right
You've got your heart right

Maybe I'll sleep inside my coat and
Wait on your porch 'til you come back home
Oh, right
I can't find a flight

We share the sadness
split screen sadness

Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight

"All you need is love" is a lie, 'cause
We had love but we still said goodbye
Now we're tired battle fighters

And it stings when it's nobody's fault
Cause there's nothin' to blame at the drop of your name
It's only the air you took and the breath you left

Maybe I'll sleep inside my coat and
Wait on your porch 'til you come back home
Oh, right
I can't find a flight
So I'll check the weather wherever you are
Cause I wanna know if you can see the stars tonight
It might be my only right

We share the sadness
split screen sadness
We share the sadness
Split screen sadness

I called
Because
I just
Need to feel you on the line
Don't hang up this time
And I know it was me who called it over but
I still wish you'd fought me 'til your dying day
Don't let me get away

Cause I can't wait to figure out what's wrong with me
So I can say, "This is the way that I used to be"
There's no substitute for time
Or for the sadness
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
split screen sadness
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
We share the sadness
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
split screen sadness
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Oh and the sadness it's alright, it's alright
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Oh and the sadness it's alright, it's alright
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Oh and the sadness it's alright, it's alright
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Oh and the sadness it's alright, it's alright
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
