This box is lovely that I made
You may open up whenever you're lonely
You know, there's nowhere left to go:
You magnify the evidence
It correlates the angles
I'm staring in the wrong direction

Well take back
When it's time for relief it's so...
It's so hard reading you...

When she's heretic
My body is a wage
I am burning in
Wake up for this wish
And I resignate
I have seen my fate
I am sinking
Oh, captain I am sinking

Well take back
When it's time for relief it's so...
It's so hard reading you...
For if I leave your empty smile

Explode into four
And on the last I will
For our eyes, one by one

While everybody else could be fighting out
For all this, for all this
Well everybody else could be fighting
For all this, hope for all this, hope for

Secrets and irises open the door
To a pride of lions and murder of crows
No one knows how I begin
But how I'll end...

You're focused in the reason why
I'm far beneath the answer
You're acting like a separation

Well take back
When it's time for relief it's so...
It's so hard reading you...
For if I leave your empty smile
Explode into four and on the last I will
For our eyes, one by one
