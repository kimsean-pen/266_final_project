I travel
All around the city
Go in and out of
Locomotives
All alone

There's no-one here
And people everywhere
Crying 'cause I need you
Crying I can feel you
Crying 'cause I need you
Crying 'cause I care.

It's a hot day
And I'm dressed likely
I move carefully
Through the crowd
Here everyone
Are so vulnerable
And I'm as well

There's no-one here
And people everywhere
Crying 'cause I need you
Crying I can feel you
Crying 'cause I need you
Crying 'cause I care

Only if a ship would sail in
Or just someone came
And knocked at my door
Or just, or just something
Crying 'cause I need you
Crying I can feel you
Crying 'cause I need you
Crying 'cause I care
