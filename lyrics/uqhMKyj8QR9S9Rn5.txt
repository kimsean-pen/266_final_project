I let too much in
And the souls begin
We were so much alive I couldn't win
I had life pursuing sin
And life pursuing wind
And we were forcing dreams
I can hear, but I cannot see
I'll never be free
I'll try, but I'll never be free
Always plagued by what I can never be

Alone, the dreams of hopes and wasted goals
Sources and forces of the wasted lie
They slip
The pursuit of time, just wasting more
Pious and bias like light shining down on me
And I was lost for me
And I was tied to me
I'll never be free
I try, but I'll never be free

It's instrumental on the face of dawn
Nothing to gain
The middle is gone
I would wait for things to die
So hard, so hard we tried
I tried so hard
Haven't figured anything out
Left behind, so much pain
So much doubt
Leave worlds behind
I'll never be free
Always plagued by what I'll never be
