Somewhere between happy
And total fucking wreck
Feet sometimes on solid ground
Sometimes at the edge
To spend your waking moments
Simply killing time
Is to give up on your hopes and dreams

Life for you has been less than kind
So take a number, stand in line
We've all been sorry, we've all been hurt
But how we survive

A deep nod in agreement
A status quo exile

Life for you has been less than kind
So take a number, stand in line
We've all been sorry, we've all been hurt
But how we survive
Is what makes us who we are

All smiles and sunshine
A perfect world on a perfect day
Everything always works out
I have never felt so fucking great

A perfect world on a perfect day
Everything always works out
I have never felt so great

Or fucking up our...

Life for you has been less than kind
So take a number, stand in line
We've all been sorry, we've all been hurt
But how we survive
Is what makes us who we are
That's what makes us who we are
What makes us who we are
That's what makes us who we are
