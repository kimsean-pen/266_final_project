The moment I wake up
Before I put on my make up (make up)
I say a little prayer for you
While combing my hair now
And wondering what dress to wear now (wear now)
I say a little prayer for you

Forever (forever) and ever (ever)
You'll stay in my heart
And I'll love you
Forever (forever) and ever (ever)
We never will part
Oh how I'll love you
Together (together), together (together)
That's how it will be
Without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

I run for the bus dear
While riding it I think of us dear (us dear)
And I say a little prayer for you, for you
At work I just take time (just take time)
And all through my coffee break time (break time)
I say a little prayer for you, prayer for you

Forever (forever) and ever (ever)
You'll stay in my heart
And I'll love you
Forever (forever) and ever (ever)
We never will part
Oh how I'll love you
Together (together), together (together)
That's how it will be
Without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me, for me

Forever (forever) and ever (ever)
You'll stay in my heart
And I'll love you
Forever and ever (ever)
We never will part
Oh how I'll love you (how I'll love)
Together (yeah), together (together)
That's how it will be
To live without you (without you)
Would only mean heartbreak for me

My darling believe me
For me there is no one
But you
Please love me too
I'm in love with you
Answer my prayer (Answer my prayer)
Answer my prayer (Answer my prayer)
Say you love me too
Answer my prayer
Answer my prayer now
Answer my prayer
I'm so in love with you
Answer my prayer
Answer my prayer now

Forever (forever) and ever (ever)
You'll stay in my heart
And I'll love you
Forever (forever) and ever (ever)
We never will part
Oh how I'll love you
Together (together), together (together)
That's how it will be
Without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

Forever (forever) and ever (ever)
You'll stay in my heart
And I'll love you
Forever (ouh) and ever (ever)
We never will part
Oh how I'll love you
Together (together), together (together)
That's how it will be
Without you
