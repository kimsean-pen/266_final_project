The better then to know myself
That fear be damned and love be wealth
To sing it like a mountain stream
To dance like no one sees
That blinked an eye, that flashed a smile
But missed it by a country mile
Now sleek to dive in mirrored pools
And dance like no one sees

So seize the day, yeah aim it true
We'll live the way that lovers do
We'll go defenseless, open wide
We'll let the senses be our guide
We'll break the surface, snip these strings
Relearn the grace of selfless things
We'll dance like no one sees
Dance like no one sees
We'll dance like no one sees

And sleek to dive in mirrored pools
So sleek to dive in mirrored pools
In mirrored pools, so sleek to dive
And kiss the face, yeah snip these strings
Relearn the grace of selfless things
Then sleek to dive
(Tonight we dance like no one sees us)
And sleek to dive
(Tonight we dance like no one sees us)
(Tonight we dance like no one sees)
