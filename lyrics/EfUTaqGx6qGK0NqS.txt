Oh God, I think I'm dying
And our drinks were just bought
Look outside, someone's waiting
With a yellow horse

With a hole in the heart I was forced to ride in morning traffic
With a golden hand by your fortress side but without magic
Somebody, somebody, somebody tell me it won't be long
'Cause a horse is not a home
A horse is not a home

Uninvited to the play
Where language doesn't hurt
With nothing on my shirt
Sometimes I swim with you
In a room that is ocean-sized and clear not here
Where all I breathe is smoke

With a hole in the heart I was forced to ride in morning traffic
With a golden hand by your fortress side but without magic
Somebody, somebody, somebody tell me it won't be long
'Cause a horse is not a home
A horse is not a home

Somebody, somebody, somebody tell me it won't be long
'Cause a horse is not a home
A horse is not a home
