When you were young and your heart
was an open book
You used to say live and let live
(You know you did)
(You know you did)
(You know you did)
But if this ever changing world
In which we're living
Makes you give in and cry

Say Live and Let Die
(Live and Let Die)
Live and Let Die

(Live and Let Die)

What does it matter to ya
When you've got a job to
do you gotta do it well
You gotta give the other fellow hell

You used to say live and let live
(You know you did)
(You know you did)
(You know you did)
But if this ever changing world
In which we're living
Makes you give in and cry
Say Live and Let Die
(Live and Let Die)
Live and Let Die
(Live and Let Die)
