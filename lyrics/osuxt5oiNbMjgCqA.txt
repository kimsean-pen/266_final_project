Well, I know it's just a spring haze
But I don't much like the look of it
And if omens are a godsend like men breezing in
Certain these clouds go somewhere
Billowing out to somewhere
In a single engine Cessna
You say we'll never make it there
So all we do is circle it
Uh oh, let go, off on my way

Unseen this eternal wanting
Let go, way to go, so I get creamed
Waiting on Sunday to drown
Uh oh, waiting on, waiting on Sunday
Waiting on Sunday to land, hey
Uh oh, waiting on, waiting on Sunday
Waiting on Sunday to drown
Well, I know it's just a spring haze

But I don't much like the look of it
And all we do is circle it
And I found out where my edge is
And it bleeds into where you resist
And my only way way out is to go so far in
Billowing out to somewhere
Billowing out Luna Riviera
Billowing out to somewhere
Let go, uh oh, off on my way
Unseen this eternal wanting

Let go, way to go, so I get creamed
Waiting on Sunday to drown
Waiting on Sunday to drown
Why does it always end up like this?
Why does it always end up like this?

Why does it always end up like this?
Why does it always end, always end
Let go, uh oh, off on my way

Unseen this eternal wanting
Let go, way to go, so I get creamed
Waiting on Sunday to drown
Let go! Waiting on, waiting on someday
Waiting on Sunday to land, hey
Uh oh, waiting on, waiting on Sunday
Waiting on Sunday to...
Waiting on Sunday to drown
Waiting on Sunday...
Waiting on Sunday to land
Uh oh, so if I really get creamed
I'm waiting on Sunday to...
drown
