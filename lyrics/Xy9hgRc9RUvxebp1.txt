I think I'll come over
I'll give you my number
You lover, supporter
Then give me a mother
You come take me home and
Take me to your doctor
You think you'll come over?

I think I'm a mother

Roll over, roll over
And roll me a man-a
You lover, my lover
You just roll me over
You give me a mother
A man if I love her
I love her, I'll keep her
I better just keep her

Come on and support her
I said to the mother
She said you come over
She said she'd supporter her
I love her, I kept her
And then she just left and
Alone, I emplore ya

I think I'm a mother
(what is she saying after this?)
