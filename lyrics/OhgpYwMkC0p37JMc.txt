Oh Lordy Lordy, oh Lordy
Well, your head hangs below the ground
Oh Lordy Lordy, oh Lordy
Well, I think that's where you were found

And so they tell me that you ain't my friend
I'm a loss to yourself, I'll assure you again
When you cry me some real tears, I'll be on the run
You come near me now girl, I'll go get me a gun

I've never been to prison, I don't know why
I stared death down in it's chambers, baby, eye to eye
If prison is a cell, then it's raging in my blood
This is a song from the heart, ain't...
Ain't nothin' else
