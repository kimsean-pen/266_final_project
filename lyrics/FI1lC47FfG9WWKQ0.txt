Deities and saviors mistaken for creators
False stories and bullshit lies fabricated a globe of
mindless manikins connected to strings, controlled by deceit
A brainwashed humanity falls to its
knees serving to please what can not be seen

Molded into mindless fools
Breeding new life into a cycle of shit
Force-fed false hope and piled into the cesspool of ignorance
When will they see the almighty has yet to be seen?

Drown in the cesspool of ignorance
Choke on the uncertainty
The unease eats away at your mind just like the rest of society
You're not fooling anybody

A brainwashed humanity falls to its
knees serving to please what can not be seen
Eradication of all idols

Eradication of the almighty idols who do not show themselves
All the oblivion must be put to an end
Just wake the fuck up and realize that there is nothing
beyond the realm of this dark earth that you always have suffered in
We are left alone to question our existence

We're left all alone in this bleak existence
