I let it go and watched it fly,
So far away out of my sight.
I trusted in your eagle eye.
I let it go. I let it go.
I dug a hole into the ground.
I hid my chest, it won't be found.
I took a breath without a sound.
I let it go. I let it go.
Is this the start or end?
I've been told a thousand times it's good for me (good for me),
But I don't believe it.
I'm being warned by everyone that I meet (that I meet),
That I've set my world on fire.
Right now.
What it all comes down to.
I need to see it in your eyes (I need to see it in your eyes),
And never doubt it.
I need to know (Can you believe in something?).
I've been told a thousand times it's good for me (good for me),
But I don't believe it.
I'm being warned by everyone that I meet (that I meet),
That I've set my world on fire.
