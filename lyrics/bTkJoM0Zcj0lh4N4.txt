this is a special shot going out to my mama, ms. ernestine charles.
mama used to do people hair in the kitchen,
press and curl, hot curlers, everything,
i love you mama

black hair is a revolution
cornrows... uh, uh honey, i am tender-headed
jheri curls... style sophistication
afro puff... ah ooh ah, ah ooh ah
hair weave... call her miss ross
braids... pride, respect
extensions... more of a 90's fashion
asymmetrical shroom... banji girl

i'm going back, back, back to my roots
where my love can be found and my heart rings true
i'm going back, back, back to my roots
to the time and the place, coming back to you

black hair is a revolution
finger wave... a classic extravaganza
press and curl... never mix, never worry
flat top fade... very contemporary
nail sculpture... urban distinction
hot comb... ouch mama, that was my ear
blow out kits... oh, oh tamba
no lye relaxer... fried dyed and laid to the side

i'm going back, back, back to my roots
where my love can be found and my heart rings true
i'm going back, back, back to my roots
to the time and the place, coming back to you

now mama got her own salon down on auburn ave,
and if you wanna know what's happening in atlanta
just go to the salon, that's to you and all y'all down there,
brothers and sisters, miss earlene, lizzy dean, renetta,
little baby boy, tone tone, leo-nard, k-ron, cornisha
peace to all my brothers and sisters,
peace, love and hair grease
