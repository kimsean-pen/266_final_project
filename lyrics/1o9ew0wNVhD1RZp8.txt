I'm from a different type of left land
Old wild West land
Nose bleeds, palm trees and tumbleweeds wrestlin'
Outside they say it's happy here but it's depressin'
Too many pretty faces catchin' my attention
So I look 'em
Remind myself in this smudge glass
That pretty isn't everything, you punkass

Always hard to see past the surface when it looks so perfect
But her eyes will disguise dirt on purpose
You listening?
I grew up here, under the sun
In grade school, I was the odd one out of the bunch
And I don't mean I was the kid to eat bugs for lunch
I was the one who wasn't comin' from where they're comin' from
Uh

I speak poetically and never pride my ignorance
But this California shit is rigorous
So they say it's happy here
Happiness is figurative
I'm happy cause of me, doesn't matter where I'm livin'

If the sun was God, I'd be covered in faith
If the ocean was the devil, I'd be covered in hate

I'm so West Coast, it's a goddamn shame
I'm so West Coast, it's a goddamn shame

I'm waking up underneath sheets, naked, still sweating
Slept in late so everybody else is ready
My friend called up, he said "hurry up, buddy, It's almost sundown already"
So I hopped up
I went and washed up
I ate some pasta
Then I gave my Mom hugs

And then I thought, uuh
It's gonna be a pretty nice night
(But pretty isn't everything, right?)

Golden state mind
I'm taking my time
Plain white shirt and a skinny black tie
My top let down when I get picked up
PCH, so California

Maybe they were right
Happiness is a warm gun
But before you shoot please, warn us
Life is too fun
California will you marry me?
Let God be the sun and in the ocean they shall bury me

If the sun was God, I'd be covered in faith
If the ocean was the devil, I'd be covered in hate

I'm so West Coast, it's a goddamn shame
I'm so West Coast, it's a goddamn shame
I'm so West Coast, it's a goddamn shame
I'm so West Coast, it's a goddamn shame
