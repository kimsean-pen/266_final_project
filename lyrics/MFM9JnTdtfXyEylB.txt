Don't give me that look, that let me down easy smile
Don't act like I couldn't see you coming for a hundred miles
Don't try to find the perfect words
Can't take the pain out of the hurt
Hit me hard, baby I can take it
It's your move, go on and make it
Make it burn the whole way down
Lay my six foot four inch ass out on the ground
Yeah, tomorrow I'll have me a hard hangover
And one hell of a heartache
So pour it on like a shot of whiskey
And shoot me straight
I've got some friends who'd love to go raise some hell
A couple old flames to help me bid you farewell
There's plenty of time and alcohol
From happy hour, to last call
So do what you gotta do
So I can get to getting over you
And make it burn the whole way down
Lay my six foot four inch ass out on the ground
Yeah, tomorrow I'll have me a hard hangover
And one hell of a heartache
So pour it on like a shot of whiskey
And shoot me straight
Don't give me that salt shaker and lime
Don't give me that come back chaser this time
Don't muddle it up, don't water it down
Give me everything you got right here, right now
Make it burn

Make it burn the whole way down
Lay my six foot four inch ass out on the ground
Yeah, tomorrow I'll have me a hard hangover
And one hell of a heartache
Pour it on like a shot of whiskey
And shoot me straight
Shoot me straight, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on now
