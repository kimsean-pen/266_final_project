Small fish stuck in a fish bowl
Will you run for the sea?
Watching life all around you
Are you looking at me?

Swim around in a circle
Come along when it's feeding time
You're the king of the castle
Who likes to hide
But when you find the ocean
How will you know where to go?

When I see you tomorrow
Will you remember this song?
