Caught up in the waves
The death of the day
Sing like sirens in shadows
As blue turns to grey
In youth and decay
Turning oceans to shallows

Lying lonely
One is only
Only one
Dying slowly
One is only
Only one

Like smoke on the mirror
Under the pier
Some say it doesn't matter
Crystal is clear
Closer than near
As we climb Jacob's ladder

Lying lonely
One is only
Only one
Dying slowly
One is only
Only one

Lying lonely
One is only
Only one
Dying slowly
One is only
Only one
