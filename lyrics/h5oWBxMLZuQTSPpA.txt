Hallo, it's nice to meet you
I've been waiting years up in the blue
Can I come out to play now
This could be the start of something good

So let's start a paranoid affair
'Cause love is overrated
So a paranoid affair
Is all that we can think of

Hallo boy, I need you
Have you been waiting in the blue?
Come out, come out let's play now
This could be the end of something new

So let's start a paranoid affair
'Cause love is overrated
So a paranoid affair
Is all that we can think of

There's trouble in the pines
Whenever we are passing through
There's trouble in the atmosphere between me and you
Every time we try to make this world a better place
The shadows in the pines make us lost

So let's start a paranoid affair
A paranoid affair
'Cause love is overrated
So a paranoid affair
'Cause love is overrated
So a paranoid affair
Is all that we can think of
