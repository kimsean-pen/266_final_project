These thoughts of you are all I have to pull me through
This fight my heart is strong and true
There's nothing I won't do to show you
I would sacrifice my dying breath for you

No matter how dark the road
You'll light my way
No matter how far my home
I'll find my way

The bridge is burning and there's no returning
To the desert songs of yesterday
These streets are cracked and all the trees have died
But I will not lose faith I will not stray

No matter how dark the road
You'll light my way
No matter how far my home
I'll find my way
