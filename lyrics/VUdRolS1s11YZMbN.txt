I've only shut their brains
In their dark homes
More than i see is more
That can't or shouldn't see
Whats living past?
And all demons that can end all
Next phase through
Transform
Grab on
Hang hell
When you were not there
You will beg
You beg and spit blood

Are we capable of all that is thine?

And preach
Over ruled, dislodge your lives

I am in strength aaahhhh
A poorer dark devil in mustard gas

A blind deadly grime
Abides deplorably in hell
The animals bone, unchained
Old bread

Who has man brought up as its god?

Those with hell stink like fools
We're fine
Glory is thine

Burnt back, I spit blood
The unmentionable circle
Running darkness burns

I am
Burnt eyes
And dark hooves
Hells that break all loyal
Burn back
The hour draws, judgment
No pain, nowhere, my luck was struck down

Lucifer, certainly leaves us all
Hung, come too far
Now we turn to everlasting fire
Where?
Listen up
All for black
