Oh, the river, oh, the river, it's running free
& all joy, all the joy it brings to me
But I know it'll have to drown me
Before it can breathe easy

& I've seen it in the flights of birds
I've seen it in you
The entrails of the animals
The blood's running through

But in order to get to the heart
I think sometimes you have to cut through
But you can
You can
You can

Just keep following the heartlines on your hand
Just keep following the heartlines on your hand
Keep it up, I know you can
Just keep following the heartlines on your hand
'Cause I am

Odyssey on odyssey & land over land
Creepin' & a-crawlin' like the sea over sand
Still I follow heartlines on your hand
This fantasy, this fallacy, this tumbling stone
Echoes of a city that's long overgrown
Your heart is the only place that I call home
Can I be returned?
You can
I know you can
Just keep following the heartlines on your hand

Just keep following the heartlines on your hand
Keep it up, I know you can
Just keep following the heartlines on your hand
What a thing to do

Oh, whoa, oh
What a thing to choose
But no, in some way I'm there with you
Up against the wall on a Wednesday afternoon
Just keep following the heartlines on your hand
Keep it up, I know you can
Just keep following the heartlines on your hand
'Cause I am
