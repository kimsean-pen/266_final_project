There is a point of no return
It's easy to see
You're slipping away from me

Where is the part that's alien?
It's trippin' the mains, I think
It's trippin' the mains, I think

I got a voltage that's running high
I can barely close my eyes
It's giving me away, I think

Oh, I've got a fever that's running hot
And I know I'm missing you a lot
I'm giving it away, I think

There is a point of no return
It's easy to see
You're slipping away from me

I got a voltage that's running high
And I can barely close my eyes
It's giving me the way, I think

Oh, I've got a fever that's running hot
And I know I'm missing you a lot
I'm giving it away, I think

Oh, I got a voltage that's running high
And I can barely close my eyes
It's giving me away, I think

Oh, I've got a fever that's running hot
And I know I'm missing you a lot
I'm giving it away, I think

Oh, I got a voltage that's running high
And I can barely close my eyes
It's giving me away, I think

Oh, I've got a fever that's running hot
And I know I'm missing you a lot
I'm giving it away, I think
