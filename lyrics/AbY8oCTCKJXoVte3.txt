Tell me why we must go sleep
Tell me why the one things we can't keep
Tell me why, we have no choice
Tell me why these illusions have a voice

Oh oh oh oh all that I've got to give
Oh oh oh oh it's all for you
Oh oh oh oh all that I need to live
Oh oh oh oh it's all for you

Think about my love
All of my possessions
Everything I own, it's all for you
The end of my days
When they all thought it was over
I wanna say

It's all for you... It's all for you... It's all for you...
It's all for you... It's all for you... It's all for you...
It's all for you... It's all for you... It's all for you...
It's all for you... It's all for you... It's all for you...

I don't know why you live to dream
I don't know why we crave things we don't need
I don't know why we live to die
I don't know why we're never dreaming satisfied

Oh oh oh oh all that I've got to give
Oh oh oh oh it's all for you
Oh oh oh oh all that I need to live
Oh oh oh oh it's all for you

Think about my love
All of my possessions
Everything I own, it's all for you
The end of my days
When they all thought it was over
I wanna say

It's all for you... It's all for you... It's all for you...
It's all for you... It's all for you... It's all for you...
It's all for you... It's all for you... It's all for you...
It's all for you... It's all for you... It's all for you...

Everything I own, it's all for you

Think about my love
All of my possessions
Everything I own, it's all for you
The end of my days
When they all thought it was over
I wanna say

It's all for you... It's all for you... It's all for you...
It's all for you... It's all for you... It's all for you...
It's all for you... It's all for you... It's all for you...
It's all for you... It's all for you... It's all for you...

It's all for you... It's all for you... It's all for you... (everything I own)
It's all for you... It's all for you... It's all for you...
(Everything I own)
