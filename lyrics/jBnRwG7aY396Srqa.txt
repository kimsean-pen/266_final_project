You love me, you hate me, would you please decide
We've fed hatred through the things we didn't say
I guess honesty sometimes really breaks things up
I love you, I hate you and I can't decide
What feels better when darkness has devoured light
But I fail to believe this is also you
When it's black!
When all you see and do is black
This raging part of you breaks me down
A blinded hate marked within your soul

Black or white
Love or fight
Hate can taint our brightest memory
Black or white
Anguished pride

What if all stayed the same
Was that better?
Black and white turned to grey
Is that better?
We hurt the ones we love the most
What if we turned the tide
Will it matter?
What if we left out pride
Would that better withered hope and mourn the love that's turned black

When you're okay, you're smiling and you're doing fine
You can charm and lure, make me remember why
But that could be a facade to get what you need
When you're not fine, you're raging, your face like a mask
Eyes filled with fire seem to burn me down
As a dark opponent to your smiles

And I'm scared!
In fear and rage I turn away
I've seen too much of this to know your games
I've had too much
I have to let you go
Goodbye

Black or white
While love died
No in between or grey for you
Black or white
All tears dried
What face will you put up this time?

What if all stayed the same
Was that better?
Black and white turned to grey
Is that better?
We hurt the ones we love the most
What if we turned the tide
Will it matter?
What if we left out pride
Would that better withered hope and mourn the love that's turned black

Black or white
While love died

What if all stayed the same
Was that better?
Black and white turned to grey
Is that better?
We hurt the ones we love the most
What if we turned the tide
Will it matter?
What if we left out pride
Would that better withered hope and mourn the love that's turned black
