Found a way to stay out of the doubt
Found someone to keep you satisfied
It's a bony shelter
They think you could feel better
Just don't look into those eyes

'Cause when your cold heart answers

You don't want it to stop
Don't want it to stop
Until you
Believe their comments

You don't want it to stop

Don't want it to stop

You always liked the kisses taste like wine

In the way, you're hidden side by side
It's a bony shelter

Writing your love letters

They make you feel so strange inside

You're such a long time

I wanted to believe my own lie
Lover don't doubt
I wanna show the world what we've found
'Cause when your cold heart answers

You don't want it to stop
Don't want it to stop
Unless you
Believe their comments
You don't want it to stop
Don't want it to stop
Until
When your cold heart answers
You don't want it to stop
Don't want it to stop
Unless you
Believe their comments
You don't want it to stop
Don't want it to stop
