Well you're so pretty, baby,
I'd do anything for free.
Well you're so pretty, baby,
Woo woo
I'd do anything for free.

Cuz she's got the kinda good looks sugar,
Sink their hooks inside o' me.
And I know...

That you're the girl I'd marry,
If you'd only take my hand.
Well you're the girl I'd marry,
Woo woo
If you'd only take my hand.

Well I know you're only thirteen honey,
But I hoped you'd understand,
Cuz I know...

If I show up on your doorstep,
With a gold ring in my hand.
If I show up on your doorstep,
Woo woo
With a gold ring in my hand.

Nobody tries to tell me nothin',
Don't they know I understand?

And it takes more than your money, honey,
Woo-oo
To make a man.
