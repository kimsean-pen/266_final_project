Sugar never tasted so good, sugar never tasted so good,
Sugar never tasted good to me, yeah.

Until her eyes crossed over, until her mind crossed over,
Until her soul fell next to me...

Now, if the wrinkle that is in your brain has given you quite a sting,
Your fingers have become a crane pulling on these puppet strings.

Yeah...

What a feeling that's begun, what a feeling that's begun.
What a feeling that's begun, what a feeling that's begun.

All right...

I felt just like a baby until I held a baby,
What a fool this boy can be, yeah...

And her thoughts like a daisy, how my mind gets lazy,
I must've been crazy not to see.

All right...
If the wrinkle that is in your brain has given you quite a sting,
Your fingers have become a crane, your fingers have become a crane,
Your fingers have become a crane pulling on these puppet strings.

Water never tasted so good, water never tasted so good,
Water never tasted good to me.
