I wanna start by letting you know this
Because of you my life has a purpose
You helped me be who I am today
I see myself in every word you say
Sometimes it feels like nobody gets me trapped in a world
Where everyone hates me
There's so much that I'm going through
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you

I was broken
I was choking
I was lost
This song saved my life
I was bleeding
Stopped believing
Could have died
This song saved my life
I was down
I was drowning
But it came on just in time

This song saved my life

Sometimes I feel like you've known me forever
You always know how to make me feel better
Because of you my dad and me
Are so much closer than we used to be
You're my scape when I'm stuck in this small town
I turn you up whenever I feel down

You let me know like no one else
That it's ok to be myself

I was broken
I was choking
I was lost
This song saved my life
I was bleeding
Stopped believing
Could have died
This song saved my life
I was down

I was drowning
But it came on just in time
This song saved my life

You'll never know what it means to me
That I'm not alone, that I'll never have to be

I was broken
I was chocking
I was lost
This song saved my life
I was bleeding
Stopped believing
Could have died
This song saved my life
I was down
I was drowning
But it came on just in time
This song saved my life
My life, my life
This song saved my life
My life, my life
This song saved my life
My life, my life
This song saved my life
My life, my live
This song saved my life
