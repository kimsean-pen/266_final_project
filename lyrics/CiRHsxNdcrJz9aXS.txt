You might think I'm coming to the brink
I guess we'll see, if I'll keep it all together now

Don't think you got, got the upper hand
'Cause I got no time for lines drawn in the sand

I'll bring it on
I'll bring it on, bring it on, yeah
Oh, here it comes
So bring it on, bring it on

Trouble ahead, it's getting dangerous
It's never far off and dance away the way I like it

Pray that these down don't do its needs
Grab his horns now and make him say please
Make him say please

I'll bring it on
I'll bring it on, bring it on
Oh, here it comes
So bring it on, bring it on

I don't care where you went or where you're going
Because I'm gonna show where you'll belong
Don't matter how fast you're running, you can't still me, coming
You can't still me, coming

I'll bring it on
I'll bring it on, bring it on
Oh, here it comes
So bring it on, bring it on
