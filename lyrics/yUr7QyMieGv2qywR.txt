Inside the night, there's a firelight
Between the worlds
At the edge of dark
Inside the fire there's a blinding light
The flame that burns
Between the worlds
At the edge of the dark

When a shadow is forced into the light
It rips through your chest and burns like a fire
When a shadow is forced into the light
And the blood of the serpents will burst under brightest stars

And the wings will carry these shadow and the light
And the scars like diamonds will cut through the veil of night

The clouds apart and new stars alight
Between the worlds
In the sea of the sky
The sun and moon shines from your eyes
Lead me home through the map of skies
From the edge of the night

When a shadow (Shadow) is forced into the light
It rips through your chest and burns like a fire
When a shadow (Shadow) is forced into the light
And the blood of the serpents will burst under brightest stars

And the wings will carry these shadow and the light
And the scars like diamonds will cut through the veil of night
At the edge of the dark (Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark)
At the heart of the dark (Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark)
At the edge of the dark

Where I stare night straight in the eye
And the demons of deep will arrive
From the wounds they bleed out their black blood like oil
And I spark the flame of the night
And I will melt these chains
And forge them as a crown
Drag those shadows to the light

From the heart of the dark (Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark)
At the edge of the dark (Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark)
From the edge

When a shadow (Shadow) is forced into the light
It rips through your chest and burns like a fire
When a shadow (Shadow) is forced into the light
And the blood of the serpents will burst under brightest stars
