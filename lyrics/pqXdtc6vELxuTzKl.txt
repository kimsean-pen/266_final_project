keep on searching
keep on running
suicide eyes
just keep hunting
for new hearts to break
for old wounds to make
no one will break your fall
keep on moving
keep on hiding
in ripe new lives
you are destroying
finding comfort
in their wreckage
you kill new hope
with old pain
no one will break your fall
