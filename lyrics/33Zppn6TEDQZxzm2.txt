I'm flying down the fast lane
Doing ninety-five, ninety things on my brain
Don't know where the hell I'm going, but I'm going after you
I'm jumping on the last train
Got this crazy kind of feeling that I can't explain

Don't know where the hell I'm going, but I'm going after you
And I know you think I'm crazy, and I dress up like I'm four
I don't do dinner and movies, but if I showed up at your door
Would you, give me one more minute?

The story's far from finished we could, fill in all the pages
I'm feeling sick! Girl, you're so contagious
Just wanna say I miss you
I caught it when I kissed you and I've, been through all the stages

I'm feeling sick! Girl, you're so contagious!
(I-I-I-I'm feeling sick! Girl, you're so contagious!)
It was raining on Wednesday
Doing ninety-five, ninety things left to say
Told myself to keep on driving, 'Cause I left my heart with you
I never thought that I could walk away
Every second, I'm regretting that I didn't stay
How can I just keep on driving, when I left my heart with you?
You think all my friends are crazy, and I know you hate my car
Well, I don't drive a Mercedes, would it be that hard
To just, give me one more minute
The story's far from finished we could, fill in all pages

I'm feeling sick! Girl, you're so contagious!
Just wanna say I miss you
I caught it when I kissed you and I've, been through all the stages
I'm feeling sick! Girl, you're so contagious!
(I-I-I-I'm feeling sick! Girl, you're so contagious!)

How can I get a second chance?
Don't want you slippin' out my hands
Maybe the words would come out right this time around (Does this sound contagious?)
Just hear me out before I go

Things that I wanted you to know
Just let me in tonight and I won't let you go
(Does this sound contagious?)
Would you give me one more minute?
