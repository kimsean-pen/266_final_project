I never believed in things I couldn't see
I said if I can't feel it then how can it be
No, no magic could happen to me
And then I saw you

I couldn't believe it, you took my heart
I couldn't retrieve it, said to myself
What's it all about
Now I know there can be no doubt

You can do magic
You can have anything that you desire
Magic, and you know
You're the one who can put out the fire

You know darn well
When you cast your spell you will get your way
When you hypnotize with your eyes
A heart of stone can turn to clay

Doo, doo, doo it...
Doo, doo, doo...
Doo, doo, doo it...
Doo, doo, doo it...

And when the rain is beatin'
Upon the window pane
And when the night it gets so cold
When I can't sleep

Again you come to me
I hold you tight, the rain disappears
Who would believe it
With a word you dry my tears

You can do magic
You can have anything that you desire
Magic, and you know
You're the one who can put out the fire

You know darn well
When you cast your spell you will get your way
When you hypnotize with your eyes
A heart of stone can turn to clay

Doo, doo, doo it...
Doo, doo, doo do...
And If I wanted to
I could never be free

I never believed it was true
But now it's so clear to me
You can do magic
You can have anything that you desire

Magic, and you know
You're the one who can put out the fire
You know darn well
When you cast your spell you will get your way

When you hypnotize with your eyes
A heart of stone can turn to clay
Doo, doo, doo it...
Doo, doo, doo do...

Doo, doo, doo it...
(You're the one who can put out the fire)
Doo, doo, doo it...
(You're the one who can put out the fire)
All right

You can do it
Thank you very much, you can do magic girl
