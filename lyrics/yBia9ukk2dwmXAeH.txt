What is it about you?
Why are you so strange?

I love your music
Wait, do you play in a band?
Yeah, I-I totally saw you
You kind of remind me of um, you know that umm, umm
Umm, umm ueehhh ueeEH EEEHH

Oh what's wrong with you?
Are you annoyed?
(Oh my god)
What are we gonna do?
Where are we gonna go?
(Where are we going after)

Hey, are you doing a DJ set tonight?
Oh, I see (No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)

Man, I think she's faking her accent
I mean, nobody talks like that
(If living life the right way means keeping some sort of control over your emotions, I'm out. Oh yeah. Marie Davidson, what a bitch)

So, frankly, is this album about taking risks?
(She doesn't even know what she wants)

Oh hi, what's up? (Oh, that guy is actually gay)
I'm sorry I missed your set, I heard it was amazing

Do you have drugs?
Can I help you roll your cables?

Do you know what's happening?
Are you coming?
Who are you anyways?
Please come with me, please please come we're going nowhere

'Cause she's fucked

Do you really need to carry around all that gear with you?
My god! (Can you hear my heart beating? Nah, nah, nah)

Are you insane? (Oh, can you hear my ego talking?)
Does that bother you?

Who are you? Mm? Tell me
'Cause I wanna know
Who the fuck are you?

(If you see me in the morning
And it seems like I'm about to cry
It probably means that I've lost it
It's not easy to stay sober
It's not easy to stay sober
No it's not
Don't judge me for my mistakes
No words could explain
How deep is the pain)
