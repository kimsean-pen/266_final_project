If only I had truthfully seen
That night we'll never re-live
But you and I could not go and walk away
Just close your eyes
You'll never see me crashing down
I see where we had come in doubt
I'd be lonely if you weren't so proud

I have seen so many loving faces
They turn back and leave with looks of regret
The road goes and I am finding home in it

But you and I should not play those games
The world is coming to an end
It's just the way I see my face
And I can never believe
(Now I can see it)
Now I see where things are turning 'round
And I'd be lonely if you weren't so proud

I have seen so many loving faces
They turn back and leave with looks of regret
The road goes and I am finding home in it
The road goes and I am finding home in it

I saw him fly
He's never looked this way
I saw in his eyes
He's never coming down

I have seen so many loving faces
They turn back and leave with looks of regret
The road goes and I am finding home in it
The road goes and I am finding home in it
The road goes and I am finding home in it
(And now you're finally home)
And I am finding home
(And now we're finally home)
And I am finding home in it
