I never felt so high
I never felt so high
I never felt so high
I think I'm coming down
I never laughed so loud
I never laughed so loud
I never laughed so loud
I think I'm coming down
Nothing gonna stop me now
Nothing gonna stop me now
Nothing gonna stop me now
Please
Please don't leave
Easy feeling
Don't leave me like that
Not yet
Don't set me
Free, free, free, free, free
I never felt so high
I never felt so high
I never felt so high
I never laughed so loud
I never laughed so loud
I never laughed so loud
Nothing gonna stop me now
Nothing gonna stop me now
Nothing gonna stop me now
