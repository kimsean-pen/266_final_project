All the modern things
Like cars and such
Have always existed
They've just been waiting in a mountain
For the right moment
Listening to the irritating noises
Of dinosaurs and people
Dabbling outside

Tahiiiiiii
Engin fylgist alveg medh
Tahiiiiiii
S'olin sekkur
Tahiiiiiii
Engin s'er vidh m'er
Thad er s'ol thegar hann
Andar inn 'i m'er
Hann b'itur mig
Hann b'itur mig
J'a, hann kemur medh
Fylgir eftir m'er
Telur?? medh
Siglir eftir m'er

All the modern things
Have always existed
They've just been waiting
To come out
And multiply
And take over
It's their turn now...
