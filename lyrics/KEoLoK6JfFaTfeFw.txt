I feel like I'm
Gonna go insane
'Cause I keep hearing
Your voice call my name
In an empty room girl
You're the one I see
Let me tell you
Girl we're history

I'm a one man show
(One man show)
I don't need no one
(Need no one)
I'll be fine alone
(Fine alone)
Oh yeah
You can call me but
(Call me but)
I won't pick up my phone
(Up my phone)
'Cause I'm a one man show
(One man show)
Oh yeah

I don't need you girl

Girl, you broke my heart
And let me down
I'd be better off
If you weren't around
Took my love and
Through it on the ground

Saying goodbye girl
Don't make a sound

I'm a one man show
(One man show)
I don't need no one
(Need no one)
I'll be fine alone
(Fine alone)
Oh yeah
You can call me but
(Call me but)
I won't pick up my phone
(Up my phone)
'Cause I'm a one man show

(One man show)
Oh yeah
I don't need you girl

I was so blind
Now I finally see

Everything you did to me
And I thought it might change
And we could find a place
We'd be happy too

I'm a one man show
I don't need no one
I'll be fine alone
(Fine alone)
Oh yeah
You can call me but
(Call me but)

I won't pick up my phone
(Up my phone)
'Cause I'm a one man show
(One man show)
Oh yeah, yeah

I'm a one man show
(One man show)
I don't need no one
(Need no one)
I'll be fine alone
(Fine alone)
Oh yeah
You can call me but
(Call me but)
I won't pick up my phone
(Up my phone)
'Cause I'm a one man show
(One man show)
Oh yeah
I don't need you girl
(Yeah!)
