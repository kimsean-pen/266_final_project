It's the boy you never told I like you
It's the girl you let get away
It's the one you saw that day on the train
But you freaked out and walked away

It's the plane you wanna catch to Vegas
Things you swear you'll do before you die
It's the city of love that waits for you
But you're too damn scared to fly

Hit the lights, let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight, come alive
Let the moment take you, lose control tonight

Hit the lights, let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight, come alive
Let the moment take you, lose control tonight

It's the time that you totally screwed up
Still you're trying get it out your brain
It's the fight you had when you didn't make up
It's the past that you're dying to change

It's all the money the you're saving
While the good life passes by
It's all the dreams that never came true
'Cause you're too damn scared to try

Hit the lights, let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight, come alive
Let the moment take you, lose control tonight

Hit the lights, let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight, come alive
Let the moment take you, lose control tonight

It's a mad, mad world, gotta make an escape
It's a perfect world, when you go all the way
Hit the lights, let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight

So let's go, go, go, go
All the way, yeah let's go, go, go
Night and day, from the floor to the rafters
People raise your glasses
We could dance forever

Hit the lights, let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight, come alive
Let the moment take you, lose control tonight

It's a mad, mad world, gotta make an escape
It's a perfect world, when you go all the way
Hit the lights, let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight
