If I should see you in the sky
I will look up, I will look up with some delight
I'll probably ask you shit you've heard a million times
How many parts of things I do would you consider crime?
I'll ask you which way I should go
Even if you answer I won't trust you with my soul
I'm only human, I watch stories on TV
They give me an ending when an ending's all I need

You don't know how much I love this
You don't know how much I love this

So many lines I've had to cross
Don't wanna belong to a club with such a leniant boss
Get your ass down here, reprimand me for my sins
How can I know reason if no reason's why I've been
How come every man ain't good
And if it happened overnight would you retire if you could?
I belive in heaven, I deny myself a death
Dying keep me concious of the way I waste my breath

You don't know how much I love this
You don't know how much I love this
You don't know how much I love this
You don't know how much I love this

So you'll tell me how it is
But what if how it is does not agree with how I live?
Should I admit the path I'm on is not the best
Should I join your super highway cause you say that it's correct?
Just want an answer I can trust
Things I should be doing ain't the same as things I should
Tony Soprano is a teacher I respect
He's always been there when I take a nasty step

You don't know how much I love this
You don't know how much I love this
You don't know how much I love this
You don't know how much I love this

So I don't think we should confer
Let's just grab a cup of coffee, get fairtrade if you prefer
You'll look at me ways that I've never looked at you
And I'll step back still wondering what you're thinking I should do

You don't know how much I love this
You don't know how much I love this
You don't know how much I love this
You don't know how much I love this
