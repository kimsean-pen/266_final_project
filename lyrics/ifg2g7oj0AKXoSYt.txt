Me and my friends
We've been friends for a long time
When we were younger, we threw parties
Now we're older, we still do
Some of us are getting married
Some of us are having babies
Some of us are turning baddy
A lot of us are all dead
Growing older is not as scary
As I always thought it would be
Just because you're not as pretty
Doesn't mean you're not happy
I was at a bar in Utah
A younger girl, she shoved into me
She had a very trendy haircut
Bittersweet symphony
Growing older is not as scary
As I always thought it would be
Just because you're not as pretty
Doesn't mean you're not happy
Doesn't mean you're not happy
Doesn't mean you're not happy
Doesn't mean you're not happy
Doesn't mean you're not happy
