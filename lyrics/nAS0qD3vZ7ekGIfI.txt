Your pets are gonna die...
Your pets are gonna die...
Your pets, are gonna die...

Gonna die...
Your pets, are gonna die...
Gonna die...
Your pets, are gonna die...

But it's not the end
The end of ends

Your pets are gonna die...
Your pets are gonna die...
Your pets, are gonna die...

Let's hear it for the time of the end
The time they give to time it's end
Let this be the time of the end
Standing between time and its end
The word is come, the time of the end
Your pets will give the time of the end
To call upon the time of the end
The word is come, the time of the end
