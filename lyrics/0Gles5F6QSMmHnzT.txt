start the play ---

synthesize me
make me your love and hate machine
and i can serve you better
start the true
emotion scheme
till i'm no longer forced
to keep my vital functions

synthesize me
and reboot
i need to start again
i need to make it different
all unguarded
all without
the will to play along
benumb its futile feelers

synthesize me
wash away
the trash i'm piling up
to mesmerize the moments
i'll drop the needle
my settings work
no stunted interactions
no doubts no paranoia

i'm half-alive
my skin is intact
i'm only staring at the blade

i'm half-alive
my skin is intact
i'm only staring at the blade
