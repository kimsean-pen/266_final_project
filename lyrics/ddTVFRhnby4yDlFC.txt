I just got your message
baby
so sad to see you fade away.
What in the world is this feeling to catch a breath
and leave me reeling?
It'll get you in the end
it's God's revenge.
Oh
I know I should come clean
but I prefer to deceive.
Everyday I walk alone and I pray that God won't see me.
I know it's wrong.
I know it's wrong.
Tell me why is it' I'm digging your scene

I know I'll die
baby.

They put you in a home to fill in

but I wouldn't call that living.
I'm like a boy among men
I'd like a permanent friend.
I'd like to think that I was just myself again.
Tell me why is it I'm digging your scene

I know I'll die
baby.

Oh

baby - oh
come on
baby - oh
come on
