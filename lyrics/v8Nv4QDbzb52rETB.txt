Gary, now I know I was wrong
I messed up, and now you're gone

Gary, I'm sorry I neglected you
Oh, I never expected you to run away and leave me
Feeling this empty
Your meow right now would sound like music to me
Please come home, 'cause I miss you, Gary

(Gary come home...)
Gary come home
(Gary come home...)

Gary, can't you see I was blind
I'll do anything to change your mind

More than a pet, you're my best friend
Too cool to forget, come back
'Cause we are family
And forgive me for making you wanna roam

And now my heart is beating like the saddest metronome
Somewhere I hope you're reading my latest three-word
poem: Gary come home

(Gary come home...)
Gary come home
(Gary come home...)
Gary come home
(Gary come home...)
Gary come home
(Gary come home)
Ahh...
Gary, come home
Gary, come home
Gary, won't you come home
Please, won't you come home
