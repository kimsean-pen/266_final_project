Sick and tired, and you wanna see a change
But you don't wanna change for me
Be so kind to explain what's on your mind
Your the riddle of the century
I'm afraid there was a lion lying in the shade
On a hammock, hanging from my tree

Lazy lies today (lazy lies today)
Lazy lies today (lazy lies today)
Tomorrow you might change
But it's lazy lies today (lazy lies today)
Lazy lies today (lazy lies today)
Tomorrow you might change
But lazy lies today

Please explain what you think there is to gain
When you treat me like a magazine
Just a picture, I'm a temporary fixture
Like a moment in your make believe
My prediction, strange as fiction
I'll get over this addiction too

Lazy lies today (lazy lies today)
Lazy lies today (lazy lies today)
Tomorrow you might change
But it's lazy lies today (lazy lies today)
Lazy lies today (lazy lies today)
Lazy lies today (lazy lies today)
Tomorrow you might change
But it's lazy lies today

(Lazy lies today, lazy lies today)
(Lazy lies today, lazy lies today)
(Lazy lies today, lazy lies today)
(Lazy lies today, lazy lies today)
