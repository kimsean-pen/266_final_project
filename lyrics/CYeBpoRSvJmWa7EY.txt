Are the walls getting closer,
As I'm getting closer to you?
And are we falling faster,
Now we have further to fall?
I know sometimes I act like I don't care,
About you.
I know I'm a lucky girl.

And the thought of you leaving,
Gets heavier every day.
And my mind is deceiving,
What is it that I'm believing?
I know sometimes I act like I don't care,
About you.
