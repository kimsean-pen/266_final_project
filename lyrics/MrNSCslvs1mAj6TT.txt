I seem to sink lower
Gazing in the rays of the solar
In fact we made a pact but now i think its over
I'm red and wired but he sipped on KA soda
Fuck, that's coca-cola
As TV sports the Olympic Ebola
I think we might be bipolar
I think she thinks i'm bipolar
He left the crime scene without the Motorola
Still had dreams of being young Franco Zola
For at least for now its all over
Yeah at least for now its all over

I seem to sink lower
In biscuit town
In biscuit town

Your shallow waters i'm the deep sea bed and i'm the reason you flow
I got more moons wrapped around my head and Jupiter knows
Whilst you orbit with some stupider hoes
Only a slacker would know
Tryna get up in group home
Tryna eat from the same bowl
And my troop is abode (she's like)
I seem to sink lower
In biscuit town
In biscuit town

I seem to sink lower
In biscuit town
In biscuit town
In biscuit town

And now i'm caught off by the taste in her mouth
She whispers all about
She got a mystery man deep down south
And no more wheelers, dealers creeping about
At least none that she knows
From the way so much
'Til I'm rolled up in the same old dutch
Need a touch forth of my libido
And now she steadily hitting speed cones
As we proceed to a street dome
In the body not a weak bone
A strong mind but she still got a side for a people
Not that she knows
That's what he knows
In biscuit town
I seem to sink lower
In biscuit town
In biscuit town
In biscuit town
In biscuit town
In biscuit town
In biscuit town
In biscuit town
