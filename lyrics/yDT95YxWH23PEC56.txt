Turn away, turn away from the wall
Turn away, turn away from the wall
Face me now, Face me now
Show me, show me all your tears
Your pain, your pain makes me burn

It's my shame
It's my shame we both hurt
We both hurt

I've got to strip this flesh from my bones
I've got to hammer this wall with my hands
With my hands

And I saw you
I saw you shine
I was holding you

I saw your face. I saw our face as you heard my words
my words
And you left me. You left me to hold yourself

And I've got to strip this flesh from my bones
I've got to hammer this wall with my hands
with my hands

The lights have all gone out
The lights have all gone out
But I saw you
I saw you shine
