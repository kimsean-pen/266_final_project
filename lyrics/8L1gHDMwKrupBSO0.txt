He sees them both everyday now.
He watched the story unfold.
In the grass underneath the trees, inside a red SUV,
Two silhouettes and no second guessing.

"Is someone tryna to test me?" he thought to himself.
"Once upon a time I was an innocent little kid
And I felt like I knew everything, now everything's against me."

Just raise your guard and say "keep your heart".
You can't get burned if you put out the spark.
I feel I just can't win, let myself down again.
Just raise your guard and say "keep your heart".

Those five weeks felt like forever.
He waited this whole time to see her again.
Of course wouldn't you know (this happened two summers ago),
She showed up with her cool new boyfriend... (motherf*cker)

It's starting to annoy him. He thought to himself...
"Once upon a time I was an innocent little kid
And I felt like I knew everything, now everything's against me."

Just raise your guard and say "keep your heart".
You can't get burned if you put out the spark.
I feel I just can't win, let myself down again.
Just raise your guard and say "keep your heart".

So I'd set it straight... she never know
If we die today you had me at hello
That's why I loved you
I know I throw that word around
But I mean it, I swear I f*cking mean it

And you're gone, and you're gone
Safe keep your heart...
And I can't win... I can't win...

You need your space again,
It's not the right time or place again,
You lied right to my face again
In your basement, we were wasted.
I always try to talk at the worst times,
You dated many boys, I'm the worst kind.
Every word I write it's the worst line
So if I hurt her feelings, she hurt mine.

(And I can't win... I can't win...)
Raise your guard, safe-keep your heart.
You can't get burned if you put out the spark.
