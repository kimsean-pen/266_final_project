Come and look out the window
Rocky road, silver cloud
Why did you ever wonder?
How could you ever doubt me I can't work it out?

Don't you know that I love you?
Don't you know that I care?
Winter gone, snow is melting
You are here, you are mine, you are spring in the air

Don't you know that I love you?
Don't you know how I feel?
I will stand next to you love
Through the sun, through the rain
Let me say it again
Don't you know that I love you?
