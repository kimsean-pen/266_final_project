Today
I smoked my pain away
Yesterday we stood
In our decadent decay
We braved the storm
But still not did conform

We serve the virgin
Of suffering
We serve the virgin
And not the king

Within the darkness
We came along
We drove the devil
Into his perverted religious throne

We serve the virgin
Of suffering
We serve the virgin
And not the king

Disconnection system takes control
I will serve the virgin and not the whore
If you take a step back to realize
This disconnection system shall open your eyes
