I don't care where the innocent go
Que sera sera
I don't care where the north wind blows
I'll just float along

I won't take amazing grace
I just need someone to lead me

Through the shadows
Weeping willows
Gather at
The gallows

I see truth in lies we spoke
I will pray alone

I won't take amazing grace
I just need someone to lead me

Through the shadows
Weeping willows
Gather at
The gallows

Lovers underneath the weeping willow
Just lovers underneath the weeping willow
We're lovers underneath the weeping willow
Lovers underneath the weeping willow

Through the shadows
Weeping willows
Gather at
The gallows

Through the shadows
Weeping willows
Gather at
The gallows
