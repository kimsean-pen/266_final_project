How's it goingExplain?
Where I want it
She's someone I can't have
I'm pleased to get you now
I'm only built to show

Even though I was the cause
Even though I need you bad
Even though that time is lost
I know we can't be made up

You?, an item, a situation
Your voice coming through the light
You're not exactly by my side
It's all a plan, and I know it can sound made up
Tell me where we are, I don't want to beat myself up

My favor, two over, don't see my days tonight
Plus you didn't even let me know
I'm not going till we got two shows

How's it going?
Where I want it
She's someone I can't have
I'm pleased to get you now
I'm only built to show

Even though I was the cause
Even though I made you cry
Even though that time is lost
I know we can't be made up

My favor, two over, don't see my days tonight
Plus you didn't even let me know
I'm not going till we got three shows
