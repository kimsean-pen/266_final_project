(Do do da, do do da
Do do da, do do...)

My thoughts are slowly coming out loud
I flinch each time I hear them out loud
Guess I know what its like now,
to be honest,
To see what I'm hiding in the closet
Do I still look the same to you now,
Am I still clean enough?

(Do do da, do do da...)

Breathe slowly, sink in
Considerate eyes
Deep sleep while I
tip the bottle back
Guess we've seen what it's like now
to be lovers
Scream that we're nothing
Without each other
Can I lay back and close my eyes
and pretend you're mine

(Do do da, do do da...)

Have we made a fool of us
Have we taken all the good away
If I'm not supposed to be alone
Then I'm begging you to stay
here

I saw your face
in the mirror last night.
That stained your clothes
back Sunday it eyes
Guess you've heard what I'm like now
Just a body
You're haunting our bedroom
and the hallway
And I still hear your voice in my head
Saying awful things
