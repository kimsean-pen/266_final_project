I was sold up the river to the red slave trade
The stores were gathered, the plans were laid
Synchronised watches at 18: 05
How many dead or alive
In 1955

The pink flags was screaming
Bugle boys sucked and blew
No time for confessions, orders given
Books were cooked, on the 4th of the 3rd
How many seen or heard
On the 12th of the 3rd

How many dead or alive
