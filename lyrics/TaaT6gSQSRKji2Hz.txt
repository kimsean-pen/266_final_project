up to my neck in strife
up to my neck in misery
for most of my life i've been a fool
and you know what a fool can do

you came around when I needed you
now I'm up to my neck in you

up to my neck in pleasure
up to my neck in pain
up to my neck on a railroad track
waitin' for the trains to come on through
oh, you knew my time was due

you came around and you pulled me through
now I'm up to my neck in you

up to my neck in whiskey
up to my neck in wine
up to my neck in wishing
that this life wasn't mine
what can I do
oh, what can I do

you did what no one else would do
now I'm up to my neck in you
