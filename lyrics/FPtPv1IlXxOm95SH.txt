Y-O-U-R-E-G-O-R-G-E-O-U-S

Remember that tanktop you bought me
You wrote "you're gorgeous" on it
You took me to your rented motorcar
And filmed me on the bonnet

You got me to hitch my knees up
And pulled my legs apart
You took an instamatic camera
And pulled my sleeves around my heart

Because you're gorgeous
I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous
I know you'll get me through

You said my clothes were sexy
You tore away my shirt
You rubbed an ice cube on my chest
Snapped me 'til it hurt

Because you're gorgeous
I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous
I know you'll get me through

Ah ah
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Ha ha ha!

You said I wasn't cheap
You paid me 20 pounds
You promised to put me in a magazine
On every table in every lounge

Because you're gorgeous
I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous
I know you'll get me through

Because you're gorgeous
I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous
I know you'll get me, know you'll get me through

Know you'll get me through
Know you'll get me through
Know you'll get me, know you'll get me through
I know you'll get me, know you'll get me
Know you'll get me through

Because you're gorgeous
I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous
I know you'll get me through
Because you're gorgeous
I'd do anything gor you

Because you're gorgeous
I know you'll get me, know you'll get me through
Know you'll get me through
