Can you feel the pain?
See the mess and trouble in your brain
Anger you retain
Pressure rocks you like a hurricane
Is it time for
You to jump into the next train?
Change of hand, make a stand
I can see your heart change

Wake up
No more nap, your turn is coming up
You feel lazy but
Stop the fantasies and bubble butts
If you need to hear
Go for it!
I will teach you how to feel the things
So close to you, connect it all

(Act like a brother)
Every day is a miracle
(Help one another)
Connect back with the people
(Give it to your lover)
And all the people you miss
(Let's come around)

(Act like a brother)
Don't think you're invisible
(Help one another)
Connect back with the people
(Give it to your lover)
And all the people you miss
(Let's come around)

Would you show your head?
Would you text me from your rest bed?
Running from the dead
In the battle of cyber-heads
You should think twice
'Cause they will make your brain melt
New device, better price
Keep you feeling impressed

Stop it all, every day we live a miracle
Unpredictable
You don't need an upgrade anymore
Can't you see the link?
Don't worry
I will teach you how to take the pill
To feel the thrill and touch it all

(Act like a brother)
Every day is a miracle
(Help one another)
Connect back with the people
(Give it to your lover)
And all the people you miss
(Let's come around)

(Act like a brother)
Don't think you're invisible
(Help one another)
Connect back with the people
(Give it to your lover)
And all the people you miss
(Let's come around)

(Act like a brother)
Every day is a miracle
(Help one another)
Connect back with the people
(Give it to your lover)
And all the people you miss
(Let's come around)

(Act like a brother)
Don't think you're invisible
(Help one another)
Connect back with the people
(Give it to your lover)
And all the people you miss
(Let's come around)
