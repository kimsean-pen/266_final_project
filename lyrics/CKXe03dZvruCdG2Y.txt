Tell me your destination
Could need some inspiration
Don't make too much of it
Now let's not analyse

This is the game with no rules
I wont commit to I do
All I can say for sure is
What will be, will be

In tears of joy and a lack of sorrow
lack of sorrow
I live my life the way I planned

I am not a sinner, nor a saint
Not that I will loose my head and faint
Every time we tuch, no
am I forgiven living and loving my way

I am not a sinner, nor a saint
You never gonna break my heart I ain't
Gonna let it happen no
Am i forgiven
Confessions are made in the name of myself

Am I a bad boy maybe
Am I a sad boy let see
I can't remember crying since I was a child

Don't need no babysitter (Aaa)
No I am not that bitter (Aaa)
I get my satisfaction every now and then

In tears of joy and a lack of sorrow
lack of sorrow
I live my life the way I planned

I am not a sinner, nor a saint
Not that I will loose my head and faint
Every time we touch, no
Am I forgiven living and loving in my way

I am not a sinner, nor a saint
You never gonna break my heart I ain't
Gonna let it happen, no
Am I forgiven
Confessions are made in the name of myself

Aaaaa Not that I will loose my head and faint
Every time we tuch, no
Am I forgiven
living and loving in my way

I am not a sinner, nor a saint
You never gonna break my heart I ain't
Gonna let it happen, no
Am I forgiven
Confessions are made in the name
of myself
