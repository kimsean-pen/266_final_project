Yeah smash on the radio
Bet I penned it

Britney, (break me off, OHHHH) Toy soldier
Britney, (break me off, OHHHH) Toy soldier
Britney, (break me off, OHHHH) Toy soldier
Britney, (break me off, OHHHH) Toy soldier

I'm out the door, its automatic,
simple babe (why you wanna do that to me)
I'm like a fire,
bottle bustin in your face (why you wanna do that to me)
So tired of you bein up in my space, (what you gonna do with that)
How much more can I take
I'm tired of privates drivin, need a general that ain't weak

When I shut the door leaving with my bag
Hit the scene in my new wagon
Bet he gon wish he knew the type of fun im gettin into
Peek a boo, he good
Doin' things you wish you could
He's not talkin, hes just walkin'
Like them city boys from New York

This time I need a soldier
A really badass soldier
That knows how to take, take care of me
I'm so damn glad that's over
This time I need a soldier
I'm sick of toy soldiers
A boy that knows how to take care of me
Won't be just comin' over

I don't want no more (toy soldiers)
I'm simply sick and tired of those toy soldiers
I don't want no more (toy soldiers)
I'm simply sick and tired of those toy soldiers

I want it more than ever now
Realized that they ain't listenin'
Like a princess supposed to get it
That's why im dusting of my feet
Coming back looking delicious
Yes I know they wanna kiss it
Now I hold em at attention
'Cause new Britney's on a mission

When I shut the door leaving with my bag
Hit the scene in my new wagon
Bet he gon wish he knew the type of fun im gettin into
Peek a boo, he good
Doin' things you wish you could
He's not talkin, hes just walkin'
Like them city boys from New York

This time I need a soldier
A really badass soldier
That knows how to take, take care of me
I'm so damn glad that's over
This time I need a soldier
I'm sick of toy soldiers
A boy that knows how to take care of me
Won't be just comin' over

(Brit) I heard that he was saying he's still in love with you and
(Brit) I heard he said he could stay if he wanted to
(Brit) I heard that every man out here is wantin you now
(Brit) I heard, I heard, what you gonna do now?

This time I need a soldier
A really badass soldier
That knows how to take, take care of me
I'm so damn glad that's over
This time I need a soldier
I'm sick of toy soldiers
A boy that knows how to take care of me
Won't be just comin' over

I need
I'm so sick of toy soldier
A boy that knows how to take care of me
Won't be just coming over

Comin ova
Comin ova

I need
I'm so sick of toy soldier
A boy that knows how to take care of me
Won't be just coming ova
