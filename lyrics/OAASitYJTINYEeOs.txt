Into the fire on my own, hey
I know I won't see your face again, hey
Are you sitting there alone? Hey-ey

Are you thinking like me
of the laughing times
of all the sad and loving times?
Everything that's left of us is fading away

Promise me to think of us as a time so beautiful
Promise me to think of us – still bright, still colourful
Promise me to look back at us as a time in your life you enjoyed

Surrounded by flames everywhere
What I used to be, I'm not even there
The absence of you is killing me, hey-ey.

Are you thinking like me
of the laughing times
of all the sad and loving times?
Everything that's left of us is fading away

Promise me to think of us as a time so beautiful
Promise me to think of us – still bright, still colourful
Promise me to look back at us as a time in your life you enjoyed

Promise me, promise me.
I will be fine without you.
Promise me, promise me.
Once more in my life to see you.
Promise me, promise me.
I will be fine without you.
Promise me, promise me.
Once more in my life to see you.
(Can you promise me?)
...to see you
(Can you promise me?)
Promise me to think of us as a time so beautiful ...so beautiful
Promise me to think of us – still bright, still colourful ...still colourful
Promise me to look back at us as a time in your life you enjoyed
Promise me to think of us as a time so beautiful ... so beautiful
Promise me to think of us – still bright, still colourful ...still colourful
Promise me to look back at us as a time in your life you enjoyed
