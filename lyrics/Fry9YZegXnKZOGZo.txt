The sun falls on my eyes and I'm struggling to reason why
everybody smiles
Am I the only one who feels this way at all
Is someone too proud to let it go
And I'm swallowing my feet and choking on everything I feel
The sun falls on my eyes and I'm struggling to reason why
everybody smiles
Am I the only one who feels this way at all
Is someone too proud to let it go
And I'm swallowing my feet and choking on all these words
I spoke too much, I spoke too much
Please try, who did you change to help yourself grow up
and that's why all these words mean nothing to you at all
Please try, wouldn't you change to keep yourself alive to fly
and words like these won't help me now
Save yourself and I'm sorry if I told you how I felt and you
couldn't take it
If you change or stay the same, I'm sorry if I told you how I
felt and you couldn't take it
But I see her standing there just smiling and I know that for a
little while I'll be fine
