Into the fire
Black skies filled with smoke
Darker horizons ahead
Out of the pan and into the fire
The descent into madness

Brightest day
Darkest night
The inferno

Into the fire
Black skies filled with smoke
Darker horizons ahead (that's right)
Out of the pan and into the fire
The descent into madness

Brightest day
Darkest night
The inferno

Burn down to the madness, madness
Leave your mind at the door

Madness, madness
Madness, madness
