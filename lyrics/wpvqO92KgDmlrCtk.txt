Baby we should last forever
And hold all the plans we have made
But baby what lasts forever?
We've noticed that something has changed

Rainbow party, rainbow clock
I lost my hope and my hope lost my heart
Rainbow party, rainbow clock
I can't handle it, can't breathe, that's all

Your lips still tremble as I try to find the key
That opened our real paradise and left us here, locked outside

We lose our minds when we
Think it's not possible to win
But when we take control
We realize it gets better

Rainbow, clock
