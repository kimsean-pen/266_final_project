I looked back to the one and only summertime
When my girl was the envy of every friend of mine
She slept safely in my arms
We were so young and invincible

Closed lips
She was never one to kiss and tell
Those trips in the summer never went so well
Young love was such dumb love
Call it what you want
It was still enough

And it's still out of my reach
And you're still
All of the things that I want in my life
How could I ask you to leave me?
And we were just kids in love
The summer was full of mistakes
We wouldn't learn from
The first kiss stole the breath from my lips
Why did the last one tear us apart?

Our breath smelled of cigarettes and alcohol
We walked down the beach, counting every star
Hearts beat inside out chest
Leaving us gasping for every breath

Her smile with the wind blowing through her hair
Was so contagious in the air
So satisfying
And I'm still smiling

And it's still out of my reach
And you're still
All of the things that I want in my life
How could I ask you to leave me?
And we were just kids in love
The summer was full of mistakes
We wouldn't learn from
The first kiss stole the breath from my lips
Why did the last one tear us apart?

We're falling down
(Can we pick up the pieces?)
We're at an all-time low
(How do we get it back?)
We're falling down
(Can we pick up the pieces?)
We're at an all-time low
(How do we get it back?)

We're falling down
(Can we pick up the pieces now?)
'Cause we were just kids in love
The summer was full of mistakes
We wouldn't learn from
The first kiss stole the breath from my lips
Why did the last one tear us
We were just kids in love
The summer was full of mistakes
We wouldn't learn from
The first kiss stole the breath from my lips
Why did the last one tear us apart?
The first kiss stole the breath from my lips
Why did the last one tear us apart?
