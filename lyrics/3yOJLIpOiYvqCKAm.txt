Don't stop me from fallin'
'Cause I don't wanna play pretend
'Cause I just wanna let you in the world I'm in
'Cause I like the way that you're movin'

Don't stop me from dreamin'
You're playin' with fire and I can't hold back
'Cause I like the way that you're movin'

Hopeful romantic, I don't ever wanna be alone
It's automatic 'cause you know I'm gonna lose control
I'm in the static, I'm an addict and you've got to know
Hopeful romantic, hopeful romantic

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

I'm caught up in you and I don't know what else to do
'Cause I'm under attack and I got it bad for you
Come bother me, come bother me
'Cause I'm beggin' for mercy and down on my knees

Oh, oh, oh, hopeful romantic, I don't ever wanna be alone
It's automatic 'cause you know I'm gonna lose control
I'm in the static, I'm an addict and you've got to know
Hopeful romantic, hopeful romantic

You wanna get in the way, I want you to
If you've got nothing to say, I'll take abuse
'Cause I've got a fever tonight
You got me down on my knees
You got me down on my knees

Hopeful romantic, I don't ever wanna be alone
It's automatic 'cause you know I'm gonna lose control
I'm in the static, I'm an addict and you've got to know
Hopeful romantic, hopeful romantic

Oh, oh, oh, oh, you got me down on my knees
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hopeful romantic
And I don't know what else to do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hopeful romantic

I'm in the static, I'm an addict and you've got to know
Hopeful romantic, hopeful romantic
