Yes I like stormy weather
From my window sill
But you ain't yeah you ain't so clever
You've got it all made up

But it feels
Like love, love love

Yes and it feels
Like touch, touch touch

I sit around to pass the time
I try to get it off of my mind
But the little world is oh so small
that I can't get around the sober

But it feels
Like love, love love

Yes and it feels
Like touch, touch touch

What did I say?
What did I say?
What did I say?
Oh, I didn't mean it

What did I do?
Oh to hurt you?
I didn't mean it
Oh, I didn't mean it

I'm not saying it's all made up
There's people there to comb your hair
But I'll seek out
Another song
Wont kill that so beautiful

But it feels
Like love, love love

Yes and it feels
Like touch, touch touch

What did I say?
What did I say?
What did I say?
Oh, I didn't mean it

What did I do?
Oh to hurt you?
What did I do?
I didn't mean it
Oh, I didn't mean it

And it feels
Like love, love love

Yes and it feels
Like touch, touch touch

Yes and it feels
Like love, love love

Yes and it feels
Like touch, touch touch
