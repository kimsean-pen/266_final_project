All aboard
Hit the road
All the bullshit
Can't be ignored
It's hard to place
In my face
No emotion

All the problems make me wanna go
Like a bad girl straight to video
Little darling welcome to the show
You're a failure played in stereo

Here we go
No solution

Strong undertoe
Quite unfair
Quite a pair
No boxoffice

All the problems make me wanna go
Like a bad girl straight to video

Little darling welcome to the show
You're a failure played in stereo
