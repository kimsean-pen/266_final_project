I never know the reasons why
When all is said and done
Give me the answers and show me the way
But you know I'm not the one

When I look into your eyes
You say you're holding on
But when I turn around I find your love is gone
Gone away
Take your love away
Take your love away

Summer breeze and the autumn winds
You know they bring the rainy days
I never know the reason why
You take your love away

When I look into your eyes
You say you're holding on
But when I turn around
I find your love is gone
Gone away
Take your love away
Take your love away

Now we dream of all the changes
and the changes dreams can bring
But all you want in your fantasy
Is a little wedding ring

When I look into your eyes
You say you're holding on
But when I turn around
I find your love is gone
Gone away
Take your love away
Take your love away

When I look into your eyes
You say you're holding on
But when I turn around
I find your love is gone
Gone away
Take your love away
Take your love away
