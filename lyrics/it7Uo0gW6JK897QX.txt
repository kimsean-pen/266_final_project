I'm pouring my heart out,
Leaving almost nothing for myself,
You're beginning my eyes
Why do I feel your mind is somewhere else?
Our love is delicate as butterfly wings,
But still we fight about the silliest things,
I hate it when we do,
So I'll keep forgiving you,
Over and over again.

And we're flying on paper planes,
Hoping it don't rain on my parade,
When I'm with you it's strange,
I'll make it everything,
Hoping that the wind don't change,
Oh oh oh oh...

It's danger when you fall out,
I never learned to walk before I run,
It's too easy to fall out
I'll push away the clouds to see the sun,
Oh oh oh,
As beautiful as a song a nightingale sings,
It's nothing compared to the joy you bring,
This river that love is,
I tried swimming,
And I went over my head.

'Cause we're flying on paper planes,
Hoping it don't rain on my parade,
When I'm with you it's strange,
I'll make last all day,
Hoping that the wind don't change,
Oh oh oh oh...

I'm scared to fall
'Cause we're so high,
And it's a long way down from here,
But if we're strong, if we try,
We can touch the sky.

And we're flying on paper planes
Hoping it don't rain on my parade,
When I'm with you it's strange,
I'll make it everything
I hope your wind don't change
Oh oh oh oh...
