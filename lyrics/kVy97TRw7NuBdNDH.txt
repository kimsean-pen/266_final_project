You promise me our love would last forever
You stand by me to make our dreams come true
And now you say we can carry on together
The chemistry is gone for me and you

But I believe we still belong together
And all the dreams we make can still come true
If we can only try to make it better
We give our love a chance to make it true
I wonder why

Why can't we give each other our love
Unconditional true love
Look inside us for the light in our soul
Why can't we heal each others heart
Never let us fall apart
Look inside us for the light in our soul
The light in our soul
The light in our soul

I said that we were meant to be together
I haven't lost my faith in me and you
If we could only try and make it better
Give our love a chance to make it true
I wonder why

Why can't we give each other our love
Unconditional true love
Look inside us for the light in our soul
Why can't we heal each others heart
Never let us fall apart
Look inside us for the light in our soul
The light in our soul

Why can't we give each other our love
Unconditional true love
Look inside us for the light in our soul
Why can't we heal each others heart
Never let us fall apart
Look inside us for the light in our soul
The light in our soul
The light in our soul
The light in our soul

The light in our soul
