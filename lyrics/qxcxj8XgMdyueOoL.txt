Good God, don't jump
The boy sat on the ledge
An old man who had fainted was revived (He's all right)
And everyone agreed t'would be a miracle indeed if the boy survived

"Save the life of my child"
Cried the desperate mother

A woman from the supermarket ran to call the cops
"He must be high on something", someone said
Though it never made the New York Times
In the Daily News the caption read

"Save the life of my child"
Cried the desperate mother

(Hello, darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again)

A patrol car passing by halted to a stop
Said Officer McDougall in dismay
"The force can't do a decent job
'Cause the kid's got no respect for the law today"
(And blah, blah, blah)

"Save the life of my child"
Cried the desperate mother
"Oh, what's become of the children?"
People asking each other

When darkness fell, excitement kissed the crowd and it made them wild
In the atmosphere of freaky holiday
When the spotlight hit the boy and the crowd began to cheer
He flew away

Oh, my grace, I've got no hidin' place
Oh, my grace, I've got no hidin' place
Oh, my grace, I've got no hidin' place
Oh, my grace, I've got no hidin' place
Oh, my grace, I've got no hidin' place
