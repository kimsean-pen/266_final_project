Red and white, blue suede shoes
I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do?
Give me five, I'm still alive
Ain't no luck, I learned to duck
Check my pulse, it don't change
Stays seventy-two come shine or rain
Wave the flag, pop the bag
Rock the boat, skin the goat
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done come and gone, my, oh, my
I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am
Been hidin' out in a rock and roll band
Shake the hand then shock the hand
Of P. T. Barnum and Charlie Chann
Shine your shoes, light the fuse
Can you use them old U.S. Blues?
I'll drink ya health, share ya wealth
Run ya life, steal ya wife
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done come and gone, my, oh, my
Back to back chicken shack
Son of a gun, better change your act
We're all confused, what's to lose
You can call this all the United States Blues
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done come and gone, my, oh, my
Summertime done come and gone, my, oh, my
