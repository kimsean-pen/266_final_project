It's turning from day to dark
Armageddon
What made you think life was special?
When i look at you i see there is one life that's special

We don't need to live to love
Everyone has failed us
And we have failed everyone
We don't need to lose our love

Soon this will all be gone
to spare us kisses in the flood
A piece of paper in my hand
A vow of double suicide

the end of the world is avoidable

We don't need to live to love
We don't need to live to love
Everyone has failed us
And we have failed everyone
We don't need to live to love

Our fire escape is five floors
above the street
We can sit and watch Los Angeles burning
Hold hands turn around
lean over backwards
This is the quiet we promised each other
This is the love we've always dreamt of
