Hands cover whispers of the lovers' fright
Fear-cloaked renditions of that autumn night
Digging up rumours of the kids in the park
What awful things happened in the dark?

Take, just one last dare
Pretend you don't care
Till twilight falls
Wait, is someone else here?
And I can't stop my tears
I've never been so scared

In the cellar buried six feet deep
The lover's shaken from a dreamless sleep
Nails clawing splinters from the ceiling and floor
Shrieking like the witches till his stitches are sore

Take, just one last dare
Pretend you don't care
Till twilight falls
Wait, is someone else here?
And I can't stop my tears
I've never been so scared

Calling for the other, searching for her lover
Secrets she discovers drain her face of color

1, 2, 3, 4 - Underneath the cellar floor
5, 6, 7, 8 - Lovers will all suffocate

1, 2, 3, 4 - Underneath the cellar floor
5, 6, 7, 8 - Lovers will all suffocate

1, 2, 3, 4 - Underneath the cellar floor
5, 6, 7, 8 - Lovers will all suffocate

1, 2, 3, 4 - Underneath the cellar floor
5, 6, 7, 8 - Lovers will all suffocate
