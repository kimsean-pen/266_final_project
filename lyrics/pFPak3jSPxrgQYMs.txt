Whoah

Oh, Ooh
Celebration
All this talk about being in love
I could never get into the party

Never really understood what it was
Like what's the big deal anyway?
Oh, but I decided I should give it a try
The very moment that you gave me the invite
I've never seen anything like it before

Once you open the door
See I was like...
Oh yeah yeah don't get any better
Oh yeah yeah wish that this was forever
Your heart calling
Feels like confetti falling
And it's a celebration
(Whoah Oh)

Feels like a celebration
(Whoah Oh)
Cause your heart calling
Feels like confetti falling down, down, down.

And everybody's gonna make an appearance
Even the butterflies came, what a feeling.
And then bliss came with Mr. First-Kiss
It was better than they ever explained it
I think I even saw Cupid flying 'round

I caught a glimpse before the lights went down
And when I turn to see the stars in your eyes
I realize...
And I was like
Oh yeah yeah don't get any better
Oh yeah yeah wish that this was forever
Cause your heart calling
Feels like confetti falling

(Oh Yeah, Yeah)
And it's a celebration
(Whoah Oh)
Feels like a celebration
(Whoah Oh)
Cause your heart calling
Feels like confetti falling down, down, down.

See I know it's getting late
Only wish the sun would wait
And let this party last a little longer, yeah.
See I know love it comes and goes
But this right here

I don't think that I ever want to let it go
I wish I would've known...
All this talk about being in love
I could never get into the party
Now I understand only because
You show me the way
And I was like...
Oh yeah yeah don't get any better

Oh yeah yeah wish that this was forever
Your heart calling
Feels like confetti falling
And it's a celebration

Feels like a celebration
Cause your heart calling
Feels like confetti falling down, down, down.
Whoa Oh down, down, down
Whoa Oh
Your heart calling
Feels like confetti falling down, down, down.
Whoa Oh down, down, down
Whoa Oh
Cause your heart calling
Feels like confetti falling down, down, down.
