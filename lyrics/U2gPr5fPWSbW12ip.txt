Say what, say what?
Say what, say what?

Say what, say what?

I say what, say what?

My dick is bigger than yours.
I say what, say what?
I say what, say what?
I say what, say what?
My band is bigger than yours.

Too bad I got your beans in my bag,

You stuck-up sucker, Korny motherfucker.
Taking over flows is the Limp pimp,
Need a Bizkit to save this crew from Jon Davis.
I'm gonna drop a little east side skill,

You best step back 'cause I'mma kill, I'mma kill.
So what you thinking Mr. Raggedy man?
Doing all you can to look like Raggedy Ann.
Check you out punk,
Yes I know you feel it.
You look like one of those dancers,
From the Hanson video you little faggot hoe.
Please give me some shit to wank with,
'Cause right now I'm all it, kid.
Suck my dick kid like your daddy did.
Who the fuck you think you're talking to?

I'm known for eating little whiny chumps like you.
All up in my face with that, are you ready?
But halitosis is all you're rocking steady.
You little fairy, smelling on your flowers.
Nappy hairy chest, look it's Austin Powers.

I hear ya tweeting on them fag-pipes Clyde.
But you said it best, there's no place to hide.

What the fuck you saying?
You're a pimp whatever, Limp dick.
Fred Durst needs to rehearse,
Needs to reverse what he's saying.

Wanna-be funk doobiest when you're playing.
Ripping up a bad counterfeit faking.
Plus your bills I'm paying.
You can't eat that shit every day, Fred.

Lay off the bacon.
Say what, say what?
You better watch your fucking mouth Jon.

So you hate me!
And I hate you!
You know what, you know what?
It's all in the family!
I hate you!
And you hate me!
You know what?
It's all in the family!

Look at you, fool,
I'm gonna fuck you up twice.

Throwing rhymes at me like,
Oh shit alright, Vanilla Ice.
You better run, run while you can,
Can never fuck me up Bisc Limpkit.

At least I got a phat original band.
Who's hot, who's not?
You best step back, Korn on the cob.
You need a new job, time to take them mic skills.

Back to the dentist and buy yourself a new grill.
You pumpkin pie, I'll jack-off in your eye.
Climbing shoots and ladders while your ego shatters.
But you just can't get away.
Because it's doomsday kid, it's doomsday.

So I hate you!
And you hate me!
You know what, you know what?

It's all in the family!
I hate you!

And you hate me!
You know what, you know what?
It's all in the family!

You call yourself a singer?

You're more like Jerry Springer.
Your favorite band is Winger

And all you eat is Zingers.
You're like a Fruity Pebble.
Your favorite flag is rebel.
It's just too bad that you're a fag,
And on a lower level.
So you're from Jacksonville,
Kicking it like Buffalo Bill.
Getting butt-fucked by your uncle Chuck,
While your sister's on her knees waiting for your little peanut.
Wait, where'd you get that little dance?
Like them idiots in Waco,
You're burning up in Bako.
Where your father had your mother,
Your mother had your brother.
It's just too bad your father's mad,
Your mother's now your lover.
Come on hillbilly,
Can your horse do a fucking wheelie?
You love it down south and boy,
You sure do got a purdy mouth.

I hate you!
And you hate me
You know what, you know what?
It's all in my family!
And I hate you!
And you hate me!
You know what, you know what?
It's all in my family!

And I love you!
And I want you!
And I'll suck you!
And I'll fuck you!
And I'll butt-fuck you!
And I'll eat you!
And I'll lick your little dick motherfucker!
Say what, say what?
