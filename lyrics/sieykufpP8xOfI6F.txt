Hey

Havana, ooh na-na (ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ayy, ayy)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh)
Havana, ooh na-na (uh)

He didn't walk up with that "How you doin'?" (When he came in the room)
He said there's a lot of girls I can do with (But I can't without you)
I knew him forever in a minute (That summer night in June)
And papa says he got malo in him
He got me feelin' like
Oooh-oooh-ooh

I knew it when I met him (ayy)
I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like, oooh-oooh-ooh
And then I had to tell him
I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na (woo)

Havana, ooh na-na (ayy, ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ayy, ayy)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (uh huh)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)
My heart is in Havana (ayy)
Havana, ooh na-na
