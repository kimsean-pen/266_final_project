And there are those who
Hadn't found the speaking so wrong
Is it wrong?
Of Pavlov lore they ran
Rampant through the floors
Is this wrong?
Feels so wrong
Happened on a respirator
In the basement
Are they gone?
Are they gone?

Stung the slang of a gallows bird
Rationed a dead letter pure

Track-marked amoeba lands craft
Cartwheel of scratches
Dress the tapeworm as pet
Tentacles smirk please
Flinched the cocooned meat
Infra-recon forgets

Now there are those who find
Comfort in the breathing wrong
Is it wrong?
It houses the watchful eyes
Panting in a pattern in droves
Are they gone?
Happened on a respirator
In the basement
Is it gone?
Are they gone?

Stung the slang of a gallows bird
Sanctioned a dead letter pure

Track-marked amoeba lands craft
Cartwheel of scratches
Dress the tapeworm as pet
Tentacles smirk please
Flinched the cocooned meat
Infra-recon forgets

Evaporated the fur
Because it covers them
If you only knew
The plans they had for us
Evaporated the fur
Because it covers them
If you only knew
The plans they had for us

They used to have pulses in them
But impulse has made the strong
They used to have pulses in them
But impulse has made them strong

Evaporated the fur
Because it covers them
If you only knew
The plans they had for us

Track-marked amoeba lands craft
Cartwheel of scratches
Dress the tapeworm as pet
Tentacles smirk please
Flinch the cocooned meat
Infra-recon forgets

Gotta be a way
Of getting out
Are you just growing old?

Track-marked amoeba lands craft
Cartwheel of scratches
Dress the tapeworm as pet
