Love is all we got
Love is all we got and we want it all
Love is all we got
Love is all we got and we want it all

My face is numb
I like this place
Break my heart
Cut and paste

I'll try to down all my fears in downtown
Are you down are you with me I wanna fly
Play my cards learn the rules pay my dues
My world is spinning

I've been on earth
So many times
I've seen it all
I'm alright
You tell me things
I wanna hear
So let us die

As young as we are
As young as we are
As young as we are aa
As young as we are
As young as we are
As young as we are
As young as we are aa
As young as we are

Goodbye
Ohoh
I want it
You want it
We want it
As young as we are

I'm living fast
I'm on my own

I close my eyes I let go of control cut a line
I'm in trouble the end is near I don't fear
Something new something real pop my bubble

I've been on earth
So many times
I've seen it all
I'm alright
I tell you things
You wanna hear
So let us die

As young as we are
As young as we are
As young as we are aa
As young as we are
As young as we are
As young as we are
As young as we are aa
As young as we are

Goodbye
Ohoh
I want it
You want it
We want it
As young as we are

Love is all we got
Love is all we got and we want it all
Love is all we got
Love is all we got and we want it all
Love is all we got
