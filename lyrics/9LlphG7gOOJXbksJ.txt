Let's go for a drive,
and see the town tonight.
There's nothing to do,
but I don't mind when I'm with you.
This town's so strange,
they built it to change,
and while we sleep,
we know the streets get rearranged.

With my old friends,
it was so different then,
before your war
against the suburbs began.
Before it began.

Now the music divides us into tribes.
You grew your hair,
so I grew mine.
You said the past won't rest,
until we jump the fence and leave it behind.

With my old friends
I can remember when
you cut your hair,
I never saw you again.
Now the cities we live in
could be distant stars
and I search for you
in every passing car.

The night's so long...
Yeah, the night's so long.
I've been living in the shadows of your song,
been living in the shadows of your song.

In the suburbs I,
I learned to drive,
and you told me we'd would never survive,
so grab your mother's keys we leave tonight.

But you started a war
that we can't win.
They keep erasing all the streets we grew up in.
Now the music divides us into tribes.
You choose your side,
I'll choose my side.

All my old friends,
they don't know me now.
All my old friends,
are staring through me now.
All my old friends,
they don't know me now.
All my old friends,
they don't know me now.
All my old friends wait.
