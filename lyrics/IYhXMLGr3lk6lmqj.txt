Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball
When you're rockin' 'n' rollin' can't hear your momma call

From the early, early mornin' 'til the early, early night
You can see Miss Molly rockin' at the house of blue lights

Ah, good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball
When you're rockin' 'n' rollin' can't hear your momma call

Say, momma, poppa told me "Son, you better watch your step"
If I knew my momma, poppa, have to watch my pop myself

Ah, good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball
When you're rockin' 'n' rollin' can't hear your momma call

I am goin' to the corner, gonna buy a diamond ring
Would you pardon me a kissin' 'n' a ting-a-ling-a-ling?

Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball
When you're rockin' 'n' rollin' can't hear your momma call

Aaaah

Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball
When you're rockin' 'n' rollin' can't hear your momma call
