Paint a picture, using only gray
Light your pillow, lay back, watch the flames
I tell a story, no one listen that long
It's hard to imagine
It's hard to imagine
Oooh... Oooh... Oooh...

Tear into yourself count days on your arm
Ah the beatin' tickin' like a bomb
After having seen all that they saw
It's hard to imagine
It's hard to imagine
Oooh... Oooh... Oooh...

Things were different then, all is different now
I tried to explain, somehow
Things were different then, all is different now
I tried to explain, somehow

Things were different then, all is different now
I tried to explain, I hope this works somehow
Things were different then, all is different now
I tried to explain, oh, somehow
