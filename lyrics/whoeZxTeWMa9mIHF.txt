You ought to know my name
You're never looking for the right guy
I never made it rain
Why don't you like it in the sunshine?
I can't believe it
Diamonds on the ceiling
But what's the price you pay?
I can't conceive it
Oh, I must be dreaming
Baby, are you walking away?

Cause you
You can call me honey
Take all of my money
You
You ought to know my name

Someone to pay your way
Slide on a brother in the nighttime
You said you wanted to change
There's never gonna be a right time
Mourning for nothing
So much for rushing
To get ahead in the game
Your body's leaving
Everybody's stealing a little bit
Of somebody's fame

Cause you
You can call me honey
Take all of my money
You
You ought to know my name
Cause you
You can call me honey
Take all of my money
You
You ought to know my name

(I can feel it)
(I can feel it in you)
(I've been dreaming)
(I've been dreaming of you)
(I've been dreaming)
(I've been dreaming of you)
(I've been dreaming)

Cause you
You can call me honey
Take all of my money
You
You ought to know my name
Cause you
You can call me honey
Take all of my money
You
You ought to know my name
