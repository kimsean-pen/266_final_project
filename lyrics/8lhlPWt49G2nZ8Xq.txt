I cause disease
I cost us the war
I keep shooting at the sun
Forgetting
What goes up must come down
Divided by zero
Is mutually assured
I lost my ease
I'm skittish
I'm behind glass

Try to turn it off
Try to turn it off
Like it's a water main
But you have to cross this river
Flowing at full spate

Try to turn it off
Try to turn it off
Like its a water main
But you have to cross this river
Flowing at full spate

I think I'm the sun
I'm radiant
Protect your eyes

I think I'm the sun
I'm radiant
Protect your eyes

I think I'm the sun and the planets revolve around me

I think I'm the sun and the planets revolve around me

I wonder if life on earth exists without light
I'm radiant
Behind glass
I'm dying, I know that I'm dying
I mean it I mean it
I mean it I mean it I mean it
How many mean its does it take to prove your love?
