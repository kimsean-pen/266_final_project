Fuck it

I got a killer's blood
Burning deep inside my veins (down in my veins)
Don't expect you to understand
I was born without a name (no name)
I see right through you
Your opinions are a fuckin' joke
I crucify you on a silver spoon
I hope you choke

I'm tired of trying to please the world that spins around me
This time I'm doing it for me and me alone
I don't need anyone, don't think I ever did
Not trying to be selfish
Just doing what I know
I'm a menace
Right

I'll fade the fuck away
Swear to god that I don't care (I swear to Christ)
I'll die a lonely death
'Cause I know that life ain't fair (ain't fair at all)
I can't pretend that I am someone that I'm not
I live for me, myself
You can't convince me that I'm wrong

I'm tired of trying to please the world that spins around me
This time I'm doing it for me and me alone
I don't need anyone, don't think I ever did
Not trying to be selfish
Just doing what I know
I'm a menace
Right

I'm tired trying to please the world that spins around me
This time I'm doing it for me and me alone
I don't need anyone, don't think I ever did
Not trying to be selfish
Just doing what I know
I'm a menace
I'm tired trying to please the world that spins around me
This time I'm doing it for me and me alone
I don't need anyone, don't think I ever did
Not trying to be selfish
Just doing what I know
I'm a menace
Fucking menace
Menace
