I got no time for the corner boys
Down in the street making all that noise
Don't want no whores on 8th Avenue
'Cause tonight I wanna be with you

'Cause tonight I'm gonna take that ride
Across the river to the Jersey side
Take my baby to the carnival
And I'll take you on all the rides

Down the shore everything's all right
You and your baby on a Saturday night
But you know all my dreams come true
When I'm walking down the street with you

Sing sha la la la, sha la la la, sha la la la
Sha la la la I'm in love with a Jersey girl
Sha la la la, sha la la la, sha la la la

You know she thrills me with all her charms
When I'm wrapped up in my baby's arms
My little angel gives me everything
I know that some day that she'll wear my ring

So don't bother me cause I ain't got no time
I'm on my way to see that girl of mine
Nothing else matters in this whole wide world
When you're in love with a Jersey girl

Sing sha la la la, sha la la la, sha la la la
Sha la la la I'm in love with a Jersey girl
Sha la la la, sha la la la, sha la la la
And I call your name, I can't sleep at night
Sha la la la, sha la la la, sha la la la
Sha la la la I'm in love with a Jersey girl
Sha la la la, sha la la la, sha la la la
Sha la la la I'm in love, I'm in love with a Jersey girl
