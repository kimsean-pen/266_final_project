Leaf, wizz, its undescribable
Its undescribable

The way I reach this level on the beat is indescribable
My likkle vid went viral now they're telling me I'm viable
I notice in my town a couple mandem don't abide the rules
I contemplated guilty and I stumble across a grimy corpse
Didn't want to replicate the type of drama father saw
Certain man they carving nasty sore and probably laugh it off
Never could relate to that
Went to the estate and back to see my fam
I'd always pass a groupa young jamaican man
A couple times they clock me and said "What a man" you keep it
Luckily for me it werent a drama catching up and speakin
But for certain mandem boppin' by they gonna cause kerfuffles
And I knew they'd always rap about the strally (?) and the duffels
So I hated that my brother and my sister shared a garden with them
Still I found the passion for the rapping and I started spitting
Couldn't lie to get as good as I you gotta know your lines
Write a lyric every night
Build yourself a lyric library
Every single different type
Singing like, just spitting hype
Now I drop a written and they wishing that I slip and slide
I'll be standing firmer, hold my ground like I don't give a shite
Never did I give a shite,
Never did I give a shit, never not a little bit
Tell em solemn Wizzy sitting sulking about them indie kids
Sulking about them disney nicks
You know dem boy are in the mix infecting shit
Every day he gets nearer to killing Wiz

Fuck it though I bite the flow
They loving the way I be giving them energy
All of my brothers are one step ahead of our enemies
Planning and moving it heavily
Stepping up in the vicinity
I'm licking off Hennessey
All of my brothers be telling me that they be missing the skibbies
I'm doin it terribly
Rolling around with a couple of niggas
A couple of bitches, a couple of doobies
I'm rolling around with a couple of G's and a couple of dods
I be rolling with Scoobie I'm down

I'm at it, I'm rolling, I'm about it
I'm about it with this bouncer
I might box him and just bounce it
Here, here

Do the Tom and Jerry
Chase me for that cheese
I'm going overseas to get it
If she wanna get gwal (?) gotta swallow for that cheddar
She ain't looking to repent she got the needles like a medic

A likkle dirty something
Probably got a germ or something
Looking good for 65, but this nitty was 30 something
Her pussy burn your onions that's cause she fucked a herd of drunkards
Certain gyal that are responsive fiending for that deadly drunkard
Geriatric doctors couldn't feed me nothing, I'm a younger
Still my clock is ticking, it's why I break the peoples slumber
Without a pot to piss in, I just bet to keep it under
How are you supposed to pay the
rent if you ain't making beef for lunch
Never could relate to that
Went to send the stage and back
To see my fans
Always pass a group of young caucasian man
They'd always try to stop me and say "what a man you keep it"
Luckily for me it weren't a drama chatting about achievements
But for couple man they're in the scene, they gonna cause kerfuffles
Cause they'd always wanna rap about the strally (?) and the duffel
Don't wanna be friendly to people putting P in their pocket
I don't agree with that content, I think it's really obnoxious
Never could relate to that, find a way to make the cash
Tell 'em solemn wizzy sitting moaning high, evase the tax
Face the facts, I need to be rapping
Ca' wherever I drop see it reasonably adding (?), ye

Do the Tom and Jerry
Chase me for that cheese
I'm going overseas to get it
If she wanna get gwal (?) gotta swallow for that cheddar
She ain't looking to repent she got the needles like a medic
