What you gonna tell your dad
It's like a wheel of fortune
And what you gonna tell your dad
If this wheel lets you down

My love is my engine
And you might be fuel
Stop acting cool
Just bet you might win
I'm not too cool

We're gonna make you move

Don't push me
I don't want to, can't you see it
Hasten slowly
And don't count your chicks
Before the're hatched baby

What you gonna tell your dad
It's like a wheel of fortune
And what you gonna tell your dad
If this wheel lets you down

My love is my engine
And you might be fuel
Stop acting cool
Just bet you might win
I'm not too cool

Hey you
We're gonna make you move
It tastes like steel
Like a stab from a knife

What you gonna tell your daddy
What you gonna tell your daddy
Say, what you gonna tell your daddy
