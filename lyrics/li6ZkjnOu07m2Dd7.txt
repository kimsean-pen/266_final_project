even human bound
people rolling dice
image on the ground
such a novel life
he thought
while knowing nothing at all

every option noted
or tendency made
they will carry on
until the perfect date
she said
while knowing nothing at all

all the rules wide known
they mean nothing to me
everything i'm used to seems to be
fine misshapen made up fantasy
should let go
should let go

but we found something better
plain answer however
for i'll not surrender
we found something better

vis-รก-vis (face to face) estranged
and we get close
trust full of lies
sure how it goes
they told
while knowing nothing at all

talking loud 'bout future
in our hands
exchanging dreams
and how they'll last
no no
still knowing nothing at all

but we found something better
plain answer however
for i'll not surrender
we found something better

all these words reflected back to me
all these words i'm buying why?
all these words the lives grand mystery
all these words a sweet white lie

all these words she meant to say to me
all these words against my faith
all these words before she passed away
all these words we'll never never never change
