Far away from any recollection
Of the way things were before
Who cares about a memory
Lost in a sea of doubt
All I can handle is solid
I can hold it in my hand
Invade your mind with petty problems
Solved by pushing them out

I know I know a way
To pick up all the pieces
We hurt in similar ways
I'd like to share some secrets
Tear me apart in ways
All this time it's nothing
An eternity under the dirt
An eternity free from hurt
For you and I

Your foolish for wandering
Outside of the circle you keep
Wrapped up in barbed wire bruises
Beaten into skin by foes
I'm the first to stand up
And scream at the world around
Darker plot enough for all of us
We're safer here under the ground
