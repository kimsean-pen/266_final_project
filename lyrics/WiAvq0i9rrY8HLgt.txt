You know you've got, babe
You know you've got the rock 'n' roll
You know you're not, babe
You're not control, no time to go

You ain't got no shoes,
But you've got the blues
And that's enough to hit the road

You know you are, babe,
You're such a pretty girl
You can be lost, babe
Keep walking always,
Don't stop, just go

Don't wear fancy brands
But you've got friends
And that's enough to know the world

You know you've got, babe
You've got hands, ears, nails
You got the rock, babe,
can play the metal strings when dancing fails

You ain't got no guns
But you've got spurs
And that's enough to face dealers
