There's a cancer in the water
There's a knife in my lover

Battered
Disemboweled
All alone
I want more

I love you in the stall
When you're cold
And I take more

Faith
Like any other
There's a knife in my lover

Battered
Disemboweled
All alone
I want more

I love you in the stall
When you're cold
And I take more

King of kings
Comical

Love you in the stall
When you're cold
And I take more
