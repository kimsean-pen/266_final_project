Torn flowers, running towards an open dream
Long hours, watching faces in the rain
Four aspirin, two alka-seltzer and a beer
I'm laughing, but there ain't nobody here

Don't worry, it ain't about me cause

I don't let misfortune bend me all outta shape
I still get emotional when the music is on
Even though it hurts I gotta hear it again
Sayin' "Oh don't touch the radio, don't touch radio
Oh, don't touch that radio, not while I'm playing it."

Smashed vases, water dripping down the wall
Lost causes, walking through a crystal ball
Six numbers, one that brings me back to you
I'm laughing, what else am I supposed to do?

Don't worry, it ain't about me cause

I don't let misfortune bend me all outta shape
I still get emotional when the music is on
Even though it hurts I gotta hear it again
Sayin' "Oh don't touch the radio, don't touch radio
Oh, don't touch that radio, not while I'm playing it."

Night's coming, oh there's no sun in the sky
I'm running low, cold shower again
All Summer, old cars rumblin' by
I'm lovin' her so, still stuck in the film

Don't worry, it ain't about me
I'm standing where I need to be

I don't let misfortune bend me all outta shape
I still get emotional when the music is on
Even though it hurts I gotta hear it again
Sayin' "Oh don't touch the radio, don't touch radio
Oh, don't touch that radio, not while I'm playing it."
