Love, drone bomb me
Blow me from the mountains
And into the sea
Blow me from the side of the mountain
Blow my head off
Explode my crystal guts
Lay my purple on the grass

I have a glint in my eye
I think I want to die
I want to die
I want to be the apple of your eye

So drone bomb me
(Drone bomb me)
Blow me from the mountains
And into the sea
Blow me from the side of the mountain
Blow my head off
Explode my crystal guts
Lay my purple on the grass
(Lay my purple on the grass)

Let me be the first
I'm not so innocent
Let me be the one
The one that you choose from above
After all
I'm partly to blame

So drone bomb me
(I'm partly to blame)
Blow me from the mountains
And into the sea
(I need to love)
Blow me from the mountains
And into the sea

Blow me from the mountains
And into the sea
(I'm not so innocent)

Blow my head off
Explode my crystal guts

My blood, my blood
(Choose me)
My blood
(Choose me)

Choose me tonight
Choose me
Let me be the one
The one that you choose tonight
Choose me

Tonight
Tonight
