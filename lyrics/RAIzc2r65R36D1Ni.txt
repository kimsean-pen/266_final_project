Think about what you want
think about what you got
and all the things that'll heal or hurt you
but when that big bomb is full of peaches
it don't matter what the preacher preaches
the days are warm and the well is full of virtue

jack and jill went up the hill
to fetch a pail of water
jack fell down and broke his crown
because he was messing with the preachers daughter

open up your wings
make a dead man sing
such a good good thing
just can't be wrong no no no

you can't get too much love
don't you feel it in your belly go get you some
you can't get too much love
the time is right for loving so come on come on

can you feel it in your belly come on

mamma's in the kitchen
daddy's in the field
and baby girl is going to town
because she likes the way it make her feel
swimming in the river
rolling in the mud
when the juice is dripping off your chin
one peach is not enough

you can't get too much love
so if you feel it in your belly come on come on
you can't get too much love
the time is right for loving come and get you some
you cant get too much love
oh give it up, give it up, give it up

oh the light that shines upon
the gift that everyone has for the taking
and happiness so pure as this
is surely worth the making

jack and jill went up the hill
to fetch a pail of water
jack fell down and broke his crown
because he was messing with the preachers daughter

love love love love love love love
love love love love love love love

you can't get too much love
so if you feel it in your belly come and get you some
you can't get too much love
the time is right for loving say come on come on
you cant get too much love
gonna eat you're belly jelly till the kingdom comes
you cant get too much love
so give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up
