Two people are alley cats
We have an unhappy cat
He is restless, needs attention
Loses patience, seeks affection
Monkey grooms, blossom blooms
Do you dig germs? The germs
Well, we wear each other's heads like hats
Speak in tongues like alley cats
Cradle them in both our laps
When we lie alone
Wear each other's heads like hats
Speak in tongues like alley cats
Cradle them in both our laps
And we die alone
Well, we sleep inside a blankety bed
Planted like the crocuses
In the song my mother said
She wanted us to sing
We sleep inside a blankety bed
Planted like the crocuses
And I wish my mother could
See the ring I got
Ooh, ooh, there is no pain I know
Ooh, ooh, there is no pain I know
(There's no pain I know)
Ooh, ooh, there is no pain I know
There's no pain I know
There's no pain I know
There's no pain I know
The other night you said you might
It is too strong for you
It is encased in glass and stone
The other night you said you might
Try to kill that thing I love
It is invincible
It is encased in glass and stone
Painted a song
(The other night)
Painted a song
(You said you might)
It started when I was young
(Try to kill)
And now it is in my lung
(That thing I love)
Painted a song
(It feels too strong)
Painted a song
(For you)
It started when I was young
(It is encased)
And now it is in my lung
(In glass and stone)
Two people are alley cats
I get to thinking 'bout our cat
He is restless, needs attention
Loses patience, seeks affection
Monkey grooms, blossom blooms
Do you dig worms? The worms
