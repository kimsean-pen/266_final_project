Still waters, splintered skin.
For now, the storm has died down.
My door, torn and fractured.
Afloat among these troubled seas unaccompanied for days on end.
The skies are grey but winds have changed direction finally.
The thought of all now far behind no longer bothers me.
Afloat among these troubled seas unaccompanied for days on end.
Through all the lies and tired eyes, and struggles he could not foresee.
Afloat among these troubled seas, unaccompanied.
Through all the lies and tired eyes, he finally was able to see.
That land is bound show itself, as well as all the fish in the sea.
