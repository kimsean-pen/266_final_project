This ones done
Done next one come
You need to move it along son
You've had a good run
Compared to some
But it's one in one out
You can move about in your disguise
You could move around for a couple of hours
You should only come back when the sun dies
With a hope that they don't recognise
It's unknown and so they go
It's untold, it's never shown and so they go.
It's something to wait for cos it's one in one out
You won't get away once you're inside
And away the days'll fly
Well if you've done this before you can tell them
That the first won't hurt it's the next that's the lesson,
That the first won't hurt it's the next that's the lesson
Oh well then
They say that there's nothing like it
They say that we're bound to like it
Well that's one way down
But when it comes around I'll already be lying down
Nothing like it
