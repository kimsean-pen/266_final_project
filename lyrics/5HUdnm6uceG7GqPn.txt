I face the worst of both worlds in every place that I turn
It's hard enough to find balance between
When each side's destroying a part of me
I need a way
Need a way to snap this curse
Cause I can't keep up
Can't keep up when I'm in reverse
I face the worst of both worlds in every place that I turn
It's hard enough to find balance between
When each side's destroying a part of me
I fought to find a way
To rid myself of the shame
I never found a way
To carry the blame I have been cursed
I face the worst of both worlds in every place I turn
Now all I need for me is a way to break this curse
Worst of both worlds
