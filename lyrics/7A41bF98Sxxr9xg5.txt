Ayy
See me run, see me run
Run until my lungs might give
Runnin' for the front, I feel like Usain in this b*tch (ayy)
Passin' all these runners, number one is in my list
Blinders on me, I can't even see

See me in my tour bus by myself
Call me selfish 'cause I got me and nobody else
Give myself an envelope just like it's per diem (ayy)
Twenty mirrors in my crib, I'm hanging with my friends

Feelin' like I traveled through some time, oh man
Skippin' through some years but it feel right, oh yeah
Gettin' ready for some blessings comin' our way
Forrest, Forrest runnin' for some days

I do the shit 'til the credits roll
Already got through the greatest goals
Met with a girl when I went back home (ayy)
She put me in the group chat with that pu*sy
Talk to her, send emojis to the pussy
Then beat it up 'til her wanna go sue me (ayy)
My brother called me and told me to man up
Told me to be lactose tolerant
Messed up avoidin' that cheddar (ayy)
In love with the Solo cups
I'm on a roll but I'm lovin' my bucks
Still missin' home, but I'm havin' my fun, uh
I would never quit, I'm too legit
Indonesian MC Hammer in this bitch
Beat your a*s if you correct my grammar in this bitch
I done way too much for you to say my parents' rich (nah)
But I'm tryna make it happen
Makin' green like Geico
On me 'cause I'm nice, so
They know what I like though
Pussy on my rider
Groupies is some psychos
My bedroom is a psych ward
Tell that girl to smile more
I take it on my life, girl

Feelin' like I traveled through some time, oh man
Skippin' through some years but it feel right, oh yeah
Gettin' ready for some blessings comin' our way
Forrest, Forrest runnin' for some days

See me run, see me run
Run until my lungs might give
Runnin' for the front, I feel like Usain in this b*tch (ayy)
Passin' all these runners, number one is in my list
Blinders on me, I can't even see
See me in my tour bus by myself
Call me selfish 'cause I got me and nobody else
Give myself an envelope just like it's per diem
Twenty mirrors in my crib, I'm hanging with my friends
