they always get away with attitude
but they'll try to convince you of your mood
what you want they'll give it to you
but it's only therapy, that's all they do

she was anti-pioneer
singing sappy songs

about what went wrong
two years before
but even now when the false is true
when i call me you
When the flag changes colours
the language knows

when the month changes numbers

When the flag changes colors
the language knows

when the month changes numbers
it's time to go
anti-pioneer
anti-pioneer

anti-pioneer
anti-pioneer
When the flag changes colours
the language knows
when the month changes numbers
it's time to go
When the flag changes colours
the language knows
when the month changes numbers
it's time to go
