Well I'm gonna have to do it
Sooner or later so I might as
Well get on with it

Better get on with it again
I missed it that time

Ready when you are...

Well, since my baby left me
Well, I found a new place to dwell
Well, it's down at the end of Lonely Street
At Heartbreak Hotel
Where I'll be--
Where I'll be so lonely, baby
I'll be so lonely
I could die

Well although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken-hearted lovers
To cry there in the gloom
Where I'll be so lonely, baby
I'll be so lonely
They'll be so lonely
They could die
