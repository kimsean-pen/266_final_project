The trouble with your brother,
He's always sleeping with your mother.
And I know that your sister missed her time again this month.
Am I talking too fast or are you just playing dumb?
If you want I can write it down.
It should matter to you,
Cos aren't you the one,
With your razzmatazz and the nights on the town?

Oh you knew it, and you blew it didn't you babe?
I was lying when I asked you to stay.
Now no-one's gonna care,
If you don't call them when you said.
And he's not coming round tonight to try and talk you into bed.
And all those stupid little things,
They ain't working,
No they ain't working any more.

You started getting fatter,
Three weeks after I left you.
And now you're going with some kid who looks like some bad comedian.
Are you gonna go out?
Or are you sitting at home eating boxes of milk tray?
Watch tv on your own, aren't you the one,
With your razzmatazz and your nights on the town?

And your father wants to help you doesn't he babe?
But your mother wants to put you away.
Now no-one's gonna care,
If you don't call them when you said.
And he's not coming round tonight to try and talk you into bed.
And all those stupid little things,
They ain't working,
No they ain't working any more.

Oh well I saw you at the doctor's,
Waiting for a test.
You tried to look like some kind of heiress,
But your face is such a mess.
And now you're going to a party,
And you're leaving on your own.
Well, I'm sorry, but didn't you say,
That things go better with a little bit of razzamatazz?

And now no-one's gonna care,
If you don't call them when you said.
And he's not coming round tonight to try and talk you into bed.
Now it's half past ten in the evening,
And you wish that you were dead,
Cos all those stupid little things,
They ain't working,
No they ain't working any more.
