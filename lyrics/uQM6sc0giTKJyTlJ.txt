"Hello, Mary Lou
Goodbye, heart
Sweet Mary Lou
I'm so in love with you
I knew, Mary Lou
We'd never part
So hello, Mary Lou
Goodbye, heart"

Passed me by one sunny day
Flashed those big, brown eyes my way
And ooh, I wanted you forevermore
I'm not one that gets around
Swear my feet stuck to the ground
And though I never did meet you before

I said, "Hello, Mary Lou
Goodbye, heart
Sweet Mary Lou
I'm so in love with you
I knew, Mary Lou
We'd never part.
So hello, Mary Lou
Goodbye, heart"

Saw your lips, I heard your voice
Believe me, I just had no choice
Wild horses couldn't make me stay away
Thought about a moonlit night
Arms around you good an' tight
That's all I had to see for me to say

"Hey, hey, hello, Mary Lou
Goodbye, heart.
Sweet Mary Lou
I'm so in love with you
I knew, Mary Lou
We'd never part
So hello, Mary Lou
Goodbye, heart
So hello, Mary Lou
Goodbye, heart
Yes, hello, Mary Lou
Goodbye, heart"
