In these flowers I found you the truest red that I'd ever seen
Until you cut yourself on their thorns
You winced and I kissed you
I kissed your palms and we both laughed
So unaware of the gathering storm

It's gonna rain
It's gonna rain
Till the levee breaks
And a tidal wave
Of fear and pain
Carries us away
I'll never fade
Into the night
Until nothing else remains
How do we find
Harbor from the hurricane?

No shelter, no shadows, the quiet song of your breath stirs the dark
Your skin like the rose at my hands
And I can't keep from wondering why nothing good
Could ever stay
My faith feels
Like a fist full of sand

It's gonna rain
It's gonna rain
Till the levee breaks
And a tidal wave
Of fear and pain
Carries us away
I'll never fade
Into the night
Until nothing else remains
How do we find
Harbor from the hurricane?

It's gonna rain
It's gonna rain
Till the levee breaks
And a tidal wave
Of fear and pain
Carries us away
I'll never fade
Into the night
Until nothing else remains
How do we find
Harbor from the hurricane?
