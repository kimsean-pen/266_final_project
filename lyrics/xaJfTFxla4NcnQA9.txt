This is my five string serenade
Beneath the water we've played
And while I'm playing for you
It could be written 'bout you

This is my five string serenade
Beneath the water we've played
And while I'm playing for you
It could be written 'bout you

And on my easel I drew
While I was thinking of you
And on the roof of my head
In came my five string serenade

This is my five string serenade
Beneath the water we've played
And while I'm playing for you
It might be written 'bout you

And on my easel I drew
While I was thinking of you
And on the roof of my head
In came my five string serenade

This is my five string serenade
Beneath the water we've played
And though I'm playing for you
It might be written 'bout you

This is my five string serenade
