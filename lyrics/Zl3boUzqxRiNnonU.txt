You better love lovin' and you better behave
You better love lovin' and you better behave

Woman in chains
Woman in chains

Calls her man, the great white hope
Says she's fine, she'll always cope
Ooh, woman in chains
Woman in chains

Well I feel lyin' and waitin' is a poor man's deal
(A poor man's deal)
And I feel hopelessly weighed down by your eyes of steel
(Your eyes of steel)
Well it's a world gone crazy
Keeps woman in chains
Whoa Whoa Whoa

Woman in chains
Woman in chains

Trades her soul as skin and bones
Sells the only thing she owns, hoo
Woman in chains
Woman in chains

Men of stone
Men of stone
Hey no no no no no
Hoo

Well I feel deep in your heart, there are wounds time can't heal
(That time can't heal)
And I feel somebody, somewhere is trying to breathe
Well you know what I mean
It's a world gone crazy
Keeps woman in chains
It's under my skin but out of my hands
I'll tear it apart but I won't understand
We will not accept the greatness of man
(World gone crazy, keeps woman in chains)
It's a world gone crazy
Keeps woman in chains
So free her x15
