By myself I don't think anybody else
Even cares
If all is well
You're only thinking of yourself

It's a long way down
It's a long way down
For me
The satellite
Orbiting the world alone
Tell me I'm coming home

By myself I don't think anybody knows
I'm even here
But do tell
You think you understand my fears

It's a long way down
It's a long way down
For me
The satellite
Orbiting the world alone
Tell me I'm coming home
To be the satellite
Knowing I'm the only one
After all's
Said and done

It's a long way down
It's a long way down

For me
The satellite
Orbiting the world alone
Tell me I'm coming home
To be
The satellite
Knowing I'm the only one
After all's
Said and done
