Joan
You are alone
Your kindness
The sweetest that I've ever known
Like honeycomb
Holding the bee in the folds

Be good
Be good or be gone
Oh I slept like a baby
With you in my arms
Oh I slept like a baby
With you in my arms
Out of harm

Be well
Bring our upsells
And you tended your garden
Like heaven and hell
And you built the birds' houses
To see if it helped at all

And be known
Lover of song
And I still watch the fig tree
You planted all grow
And it's fruit is the sweetest
That I've ever known

Like honeycomb
Holding the bee in the folds
Like honeycomb
Holding the bee in the folds
Like honeycomb
Holding the bee in the folds
