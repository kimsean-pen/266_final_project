Small town witch come to mess me up
Small town witch come to mess me up
Small town witch come to mess me up
Small town witch come to mess me up, yeah
Small town witch come to mess me again

See black, see bloom, died on an impulse over you
Caught like a corpse crawling round a dream and loving you
And she hangs on youth crushing any feet to fit the shoes
Stepping it out with a size twelve mouth and cursing you

Small town witch come to mess me up
Small town witch come to mess me up
Small town witch come to mess me up again

Small town witch come to mess me up
Small town witch come to mess me up
Small town witch come to mess me up again

She whored and she graced, bitching with a bottle, saving face
Blowing it out as the jury's doubt is laid to waste
I see black, see bloom, choked up on heartburn, bleeding through
How does it feel when the ones that feed are biting you?

Small town witch come to mess me up
Small town witch come to mess me up
Small town witch come to mess me up again

Small town witch come to mess me up
Small town witch come to mess me up
Small town witch come to mess me up again

Small town witch come to mess me, oh yeah
Small town witch come to mess me, oh yeah
