Here is tomorrow
Just past the sunrise
My fingers reaching out
'Cause we are believers
The guards of the skyline
The curse can't tie us down

We've waited so long
We waited long enough

This is our right, this is our song
This is our moment in history
Ten million roads turn into one
This is our fight, where we belong
No one can take away destiny
So let the night cover us all
Stars will never fall

I try to remember
Frozen in silence
Our blood red beating cold
But oh let the darkness
Always remind us
To never let this go

Keep holding on
We've waited long enough

This is our right, this is our song
This is our moment in history
Ten million roads turn into one
This is our fight, where we belong
No one can take away destiny
So let the night cover us all
Stars will never fall
Stars will never fall

So brave the dark
'Cause the day is ours
And there's nothing left to stop us
'Cause we are believers
The guards of the skyline

This is our right, this is our song
This is our moment in history
Ten million roads turn into one
This is our fight, where we belong
No one can take away destiny
So let the night cover us all
Stars will never fall
Stars will never fall
