Coming down slowly
Coming down slowly
Watching the water rise and fall again
I want to know what you think about
I feel alone when we're apart
So shut me up, don't shut me out

Let me down slowly
Let me down slowly
Fragile mind will break into a thousand parts
After all this time still running from the same things
It feels like all my life I'm running from the same things

I put it all on the line, would you be my escape plan?
I put it all on the line, would you be my escape plan?

Coming down slowly
Coming down slowly
Prettiest words couldn't fix what was torn apart
I know something's wrong, I've got a feeling that I can't shake
Wasting all my time just wishing that you could stay

Under the surface you confront yourself
You wonder what life would be like if I was someone else

But I am patient, I refuse to concede or believe
That I am only what you want me to be
Only what you want me to be

I put it all on the line, would you be my escape plan?
I put it all on the line, would you be my escape plan?

I put it all on the line, would you be my escape plan?
I put it all on the line, would you be my escape plan?
