I followed you again this morning
I was close enough to feel you near
Pretending everyone could see me
Just slip away and disappear

They're right behind you, there's someone behind you
They're all behind you, they're on the run
As good as blind I'm all the time
Somewhere to find, somewhere to find
They're all aligned, they're intertwined
You're undermined, there's someone behind
They recognize, so hard to find
As good as blind, I'm out of time

I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this

I had a friend, I think you knew me
I couldn't seem to make you see
I know they're watching me and falling
I know I'll never get away

I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this

I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this

I'm running out, I'm running out, I'm running out, I'm running out
I'm running out, I'm running out, I'm running out, I'm running out
I'm running out, I'm running out, I'm running out, I'm running out
I'm running out, I'm running out, I'm running out, I'm running out

I'll never get away
I'll never get away
I'll never get away
