When I think about you
My feelings can't explain
Why after all this time
My heart still feels pain
When I look at you
Memories of love
Like no one before
You'll stay on my mind
Special feelings, special times
(Always so special)
I was yours and you were mine
(Made for each other)
All the good I won't forget
(You will stay on my mind)
Saturday, the day we met
For always and forever
You will be my Saturday love

When I look at you
Memories of love
Like no one before
You stay on my mind
Special feelings, special times
(Feeling so special)
I was yours and you were mine
(Made for each other, girl)
All the good I won't forget
(Staying on my mind, girl)
Saturday, the day we met
Girl, you know I can't
Leave you behind
Never Sunday, Monday's too soon
Tuesday, Wednesday just won't do
Thursday, Friday we can't get
Saturday love will never end
