To settle our thoughts
Never minding what for
Nothing of a harm to dread on my mind
So tell me what belies
Oh, tell me what I could have
Oh, oh tell me what for
No more of this living, dying
Just scientific analyzing
Forgive us, oh life
The sin of
Death, oh baby
You know that dying is fine but maybe
I wouldn't like death if death were good
Not even if death were good
Is this it
Maundering about and
All I have is too much time to understand
That one can only love
Life until its ending
Oh, and I can't forget
No more of this living, dying
Just scientific analyzing
Forgive us, oh life
The sin of
Death, oh baby
You know that dying is fine but maybe
I wouldn't like death if death were good
Not even if death were good
Death, oh baby
You know that dying is fine but maybe
I wouldn't like death if death were good
Not even if death were good
Death, oh baby
You know that dying is fine but maybe
I wouldn't like death if death were good
Not even if death were good
Death, oh baby
You know that dying is fine but maybe
I wouldn't like death if death were good
Not even if death were good
