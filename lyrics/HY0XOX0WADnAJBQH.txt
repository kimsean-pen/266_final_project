Calling me blind
Silhouettes in the neon lights
I think you like me out of focus
And I think I like you in the moment
I'm staring in your lights
Got you sippin' on my soul like wine
Trading glances like we're lonely
Tell me if you taste my motives

I want to feel alive
Devil's in the backseat
You were up front looking at me
With those hazel eyes
Riding with my hand on your lap
Sing baby don't you ask me
'Cause I can only feed you lies
Devil's got a hold and we're laughing
You don't even know me
But you're calling me daddy
I'm running on red through the canyon
Singing I'm a bad man, bad man

Baby if I told you it would never be enough
It'll never be enough to trust, oh
Baby let me show you
I ain't thinking love
I only want to get to know you before I go

Only want to get to know you before I'm gone

Keep me in the lines
87 on the 405
Acting like I didn't even notice
You were reaching out your hand for me to hold it
Right
But I'm not that guy
Don't tell me you can change my mind
I'll tell you everything you want to hear babe
Try to give it to you while I'm here babe
Hey

Devil's in the backseat
You were up front looking at me
With those hazel eyes
Riding with my hand on your lap
Sing baby don't you ask me
'Cause I can only feed you lies
Devil's got a hold and we're laughing
You don't even know me but
You're calling me ya daddy
I'm running on red through the canyon
Singing I'm a bad man

Baby if I told you it would never be enough
It'll never be enough to trust, oh
Baby let me show you
I ain't thinking love
I only want to get to know you before I go

Only want to get to know you before I'm gone

No one has to know, oh
When we do it wrong
When we do it right
When we do it wrong

Now you're in the backseat
Sittin' on my lap tryna tell me that you're nasty
I wonder if the devil's even packing
Baby don't you know I'm a bad man

Baby if I told you it would never be enough
It'll never be enough to trust, oh
Baby I told you
I'll never be the one
I only want to get to know you before I'm gone

I'm gone
