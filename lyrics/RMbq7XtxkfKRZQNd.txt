That's what they said to me
"There's something wrong with you, why don't you disappear?"
That's what they said to me
Why should we all be stereotypes?
Why don't we all just stand up and fight?
In my blood, in my veins, in my heart
I know what's right for me
So I refuse

To apologize for who I am
Oh I refuse
To ever let somebody say I can't
I refuse I refuse I refuse
I refuse I refuse I refuse
So I refuse
To let the words you say get to me
Oh I refuse
To keep on suffering quietly
I refuse I refuse I refuse
I refuse I refuse I refuse
So I refuse
So I refuse
"You'll never make it far, you are just a hopeless case"

That's what they said to me
"How can I make it clear? You are just a big mistake"
That's what they said to me
You don't patrol me, this is my life

When will you wake up and open your eyes?
In my blood, in my veins, in my heart
I know what's right for me
So I refuse

To apologize for who I am
Oh I refuse
To ever let somebody say I can't
I refuse I refuse I refuse
I refuse I refuse I refuse
So I refuse
To let the words you say get to me
Oh I refuse
To keep on suffering quietly
I refuse I refuse I refuse
I refuse I refuse I refuse
No matter what you think you won't decide my faith

I can't do anything, no matter what you say
Cuz' in my blood, in my veins, in my heart
I know what's right for me
So I refuse

To apologize for who I am
Oh I refuse
To ever let somebody say I can't
I refuse I refuse I refuse
I refuse I refuse I refuse
So I refuse
To let the words you say get to me
Oh I refuse
To keep on suffering quietly
I refuse I refuse I refuse
I refuse I refuse I refuse
So I refuse
So I refuse
