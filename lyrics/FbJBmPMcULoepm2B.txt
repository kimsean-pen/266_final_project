I fall asleep in the arms of July
Under the blanket of the night
This new light fills the sky
I don't recognize the pigment

My bed is spun by web
Cool breeze of night air silky nightmare
Fly by, the night, day light, it wakes me
Erase my memory

I lend a hand, it breaks, I see their heads shaking
Deja vu, return to blue
Find every way to make a crucial mistake and
Deja vu, return to blue

Even in my dreams, I can't win
Even in my dreams, I can't win

I feel as though I've lost touch
With the person who I once was as a child
Now the smoke helps to show me
My perfect, faded memories

My bed is cherry red
I found your love here, naive and sincere
Fly by, the night, day light, it wakes me
Erase my memory

I lend a hand, it breaks, I see their heads shaking
Deja vu, return to blue
Find every way to make a crucial mistake and
Deja vu, return to blue

Even in my dreams, I can't win
Even in my dreams, I can't win

Have you ever felt that thing?
It's like a thunder within
Have you ever had that dream
Where you couldn't swim?
The lightning, it strikes
In the darkness of night
I'm out in the middle of the sea
Suddenly I'm awake
But I'm still in that scene
In a storm lost at sea

My bed is sewn by thread
I found your love here, naive and sincere
Fly by, my life, daylight escapes me
It's just a memory

I lend a hand, it breaks, I see their heads shaking
Deja vu, return to blue
Find every way to make a crucial mistake and
Deja vu, return to blue

Even in my dreams, I can't win
Even in my dreams, I can't win
