i thought i felt a spark
i thought i saw a flame
then something changed in you
who took the blame
my plan was foolproof
as i became the fortress of your heart

love, the kind that kills and scars
will make you kneel and crawl to hell and back
the words that slit your throat
and make you think of love as the new black
as what you lack
love

the sound of letting go
the sight of youth
that we all set aside
when the world was new
under the full moon
only endless rain
and absence of your heart

love, the kind that kills and scars
will make you kneel and crawl to hell and back
the words that slit your throat
and make you think of love as the new black
as what you lack
love
