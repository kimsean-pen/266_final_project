I was dreaming when I jumped the lights
Busy scaling dizzy heights
Hummed a somewhat strangely familiar tune

My eyes as wide as open books
And from my ears upon two hooks
A big smile was hanging there like a crescent moon

It sometimes comes as quite a shock
When the Gods of love
When the Gods of love decide to knock

You're in a state of disarray
Just when you least expect it
You'll never know a better day

Day dreaming fever taking over
No misdemeanour
Stone cold sober

The officer who stopped me said
"Lucky you didn't wind up dead"
And he guessed that I was over and above

I hoped he'd only caution me
I made a plea for clemency
On the grounds that I was only there drunk on love

It sometimes comes as quite a shock
When the Gods of love
When the Gods of love decide to knock

You're in a state of disarray
Just when you least expect it
You'll never know a better day

Day dreaming fever taking over
No misdemeanour
Stone cold sober

Day dreaming fever taking over
No misdemeanour
Stone cold sober

It sometimes comes as quite a shock
When the Gods of love decide to knock
And leave you in a state of total disarray
Just when you least expect it, you'll never know a better day

You'll never know, you'll never know
You'll never know a better day, yeah
You'll never know a better day
You'll never know a better day

Day dreaming fever taking over
No misdemeanour
Stone cold sober

Day dreaming fever taking over
No misdemeanour
Stone cold sober
