Sinking into the sheets
Sinking into defeat
Step softly, as I lay beneath
I spread myself under your feet

Step softly, as I lay beneath
I spread myself under your feet

I had a lot to learn about respect
When you told me you were better off dead
Tell me something I can sing
Tell me anything

What is this place in hell that I know so well?
This life is a labour
I will slave until I'm able to forget myself

But I sink into defeat
Step softly, as I lay beneath
I spread myself under your feet

I had a lot to learn about respect
I thought a lot about the things that you said
The younger men have wished for death
But I will carry on because I am my father's son
I am my mother's love
And I will earn your name

What is this place in hell that I know so well?
This life is a labour

I will slave until I'm able to forget myself
I shut myself away from endless tragedy

My head gets in the way of the man I try to
The man I try to be
