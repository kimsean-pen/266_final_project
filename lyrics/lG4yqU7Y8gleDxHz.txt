Face the cold reality
Slow and with formality
I'm obsessively stabbing you
The blood is drowning you
As you gargle and you spew
Bodily fluids fill your lungs.
This is the end of you
Your consciousness slips away
Leaving your cunt to me
The lacerations haemorrhage on me
I will now disembowel every organ to see
My indulgence, the bloodlust in me
The en-slaver
The engraver to the creek bed that marks your resting place
The engraver to the creek bed that marks your resting place
Bring my image to the void
Remember my face
When you see god
The cinder block
Tied to your foot
Drags you straight down
To the bottom
Gracefully your body dances
The murky water sways the flesh exposed
I exist
To rid the world of throbbing cysts
I drain the pus
Embedded in society
With their disposal
I silence them and have my taste
A balanced order
Extinction of the human waste
Decapitation fornication
This is the fate for abominations
Decapitation fornication
I am a servant of the earth.
