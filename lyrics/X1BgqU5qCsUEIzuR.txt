When I'm done with thinking
Then I'm done with you
And when I'm done with crying
And then I'm done with you

When I feel so tired
Then I'm done with you
You know everybody feels this way sometimes
Everybody feels this way

And I do
You can't hear it, but I do
You can't hear it, but I do

You're trying to convince me
That what I've done's not right
And I get so frustrated
I stay up every night

You ask me for an answer
And I'm so tired and I'm up in the air
(I'm up in the air)
You know everybody feels this way sometimes
Everybody feels this way

And I do
You can't hear it, but I do
You can't hear it, but I'm feeling this way
Just because you say

I will be ignored
And I will be denied
And I could be erased
I could be brushed aside

And I will get scared
And I will get shoved down
But I feel like I do
Because you push me around

I'm starting to ignore you
Or I doubted you so long
I'm tired of over-thinkin'
I know you don't belong

Now I'm asking questions
No one pushes me around
Everybody feels this ways sometimes
Everybody feels this way

And I do
You can't hear it, but I do
You don't seem angry, but I do
I do, I do
I, I, I do

You don't seem angry, but I do
You don't hear it, but I do
I, I, I do
You can't hear it, but I do
You don't seem angry, but I do
