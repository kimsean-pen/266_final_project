All the towers of ivory are crumbling
And the swallows have sharpened their beaks
This is the time of our great undoing
This is the time that I'll come running

Straight to you
For I am captured
Straight to you
For I am captured
One more time

Oh, the light in our window is fading
The candle gutters on the ledge
Well now sorrow, it comes a-stealing
And I'll cry, girl, but I'll come running

Straight to you
For I am captured
Straight to you
For I am captured
Once again

Gone are the days of rainbows
And gone are the nights of swinging from the stars
For the sea will swallow up the mountains
And the sky will throw thunderbolts and sparks

Straight at you
But I'll come running
Straight to you
But I'll come running
One more time

Oh, heaven has denied us its kingdom
And the saints, they're all drunk, and howling at the moon
And chariots of angels are colliding
Well, I'll run, babe, but I'll come running

Straight to you
For I am captured
Straight to you
For I am captured
One more time
