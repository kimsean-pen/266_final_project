Coming back from Paris on the train
I really didn't care if the journey took all day
Trying to turn the pages of my magazine
While trying to keep a hold of your hand
And ordering a coffee that I wouldn't ever drink

Just to keep you and Paris on my mind
Just to keep you and Paris on my mind
I didn't know it would be the last time
The last time I saw you

At Waterloo we went our separate ways
When I got in my cab I didn't turn and wave
Didn't go to work just went to bed

Trying to keep you and Paris on my mind
Trying to keep you and Paris on my mind
I didn't know it would be the last time
The last time I saw you

I phoned your office this afternoon
They said they hadn't heard anything from you
It's been seven days without a word

I have to keep you and Paris on my mind
I have to keep you and Paris on my mind
I didn't know it would be the last time
The last time I saw you

Going back to Paris on the train
Raining and without you, it's not the same
I have to do this journey one more time

Just to keep you and Paris on my mind
Just to keep you and Paris on my mind
I didn't know it would be the last time
The last time I saw you

The last time I saw you
The last time I saw you
The last time I saw you
