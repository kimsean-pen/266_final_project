My defenses become fences
I'm stumbling I change my face
And if you think I'm fake up
Wait around till I take off my make-up

Here we go again I need another one
Her name is
She looks at me
Says I'm the only one

I met a, a Christian in Christiansands
A Devil in Helsinki
I met a Christian in Christiansands
A Devil in Helsinki

Is it getting better?
Wrote her a letter asking questions
Baby steps in sections
I mean we'll take it slow

I really don't know
When you talk you make me cringe
Silver means your messenger
Let her go don't question her

I met a, a Christian in Christiansands
A Devil in Helsinki
I met a, Christian in Christiansands
A Devil in Helsinki

It means we'll manage, master your language
And in the meantime I'll create my own
