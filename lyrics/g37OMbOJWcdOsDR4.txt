Shine on me
With more than
I ever thought I had

Make me see
The release
In the words that I've shared

Shine on me
With more than
I ever thought I had

Make me see why
I should not fade away
Let me feel where you stand

We've shared fears of no use
We've shared fears of self-abuse
Let me feel where you stand

I feel what you feel
And you know what I know
The only way to make it right
Is to keep it real

This will not fade away
We've lived every word we've screamed
Together, hearts in hand

You thank me for being me
Well, thank you for allowing me
To be just who I am

I feel what you feel
And you know what I know
The only way to make it right
Is to make it real

I feel what you feel
And you know what I know
The only way to keep it right
Is to keep it real

We will not go away
We will not fade away
No matter who I am

We will not go away
We will not fade away
No matter who I am

Shine on me
With more than
I ever thought I had

Make me see
The release
In the words that I've shared

I feel what you feel
And you know what I know
The only way to make it right
Is to make it real

I feel what you feel
And you know what I know
The only way to keep it right
Is to keep it real

We will not go away
We will not fade away
No matter who I am

We will not go away
We will not fade away
No matter who I am

Shine on
