Caught out, at 23
Eye of a lion, dancing queen
Young mind, in the back yard
You've always been the king of it, playing hard

I know it, you're made of it, born with it
I know it
I know it, you rise from it, pray on it
I know it, you leave with no trace of it

It's the power of you
Reign in gold, beautiful
It's the fight in you

Wild heart, dressed in jewels
She on a mission, don't you know Ruby rules
Fire up, turn it back around
We can see you rising up about the crowd, you're far away but we can hear you shout

I know it, you're made of it, born with it
I know it
I know it, I'll rise from it, pray on it
I know it, I leave with no trace of it

It's the power of you
Reign in gold, beautiful
It's the fight in you

Don't go easily
Please stay with me
We live so dangerously
Magic inside
You are a king of your kind
Won't be staying behind

I know it, you're made of it, I swear on it

It's the power of you
It's the fight in you
