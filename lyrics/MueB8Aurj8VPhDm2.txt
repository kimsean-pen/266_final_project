Some say that we're never gonna find it
Some say it's right under our noses
Sometimes we switch to autopilot
To go where we never dare to go
To forget
To forget
That in the shadows
of cities that never sleep we sin
In the shadows
of suburbs that slowly close us in
In the shadows
of cities that never sleep we sin
Elbowing our way out of this concrete skin
Some say that the truth is right behind us
Sometimes we're looking back for more
Sometimes we sabotage our wires
To go where we never dare to go
To forget
To forget
That in the shadows
of cities that never sleep we sin
In the shadows
of suburbs that slowly close us in
In the shadows
of cities that never sleep we sin
Elbowing our way out of this concrete skin
Just a little bit more skin
Show me a little more skin
Just a little bit more skin
Show me a little more skin
In the shadows of suburbs that slowly close us in
In the shadows of cities that never sleep we sin
Elbowing our way out of this concrete skin
Just a little bit more skin
Show me a little more
