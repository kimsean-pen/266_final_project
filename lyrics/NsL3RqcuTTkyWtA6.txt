I've thrown away...
I've thrown away again
The pills that make me
I've thrown away...
I've thrown away again
The chance, the want to change
I've thrown away...
I've thrown away again
Standing all alone
I've thrown away...
I've thrown away again...

Eyes wired shut
Running through my brain
Pulling back the skin
It happens, we're getting older
Eyes wired shut
Running through my brain
It's all the same
But in the end, it keeps me coming

I've blown away...
I've blown away again
The fear of failing
I've blown away...
I've blown away again
The lies that make me sane
I've blown away
The chance to make it right
I want to be
I want to see
I want to make it back to me

Eyes wired shut
Running through my brain
Pulling back the skin
It happens, we're getting older
Eyes wired shut
Running through my brain
It's all the same
But in the end, it keeps me coming

It's time to face (away?)
A chance to talk and make some change
To make myself to think that things were better

Eyes wired shut
Running through my brain
Pulling back the skin
It happens, we're getting older
Eyes wired shut
Running through my brain
It's all the same
But in the end, it keeps me coming
Eyes wired shut
Running through my brain
Pulling back the skin
It happens, we're getting older
Eyes wired shut
Running through my brain
It's all the same
But in the end, it keeps me coming
