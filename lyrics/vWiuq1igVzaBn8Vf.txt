The rocks
they will always hold in the sea
and erosion can't stop their being
oh no currents can defeat them
and I am thankful for the love
these rocks have always given
and although
this boat is steady now
one wave could pull me under
and I'll be stranded out at sea
and I will pray that those rocks
will be there for me

and the sun always shines down on your shoes
could be a blue blue christmas for you*
'cos when the sun always shines down on your shoes
could be a blue blue christmas for you

I love the way that your hair is always neat
and your skirts fall below your knees
and your love is so pure and so clean

oh, it comforts me (x4)

I love the way that you're always surprised
oh, to find truth in all my lies
'cos you trust me and ignore my disguise

oh, it comforts me (x4)

but there's no need to play with my heart (x15)
