Oh, Susie
We've run out of time
Oh, Susie
Say what's on your mind
We've got nowhere to run
We were much too young

Oh, Susie
We've run out of time
Oh, Susie
Say what's on your mind
We've got nowhere to run
We were much too young

Love is warm
And understanding
When your 17

Love is cold
Kills your dreams and schemes

Much too young
The words are coming
Like a neon light

Off and on
Bringing back last night
Bringing back last night

Oh, Susie
We've run out of time
Oh, Susie
Say what's on your mind
We've got nowhere to run
We were much too young

Oh, Susie
We've run out of time
Oh, Susie
Say what's on your mind
We've got nowhere to run
We were much too young

I'm in love
And nothing else
Can make me feel this way

Now I'm lost
Not much more to say

Radio
The song they're playing
Can't be rightly sung

Off and on
Singin' much too young
Singin' much too young

Oh, Susie
We've run out of time
Oh, Susie
Say what's on your mind
We've got nowhere to run
We were much too young

Oh, Susie
We've run out of time
Oh, Susie
Say what's on your mind
We've got nowhere to run
We were much too young

Oh, Susie
We've run out of time
Oh, Susie
Say what's on your mind
We've got nowhere to run
We were much too young

We were much too young

Oh, Susie
We've run out of time
Oh, Susie
Say what's on your mind
We've got nowhere to run
We were much too young
