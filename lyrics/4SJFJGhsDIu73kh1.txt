Hey, they said it didn't recede so it all points back to you
They reckon you had them, all points back to you
Everyone I ask is the same so there's only one conclusion
Look at it from my point of view then there's really no confusion

All, all points back to you
It all points back to you
I ain't pointing fingers but it all points back to you
It all points back to you

I have nothing to say, it all comes back to you
Ok, have it your way, it all points back to you
'Cause I ain't really messing so you better start letting loose
Trust me, I ain't really stressing, 'cause I already have the truth

It all points back to you
It all points back to you
I ain't pointing fingers but it all points back to you
It all points back to you

What you gonna do?
What you gonna say?
How you gonna make it right?
What you gonna do?
What you gonna say?
How you gonna stop the fight?
Ah, but you did it, drew the points back to you
You did it, you did it, it all points back to you
You did it, you did it, you did it
You did it, you did it, you did it
