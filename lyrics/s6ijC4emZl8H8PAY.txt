I can't fix you
You've gotta face these demons on your own
And I can't save you
But I promise you you'll never be alone
Take my hand and take a deep breath
You don't have a lot of chances left

When the road is long and it's dark as the night
If you get too scared just hold me tight
You're the only one who can make things right
And I can't fix you
I can't fix you

I still love you
You're everything to me I hope you know
That I still need you
To get yourself out of this hole
Promise me you're better than this
Promise me you won't give in

When the road is long and it's dark as the night
If you get too scared just hold me tight
You're the only one who can make things right
I can't fix you

I can't break
You can beat this baby
My faith is strong
When the smoke is clear
And the battle is won
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting

When the road is long and it's dark as the night
If you get too scared just hold me tight
You're the only one who can make things right
When the road is too long and you think you're gonna fall
There's a still small voice beyond temptations fall
So the choice is yours
And we're gonna lose it all

I can't fix you
I can't fix you
I can't fix you
