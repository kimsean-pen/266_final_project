I auditioned for your heart
Play me like a harp
Made me play the part of the fool
I petitioned for your love and attention
You are an addiction I just can't fuel
And you are the air that I breathe
So toxic for me
A pill i was willing to take
But it's silly to pretend so I gotta go and mend
up the heart that I carefully (told?) you to break

I told you to hurt me
Trained you to burn me
Let you desert me, I

You know how to break my heart
You know how to break my heart
And I don't know how you do it
But we try again and then you lie again
You know how to break my heart
You know how to break my heart
But the last time will be the last time I let you break my heart
