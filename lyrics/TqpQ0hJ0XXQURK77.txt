Hey! In her heart there's a hole
There's a black mark on her soul
In her hands is my heart
And she won't let go 'till it's scarred
Ha! Tried to breathe but I can't
'Cause the air she feeds me is damned
Got a touch like a thorn
'Cause the girl she's hiding horns

She got blood cold as ice
And a heart made of stone
But she keeps me alive
She's the beast in my bones
She gets everything she wants
When she gets me alone
Like it's nothing
She got two little horns
And they get me a little bit

She's the fire in the sin
And I burn breathing her in
Now it's love suicide
And I sell my soul for the high
Truth be told I don't mind
'Cause her hand's my paradise
She can crush every hope
Got her heels stomping down my throat

She got blood cold as ice
And a heart made of stone
But she keeps me alive
She's the beast in my bones
She gets everything she wants
When she gets me alone
Like it's nothing
She got two little horns
And they get me a little bit

She got horns like a devil
Pointed at me and there's nowhere to run
From the fire she breathes
She got horns like a devil
Pointed at me and there's nowhere to run
From the fire she breathes
She got horns like a devil
Pointed at me and there's nowhere to run
From the fire she breathes

She got two little horns
And they get me a little bit

She got two little horns
And they get me a little bit
