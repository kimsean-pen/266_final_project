I-llu-mi-na-tion
fire
-tion, fire
-tion, bleeds fire
Illumination bleeds fire
Karmic well of deceit
Blood will nourish
Your (your) sense breeds disgust
Sickened flow
Cauterize my waste
Devoid spirit gone
Our universe will breed
Aeon
ravens descend
Freeze
your destiny
Breathes discord
Fall (Fall),
obsidian tides
Will be nature's bane
