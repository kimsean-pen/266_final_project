Hold no hand, still she pulls you
Don't look back, stills she follows you
As the North Sea screams
You'll cross the boundary
And it feels like nothing feels like

And the cure for death is
Wild and breathless
When you lost more than you'll ever know
Don't die away, don't die away, don't die away

And you'll walk all night
With a wounded hunter's stride
But when she's near you're almost scared
Nothing could be so clear
And you want to stay like a runaway

And the cure for death is
Wild and breathless
When you need more than you'll ever know
Don't die away, don't die away, don't die away

And if she takes
My empty silhouette
We won't let go of the echo for nothing, for no one

And the cure for death is
Wild and breathless
When you need more than you'll ever know
Don't die away, don't die away, don't die away
Don't die away, don't die away, don't die away
Don't die away, don't die away, don't die away
Don't die away, don't die away, don't die away
Don't die away, don't die away, don't die away.
