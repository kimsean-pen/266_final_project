Whenever I look back on the best days of my life
I think I saw them all on TV
I am so homesick now for someone that I never knew
I am so homesick for some place I will never be
Time won't let me go
Time won't let me go
If I could do it all again
I'd go back and change everything
But time won't let me go
I never had a 'Summer of 69'
Never had a Cherry Valance of my own
All these precious moments
You promised me would come in time
So where was I when I missed mine?
Time won't let me go
Time won't let me go
If you gave me back those years
I'd do it all better, I swear
Time won't let me go
If I could go back once again
I would change everything, yeah
If I could go back once again
I'd do it all so much better
Time won't let me go
Time won't let me go
If I could do it all again
I'd go back and change everything
But you won't ever let me go
