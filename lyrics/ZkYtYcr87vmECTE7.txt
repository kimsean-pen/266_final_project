It came like a shotgun wedding
Disguised by vows of lust you made
Thinking the truth might follow
I close my eyes and pray for rain
Oh well
Don't need someone to make me great
Oh well
Don't need

In n out again
It was the best I ever had
In n out again
My life's growing so sad

I was a fiend for a little bit of gold
A foolish tale untold
Never did care then to open up and see
The ones who really loved me
Oh well
Don't need someone to make me great
Oh well
Don't need

In n out again
It was the best I ever had
In n out again
My life's growing so sad

Oh well
Don't need, my life's growing so sad
Oh well
Don't need someone to make me...
