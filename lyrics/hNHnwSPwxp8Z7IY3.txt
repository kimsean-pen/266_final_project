I miss you: but I haven't met you yet
So special: but it hasn't happened yet
You are gorgeous: but I haven't met you yet
I remember: but it hasn't happened yet

And if you believe in dreams
Or what is more important
That a dream can come true
I will meet you

I was peeking: but it hasn't happened yet
I haven't been given: my best souvenir
I miss you: but I haven't met you yet
I know your habits: but wouldn't recognize you yet

And if you believe in dreams
Or what is more important
That a dream can come true
I miss you

I'm so impatient
I can't stand the wait
When will I get my cuddle?
Who are you?
I know by now that you'll arrive
By the time I stop waiting

I miss you
