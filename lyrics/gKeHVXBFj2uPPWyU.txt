oh no! i thought you'd changed; take back all the things you said.
i remember thinking this evidence you left was damning enough
but you took all the words from my mouth and pulled them out.
how could i not see you for what you are?
but you turned all the words from my mouth into doubt.
and i wish i could tear your heart out!

break meter and release, and still the voice it keeps
and i wish that your lungs would give out,
and finally give air to breathe

but i know better now. no words could weed you out
when your back's against the wall, you'll be crying out,

"i'll take all the words from your mouth and leave them out."
and your hands are shaking.
finally, call out!
and the silence breaks your heart, finally.
oh, i almost pity you now (i almost pity you now).
finally, call out!
oh, i almost pity you now.
and i wish i could tear your heart out!

break meter and release, and still the voice that keeps
and i wish for you lungs to give out, finally.
