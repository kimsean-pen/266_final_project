I'm coming out from the shadows
Shooting straight like an arrow
Ain't nothing gonna slow me down, slow me down, yeah
I'm gonna flow like a cool breeze
Stand taller than a palm tree
Ain't nothing gonna cut me down, cut me down, yeah
I remember all the words you said
That a crazy heart can never rest
When your light starts fading out, fading out
Don't keep waiting for an open door
Break the lock and get something more
Make a move 'cause you're alive, alive
We ain't gonna get a second chance
Life ain't nothing but a crazy dance
Learn the moves 'cause you're alive, alive
I never had to go it solo
'Cause your love wrapped me head to toe
All I wanted was to make you proud, make you proud, yeah
I just wanna hold you so close
In return be your rain coat
When the rain wants you drown you out, drown you out, yeah
I remember all the words you said
That a crazy heart can never rest
When your light starts fading out, fading out
Don't keep waiting for an open door
Break the lock and get something more
Make a move 'cause you're alive, alive
We ain't gonna get a second chance
Life ain't nothing but a crazy dance
Learn the moves 'cause you're alive, alive
We're alive, we're alive, we're alive (we're alive)
We're alive, we're alive, we're alive (we're alive)
We're alive, we're alive, oh we're alive, alive
You can always break the rules
You can always dare to dance
But you gotta take a chance, a chance
You can always break the rules
You can always dare to dance
But you gotta take a chance, a chance
Don't keep waiting for an open door
Break the lock and get something more
Make a move 'cause you're alive, alive
We ain't gonna get a second chance
Life ain't nothing but a crazy dance
Learn the moves 'cause you're alive, alive
We're alive, we're alive, we're alive (we're alive)
We're alive, we're alive, we're alive (we're alive)
We're alive, we're alive, oh we're alive, alive
We're alive, we're alive, we're alive-live
We're alive, we're alive, we're alive-live
We're alive, we're alive, oh we're alive, alive
