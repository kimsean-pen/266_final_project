When I reminisce about all those years, I see many things. Life and death
Strung together like the mountains and valleys in which we lived. There was
Wealth and opulence, but also tribulation and loss. There was laughter and
Song, and there was also tears.

But even more than tears, blood was shed. And so many were left to their
Unadorned graves, unburied. But to us, death was but another journey. And
Close by the darkness through which we strode, there was also light. The
Light of life and immortality.

And after all, when I reminisce about those years, I mostly remember our
Songs. We sang... as if to drown out the sound of clashing swords, as if
The battle cries fell silent... because war had lost it's meaning.
