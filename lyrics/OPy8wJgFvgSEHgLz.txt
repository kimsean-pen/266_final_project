You
What you looking at?
Head down
Too late for that

What you want
What you get
Know your place
Don't ever forget

And this is not my face
And this is not my life
And there is not a single thing here
I can recognize

And this is all a dream
And none of you are real
I'd give anything
I'd give anything

Hey you
What you running from?
All your hate
What you've become

Bet you didn't think
It would happen to you
All used up
Half way through

And this is not my face
And this is not my life
And there is not a single thing here
I can recognize

And this is all a dream
And none of you are real
I'd give anything
I'd give anything
You know I'd give anything
