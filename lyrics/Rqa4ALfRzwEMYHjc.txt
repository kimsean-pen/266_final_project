In the morning
On your journey here to the sea
In the mountains
Your shadows beside me

You cross the pasture land
And threw your wedding band
Into the great deep
Where you'd rest to sleep
My dear

In the oceans where you lay
Where you've made your grave
They'll found you on the shore
Rosy no more
My dear

In the morning on your journey here to the sea
You crossed the pasture land
And threw your wedding band
Swallowing the seed
Of truth
