I dream a hundred dreams a minute
And deep inside what I construct
So there's no use, don't even bother
Tonight is not the night for us
I have a million shapes a decade
I'm pass the point of no return
So don't even call, don't even bother
Cause I can make your mind concern

I'm running faster than before
Beats and tunes and lovers
Can not hold me back no more
I work alone
Is this all I'll ever know?

And I remember all my childhood dreams
I find it hard to get them out of my mind
And I remember all my childhood dreams
I find it hard to get them out of my mind
And I remember all my...

So as the night time hits my window
Sudden move to gain the lights
Cause I'm not even close to done yet
Well I won't leave unto in spite
And when the dawn emerges slowly
I realized the night has passed
The suns I made were visionary
Looking forward to go back

I'm running faster than before
Beats and tunes and lovers
Can not hold me back no more
I work alone
Is this all I'll ever know?

And I remember all my childhood dreams
I find it hard to get them out of my mind
And I remember all my childhood dreams
I find it hard to get them out of my mind
Hmm-mmm-mmm

And I remember all my childhood dreams
I find it hard to get them out of my mind
And I remember all my childhood dreams
I find it hard to get them out of my mind
