If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party
Then put your hands up (put your hands up)
(If you wanna party, if, if, if you wanna party)

Then put your hands up (put your hands up)
(You got it, you got it babe)
(You got it, you got it babe)
(You got it, you got it babe)

Sean Don! (You got it, you got it babe) Okay, this, this, this
For my number one girl
Who got the top spot title
Spent an hour in the bathroom
Walked out looking like a model
God! Doing what you do

Got me right there with Apollo on the moon (moon)
Who needs genies in a bottle
Girl, if they already got you
Boy you make me feel so lucky (Got you, I got you)

Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy
To be in love and to give you this heart of mine
You know what I need (ayy)

I know what you like, (ayy)
Put it all together baby, we could be alright (hey)
How could this be wrong
When it feels so right

Yeah, I really love you, I really love you

And I'll never let you go...
You should know
I'm never gonna change
I'm always gonna stay
You call for me
I'm right there (right there)

Right there (right there)
Cause you listen and you care
You're so different
No one compares
And if you never change
I'm gonna stay right there

I'll always be right there
You got it, you got it babe

You got it, you got it babe
I get butterflies, just thinking
About you boy you're on my mind
Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming
Lost in your eyes and I lose all track of time

You know what I need (ayy)
I know what you like, (ayy)
Put it all together baby
We could be alright (hey)

How could this be wrong
When it feels so right
Yeah I really need you, I really love you
And I'll never let you go...

You should know

I'm never gonna change
I'm always gonna stay
You call for me
I'm right there (right there)
Right there (right there)
Cause you listen and you care

It's so different
No one compares
And if you never change
I'm gonna stay right there (What, okay, what)
I'll always be right there
Now if all fell through

Would you catch me before the pavement (what)
If my Benz turned back to public transportation
Would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting (what)
And get my mind back adjacent the place of a young visionary
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary (oh)
My black book and numbers thicker than the dictionary
And Bible I got it recycled
I love and I like you
Five course meals, even though you don't mind a drive-thru
That's why I got you
And I'll never let you go... (I got you)
You should know
I'm never gonna change (I'm never gonna change)
I'm always gonna stay (I'm always gonna stay)
When you call for me
I'm right there (I'm right there)
Right there
Cause you listen and you care
You're so different
No one compares
And if you never change
I'm gonna stay right there
I'll always be right there
(If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party)
You got it, I'll always be right there
(If you wanna party, if if if you wanna party)
I'll always be right there
You got it, you got it babe
You got it, you got it babe
You got it, you got it babe
You got it, you got it babe
Got it babe
