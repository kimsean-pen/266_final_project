Somebody wants to love you

There was something about you
Something out of control
I couldn't take my eyes off you
No, no
I just can't let you go

I don't wanna have to live
Without you by my side
I just need you, I just need you,
I just need you
I just want your body to collide
Next to my side
I just need you, I just need you,
I just need you

Somebody wants to love you
Love, love you
Somebody wants your love,
Your love, your love, your love tonight
Somebody wants your body
Your bo-body
Somebody wants your love,
Your love, your love, your love tonight

Somebody just wanna love you
(Your love, your love, your love tonight)
Somebody just wanna hold you
(Your love, your love, your love tonight)
Somebody just wanna feel you
(Your love, your love, your love tonight)
Somebody wants your love, your love,
Your love, your love tonight

So here's what to discover
Your hands all over me
Don't want no other lover
No, no
Your world can set me free

Somebody wants to love you
Love, love you
Somebody wants your love, your love,
Your love, your love tonight
Somebody wants your body
Your bo-body
Somebody wants your love,
Your love, your love, your love tonight

Collide next to my side
