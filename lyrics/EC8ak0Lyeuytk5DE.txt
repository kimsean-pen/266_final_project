Shake me awake!
Am I the man you see
through your mystery eyes?
Oh yea, I second that emotion

You'll see lightning cascading--
pronouncements of our love

Lady of gold, you would fit beautiful in my wilderness
In your waters I've dropped anchor

You'll see lightning cascading--
pronouncements of our love

Tell me, why do I feel you running away?
