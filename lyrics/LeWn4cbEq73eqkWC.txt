Talk late over pleasantries that never meant much to me
But it was meaning everything to you
A cold pause right before you go
She adores you, run towards you, calls on the landline
That coat wasn't always real you loved just
how the fabric feels but I was somebody else
A boy in a belt who knew tearjerker you are you've been shaking me out
I said one day passes by but I will stay the same

When you look me in the eyes dear
What will you do
When you notice there is nothing
For you to hold on to
Last night I broke down when you Said
I thought you were better than that

Kept my head above the wash now im hoping that we never go back

I stood there on a shallow reef right there beside
the public beach hoping I was something sharks would eat
you said "sugar how you holding up?
" I said "hey my body's gone but im feelin you still"
Always on the move
Ground controller
Beam me up I have enough
ready to lose
How's it going
Hi hello id like to know if there's ever a
day that passes by when I dont stay the same. .

When you look me in the eyes dear
What will you do
When you notice there is nothing
For you to hold on to
Last night I broke down when you Said
I thought you were better than that
Kept my head above the wash now im hoping that we never go back
