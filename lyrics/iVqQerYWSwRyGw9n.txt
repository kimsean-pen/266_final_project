The butterfly effects the bee
By their unity, unity
The kiss of death to you is me
Beautiful allergy, allergy

When general knowledge meets philosophy
And bi-biology, oh bi-biology
Seats for sale for the ma√Ætre d
And I no longer need the ambiguity

Your voice, the noise is missing
Hand trembling in transition

What am I to do
Without chaos?
How to pull through
Without your chaos?

Jaded stem for the garden gate, it tries to pollinate
Tries to pollinate
Sends the drones to the peep and pay
Make the mantis pray
Make the mantis pray

Your voice, the noise is missing
Hand trembling in transition

What am I to do
Without chaos?
How to pull through
Without your chaos?

This light, endure
See-saw
Free pour
Before free thought
Unpredictable

What am I to do
Without chaos?
How to pull through
Without your chaos?
