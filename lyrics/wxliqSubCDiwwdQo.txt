Screaming
Running in delight to face another day
Bleeding
We do our part listen what I say
Calling
To become the woods
The way to be the answer
And falling too
Deeper, ever deeper
Fly higher

Flying
It is drying in a certain way
Never trying too hard to push too far
The art of breathing - slowly
Listen now and listen good
Calling
Higher, ever higher
Go deeper

Would it be ok
To be a part of the solution
Would it be ok
To be a part of the solution

Some say:
'I can never rise from the pit'
So they stay just where they fell
What can I tell
Senseless
It is hard to see and to navigate
Rise up
To rid the cancer from the answer

Would it be ok
To be a part of the solution
Would it be ok
To be a part of the solution

Screaming
To face another day
Bleeding
Listen what I say
Calling
To become the woods
And falling too

Lay of the land
Listen and understand
Lay of the land
Listen and understand

Would it be ok
To be a part of the solution
Would it be ok
To be a part of the solution
