You're tellin me this town ain't got no heart
Well, well, well, you can never tell
The sunny side of the street is dark
Well, well, well, you can never tell
Maybe that's cause it's midnight,
In the dark of the moon besides

Maybe the dark is from your eyes
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
You know you got such dark eyes

Nothin' shakin' on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around

You think you've seen this town clear through
Well, well, well, you can never tell
Nothin' here that could interest you
Well, well, well, you can never tell
It's not because you missed out
On the thing that we had, to start

Maybe you had too much too fast
Maybe you had too much too fast
Maybe you had too much too fast

Nothin' shakin' on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around

Since I'm passing your way today
Well, well, well, you can never tell
I just stopped in cause I want to say
Well, well, well, you can never tell
I recall your darkness
When it crackled like a thundercloud

Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
When I can hear it beat out loud

Nothin' shakin' on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around

Nothin' shakin' on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around
