One Love One Love

Let's go
One Love
Everybody make noise right now

One Love

One love - this is the way we found
One love - even though they'll let you down
One love - nobody's perfect now
One love - don't let that hold you down (break it down)
One love - let's stick together now
One love - we got to stand our ground
One love - it's easy to believe in
One love - believe in you and me

(Here we go Get up Stand up)

One Love

Can anybody help me I'm outta plans
Guess i left my world in somebody's hands (Here we go)
I don't like to hurt but
But everyone gets weak
Someone to rely on
That's what I really need

One love - this is the way we found
One love - even though they'll let you down
One love - nobody's perfect now
One love - don't let that hold you down (break it down)
One love - let's stick together now
One love - we got to stand our ground
One love - it's easy to believe in
One love - believe in you and me

Everybody make noise right now
Make some noise now

One Love

(Eh eh! oh!)
