Come, if you're curious to see
Pull the tricks out of my sleeve
All you find is yours to keep
Brave, are you brave enough to meet
The desires that you seek
Hold my hand, I'll set you free

Welcome to the devil's playground
You can tread where demons play
It's your Candyland where dreamers dance
And I promise that it's safe
Welcome to the devil's playground
You can look and you can touch
It's a real fine day at the black parade
And I swear it won't cost much

Come, pull up your throne and sit
Where good and bad cease to exist
Here your command is our wish
Feast on the fruit of every tree
You can bathe in every dream
These chains of freedom are yours to keep

Welcome to the devil's playground
You can tread where demons play
It's your Candyland where dreamers dance
And I promise that it's safe
Welcome to the devil's playground
You can look and you can touch
It's a real fine day at the black parade
And I swear it won't cost much
