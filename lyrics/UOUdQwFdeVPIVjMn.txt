I'm going to San Bernardino, ring-a-ding-ding
Milkshake mixers, that's my thing, now
These guys bought a heap of my stuff
And I gotta see a good thing sure enough, now

Oh my name's not Kroc, that's Kroc with a K
Like crocodile, but not spelt that way, now
It's dog eat dog, rat eat rat
Kroc style, boom like that

Folks line up all down the street
Now I am seeing this girl devour her meat, now
And then I get it, wham as clear as day
My pulse begins to hammer then I hear a voice say

These boys have got this down
Oughtta be one of these in every town
These boys have got the touch
It's clean as a whistle and it don't cost much

Wham bam, don't wait long
Shake, fries, patty, you're gone
And how about that friendly name
Heck, every little thing oughtta stay the same

Oh my name's not Kroc, that's Kroc with a K
Like crocodile, but not spelt that way, now
It's dog eat dog, rat eat rat
Dog eat dog, rat eat rat
Oh it's dog eat dog, rat eat rat
Kroc style, boom like that

You gentlemen ought to expand
You're gonna need a helping hand, now
So gentlemen, well, what about me?
We'll make a little business history, now

Oh my name's not Kroc, can call me Ray
Like crocodile, but not spelt that way, now
It's dog eat dog, rat eat rat
Kroc style, boom like that

Well, we build it up, and I buy him out
But, man, they made me grind it out, now
They open up a new place, flippin' meat
So I do, too, right across the street

I got the name, I need the town
They sell 'em in the end, and it all shuts down
Sometimes you gotta be an S.O.B.
You wanna make a dream reality

Competition sent 'em south
They're gonna drown, put a hose in their mouth
Do not pass go, go straight to hell
I smell that meat hook smell

Oh my name's not Kroc, that's Kroc with a K
Like crocodile, but not spelt that way, now
Oh it's dog eat dog, rat eat rat
Dog eat dog, rat eat rat, now
Oh, It's dog eat dog, rat eat rat
Kroc style, boom like that
