And it's cold in here when you're all in tears
Your vision is in black and white, you feel so afraid
You fail to show your better half, it's such a shame
Tomorrow's dream never comes, it remains in shades
Remains in shades

Sticks and stones break my bones and it hurts too much
Easy come and easy go, in love and war all seems fair
But's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
Now I am holding ground
Now I am safe and sound

But it's the last straw that breaks my back and life's too short
Handsome is as handsome does and there's so much more
A change is good as rest they say and all that glitters is not gold
Now I am holding ground
Now I am safe and sound

No way I found love sane and sound
And it's cold in here when you're all in tears
Those endless nights of intrigues make it all too clear
In this dark world and wide I am innocent
I am innocent
