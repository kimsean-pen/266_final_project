Smile, feign
Fix until all faces look the same
Hearts so full of fear, and their eyes so full of rain
Born to lose, but I still play the same game
Again and again

Blindside
Love is just a stranger that will pass by
Devils look like angels as they catch my eye
Tell you when, if you can tell me
Why, why?
Why do I try?
I want the stars in your eyes
I'll take the stars from your eyes

Guilt, shame
Sleep until the sunlight fades away
Counting on my fingers 'til there's no one to blame
Different voice, but I still hear the same name
Again and Again

White lies
One last call until we say goodbye
Save these cruel intentions for another night
I'll be there, and I still won't know
Why, why?
Why do I try?
I want the stars in your eyes
I'll take the stars from your eyes

Trace the lines
Anesthetize
In the night
Another scar is left behind
I want the stars in your eyes
I'll take the stars from your eyes

I want the stars in your eyes
I'll take the stars from your eyes

I want the stars in your eyes
I'll take the stars from your eyes
