As I peel away all the years of pain
I've discovered what's been all along
You were so right, I was so wrong

Every shooting star, they all fall so hard
They all fade like a played out song
Now is the time before all lost

I'm coming home
I'm coming home

So I'm coming home
Lost on a road I don't belong
I rest my soul, I'm so alone
Far from the streets I call my own
I'm coming home

Rushing back to me as the city sleeps
So afraid of what I will find
Memories they haunt from deep inside

Every broken man comes to understand
That he'll never find paradise
All that he wants was there all the time

I'm coming home
I'm coming home

So I'm coming home
Lost on a road I don't belong
I rest my soul, I'm so alone
Far from the streets I call my own
And so I'm coming home

Back to a world left long ago
And now I know I'm coming home
I find my way back
I'm letting go, I'm coming home

We've come to find what we take for granted
Keeps us alive in the end
Some done their time
Leave you empty handed
Reach out tonight and make amends

So I'm coming home
Back to the place where I belong
I rest my soul, I'm so alone
Far from the streets I call my own
I'm coming, so I'm coming home

Back to a world left long ago
And now I know I'm coming home
I find my way back, I'm coming home
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
