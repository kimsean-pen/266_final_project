I walk with my head down. I ignore all the faces. Avoiding the cracks onto empty spaces.
Frowning on concrete, my steps lead me blue. I walk with my head down. I ignore all the faces.
Away from the light into dark places. Walking on sidewalks the path casts a gloom.
The sidewalks hide my timid face. The darkness saved me. Fell grom grace. I'll make-do.
