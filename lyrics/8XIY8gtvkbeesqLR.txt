Enjoy it
Might as well enjoy it while we're here (ah)
We went too far into the dark to go back
Almost ruined my heart

Got my feeling back inside
Feeling back inside
Feeling so alive
Got my feeling back inside
Feeling back inside
Feeling so alive tonight

We ain't gotta be nowhere
'Cause nowhere got us here
Yo keep it down
Don't chase the crowd
We ain't gotta be nowhere
'Cause nowhere got us here
Yo keep it down
Don't chase the crowd

Take over
Let all the madness disappear (I'm so high)
I said take over
You control your atmosphere

Got my feeling back inside
Feeling back inside
Feeling so alive
Got my feeling back inside
Feeling back inside
Feeling so alive tonight

We ain't gotta be nowhere
'Cause nowhere got us here
Yo keep it down
Don't chase the crowd
We ain't gotta be nowhere
'Cause nowhere got us here
Yo keep it down
Don't chase the crowd

We ain't got the time to chase the past into tomorrow
We ain't got the time, let's make it last until forever
We ain't got the time to chase the past into tomorrow
We ain't got the time, let's make it last until forever

Got my feeling back inside
Feeling back inside
Feeling so alive
Got my feeling back inside
Feeling back inside
Feeling so alive

Got my feeling back inside
Feeling back inside
Feeling so alive
Got my feeling back inside
Feeling back inside
Feeling so alive tonight
