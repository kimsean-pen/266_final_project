You cover the road holes before I stumble
Lead me through those fields of traps
The road ahead it starts to crumble
You build bridges over gaps

But when I fall I'm gonna hit the ground
Have to get up on my own
Cause you run to hold my head
and get on the wrong side of me instead

You let it rain before I start a fire
Always the right tools in your hand
It's your words of love I desire
Sadness you don't understand

Cause when I fall I'm gonna hit the ground
Have to get up on my own
Cause you run to hold my head
and get on the wrong side of me instead

Picking up picking up pieces on my own
You don't know you don't know I'm scared to be alone

Cause when I fall I'm gonna hit the ground
Have to get up on my own
Cause you run to hold my head
and get on the wrong side of me instead
