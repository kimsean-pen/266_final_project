Will you tear it down
Will you decide
We put up a fight for the other side
We raise up our arms to show we're strong
Then we break our bones, but we'll carry on

All that you see
Do you want to be
Adversity
All that you see
Do you want to be
You and me
Adversity

Oh, the clouds are moving in
Oh, we're all so new to this

All that you see
Do you want to be
Adversity
All that you see
Do you want to be
You and me

Adversity

All that you see
Adversity
All that you see
You and me

All that you see
Adversity
All that you see
You and me
Adversity
