Can you feel it, feel it, feel it
In your soul?
Can you tell me
Tell me if it's hot or cold?

Can you tell me
What it is?
Does it hurt you
When I do this?

Stop it, stop it, stop it
You're pulling too hard
Stop it
You're going too far

Can you tell me
What it is?
Does it hurt you
When I do this?

Can you tell me
What it is?
Does it hurt you
When I do this?

I love it, I hate it, I love it
I hate it too
I love it, I hate it, I love it
So how about you?

Can you tell me
'Cause I don't know
Why don't you tell me
Why is it so confusing?
