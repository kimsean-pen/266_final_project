Here it comes again, out of the rain.
Seems to have a new kind of same.
Been playin' on a simple ride,
The sign comes alive and speaks the mind.

It turns to me and it turns to gold.
It turns to see the fast lane slow.

It's been away too long,
It's been away, I'm gone.
East coast and on, to the west star.

Lookin' out, I thought I saw you blink.
Coming on to me like a silver eye.

Pick it up and tune it on in,
Head on out to western starland.

It's been mad and gone, now it's singing a song.
Like a western star, it's going my way.

Looking out, I'm back in time to stay.
Into the eastern, sign away.

It comes alive through the clearer,
The ghost arrives into your mirror.

You've been away too long,
It's been way too long.
Eastern star is on, a disappearer.
