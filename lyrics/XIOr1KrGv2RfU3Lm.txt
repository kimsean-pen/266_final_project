This morning
I woke up on the floor
Thinking I have never dreamed before
And in the afternoon
The nagging thought
That I have never lived or else forgot

I tell you stories
But truth be told
I can't remember
What came before
That's how I know
That's how I know
And I am brand new
And not so whole
That's how I know

On paper
I'm waving with a grin
Proof of places I have never been
So I pull you forward towards this spot
That I have never seen or else forgot

I show you pictures
Of this very corner
But I can't remember
Who pushed the shutter
I have no answer
You say "No matter"
My only memory
Is coming home
That's how I know

This morning
I woke up on the floor
Thinking I have never dreamed before
