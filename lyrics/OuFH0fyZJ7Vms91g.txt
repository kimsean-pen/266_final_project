You don't need much money to ride the silver train
Just enough to keep yourself from sleeping in the rain
Satellites are chasing silver clouds away and
Technicolor raindrops wash gumballs down the drain

Gonna leave the city, gonna hop a train tonight
Gotta one-way ticket and the moon is shining bright
Gonna leave the city, gonna catch the Hudson Line
'cause you know I love the city but I haven't got the time

Satellites are chasing the silver clouds away
Mercury's are falling, yeah, who forgot to pray
Silver trains will whistle and glisten by the moon
Molly has her kite and Joe has his balloons
Satellites are chasing silver clouds away
I'm stuck on the tracks to sleep away the day

Gonna leave the city, gonna hop a train tonight
Gotta one-way ticket and the moon is shining bright
Gonna leave the city, gonna catch the Hudson Line
'cause you know I love the city but I haven't got the time
