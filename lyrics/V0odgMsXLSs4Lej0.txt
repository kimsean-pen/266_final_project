I don't care
If only I could say that
And not feel so sick and scared
And I don't care
If only I could say that
If only my eyes would close

Jesus brilliant
You used to laugh
Walking these gorgeous blocks
This top is the place
Where nobody goes
You just imagine
You just imagine it all

Every day I lie here
And know that it's true
All I really want is you
Please come back
Please come back
Like all the other ones do

Jesus brilliant
You used to laugh
Walking these gorgeous blocks
This top is the place
Where nobody goes
You just imagine
You just imagine it all

Please come back
Please come back
All of you
Please come back
Please come back
All of you
