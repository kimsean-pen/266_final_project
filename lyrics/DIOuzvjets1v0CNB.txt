On your back look on to me, you'll see genocide
Face from death more than insane, profane pleading cries
Watch you die inside
Watch you die

God send death end misery
Preach no love of ministry
Pray for sin a shattered faith
Down on your knees, you're screaming out to die

Death is overdue
Nothing can save you
A morbid symphony
Hearing you lie there screaming

Taking life from you
Is all I wanna do
Desire so deranged
This is what lives inside me

Putrid blood flows through my veins to thrive on demise
Voyeurs' lust watching the pain, touching you inside
Bleed you fucking dry
Bleed on me

Death's design blood splattered wall
Face melting one vicious whore
Twisted figures flesh from bone
Down on your knees, you're screaming out to die

Death is overdue
Nothing can save you
A morbid symphony
Hearing you lie there screaming

Taking life from you
Is all I wanna do
Desire so deranged
This is what lives inside me

Clawing at the eyes of God
You taste your death in hand
Your fingers bleed in vain
Your scream in your grave

Clawing at the eyes of God
You pierce your throat and hands
You've gone insane with pain
Your blind screaming for your god
Pathetic god

Death's design blood splattered wall
Face melting one vicious whore
Twisted figures, drown your mind in pain

God send death end misery
Preach no love of ministry
Pray for sin a shattered faith
Down on your knees, you're screaming out to die

Clawing at the eyes of God
