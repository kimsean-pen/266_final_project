See you find comfort in small things
Which she considers the wrong things
And you find comfort in hellos
Not goodbyes, not goodbye

And you try not to have issues
With the hate you love you and miss yous
That all come out when she kissed you
Goodbye goodbye

Singing sweet Caroline with diamonds in her eyes
And you can't remember the tune

Throw my arms to the skies
Hold my head make me realise
Close my eyes let me reset
Happiness in retrospect

Make it chill make it flow
Everything in the afterglow
Let me go and I'll forget
Happiness in retrospect

See you find comfort in tall things
Which he considers the wrong things
And you find comfort in things he can't
Recognise recognise

And you want nothing but all this
While he's stuck trying to solve it
Nevertheless acquiesce till you feel those
Butterflies butterflies

Singing sweet Caroline with diamonds in his eyes
And you can't remember the tune

Throw my arms to the skies
Hold my head make me realise
Close my eyes let me reset
Happiness in retrospect

Make it chill make it flow
Everything in the afterglow
Let me go and I'll forget
Happiness in retrospect

(Instrumental interlude)

Throw my arms to the skies
Hold my head make me realise
Close my eyes let me reset
Happiness in retrospect

Make it chill make it flow
Everything in the afterglow
Let me go and I'll forget
Happiness in retrospect

Let me go and I'll forget
Happiness in retrospect
