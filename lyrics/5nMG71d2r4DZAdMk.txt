Calling out miracles
Abandoned homes lost in the flood
Wading waters, first responders
And our days are bleached in blood

Rip my heart out and throw it in the ocean
(Writing our names in the crimson sand)

Maybe I'll just disappear, whoa
At least, that's what I believe
Not sure where we all go
I just know we all leave
We all leave

We walk in circles in search of moments
That blur our vision and keep us strong
Out the poison and in the season
Fading romance in the sun

Rip my heart out and throw it in the ocean
(Writing our names in the crimson sand)

Maybe I'll just disappear, whoa
At least, that's what I believe
Not sure where we all go
I just know we all leave
We all leave

Rip my heart out
Throw it away
Rip my heart out
Throw it away

Rip my heart out and throw it in the ocean
(Write our names in the crimson sand)
Ril my heart out and throw it in the ocean
(Write our names in the crimson sand)

Maybe I'll just disappear, whoa
At least, that's what I believe
Not sure where we all go
I just know we all leave
Maybe I'll just disappear, whoa
At least, that's what I believe
Not sure where we all go
I just know we all leave
We all leave
