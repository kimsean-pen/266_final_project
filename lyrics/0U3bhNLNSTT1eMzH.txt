Every night, every day, I tell my heart to forget you and to
Move away, not to break anymore, but oh, no matter
What I say, you're so deep in my mind
There's no way to leave this love behind

It used to be, I believed, I could go on and find someone to
Rest upon anyone, soon I found, there was no other
There you are, framed against the sky
You are my life and I pray for when you will be mine to love again

I see the rain in the sky
And I see your face through every tear that I cry
With every breath and every sound
I can hear another voice and swear that
You're around and every word is clear
'Cause I know the memory won't let go
Until you're mine, to love again

Who's to say what lives in the past?
Who's to say that love won't last?
Time's been standing still, waiting so patiently until
Until that one day when, when I will have you to love again

And there you are, framed against the sky
You are my life and I pray for when
You will be mine, to love again
