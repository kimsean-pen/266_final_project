She puts her pen to paper
Lines across their hearts
You did it all to raise her
You left her standing in the dark

This time she's praying for silence
Hoping that you would understand
That she's just building these roadworks
So that it's clearer when they land

You can't still own what you let go
What don't you understand?

Tough luck I said I'd be here in a month but you waited two
Only coming back round because you heard I was with someone new
And I was waiting here till you came back
My heart was bleeding black
It's tough love that I'm giving you
Yeah, it's tough luck on you

He asked a question, she answers
He made a crossword spelling guilt
Empty boxes filled with chances
But you can't just leave the rose to wilt

You can't still own what you let go
What don't you understand?

Tough luck I said I'd be here in a month but you waited two
Only coming back round because you heard I was with someone new
And I was waiting here till you came back
My heart was bleeding black
It's tough love that I'm giving you
Yeah, it's tough luck on you

Tough luck I said I'd be here in a month but you waited two
Only coming back round because you heard I was with someone new
And I was waiting here till you came back
My heart was bleeding black
It's tough love that I'm giving you
It's tough luck on you
