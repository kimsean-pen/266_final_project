I don't look for trouble, trouble looks for me
That's how it's always been, that's how it's gonna be
I'm looking down on you, you're looking up to me
I never saw you coming, you never saw me

I can't explain who I am
'Cause there's no excuses, this is who I'm meant to be
There's no regrets
I don't care if you believe
There's no excuses, this is who I choose to be
I don't look for trouble
Trouble looks for me

Does it confuse you? I fuckin' used you
I got just what I want and what I wanna do
You won't destroy me, you just annoy me
I'm sitting here on top, so fuck your trophy

I can't explain who I am
'Cause there's no excuses, this is who I'm meant to be
There's no regrets
I don't care if you believe
There's no excuses, this is who I choose to be
I don't look for trouble
Trouble looks for me
Get some!

'Cause there's no excuses, this is who I'm meant to be
There's no regrets
I don't care if you believe
There's no excuses, this is who I choose to be
I don't look for trouble
Trouble looks for me
Trouble looks for me
