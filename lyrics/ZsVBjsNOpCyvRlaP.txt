There's no one around
To unseal my fate
Lift me off the ground
Before it's all too late
Am I just a girl
Who fell from the sky
Am I just an answer
Waiting for a question why

Now I'm searching for you
But nothing is in sight
Take me from the shadows
Bring me to the light

Nomansland
Will there be no end
To this Nomansland
No one to hear me
Nobody here but me
