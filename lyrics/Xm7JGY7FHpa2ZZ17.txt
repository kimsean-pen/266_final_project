In the night
I hear their voices calling
They seem to speak my name

Glowin' bright
I see the eyes of demons
Reaching out beyond the grave

And I... Think from Hell they came
Oh! I... Think from Hell they came
Think from Hell they came
Oh! I... Think from Hell they came

Dark the night
Their cries so lonely
Feel their need inside

I can't fight
This eternal longing
Feast of flesh these ghouls tonight...

And I... Think from Hell they came
Oh! I... Think from Hell they came
Think from Hell they came
Oh! I... Think from Hell they came

In the night
I hear their voices calling
They seem to speak my name

Glowin' bright
I see the eyes of demons
Reaching out beyond the grave

And I... Think from Hell they came
Oh! I... Think from Hell they came
Think from Hell they came
Oh! I... Think from Hell they came.
