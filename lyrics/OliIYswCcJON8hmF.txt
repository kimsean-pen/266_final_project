i can hear them
speaking in the next room
as they drink and start
losing control and get louder
they wonder about me
i can hear her
twirling the ice with her finger
she's got that
half dead look in her eyes by now
she worries about me

he's not like the other boys
around here
he says nothing and sits in his
room and he's afraid to
and he's afraid to drive a car
so sad he is

it's our duty
as we're respected
it's our duty
as californians
to show him new life

ever since my staying i've been
having bad dreams
so stop eating cabbage and stop
talking to that girl
what are the winters like here?

hush up and play the piano

but have i told you how i love her?
yes but you're aquarius
and she is capricorn
come come now and meet
your cousins from l.a.
shut up and leave me alone

we know who you are
i read your palm while you
were sleeping
and i read through your diary
and the secrets you've been keeping
we were already aware of
and now for dinner and maybe
tomorrow we'll have a drink
and talk this over
and in the meantime please
think of the good things
we've done for you

it's our duty
as we're respected
it's our duty
as californians
to show him new life
