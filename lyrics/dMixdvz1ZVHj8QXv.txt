Haven't shaved for days
Keeps the appearance of delay
The luxury of one more dye
Pretend humility, the ugly lie
I would prefer no choice
One bread, one milk, one food, that's all
I'm confused, I only want one truth
I really don't mind being lied to

It's not "What's wrong?"
it's "What's right?"
Makes you feel like I'm talking a
foreign language sometimes
it's not "What's wrong?"
it's "What's right?"
it's the facts of life sunshine
it's the facts of life sunshine
it's the facts of life my sunshine
