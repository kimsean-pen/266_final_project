I don't have to leave anymore, what I have is right here
Spend my nights and days before, searching the world for what's right here

Underneath and unexplored, islands and cities I have looked
Here I saw, something I couldn't over look

I am yours now, so now I don't ever have to leave
I've been found out, so now I'll never explore

See what I've done, that bridge is on fire, yeah, that's the way I've been
I'm froze by desire, no need to leave

Where would I be?, if this were to go under that's a risk I'd take
I'm froze by desire, as if a choice I'd make

I am yours now, so now I don't ever have to leave
I've been found out, so now I'll never explore

I am yours now (I am yours now), so now I don't ever have to leave (ever have to leave)
I've been found out (I've been found out), so now I'll never explore

So now I'll never explore
