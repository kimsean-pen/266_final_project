The road is pulling me into her open web
And for a moment I escape and I forget
The silhouettes behind the dust clouds call me friend
But even fools know here they're far a few between
She has abandoned me on highways and desert plates
Of lonely creatures singing for the summer rain
And at the end of all your knees fall down to me
Yeah it's something in you always ask for someone real

Oh I need your love, I need your love
I need you now, I need you
Oh I need your love, I need your love
I need you now, I need you

She is my salvation in the dark
But at night with lips of honey calls the devil's heart
And I am a war of flesh and heart that's left undone
Between the person that I was and have become

Oh I need your love, I need your love
I need you now, I need you
Oh I need your love, I need your love
I need you now
I need your love

Oh I need your love, I need your love
I need you now, I need you
Oh I need your love, I need your love

I need you now
There's no resting in my heart
There's no resting in my heart
There's no resting now
There's no resting in my heart
There's no resting in my heart
There's no resting on the one, your love
