(Vs.1)
The day seems so very long
But I'm trying to be strong
(Trying to be strong)
Well, hold on, I say
Things will soon turn my way
And then I'll have a clear view
But I gotta keep

(Chorus)
Keep your head to the sky
I don't need to tell you why
Keep your head to the sky
I don't need to tell you why

(Vs.2)
I sometimes get worried
And I wonder why I worry
Cause I know that I will make it through the storm
I'm tryin not to lose my cool
Because if in this world I do
The only person that's gonna miss out on everything is me
And I gotta keep

(Chorus)

oooh, ooh
oh, ooh, oh
Keep your head up
Don't you look down for nobody
Don't you do it, don't you do it
Keep your head

(Chorus)
Everyday's a struggle
But struggling to be
Is very hard, so very hard
Because I'm out here trying to do the right thing
And when I look around here's the wrong thing
Tempting me to make me disagree
About how I feel about me
But I gotta keep

(Chorus)
