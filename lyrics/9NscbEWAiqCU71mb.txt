White hot morning
The blinding light of day holds sway
Barefoot yawning
Wipe the night out from my eyes

It's slowly dawning
Summer town's a merry-go-round
The stakes get risen daily
In every way there's more to pay

And I'm not searching for these changes
They just slip by me everyday
And everything needs rearranging
And you're the one to make it stay

Glass clear morning, it's blowin' cool outside today
Without warning the crowds all meet across the street
Pay phone calling, down the square the people stare
This daily planet's beauty lies behind untutored eyes

And I'm not searching for these changes
They just slip by me everyday
And everything needs rearranging
And you're the one to make it stay

Cool morning
Cool morning

White hot morning
The blinding light of day holds sway
Barefoot yawning
Wipe the night out from my eyes

It's slowly dawning
Summer town's a merry-go-round
Without a watch you get to know
The time is right for crime

And I'm not searching for these changes
They just slip by me everyday
And everything needs rearranging
And you're the one to make it stay

Cool morning
Cool morning
