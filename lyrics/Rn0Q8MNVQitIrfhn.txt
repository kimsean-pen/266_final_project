Ex-ting called me a piece of shit
All I do is come through, beat and dip
Been going on like this for weeks
I don't really know what week this is
Got a new flame that love to speak
I'm not really on that speaking shit
Flip my lid (flip)
Flip my lid (flip)
Oh my lord, that's that Jord (drop)
Look at that hoe, doing the most
Less is more (boo)
Getting all close I don't want that though
So I tell her 'Hoe back up cus'
Even the ex then texting but I don't want no catch up cus
Better pay me respect ('spect)
I just need my space (space)
Man are coming like thief's (thief's)
That's why I carve my own lane (ay)
Man are trying to be good
Me I'm trying to be great
Man they move like an ex
That's why you hear them all hate
Living life to the max is a minimal
You don't like the literal
Let's just get to physical
Your wedding rings invisible
Girl you smoking like a medicinal

She's getting richer that's the ritual
Said I'm such a sinner
Man that's cynical
Said I call her back I was in the call
But in reality I was in the mall
I call her back when dinner calls
Said her friend was into Jord's
Said that that was in the clause
Said that I'll speak on his behalf
He ain't into talk
She gave me top but she hit the floor
Can always tell when they've been abroad
20+ yeah I'm into Spurs
Ikea yeah I'm into drawers
Guess what girl I'm into yours
I do my ting with no pillowtalk
Man I kill the pussy you can bring the chalk
Outline that
Girl I'm fine imma whine that
So lost imma find that
Bellerin I'll be right back
Bell her in I'll be right back
I'll be right back
Bellerin
