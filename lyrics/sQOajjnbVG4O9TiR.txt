I'm putting this night down to bed
'Cause I was sitting at the bar
Hoping you'd walk in the door that says Killian's red
'Cause I left you a note that said
Come on out and we'll both get right off of our heads
And float up off the chair
We'll go on vacation tonight
Under a sun of neon light
And I almost love this town when I'm by your side

You woke me from a long sleep and I'm almost back
Closer than ever to finding the hidden track
If I told you the truth you wouldn't like what I said
I almost believed I was dead
There'll be no more waiting
You're gonna melt all the ice in my head
There'll be no more crying
You're gonna make it all better instead

I'm putting this night down to bed
'Cause I was sitting at the bar
Hoping you'd walk in the door that says Killian's red
'Cause I left you a note that said
Come on out and we'll both get right off of our heads
And float up off the chair
I get secrets at night
But they don't stay
I get secrets at night
But they go away
We'll go on vacation tonight
Under a sun of neon light
And I almost love this town when I'm by your side

You woke me from a long sleep and I'm almost back
Closer than ever to finding the hidden track
If I told you the truth you wouldn't like what I said
