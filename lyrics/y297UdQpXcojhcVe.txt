We all wait patiently
? the first time
As we are born, we dream
Everyone will run, will jump, will laugh
Piece by piece, the seam begins to crack
Stock up and run
Like a magazine
Sixteen on a wicked Friday
Sex songs and gasoline
Down on the coast
I'll win her heart
Sunsets and summer Sunday
Hands go up in her bra
Ohh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh.
She's so unforgettable
Ohh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh.
Sixteen and an all American
Follow me close
It's gonna be a long way to travel through life
And knowing that it's so illogical
Steady it goes
It's going to be a hard one to see what you find
I know that it's so illogical
We are alive
Siting now awake
Sixteen on a panic Monday
Small dress on the interstate
Get so excited
Sound of a gun
Ride out with the racing jacket
On highway 101
Ohh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh.
Oh... oh... oh... oh...
Ohh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh.
Oh... oh... oh... oh...
Ohh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh.
She's so unforgettable
Ohh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh.
Sixteen and an all American
Follow me close
It's gonna be a long way to travel through life
And knowing that it's so illogical
Steady it goes
It's going to be a hard one to see what you find
I know that it's so illogical
Follow me close
It's gonna be a long way to travel through life
And knowing that it's so illogical
Steady it goes
It's going to be a hard one to see what you find
I know that it's so illogical
Follow me close
It's gonna be a long night if you're going to high
And knowing that it's so illogical
Steady it goes
It's going to be a fun one to see what you find
I know that it's so illogical
