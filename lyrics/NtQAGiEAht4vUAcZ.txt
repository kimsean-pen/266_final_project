When I was young
I collected my heroes
When I was young
I was a star amongst zeroes
But then I grew up
And now I'm heading up river
I'm gonna cover myself in mud, mud
Yeah I'm 'a deliver

Never can believe how much fun we're having,
Can't believe how much fun we're having,
Never can believe how much fun we're having

When I was young
Yeah I used to believe it
That the stars in the night sky
Were suns that refused to sink
And then I sank

Never can believe how much fun we're having,
Can't believe how much fun we're having,
Never can believe how much fun we're having

Never can believe how much fun we're having,
Can't believe how much fun we're having,
Never can believe how much fun we're having

Never can believe how much fun we're having,
Can't believe how much fun we're having,
Never can believe how much fun we're having
