The trophy that I made for us
In fur and gold
Got into the wrong pair of hands
In truth was sold
They bought it for oh so much less
Than it was worth
And every man that touched it
Found a heaven on earth
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms

The queens and the court jesters
Clapped, adored
Their hearts swelled to
Overdrive and mercy soared
Mercy this and mercy that
Let justice prevail
But I just want my trophy back
It's not for sale
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms

Creatures of mercy
Shoot shoot
Shoot them down
And set me free

Creatures of mercy
Shoot shoot
Shoot them down
And set me free

When I got my trophy back
It took some time
To polish it, to go from black
And shoot the lion
When I put it back inside
I locked the door
A trophy of mercy
Is a trophy no more
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms

Creatures of mercy
Shoot shoot
Shoot them down
And set me free

Creatures of mercy
Shoot shoot
Shoot them down
And set me free
