Tragic
Everybody trying to hide all of those habits
It's kinda bizarre when it's who you are

It's tragic that it's come to this
I bury all of my vices
Trying to keep my head up over it
When everything's whatever

It's the be all, end all
And right before we fade away
Call a spade a spade
And you should know
You can tell it's a

Bittersweet world
Why can't we all just get along in this
Bittersweet world
Everybody reaping what they sow in this
Sweet world

Whatever happened to the magic that was keeping us
The faith that was beyond stardust
Now these hypocrites pointing fingers
With three fingers pointing right back

And all we're left with is
And all we're left with is
And all we're left with is
And all we're left with is
The foolish pride and the quick fixes

It's the be all, end all
And right before we fade away
Call a spade a spade
And you should know
You can tell it's a

Bittersweet world
Why can't we all just get along in this
Bittersweet world
Everybody reaping what they sow in this
Bittersweet world
With closes full of skeletons, I'm a
Bittersweet girl
Demons out to get me as I stand alone

There's a universe bottom line
Everybody's in disguise, even you and I
Behind the façade trying to get by
Don't wanna burn but wanna play with fire

Again

There's a universe bottom line
Everybody's in disguise, even you and I
Behind the façade trying to get by
You wanna play with fire you're gonna get burned

It's the be all, end all
And right before we fade away
Call a spade a spade
And you should know
You can tell it's a

It's the be all, end all
And right before we fade away
Call a spade a spade
And you should know
You can tell it's a

Bittersweet world
Why can't we all just get along in this
Bittersweet world
Everybody reaping what they sow in this
Bittersweet world
With closes full of skeletons, I'm a
Bittersweet girl
Demons out to get me as I stand alone
