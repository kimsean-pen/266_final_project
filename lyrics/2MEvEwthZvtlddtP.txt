You always see the beauty in a passing cloud
You're the one who fixes me when I'm down
And you don't think twice, do you?
You could find one diamond in a mine
But you're the one who's shining from miles around
And you don't see that, do you?

And when the day is done
Do you have the feeling?
That you're all alone
Giving up on your own dreams

Hey you, it's your turn to
See the beauty in yourself
Just like you tell everyone else
Hey you, am I getting through?
If you would only see yourself
The way you see everyone else
The way I always see you
I see you, hey you, hey you

If you fly like Icarus to the edge
I could be there talking you back
Don't forget, don't got there, do you?

And when the night is long
Do you wake up hearing
A voice inside
Calling out for your dreams

Hey you, it's your turn to
See the beauty in yourself
Just like you tell everyone else
Hey you, am I getting through?
If you would only see yourself
The way you see everyone else
The way I always see you
I see you, hey you

Hiding in the background
Thinking you're not pretty
Holding back your thoughts
'Cause who's gonna listen?
Hiding behind a half smile
Hey, it's such a pity
Everybody's missing out
While you're busy
Holding it all inside, inside

Hey you, it's your turn to
See the beauty in yourself
Just like you tell everyone else
Hey you, am I getting through?
If you would only see yourself
The way you see everyone else
The way I always see you
I see you, hey you
What you're gonna do?
