"Far away from any road,
Froze my heart in solitude,
Where your passerby can see,
Our life's highway guard within,
Knowing when our last does fail,
Our compassion shall be met,
...
Our life's highway guard within."

We need vices (oh),
We need vices (oh),
Well you took my hope and my marriage license,
(where's my home?)

Those days are dead
(forgive me)
Those days are dead
(forgive me)
Those days are dead
(forgive me)
We need vices at fifty thousand degrees

She said goodbye to the ground
She said goodbye to the ground
She said goodbye to the ground
I don't care

I got creative (oh no),
To try to kill the major,
Where is my trigger?
...

And that forest burned
That forest burned
That forest burned
We need ten years, everyone, so we can return

She said goodbye to the ground
She said goodbye to the ground
She said goodbye to the ground
She said goodbye to the ground
She said goodbye to the ground
And jumped

We need vices (oh),
We need vices (oh),
We've done nothing but brandish our disguises

Those days are dead
(forgive me)
Those days are dead
(forgive me)
Those days are dead
(forgive me)
We need vices to wave to the good old days

She said goodbye to the ground
She said goodbye to the ground
She said goodbye to the ground
And jumped
