I've been running laps at the track at my old school
I've been running past all the has-been, too soon
The jersey on the wall, where you been, what you up to?
Too long to get through
I've been wearing all-black hats, got a tattoo
Wanna know where you're at, but I'm too afraid to ask you
A smile and a laugh and it's back to your old news
You still remember my name when you're famous and too cool

Real name, what's your real name?
You can be whatever you want to and it's all your stage
Real names chasing lose change
Oh, you'll never know where it takes you, but you can't stay

Staring at the frames, nothing changed in my old room
The music never left, but I guess that I had to
Spiral on the wall, where you been, where you from, dude?
It's been too long, too long

Real name, what's your real name?
You can be whatever you want to and it's all your stage
Real names chasing lose change
Oh, you'll never know where it takes you, but you can't stay

All my friends know just who I am
And if you don't know what, don't just pretend
All my friends know just who I am
And if you don't know what, don't just be friends

Real name, what's your real name?
You can be whatever you want to and it's all your stage
Real names chasing lose change
Oh, you'll never know where it takes you, but you can't stay

It's so strange when you can't stay in the same place
Catch me riding upon that wave
When you get trace, I won't wait
I'll keep trying to fight mine
All my friends, all my friends
I just keep trying to fight mine
All my friends
All my friends know just who I am
