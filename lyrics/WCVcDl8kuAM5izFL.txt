If this is the epitome of our species
I can't see the forest for the trees
If we don't heal before we realise
The scale of the problem within
Tell me that you're okay not knowing
Will you fall into the ether with me?
If only we could feel complete without it
Will you let it in?

To the west, to the west, economy before acceptance
A worth over intelligence, we all can be accepted in hell
If we're going nowhere, you know that they don't care
We are the symptoms of a careless empire

Disorder; your web swings catching everything
As far as I can see
We are draped in the diminishing
But nothing's as it seems

To the west, to the west, economy before acceptance
A worth over intelligence, we all can be accepted in hell
If we're going nowhere, you know that they don't care
We are the symptoms of a careless empire

We've been grazed by the outbreak
We've been nettled by the fakes, snakes and mistakes and time again we've shown

You can't even wait till the dust has settled
Run straight with your head down from the battle
Are you safe jumping in a grave you can't dig yourself out of?
Why'd you have to wait till the warning comes in avalanche form?
Should've put your hands up, but you thought you better point the blame
Either way, it points back, and you can't escape

If this is the epitome of our species
I can't see the forest for the trees
If we don't heal before we realise
The scale of the problem within

And if I inspire you, you inspire me
We're breaking the mould together, you set me free
I inspire you, you inspire me
We're breaking the mould together, you set me free

To the west, to the west, economy before acceptance
A worth over intelligence, we all can be accepted in hell
If we're going nowhere, you know that they don't care
We are the symptoms of a careless empire
