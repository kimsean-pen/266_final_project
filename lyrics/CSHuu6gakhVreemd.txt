I long for the trip I don't need no grip I'm takin' one more ride
Way out there in the prairie air I guess it's in my hide
For the clickety clack of the railroad track is callin'
If a man can know where the Santa Fe goes when she gets under steam
And the big loud bell that bongs farewell could hear her whistle scream
He's bound to go where there ain't no snow a-fallin'
One more ride
One more ride

I miss the gloom of the prairie moon that seemed to know my name
And the tumbleweed where the prairie dogs feed I miss them just the same
They're all a part of a song of heart I'm sayin'
I recall the tune that I sang to the moon and it seemed to make it smile
And I rode away at the close of the day and I stayed so long awhile
But I long to be where the memory is ringing
One more ride
One more ride

As the years go by I wonder why I longed to leave my home
And to hit the trail of the iron rail way out there alone
But my heart would sigh 'til I know that I am leavin'
If I don't come back on a one-way track way down from Mexico
You can find me there or any old where that a tumbleweed will grow
It's goodbye now you'll never know how I'm grievin'
One more ride
One more ride
