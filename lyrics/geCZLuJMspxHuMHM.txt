This dream of fullness
This fleeting glimpse
The wind blowing through the trees
Red rising sun
Hues of the living
The gasp of the dying
Water mixes with blood
Blood mixes with earth
The earth a silent witness
Witness to the dawn

Call of Atma
Shining in all
Awakened
To the call

Burning within
From what must be
Desire of the one
Water mixes with blood
Blood mixes with earth
The earth
A witness
To the call

Burning within
From what must be
The desire of the one
To be witnessed
