There is no operation
Doctor Mess goes flagrant
Till' he makes you leggo yo eggo
They schemin', bottom-feeding
Robbin' them cribs
Don't let them veterinarians
Close to your kids

Don't fight, it's too magnetic
Did this dude just did this?
Space blood done made you an addict
Now I done gone through these body bags

You've got me begging for an answer
Indecision's cancer
Waiting at your beck and call

I don't know how long I can take it
Trying to read your body language
Only got you moving back and forth

Let's make this dinner a classic
Cook up some breakfast and bounce

How long, how long, do I got, do I gotta wait?
I'm begging time to move faster
Suspended in this disaster

Cancel my pride for an ounce, for an ounce of faith
I'm begging time to move faster
Suspended in this disaster

Over and over
Over and over you're complicated
Over and over I'm fascinated
Frustrated

Let's make this dinner a classic
Cook up some breakfast and bounce

How long, how long, do I got, do I gotta wait?
I'm begging time to move faster
Suspended in this disaster

Cancel my pride for an ounce, for an ounce of faith
I'm begging time to move faster
Suspended in this disaster

Don't fight, it's too magnetic
Did this dude just did this?
Space blood done made you an addict
Now I done gone through these body bags
