It's not a secret
I am not myself
I no longer know my name
I've been locked in that game
Tell me are you scared?
I search for fame
I feel so ashamed
Easy to manipulate
You are trapped in my game
Tell me are you scared?

But when I try
Try so hard
I'm falling apart
Feeling alive
When they die
He's always in my mind
But when I cry
With my heart
I'm choosing the night
Feeling alive
When you die
He's always in my mind

I sold my soul to the devil
I cannot help myself, I fall
I'm wondering if I die
If you die, if we die
Will I cry today?
I sold my soul to the devil
I cannot help myself, I fall
I'm wondering if I die
If you die, if we die
Will I cry today?
I sold my soul to the devil

This is unfair to think
I should be dead
I am trying to make this end
Cause he's feeding my pain
Tell him I'm so scared
I hear them say
Please stop digging that grave
I cannot control my hands
It's like a mist in my head
Tell him I'm so scared

But when I try
Try so hard
I'm falling apart
Feeling alive
When they die
He's always in my mind
But when I cry
With my heart
I'm choosing the night
Feeling alive
When you die
He's always in my mind

I sold my soul to the devil
I cannot help myself, I fall
I'm wondering if I die
If you die, if we die
Will I cry today?
I sold my soul to the devil
I cannot help myself, I fall
I'm wondering if I die
If you die, if we die
Will I cry today?
I sold my soul to the devil
