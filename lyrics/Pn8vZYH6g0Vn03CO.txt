God I wish I could hate you for the rest of my...

You can never tell me
I shouldn't walk away
It's foolish to assume that I'll be comin' back another day
And you were never right
When I was never wrong
Does truth lie in sincerity or in another sullen song?

'Cause you were right then
I should have been
The one to release it
It's coming back to tease me
But I was just bored
Your pride was too strong
But can you change it
And are you willing to face it?

You can tell your story
And coat it anyway
But you will never change who your trying to play
Now your friends are falling out
They know you just don't care
They know you never did

'Cause you were right then
I should have been
The one to release it
It's coming back to tease me
But I was just bored
Your pride was too strong
But can you change it
And are you willing to face it?

'Cause they say always the first one
Is never as good as the next
Hey, it's just rock and roll
Even though you might think you lost it all
'Cause the times they are a changin
And who can predict what's next?
Hey, you lost control
Even though you might of thought you had it all
And hey, it's just rock and roll
I'll never change, I love it just the same
I'll never change because I love it just the same

God I wish I could hate you for the rest of my life

Nothing would make me happier
