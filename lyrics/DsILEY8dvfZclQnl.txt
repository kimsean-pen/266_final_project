I've tried everything
Everything
Everything
To feel something
But nothing

I feel it in my gut
I'm gonna let you fuck me
I know I'm being used
I'm just another thing to do
I don't know why I do it to myself
Giving all my worth to someone else
I don't know why I do it to myself
I'll do it, yeah, and I'll do it 'til

I've tried everything
Everything
Everything
To feel something
But nothing

My heartaches, my heartaches, my heartaches
Why you so wicked now, heartaches
Why you so wicked now, heartaches
My heartaches, my heartaches, my heartaches
Why you so wicked now, heartaches
Why you so wicked now, heartaches

From up and down, and down to up
Sex, alcohol and drugs
It's a long way off amazing
But I can't ever see it changing
I can't tell you what I do it for
Nothing really moves me anymore
I can't tell you what I do it for
Been doing this and I'll do it till

I've tried everything
Everything
Everything
To feel something
But nothing

My heartaches, my heartaches, my heartaches
Why you so wicked now, heartaches
Why you so wicked now, heartaches
My heartaches, my heartaches, my heartaches
Why you so wicked now, heartaches
Why you so wicked now, heartaches

I'm at my worst when I'm alone
Can't take the peace
So my glass is always half empty
Someone fill it up for me
Set me free
I don't want to fall in love
No, all I need is for someone to walk all over me
Close the door behind you please
Let me be

I've tried everything
Everything
Everything
To feel something
But nothing

My heartaches, my heartaches, my heartaches
Why you so wicked now, heartaches
Why you so wicked now, heartaches
My heartaches, my heartaches, my heartaches
Why you so wicked now, heartaches
Why you so wicked now, heartaches
