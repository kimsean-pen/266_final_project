I watch the leaves fall down at midnight
there is no sound but humming streetlights
I feel the cold asleep's on my back
I've tried to sketch myself a new map

But oooh it must be lonely
If I don't want to go
inside where you won't hold me
won't you tell me to come inside
the sun will be up soon
but tonight
I'll try forgetting you

And I count the days until they're longer
but who said this haze would make me stronger

And oooh it must be lonely
if I don't want to go
inside where you won't hold me
won't you tell me to come inside
the sun will be up soon
but tonight
I'll try forgetting you
