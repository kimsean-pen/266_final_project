Despair and deception
Love's ugly little twins
Came a-knocking on my door
I let them in
Darling, you're the punishment
For all of my former sins

I let love in, I let love in

The door it opened just a crack
But love was shrewed and bold
My life flashed before my eyes
It was a horror to behold
A life-sentence sweeping confetti
From the floor of a concrete hole

I let love in, I let love in
I let love in, I let love in

Well, I've been bound and gagged
And I've been terrorized
And I've been castrated
And I've been lobotomized
But never has my tormentor come
In such a cunning disguise

I let love in, I let love in
I let love in, I let love in

Oh Lord, tell me what I done
Please don't leave me here alone
Where are my friends?
My friends are gone

Oh Lord, tell me what I done
Please don't leave me here alone
Where are my friends?
My friends are gone

I let love in, I let love in

So if you're sitting all alone
And hear a knocking at you door
And the air is full of promises
Well buddy, you've been warned
Far worse to be love's lover
Than the lover that love has scorned

I let love in, I let love in
Yeah, I let love in, I let love in
I let love in, baby I let love in
I let love in, I let love in
