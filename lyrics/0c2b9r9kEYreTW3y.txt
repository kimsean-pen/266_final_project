I've lost all my pride
I've been to paradise
And out the other side
With no one to guide me
Torn apart by a fiery wheel inside me

I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you

I'm an untouched diamond
That's golden and brilliant without illumination
You're mouth's a constellation
Stars are in your eyes
I'll take a spaceship
And try and go and find you

I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you

My pale blue star
My rainbow;
How good it is to know you're like me
Strike me with your lightening
Bring me down and bury me with ashes

I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you
I won't hurt you
[Repeat]
