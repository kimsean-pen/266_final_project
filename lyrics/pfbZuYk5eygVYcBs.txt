Oh, my goodness! What have I done?
Oh, no! I can't believe it.
It's like... I've got the whole world, in my palms
And I'm ready to (drop bombs)

Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca, Rebeca
It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca
It's my sector, homosexual dissector
Come again, rewind selector
I said nice rectum, I had a vasectomy Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lecter in the guy section I bet ya
I tantalize ya and in less than 5 seconds I get ya
They say once bitten and twice shy well I'm
Next to the guy with nine ecstasy pills and five extra
Boxes of ribbed condoms in quantities why yes sir
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser
It's my kind of vibe, what else should I try Lester?
Drop kick the bitch before her second trimester
Performed a home abortion with Dexter than I guess I'll
Dig a fetus out with a wire hanger then digest her

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in

(I said) I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball friends

All my west side bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef and blow it up
Man I think that he just fell off the deep end sho' enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwing up
Man you seen it all before you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on floor and two balls so you know who did it
You know you with it girl don't front oh no you didn't
I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls, Nicole you kidding?
I'll pee on Rihanna see man, I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room crazy gluin' Madonna
To the lazy boy sofa fold her in two and sit on her
Imagine visual for that man who would've thought I
Could ever be such a relentless prick unleashing his vengeance
But the chick so old she looks like she outlived a life sentence
I never meant this, rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in

(I said) I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right in the quicksand
Here you need a hand big man? Grab hold of this branch
With both hands but they don't understand I'm just a sick man
Now everybody's pissed at me like it's my fault
His name rhymes with so many different words geez
So one last time Mr. Christopher Reeves
Won't you brake it down for me and just spit the verse please

Eminem I'm coming to kill you
I always hated you and I still do
You'll never fill my shoes my superman costume
Doesn't even fit you
They don't feel you
You're taking this shit too far
Who do you think you are?
Hang up my suit up in the armoire
Everyday I hate you more and more
Throw down the cardboard
Let's break dance if you think you're hardcore

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
(I said) I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends
The world is mine
