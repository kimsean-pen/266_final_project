Get real with me darling
But don't waste my time
You're too busy getting messed up

You say you're in control
But you're waiting to fly
Yeah, it's no secret
I can't pretend

Don't waste my time
Don't waste my time
Don't waste my time

Don't waste my time
Don't waste my time
Don't waste my time

Another morning after
You're hanging in the air
So I'm picking up the pieces
I'm not your little black book
So I'm done spinning the web
With this realization

You're only going out tonight
You should be giving it all tonight
Oh, living on our paper trail
Loving the high life

You're only going out tonight
Cruising on autopilot
Oh, living on our paper trail
Loving the high life

Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now

Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now

Does it feel good, honey?
Now you're home in your dress
Why don't you stay here at last
Because it's all to easy to forgive and forget
But it's no secret (Can't pretend)

Don't leave, my friend

Because you're only going out tonight
You should be giving it all tonight
Oh, living on our paper trail
Loving the high life

You're only going out tonight
You're cruising on autopilot
Oh, living on our paper trail
Loving the high life

Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now

Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now

You're only going out tonight
You should be giving it all tonight
Oh, living on the paper trail
Loving the high life

You're only going out tonight
Cruising on autopilot
Oh, living on our paper trail
Loving the high life

Oh, cruising on autopilot
Oh, living on our paper trail
Loving the high life

You're loving the high life

Loving the high life
