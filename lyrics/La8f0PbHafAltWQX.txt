Waiting for another life
All I do is reminisce laying in my bed with a cigarette
Opportunities fading, crazy feelings staying only feelings
And if I go back now, how many nights till I go wild again?
(Ooo yeah)
I'm gonna live my other life
Take a chance on the other side
Maybe I'll give my other life a try tonight
I'm gonna live my other life
Take a chance on the other side

Maybe I'll give my other life a try tonight
Waiting for the other life
How could I hurt you so bad?

You're the best thing that I ever had
It's like we're getting older
And the past is growing over
I used to sleep with my best friend
That's the kind of thing that she never had
But now I'm living that other life
Got a shot from the other side
With these people that I never met places I never get
I'm gonna live my other life
Take a chance on the other side
I'm gonna give my other life a try tonight
We're still on the edge of a beautiful life
And turn away like two moths in the light
I'm still living in my dreams and I'm wet when I come down
Still ripping from the past that we held down and drown
Wake up and leave the night behind
Cause now I'm living that other life
Only hope I can get it right
I need someone who don't look at thing like what I left behind
I'm gonna live my other life
Take a chance on the other side
Maybe I'll give my other life a try tonight
See what it's like on the other side
