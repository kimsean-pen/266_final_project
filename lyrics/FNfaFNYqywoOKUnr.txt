I'll take you for a ride
On my garbage truck
Oh no
I'll take you to the dump

'Cause you're my queen
Take you uptown
I'll show you the sites

You know you wanna ride
On my garbage truck
Truck, truck, truck

We'll pass the mansions by
Drive right through the needle's eye
Oh my
My my my my

I got a stereo
You just gotta turn the knob
Well, maybe we'll go
As far as we can

I'll be your garbage man
I'll take out your junk
And I'll crush it down

Jesus in the rear view
And the highway patrol is up ahead
In my garbage truck, truck

I'll never throw you away
When you're old and gray
We'll just roll it away
