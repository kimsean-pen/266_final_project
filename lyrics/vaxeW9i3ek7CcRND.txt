Faith, you are
Holy ghost
You know
Know my blood

Do I know you?
What keeps us free
If you believe, please allow
Me to say hello to you

Yes, I understand
Yes, I know my way/will
Yes, I am a man
Yes, I, yes, I

Lover, lover, catch me slow
You can't sell me, know this
You can't have my side
Lover, lover, stay with me alive

Yod he vau
Brothers, sisters, roll
Salam, ride on

Yod he vau
Let's ride on
Let's ride on
Let's ride on

Yes, I understand
Yes, I know my way
Yes, I am one man
Yes, I

Yes, I understand
Yes, I know my way
Yes, I am one man
