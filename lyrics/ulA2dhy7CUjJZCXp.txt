I summoned up the living dead and demons in the skies
I drank from chalice warm and red and watched the virgin die
Present at ungodly births in holy paradise
I spread eternal dark on earth and raped mother of Christ
Oh, mother of Christ

C'mon baby raise your knife
Welcome darling to my sacrifice
Oh, sacrifice

Tie the angel to the altar, sacrifice to Lord of hell
Let the warm blood torrent, baby
While the moonlight sets the night on spell
I saw the lightning strike in the skies and heard you roar of pain
Oh, lift the knife and strike once more
Your blood is mixed with the rain

C'mon baby raise your knife
Welcome darling to my sacrifice
Oh, sacrifice

I summoned up the living dead and demons in the skies
I drank from chalice warm and red and watched the virgin die
Present at ungodly births in holy paradise
I spread eternal dark on earth and raped mother of Christ
Oh, mother of Christ

C'mon baby raise your knife
Welcome darling to my sacrifice
Oh, sacrifice
