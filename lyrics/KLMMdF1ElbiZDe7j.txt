Throw my head to the sky
Cover the sun in my eyes
I can see your silhouette, silhouette
I'll find a way to get to you
You look at me and I blush
You're like a perfect mirage
And they say you're out of my league
Out of reach
I don't mind

I'll break my back for just one touch
All my blood for your love
Not in it for the honour
For you I swear I'm gonna
Run through a thousand burning fields
And nothing can stop me
Not in it for the glory
I just hope you're waiting for me

Never gonna give up
I won't let nobody harm ya
I'mma fight for your love
Like a gladiator
Give it all that I've got
I'm your knight in shining armour
I'mma fight for your love
Like a gladiator
Like a gladiator

You built your walls real high
Nobody else dares to climb
But I'm a work my fingers to the bone
All the way to your throne

Catch every arrow in my shield
If it brings you to me
Not in it for the honour
For you I swear I'm gonna
Run through a thousand burning fields
And nothing can stop me
Not in it for the glory
I just hope you're waiting for me

Never gonna give up
I won't let nobody harm ya
I'mma fight for your love
Like a gladiator
Give it all that I've got
I'm your knight in shining armour
I'mma fight for your love
Like a gladiator
Like a gladiator

I'm gonna wait for your love
I'm gonna fight for your love
Don't care 'bout the odds I'll take on the world if I must
They will be screaming my name
You're gonna see who I am
I'll show you what I'm made of
There's nothing I'm afraid of

Never gonna give up
I won't let nobody harm ya
I'mma fight for your love
Like a gladiator
Give it all that I've got
I'm your knight in shining armour
I'mma fight for your love
Like a gladiator

Never gonna give up
I won't let nobody harm ya
I'mma fight for your love
Like a gladiator
Give it all that I've got
I'm your knight in shining armour
I'mma fight for your love
Like a gladiator
Like a gladiator
