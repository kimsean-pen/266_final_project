Time's been ticking, hearts are runnin'
Think that Cupid's up to somethin'
You asked me how I feel
I say nothin'

But lately colors seems so bright
And the stars light up the night
My feet they feel so light
I'm ignoring all the signs

I keep on frontin'
Yeah, I stay bluffin'
I keep you wonderin'
Keep you huntin' for my lovin'

But I crave us huggin'
Yeah, I stay stubborn
'Cause I can't admit that you got all the strings
And know just how to tug 'em

I think I'm in love again
(In my head, yeah, you're in my head)
I think I'm in love again
(In my head, yeah, you're in my head)
I didn't think it could be true
Let alone that it would be you
I think I'm in love again
(I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)

My heart's pacin', I'm confused,
I'm dazin'
I saw something I never seen in you
It's got me shakin'

I must be hallucinatin'
I hear it happens
I'm just sayin'
Babe, I'm just sayin'

Someone give me some paper
Someone give me some crayons
I'm feeling like a child
I need something to play on

I'm trying hard to trust you
When you say, "Give me your hand"
Baby, I'm fallin'
I hope you catch me when I land

I think I'm in love again
(In my head, yeah, you're in my head)
I think I'm in love again
(In my head, yeah, you're in my head)
I didn't think it could be true
Let alone that it would be you
I think I'm in love again
(I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)

In my dreams you're the dutch and I'm the duchess
And your blunts are always loose
So I'm in charge of rollin' dutches
And we getting so high
We always get the munchies
And we go for early brunches
That turn into late lunches

And we ain't gotta label
We're just rollin' with the punches
I make fun of your belly
And tell you to do some crunches
And you say, "Yeah, well, your ass jiggles
Go and do some lunges"
I say, "Fuck you," while I'm thinking of you as my husband

I think I'm in love

I think I'm in love again
Baby, I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again
(In my head, yeah, you're in my head)
I didn't think it could be true
Let alone that it would be you
I think I'm in love again
(I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)
I think I'm in love again
