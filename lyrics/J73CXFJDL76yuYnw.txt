It's easy to fall in love
But it's so hard to break somebody's heart
What seemed like a good idea
Has turned into a battlefield

Once lust has turned to dust
And all that's left's held breaths
forgotten who we first met
What seemed like a good idea
Has turned into a battlefield

We both know it's coming in dozen
Illusion count for something we hide
Surface tensions got a break
One drop is all it takes to flood out this lie

Ohhhh

You and I, we have to let each other go
We keep holding on but we both know
What seemed like a good idea
Has turned into a battlefield

Peace will come when one of us puts down the gun
Be strong for both of us, no please don't run, don't run
Eye to eye we face our fears
Unarmed on the battlefield

We seemed like a good idea
We seemed like a good idea

No blood will spill, we won't get out now
Still, it's hard to put the fire out
What seemed like a good idea
Has turned into a battlefield

Feelings are shifting like the tide
And I think to much about the future
What seemed like a good idea
Has turned into a battlefield

We both know it's coming
Does illusion count for something we hide
Surface tensions got a break
One drop is all it takes to flood out this lie

Ohhhh

You and I, we have to let each other go
We keep holding on but we both know
What seemed like a good idea
Has turned into a battlefield
Peace will come when one of us puts down the gun
Be strong for both of us no please don't run, don't run
Eye to eye we face our fears
Unarmed on the battlefield
We seemed like a good idea
We seemed like a good idea
We seemed like a good idea
We seemed like a good idea
