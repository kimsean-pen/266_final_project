Winter, eternal night
Be my solace, be my light
Naked trees like they always been dead
Eternal curse
Dreams have told me, dreams have shown
The beauty of this place
Death and darkness, funeral mist
Desolation
Realm of plagues
Shadow, no source of life
Frozen in flames ice
O Ruler of shadows come forth
End my seeking
Hear the silence scream if anguish
See the darkness shine
Dominion of the devil himself
Kingdome divine
God!
I entreat thee, oh mightiest of adnegmeolnss
End my seeking of the realm of plagues
