Sitting in the far horizon
The evergreens across the border
Can you see a different story
With the failure and the glory

The truth is in the eyes of the beholder
The truth is in her eyes when you hold her

Everywhere you turn there's people
They got their ways that can be lethal
You wonder how could this be true
When you see the things they do

The truth is in the eyes of the beholder
The truth is in her eyes when you hold her

The truth is in the eyes of the beholder

Show your papers to the officer
You're an alien foreigner
They ask for this and they give you that
Now you leave, you're turning back

The truth is in the eyes of the beholder
Now you leave, you're turning back
The truth is in the eyes of the beholder
Now you leave, you're turning back
