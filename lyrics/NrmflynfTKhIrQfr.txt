All I have is all I need
Enough for love but not for greed, yeah
I was younger once, this guy came to me
Told me about all, the honey out there
He said, honey, gold jewels, money, women
Wine, cars that shine
I don't know what he was talking about
But I think, I had an idea
He said, smell the rose, sweet, sweet rose
Catch the sun, find where it grows
Smell the rose, the sweet, sweet rose
That grows on castle walls in heaven
In heaven, yeah
Well, if it feels like summer
You're catching the sun
And I'm catching the moment you fall
If it tastes like honey
Don't swallow it all
Don't wait for the moment to come
And catch the sun
Hey dude, don't lean on me, man
'Cause I'm losing my direction
And I can't understand
No, no
Hey dude, well I do what I can
But you treat me like a woman
When I feel like a man
I was crossing the city one day
Everybody was flashing by me
Like images of tombstones
Images of tombstones
On a Friday night
I've seen everybody looking for their little bit of honey
To alleviate the pain
To alleviate the pain
Well, if it feels like summer, don't burn in the sun
Don't wait for the evening fall
If it tastes like honey, don't swallow it all
Don't wait for the moment to come and catch the sun
Hey dude, don't lean on me, man
'Cause I'm losing my direction
And I can't understand
No, no
Hey dude, well I do what I can
But you treat me like a woman
When I feel like a man
And I can't understand
No, no, n-no, no, n-no
I can't understand
When I feel like a man
If it tastes like honey
Catch the sun
Hey dude, don't lean on me, man
'Cause I'm losing my direction
And I can't understand
No, no
Hey dude, well I do what I can
But you treat me like a woman
When I feel like a man
Hey, dude
No, no, n-no, no, n-no
Hey, dude
No, no, n-no, no, n-no
Hey dude, well I do what I can
But you treat me like a woman
When I feel like a man
