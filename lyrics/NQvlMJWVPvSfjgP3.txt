I wake up lonely without love at my side
I wake up lonely and I don't know why
I make the money now it's way back home
It seems it never really works for long

But here
In my heart
An endless hole
No words to deny

You ring I'm running home
All this love
Nowhere to go
The dark around your lies

You ring I'm running home
You ring I'm running
You ring I'm running home
You ring I'm running

And I'm the one
The only one
Or someone

I took the life and soul from every dream
Until it sucked the life and soul from me

But here
Where I go
Sometimes so low

When night whips the tide
You ring I'm running home
All this time
It moves so slow
Your kiss never dies

You ring I'm running home
You ring I'm running
You ring I'm running home
You ring I'm running

And I'm the one
The only one
Or someone

Now I'm not trying to hide it
The skies all deny it
Raise a hand and fight but
It's part of me

My hammer out beside it puncturing the quiet
Love unwind
This is all I need
Now I'm not trying to hide it
The skies all deny it
Raise a hand and fight but
It's part of me
My hammer out beside it puncturing the quiet
Love unwind
This is all I need
Now I'm not trying to hide it
The skies all deny it
Raise a hand and fight but
It's part of me
My hammer out beside it puncturing the quiet
Love unwind
This is all I need
Now I'm not trying to hide it
The skies all deny it
Raise a hand and fight but
It's part of me
My hammer out beside it puncturing the quiet
Love unwind
This is all I need
