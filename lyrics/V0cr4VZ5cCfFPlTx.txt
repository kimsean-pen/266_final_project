Two a.m
Silhouettes
Splayed on the bedsheets
Crime of the century
Forever unkempt
All the muscle memory
It must take to stay close to me

I'm a cloud when you come onto me
Tell me again
What's the allure of inconsequential love?

I'm a fool for your pageantry
Tell me again
What's the allure of inconsequential love?

Oh, the muscle memory
Continue to haunt me
Oh, the muscle memory
Continue to haunt me
Oh, the muscle memory
Continue to haunt me

I promise as soon as the war ends
I'll find you and we'll break laws again
As civilians
