I hope you find your piece.
Your piece of mind has always brought me peace
And I could really use your time.

So write love on your arms, or carve it into your palms.
I see the world has broke you and you don't deserve more harm.

You are the cause and cure to your own pain,
You are the eye and the hurricane.
I see the pain in your face,
You will find a home, you will find a place.

Entertaining death is such a fruitless endeavour.
You want to die today, you don't wanna die forever.

Hold close, the ones you love.
Sovereignty is never enough.

You are the cause and cure to your own pain,
You are the eye and the hurricane.
I see the pain in your face,
You will find a home, you will find a place.

The answers are etched into your own palms,
You are the storm and you are the calm.
I see the shell in your place,
You will find a home, you will find a place.

It's ink in your skin, it's time passing by.
It's permanent just like a dead man's goodbye
