Some people think they jive me
But I know they must be crazy
They don't see dey misfortune
Or else they just a little too lazy

I Walk thru the fire
An I Fly thru the smoke
I wanna see my enemies
At the end of my rope

I Walk on pins and needles
An I See what they can do
I Walk on gilded splinters
With the king of the Zulu

Singing
Come to me giddi come come
Walk on gilded splinters
Come to me giddi come come
Walk on gilded splinters

Till I burn up, Till I burn Up, Till I burn up.

I'm walking out of my coffin
Drink poison in my chalice
Pride begins to fade
And y'all will feel my malice

Put gris gris on your doorstep
Soon you'll be in the gutter
looking just like butter
A-a-and I can make you stutter

I Walk thru the fire
An I Fly thru the smoke
I wanna see my enemies
At the end of my rope

I Walk on pins and needles
An I See what they can do
I Walk on gilded splinters
With the king of the Zulu

Singing
Come to me giddi come come
Walk on gilded splinters
Come to me giddi come come
Walk on gilded splinters

Till I burn up, Till I burn Up, Till I burn up.
