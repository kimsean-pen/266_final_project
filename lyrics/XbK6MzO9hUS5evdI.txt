You say you love me
And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you in the candlelight
There's no one, but myself to blame
But there's something inside that's turning my mind away
Oh, how I could love you
If I could let you stay

(It's late) When I'm bleeding deep inside
(It's late) Ooh, is it just my sickly pride?
(Too late) Even now the feeling seems to steal away
(So late) Though I'm crying, I can't help but hear you say
It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late

The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time, the more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down
Now you tell me you're leaving and I just can't believe it's true
Oh, you know that I can love you
Though I know I can't be true
Oh, you made me love you
Don't tell me that we're through

(It's late) But it's driving me so mad
(It's late) Yes, I know, but don't try to tell me that it's
(Too late) Save our love, you can't turn out the lights
(So late) I've been wrong, but I'll learn to be right
It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late

I've been so long, you've been so long
We've been so long trying to work it out
I ain't got long, you ain't got long
We gotta know what this life is all about

Tell me
Try to work it out, yeah
Ooh
Ooh, too late
Yeah, too late, much too late, ah

You're staring at me with suspicion in your eye
You say what game are you playing?
What's this that you're saying?
I know that I can't reply
If I take you tonight, is it making my life a lie?
Oh, you make me wonder
Did I live my life right?

(It's late) Ooh, but it's time to set me free
(It's late) Ooh, yes, I know, but there's no way it has to be
(Too late) So let the fire take our bodies this night
(So late) Let the waters take our guilt in the tide, now
It's late, it's late, it's late, it's late
It's late, it's late, it's late

Oh, it's all too late
Whoa, oh, it's too late
Come on
I'm late, ooh, late, oh, yeah
Whoa
