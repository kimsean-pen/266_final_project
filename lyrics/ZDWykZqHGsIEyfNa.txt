I hear overtones
That make this another song
Out of reach of human hands
We don't have control

I use major chords
To make this a sadder song
An effective manipulation
Moonlight reflected is many times stronger

I wrote this song for me
But now I let it go
From the island of the Texaco
I release it into the custody
Of my Huckleberry friend

Am i making pitch or honey?
I've no idea why I feel strong
Am i making pitch or honey?

"it's the gift that keeps on getting
That's the shrapnel from your wedding," she said

"it's the gift that keeps on getting
That's the shrapnel from your wedding," she said

Hey, I love you better when you're wild
It suit's you better if I say so
I hear overtones that make this another song
Out of reach of human hands
We don't have control

When I am dark and I am down
As dark and down as I am now
The only thing that makes me smile
Is to remember

Hey, I love you better when you're wild
It suit's you better if I say so
Hey, I love you better when you're wild
It suit's you better if I say so
Hey, I love you better when you're wild
It suit's you better if I say so
Hey, I love you better when you're wild
It suit's you better if I say so

When I am dark and I am down
As dark and down as I am now
The only thing that makes me smile
Is to remember
That i'm beloved of the wild

And may you ever return
To the warmth of your species
