I fell in love with a bad bad man
And ever since I met him I've been sad sad sad
I'm a jailbird to your music
A criminal in your prayer
I watch you when you sleep
Even when you're not there
Rainbows wept color all over the street
When you went away, maybe one day we'll meet
Lipstick I'd wear for one million years
Just to stop your eyes from falling them tears

I fell in love with a bad bad man
And every since I met him I've been sad sad sad
I'm a jailbird to your music
I'm a criminal in your prayer
I watch you in your sleep
Even when you're not there
Rainbows wept color all over the street
When you went away, maybe one day we'll meet
One day we'll meet
One day we'll meet

One day
Yes, maybe we
Will meet
