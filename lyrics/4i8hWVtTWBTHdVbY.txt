I was all full of pain just again, I had
There was no one that could get me out of it
Yes, I think the drinking was a bit excessive
Just to be frank, the drinking ain't what caused me to be aggressive

My heart has been taken over
Every day I get colder to 'em
I realize need to let go
Expression from the get go to 'em, yeah

Feelin' the like I just need to speak my brain
(Yes I know it bites to like)
I'm going to cause you pain
(The more you've got to)
Realize I've got to get (always crazy)
Got to lose my cool

I was so full of pain just again, I had
There was no way for me to get over it
So I kept it bottled all up inside of me
'Til I felt the pressure, I could no longer breathe

Yeah you know I
Feelin' the like I just need to speak my brain
(Yes I know it bites to like)
I'm going to cause you pain
(The more you've got to)
Realize I've got to get (always crazy)
Got to lose my cool
Got to lose my cool, yeah

Feelin' the like I just need to speak my brain (got to speak my brain now, baby)
(Yes I know it bites to like)
I'm going to cause you pain (maybe cause you pain now, baby)
(The more you've got to)
Realize I've got to get (always crazy)
Got to lose my cool
Got to lose my cool

Got to lose my cool now, baby
Got to lose my cool now, darling
And I may act a fool now, baby
