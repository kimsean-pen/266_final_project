Maybe I'm alone?
But I know this

I'm never coming back here
There's only one way
Future Politics
I'm never coming back here
There's only one way
Future Politics

Future Politics

I look ahead and I think about it
There's still a hope somebody needs to feel

I don't wanna hear that it's all my fault
The system won't help you and your money won't help

We're out of this [?]
The grave has been dug
I'm looking for something to rise up above

I'm never coming back here
There's only one way
Future Politics
I'm never coming back here
There's only one way
Future Politics

Future Politics

Rest assure and I'll find it, I'll take it
Rest assure, when I find it
I will take it

I'm not a coward, like them
Well, I got my money
I'm not a coward, like them
I don't need more money

I'm never coming back here
There's only one way
Future Politics
I'm never coming back here
There's only one way
Future Politics

Future Politics

I'm never coming back here
There's only one way
Future Politics
I'm never coming back here
There's only one way
Future Politics
