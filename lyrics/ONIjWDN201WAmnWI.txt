Aight, cool

Feeling good feeling better
Feeling bad feeling fed up
Ether way we go stack cheddar
Man this song to you is my letter
My letter to the fan
Middle finger to to the hater
Don't really give a fuck
Bish I'm a go getter
난 래퍼이기 전에 예술가야 임마
fuck your 개솔

You're runnig out of time
Let me teach you right now
네 눈은 어디 가있나
난 바다 건너야 임마
내 노래는 꼬리에 꼬리를 물고
Making trouble like I said it before
One more 네 여자친구와
친구들의 아이폰 속
경리단 또 신사 앞
길거리 어느 곳도
내 얘기를 빼면 다 정적 no
I told ya I told ya I'm glowed up

Bright & yellow
Bellow fellow
When I rap fuck yo rap
I spit it acapella
내가 했던 말이
현실로 하나씩 되어가도
절대 만족 하지 않어
그래서 계속 나는 애써 uh
포기란 단어는 됐어 uh
어떤 모습이 됐던 uh yeah
Coming to you live
When I pain this picture

황인 yellow
그게 나의 피부톤
누가 뭐라던
I don't really give a fuck
Don't give a fuck
아무도 못 가봤던
곳을 찾아가
Is it right or wrong
Don't wanna know
Yeah bish
Don't give a fuck
마음 가는 대로 가 그게 어디던
지금 가는 곳은 너한테 fan이면
Coming to you live
Like woah
