I picked up the pen and drew a blank
An image in my head and a heart that sank
With years in perspective to put them all on the line
Thoughts of moving forward with the fear of falling
Behind that wall that I've built so tall
But now I'm at the top
Searching for a pulse in this lifeless city is less a quest, it's wishful thinking
If you measured mine on an EKG
I'd resemble the skyline out by 7th street

I'm not as clever as my words but I'm as sly as a thief
I'm as open as a casket with my fears and my beliefs
It's the sick leading the blind I bury truth and blame my pride
Now the blind as become sick with their eyes now open wide
I watched my skin walk out the door
I did not say goodbye
