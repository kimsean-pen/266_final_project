Spreading your love from the tip of a sword
Echoing an elitism that poisons you
Thinking you know what's good for us all
I wish I could reach out, and

Silence you..., but
I'm a waste in your eyes
You say you don't need me to
Save you tonight
But I need to
Save you tonight

I'm Standing alone on the brink of a storm trying to
Humanize the enemy inside of you, we're
Cut from the same cloth but we are
Stained with the poison of pride
We're sucking the life from the whole of the world
We can't be confined or condemned to be
Reduced to a place to survive and resolve
In the end they'll try, and

Silence you
Cause we're a
Waste in their eyes
The grace they describe
Won't save you tonight

Spreading your love from the tip of a sword
Echoing an elitism that poisons you
We won't ever feel alone anymore or let pride
Come before a fall
I wish you could see me for something more than the
Things I'm confined and condemned to be
They will know our names and we
Won't be ignored, so that we
May see some light...
Don't let them

Silence you
Cause you're a
Waste in their eyes
There's a grace inside of you
I need tonight
