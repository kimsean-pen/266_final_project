enter umbra:
smoke and mirrors
lungs fill up while I look in
get your licks up on the surface,
theres no sugar down and under

circuitry so complex it only works itself
I caged my head in the clouds
and my feet underground

everytime I close my eyes I crash a
thousand cars and all my loved ones die
surging with the urges to mutilate and all
the guilt of every unwanted thought it brings
how did it get like this?
psychosomatic ticks keeping the feeble
conscious stuck inside a broken stereo
no control on the dial of deathfmradio

all I've seen now I see despised
don't you get it?
I didn't expect a thing

everytime I close my eyes I crash a
thousand cars and all my loved ones die
surging with the urges to mutilate and all
the guilt of every unwanted thought it brings
how did it get like this?

you sing to wage war
you sing to build this cage
violent opera, sing me to death

how'd it get like this?
