Something you can't hide says you're lonely
Hidden deep inside of you only
It's there for you to see, take a look and be
Burn slowly, the candle of life

Something there outside says we're only
In the hands of time, falling slowly
It's there for us to know with love that we can go
Burn slowly, the candle of life

So love everybody and make them your friends
So love everybody and make them your friends

Something you can't hide says you're lonely
Hidden deep inside of you only
It's there for you to see, take a look and be
Burn slowly, the candle of life

Something there outside says we're only
In the hands of time, falling slowly
It's there for us to know with love that we can go
Burn slowly, the candle of life
