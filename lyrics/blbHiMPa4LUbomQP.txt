I've been trying to reach you
'Cause I've got something to say
But you're talking about
Just nothing at all
And you're slipping away

We were cryin' together
It was a long time ago
Before you walk out that door
And leave me this way
Just hear what I say

You make me feel
You make me real
For the rest of my days
In so many ways
You make me feel

I've been trying to leave you
Why should we go on like this?
But my heart can't breathe
When I hear you say
"It's better this way"

You make me feel
You make me real
For the rest of my days
In so many ways
You make me feel

Ten thousand light years away from you
Keep thinking maybe it's time to let go
But by the end of the day
I still want to say, "Do you?"

You make me feel
You make me real
For the rest of my days
In so many ways
You make me feel
I've been trying to reach you
'Cause I've got something to say
For the rest of my days
In so many ways
You make me feel
