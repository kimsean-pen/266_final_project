Lay me on the road. Next to the other dead carcasses.
Watch the murder, swarm above. Rip me limb to limb.
Took everything and left me. Only eyes to see what they've done.
You don't know what it feels like to have it all rest on something important.
Pressures pushing in from both sides. I'll break soon.
I would try to scream, but I don't have a voice anymore.
Been at it for weeks, there's no end. Feeling stretched across the table,
I'm next to nothing. All the eyes on me, watch me fail.
Always left broke, no where is home. I see the edge but I pretend that I don't.
Go on ahead, make sure to say hello cause I won't be there.
