Hello, hello, I know it's been awhile but, baby
I got something that I really wanna let you know, yeah
Something that I wanna let you know, oh, oh, oh

You say you say that everybody that you hate me
Couldn't blame you, 'cause I know I left you all alone, yeah
I know that I left you all alone

And, yeah, now I'm back at your door
You're lookin' at me, I'm sure
I should've seen it before
You're all I think about, baby

I was so stupid for letting you go
But I-I-I know you're still the one
You might have moved on
But, girl, you should know
That I-I-I know you're still the one

I know it's sayin' too much
But I will never give up
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know you're still the one
I know you're still the one

Hello, hello, I'm really hoping you'll forgive me
I keep talking, begging, tell me what I wanna hear, yeah
Girl, just tell me what I wanna hear

I tried, I tried to start again and find somebody
But I remember all the times and all the words he said, yeah
I can't get it out of my head, yeah

Now I'm back at your door
You lookin' at me unsure
I should've seen it before
You're all I think about, baby

I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know you're still the one
You might have moved on
But, girl, you should know
That I know you're still the one

I know it's sayin' too much
But I will never give up
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know you're still the one
Hey, you, you're still the one
Hey, you, you're still the one
Hey, you, you're still the one
Hey, you, you're still the one
I know it's sayin' too much
But I will never give up
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know you're still the one
I know you're still the one
