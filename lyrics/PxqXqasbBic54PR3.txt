A spirale movement, the ultimate mystery
Will you show... will you show who you are?

Its the truth that untrue suspicion is
Spreading like a disease
Do you know if it is real?

Voices appear inside my brain
Their need, to set me free
Onward they lead before the dawn
Teach me whats right and wrong

Encourage the madness they welcome impurity
I dont kow... I dont kow... who I am!
Fallen blind to the cruel hysteria thats
Constantly challenging
Me, all alone... all alone... cant be real

Voices approve I cant relate
Their need to celebrate
Onward they lead before the dawn
Teach me whats right and wrong
Voices approve, the quest begins
Fuel for the shadowkings
Onwards they lead before the dawn
Teach me whats right from wrong
