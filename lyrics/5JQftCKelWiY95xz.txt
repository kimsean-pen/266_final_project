I'm gonna watch you
while you get me wrong
I'm gonna sing
until you hate this song

I'm gonna tell you
in my sweetest voice
I'm gonna choose you
'cause you have no choice

This funny thing we got
Is never gonna stop. Oh no!

I'm gonna take you
to the wilderness
I'm gonna show you
things you might have missed
I'm gonna kiss the parts
that you have lost
It's gonna cost you
but you might hurt less

This funny thing we got
Is never gonna stop
until we drip drop tear drop

I'm gonna work
til we get it on
I'm gonna love you
till we get alone
and when your ears and your eyes are sored
I'm gonna love you just a little bit more

It's funny thing we got
It's never gonna stop
until we drip drop tear drop
