The sky is raining fire
We dance between the bombs
The curtain falls tonight
Over the ruins and tombs
We dance to celebrate
Our history and fate
We're shining to exist
Injustice and hatred can't makes us fall in the night

Dance with me dance
And burning bright the flow inside you
Dance with me dance
You'll recognize the light inside you

Trust me, you will be starry-eyed
If you are not afraid to dry out your sorrow
A thunderstorm has just begun
I cannot wait to see you win this bloody war under my eyes
And feel alive

Dance with me dance
And burning bright the flow inside you (Burning deep in my soul)
Dance with me dance
You'll recognize the light inside you

And feel alive

Dance with me dance
And burning bright the flow inside you (Burning deep in my soul)
Dance with me dance
You'll recognize the light inside you

Dance with me dance
Dance with me dance
