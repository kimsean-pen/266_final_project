This town has only had this one old lonely homeless man
For as long as I can think back
He was a Vietnam Vet
He got beaten to death in Memorial Park under one of the benches
The cops all said it was probably kids
But nobody ever found them
I guess they stopped trying
And I wonder if they ever did

It's a sober sight
The old alcoholics that drink by the train
Riding Good Will bikes and constantly running away
Wearing starter jackets for teams that haven't existed since the nineties
With discouraged faces they're counting down days
And pulling at paper bag forties
Man, I'm sorry
