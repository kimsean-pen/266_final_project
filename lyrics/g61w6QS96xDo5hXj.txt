I walk to the echo of stars
All around me, under me
A bed made of curious cloth
A pillow from a crib
The skies are dark, all of them
Still comforting starlight
Pouring all over this new home
High above

Younger than yesterday
I feel no pain, no memory lost
Alone yet with everything
What is this space?

Goodnight to an old soul
Goodbye to life once lived
This is my island now
To live it once more
Not long now
This time, this weightless fall
The calming mothers call
Back in time; I'm cleansed and bare
And I see the light
Now I know

They left me with a softest bed
A whitest cloth for a waiting dead
A light to pride and the frequent night
An apple for a thirsty bite
A clean slate, a newborn mind
Brightest blue, purple moon
Life once lived now understood
High above

Tonight I will make the leap
Deep down to the night unknown
That's why they put me here
They, they...

Goodnight to an old soul
Goodbye to life once lived
This is my island now
To live it once more
Not long now

This time, this weightless fall
The calming mothers call
Back in time; I'm cleansed and bare
And I see the light
Now I know
Goodnight to an old soul
Goodbye to life once lived
This is my island now
And live it once more
Not long now
This time, this weightless fall
The calming mothers call
Back in time; I'm cleansed and bare
And I see the light
Now I know
