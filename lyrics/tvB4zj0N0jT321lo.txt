Let me be your stranger
Let me walk through your garden door
Let me play in the leaves
Under your sacred trees
Take that part of me

Now pull your body open
Tear me apart slowly limb by limb
Pull the skin to your eyes
And watch it come alive
Till it screams and dies

A naked body folded
Her passion by design
Eden's heart ripped open
His lovers eyes don't know but say why

Let me down in your flower
Cover my mouth with roses and thorns
Let me bleed over you and make my wish come true
While the world turns blue

She wants to take him over
Oh how he dies for her
But the garden's turned to ashes
He's such a whore for her but she wants more

Let me be your stranger
