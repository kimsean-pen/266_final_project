Tell me why I've given up on everything,
And everyone just lets me down
Draw your conclusions take what you want from me

I'm already dead

Dead, already dead

Nothing makes me feel the way I once did
I still miss those days when I was living
Ignorance is bliss and I can't get it back
I'm the only one with nothing to lose

Nothing to lose

The pain it speads the waters surrounding me
I sink and I smile cause I know that I'll never be found
I'm watching the water rise
Abandon this sinking ship
Just leave me alone to die
It pulls me down deeper and deeper

I'm the one with nothing to lose
I'm already dead

ABANDON THIS SINKING SHIP I'M ALREADY DEAD

ABANDON THIS SINKING SHIP I'M ALREADY DEAD

With nothing to lose.
