Please don't touch me
I've come to far to let you bring me down
He's thinks that I'm easy
But try as you might you can't have me now

These tedious dances
We run through but I've memorized them now
I quietly melt down
Ad consent to you if only just to ball

As I stare through you and I stand quite still
And an alarm sounds just up the road
I can tell you'd like some company
But I can't fix you and you don't want me

I call for the witness
Present the facts right down to the little things
They say the heart is resilient
In black and white you swore there'd be no strings

I sneak out the back door
But the gavel strikes, and I can hear you cry
And the sound of my footsteps
This time there will be no long goodbye

As I stare through you and I stand quite still
And an alarm sounds just up the road
I can tell you'd like some sympathy
But I can't fix you and you don't want me

How can I trust you?
How could you need me now?
Its getting to be so cold

The decision is in and I won't break
You cut and you run with our lives at stake
Well, someone might get hurt and it won't be me

The decision is in there will be no fight
It might sound cold but I know its right
Cause someone must get hurt and it won't be me
