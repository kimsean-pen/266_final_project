Carrie and Lowell

Carrie and Lowell
Summertime long ago
Like a dead horse
Meadowlark drive your arrow

Carry me home
Rosie has turned to sorrow
Head on the floorboards
Drunk as a horsefly
Climb on my mattress pad
Twist my arm

Under the pear tree
Shadows and light conspiring
Covered bridge, I scream
Cottage Grove shade invite me

I will bow down
Lord of the ancient waters
In the backyard
Carrie surprised me
Erebus on her back
Like a charm
