It's late too late to keep this level up much longer,
we've got to turn it off or turn it down.
So why do we do this?
Why do we do these things we don't wanna do at all?
And why do we do this? Beating our heads up against the wall.

I keep on driving like a crazy man without the headlights,
racing somewhere I know I shouldn't go.
So why do we do this?
Why do we aim for spots we know that hurt the most?
And why do we do this, why do we do this?

It must be the angels on a rampage,
they're taking matters into their own hands.
They're making us do what we don't want,
making me say I'm moving on.
Must be the angels on a rampage.

What kind of poison did you slip me when I wasn't looking?
What kind of hold do I have on you?
And why do we do this?
Why do we do these things we don't wanna do at all?
And why do we do this?

It must be the angels on a rampage,
they're taking matters into their own hands.
They're making us do what we don't want,
making me say I'm moving on.
Must be the angels on a rampage.

Must be the angels on a rampage.

It must be the angels on a rampage,
they're taking matters into their own hands.
They're making us do what we don't want,
making me say I'm moving on.
Must be the angels on a rampage
