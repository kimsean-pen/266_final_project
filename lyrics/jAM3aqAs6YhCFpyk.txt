No one ever said that love was gonna be easy
Gotta take the ups and downs, the in-betweens
If you take this journey, gotta give yourself completely
Never let nobody ever step on our dreams

You better stop
Listen to these words that I say
You better stop
Don't you throw this good thing away
Put your trust in me
And I'll make you see

No the rain won't last forever
Find a way to make it better
Long as we can stand together
Love will find a way
Gonna make a new tomorrow
Say goodbye to tears and sorrow
Better listen when I say
Love will find a way

Somebody tried to tell me love don't last forever
Said it only happens in your wildest dreams
After all is said and done we're still here together
Never listen to the lies and jealousy

You better stop
Don't you let them turn you around
You better stop
Hang onto this love that we've found
Nothing ever say
Can stand in our way

No the rain won't last forever
Find a way to make it better
Long as we can stand together
Love will find a way
Gonna make a new tomorrow
Say goodbye to tears and sorrow
Better listen when I say
Love will find a way

I want you, I need you
You know that I believe you.
We got it, you know it
So if it's real just show it

I want you, I need you
You know that I believe you
We got it, you know it
So if it's real just show it

You better stop
Listen to these words that I say
You better stop
Don't you throw this good thing away, no
Put your trust in me and I'll make you see

No the rain won't last forever
Find a way to make it better
Long as we can stand together
love will find a way
Gonna make a new tomorrow
Say goodbye to tears and sorrow
Better listen when I say
Love will find a way.

No the rain won't last forever
Find a way to make it better
Long as we can stand together
Love will find a way
Gonna make a new tomorrow
Say goodbye to tears and sorrow
Better listen when I say
Love will find a way
I want you, I need you
You know that I believe you
We got it, you know it
So if it's real just show it
I want you, I need you
You know that I believe you
We got it, you know it
So if it's real just show it
