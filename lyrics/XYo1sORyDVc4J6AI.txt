I know the light is growing faint now
I know that hope can wear away now
But I always keep your heart
Safe when it gets dark

Sleep now, send your worries to the moon
Sleep now, a million lights watch over you
Oh tomorrow the dawn will break
Through your window and when you wake
I'll still be here

(La la la, la la la)
(La la la)
(La la la, la la la)
(La la la)

Well kingdoms rise and kingdoms fall now
Tonight you're scared the sky is gonna tumble on us
But I always keep you warm
When we're waiting out a storm

Sleep now, send your worries to the moon
Sleep now, a million lights watch over you
Oh tomorrow the dawn will break
Through your window and when you wake
I'll still be here

(La la la, la la la)
(La la la)
(La la la, la la la)
(La la la)

But I always keep you warm
When we're waiting out a storm

Sleep now, send your worries to the moon
Sleep now, a million lights watch over you
Oh tomorrow the dawn will break
Through your window and when you wake
I'll still be here

(La la la, la la la)
(La la la)
(La la la, la la la)
(La la la)
