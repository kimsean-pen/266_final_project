Your unpleasant family
smashed up my car
(perfectly uncalled for)

Your unpleasant family,
how vile they are
(I crawl out of the wreckage on my knees)

It's alright my flower,
so what do what did we learn?
(there I found regret amongst the trees)

Snaps of a life we had in the garden
We tear up the flowers
