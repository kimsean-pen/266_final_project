To you, my heart cries out Perfidia
For I found you, the love my life
In somebody else's arms

Your eyes, are echoing Perfidia
Forgetful of the promise of love
You're shared another's charms

With a sad lament my dreams
Are faded like a broken melody
While the Gods of love look down and laugh
At what romantic fools, we mortals be

And now, I know my love was not for you
And so I'll take it back with a sigh
Perfidia's one goodbye

Sock to me, baby

With a sad lament my dreams
Have faded like a broken melody
While the Gods of love look down and laugh
At what romantic fools, we mortals be

And now, I know my love was not for you
And so I'll take it back with a sigh
Perfidia's one goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
