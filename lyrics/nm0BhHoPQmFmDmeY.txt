Another battle's over
It's a million soldiers
They never rise again
We lost a million friends

You can't understand
If you weren't there
You felt different then
Marching off to war

Show no quarter
Delight in slaughter
Up for your last long ride
Maybe God's on the other side

Don't try to understand
If you weren't there
You felt different then
Marching off to war

Don't need no vindication
Fight for the nation
You know you're going to Hell
But you wear it well

You'll never understand
If you weren't there
You felt different then
Marching off to war
