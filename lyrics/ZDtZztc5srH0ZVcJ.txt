There's nothing inside
Not dead or alive
No feeling to find
Like I've been hypnotized
How do I see
A lot in the dark
When nothing is real
And I don't hear a heart

I can't wake up from this cold dark state
Of hopelessness, so numb to everything

It's under my skin
Living within
I'm chained to my mind
So undignified
Run from the tide
That's rising so high
Come wash me away
'Cause I've no will to fight

Time won't wait for me to bend and break
Don't want to be so numb to everything
(In this coma!)

I'm free falling and the black hole opens
Vicious circle leading me to lie
I keep swimming through an empty ocean
In slow motion, in slow motion
I'm free falling and the black hole opens
Vicious circle leading me to lie
I keep swimming through an empty ocean
In slow motion, in slow motion

Time won't wait for me to bend and break
Don't want to be so numb to everything
(In this coma!)

I'm free falling and the black hole opens
Vicious circle leading me to lie
I keep swimming through an empty ocean
In slow motion, in slow motion
I'm free falling and the black hole opens
Vicious circle leading me to lie
I keep swimming through an empty ocean
In slow motion, in slow motion
I'm free falling and the black hole opens

In this coma!
(I'm free falling and the black hole opens)
In this coma!
