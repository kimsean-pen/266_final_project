Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me
Oh oh oh

Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me
Oh oh oh

Don't worry 'bout
Don't worry 'bout me

I want you baby
but you always lie
Always complaining or contemplating suicide

I want you baby
but you don't even try
Always complaining said a bye baby bye bye bye

Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me
Oh oh oh

Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me
Oh oh oh

Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me
Oh oh oh

Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me
Oh oh oh

Don't worry 'bout
Don't worry 'bout me

When I saw you
I knew that I wanted you
But you're the kinda girl that you just can't get through to

Standin' by the corner in a mini skirt
You're the kinda girl that ya just can't forget

Now I'm sittin' here sad and blue
Thinkin' 'bout all that we been through
I gotta get away

Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me
Oh oh oh

Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me
Oh oh oh

Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me
Oh oh oh

Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me
Oh oh oh

Don't worry 'bout,
Don't worry 'bout me

I want you baby
But you always lie

Always complaining
You make the tears fall from my eyes

I want you baby,
but you don't even try,
Always complaining said a bye baby bye bye bye

Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me...
Oh oh oh

Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me
Oh oh oh

Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me
Oh oh oh

Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me
Oh oh oh

Don't worry 'bout,
Don't worry 'bout me
