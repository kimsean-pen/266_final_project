Verse 1

Just say the word and I would die for you
And I'll be a flower if you wanted to
Cause I never met anyone quite like you
I lose my head my heart starts pounding too
And all I had to do was look at you
At first sight

Verse 2
I'll be the motor in your car
And I'll be the fire in your flaming star
And I'll be the water in your waterfall
Cause I'd hit the ceiling I'd feel ten feet tall
And all I had to do was look at you

At first sight
All I had to do was look at you

At first sight

All I had to do was look at you
At first sight
At first sight
At first sight
At first sight
