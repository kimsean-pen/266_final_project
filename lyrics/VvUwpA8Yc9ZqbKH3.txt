I know that you don't love me anymore
I know that you don't love me anymore
I know that you don't love me like you did
Before, before

So I get higher than that party
That you hated in the valley
'Cause I'll never say I'm sorry
But, oh God, I am, I'm sorry

Now there's fire burning in the valley
Do you think you'll ever end up happy?
When the smoke clears, I can see the stars down here
Yeah, maybe they look brighter by the sea

But I know where I'm going in the valley
And, babe, I'm coming home to the valley
