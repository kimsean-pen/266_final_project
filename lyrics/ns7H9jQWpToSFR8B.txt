I Like The Way (The Kissing Game)
I Like the Way

Verse 1:
All summer long we've been together
And I never felt so good
Cuz when I'm with you
You're such a good time (yes it is)
And when you get next to me
You make my heart beat fast
You throw me bad when you smile
And when we're alone
I know we're in love
Cuz I can't get enough, cuz

Chorus:
(I like the way)
You kiss me when we're playing the kissing game
(I like the way)
You keep me looking forward to another day

Verse 2:
We've got it good
We have it all it seems
We're living dream, yeah
This is our time
This wasn't meant to be
Just you and me
This is still new
We're still young in heart
And breakin' too
But I know our love
Will always be there

Chorus:
(I like the way)
You kiss me when we're playing the kissing game
(I like the way)
You keep me looking forward to another day baby

Yeah
(I like the)
Keep me looking forward to another day
(I like the)
Another day
(I like the)
Oh I like
(I like the way)
The way you make me feel, baby
(I like the way)
I like the way, the way you love me, baby
(I like the way)
You kiss me when we're playing the kissing game
(I like the way)
You keep me looking forward to ano-ano-another day
I like (I like you) the way
You kiss me when we're playing the kissing game
I like (I like it) the way (you keep me looking forward to another day)
I like the way (repeat till fade)
