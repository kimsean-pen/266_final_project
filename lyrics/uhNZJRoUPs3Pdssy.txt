This morning I could hear the sounds
The city burning to the ground
Today I saw the sky come crashing down

I heard a whisper in my ear
It said come with me, away from here
And leave this burning buildings far behind you

But it was far too late
So it all came crashing down

I can see your shadow's much to far behind you
And I can see you're much too late

At night we watched the stars explode
The blackest sky we'd ever known
The moon came falling down just shortly after

The earth that we were standing on
Was burning and would so be gone
Unless the oceans started overflowing

I can see your shadow's much to far behind you
And I can see you're much too late [x2]

Woah [x3]

This morning I could hear the sounds
The city burning to the ground
And I could hardly even hear you breathe

At night we watched the stars explode with you

I can see your...

I can see your shadow's much to far behind you
And I can see you're much too late [x2]

Woah [x6]

At night we watched the stars explode with you
