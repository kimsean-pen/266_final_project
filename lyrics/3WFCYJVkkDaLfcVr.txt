I wish you'd be
As dirty as my car
I could be your ride tonight
I may not be (oh yeah)
Worthy of your heart
But I'll make you feel alright
So c'mon into the night
Follow, follow the lights
So let go of wrong and right
Cause who wants, who wants, who wants to dance all night?
Yeah, I'm a dirty car
C'mon now, crank that beat, turn up the music
First time in the front seat, just while we're cruisin'
C'mon now, crank that beat, don't stop the music
I wish you'd be
As dirty as my car
I could be your ride tonight
I may not be (oh yeah)
Worthy of your heart
But I'll make you feel alright
So c'mon into the night
Follow, follow the lights
So let go of wrong and right
'Cause who wants, who wants, who wants to dance all night?
Yeah, I'm a dirty car
Come ride with me, oh yeah yeah
C'mon now, crank that beat, turn up the music
First time in the front seat, just while we're cruisin'
C'mon now, crank that beat, don't stop the music
I wish you'd be
As dirty as my car
I could be your ride tonight
I may not be
Worthy of your heart
But I'll make you feel alright
I wish you'd be
As dirty as my car
I could be your ride tonight
I may not be (oh yeah)
Worthy of your heart
But I'll make you feel alright
Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah

Come ride with me, oh yeah yeah
