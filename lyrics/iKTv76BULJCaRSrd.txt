Big man standing behind an open door
Said, "leave your lady on the cement floor."

"Got some kicks, wanna take ride?"
I said, "Yeh,..."
"Take your pick, leave yourself behind."
I said "Yeh,..."

I've no fear but for falling down
so look out below, I am falling now
Oh please understand, I just need my friend
a way home.

Tried to walk, found a severed hand
recognized it by the wedding band.

"It's okay, do you want some more?"
I said, "Yeh,..."
"You'll see dragons after 3 or 4..."
I said, "Yeh,..."

"Understand, I'm not falling down"
I said, "Look around, the room's taller now,..."
I can't close my eyes, cause I see the sound
in waves, in waves, in waves.

In waves, lets me stay calm.
If I don't lose control
explore and not explode
a preternatural other plane
with the power to maintain.
Like a tear in all we know
once dissolved, we are free to grow
"What is human?,... What is more?"
I'll answer this
when I get home.
