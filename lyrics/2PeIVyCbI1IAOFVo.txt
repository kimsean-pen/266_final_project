Decaying moonlight in my veins
I hear the shrieks of ghouls
Riding the nightwind
The true believers gather
To feed upon the hanged witch

Fall asleep screaming every night
Lost in familiar, arid wilderness
An alien monstrosity
Looking upon through a still lake
Midst titan mountains
Its faces are legion its faces are mine

A vision of pandemonaeon
Feeding my insanity
A gateway to unknown realities
Iï¿½m entering the mouth of madness

The image of the goat still burns within
Its pale dead faces stares empty
Back at me as I gaze into
The darkest pools of the soul
Cold horror as sanity declines
The sentient creature is awake

The walls of reality are caving in
In my state of gnosis
I'm on the outside
Reaching for the ether
Chaotic winds of new revelations
The ritual is complete

A vision of pandemonaeon
Feeding my insanity
A gateway to unknown realities
I'm entering the mouth of madness
