you can't sit up
you fell too fast
you come at the right time
you come too fast
you bloom in spring
you move the sky
you've come in singing
you call me a liar

you were like a cloud
yes you are a flower
then you were a lime
now our love is sour
you were like a flower
you were just like a flower
then you were a lime
now our love is sour

don't give up (I owe you)
no don't give up
oh don't give up
don't give up (I owe you)
you were like a cloud

yes you were a flower
then you were a lime
now our love is sour
you were like a cloud
you were just like a flower
then you were a lime
now our love is sour

here I feel I wish I could just see it
the love the hate the things that separate
forcing conscious to conscious every small attack
it takes a small man to notice but not to act up
confrontation complication needs a foundation
I'm calm baby, I'm calm

you were like a cloud
yes you are a flower you move i love life is all we need
then you were a lime
now our love is so sour you move i love life is all we need
so sour
so sour

don't give up
no don't give up
oh don't give up
no don't give up
start again butterfly
start again butterfly
start again butterfly
start again, start again dear
