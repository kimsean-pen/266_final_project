I never wanted you.
I never wanted to.
I know I told you I did
In front of witnesses.
And then we lit one wick
But now I get my kicks.

I know you never suspected
Because I never said
Baby I was faking the whole time.
How could you ever have guessed it?
With no accomplices,
Baby, I was faking the whole time.

You know it isn't like me to be
Inflammatory.
But rather than let you think that I was
So naá¯ve, I'd have you believe.

I never wanted you
I never wanted you.
You never had my heart.
Our love was never true.

I know you never suspected
Because I never said, but
Baby, I was faking the whole time
How could you ever have guessed it?
With no accomplices,
Baby, I was faking the whole time.

No we never connected
You only thought we did.
Baby, I was faking the whole time. (3x)
