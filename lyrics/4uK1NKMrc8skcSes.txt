Calm down, let the world spin round
There ain't no other place to be
Take this lifeline
Skin tears
But the flesh will weave
Back together again
Only scars now

Go easy, just be
As life gets longer
Got all the time you need
Stay with me my dear
As life gets harder
Whatever strikes, you'll heal
You will heal

Breathe out, let it come around
Let your colours return
Turn a corner
Every time he barks
Just shut the devil out
Let these arms embrace
You know I'm down

Go easy, just be
As life gets longer
Got all the time you need
Stay with me my dear
As life gets harder
Whatever strikes, you'll heal
You will heal

Stay with me my dear
As life gets harder
Whatever strikes, you'll heal
You will heal
You will heal
You will heal
