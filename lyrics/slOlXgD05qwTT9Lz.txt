Every night it's all the same
You're frozen by the phone
You wait, something's changed
You blame yourself every day
You'd do it again
Every night

There's something 'bout love
That breaks your heart
Whoa oh oh oh
It sets you free

There's something 'bout love
That tears you up
Whoa oh oh oh
You still believe
When the world falls down like the rain
It'll bring you to your knees
There's something 'bout love that breaks your heart
Whoa oh oh oh...
But don't give up
There's something 'bout love

When you were young
Scared of the night
Waiting for love to come along
And make it right
Your day will come, the past is gone
So take your time
Live and let live

There's something 'bout love
That breaks your heart
Whoa oh oh oh
It sets you free

There's something 'bout love
That tears you up
Whoa oh oh oh
You still believe
When the world falls down like the rain
It'll bring you to your knees
There's something 'bout love that breaks your heart
Whoa oh oh oh...
But don't give up
There's something 'bout love

Don't fight
Don't hide
Those stars in your eyes (in your eyes)
Let em' shine tonight
Let em' shine tonight

Hang on
Hang in
For the ride of your life
It's gonna be alright
Hold on tight

There's something 'bout love
That breaks your heart
Whoa oh oh oh

There's something 'bout love
That breaks your heart
Whoa oh oh oh
It sets you free

There's something 'bout love
That tears you up
Whoa oh oh oh
You still believe
When the world falls down like the rain
It'll bring you to your knees (to your knees)
There's something 'bout love that breaks your heart
Whoa oh oh oh...
But don't give up
There's something 'bout love
