Yeah, oh yeah.
Ooh, said I,
I'm comin' out to get you.
Ooh, sit down.
I'm comin' out to find you.
Ooh, yeah. Oh yeah.
Findin' My Way

I've been gone so long
I've lost count of the years
I've sang some sad songs,
Oh yes, and cried some bad tears.

Look Out, I'm comin'.
Whoa, whoa.
Look out I'm comin'.
Whoa, yeah.

I'm runnin',
Finding my way back home.
Oh yeah.

Yeah, oh yeah.
Ooh said I,
I'm comin' back to look for you.
Ooh sit down.
I'm comin' by the back door.
Ooh, yeah. Ooh yeah.
Findin' My Way.

You've done me no right,
but you've done me some wrong.
Left me lonely each night,
while I sing my sad song.

Look out, I'm comin',
Whoa, whoa.
Look out, I'm comin',
Whoa, yeah.

I'm runnin',
Findin' my way back home.
I'm comin'
Ooh babe, I said I'm runnin'.
Whoa babe, I said I'm comin'.
To get you, mama
Said I'm runnin'.

Ooh babe, I said I'm comin'
For you babe.
I said I'm runnin'.
Ooh yes, babe, I said I'm comin',
to get you babe, I said I'm comin'.

Ooh yeah,
I'm findin',
Finding my way back home.
Well, I've had it for now,
Livin' on the road.
Ooh, yeah.

Ooh yeah,
I'm findin',
Finding my way back home.
Well, I've had it for now,
Livin' on the road.
Ooh, yeah.
Ooh, yeah.
