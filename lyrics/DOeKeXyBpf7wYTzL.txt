I ain't no joke so you should get a pen,
And write yourself a little note so you don't forget again.
That when it comes to cash I've been getting smoked,
Lending out my money now I'm broke.
Somebody's getting choked 'cause now it's time to pay the piper,
Bums are the type of shit that's in a diaper.
Don't make me have to call a sniper,
And wipe your brains off my windshield wiper, you dirty bug.
As soon as I get paid they come in masses,
There's someone giving classes on kissing people's asses.
Unless you're living where the trash is,
Don't even come around here asking where my cash is.

Me, I'm broke!
Me, I'm broke!

I ain't no joke, I'll say it once again,
And if I get provoked there'll be knuckles on your chin.
Some people never learn borrowing from me you might regret it,
For one, I ain't no bank and you got shitty credit.
As soon as I get paid they're coming out the woodwork,
Take your ass and get a job like you should jerk.
Unless you're living where the trash is,
But you're not, so find another spot where the cash is.

Me, I'm broke!
Me, I'm broke!

Give me back my money, you bum.
You said you'd pay me back,
I'm broke and for that you deserve a smacking for slacking.
Now people say that I'm a slacker,
If I'm a slacker, it's through the eyes of the ones that are blind.
You said you'd pay me back,
I'm broke and for that you deserve a smacking for slacking.
Now people say that I'm a slacker,
If I'm a slacker, it's through the eyes of the ones that are blind.

I'm broke and for that you deserve a smacking for slacking.
Now people say that I'm a slacker,
If I'm a slacker, it's through the eyes of the ones that are blind.
Give me back my money, my money, my money.
You said you'd pay me back,
I'm broke and for that you deserve a smacking for slacking.
