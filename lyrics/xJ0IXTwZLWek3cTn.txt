you were s girl nice and sweet
never in trouble mommy
Little child who just couldn t see
the pressure from her so called friends
was simply too much
the monkey slowly climbed on her back
offering an aid for her pain
giving love and care
No one cared No one cared
fragile like a rose on the snow
eating all your strength and your money
walking in the shade day and night
never letting sunshinin in your eyes like before
