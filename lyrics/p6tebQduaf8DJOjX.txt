Pay day, you're a winner

Pay day, you're a winner
Keep cool, form a line
Scared money, broke money
Bow money, mo' money
So sunny, cloud breaker
Sound like a waverunner
Wild mother, funky drummer
You can get it how you wanna
There's math and there's dealers
And players and me
They say that they winners
Ok well, let's see
You player, you play
The rules of the trade
The math of the date
The times and the age
But you want how you like
Aim high, man, why not?
Sun, moon, starry y'alls
Each and all of y'alls

Mathematics and dealers
And players and me
They say that they winners
Ok well, let's see
