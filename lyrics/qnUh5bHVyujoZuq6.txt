Run, desire, run, a sexual being
Run him like a blade
To and through the heart, no conscience
One motive, cater to the hollow

Screaming, feed me here
Fill me up again
And temporarily pacify this hunger that's so cruel

Libido throw
Dominoes of indiscretions down
Falling all around in cycles, in circles
Constantly consuming, conquering, devour

'Cause it's time to the bring the fire down
Throttle all this indiscretion
Long enough to edify
And permanently fill this hollow

Screaming feed me here
Fill me up again
Temporarily pacifying

Feed me here
Fill me up again
Temporarily pacifying
