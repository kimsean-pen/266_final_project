Last night Your rhythm stopped,
and If I can't believe it
I might But I'll try Hold on You're going down slow
oh no I don't know You're going down so slow
oh no As you wave your hands goodbye
As you wave your hands goodbye
And dreaming was easier With you
But sometimes This life leaves you blue It's that rhythm in your heart
It's that rhythm in your heart That leads me down
It's that rhythm in your heart
It's that rhythm in your heart That leads me down
As you wave your hands goodbye
As you wave your hands goodbye
As you wave your hands goodbye
As you wave your hands goodbye
As you wave your hands goodbye
As you wave your hands goodbye
