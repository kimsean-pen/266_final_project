Dear little lad
Here is the story of my life
I lived on the moon (2x)

Grey flying snakes along
The mountains of destiny while
The three tailed monkeys
Were drawing the stars

Light from the sun and I
Hide myself on the dark side, alone
I've run so far
To find my way
Then I dream again... alone

Dear little boy, listen
To the voices of your soul
It showed you the way
Of silence and peace

Follow your thoughts and fly
Choosing all the things that you desire
Giant waves, fireflies...
Your dreams will be your only shell
Your secrets, your hiding place, my son
Don't let let them try
To crush your brain
Let you go far
... my son
