Take me into the night and I'm an easy lover
Take me into the fight and I'm an easy brother
And I'm on fire
Burn my sweet effigy, I'm a road runner
Spill my guts on a wheel, I wanna taste uh-huh

And I'm on fire, and I'm on fire
And I'm on fire...
(Im going, you tell me, I feel it, I say it
I'm heading back into the tunnel for my soul to burn)
And I'm on fire...
(I'm coming, you coming, no hiding, my feeling

I wanna take it to the highest over me, yeah...)
Wire me up to machines I'll be your prisoner
Find it hard to believe, you are my murderer
I'm on fire
I'm behind you
Heads up falling sky
And I'm on fire...
(I'm going, you tell me, I feel it,
I say it I'm heading back into the tunnel for my soul to burn)

And I'm on fire...
(I'm coming, you coming, no hiding,
my feeling I wanna take it to the highest over me, yeah...)
And I'm on fire, I'm on fire
Move on, you got to move on
You got to hit 'em to the hip
And get your shake on

Move on, you got to move on
You got to hit 'em to the hip
And get your shake on
(I feel it, I want it, I'm coming, I tell ya,
I caught the bullet from the heavens to the one you serve
I'm going, I'm running, out to the highest love
I'm wanna hit you to the hip...)

And I'm on fire...
Move on, you got to move on

You got to hit 'em to the lip
And get your shake on
And I'm on fire...
Move on, you got to move on
You got to hit 'em to the hip
And get your shake on
