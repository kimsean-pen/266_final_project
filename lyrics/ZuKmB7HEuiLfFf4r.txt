You were seventeen, pretty in the head
Sent in some photographs, this is what they said
Open your legs
Open your legs

You wanna be a model, and this could be a start
They're only jealous when they call you a tart
Open your legs
Open your legs

There's a demand, you're the supply
Dry your tears, that's why
Open your legs
Open your legs
Open your legs
Open your legs
Open your legs
Just open your legs
