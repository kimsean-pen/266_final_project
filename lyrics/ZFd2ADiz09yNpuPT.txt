Did all the words I never said
hurt as bad as those I did?
You know I never even cared not before you.
If I could go and turn back time,
If I could only press rewind
I would bleed this heart of mine
Just to show you

I'll be the first to say I'm sorry,
The first to say I'm stupid
Why do I always take it there
Is it hopeless or maybe you still want to
Meet me at the altar?
And I will lay it all to bare

And I told you all my secrets, all my fears, I've let go.
And it's flawless,
You are the only one,
You are the only one,
Don't you know,
Don't you know?

Am I faded from your mind
Has the distance blurred the lines?
They say all things heal with time
But its untrue
I will linger on every word
I know it's more than I deserve
Chances are I'll make it worse,
But I need to

Tell you
Tell you that I'm sorry,
Tell you that I'm stupid,
Why do I always take it there
Is it hopeless or maybe you still want to
Meet me at the altar?
And I will lay it all to bare

And I told you all my secrets,
All my fears, I've let go
And it's flawless,
You are the only one,
You are the only one,
Don't you know?

Don't you know,
That the hardest parts not having you to hold
This old heart of mine can't bare to see you go

And I told you all my secrets,
All my fears, I've let go
And it's flawless,
You are the only one,
You are the only one,
Don't you know?

And I told you all my secrets,
All my fears, I've let go
And it's flawless,
You are the only one,
You are the only one,
Don't you know?
