One, two, three, four

Two punks in love
You had my back from day one
We were so young
Your last off hit like a truck
A loaded gun
That Cupid knew what was up
And now I'm locked
Inseparable we've become

Even though the years go by
Seasons change and flowers die
We're still rocking side by side
I'm still yours and you're still mine

You broke my heart a million times
Can't count the ways I've made you cry
Always such a mess
But I get depressed at the thought of losing you

We were kids, it's been a while
But you still work to make me smile
A stolen kiss now I can't wait to waste my life away with you
You, waste my life away with you
You

Two punks in love
Growing pains from growing up
Your dad was drunk
Your escape was my house
Yours fell apart
They said their love was not enough
But from the start
We promise, we won't give up

Even though the years go by
Seasons change and flowers die
We're still rocking side by side
I'm still yours and you're still mine

You broke my heart a million times
Can't count the ways I've made you cry
Oh, we're such a mess
But I get depressed at the thought of losing you
We were kids it's been a while
But you still work to make me smile
A stolen kiss, now I can't wait to waste my life away with you
You, waste my life away with you
You (with you, with you)

Two punks in love
With a not so pretty low
Not giving up, not giving up, not giving up
Two punks in love
Burning up so pretty low
Not giving up, not giving up, not giving up

You broke my heart a million times
Can't count the ways I've made you cry
Oh we're such a mess
But I get depressed at the thought of losing you
We were kids, it's been a while
But you still work to make me smile
A stolen kiss now I can't wait to waste my life away with you
You, waste my life away with you, you
You, waste my life away with you, you
