In spite of what we'd seen, the signs stayed hanging up
The fire was a dream, still shadows climbing in us
We wander through the dark
On lines that had no start

When the light was born, it was a force unreachable
We live in a silence

It's in the burning leaves, the grey cold
Left on a rusted heap of halos
It's in the war we started and it goes on
And on and on and
On and on and

Now cradled in the fall, this whiteness blinding all
So take in what we lost, these times are caked on us

When the light was born, it was a force unreachable
We live in a silence

It's in the burning leaves, the grey cold
Left on a rusted heap of halos
It's in the war we started and it goes on
And on and on and
On and on and

Keep what the violence stole
The blind weren't blind at all
Now lie with the hottest hope
On and on and on and on

It's in the burning leaves, the grey cold
Left on a rusted heap of halos
It's in the war we started and it goes on
And on and on and
It's in the burning leaves, the grey cold
Left on a rusted heap of halos
It's in the war we started and it goes on
And on and on and
On and on and
