And they say all I rap about, bitches 'n' champagne
You would too if every night you seen the same thing
Money wall to wall, young famous nigga
Spend it all, when you die, you can't take it with ya

Bottle of rose if I'm drinkin' with ya
'Cause most niggas broke, their bank is injured
Then bitches gonna ride with who they think's a winner
'N' I'll be smilin' in case they take a picture

Oh, I'm smokin' weed, drinkin' liquor
Make a hundred off the show, 'n' spend it all on my niggas
When I go shoppin', I tell them pick one
'Cause they was with me when nobody seen a vision

Always about my business, don't play the card
I talked to the niggas who deal them, uh
Royal flush, now look up them niggas
'N', baby girl, you see us, yeah

I'm gonna spend it all (all)
Why wait for another day? (day)
I'ma take all this money I own (own)
'N' blow it all away (away)
'Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No, I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

I'm gonna spend it all (all)
Why wait for another day? (day)
I'ma take all this money I own (own)
'N' blow it all away (away)
'Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No, I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No, I can't take it when I'm gone

Look at all the ho's in my car, they wanna feel at that maximum speed
Never have a absence of weed
Tired of bein' at the bar, everything Louis V
Plus the most exclusive treat in my jar

Makin' my bank, spendin' it all
And that expensive shit you paid for, she had it on
She takin' it off, most of these niggas just talk and takin' it off
Back in the day, money was short, I'm makin' it taller

You know what I mean, some say it's a problem
Blowin' my greens, not savin' my collards
No NBA, they say I'm a baller
Live for today, it's not like my father

I'm gonna spend it all (all)
Why wait for another day? (day)
I'ma take all this money I own (own)
'N' blow it all away (away)
'Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No, I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

I'm gonna spend it all (all)
Why wait for another day? (day)
I'ma take all this money I own (own)
'N' blow it all away (away)
'Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No, I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No, I can't take it when I'm gone
