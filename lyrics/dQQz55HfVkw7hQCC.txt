Drown myself
Into sleep
Hands are
Tightly binded

Breathing dust
Grinding teeth
Senses are
Not Minded

I stand alone
In this house of glass
I watch the people
And the minutes go past
I cast a stone
To break the curse
To bring my memory back

Helpless minds
Will forget
The reason
We exist

Fragile bones
Paper skin
You choose to
Live like this

I stand alone
In this house of glass
I watch the people
And the minutes go past
I cast a stone
To break the curse
To bring my memory back
