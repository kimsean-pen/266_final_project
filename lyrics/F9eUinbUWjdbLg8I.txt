Paint yourself a picture.
Something perfectly obscure.
To hide away the messes
behind your manicure.

And all of my obsessing to find the perfect words.
Sick of second guessing. I didn't mean to make you hurt.
Didn't mean to make you hurt, hurt, hurt.
What do you say when your heart's not in it?
(Your heart's not in it)

What do you do when you just don't get it?
(You just don't get it)
Where do you go when you reach your limit?
(You reach your limit)
'Cause all I know, all I know is
You are my only one.

You are my only one.
You are my only one.
That's all I know. You're all I know.
Break another mirror.

To keep away the stares.
Of another guilty reflex
a reflection left in tears.
And all of my obsessing, tell me what was it worth?

Guess I should've learned my lesson. I didn't mean to make you hurt.
Didn't mean to make you hurt, hurt, hurt.
What do you say when your heart's not in it?
(Your heart's not in it)
What do you do when you just don't get it?

(You just don't get it)
Where do you go when you reach your limit?
(You reach your limit)
'Cause all I know, all I know is
You are my only one.
You are my only one.

You are my only one.
That's all I know. You're all I know.
Wake me early
I've been dreaming.

Dreaming that I'm only, only
good enough for me and no one else.
So wake me early
I've been dreaming.
Dreaming that I'm only, only
good enough for me and no one else.

What do you say when your heart's not in it?
(Your heart's not in it)
What do you do when you just don't get it?
(You just don't get it)
Where do you go when you reach your limit?
(You reach your limit)
'Cause all I know, all I know is
You are my only one.
You are my only one.
You are my only one.
That's all I know. You're all I know.
You are my only one.
You are my only one.
You are my only one.
That's all I know. You're all I know.
