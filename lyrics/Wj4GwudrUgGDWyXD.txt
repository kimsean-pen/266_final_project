You're dead but the world keeps spinning
Take a spin through the world you left
It's getting dark a little too early
Are you missing the dearly bereft?

Taking flight
And you could be here tomorrow
Taking flight
Well, you could get here tonight

I'm gonna fly on down
For the last stop to this town
What? I'm gonna fly on down
Then fly away, well, alright

Get down
Get down
Get down

Takin' a spin through the neighborhood
The neighbors scream whatchya talkin' bout?
'Cause they don't know how to let you in
And I can't let you out

What if I was not your only friend in this world
Can you take me where you're going
If you're never coming back

I'm gonna fly on down
For the last stop to this town
I'm gonna fly on down
Then fly away on my way

Get down
Get down
Get down

Why we take a ride away up
High through the neighborhood?
Up over the billboards
And the factories and smoke

I'm gonna fly on down
For the last stop to this town, yeah
I'm gonna fly on down
Then fly away on my way
Fly away

Get down
Get down
Get down
Get down
