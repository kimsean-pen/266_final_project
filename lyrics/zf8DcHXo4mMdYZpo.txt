Keep your voice down
Stop looking at my friends
Go out
They can hear exactly what you say

Drink, fall, spew
Telephone you
If you're alone in your room
What's that boy doing?

Head, cars, bending
Head, cars, bending

Can we go now?
Not staying till the end
Fall down
Write another song about your friends

Locking me in
Knocking me out
Talking like you do
And if you think you're helping me
Don't think I'm helping you

Drink, fall, spew
Telephone you
If you're alone in your room
What's that boy doing?

Head, cars, bending
Head, cars, bending
Head, cars, bending
Head, cars, bending
