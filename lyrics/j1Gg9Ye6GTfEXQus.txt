Carry them over your shoulders, you fear
The absence, the void you'll cause
When you choose to leave them all here
There's no turning back, it's time that you steer

The wide open stairs back alone at the cusp
The self that you thought you lost, the shine that burned well into rest
You can't hear my voice cause' I'm not loud enough

Believe me, when I say
It's a long way back from here

Goodbye for now
Hang on, it's clear that the roads about to get rough
Oh, can you hear its ringing its left in my ear?
Over and over, the light hits the dusk
It's a choice that I make but for us I choose to give it all up
You want me here? Well, then ask me to stay

The glistening wet concrete, the heat off the road
The clamoring hands and the bus you call home
This is it, believe what you want, in this space, I don't fit

The same day repeats with the things that you see
Dirty dressing room carpets and broken TVs
Is this it? In this water I'll tread til' the day that I'm dead

Hang on, it's clear that the roads about to get rough
Oh, can you hear the ringing its left in my ear?
Over and over, the light hits the dusk
It's a choice that I make but for us I choose to give it all up
You want me here? Well, then ask me to stay

Goodbye for now, echo, echoes
Mile marker, minutes, hours

If this is it and there is no more
And you believe that's true
It's a long way back from here
There's no going home

Hang on, it's clear that the roads about to get rough
Oh, can you hear the ringing its left in my ear?
Over and over, the light hits the dusk
It's a choice that I make but for us I choose to give it all up
You want me here? Well, then ask me to stay

(Goodbye for now, echo, echoes)
Well, then ask me to stay
(Goodbye for now, echo, echoes)
Well, then ask me to stay
(Goodbye for now, echo, echoes)
Well, then ask me to stay
(Goodbye for now, echo, echoes)
Well, then ask me to stay
