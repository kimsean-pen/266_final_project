If time isn't hunting us
Then why do we care?
If time doesn't come for us
Where do we go?

Sunrise on the run
Let it come, through your window
It's too late to stop
Let it come, let it be now

If time isn't hunting us
Why am I scared?
God isn't proud of us
For being dead

Sunrise on the run
Let it come, through your window
It's too late to stop
Let it come, let it be now

You can't do that to lose it
You're here for now
You need to turn and run
But who's to know
