When the world is on your shoulder
Gotta straighten up your act and boogie down
If you can't hang with the feeling
Then there ain't no room for you, this part of town
'Cause we're the party people, night and day
Livin' crazy, that's the only way

So tonight
Gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
An' just enjoy yourself
Groove
Let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall

Life ain't so bad at all
Live your life off the wall
You can shout out all you want to
'Cause there ain't no sin an' folks all gettin' loud
If you take the chance an' do it
Then there ain't no one who's gonna put you down

'Cause we're the party people, night an' day
Livin' crazy that's the only way
So tonight
Gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
An' just enjoy yourself
Step on and Groove
Let the madness in the music get to you

Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all
Live your life off the wall

Do what you want to do
There ain't no rules, it's up to you
It's time to come alive
And party on right through the night, all right
Gotta hide your inhibitions
Gotta let that fool loose, deep inside your soul

Wanna see an exhibition
Better do it now before you get too old
'Cause we're the party people, night and day
Livin' crazy that's the only way
So tonight
Gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself

C'mon and groove
Let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all
Live your life off the wall
So tonight
Gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
An' just enjoy yourself
C'mon and groove
Let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you livin' off the wall
Tonight
Gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
An' just enjoy yourself
C'mon and groove
Let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
