Like a gunshot from miles away
She's moving in
Like a rainstorm without the clouds
She falls on you
Like a phone call to warn the truth
It never rings

It's the truth before the lies
It's the way she doesn't try
It's the wink before the sly
In Philadelphia, in Philadelphia

They met after work one day
She laughed with him
They drove off their separate ways
Then met for drinks
When he got home
The silent guilt was deafening

It's the truth before the lies
It's the way she doesn't try
It's the wink before the sly
In Philadelphia, in Philadelphia

She thought that love was gonna fight
She thought that love was gonna take her home
She thought that love was gonna save her
But love just never showed

She felt that love was always watching
Oh, we learned that love was supposed to wait
But sometimes it's the feelings
That are standing in the air

He slips off his worn out suit
And tries to rest
She's a million miles away
Across the bed
She rolls over, puts her hand
Across his chest

It's the truth before the lies
It's the way she doesn't try
It's the wink before the sly
In Philadelphia, in Philadelphia
In Philadelphia
