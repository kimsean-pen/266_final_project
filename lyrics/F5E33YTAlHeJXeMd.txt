I could take you wanted someone to call your own
Sweet sixteen, you couldn't see straight
You couldn't let go
Now you're eighteen and you barely make a sound
You're getting older, a little bolder
You're in the lost and found

All the way you say you'll take me
Any day you'll never break me

Slip slip
Slip of the lip
I like the way you move your hips
Loose lips
Sink ships
The way you move, you don't miss

I said I told ya, I'll get to know ya
We're goin' all the way
Move over, I'm gonna hold ya
To everything you say

And now I've showed you baby everything's okay
When I hold ya and when I show ya
You're gonna want to stay

All the way you say you'll take me
Any day you'll never break me

Slip slip
Slip of the lip
I like the way you move your hips
Loose lips
Sink ships
The way you move, you don't miss

Slip slip
Slip of the lip
I like the way you move your hips
Loose lips
Sink ships
The way you move, you don't miss

Slip

All the way you say you'll take me
Any day, well, nothing to say
You're so bad, your reputation
You know it's all the same
It's just a game

Slip slip
Slip of the lip
I like the way you move your hips

Loose lips
Sink ships
The way you move, you don't miss

Slip slip
Slip of the lip
I like the way you move your hips

Loose lips
Sink ships
The way you move, you don't miss

Slip slip
Slip of the lip
