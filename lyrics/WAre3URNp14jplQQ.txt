Maybe i hate being alone
and holding you through the cellphone
and runin' hard from them miles
if i could break all the fast clocks
wouldn't make all the noise stop
could for a while

I'm probably gonna let you down
oh, oh oh

lying away to get the fever
call me a causer or believer
i will be loving you always, always, always
i bitter louder than thunder
if you have ever wonder
i will be loving you always, always, always

I'm looking for lights on the runway
can you forget my mistakes
and wade the blood from my hands
take me from the city of angels
all the stars and the famous
show me somewhere to land

I never wanna let you down
oh, oh, oh

lying away to get the fever
call me a causer or believer
i will be loving you always, always, always
i bitter louder than thunder
if you have ever wonder
i will be loving you always, always, always

I don't want to ever lose you
i will love you always, always, always
i don't want to ever lose you
i will love you always, always, always
oh, oh, oh

lying away to get the fever
call me a causer or believer
i will be loving you always, always, always
i bitter louder than thunder
if you have ever wonder
i will be loving you always, always, always

i don't want to ever lose you
i will love you always, always, always

don't know how we got to this place
but i'll be loving you always
and i always will
