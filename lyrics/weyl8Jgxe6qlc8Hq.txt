Weather worn
Jagged heart and ragged soul
Wind swept spirit soaring
High in the raging gale
Tired and torn
Treacherous tides across the shore
Rushing stream, your lifeblood
Winds through this wintervale

In the darkness lingers the afterglow
An alleviating light
Caught a glimpse of fire on the distant shore
In the night

Is there land beyond my dreams
Underneath a starlit sky
This one cannot, so it seems
Righteousness restore
Sail into the west
Until landfall gratify
Lay me down to rest
On the sunset shore

Ages passed, this receding rainbow goal
Any quest or journey seeking it foaled to fail

It's so far away and so long ago
Lives lay buried that shone bright
Now the shore is burning into the sky
In the night

Is there land beyond my dreams
Underneath a starlit sky
This one cannot, so it seems
Righteousness restore
Sail into the west
Until landfall gratify
Lay me down to rest
On the sunset shore

Long ages passed though no one came
Good visions last through hunger and pain

Is there land beyond my dreams
Underneath a starlit sky
This one cannot, so it seems
Righteousness restore
Sail into the west
Until landfall gratify
Lay me down to rest
On the sunset shore
