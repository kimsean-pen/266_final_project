Did you think
my life would end that day
that you walked out
when you broke my heart?
Did you think
I couldn't make it through
ooh -- without you?
Did you think
you'd stop my world with goodbye, oh no
Did you think I'd crumble inside?

Not me, I'm still breathing
and this heart of mine is still beating
And I, I'm not feeling any pain
No baby, not me, I'm still breathing
This old heart of mine is still beating
The tears I've cried have dried
You have gone and I've survived
I'm still breathing (yeah.)

There were times
when it took all my strength
to just get through, yeah
through another day
There were so many nights
I thought that I was gonna die
without you
But the tears I've cried somehow
made me strong -- so strong

Did you think I couldn't go on?

Not me(oo baby)I'm still breathing(I'm still breathin')
and this heart of mine is still beating(still beatin')
And I, I'm not feeling(oo babe) any pain
No baby(no, no, no)not me, I'm still breathing(still breathin')
You have gone and I've survived

I'm still breathing (yeah.ye.eee)

You tried to cut me down(cut me down babe)
but look who's still around(yeah, yo)
without you
Did ou think you'd stop my world
with goodbye, no baby

Did you think I'd crumble
just crumble inside?

Not me(oo baby no), I'm still breathing(I'm still breathing)
and this heart of mine is still(is still, still beatin') beating
And I, I'm not feeling(I'm not feelin')any pain
No baby, not me(no), I'm still breathing(I'm still breathin')
This old heart of mine is still beating
The tears I've cried have dried
You have gone and I've survived
I'm still breathing (yeah.)
The tears I've cried have dried
You have gone and I've survived
I'm still breathing
