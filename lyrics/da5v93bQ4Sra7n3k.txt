We were seventeen and invincible
Had the world figured out
And the girl on my shoulder told me
"Everything's gon' be alright"
And everything was gonna be alright

Yeah, maybe we were in highschool
But you never see the ending
When you're young and not pretending singing
"Everything's gon' be alright"
And everything was gonna be alright

Buried her deep inside
Stars don't kill my eyes

Now she's got a boyfriend
And I've got a rock band
'Cause nothing really ever goes the way it's planned
Yeah, she's in Ohio and I'm on some back road
Driving to this city and then who knows
'Cause that's all she wrote
"I wish that I could turn this car around"
But she's got a boyfriend now

Then I took a trip out to L.A.
For the girl with a smile
That could take your breath away, I'm thinking
"Everything's gon' be alright"
And everything was gonna be alright

Maybe I thought I could sweep it
And sweep her out her feet and go right back to Boston thinking
"Everything's gon' be alright"
And everything was gonna be alright

The streets keep holding on
But now she's so far gone

Now she's got a boyfriend
And I've got a rock band
'Cause nothing really ever goes the way it's planned
Yeah, she's on the west coast and I'm on some back road
Driving to this city and then who knows
'Cause that's all she wrote
"I wish that I could turn this car around"
But she's got a boyfriend now

Take me back to you somehow and everything that I don't know
It's so hard
I tore us apart
Take me back to feeling like the world would just keep dealing me the right cards
Now you're just so far and I'm

Twenty-three and invincible
Got the world figured out
And the bird on my shoulder told me
"Everything's gon' be alright"
And that means everything gon' be alright

Now she's got a boyfriend
And I've got a rock band
'Cause nothing really ever goes the way it's planned
Yeah, she's in Ohio and I'm on some back road
Driving to this city and then who knows
'Cause that's all she wrote
"I wish that I could turn this car around"
'Cause there she goes
(She goes)
I wish that I could press rewind somehow
But she's got a boyfriend now

She's got a boyfriend now
She's got a boyfriend now

Take your
Take your breath away

Take your
Take your breath away

'Cause she's got a boyfriend now
