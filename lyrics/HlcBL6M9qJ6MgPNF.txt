In the ground, we bury
The seeds of a pear tree
All the things we carried
Now we're down to our bare feet

May I have this dance?
To make it up to you
Can I say something crazy?
I love you
Give me both your hands
To make it up to you

We are bound to inherit
(Ooh)
The sins of our parents
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
Now we're down to the last two

May I have this dance?
To make it up to you
Can I say something crazy?
I love you
Give me both your hands
To make it up to you

To make it up to you
Dance
To make it up to you
Ooh

May I have this dance?
To make it up to you
(Can I say something crazy?)
Can I say something crazy?
I love you
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
(To make it up to you)
Give me one more

To make it up to you
Never gonna stay
Can I say something crazy?
I love you
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
(To make it up to you)
Give me one more
