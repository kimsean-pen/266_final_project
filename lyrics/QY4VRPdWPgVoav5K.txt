I've been searchin', searchin', searchin' for Celine'
I've been searchin', searchin' for her company

Find her where she's workin'
Find her where she hides
I know why she's cursin'
She knows why I lie

I've been searchin', searchin', searchin' for Celine
I've been searchin', searchin' for her company

Find her where she's sleepin'
I know why she's tired
I know why she's cursin'
She knows why I lie

She said, love is like a gun
And in the hands of someone like you
I think it'd kill
But oh, what a thrill, oh, what a thrill
No oh!

I've been talkin', talkin', talkin' in my sleep
I've been talkin', talkin', talkin' to Celine
Talkin' 'bout your love, talkin' 'bout your love
Talkin' 'bout your love, do you know what I said?

I said, love is like a gun
And in the hands of someone like you
I think it'd kill
But oh, what a thrill oh, what a thrill
Oh, oh!
