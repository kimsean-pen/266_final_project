Ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh

Innocence burned, a line on the stake
Tortured and dumped in nameless graves
Centuries waned, authority died
Scattering seeds of ancient lies

Sinister rouge, comin' back for more
(Ohh ohh ohh ohh)
To even the score
Sinister rouge, comin' back for more
(Ohh ohh ohh ohh)
To even the score

Child molesters and Jesuits
Holding secret conference
Underneath the Pontiff's nose
And only God will ever know

Sinister rouge, comin' back for more
(Ohh ohh ohh ohh)
To even the score
Sinister rouge, comin' back for more
(Ohh ohh ohh ohh)
To even the score

Ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh

Give us this day our daily bread
A legacy we'll not forget
Lick the wounds, cleanse the land
The modern world rejects your hand

Sinister rouge, comin' back for more
(Ohh ohh ohh ohh)
To even the score
Sinister rouge, comin' back for more
(Ohh ohh ohh ohh)
To even the score

Sinister rouge
Sinister rouge
Sinister rouge
Sinister rouge
Sinister rouge
(Ohh ohh ohh ohh)
Sinister rouge
The nightmare comes in sinister rouge
