I've been walking down the street
With a tambourine on my feet
I'm holding every beat steady and low
Well if it would've been me
I would have turned into the factory
And chase that little girl black and blue

Now I'm bleeding
And I'm freezing
And I'm crying once again
For Monday glass
For Monday glass

So if you see me on the street
Don't ask me about my passing days
Just slip another coin
And walk away

Lalalalalalalalala...

I once had a love of mine
With a different heart
In another time
I blew that all with pills and alcohol

I once had a child of mine
With a different heart
In another time
I blew that off with booze and lack of soul

Now I'm bleeding
And I'm freezing
And I'm crying once again
For Monday glass
For Monday glass

So if you see me on the street
Don't ask me about my passing days
Just slip another coin
And walk away
Yeah slip another coin
And walk away

Lalalalalalalalala...
