slit your wrists to bleed out slow
inside your sadness inside your home
fake it til you're real
you can't recognize yourself in anything
satan is your master now

patient suicide
is what you know to feel inside
fake it til you're gone
you can't recognize yourself anymore
satan is your master now

bleed inside for him
live for no one
