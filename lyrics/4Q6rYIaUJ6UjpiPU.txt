There is no place for blood in my space
Don't be so cold with those you want
There is no place for blood in my space
Don't be so cold with those you want

I feed you with my lies
Dressed up only in light
I dance for you all night
Then i die
I feed you with my lies
Dressed up only in light
I dance for you all night
Then i die

Now take off your clothes
Who are you?
Just a body
Take off all your dreams
Who are you?
Just a body

You are a monster
My favorite monster
Come to me closer
Say your true name
You are a monster
My favorite monster
Come to me closer
Say your true name

There is no place for blood in my space
Don't be so cold with those you want
There is no place for blood in my space
Don't be so cold with those you want

I feed you with my lies
Dressed up only in light
I dance for you all night
Then i die
I feed you with my lies
Dressed up only in light
I dance for you all night
Then i die

You are a monster
My favorite monster
Come to me closer
Say your true name
You are a monster
My favorite monster
Come to me closer
Say your true name
