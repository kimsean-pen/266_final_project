I often counted every reason
For why we'd never meet again
Pure and simple said the meaning
That evening, guess whose walking in
You asked if I remember
That December
And what you gave to me
You asked if I kept it
If I felt it all the same
But you didn't even have to ask
You didn't even have to ask
'Cos I kept it and we went our seperate ways
And there isn't a day
There isn't ever a day
Well I guess that it's been too long
To argue now over the rhytm of the rain
Goes to show that all I'm feeling
For every dream a new dream came
You said you must be leaving
I watched you turn away
Just tell me you meant it
That you felt it all the same
That I didn't even have to ask
I didn't even have to ask
Cos you kept in your own seperate way
And there isn't a day, there isn't ever a day
You asked if I kept, if I felt it all the same
But you didn't even have to ask
You didn't even have to ask
Cos I kept and we went our seperate ways
And there isn't a day, there isn't ever a day
There isn't a day, there isn't ever a day
There isn't a day, there isn't ever a day
