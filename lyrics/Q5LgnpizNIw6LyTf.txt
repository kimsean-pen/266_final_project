"No" is the utterance duly
strangled by omnipotence
Dire comebacks call a halt
to any visions of furtherance

Doggedly scoured away
like a stubborn stain

For I am a product inferior
to inferior product
I am snarled in the links
of your supply chains

Malcontent
Left to spread
Treat as stubborn stains

Of molestation and machinery and man
No molestations in those
quirky ad campaigns

I am long pinned down
You'll find me under buildings and
your tawdry, hateful malpractice
I am long pinned down
I am the invisible smear on your
sorely tempting price tag
And as perishable as your product,
I can just be thrown away
I am the invisible smear

Treat as stubborn stains

Spurious lament
Without a neck to hang their
corporate heads in shame
They will breeze on through
quite unscathed
Turn a profit and turn away

Of molestation and machinery and man
Short-lived stubborn stain
