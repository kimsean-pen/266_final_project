Imagination, that's the way that it seems
Man can't only live in his dreams
Oh, it seems so hard

If I'd lived a thousand times before
And if I'm gonna live anymore
Always brings me down

Everyone wants to live forever
Thinkin' that it'd be a lot better
Everyone wants to live forever, whoa

The feeling in my head starts heading South
It seems it stops the fever from shootin' out of my mouth
Life gushing all around

Everyone wants to live forever
Thinkin' that it'd be a lot better
Everyone wants to live forever, whoa

Everyone wants to live forever
But no one ever gets it together
And everyone wants to live forever, whoa

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
