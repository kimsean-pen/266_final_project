Do you see me
Do you feel me like I feel you
Call your number
I cannot get through
You don't hear me
And I don't understand
When I reach out
I don't find your hand

Were they wasted words
And did they mean a thing
And all that precious time
But I still feel so in between

CHORUS:
Someday, I just keep pretending
That you'll stay
Dreaming of a different ending
I wanna hold on
But it hurts so bad
And I can't keep something that I never had

I keep tellin' myself
Things can turn around with time
And if I wait it out
You could always change your mind
Like a fairy tale
Where it works out in the end
Can I close my eyes
Have you lying here again
Then I come back down
Then I fade back in
Then I realize
It's just what might have been

(chorus)

Am I a shadow on your wall...
Am I anything at all...
Anything to you~?
Am I a secret that you keep...
Do you dream me while your sleeping...
After all~?
Someday, I just keep pretending
That you'll stay
Dreaming of a different ending
I wanna hold on
But it hurts so bad
And I can't keep something that I never had
That I never had
I wanna hold on but it hurts so bad
And I can't keep something that I never had

You don't see me...
you don't feel me like I feel you
