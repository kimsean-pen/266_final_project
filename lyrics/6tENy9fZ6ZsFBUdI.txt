I've never been baby
I've never been
See I never, never know
I never know

Pardon me, excuse me, forgive me, I can't help it
But I see, the energy between you and me and I'm selfish
Don't want no other girls calling you, never ever
'Cause I want us to stay together forever

See I've never been, I've never been touched like this, no no
I've never been, I've never been kissed like this
I've never been, I never knew it felt like this
I never knew, I never knew a love like this

Believe me when I say
There's no one, I mean none
That can do, the things you do
The things you did and get done

And I believe that I can feel
This way for a reason
In all the ways you make me feel
Boy, you keep me breathin'

I've never been touched like this, oh no
I've never been, I've never been kissed like this
I've never been, I never knew it felt like this
I never knew, I never knew a love like this

What you got? What you got, them others don't?
'Cause you're the one I want
You're the only one I love
You're the only one I want baby

You make me hot, them others don't
'Cause baby you're the one I love
See you're the only one I love
You're all that I think of

I've never been touched like this, no no
I've never been, I've never been kissed like this
I've never been, I never knew it felt like this
I never knew, I never knew a love like this

I've never been touched like this
I've never been, I've never been kissed like this
I've never been, I never knew it felt like this
I never knew, I never knew a love like this

'Til I got you baby
Roll with me
And a one, two, three
Mary J. Blige, baby
