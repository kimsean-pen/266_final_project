Tryna make it through the wall
Tryna make it through the wall
But you can see me if you're tall
But you can see me if you're tall

Tryna make it through the wall
Tryna make it through the wall
But you can see me if you're tall
But you can see me if you're tall
Lookin' over

Tryna make it through the wall
Tryna make it through the wall
But you can see me if you're tall
But you can see me if you're tall

Tryna make it through the wall
Tryna make it through the wall
You can see me if you're tall
You can see me if you're tall
Lookin' over

And I know that I'm in space
And I know that it's not real
It's just the way that I feel
It's just the way that I feel

And I know that I'm in space
And I know that it's not real
It's just the way that I feel
It's just the way that I feel
Lookin' over

Tryna make it through the wall
Tryna make it through the wall
You can see me if you're tall
You can see me if you're tall

Tryna make it through the wall
Tryna make it through the wall
But you can see me if you're tall
Well, if you're tall
Lookin' over

Lookin' over
Lookin' over
Lookin' over
Lookin' over
