Practice makes perfect
Yes, I can prove it
Business or pleasure
The more that you do it

Please, dress in your best things
This course was unplanned
'Cos you see up in my bedroom
I've got Sarah Bernhardt's hand

Practice makes perfect
I've done this before
Never for money
Always for love

Please, dress in your best things
And don't make a fuss
'Cos you see up in my bedroom
Sarah's waiting for us

Waiting for us
Waiting for us
Waiting for us
Waiting, waiting, waiting for us
Waiting, waiting, waiting for us
Waiting, waiting, waiting for us
Waiting, waiting, waiting for us
Waiting, waiting, waiting for us
Waiting, waiting, waiting for us
Waiting, waiting, waiting for us
Waiting, waiting, waiting for us
