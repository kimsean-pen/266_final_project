O Lord, my God,
When I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds
Thy Hands have made
I see the stars,
I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed

When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow with humble adoration
And then proclaim, my God, how great Thou art

Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, (how great Thou art)
How great Thou art, (how great Thou art)
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, (how great Thou art)
