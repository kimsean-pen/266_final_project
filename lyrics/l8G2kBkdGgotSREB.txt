"Where you gonna go
Where you gonna run
Where you gonna hide
Nowhere
Cause there's no one like you left
That's right"

Evil spirits taking over now they running through my head
Telling me grip that fucking gun
Telling me pop that fucking lead
It's a bird, it's a plane
No, it's Satan in the flesh
I'm that dead motherfucker steady smoking on that death
Satanic holy ghost
Snort that holy dope
Infrared scope with that dot right on your throat
I'm that scarecrow in the corner
Welcome to my crucifixion
Graveyard living
Murder itching
Don't be superstitious
Demons got my back, I don't even fight it now
Black magic
Voodoo power
$uicide's exciting now see?

(Fuck rap and fuck a rapper)
Glocks poppin' bustas droppin' niggas duckin' from this shit
(Lets put em all on a fucking hole)

I'd rather take a nap after I turn a blunt to ash
Creeping cracker on the chronic
Feeling like a Velociraptor
Pulling off the patch, but I ain't taking off the fucking mask
Heard 'em gasp
Closed their mouth with the fucking gat's blast
Can't rap about a fine dime's ass no more
G9 where the beast's signs fine
Fuck a feast, I'm fine dying
Life gave me lemons, but I want a fucking lime
Ain't got the time to die trying
Bitch, I know I'll die alone
Either in a ditch or on a throne
Either way in a pit I'm being thrown
Everything is nothing and I'm fucking decomposed
