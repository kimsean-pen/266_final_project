Reasons only knew
When I talk about it, Aries or
Treasons all renew

Reasons only knew
When I talk about it, Aries or
Treasons all renew

If we can get around it
I know that it's true

Well I talked about it, put it on
Never was it true
But it's you
I fell into

Well I talked about it, put it on
Never was it true
But it's you
I fell into
I fell into
