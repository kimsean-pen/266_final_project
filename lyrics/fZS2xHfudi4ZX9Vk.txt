Tainting a picture of us now
Forever forgive
'Cause Little Missy Misery set foot in the ocean
But never the sea
I'll bury her under the ground
Next to the old lemon tree
For the fruits have grown sour and bitter
That no one would eat

Call her back and call myself a freak
Bend the rules so I can show her home
Shave my head and change the way i think of
The way I feel
The way I feel
The way i feel

Call to her heart I will offer my shield
The sour has turned into sweet
Let not the wheat in this garden grow tall
For they will choke the lemon tree

Months will go on
like sand to stone
maybe I'll grow old
Maybe I won't

Call her back and call myself a freak
Bend the rules so I can show her home
Shave my head and change the way i think of
The way I feel
The way I feel
The way i feel

Call to her heart I will offer my shield
The sour has turned into sweet
Let not the wheat in this garden grow tall
For they will choke the lemon tree
