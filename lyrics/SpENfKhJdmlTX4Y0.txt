You're intoxicating
Intoxicating
You're intoxicating
Intoxicating

Time is changing
The view in my window
But I'm still alone
Butting my pillows
You vanished away
Like a cigarette smoke
I hate the silence
And the wild ticking clocks

The sore, wanting body
Is curling in pain
The full, greedly lips
Are burning in flames
The thoughts of you
Sweet agonizing torture
I invented you
And you are so perfect
You're perfect
You're perfect
You're perfect
You're perfect
You're perfect

The ground vibrates
Beneath my feet
You're in my head
You are so deep
Madness in my veins
Explosions in my brain
Cocooned in my own thoughts
I still hear your whispery voice
Intoxicating waves
Block my heavy breath

Wild magnets make me isane
Punished with pleasure
Pleased with pain
Stoned by your spanking gaze
I crave the scent of you and me

Maybe it's time to lose my mind
Close my eyes and breathe you in
Maybe it's time to listen to my heart
Inhale the pain and let you in
Maybe it's time to lose my mind
Close my eyes and breathe you in
Maybe it's time to listen to my heart
Inhale the pain and let you in

Hope in the misery
Chaos in harmony
So far from you
But still so close
Colors in the darkness
Light in the dust
So far from you
But still so close
So far from you
But still so close

Get out!
Get out from my head
From my body
From my mouth
And from my bed
Get out!
Get out from my veins
From my dreams
Your sweet taste
Makes me insane!

Get out!
Get out from my head
From my body
From my mouth
And from my bed
Get out!
Get out from my veins
From my dreams
Your sweet taste
Makes me insane!

Two passengers
Between me and you
Keeping me away
From your roses
Learning a new language
To handle you
So far from you
But still so close

Get out!
Get out from my head
From my body
From my mouth
And from my bed
Get out!
Get out from my veins
From my dreams
Your sweet taste
Makes me insane!

You're intoxicating
Intoxicating
You're intoxicating
Intoxicating

The ground vibrates
Beneath my feet
You're in my head
You are so deep
Madness in my veins
Explosions in my brain
Please
Please just go away
Cocooned in my own thoughts
I still hear your whispery voice
Intoxicating waves
Block my heavy breath
Please
Please just go away

Get out!
Get out from my head
From my body
From my mouth
And from my bed
Get out!
Get out from my veins
From my dreams
Your sweet taste
Makes me insane!

Get out!
Get out from my head
From my body
From my mouth
And from my bed
Get out!
Get out from my veins
From my dreams
Your sweet taste
Makes me insane!

Please
Please
Go away
