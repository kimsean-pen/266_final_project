Take off your makeup, nobody's around
It's you and me, girl, just let your guard down
I see right through you, I know what it means
I know I got you, the moment when you close your eyes-ey-ey
I know I'm doing something right-ight-ight

I got you down to a t-shirt
White sheets, red wine
Baby you don't wanna leave
You want a record with some reverb, backbeat and low light
You know, I know what you need tonight
Girl I'll take my time-ime, dot every, I, I, Baby I, I
I got you down to a t

Mmm

Stay here 'til sunrise
I wanna know you
Like it's the last time I'll ever hold you
Girl, every detail leave it up to me
Lay back and let go
You don't even have to say-ay-ay Anything
About the way-ay-ay

You should see how you look in that t-shirt
White sheets and red wine
Baby you don't wanna leave
You want a record with some reverb, backbeat and low light
You know, I know what you need tonight
Girl I'll take my time-ime, dot every I, I, Baby I, I
I got you down to a t

Whoa, yeah, yeah

Got you down, got you down
Got you down, got you down
Don't worry baby
Cause driving you crazy is all I ever wanted

Now that I have you down to a t-shirt
White sheets and red wine
Mmmm
You want a record with some reverb, backbeat and low light
You know, I know what you need tonight
Girl I'll take my time-ime, dot every I, I, baby I, I
I got you down to a t

Whoa
I got you down to a t
Got you down, got you down
Got you down, got you down
I got you down to a t
