Hit the pavement and drive for the first time in a long time
And pray that everything works out fine
She said try to have a good time
And get your fill of cheap thrills
And try anything to save a dime
So let's get moving, and let's get grooving
To every single word we've grown to know
Until we get car sick, play our hands quick
And try to save ourselves along the way
You're a gamble
You've got nothing left to lose
You think you got me in the back of you pocket and you do
So take a breath and try to keep it down
'Cause I love these girls but I hate this town
But I'm positive that there's nothing about you to get to know
Hit the lights and get down for the last time in a long time
And try to think of every last line
She said, try to have a good time,
Don't put up with the hard hits,
They'll just hit you harder every time
That you get moving, you'll just keep losing
What little but of mind that you have left.
So try and please me, but take it easy
And try to keep your thoughts above the belt.
You're a gamble
And I've got nothing left to lose
You think you got me in the back of you pocket and you do
Take a breath and try to keep it down
'Cause I love these girls but I hate this town
But I'm positive that there's nothing about you to get to know
Oh!
You're a gamble
And I've got nothing left to lose
You think you got me in the back of you pocket and you do
Take a breath and try to keep it down
'Cause I love these girls but I hate this town
But I'm positive that there's nothing about you. TO GET TO KNOW!
