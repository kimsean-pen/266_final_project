Arms were rivers, through sinuous hills,
woe
Winds wore shivers and longing for thrills
woe
Veil the night wakeful stars blow dread astray.

Shake the dawn, aweless dare
throw along youngest stare
Arms reclaim stars unnamed.

Morning light reunites
fallen flames
a flawless frame
Through ember eyes

Over night, hearts arise
All the same
a solace shame
through

Veil the night,
Veil the night, wakeful stars
Reunite, arms reclaim
fallen flames.
