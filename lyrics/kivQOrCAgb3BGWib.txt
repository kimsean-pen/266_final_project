I stayed up 'till the sunrise to see if I could find myself
In the morning light, I left a piece behind
I wish I knew all of the answers
I wish I didn't want to disappear
I wish I didn't want to stay asleep
'Cause I could try to swim through my fears

I stayed up 'till the sunrise to see if I could find myself
In the morning light, I tried to pass the time
I wish that I could hold you close
You wish that I would let you in
Well I don't really want to talk right now
What if it's all in my head?
