The natural cards revolve ever changing,
Seeded elsewhere, planted in the garden fair,
Grow trees, grow trees.
Tongues of the sheer wind,
Setting your foot where the sand is untrodden,
The ocean that only begins.

Listen, a woman with a bulldozer built this house now.
Carving away the mountain whose name is your childhood home.
We were trying to buy it, buy it, buy it.
Someone was found, killed there, all bones, bones, dry bones.

Earth, water, fire and air
Met together in a garden fair,
Put in a basket bound with skin.
If you answer this riddle,
If you answer this riddle,
You'll never begin.

Born in a house where the doors shut tight,
Shadowy fingers on the curtains at night.
Cherry tree blossom, head high snow,
A busy main road where I wasn't to go.
I used to sit on the garden wall,
Say hello to people going by so tall.
Hello to the postman's stubbly skin,
Hello to the baker's stubbly grin.
Mrs. Thompson gave me a bear,
Brigitte and some people lived upstairs.

Skating on happy valley pond,
Various ministers and guards stood around.
The ice was nice, hello the invisible brethren,
And there was a tent you played cards with the soldiers in,
"Don't worry, we won't send anyone after you", they screamed.
But me and licorice saw the last of them one misty, twisty day,
Across the mournful morning moor, motoring away,
Singing "ladybird, ladybird what is your wish,
Your wish is not granted unless it's a fish.
Your wish is not granted unless it's a dish.
A fish on a dish is that what you wish."

Earth, water, fire and air
Met together in a garden fair,
Put in a basket bound with skin.
If you answer this riddle,
If you answer this riddle,
You'll never begin.
