The view is wrong for me
Is it wrong for you?
You keep me hanging on
But you're hanging on too

I'm hanging on for you

I've known of no tomorrow
Check it out
And I'll go a lonely sorrow
For an irascible bout

The view is wrong for me
Is it wrong for you?
You keep me hanging on
But you're hanging on too

Send in the suicide squad
Their uniforms are blue
Down on tranquilizer avenue

And you should know
It's a long way home

You keep me hanging on
But you're hanging on too
