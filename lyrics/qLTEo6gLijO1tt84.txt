I live in a town
All the buildings falling down
I live in a town of peace
And we believed this
If it isn't mine, then it's yours
It fits the key
If it isn't right, then it's yours
It climbed the trees to make his gone

Come on, come on
Say yes
Come on, come on
Say yes
Come on, come on
Say yes
Come on, come on

Summer came to pass
All I ask is where you were
All these things once started
Summer came to pass
All I ask is where you were
All these things once started for your heat

A mountaintop flooded
Third degree
And here we are

Oh admit it, you're there
The next man standing there
Admit it, you're scared
Of an ocean fractured tear
And we are the roots underground
But we are the fools falling down

Come on, come on
Say yes
Come on, come on
Say yes
Come on, come on
Say yes
Come on, Come on

If autumn sparks the pain you're feeling
If everyone's the same

Summer came to pass
All I ask is where you were
All these things once started
Summer came to pass
All I ask is where you were
All these things once started for your groove

Uh uh, sweet little thing
Off with your costume, on with disease
Uh uh, sweet little thing
Off with your costume, on with disease

On with disease
