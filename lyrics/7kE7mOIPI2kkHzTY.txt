I see you're locked down inside of your head
You've gotten tangled up in your own web
Your right is wrong, your flight is grounded
But, love never leaves a heart, where it found it, found it
You found it

Someday I'll fall into you
That's where I'll be now when the end comes, oh
I don't say, I hardly knew ya, oh
'Cause, where would I be, then when the end comes

Looks like you're living out on an island
Did you leave a number where I would find it?
You get along, your head is clouded
Your lungs are full of air but, you're drowning, drowning
You're drowning

Someday I'll fall into you
That's where I'll be, now when the end comes, oh
I don't say, I hardly knew ya, oh
'Cause, where would I be, then when the end comes

The part I'm holding onto would be the part that I'm losing, part that I'm losing for
My heart is going onto you so be the heart that I'm choosing, heart that I'm choosing
Someday I'll fall into you
That's where I'll be now when the end comes, oh
I don't say, I hardly knew ya, oh
'Cause where would I be, then when the end comes, comes, oh

Someday I'll fall into you
That's where I'll be, now when the end comes, oh
I don't say, I hardly knew ya, oh
'Cause where would I be, then when the end comes
