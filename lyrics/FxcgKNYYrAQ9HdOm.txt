Love in our life is just too valuable
oh to feel for even a second without it
but life without death is just impossible
oh to realize something is ending within us
Feeling yourself disintegrate
feeling yourself disintegrate
feeling yourself disintegrate
feeling yourself disintegrate
feeling yourself disintegrate
feeling yourself disintegrate
feeling yourself disintegrate
feeling yourself disintegrate
(feeling yourself disintegrate)
