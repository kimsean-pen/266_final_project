If I don't recover
Sell this house and find
Something lost outside your window

Not forever
But on the night I die I swear
I'll sleep outside your window

I feel the knife going in
I'm feeling like she's not enough to kill me
I thought it up and fast

But I'm feeling it now
And I feel like she's sleeping inches from me
I let it pass

And you should have stopped
Do you think I'll make it to the morning
If it's written 'Stitch it up'?

The kind of song I know
'Cause mother, sister, you're the worry"

I feel the knife going in
I'm feeling like she's not enough to kill me
I thought it up and fast

But I'm feeling it now
And I feel like she's sleeping inches from me
I let it pass

I feel the knife going in
I'm feeling like she's not enough to kill me
I thought it up and fast

But I'm feeling it now
And I feel like she's sleeping inches from me
I let it pass

Feel the knife going in
I'm feeling like she's not enough to kill me
I thought it up and fast

But I'm feeling it now
And I feel like she's sleeping inches from me
I let it pass
