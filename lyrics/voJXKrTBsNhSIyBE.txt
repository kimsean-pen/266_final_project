Deserted and still
Somber woods forsaken and lifeless
Starless is the sky
Fallen is the wrathful fire from above

No distant voice in the air
Winds carry only silence
No roar from the north
A howl from afar

Last of all Winters
Came without a Fall
Cold aeon eternal

Reaching deeper than ever before
World of fire
Frozen to the core
