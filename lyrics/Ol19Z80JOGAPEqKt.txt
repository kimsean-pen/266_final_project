Hey kid, who you lookin' at?
Why you standin' all up in my face like that?
You ain't never seen a baseball bat?
A maniac knockin' on your baseball cap?
You'd better step about ten paces back
Or you'll be layin' where your shoe lace is at
Go do what your momma told ya
And don't be actin' like a punk, thinkin' you're a soldier
I see you got yourself a cell phone
I got a number you can dial son, make it 9-1-1
Tell 'em "stop at Hef's house on the way" kid
"Pick up some playmates, but only if they're naked"
Don't know how y'all do in y'alls city
But 'round here we getting down to the nitty gritty
And I hate to put you out like that
But you've been burning like a fire with a mouth like that

Take me back to yesterday
Rollin' dice and getting laid
Everything was a-ok (go)
But now and then a cloud rolls in
Rains on my parade and then
Talking this and that again (go)

Let's break it down for a minute
And roll it on up in 3rd gear for a minute
I got the 21's rubbin' on my Benz, and
I got girlies in the back seat rubbin' on my friends, and
I don't really give a fuck about
What these player hatin' pussies give a fuck about
'Cuz I'm a night ranger, never been a stranger
My 2-way pager's lookin' for some danger
Zoolander, hit you with the magnum
Everybody get your groove on if you have one
And if you ain't got it then admit it
It's Limp Bizkit, time for you to get it
All around the world in this 45 Prevost
Everywhere that we go, we watch it on the tivo
And now you're laying in the bed you made
Drinkin' haterade, think about it

Take me back to yesterday
Rollin' dice and getting laid
Everything was a-ok (go)
But now and then a cloud rolls in
Rains on my parade and then
Talking this and that again (go)

Thinking that you're all that, and then some
I got news for you (all radio is dead)
So you're thinking that you're all that, and then some
Man, I got news for you (all radio is dead)
(Radio is dead)

Let me guess, you ain't that impressed
Mr. Halitosis of the breath
Livin' lifestyles of the wish you would from the
Back isles of the thrifty good, see I
Got room to talk kid
I've been laying this track since north cack-a-lack
And the very first day that you fell out the sack
I was in some fat laces spinnin' on my back
Let me think, let me roll, let me ride, let me
Put some funk in the trunk with a vibe, and a
Memory that can ease your pain like a
Melody from Kurt Cobain, 'cuz ya
Never know when it's all gonna end, and ya
Never know when you'll call on a friend
So you better take a step to prepare yourself
'Cuz the way you're livin' now ain't good for your health

Thinking that you're all that, and then some
I got news for you (all radio is dead)
So you're thinking that you're all that, and then some
Man, I got news for you (all radio is dead)
Thinking that you're all that, and then some
I got news for you (all radio is dead)
So you're thinking that you're all that, and then some
Man, I got news for you (all radio is dead)
All radio is dead
All radio is dead
All radio is dead...
