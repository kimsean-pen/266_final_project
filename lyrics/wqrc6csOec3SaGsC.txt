Typical and hardly the type I fall for
I'm liking the physical, don't leave me askin' for more
I'm a sexy mama (mama)
Who knows just how to get what I wanna (wanna)
What I wanna do is bring this on ya (on ya)
Backup all the things that I told ya (told ya, told ya, told ya)

You been sayin' all the right things all night long
But I can't seem to get you over here to help take this off
Baby can't you see (see)
How these clothes are fittin' on me (me)
And the heat comin' from this beat (beat)
I'm about to blow, I don't think you know

You say you're a big boy, but I can't agree
Cuz the love you said you had ain't been put on me
I wonder (wonder)
If I'm just too much for you, wonder (wonder)
If my kiss don't make you just wonder (wonder)
What I got next for you what you wanna do

Take a chance to recognize that this could be yours
I can see just like most guys that your game don't please
Baby can't you see (see)
How these clothes are fittin' on me (me)
And the heat comin' from this beat (beat)
I'm about to blow, I don't think you know
