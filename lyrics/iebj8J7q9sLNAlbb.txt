Through the tunnel where Jenni used to live in
Then you make a right
Down at the car rentals and the tar decks
You don't go after dark, but that summer
You said M, there's something I really want to show you
Put your coat on, I'll wait downstairs
You're not gonna believe it

When we dance, it takes me back again
To the nights, when we met, under the bridges
When we dance, it takes me back
To the nights under the bridges

Jenni said I don't wanna go home yet,
They always pull a fight
Ooh baby you're just like a nightbird,
You'll take off and fly
Ooh but that summer, that summer
I swore to never let you down

When we dance, it takes me back again
To the nights, when we met, under the bridges
When we dance, it takes me back
To the nights under the bridges

Oh oh oh oh
We are storming under, under the bridges, oh oh oh
It takes me back, it takes me back
It takes me back, oh oh when we dance

Under the bridges,
It takes me back again,
To the nights, when we met, under the bridges
When we dance, takes me back
To the nights under the bridges
