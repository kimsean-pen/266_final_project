When I scream at the top of my lungs
Do you love me? Do you love me?

Begging to cut me loose
And you're holding the knife
I'm drowning under the surface
You left me broke and bruised
Begging for my life
What did I do to deserve this?

You make me feel like I am worthless
Why can't I stop the bleeding?

When I scream at the top of my lungs
Do you love me? Do you love me?
When I scream "What have I become?"
Do you love me? Do you love me?

I'm hanging from the noose
Fighting to stay alive
I'm crawling back to the surface
Can't take much more abuse
Don't know if I'll survive
I did nothing to deserve this

You make me feel like I am worthless
Why can't I stop the bleeding?

When I scream at the top of my lungs
Do you love me? Do you love me?
When I scream "What have I become?"
Do you love me? Do you love me?

Falling for you is my biggest regret
The harder I love you, the sicker I get
When I scream at the top of my lungs
Do you love me? Do you love me?

I'm not worthless

When I scream at the top of my lungs
Do you love me? Do you love me?
When I scream "What have I become?"
Do you love me? Do you love me?

Falling for you is my biggest regret
The harder I love you, the sicker I get
When I scream from the top of my lungs
Do you love me? Do you love me?
