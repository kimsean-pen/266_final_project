I'm a lazy boy

I'm a lazy boy
I'm a lazy boy
Never cared enough in time, I enjoy
Being a lazy boy
Lying in your bed
Thinking of how
A lazy boy loves you

Am I gonna get up?
Am I gonna get up, get up?
Never!

Am I gonna get up?
Am I gonna get up, get up?
Never!

Am I gonna get up?
Am I gonna get up, get up?
Never!

Am I gonna get up?
Am I gonna get up, get up?
Never!

I'm a lazy boy
I'm a lazy boy
Always be a lazy boy
I'm a lazy boy
Yes, a lazy boy
Lazy in the evening boy
I'm a lazy boy that loves you

Am I gonna get up?
Am I gonna get up, get up?
Never!

Am I gonna get up?
Am I gonna get up, get up?
Never!

Am I gonna get up?
Am I gonna get up, get up?
Never!
Never!
Never!
Never!

I'm a lazy boy
I'm a lazy boy
Always be a lazy boy
I'm a lazy boy
Yes, a lazy boy
Lazy in the morning boy

Such a lazy, lazy, boy

Lazy in the evening boy
