I'm sorry for something I didn't do, lynched somebody
I didn't know who
You blame me for slavery
A hundred years before I was born

Guilty of being white
Guilty of being white
Guilty of being white
Guilty of being white

I'm sorry for something I didn't do, lynched somebody
I didn't know who
You blame me for slavery
A hundred years before I was born

Guilty of being white
Guilty of being white
Guilty of being white
Guilty of being white

I'm convicted of a racist crime
I've only served 19 years of my life

I'm sorry for something I didn't do, lynched somebody
I didn't know who
You blame me for slavery
A hundred years before I was born

Guilty of being white
Guilty of being white
Guilty of being white
Guilty of being right
