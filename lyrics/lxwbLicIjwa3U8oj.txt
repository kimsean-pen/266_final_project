When the willow bends
Towards the end of day
And twilight falls again
To the funny sound
That a blackbird makes
Twilight falls again

As no good reason remains
I'll do the same, thinkin' of you
([Inaudible])
One day a ship comes in
One day a ship comes in
But I can't say how or when?
But I know somewhere
The ship comes in every day

There is no Morphine
I'm only sleepin'
There is no crime to dreams like this
And if you could take somethin' with you
It would be right
Somethin' good

From my fingertips
The cigarette
Throws ashes to the ground
I'd stop and talk to the girls
Who work this street
But I got business farther down

Like one long season of rain
I will remain thinkin' of you
One day a ship comes in
From far away a ship comes in
One hundred days you wait for it
And you know somewhere
The ship comes in every day

There is no morphine
I'm only sleepin'
There is no crime to dreams like this
And if you could take somethin' with you
It would be bright
Just like somethin' good

One day a ship comes in
One hundred days you wait for it
Somethin' bright
Somethin' so good

One hundred days
A ship comes in every day
You know it's good
You know it's good
A ship comes in every day

One day a ship comes in
It's good
When it's somethin' good
