Don't try to take me away,
Like I can't live without you
Today,
Makin' love tomorrow

Some way,
Swooping you're so fragile
Die today,
You disgrace the mortal

Fight me lately, tried to someone,
We've been laughin' since you've been gone
And I want to know
Did you all enjoy the show?

It's so sad to see you go

...And you know!
I'm home!
Alone!
Always on his own!

Hangin' low today,
I replace the highway
Love's the only way,
Licking hands the wrong way

So I'd better see you go,
It's so sad to see you go, I jus' thought I'd let you know

...And you know!
I'm home!
Alone!
Always on his own!
