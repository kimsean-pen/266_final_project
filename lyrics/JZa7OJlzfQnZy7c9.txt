Thunder rolls across the plains
Thor rides in pouring rain
He rides to Jotunheim to fight
Lightning strikes when Mj√∂lner bites

Fire! burning in his eyes
Fire! his rage is pure, see the lightning strike
Fire! burning in his eyes
Fire! his hate is pure, see the lightning strike

Lightning cracks the blackend sky
Hear the thunder chariot ride
All brave men with hearts of war
Ride the path of mighty Thor

Son of thunder, lighting strikes, son of thunder
Son of thunder, Thor arise, son of thunder

Son of Oden
Thunder god
Master of war
Asator

Fire! burning in his eyes
Fire! his rage is pure, see the lightning strike
Fire! burning in his eyes
Fire! his hate is pure, see the lightning strike
