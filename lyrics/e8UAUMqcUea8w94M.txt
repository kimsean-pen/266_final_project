One creature I return to, one habit I neglect
I cannot slow the pace at which I yearn
Frank and I unabashed, I become a frozen servant
Smiling, asking nothing in return
Fang-tooth, woman foaming at the mouth as she addressed me
Not with moving lips, but with the rabid wild arresting
Words not yet intended to identify emotion
Scrawling bold and oblique in my head
Ive hung out at your service jobs
Ive watched you wait and be ignored
Bled into the clatter, as they sipped at what you poured
I cling to your perimeter as you float in their margins
Oblivious to being stung, there satellite becomes my sun
Ive flown into that trap before, when things have gotten dark
In the depths of stranger's glances lays the most ferocious spark

Most freedom is deceiving, if such a thing exists
When I was young I knew, but didnt care
Faces change and shape to represent the same old beast
I want to flee but I can only stare
Its the sound a captive heart makes as it sizzles into vapor
The title hum of fondness like a spike-wave oscillator
The rabid UV grin that beckons me into approaching
Grasping as it recedes into space
Who greets me first when I arive, who breaking into my half-shut eyes?
Its in the blaze of your embrace where I feel more real and alive
The bosom of one thousand watts into my skin into my guts
Running circles in my mind, now, on record, terrified
That porch we hit the first time, so badly, I died
In his brief emancipation he can feel what I cannot

Theres a patch of light that hits the floor, till it occupy(?)
Stretch my arms and legs and close my eyes
I now can hear my pulse alone, this manic pace I cannot slow
I do not miss the child you stole
Frying and abiding, Im in your control
Like a sunbathing animal
A sunbathing animal x6
A sun
