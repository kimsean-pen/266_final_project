I don't know your name
But I just want your fame
Just think you're really hot
And think that I can earn your trust
Here for a minute
There for a while
Your endless limits
Go on for miles
I wonder if he's in

I fell in love with the boy next door
I fell in love with the boy next door
I fell in love with the boy next door
I fell in love with the boy next door

I fell in love with
I fell in love with
I fell in love with
I fell in love with
Lunch, lunch, lunch, lunch

Take me for lunch, take me for dinner
Just take me out, you know I'm a winner
Vodka for days, vodka for years
We could just chat for a million years
Show me your friends, you know I'm the one
I'll let my hair down and we'll have some fun
Vodka for days, vodka for hours
I really think that this night could be ours
Vodka for you, vodka for me
Let's just drink up to the power of three
Vodka for days, vodka for hours
I really think that this night could be ours
Look in my eyes, look at my hips
If I was a dancer, I'd get the tips
Come to my show, look at me go
Feature me on and you'll get a good blow

I fell in love with the boy next door
I fell in love with the boy next door
I fell in love with the boy next door
I fell in love with the boy next door
I fell in love with the boy next door
I fell in love with the boy next door
I fell in love with the boy next door
I fell in love with the boy next door

Take me for lunch, take me for dinner
Just take me out, you know I'm a winner
Vodka for days, vodka for years
We could just chat for a million years
Show me your friends, you know I'm the one
I'll let my hair down and we'll have some fun
Vodka for days, vodka for hours
I really think that this night could be ours
Vodka for you, vodka for me
Let's just drink up to the power of three
Vodka for days, vodka for hours

Look in my eyes, look at my hips
If I was a dancer, I'd get the tips
Come to my show, look at me go
