The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in a sigh were we
The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly
I can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly

Your arms opened wide
And closed me inside
You took my lips
You took my love
So tenderly

Oh tenderly tenderly
Oh oh oh oh

Oh yes
