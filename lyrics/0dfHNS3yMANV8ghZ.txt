God of death can you hear me
Screams and cries of your lost children
Breathe death into me
Breathe death into me
Breathe death into me

Summon death from the mouth of the grave
Let them bleed, let them writhe, let them pray

Cast a spell upon the ocean
Watch the waves become flames
Cover the earth in fire and cinder
Absolution through the endurance of pain

A world painted black by death's own hand
Unholy undead reign hell upon the land
Bury me in blasphemy

A crown on a head filled with lies
Eternal lost souls, servants to the night
Bury me in blasphemy

Hand in hand we all die together
The end of all life dead forever
No rest for the soulless
No rest for the soulless

Cry to the heavens as hell descends
Saints might forgive but they'll never forget
Aeons of death, armies of the condemned
Mass grave burials, bringers of the end
No rest for the soulless
No rest for the soulless

Endless graves blessed with damnation
Ravens shroud a blood soaked throne
The end of salvation
Dead in the arms of the unholy ghost

Cast a spell upon the ocean
Watch the waves become flames
Cover the earth in fire and cinder
Absolution through the endurance of pain

A world painted black by death's own hand
Unholy undead reign hell upon the land
Bury me in blasphemy

A crown on a head filled with lies
Eternal lost souls servants to the night
Bury me in blasphemy

God of death can you hear me
Screams and cries of your lost children
No rest for the soulless

God of death can you hear me
Screams and cries of your lost children
No rest for the soulless.
