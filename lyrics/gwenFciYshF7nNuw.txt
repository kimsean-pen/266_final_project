Dance Apocalyptic (Woo!)
Bands that make her dance apocalyptic now
Bands that make her dance apocalyptic (Woo!)
Bands that make her dance apocalyptic now
Bands that make her dance apocalyptic

You're goin' crazy
The hitmen always find you
Do that dance
Smokin' in the girls' room
Kissin' friends
It's over like a comic book
It's floating in the bathroom stall (Ah!)

You're so freaked out!
Worried 'bout the bomb threats
You bought a house!
But I'm allergic to the house pets
Your credit cards
They bought a new wife
For shiny little lonely men

But I really really wanna thank you
For dancing till the end
You found a way to break up
You're not afraid to break out

But I need to know
If the world says it's time to go
Tell me, will you freak out?
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop!
Chalanga-langa-lang! (ooh chanlanga-langa-lang)

But I need to know
If the world says it's time to go
Tell me, will you freak out?

Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop!
Chalanga-langa-lang!

Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop!
Chalanga-langa-lang!

You gotta laugh
At the zombie in the front yard
Take a bath
But nothing gets the funk off
You're on tv
Rockin' and a rollin'
Cause the dead just love to rock and roll

Sick and tired
Of food tasting plastic
You want to cry
But they grew up without a real kitchen
Asking why
The pain is always equal
But the joy just never spreads around?
(Uh uh, uh uh!)

But I really really wanna thank you
For dancing till the end
You found a way to break up
You're not afraid to break out

But I need to know
If the world says it's time to go
Tell me, will you freak out?

Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop!
Chalanga-langa-lang!

But I need to know
If the world says it's time to go
Tell me, will you freak out?

Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop!
Chalanga-langa-lang!

Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop!
Chalanga-langa-lang!

You're goin' crazy
The hitmen always find you
Do that dance
Smokin' in the girls' room
Kissin' friends
Keep a rocking and a rolling
Cause the dead just love to rock and roll

So freaked out!
Worried 'bout the bomb threats
You bought a house!
But I'm allergic to the house pets
Credit cards, workin 9 to 5
And just to make enough to pay your rent

But I really really wanna thank you
For dancing till the end
You found a way to break up
You're not afraid to break out

But I need to know
If the world says it's time to go
Tell me, will you freak out?

Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop!
Chalanga-langa-lang! (oh baby, baby!)

But I need to know
If the world says it's time to go
Tell me, will you freak out?

Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop!
Chalanga-langa-lang!

Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop!
Chalanga-langa-lang!

Look at you!
You're just like a little old earthquake
Break it! Break It!
You got to break it!
Ain't no order in this court room

Smash, smash, bang, bang (you all going to jail)
Don't stop!
Chalanga-langa-lang!

What's the matter?
Your chicken taste like pork?
You have triplets instead of twins?
Does your food taste plastic?
Grandaddy, I think I wanna dance.
