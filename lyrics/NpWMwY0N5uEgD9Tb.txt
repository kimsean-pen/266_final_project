You will never see things how they truly are
You're stuck in your own world and of course, you're the star
How could you ever lose when you're playing me
I guess everything's easy when you're that crazy

Its 4 in the morning
I'm finding my own
You know you never said sorry
For all that you stole

Now I'm going away
And you'll never find me
5 years older today
Molding clay
Found you never knew me
Now i can find happy
Nothing to show but my name

If i could i would erase it all
You sat on your high horse and watched me fall
You got so many stories that you hide
Everything's so easy when it's all a lie

Its 4 in the morning
I'm finding my own
You know you never said sorry
For all that you stole

Now I'm going away
And you'll never find me
5 years older today
Molding clay
Found you never knew me
Now i can find happy
Nothing to show but my name

And when I'm lonely and tired
I'm holding on
Cuz now i'm out of your fire

Now I'm going away
And you'll never find me
5 years older today
Molding clay
Found you never knew me
Now I can find happy
Nothing to show but my name

Now I'm going away
And you'll never find me
5 years older today
Molding clay
Found you never knew me
Now I can find happy
Nothing to show but my name

Now I'm going away
And you'll never find me
5 years older today
Molding clay
Found you never knew me
Now I can find happy
Nothing to show but my name
