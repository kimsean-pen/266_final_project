You're home, you're home
You're home to me
So leave me, leave me
Leave me a map

I'm here at my cliff looking down
I cannot bear you a son, but I will try
For if I am not yours, what am I

I daydream I'd give one a name of my own
For I, even I, even I am alone

I have, I have, I watch a dream
Breaking, breaking, breaking me
Away from my cliff, I'm looking down from
I cannot bear you a son, I have tried
But if I am not yours, what am I

I daydream I'd give him a name of my own
For I, even mine, even mine is unknown

So let me go towards the morning star
With hope it won't disappear
