With so much gloom surrounding
I feel cornered up against the wall
Pulled down and slowly drowning
Taking bets I knew was next to fall

I saw the glass as half full
So I felt I could ask for more
I was comfortable
It spilled over onto the floor
I beg to comeback to before
With the damage done
And the damage won

Like a wave, like the rapture
Something you love is gone, something you love is gone
Like a wave, like the rapture
Something you love is gone, something you love is gone
Someone you love is gone, someone you love is gone
It leaves you fractured

I saw the glass as half full
So I felt I could ask for more
I was comfortable
It spilled over onto the floor
I beg to comeback to before
With the damage done
And the damage won

I saved the worst for last
I saved the worst for last
