Look at your angst
And your aggression
Look at your hate
And your oppression
Look at your age
Without any mastery
Look at your face
The final masquerade

Tell me what you were thinking about
Tell me, let's put this fire out
Tell me what you were thinking about
Holding, let's put this fire out

With your seduction
Look at your brave?
And that reduction
Is anyone outraged
Anyone at all
Anyone outraged
Anyone that can see through this wrong

Tell me what you were thinking about
Tell me, let's put this fire out
Tell me what you were thinking about
Holding?, let's put this fire out

Telling the rules you want so bad
They now sit within the grave?
Dead man's liberty
Let's put this fire out
Let's put this fire out
Loud and burning
(Bright lights in the dead of night)
Loud and burning
(Bright lights in the dead of night)

If I tell you it's right
Don't believe it, don't believe it
If I tell you it's right
Don't believe it, don't believe it
I've seen your hands, I've seen your plans
The dirtiest clean I ever did see
I'll take a stand from your command
The dirtiest clean, memory police

So tell me what you were thinking about
Tell me, let's put this fire out
