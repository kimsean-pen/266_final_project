A free love is a lie
But I take it anyway
A free love is a lie
But I take it anyway

Discomfort is so easily endured
A free love is a lie
Unlock my door
Make your home in my house
I am yours
But you keep nagging me to play

Despite what I adore
There's still a debt I pay
We take turns back and forth
I don't care if it's fake

Misled, it's easier to pretend
Draw my heavy mind on your blank white page
Misled, words are so easy to bend
Won't you change your mind and accept my way?

A free love is a lie
But I take it anyway
A free love is
A free love is a lie

You lock my door
You're not at home in my house
I'm not yours
It's over now, no time to play

Despite what I adore
There's still a debt I pay
We take turns back and forth
I don't care if it's fake

Misled, it's easier to pretend
Draw my heavy mind on your blank white page
Misled, words are so easy to bend
Won't you change your mind and accept my

Floating shapes are all I see
It's worse for you but it's easy for me

Misled, it's easier to pretend
Draw my heavy mind on your blank white page
Misled, words are so easy to bend
Won't you change your mind and accept my way?

A free love is a lie
But I take it anyway
A free love is
A free love is a lie
