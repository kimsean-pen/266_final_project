Come around as you are
Like a sad slow song on the radio conflicted and charming
Soft lips legs twitch in your car
You put a Deftones song on the radio and slip out of your clothes
You're talking to strangers and walking on razors
You block out the entrance (from the inside)
You're calling on danger
Your touch growing stranger
You block out the entrance (from the inside)
Just come around as you were
like a sad slow song on the radio
Who's short on whose leash and why's it feel so
right when you block out restraint and you stay tonight
Stay tonight (from the inside)
You're talking to strangers and walking on razors
You block out the entrance (from the inside)
You're calling on danger
Your touch growing stranger
You block out the entrance (from the inside)
You're talking to strangers (from the inside)
You're talking to strangers and walking on razors
You block out the entrance (from the inside)
You're calling on danger My little martyr my savior
You block out the entrance from the inside
