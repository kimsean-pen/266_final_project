I'm filled with fresh blood
I shoot like John Wayne
I scream like Kurt Cobain

I walk like Kate Moss
Disco like Diana Ross

I believe in you
I believe in me too
A new lease on life
We can get it, get it, get it yeah
Hands on the wheel
I'm feeling alive

Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm filled with fresh blood
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm filled with fresh blood
Sexual as Marvin Gaye
A fool like Kanye

Pop as Madonna
Royal as Diana

A hungry wolf
In the empty streets
On the hunt
While the city sleeps
Not about to let the moment pass
I'm going for the kill
Sink my teeth in
I'm feeling alive

I'm clutch like M.J
I rock like Presley
