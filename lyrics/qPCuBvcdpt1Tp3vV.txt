Everything that I say won't mean anything less
When I'm down in a grave
And you've put me to rest
Everything that I say won't mean anything less
When I'm down in a grave
And you've put me to rest
Go!

Will the story end
Will it ever change
I never knew a person could be so deranged
Does it make you feel good
Do you feel strong ruining the lives of everyone you love

As if life isn't hard already
Add it to the list of things to forget
With one chance to define ourselves
We're gonna keep on living
Keep on living

This is for the kids with the beaten in lips
Whose parents try to shut them up using their fists
Keep living loud and proud
They never can hold you down

This is for the kids with a soul like mine
When people tell you living is a waste of your time
Keep living loud and proud
They never can hold you down

Pull the plug with a single decision
Your way of life is a contradiction
Go to rehab celebrate with ketamine
Mend the wounds and light it with kerosene

Light my wounds with kerosene

Light my wounds with kerosene
Light my wounds with kerosene
Light my wounds with kerosene
As if life isn't hard already
Add it to the list of things to forget

With one chance to define ourselves
We're gonna keep on living
Keep on living

This is for the kids with the beaten in lips
Whose parents try to shut them up using their fists
Keep living loud and proud
They never can hold you down
This is for the kids with a soul like mine

When people tell you living is a waste of your time
Keep living loud and proud

They never can hold you down

Listen to the sound of your children revolting
Listen to the sound of the lives you're ruining

This is for the kids with the beaten in lips

Whose parents try to shut them up using their fists
Keep living loud and proud
They never can hold you down

This is for the kids with the beaten in lips
Whose parents try to shut them up using their fists
Keep living loud and proud
They never can hold you down
This is for the kids with a soul like mine
When people tell you living is a waste of your time
Keep living loud and proud
They never can hold you down
Everything that I say won't mean anything less
When I'm down in a grave
And you've put me to rest
Everything that I say won't mean anything less
When I'm down in a grave
And you've put me to rest
