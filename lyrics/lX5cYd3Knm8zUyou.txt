Is that the stars in the sky, or is it
Rain fallin' down
Will it burn me if I touch the sun
So big, so round

Would I be truthful, yeah, in,
Choosing' you as the one for me?
Is this love baby,
or is it just confusion?

My mind is so messed up
Goin' round and round
Must there be all the colours
Without names, without sound, baby?
My heart burns with feeling, but,
My mind, it's cold and reeling
Is this love baby,
or is it confusion?

My head is poundin', poundin'
Goin' 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
Must there always be these colours?
Without names, without sounds
My heart burns with feeling, but,
My mind, it's cold and reeling
Is this love baby,
or is it just confusion?
You tell me baby, is this
Love or confusion?

Mama, we must get together and find out
exactly what we're tryin' to do

Love or confusion?
Confusion
