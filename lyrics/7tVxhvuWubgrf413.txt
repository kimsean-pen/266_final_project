I could be discontent and chase the rainbows end
I might win much more but lose all that is mine
I could be a lot but I know I'm not
I'm content just with the riches that you bring

I might shoot to win and commit the sin
Of wanting more than I've already got
I could runaway but I'd rather stay
In the warmth of your smile lighting up my day, the one that makes me say

You're the best thing that ever happened to me or my world
You're the best thing that ever happened, so don't go away

I might be a king and steal my peoples things
But I don't go for that power crazy way
All that I could rule I don't check for fools
All that I need is to be left to live my way, listen what I say

You're the best thing that ever happened to me or my world
You're the best thing that ever happened, so don't go away

Your love is all I need, baby, you're the best for me
Come and rock my dreams but take the chance for me
Your love is all I need, baby, you're the best for me
Come and rock my dreams but take the chance for me

You're the best thing that ever happened to me or my world
You're the best thing that ever happened, so don't go away

You're the best thing that ever happened to me or my world
You're the best thing that ever happened, so don't go
Don't go, don't you go away
