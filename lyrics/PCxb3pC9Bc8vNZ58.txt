You won't heat up like I said you would
You won't heat up like I said you would

I know you follow around all the pretty girls
Saw you lay on the ground like the win was her's
I know you said, "come to bed"
I'd rather drink them alone
And watch the college instead & pray they reach for the phone

But God knows they won't call

You won't grow up like I said you would

I know they left it out for a later day
You stood on my back but got called away
The river's warmer while you're swimming
And in the seat of your car the sweat will drip from your pores
From all the things that you bought that she just turns & ignores
Cologne will cover my buzz I thought as I tried to prove
I'm not the father he was
I'm not the father he was

But I look so much like him
