Tired eyes echo tired lives
we've worked ourselves to the bone each night,
just to keep ourselves
crawling back inside.
Fingernails are broken down,
our limbs are torn out,
hearts are crowned
with the sorrow of a decade of decay.

Our waxen wings have let us down again,
like Icarus we flew into the sun.
The pride in our eyes
was our only disguise,
and now we lie here
broken and alone.
