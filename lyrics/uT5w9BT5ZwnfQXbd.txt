6 hours before
with an evil grin
better brace yourself
straightaway or win
Call power slide
Separates them all
Never touchin the brake
...Unapproachable...
(chorus)
Evil eye has set his plan
...Erasin' all...
Evil eye has set his plan
...Erasin' all...

Pushed through the floor
Halfway through the turn
As we ride up high
The dirt starts to burn
Wheels of his heap
Hits the backstreet wall
Evil eye has signaled
.Unapproachable...

Evil eye has set his plan
...Erasin' all...
Evil eye has set his plan
...Erasin' all...

Evil... eye... will fall
