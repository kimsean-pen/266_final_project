I've had enough of danger
People on the streets
I'm looking out for angels
Just trying to find some peace
I think it's time
That you let me know...
So if you love me say you love me
But if you don't just let me go...

'Cause teacher
There are things
That I don't want to learn
And the last one I had made me cry
So I don't want to learn to hold you touch you...
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy

Whose teacher has told him goodbye goodbye goodbye

When you were just a stranger and I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes telling me no...
So you think that you love me
Know that you need me
I wrote the song
I know it's wrong
Just let me go...
And teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
Oh the last one I had made me cry
So I don't want to learn to hold you touch you...
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy

Whose teacher has told him goodbye goodbye goodbye

So when you say that you need me

That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong you're not that strong let me go
And teacher
There are things
That I still have to learn
But the one thing I have is my pride
Oh
So I don't want to learn to hold you touch you...
Think that you're mine
Because there ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Who just isn't willing to try
I'm so cold inside
Maybe just one more try...
