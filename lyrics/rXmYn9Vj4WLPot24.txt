There's something in the water, calling my name
Two beats, I had no idea now the message you sent
Well, it ain't clear cause I fall, I'm in love
Now I'm holding on to my past
And my mother said "you're growing up fast" though
Time is gone in a blink
It's time to think and put your worries aside
Today is just a day and tomorrow never dies
So, never not live another regret and take every moment you get
And let actions speak louder than words
So shout at the skies if your words cannot be heard

Oh, there's something in the water, calling my name
Two beats, I had no idea now the message you sent
Well, it ain't clear cause, I fall, I'm in love
Yes, I fall, I'm in love again
With you, with you, with you, with you, now with you

Now I'm wondering why my force ain't clear
Am I hiding behind a crystal tear
And will the time stop or will the fine drop
And will my footprint make the mark
Well, I can see the light now, as I'm stepping out the door

Well there's something in the water, calling my name
Two beats, I had no idea well now the message you sent
Well it ain't clear cause I fall, I'm in love

There's something in the water
Water, water, water
Two beats I had no idea, now the message you sent
Well it ain't clear cause I fall, I'm in love
Yes, I fall, I'm in love again, now with you, with you, with you
With you, with you now, with you.
