I had a name, but they took it from me
I was the man that I wanted to be
I had a place to lay my head
But they burned it to the ground, and the sky turned red
I had a life and a place in the world
I had a sweet-talking wife and a beautiful girl
I know I'm never gonna see 'em again
Gonna tear the world up till I have my revenge
They took my life but it isn't the end
Oh, they put me in the ground but I'm back from the dead

Oh I'm a world ender baby and I'm comin' for them
Oh they put my in the ground, but I'm back from the dead
Oh I'm a world ender baby and I'm comin' for them
Oh they put my in the ground, but I'm back from the dead
You hear me howl by the light of the moon

That's how you know that I'm comin' for you
Gonna find you alone in the dark of night
Oh when the world ender comes, baby, run for your life
I never bleed and I won't ever age
I'll never feel the embrace of the grave
Oh the fair and the brave and the good must die
I've seen the other side of livin' I know heaven's a lie
I tear through the night and I raise some hell
'Cause I'm a world ender baby and I'm back from the dead

Lord knows I should be pushin' daisies
I was six feet down until somethin' raised me up
Sent back before I lift my curse
I'm gonna get me a taste of some chaos first
Untied, gonna get a little wild
Screamin' through the night like a demon child
Close your eyes now the light is fading
And the noise in the night is gonna get a little louder, baby

Oh I'm a world ender baby and I'm back from the grave
They can run for their lives, but they cannot be saved
I'm a world ender baby and I'm comin' for them
Oh they put my in the ground, but I'm back from the dead
Oh I'm a world ender baby and I'm back from the grave
They can run for their lives, but they cannot be saved
I'm a world ender baby and I'm comin' for them
Oh they put my in the ground, but I'm back from the dead
Oh I'm a world ender baby and I'm back from the grave
They can run for their lives, but they cannot be saved
I'm a world ender baby and I'm comin' for them
Oh they put my in the ground, but I'm back from the dead
