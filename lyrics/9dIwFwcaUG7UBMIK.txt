Green eyes, I'd run away with you
Green eyes, 'cause I'm a fool
I try running away

I'm just not fast enough
I'm just not fast enough

My, my own friends
Hate my guts
So what? Who gives a fuck?

Green eyes, I'd run away with you
Green eyes, 'cause I'm a fool
I try staying awake

I'm just not man enough
I'm just not man enough

My, my own friends
Hate me
But I don't give a shit
Sky high
Will I fly high? Maybe
Soar high, soar right through it

Green eyes, I'd run away with you
Green eyes, 'cause I'm a fool
I try running away

I'm just not fast enough
I'm just not man enough

I would try and understand
I would try and understand
That I'm to blame
'Cause I'm so lame

I'm just not man enough
I'm just not man enough

My, my own friends
Hate me
But I don't give a shit
Fly high
Will I fly high? Maybe
Soar high, soar right through it
