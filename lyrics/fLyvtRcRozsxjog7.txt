Way down
Way down, are you comin' with me

I look at you, look at me like you wanna go
We're gonna leave soon, you can come with us though
So aren't ya intrigued and a little bit curious
Brand new and a little bit dangerous
If you want some, here's your invitation

Take a chance, come along

You know you can
Come with us, with us, with us
You know you can
Come with us, with us, with us
You know you can

Way down, are you comin' with me
Way down, are you comin' with me

Sure you got other things you're supposed to do
Water your plants, go to work, plan a barbecue
Oh but I got an idea, why don't we all just leave here together
'Cause I wanna see ya, let your hair down, come on

'Cause you know you can
Come with us, with us, with us
You know you can
Come with us, with us, with us
You know you can

Way down, are you comin' with me
Way down, are you comin' with me
Way down, are you comin' with me
Way down, are you comin' with me
You know you can

Oo, it's time to move
You know we can dance all night, all day
I'm on the move, always
Honey, we can dance all night, all day
I'm on the move, always

Come dance with us, dance with us
Come dance with us, dance with us
You know you can
Come with us, with us, with us
You know you can
Come with us, with us, with us
You know you can
Way down, are you comin' with me
Way down, are you comin' with me
You know you can
Way down, are you comin' with me
Way down, are you comin' with me
You know you can
