Before us the King
As lifeless hearts sink

Before us lays dreams
A light no one sees

Hail to nothingness
You wish to die

Hail to Godliness
You wish to die

Ungodliest ones
The circle is done
Ungodliest ones

Hail to nothingness
You wish to die

Hail to Godliness
You wish to die

Before us the King
Our lifeless hearts sink

Before us beneath
A light no one sees
