Roots, bloody roots
Roots, bloody roots
Roots, bloody roots
Roots, bloody roooaaaaaahh!

I believe in our fate
We don't need to fake
It's all we wanna be
Watch me freak!

I say, we're growing every day
Getting stronger in every way
I'll take you to a place
Where we shall find our

Roots, bloody roots
Roots, bloody roots

Rain, bring me the strength
To get to another day
And all I want to see
Set us free

Why?
Can't you see?
Can't you feel?
This is real, aaah!

I pray, we don't need to change
Our ways to be saved
That all we wanna be
Watch us freak
