I loved the sound of when you came home
Oh, I was always on the side

But when you run me down and you run my mind
Why'd you treat me like that?
When you talk to me, it's always on your time
And I don't really need that

I thought that you were family
You're not speakin' to me, ooh
Make somethin' out of nothin'
Everyone above me, ooh

I thought that you were family
You're not speakin' to me
I put it on the line for you
Made somethin' out of nothin'
Everyone above me
Put it on the line for you

When you run me down and you run my mind
Why'd you treat me like that?
Just a matter of time before you're up my mind
And I don't really need that

I used to feel the embers burnin'
Now I'm the queen of apathy

When you run me down and you run my mind
Why'd you treat me like that?
When you talk to me it's always on your time
And I don't really need that

I thought that you were family
You're not speakin' to me
I put it on the line for you
Made somethin' out of nothin'
Everyone above me
Put it on the line for you

When you run me down and you run my mind
Why'd you treat me like that?
Just a matter of time before you're up my mind
'Cause I don't really need that

Tell me if I'm runnin' away
Tell me if my secrets are safe
Tell me if you want me to stay

I thought that you were family
You're not speakin' to me
I put it on the line for you
Made somethin' out of nothin'
Everyone above me
Put it on the line for you

When you run me down and you run my mind
Why'd you treat me like that?
Just a matter of time before you're up my mind
'Cause I don't really need that
I don't really need that
