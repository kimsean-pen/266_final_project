i can't feel my right side ear but i'll probably still not listen to jazz
i can't feel my left side hand god i hope it comes back to me again

but all this means is i'll get back what i lost
when i wanted to die
8 months before
or a year or two ago
sitting in my room with the light beams shining through
and an able bodied soul but a mind that didn't know
that light beam was gold
