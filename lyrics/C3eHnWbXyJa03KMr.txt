The water breaks the golden sunrays
Silver dances on the waves
But a memory...
I often dream about the old days
Playing hide and seek within the caves
But a memory...

I still feel the rising tides embrace me
Carrying me to a place unknown
But a memory...
I remember all the love they gave me
In this fluid world we call our home
But a memory...

Beneath the waves we were invincible
In a world without frontiers
World without walls
Beneath the waves we were inseparable
In a world without walls

Faces of cerulean oceans
Mirroring stars and sable skies
But a memory...
How I miss the scent of sweet emotions
Of a world so pure, devoid of cries
But a memory...

Beneath the waves we were unbeatable
In the silence of the sea
In a world without frontiers
World without walls
Beneath the waves we were untouchable
In the kingdom of the free
In a world without walls

Beneath the waves we were invincible
In the silence of the sea
In a world without frontiers
World without walls
Beneath the waves we were inseparable
In a kingdom of the free
In a world without walls

Face the facts, there is no way back
Arise! It's time to act
Face the facts, our future is black
Arise, we're on the wrong track

Water breaks the golden sunrays
Silver dances on the waves
But a memory...
I often dream about the old days
Playing hide and seek within the caves
But a memory...

Beneath the waves we were unbeatable
In the silence of the sea
In a world without frontiers
World without walls
Beneath the waves we were untouchable
In a kingdom of the free
In a world without walls
World without walls
Beneath the waves we were invincible
In the silence of the sea
In a world without frontiers
Beneath the waves we were inseparable
In our kingdom of the free
In a world without walls
