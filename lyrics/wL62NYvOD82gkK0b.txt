Never took a scene check
Never were a reject
Always lookin perfect
But now you aren't in step

Never took a scene check
Never were a reject
Always lookin perfect
Now you aren't so in step

You had your photograph in a magazine
Such a pretty boy and only nineteen
But now your 23 and it's all gone now
You ain't all that you wanna be somehow

Maybe it was only a dream
You just thought you could be
Anything that you want to be
Sadly, it all went wrong so

Never took a scene check
Never were a reject
Always lookin perfect
But now you aren't in step

Never took a scene check
Never were a reject
Always lookin perfect
Now you aren't so in step

Still just go to the same old clubs
But the new kids have got one above
Your music taste changed like the wind
You're doin now what's already been

And you still think that you're so it
'Cause you know so and so, and you made a hit
But we can't hear it being played
'Cause you my friend have had your day, so

Never took a scene check
Never were a reject
Always lookin perfect
But now you aren't in step

Never took a scene check
Never were a reject
Always lookin perfect
Now you aren't so in step

Never took a scene check
Now you aren't so in step
Now you aren't so...

Never took a scene check
Never were a reject
Always lookin perfect
But now you aren't in step

Never took a scene check
Never were a reject
Always lookin perfect
Now you aren't so in step

Never took a scene check
Never were a reject
Always lookin perfect
But now you aren't in step

Never took a scene check
Never were a reject
Always lookin perfect
Now you aren't so in step
