We have got to come together
how long can we stay apart?
you may get it maybe never
but it's coming from the heart.
Your life is full of indecision
you can't make up your mind.
we must get it in position
and move it on down the line.
'cause the road is long, it's a long hard climb
i been on that road too long of a time
yes the road is long, and it winds and winds
when i think of the love that i left behind.
Make me up a bed of roses
and hang them down from the vine
of all my loves you've been the closest
that's ever been on my mind.
Please don't talk about tomorrow
i'm really not one to care
this world is filled with too much sorrow
that nobody's heart should bear.
'cause the road is long, it's a long hard climb
i been on that road too long of a time
yes the road is long, and it winds and winds
when i think of the love that i left behind.
Please, please give me indication
stop and talk to me
like a river that is flowing
my love will never cease to be.
You will always be my honey
no one could take your part
our love can't be bought with money
'cause it's coming from the heart.
'cause the road is long, it's a long hard climb
i been on that road too long of a time
yes the road is long, and it winds and winds
when i think of the love that i left behind.
