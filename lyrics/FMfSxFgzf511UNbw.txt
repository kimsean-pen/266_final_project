Heaven is a truck
It got stuck on the breeze
Ask the driver nicely
I need a lift, I need release
The sand in the boats
On the rose-covered floats

She is the queen of a cancelled Pasadena thrill

I know arks can't fly
I know the sharks, they don't have wings
But lady, you need some cold advice
About a few things
Loosen my dress
Tie me up just like all the rest

She is the queen of a cancelled Pasadena thril
She is the queen of a cancelled Pasadena thrill (California)
She is the queen of a cancelled Pasadena thrill (California)
