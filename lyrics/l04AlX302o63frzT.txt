Bitches better off leavin' their mans at the hotel waitin'
Players drinkin', posted up flingin' out bands
That's for them hoes be naked
Poppin' pussy, pullin' it, shakin' it
Smokin' hot, boilin' pot
She got that chocha, that cobra, that clutch-em-up
I make 'em wide, I make 'em holler
Blow these niggas away now
Won't fuck a nigga twice
Smokin' ices, rollin' dice
Rice and peas on my hips and thighs
Python g-string hypnotized
Motorboat, motorbike
You should be lucky I even acknowledge you
You should be lucky I shot you that alley-oop
You was just cruisin' the streets, nigga

Pretty A.B., them bitches can't do it like me, no way
American dream, pussy be peppermint clean, okay
You sweatin' that steez, I'm hot like a hundred degrees, okay
Pretty A.B., bitches can't do it like me
Pretty A.B., them bitches can't do it like me, no way
American dream, pussy be peppermint clean, okay
You sweatin' that steez, I'm hot like a hundred degrees, okay
Pretty A.B., y'all bitches can't do it like this

Costa bottles, that bougie bae
That diva donna, that...
Chocolate bombshell, honey glazed
She bustin' out of her bustier
Rich niggas, what up?
Burn them fuckin' hundreds
Christian [?] from their pockets
Trips to the tropics, I want it
I let him spend this paper, but I never lick his lolli
He eat my pussy out and sing to me like Champagne Papi
La-di-da-di, now who gon' fuckin' stop me?
I'm chasin' the buck, I'm pretty
That's why niggas got to watch me
Woke up in the projects, ended up in Tijuana
I had to fill my pockets, had to holla at my gualas
Dollars, commas, get it, the whole enchilada
Diamond, pesos, papi, comprende, nigga?
Papi
Shout out to my aquis and all my freaky hotties
Bitches gettin' money, smokin' like Selassi
Let me rub them hundreds all over your body
Mami

Pretty A.B., bitches can't do it like me
Y'all bitches can't do it like me
Pretty A.B., bitches can't do it like me
Y'all bitches can't do it like this
Pretty A.B., bitches can't do it like uh
Y'all bitches can't do it like this
