Maranatha! Music(Maranatha Music)

Don't you be in such a hurry
Cause it only leads to worry
There's a time to work
But there's a time to pray
Try to find a quiet place
To hear His voice and seek His face
Can you hear the Spirit calling, Come away.

Come away, come away
Come and spend some time with Me,
Come away
Let your heart and mind be stilled
Let your empty cup be filled
Come and spend some time with Me,
Come away.

Are you sinking in your sorrow?
Are you worried about tomorrow?
Are the pressures of this life too hard to bear
If you cast your cares on Him
He'll give a perfect peace within
Can you hear the Spirit calling, Come away.

Hear Him say, Come away
Come and spend some time with Me
And my love will set You free
Come and spend some time with Me,
Come away.
