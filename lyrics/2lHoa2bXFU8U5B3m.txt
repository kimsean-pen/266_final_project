Every other question you'll never find the answer to
They can hear us but we will never see them

Do you feel safe?
Do you even understand me?
Do you even understand me?

We make no difference when numbers count for nothing
We make no difference if choices have been made
When your path has already been walked
When your hourglass is fooling you

What can you rely on?
Time is our only friend, now

Will we be, will we be...

If my life was to end today, It wouldn't change the world in any way

This sudden realisation is tearing me apart
This life is so perfect
What can be said of the end?
What will happen when our time comes
Who will stand the final test of time?

Every other question, you'll never find the answer to
They can hear us but we will never see them

If my life was to end today, It wouldn't change the world in any way

This life is so perfect
What can be said of the end
Will we be resurrected?
Who will stand the final test?
