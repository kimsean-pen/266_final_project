I said hello to warm you up.
But you have to go.
What is the lie sinking deeper.
In our own time.
You late to find.
Rolled me up.
And called it my mind.
Cowardly lies tie me up.
Oh in your own time.(see right through me) I got something in my mind.
Our quicksands running out of time.
You've been living it up, living it up.
She's wants you on the phone.
But you wont be coming home.
Some I'm giving it up, giving it up.
You, see right through me.Loving my weakness I've got problems.
You're but the same.
Telling my name overnight.
See I don't refrain.
3 in the morning.
Kitchen table.
Hard in my shame.
You look at me with your lips.
Ohhh you want the same.
I got something on my mind.
Our quicksands running out of time.
You've been living it up, living it up.
She's wants you on the phone.
But you wont be coming home.
Some I'm giving it up, giving it up.You, see right through me.Hoping I'm helping you.
Will help me, help me through.You, see right through me.
You're living it up, living it uppp.
