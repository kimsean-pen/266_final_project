Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright

Whoever thought the sun would come crashing down
My life in flames, my tears concrete the pain
We feel the end, the darkest, deepest riverbed
My book of life ain't complete without you here

Alone I sit and reminisce, sometimes
I miss your touch, your kiss, your smile
And meanwhile you know I never cry
'Cuz deep down inside
You know our love will never ever die

Everything's gonna be alright
(Yeah)
Everything's gonna be okay
(No doubt)
Everything's gonna be alright
(Together we can take this one day at a time)

Can you take my breath away?
(Yeah)
Can you give him life today?
(No doubt)
Is everything gonna be okay?
(I'll be your strength, I'll be here when you wake up)
(Take your time, and I'll be here when you wake up)

I never thought my heart would miss a single beat
Caress your hands, as I watch you while you sleep
So sweet, I weep as I search within
To find a cure, to bring you back again

And the sun will rise, open up your eyes
Surprise, just a blink of an eye
I try, I try to be positive
You're a fighter, so fight, wake up and live

Everything's gonna be alright
(Yeah)
Everything's gonna be okay
(No doubt)
Everything's gonna be alright
(Together we can take this one day at a time)

Can you take my breath away?
(Yeah)
Can you give him life today?
(No doubt)
Is everything gonna be okay?
(I'll be your strength, I'll be here when you wake up)
Everything's gonna be alright

I'd give my life to only see you breathe again
Hand in hand as we walk on the white sands
To hear your voice, rejoice as you rise and say
"This is the day that I wake, and pray, okay?"

Tears in silence, as time just moves on
You can't hear it though, but I'm playin' my favorite songs
I miss you much, I wish you'd come back to me
You see I'd wait a lifetime, 'cuz you're my destiny

Everything's gonna be alright
(Yeah)
Everything's gonna be okay
(No doubt)
Everything's gonna be alright
(Together we can take this one day at a time)

Can you take my breath away?
(Yeah)
Can you give him life today?
(No doubt)
Is everything gonna be okay?
(I'll be your strength, I'll be here when you wake up, alright)

Everything's gonna be alright
(Yeah)
Everything's gonna be okay
(No doubt)
Everything's gonna be alright
(Together we can take this one day at a time)

Can you take my breath away?
(Yeah)
Can you give him life today?
(No doubt)
Is everything gonna be okay?
(I'll be your strength, I'll be here when you wake up, alright)

Everything's gonna be alright
(No doubt)
Everything's gonna be alright
