On a road, forever
You will be riding to me
Metal death, cliffs exploding
Sirens mourn to me

Nightmares come and they don't go
For my love is gone
And I will never forgive the angels for that
And I will never forgive the angels for that

On a road, forever
You will be riding to me
Devil hearts explode
Beside me

Nightmares come and they won't go
For my love is gone
And I will never forgive the angels for that
And I will never forgive the angels for that
