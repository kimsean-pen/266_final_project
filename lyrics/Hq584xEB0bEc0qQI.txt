The plan of invasion
An Evil deception
Was made in the halls of the dark kingdom
To steal their riches
To slave them all
To make them kneel for a new God
The Guard woke up the sleeping men
With the sound of a bronze horn

The enemy is getting closer
So brace yourselves for assault!
Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land

Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might
Arrows are raining from the sky
As brothers fight side by side

We're outnumbered
But our destiny is to win
FIGHT!
Fight with the rage of a bear!

DEFEND!
Our homeland!
CRUSH!
Crush every enemy!

AND SEAL!
Our victory!
Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might

Ei urhot kaukaisen Pohjolan
Uhan eessä taipuneet
Jälleen pauhaa kansi taivahan
Veri valuu maahan lumiseen
Moni nähdä ei saa huomista
Moni jää heitä kaipaamaan
Jälkipolville jää maa rauhaisa
Voitonlaulut soi ainiaan

Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might
Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might
