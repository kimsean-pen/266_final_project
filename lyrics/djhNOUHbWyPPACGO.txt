there's a way to drive, i see it once in a while
i watch the tail-lights and memorize
i won't be too scared, i won't be too tired
i'm becoming hard-wired
feeling hazy, waking up inertia
i'm having dreams i'm in the wrong picture
am i older than you thought
did you get less than you bought

dan you wanna roast it dan
we're gonna kick it in the head if we can
me i'm just, me i'm just, i never got to read the plan
dan you wanna roast it dan
you know i never know the right way around
i need a map to get us out of this town

now your hand is flashing danger
i'm underdressed and you're getting stranger
i can't tell you i'm incomplete
you're gonna step on me
