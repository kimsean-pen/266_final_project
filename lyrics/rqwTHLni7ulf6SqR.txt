There's a good kind of pain and insane kinda sane
When I'm around you, when I'm around you
There's a chill in the heat, feel the sky at my feet
'Cause I adore you, I cant ignore you, yeah

I'm not ill, I don't need to
Take a pill to fix what you do
Cure can come through
'Cause baby all I do is suffer from the symptoms of you

There is a left kinda right, there is a blind kinda sight
Looking at you, looking at you
And there is no light in the moon and its winter in June
When I'm without you, when I'm without you, yeah

I'm not ill I don't need to
Take a pill to fix what you do
Cure can come through
'Cause baby all I do is suffer from the symptoms of you

And it trips me off my feet
I think I'm falling in too deep
Do you feel it too?

I'm not ill, I don't need to
Take a pill to fix what you do
Cure can come through
'Cause baby all I do is suffer from the symptoms of you

I'm not ill and I don't need to
Take a pill to fix what you do
Cure can come through
'Cause baby all I do is suffer from the symptoms of you
