Living in my memory
Faint footsteps call
It seems
Where the shadows wait
And the red tears seep
From the holes in the wall
From the holes in the wall
Our distant youth
Like flowers bloom
State laughter
For all of you
But, the petals fall
The petals fall

Though now the storm has passed
I lie beneath this cold grey earth
But, my screams are silent
Only silent
Take it away
Take it away, take it away

Living in my memory
Faint footsteps call
It seems
Where the shadows wait
and the red tears seep
From the holes in the wall
From the holes in the wall

Those footsteps
I do hear
And in anguish wait
For release
A hand to take
From this cold grey earth
Take it away
Take it away, take it away, take it away.
