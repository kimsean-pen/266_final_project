Cease to resist giving my goodbyes
I want to write you, I want to write you when i'm gone
And when I'm gone please don't mourn me, cause I'll be crying for my parents more then I could for you

Cause in your face, I see our place
Warm and cozy, hold me
Honey, honey

Casually, how are things?
Better than i'd hoped they'd be I wouldn't dare tell the truth

I have dreams in our place
A boy of three calls for his mom I say she's in the living room

You pick him up, hush baby
Mommy and daddy love you very much
These words resonate for days

Cause in your face, I see our place
Warm and cozy, hold me
Honey, honey

When you call through the screen I pretend like I'm in that dream
I forget that you're miles away
