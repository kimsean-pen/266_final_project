I'm in the right direction
I mean to ride this ocean
Travelling in slow motion
Padding with no question

Early morning with the sun
Not yet burning, innocent
I try to be a good son
Myself one hundred per cent

Ooh, ooh

I feel it inside
I wanna reach that
It's somewhere in sight
I wish I'd reach that
Skyline
Skyline
I wanna reach that
Skyline
Skyline
I wish I'd reach that
Skyline
Skyline
I'm gonna reach that
Skyline
Skyline

Endless troubles to go through
They are strewn in the city
Daily struggle to be true
Betrayed authenticity

Poison world around but still
I will take another round
Or another ride until
We take off from the ground

I feel it inside
I wanna reach that
It's somewhere in sight
I wish I'd reach that
Reach that
Skyline
Skyline
I wanna reach that
Skyline
Skyline
I wish I'd reach that
Skyline
Skyline
I wanna reach that
Skyline
Skyline

Skyline inside
I see a skyline inside
I see a skyline inside
I see a skyline inside
I see a skyline inside
I see a skyline inside
I see a skyline inside
I see a skyline inside
