A note by the door
Simply explains
It's all that remains
It's no wonder why
I have not slept in days

The dust on the floor
Piled up from the years
All those scars and souvenirs

Now that you're gone
It's easy to see
But so hard to believe

By the way
You left without saying
Goodbye to me

Now that you're gone away
All I can think about is
You and me
You and me

It's not like before
You left nothing here
It's all disappeared

It hurts me to see
That we've been a lie

Would it have hurt you to try?
By the way
You left without saying
Goodbye to me
Now that you're gone away
All I can think about is
You and me
You and me
It's sad to say that
This pain is killing me inside
But it's time to say
That this pain is keeping me alive
Twisting and turning
It rips through my heart
It's been tearing me apart
By the way
You left without saying
Goodbye to me
Now that you're gone away
All I can think about is
You and me
You and me
(Meeeeeeeeee, yeeeeeeah)
All I think about now
Is you and me
You and me
(Meeeeeeeeee, yeeeeeeah)
All I think about now
Is you and me
You and me
(Yeeeeeeeee yeeeeah)
By the way
By the way
By the way
