Twenty-something
good as new
Expectations
got a few
Find an issue
get ahead
Got it sorted
like you said
You're twenty-something
Join the queue

Twenty-something
in the mix
Always that
ironic twist
Got a start-up
good to go
when the money
starts to flow
Oh, Twenty-something
up to tricks

That's how you are
or have to be
in a decadent city
at a time of greed
You can make believe
that it's all you need
Sometimes it's hard
day to day
to pay your way

Twenty-something
Quite a catch
Think you'll ever
meet your match?
You've always been somewhat choosy
but you'll love her for the length
of a good movie
Oh, Twenty-something
Call her back

That's how you are
or have to be in a decadent city
at a time of greed
You can make believe
that it's all you need
Take your smart phone
and make your way home
on your own

Twenty-something
Hard to beat
Check your reflection
walking down the street
Thirty's calling
round the bend
Will your ideas
ever trend?
Oh, Twenty-something
feel the heat

Find an issue
get ahead
Got it sorted
like you said
You're twenty-something
and so to bed

That's how you are
or have to be
in a decadent city
at a time of greed
You can make believe
that it's all you need
Sometimes it's hard
day to day
to pay your way
