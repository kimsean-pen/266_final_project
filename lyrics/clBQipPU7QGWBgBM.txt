hey green river what can i do?
if it's alright i'll walk next to you
sit in the shade of your beechwood trees
don't you know these days i ain't hard to please
sprinklers coming on
a shower in?
and the runoff feeds the flow of your muddy water
your many thousand?
your? for your hungry?
cause you know that we are all your sons and daughters
