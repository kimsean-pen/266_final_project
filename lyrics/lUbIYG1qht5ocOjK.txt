And we can run
From the backdrop of these gears and scalpels
At every hour
Goes the tick tock bang of moniters as
They stared us down
When we met in the emergency room
And in our beds
I could hear you breathe with help from cold machines

Every hour,
On the hour,
They drew blood

Well I felt I couldn't take
Another day inside this place
From silent dreams we never wake
And in this promise that we'll make
Starless eyes, for Heaven's sake
But I hear you anyway
Well I thought I heard you say I like you
We can get out
We don't have to stay
Stay inside this place

Someday, this day,
We kept falling down
One day, this day,
Set the ferris wheel ablaze
You left
My heart
And open wound
And I love you for
This day
Someday
We kept falling down
Someday, this day
All we had to keep us safe
And if
We never sleep again
It would never end
Well I thought I
Heard you say to me
We'll go, so far,
Far as we can
And I just can't stay
One day we'll run away
