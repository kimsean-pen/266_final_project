Rewind, I'm chasing time
Running inside my mind
I'm so addicted to you
Relapse, I'm drowning in
All of your fingerprints
I'm so addicted to you
I'm drawn to your flame
That's always ruined us
Ruined us
Heat me inside
I'm ready for that rush, for that rush
I'm drawn to your flame
That's always ruined us
Ruined us
Heat me inside
I'm ready for that rush, for that rush
Falling back to our heights
Filling in this divide
Crave me one last time
Pushing it all the time
Touching til we ignite
Work for this body high
Need you to take me, take me, take me
Or pull me in, let's feel so wrong
Get this body, get this body high
Falling back to our heights
Filling in this divide
Only you can get my body high
Reach out, I feel your tie
We're broken but alive
Intoxicated by you
Replay, watch me unwind
You always got me blind
Intoxicated by you
I'm drawn to your flame
That's always ruined us
Ruined us
Heat me inside
I'm ready for that rush, for that rush
Drawn to your flame
That's always ruined us
Ruined us
Heat me inside
I'm ready for that rush, for that rush
Falling back to our heights
Filling in this divide
Crave me one last time
Pushing it all the time
Touching til we ignite
Work for this body high
Need you to take me, take me, take me
Or pull me in, let's feel so wrong
Get this body, get this body high
Falling back to our heights
Filling in this divide
Only you can get my body high
I'm drawn to your flame
That's always ruined us
Ruined us
Heat me inside
I'm ready for that rush, for that rush
Falling back to our heights
Filling in this divide
Crave me one last time
Pushing it all the time
Touching til we ignite
Work for this body high
Need you to take me, take me, take me
Or pull me in, let's feel so wrong
Get this body, get this body high
Falling back to our heights
Filling in this divide
Only you can get my body high
