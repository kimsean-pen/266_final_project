We haven't been the same you know
Since we buried you below
On that still winter day
In the plot you picked out
So many years ago
When you laid your wife in her grave

Bring me back to autumn
Or lead me on to may
I'm not ready to take the helm
Abandoned on your dying day

Played them a reverie
And that's just fine with me
If the crows sit and caw
How deep the earth will freeze
And seal our every hum
Even after the thaw

Bring me back to autumn
Or lead me on to may
I'm not ready to take the helm
Abandoned on your dying day

If I can here return
If I can ever learn to
Fill the void as they say
Grateful I can have this earth to
Channel you in my hands
Feel your force in a way

And it will bring me back to autumn
Or lead me on to may
I'm not ready to take the helm
Abandoned on your dying day

And it will bring me back to autumn
Or lead me on to may
I'm not ready to take the helm
Abandoned on your dying day
Your dying day, your dying day
