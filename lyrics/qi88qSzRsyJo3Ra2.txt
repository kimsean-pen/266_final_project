Why don't we do it on your own?
Just to see if you still have it in you
And my heart is breaking
And my hands are shaking
And our lies were making perfect sense to me

But you're drunk, you think that you know it all
Just counting the scars on your fading heart
You let it get away

And my heart is breaking
And my hands are shaking
And our lies are making perfect sense to me

You're drunk you think that you know it all
Just counting the scars on your fading heart
You let it get away
