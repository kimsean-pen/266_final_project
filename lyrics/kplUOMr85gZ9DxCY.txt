Alibi, do you know that I've been thinking
'bout the means and the ways that you love him
and not me
and that's fine
Alibi, do you know that I have been sinking
The captain and I, we've been thinking
"Drown our boat?"
Should we drown our boat?
Let's get lost again
Let's get lost again
Alibi, do you know that I have been drinking
Bourbon, gin, and tonic I'm mixing, now I'm drunk
God, I'm drunk
Alibi, do you know that life has been stinking
Ever since the day that you left here
Now you're gone
Oh you're gone
Let's get lost again
Let's get lost again
Through our fires and our dessert
There are means in which desires
Are just meant to be a part
Of this lonely 'n' broken life
There are means in which desire means
Follow your truest love
Let's get lost again
Let's get lost again
