7: 45 on the Boulevard
Cruising top down 'til the sunset
I know we both feel it
We gone live it up, hit the J
Blow the ashes in the wind
Highway, we out of sight
Let's ride

Where do we go, oh I don't know where you've been
So why do we cry when we both know it's the end

Don't be cruel
'Cause I will never be that cruel to you
Just be cool
'Cause I will never be that cruel to you

I stop then you go
When I gave, then you broke
And you're tryna play it hard
You'll be looking for me
Hurry up, I'm about to leave
I got my ticket one way

So where do we go, oh I don't know where you been
So why do we cry when we both know it's the end

Don't be cruel
'Cause I will never be that cruel to you
Just be cool
'Cause I will never be that cruel to you
Don't be cruel
'Cause I will never be that cruel to you
Just be cool
'Cause I will never be that cruel to you

Don't be so cruel
Don't be
Don't be so cruel
Don't be

Don't be so cruel, baby blue
On my mind, hard to think
Don't be so cruel, don't be
I want you, baby, need your love
Got to have you in my world
Don't be so cruel, hey, don't be
I want you
I need you, need you
Don't be so cruel, don't be
I really need your love, you
Don't be so cruel, don't be
