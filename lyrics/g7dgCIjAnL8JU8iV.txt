Now i'm just a man with a perfect crime
Time and time again, perfect alibi
And life seems so different in my eyes
So now i scream for a life of eternity
And i'm just an unknown mystery
And i cannot hide all this misery
So now i scream
Life will make you
Bleed
It's down to who you wanna be
It's down to you
You wanna
Take another bite from insanity
Take another bite from reality
Bleed
Step up to who you wanna be
Step up to who you wanna
Take another bite from insanity
Take another bite from reality
Now fight for the meaning in your life
Crime isn't the answer for you now
And hide all the pieces in your life
Make up your mind
You can be who you wanna be
And find a way to peace and serenity
Slide to the ways of reality
So why do you scream
Life will make you
Bleed
It's down to who you wanna be
It's down to you, you wanna
Take another bite from insanity
Take another bite from reality
Bleed
Step up to who you wanna be
Step up to who you wanna
Take another bite from insanity
Take another bite from reality.
Scream, scream, scream,
Now you scream, so now you scream
So now you bleed
Bleed
It's down to who you wanna be
It's down to you, you wanna
Take another bite from insanity
Take another bite from reality
Bleed
Step up to who you wanna be
Step up to who you wanna
Take another bite from insanity
Take another bite from reality
Take another bite from reality
