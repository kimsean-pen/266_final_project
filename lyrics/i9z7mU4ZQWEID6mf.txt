While this town is busy sleeping
All the noise has died away
I walk the streets to stop my weeping
'Cause she'll never change her ways

But don't fool yourself
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
My heart feels so still
As I try to find the will
To forget her somehow

Oh I think I've forgotten her now
Her love is a rose pale and dying
Dropping her petals and man I know
All full of wine, the world before her, was sober with no place to go

Don't fool yourself
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
My heart is frozen still
As I try to find the will
To forget her somehow

She's somewhere out there now
Oh my tears falling down
As I tried to forget
Her love was a joke from the day that we met
All of the words all of her men all of my pain
When I think back to when Remember her hair as it shone in the sun
Smell of the bed when I knew what she'd done

Tell yourself over and over
You won't ever need her again
But don't fool yourself
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
Oh, my heart is frozen still

As I try to find the will
To forget her somehow
She's out there somewhere now
Oh, She was heartache from the day that I first met her
My heart is frozen still
As I try to find the will
To forget you somehow
'Cause I know you're somewhere out there right now
