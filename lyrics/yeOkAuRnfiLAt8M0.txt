Every time I look at you, I go blind
Every time I look at you, I go blind
Every time I look at you, I go blind
Every time I look at you, I go blind

In the mornin' I get up
And I try to feel alive, but I can't
Every time I look at you, I go blind
I don't know what it is
Something in me just won't give me a chance

I think it's that I feel more confused
By the deal love has shown me

Little child, did you know that there's a light
And it's gonna shine right through your eyes
What do you think that life is like?
Every time I look at you, I go blind, I go blind

Well, somewhere over there, there's a purpose
There's a care for free
In me there's nobody, no one plan
No one stand to be free

I think it's that because I have seen all the fuss
And it's no big deal, no big deal

Hold me, hold me
'Cause I want to get higher and higher
(Every time I look at you, I go blind)
Higher than

Hold me, hold me
'Cause I want to get higher and higher
(Every time I look at you, I go blind)
Higher than

Hold me, hold me
'Cause I want to get higher and higher
(Every time I look at you, I go blind)
Higher than

Hold me, hold me
'Cause I want to get higher and higher
(Every time I look at you, I go blind)
Higher than life
