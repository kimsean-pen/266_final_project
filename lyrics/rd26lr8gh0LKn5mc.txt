We live in the rain, a sea of change
You can't keep anything you take
The lovely face of lives we chase
Is but dust for wind to take
When all is gone, the only loss
To not have loved at every cost
When you can say, and I can say
We loved with every step we take, I'll be ok

How do you love when your heart is broken?
How do you speak when you feel outspoken?
I can forgive and be forgiven

By learning to heal with a heart wide open

With open hearts, despite the stakes
We take a chance on our mistakes
A brand new day, we will embrace
An open wound that heals with grace
All the fears that we will face
In this time, and in this place

When you can say, and I can say
We loved with every step we take, I'll be ok

How do you love when your heart is broken?
(How do you love when your heart is broken?)
How do you speak when you feel outspoken?
(How do you speak when you feel outspoken?)
I can forgive and be forgiven
(I can forgive and be forgiven)
By learning to heal with a heart wide open
I'll be ok
I'll be ok
We live in the rain, a sea of change
You can't keep anything you take
The lovely face of lives we chase
Is but dust for wind to take
When all is gone, the only loss
To not have loved at every cost
When you can say, and I can say
We loved with every step we take, I'll be ok
How do you love when your heart is broken?
(How do you love when your heart is broken?)
How do you speak when you feel outspoken?
(How do you speak when you feel outspoken?)
I can forgive and be forgiven
(I can forgive and be forgiven)
By learning to heal with a heart wide open
(How do you love when your heart is broken?)
I'll be ok
(How do you love when your heart is broken?)
I'll be ok
(How do you love when your heart is broken?)
I'll be ok
I'll be ok
I'll be ok, ok (How do you love when your heart is broken?)
I'll be ok
(How do you love when your heart is broken?)
We live in the rain
We live in the rain
We live in the rain
