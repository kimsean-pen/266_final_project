I wanna be everything for you all the time
But I'm just a human being
I'm just a human being

Step into this room where I like
To hide away
Any day now I will find my
Many worlds collide
Until then I know we have time
And I want you in my room tonight

Nothing's ever perfect
There's a shadow side
But I believe that it's worth it
Yeah, the trust will be justified

I wanna be everything for you all the time
But I'm just a human being
Everything for you all the time
But I'm just a human being
Yeah I wanna see
If it truly satisfies you
Now you know that I'm just a human being
I'm just a human being

Could it be that we are part of
Something supernatural
Where's the problem when there's someone
You come to rely on
I can see that you got that ache
So let the feeling overtake

We're just flesh and blood
But not for long

I wanna be everything for you all the time
But I'm just a human being
Everything for you all the time
But I'm just a human being
Yeah I wanna see
If it truly satisfies you
Now you know that I'm just a human being
I'm just a human being

I wanna be everything for you all the time
But I'm just a human being
Everything for you all the time
But I'm just a human
Aaaoh aaaoh
Oooooh

Yeah I wanna see
If it truly satisfies you
Now you know that I'm just a human being
I'm just a human being
