I'm gettin' sad alone
Dancing with myself
Greedy go-getter goal
the luxury of stealth

I'm seedy and the whole,
dancing with myself
I get into my bed
I do it to myself

To the local,
To the lo-o-o, I go out
To the local
By myself
To the local

I did it to my head
There's nothing to be addressed now
There's nothing to get up about
Cause we do it all the time
The shepherd is undone
She done it all again
I get ready to go
The greed go-getter con

He going to the local
He going to the local
O-ohh
He going to the local
He going to the local

To many western men
It's a problem left undone
Imperious the sign
The papers of luxury
A greedy go-getter in the skybox
She run alone
She get ready to go
She does it with herself

She does it with herself
She does it with herself
She does it on her own
She does it on her own
