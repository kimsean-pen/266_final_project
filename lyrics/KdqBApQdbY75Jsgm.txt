I've never cared for authority
I've never felt part of the majority
Well, I lost my home and I lost my wife
This is no joke, this is my life

New suit of clothes, same emperor,
Some people think, think that they're superior
But you can cut them down with a rusty knife
This is no joke, this is my life

I'm just one man, what can I do
Against an army, an army made of you
Time marches on to a drum and fife
This is no joke, this is my life
