Afraid to walk the streets in the coldness all alone
The blackness of the night engulfs your flesh and bones
Hoping for relief from the fear you feel inside
Losing all perspective of reality in the night

Running from shadows, blinded by fear
The horror of nightfall is ever so near
I slowly surround you as terror sets in
Are you afraid of the night?

I see the fright in your eyes as you turn and run
But is your mind playing tricks on a body so very young
Feeling as if no one cares, the fear runs down your spine
But I know I'll never rest until I know you're mine

Running from shadows, blinded by fear
The horror of nightfall is ever so near
I slowly surround you as terror sets in
Are you afraid of the night?

Afraid to walk the streets in the coldness all alone
The blackness of the night engulfs your flesh and bones
Feeling as if no one cares, the fear runs down your spine
But I know I'll never rest until I know you're mine

I know you're mine!
Too late to hide!
Too late to save your life!

Tormentor!
