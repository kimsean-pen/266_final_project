I walk through the night
and haunting voices echo through my head
Torturing me as I enter the hallways
of the ancient realm forlorn and cold

Rulers of the majestic night, I sacrifice myself
I summon the one with the horns and the fire
as I throw myself right into the dark

I open the doors to the other side,
where everything is so old
I'm leaving my body and enter the void
to where all shadows must return

Infernal beasts of Hell,
gather around my hungering heart
Burn my flesh as you cleanse my soul
I shall forever ream in obscurity

Eternally doomed
Forever to yearn
Eternally doomed
Forever to burn

Rulers of the majestic night, I sacrifice myself
I summon the one with the horns and the fire
as I throw myself right into the dark

I open the doors to the other side,
where everything is so old
I'm leaving this world and I enter the void
where the shadows forever reign

I walk through the dark
and haunting voices echo through my mind
Torturing me as I enter the hallways
of the ancient realm forlorn and cold

Rulers of the majestic night, I sacrifice myself
I summon the one with the horns and the fire
as I throw myself right into the dark

And through the night I must walk
As the opposer of the light
While the prepetual darkness
Prevails in my heart
