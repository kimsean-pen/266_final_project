I always find my dream girls
but it's only when I sleep
I've been staying in my dreams, positivity
Now I'm counting sheep on my bedroom walls, alright
Holly and Monique, I just love them all alright

(When I find my dream girls)
When I find my dream girls
(it's only in my sleep)
it's only in my sleep
(when I find my dream girls)
when I find my dream girls
(it's only in my sleep)
it's only in my sleep

Got to speak it fast, got to tell the truth
Play them all my tracks in my dream booth
Cindy takes my hand and she pulls me aside alright
Now she wants to dance, it's my favorite ride, alright

(When I find my dream girls)
When I find my dream girls
(it's only in my sleep)
it's only in my sleep
(when I find my dream girls)
when I find my dream girls
(it's only in my sleep)
it's only in my sleep

Stay in bed all day waiting for the night
when I close my eyes everythings alright

is that you dream girl
yes
does my dream girl love me too
yes
alright

(When I find my dream girls)
When I find my dream girls
(it's only in my sleep)
it's only in my sleep
(when I find my dream girls)
when I find my dream girls
(it's only in my sleep)
it's only in my sleep

Stay in bed all day waiting for the night
when I close my eyes everythings alright
I don't lose my cool I don't lose my mind
when I close my eyes everything is fine
