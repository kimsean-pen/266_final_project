How do rumors get started?
They're started by the jealous people and
They get mad about somethin they had, and sombody else is holdin

They tell me that temptation is very hard to resist
These wicked women, oohh they just persist
Maybe you think it's cute, but girl I'm not impressed
I tell you one time only with my business please don't mess

Look at all these rumors surrounding me everyday
I just need some time some time to get away from
From all these rumors I can't take it no more
My best friend said there's one out there about me
and the girl next door

Did you hear the one about Tina?
Some say she's much too loose
That came straight from a guy who claims he's tastin her juice

Did you hear the one about Michael?
Some say he must be gay
I tried to argue but they said if he were straight he wouldn't move that way

Did you hear the one about Susan?
Some say she's just a tease
In a camosal she's six feet tall she'll knock you to you knees.

Look at all these rumors surrounding me everyday
I just need some time some time to get away from
From all these rumors I can't take it no more

I can't go no place without somebody pointing a finger
I can't show my face cuz when it comes to rumors I'm a dead ringer

It seems from rumors I just can't get away
I bet there'll even be rumors floatin' around on Judgment Day

I'll think I'll write my congressman and tell him to pass a bill
For the next time they catch somebody startin' rumors, shoot to kill

Will you look at all these rumors surroundin' me every day
I just need some time, some time to get away from
From all these rumors, I can't take it no more
My best friend said there's one out now about me and the girl next door
