I'm standin' still without you
In the emptiest of fields
I wish that I could say what's on my mind

The straw that fills your heart
So you never have to feel
You say that you just need a little time

Days like these I bury my
My each and every word
And hide them underneath these lonely trees

The harvest moon is wicked
I know that you've been hurt
I swear I'm here for good I'll never leave

This is where it starts tonight
If you open up your heart tonight

You're staring out the window
And I'm out here in the street
You stand there like a scarecrow
And I'm begging you to speak
You used to be my solid ground
Now I'm drowning in the sea
And I just want to believe in you and me
I just want to believe in you and me

(Heeya! Heey! Heeya! Heey)

You used to be so full of life
Not just an empty shell
You're out there all alone I wonder why

The pieces keep on falling out
And I pick them up myself
But I'd let you steal the buttons from my eyes

Oh, this is where it starts tonight
If you open up your heart tonight

You're staring out the window
And I'm out here in the street
You stand there like a scarecrow
And I'm begging you to speak
You used to be my solid ground
Now I'm drowning in the sea
And I just want to believe in you and me
Yeah, I just want to believe in you and me

(Heeya! Heey! Heeya! Heey)
(Heeya! Heey! Heeya! Heey)

You said you'd open up for me
Well nothing's what it seems to be
How can I make you feel again
Only you can make me real again

You're staring out the window
And I'm out here in the street
You stand there like a scarecrow
And I'm begging you to speak
You used to be my solid ground
Now I'm drowning in the sea
I just want to believe in you and me
I just want to believe in you and me

You're staring out the window
I'm out here in the street
You stand there like a scarecrow
I'm begging you to speak
You used to be my solid ground
Now I'm drowning in the sea
And I just want to believe in you and me
Yeah, I just want to believe in you and me

(Heeya! Heey! Heeya! Heey)

You're staring out the window
I'm out here in the street
You stand there like a scarecrow
And I just want to believe in you and me
