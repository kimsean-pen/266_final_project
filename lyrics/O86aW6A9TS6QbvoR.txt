I'm breakin' down
Gonna start from scratch
Shake it off like an etch-a-sketch
My lips are saying goodbye
My eyes are finally dry

I'm not the way that I used to be
I took the record off repeat
It killed me but I survived
And now I'm coming alive

I'll never be that girl again
No oh oh
No oh oh

My innocence is wearin' thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me

Miss movin' on
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

I broke the glass surrounding me (surrounding me)
I ain't the way you remember me (remember me)
I was such a good girl
So fragile but no more

I jumped the fence to the other side (the other side)
My whole world was electrified (electrified)
Now I'm no longer afraid
It's Independence Day (Independence Day)

I'll never be that girl again
No oh oh
No oh oh

My innocence is wearin' thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me

Miss movin' on

Everything is changing and I never wanna go back to the way it was (to the way it was)
I'm finding who I am and who I am from here and now is gonna be enough (is gonna be enough)
Is gonna be enough

I'll never be that girl again
No oh oh
I'll never be that girl again
Oh oh oh

My innocence is wearin' thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me

Miss movin' on
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Yeah, I'm movin' on
