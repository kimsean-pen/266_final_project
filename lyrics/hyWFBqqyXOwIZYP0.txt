Soft kiss and whine
what a pretty friends of mine, we're finally intertwined
nervous and shy, for the moment we will come alive, tonight
secret valentine

We'll write a song that turns out the lights
When both boy & girl start, suddenly shaking inside
Don't waste your time, speed up your breathing
Just close your eyes
We'll hope it's not for nothing at all
lay down be still, don't worry talk they will
I'll be loving you until
morning's first light breaks tomorrow, i'll take care of you tonight
secret valentine
We'll write a song that turns out the lights
When both boy & girl start, suddenly shaking inside
Don't waste your time, speed up your breathing
Just close your eyes
We'll hope it's not for nothing at all
when guilt fills your hole head
brush off rise up from the dead, this is the moment that we
will come alive
brase yourself for love, sweet love, secret love
We'll write a song that turns out the lights
When both boy & girl start, suddenly shaking inside
Don't waste your time, speed up your breathing
Just close your eyes
We'll hope it's not for nothing at all
We'll write a song that turns out the lights
When both boy & girl start, suddenly shaking inside
Don't waste your time, speed up your breathing
Just close your eyes
We'll hope it's not for nothing at all
nothing at all
