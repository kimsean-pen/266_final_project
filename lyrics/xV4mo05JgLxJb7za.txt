There's always something left inside him
I've really nothing much to lose
It seems so sentimental
Why should I care?

Somewhere there's a sound of distant living
Locked up in high society
It seems so artificial
Why should I care?

Oh ho ho
Life can be cruel
Life in Tokyo
Oh ho ho
Life can be cruel
Life in Tokyo

Another vehicle heads for sunset
No other providence will do
They're only buildings and houses
Why should I care

Oh ho ho
Life can be cruel
Life in Tokyo
Oh ho ho
Life can be cruel
Life in Tokyo

Oh ho ho
Life can be cruel
Life in Tokyo
Oh ho ho
Life can be cruel
Life in Tokyo

Oh ho ho
Life can be cruel
Life in Tokyo...
