Dear mother
I love you
I'm sorry I wasn't good enough
Dear father
Forgive me
'Cause in your eyes I just never added up
In my heart I know I failed you
But you left me here alone

If I could hold back the rain
Would you numb the pain?
'Cause I remember everything
If I could help you forget
Would you take my regrets?
'Cause I remember everything

Dear brother
Just don't hate me
For never standing by you or being by your side
Dear sister
Please don't blame me
I only did what I thought was truly right
It's a long and lonely road
When you know you walk alone

If I could hold back the rain
Would you numb the pain?
'Cause I remember everything
If I could help you forget
Would you take my regrets?
'Cause I remember everything

I feel like running away
I'm still so far from home
You say that I'll never change
But what the fuck do you know?
I'll burn it all to the ground before I let you in
Please forgive me
I can't forgive you now
I remember everything

If I could hold back the rain
Would you numb the pain?
'Cause I remember everything
If I could help you forget
Would you take my regrets?
'Cause I remember everything

It all went by so fast
I still can't change the past
I always will remember everything
If we could start again
Would that have changed the end?
We remember everything
Everything
