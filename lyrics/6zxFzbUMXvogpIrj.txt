Dedication to the ruin of the light within you
Darkness all around
It's so easy to let go of all the things that make you true
Watch it all fall down

You bait me, I follow
And if this night feels hollow
Then drown me in sorrow
There will be no tomorrow

Some reflection of this place that felt so secret and warm
Did you hear me say?
Did you know that I would close the door and leave you in the storm
And you'd wash away?

You bait me, I follow
And if this night feels hollow
Then drown me in sorrow
There will be no tomorrow

You pretend that you want somebody
I'll pretend that I need someone

You pretend you could love somebody
Just know you're not the only one

You don't want somebody
I don't need someone
You can't love somebody
You're the only one
You bait me, I follow
And if this night feels hollow

Then drown me in sorrow
There will be no tomorrow
