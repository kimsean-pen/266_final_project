I'm cutting through, you're bleeding out
And I would tell the truth, but I can't help myself
Red rushes out, dissect this nerve
And I'll stop myself before I reach my cell

I wasn't asking for the world
And you know that I'm not one to follow through
All these city streets the people look the same
And I can see your face, and I can hear your name
I wasn't asking for the world

You're stabbing in. Permanent scars
And you'll justify it all inside yourself
You've finished me, my pulse is gone
And you're satisfied to put this all to hell

I wasn't asking for the world
And you know that I'm not one to follow through
All these city streets the people look the same
And I can see your face, and I can hear your name
I wasn't asking for the world

Drink the poison, when you think it's over
(Drink the poison)
Stabbing yourself, when you think it's too late
Tragic endings are your thing, you love them
(Tragic endings)
You love letting go, the ending's the same
Drink the poison, when you think it's over
(Drink the poison)
Inevitable, Verona lives inside of you

I wasn't asking for the world
And you know that I'm not one to follow through
All these city streets the people look the same
And I can see your face, and I can hear your name
I wasn't asking for the world
