Oh, Donna
My home is my man
Try as hard as you can
I ain't gonna leave him

No, c'mon!
My song is my land
and my body is my band
and I ain't stop it!

Sweet, sweet Donna
I'm no longer aged ten
So listen to my plan
If you go I'll come back

You know I want him all the time
You know I need him all the time
You know we keep dreaming all the time
You know we live it all the time
You know we do it
and I ain't gonna stop it!

Do it as i try, try it as i'm living, leaving home is
flying, staying alone is lying
all the days are life, and all the stars are light
so if the hearts are beating, everybody can be loved
everybody's feeling, everyone can do it
but none of them would try it, and it they do they'll love it too
all the days are life, and all the lovers light
so if the hearts are beating avaerybody can get love.
