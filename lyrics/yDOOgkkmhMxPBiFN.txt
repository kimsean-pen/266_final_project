Gonna keep on dancin' to the rock 'n' roll
On Saturday night, Saturday night
Dancin' to the rhythm in our heart and soul
On Saturday night, Saturday night

I-I-I-I-I just can't wait
I-I-I-I gotta date

At the good ol' rock 'n' roll road show
I've gotta go
Saturday night, Saturday night
Gonna rock it up, roll it up
Do it all, have a ball
Saturday night, Saturday night

On Saturday night, Saturday night
Tell her all the little things I'm gonna do
On Saturday night, Saturday night

I-I-I-I-I love her so
I-I-I-I'm gonna let her know

At the good ol' rock 'n' roll road show
I've gotta go
Saturday night, Saturday night
Gonna rock it up, roll it up
Do it all, have a ball
Saturday night, Saturday night
