A desert road from Vegas to nowhere
Some place better than where you've been
A coffee machine that needs some fixing
In a little café just around the bend
I am calling you
Can't you hear me
I am calling you
A hot dry wind blows right through me
Your baby's crying and I can't sleep
But we all know a change is coming
Coming closer, sweet release
I am calling you
I know you hear me
I am calling you
Oh, whoa, yeah. Oh
I am calling you
I am calling you
A desert road from Vegas to nowhere
Some place better than where you've been
A coffee machine that needs some fixing
In a little café just around the bend
A hot dry wind blows right through me
Your baby's crying; I can't sleep
Oh, but we all, we all, we all know a change is coming
Coming closer; sweet release, sweet release, sweet
I am calling you
I know, I know you hear me
I am calling you
Oh
