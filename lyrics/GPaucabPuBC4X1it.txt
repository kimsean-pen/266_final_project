Fuck me like you're leaving
You're the only reason my heart's beating
Heart racing uneven, pulse speeding
Your boyfriend is a lame, I could be him
Fuck me like you're leaving
Fuck me like you got no, got no feelings

Sinking feeling, wishing I was dreaming
I'm a keychain on your hook, just reel in
Dog daycare, D&G choker
Night-goer, I'm a kush blower
Pop out like a Gopher, move over
Count it like a coder, one, two, three
Four, five, six, it's over
Ecco pull up in a Rover, I'ma show her
I've been playing with my nose, now my nose hurt
I'ma hit a home run, I'm a striker, I don't like her
I hate her, I'm just playing, yeah I love her
But it's sad 'cause we don't like each other
We don't go together, fuck it I don't do this
I'ma move past it, I'ma move past it, I got it
Drain Gang, I got dirty tricks, street magician
You're not on my level so we can't do competition
I miss him, yeah R.I.P. Barron, yeah I miss him
I know we would be getting turnt in a second
Bless him, take it all to the chin, a lesson
Drain Gang, I feel like we the new One Direction
Thaiboy, yeah I said it twice, free Thaiboy
I don't want to be associated with you rappers

Fuck your little check, your party, take me off it
Fuck your free drinks, that shit just make me nauseous
I fucked up a few times, it just made me cautious
Fuck your little helping hand, yeah I got this

I'ma hold this bag, you go and pay your bosses
You can't hit me after eight cause then I'm off it
I'ma make my way, don't have to pay no bloggers
I'ma get behind the gate, yeah like a locksmith
I don't know 'bout you, but me, I fiend that darkness
Sleep, sleep-walking, burn my fucking carcass
I know they hating on the low, I caught it
Hole in my head, I'm tryna find out who God is
Baby, you're a goddess, you're flawless
I'm smoking cabbage, you're smoking on that garbage
Fuck being an artist, I still will go the hardest
You a worker, I see your ass at Target

Fuck your little check, your party, take me off it
Fuck your free drinks, that shit just make me nauseous
I fucked up a few times, it just made me cautious
Fuck your little helping hand, yeah I got this

I'ma hold this bag, you go and pay your bosses
You can't hit me after it cause then I'm off it
I'ma make my way, don't have to pay no bloggers
I'ma get behind the gate, yeah like a locksmith
