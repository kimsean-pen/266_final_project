Buck
You're a whole lot a man
Just take a look
At your great big hands
You know you can crush
Poor me in two
But gentle, oh so gentle
Are the things you do

I say I never have to worry
'Bout you goin' out
There ain't no other woman
Ain't no need to doubt
So early to bed
And early to rise
I know just what you're thinkin'
Bye the look in your eyes

I say Buck
So sweet is your back
I like to wash you
And kiss you when you're wet
So hold me close
And squeeze me till I sigh
Please love me, honey
Till the day I die

I say Buck
There ain't no other man around
Get your lover gal
To calm right down
No question 'bout the way
I feel for you
So gentle, oh so gentle
Are the things you do
Oh so gentle, oh so gentle
Are the things you do
Oh so gentle, oh so gentle
Are the things you do
