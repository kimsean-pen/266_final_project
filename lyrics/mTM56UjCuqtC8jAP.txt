There's nothing that needs to be said
We can pretend
We'll sandblast these walls and paint them again
When everything comes to an end
We can pretend
We'll sandblast these walls and paint them again
and now we're working out just what it mean
I don't know much
But I know I'll last
That I'm falling fast
And I wont come back

You say that everything's been going wrong
But we've been living our lives how we want
It's a throw away cliche but we know

There's nothing that needs to be said
We can pretend
We'll sandblast these walls and paint them again
There's nothing left for us
When everything comes to an end
We can pretend
We'll sandblast these walls and paint them again
Ohhh
No I didn't think that it would be like this

So now i gotta work out what it is I missed
Now all this love
Is sticks and stones
Being thrown round homes
Breaking bones
What did I do wrong this time

I finally found a fault
There's nothing that needs to be said

We can pretend

We'll sandblast these walls and paint them again
There's nothing left for us
When everything comes to an end
We can pretend

We'll sandblast these walls and paint them again
Ohhh
If we rebuild we can make it better
I know it's hard for you to take
I'd give it time but I don't really care
"You are falling away from yourself
and from everyone else"
There's nothing that needs to be said
We can pretend
We'll sandblast these walls and paint them again
There's nothing left for us
When everything comes to an end
We can pretend
We'll sandblast these walls and paint them again
Ohhh
