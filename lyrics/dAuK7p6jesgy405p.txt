Where's your respect?
And didn't your father teach you anything before he left?
I'm not coming back. oh no, I'm not coming back, not coming back

My mind was a fortress you knew how to rupture
Flanking the trenches and storming my bunker
Day after day, I face the wrath of what I've made
But I never thought I could feel this way at 19.

Every word she said, like knives in the back of my head
Over and over she said I'm just not cut for the weather
So take your wedding bands and your drunken friends
Cause I just can't keep you together
I'm no good, you're no better.

It's people just like you
Who made me the pessimist I am
I'm lower than the dirt
With no roots left to find
It's nice to know I wasn't worth the seven digit let down
I was left out in the cold

It's people just like you who made me the pessimist I am.
It's people just like you who made me the pessimist I am.

Every word she said, like knives in the back of my head
Over and over she said I'm just not cut for the weather
So take your wedding bands and your drunken friends
Cause I just can't keep you together
I'm no good, you're no better.

Don't point your unloaded gun at my head ever again.
Don't point your unloaded gun at my head, cause I'll pull the trigger.
