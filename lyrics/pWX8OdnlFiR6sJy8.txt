He didn't mean to catch my eye
Well he's lucky he just walked on by
'Cause he hasn't met a girl like me
Are you kidding?
Well I'd tell him that I'd rather die

He doesn't mean a thing to me
Just another pretty face to see
He's all over town, knockin' 'em down 'a honey
And I'd never let him next to me

He's the kind of guy who thinks he's smart
He's the type that always looks the part
It's all in the make, it's all in the take 'a honey
And I'd never let him touch my heart

He didn't mean to catch my eye
Well he's lucky he just walked on by
'Cause he hasn't met a girl like me
Are you kidding?
Well I'd tell him that I'd rather die
