I've done my time of waiting
done my time for life
I'm gonna leave and find my way out
You had me over thinking but I've realized
That all you did was wrong, I was right
Have you been feeling sad lately?
You need my help again
Been kind of low and you... you need a friend
Sentimental words to me
Won't be the same again
Life doesn't hurt without you!

And now I'm on the top of the pyramids, unwind
And I'm never gonna come back down
So if somebody trying to take me out
Better not be scared of heights
I'm on the top of the pyramids, unwind
And I'm never gonna come back down
So if somebody trying to take me out
Better not be scared of heights

I used to run for cover
Running into the wild
I shut my mouth, and never ask twice
I guess it's hard to be brave when you're paralyzed
But now I see the truth in your lies
Have you been feeling sad lately?
You need my help again
Been kind of low and you... you need a friend
Sentimental words to me
Won't be the same again
Life doesn't hurt without you!

And now I'm on the top of the pyramids, unwind
And I'm never gonna come back down
So if somebody trying to take me out
Better not be scared of heights!
I'm on the top of the pyramids, unwind
And I'm never gonna come back down
So if somebody trying to take me out
Better not be scared of heights!

What you need from me?
What you need from me when all that you need is the love?
What you need from me?
What you need from me when all that you need is the love?

And now I'm on the top of the pyramids, unwind
And I'm never gonna come back down
So if somebody trying to take me out
Better not be scared of heights!
I'm on the top of the pyramids, unwind
And I'm never gonna come back down
So if somebody trying to take me out
Better not be scared of heights!

I'm never coming back down
Better not be scared of heights!
I'm never coming back down
Better not be scared of heights!
I'm never coming back down
Better not be scared of heights!
I'm never coming back down
Better not be scared of heights!
