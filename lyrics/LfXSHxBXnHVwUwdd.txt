Any day now can't you see
You'll be coming back to me
Comin' back to where you wanna be
And the time that you've been gone
Will vanish like the song
Sung by the rain when we were fast asleep

And our days will be filled by the light of children's laughter
All our nights will be touched by the glow of lover's songs
Side by side in the sun we will build the world we're after
Side by side we will lie when the day's good work is done

Any day now can't you see
You'll be sitin' here by me
Laughing at the fools we used to be
And the things that we've done wrong
Will be now dead and gone
Buried out beneath our apple tree

And our days will be filled by the light of children's laughter
All our nights will be touched by the glow of lover's songs
Side by side in the sun we will build the world we're after
Side by side we will lie when the day's good work is done

I Love You
