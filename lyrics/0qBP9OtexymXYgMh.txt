Guilty
It seeps through the ceiling
A sinking feeling
I'm kneeling

Don't you see the colors are bleeding?
Your touch is misleading
I'm pleading

Have you ever felt the prying?
When nothings exciting
Stop trying

Dumb angel
Dumb angel

Perfect
A gift worth receiving
Now I'm believing
I need it

Swallow
Your ideas are borrowed
You fake all your sorrow
You're hollow

Don't you love when everything's ending?
And you're still pretending you're living?

Dumb angel
Dumb angel
