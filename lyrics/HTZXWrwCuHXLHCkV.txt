Angry words and honking cars
Satellites and falling stars

Distant dark blue radios that whisper down my boulevards
Ghosts and chains rattle in the attic
Broken headphones filled with static

Lonely room you've got nowhere to run

3, 2, 1 for all and all for 1
Times will be bad times will be good
Things I wish I hadn't done and somehow wish I would
Cutting through the American noise
You've got a voice and a song to sing (and a song to sing)
Drink deep in the morning
Drink deep in the morning

See what the day will bring
La da da da
Lift up your voice
Let love cut through the American noise
La da da da
Lift up your voice

Let love cut through the American noise
Slamming doors and cell phone rings
Hurricane force of silent screams
Don't know what to believe
Bend the rule just to break it
You're so tired 'cause to got to fake it

But you just wanna be someone

3, 2, 1 for all and all for 1
Times will be bad times will be good
Things I wish I hadn't done and somehow wish I would
Cutting through the American noise
You've got a voice and a song to sing (and a song to sing)
Drink deep in the morning
Drink deep in the morning

See what the day will bring
La da da da
Lift up your voice
Let love cut through the American noise
La da da da
Lift up your voice

Let love cut through the American noise
No matter who you are you've got a voice
Why don't you use it
Sing your own song take all the noise

And make it into music
La da da da
La da da da
La da da da a
La da da da
La da da da
La da da da a
La da da da lift up your voice
Let love cut through the American noise
La da da da you have a choice
Let love cut through the American noise
You've got a voice
Let love cut through the American noise
