I still remember the night you tried to kiss me through the window
I tried to settle for the taste of touching glass over the sound of answering machines
Because I love the way your voice says it's gonna get back to me someday
As I brace my knees you hold me down with your eyes

Someday I'll drive, close both my eyes
We'll swim in circles in the blue lights
It's gonna be the best day of my life
And oh my God, you'll never be as beautiful without me
Beauty needs an animal to breathe.
And baby you'll be alright as long as I'm not
So do that dance in the dark
Sharpen your teeth and bite as hard as you want

Someday I'll drive, close both my eyes
We'll swim in circles in the blue lights
And I just want to fade away into the sky under the sea
A million kisses underwater as we walk into the ocean
Oh, no
This is gonna be the best day (of my life)
A celebration of an ending

Come on!
And do you really trust your tongue
Or did you bury the taste?
And is this fantasy real

Or is it all home-made?
And did you call me last night just 'cause you couldn't get laid?
Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce the Selfish Machine

(Yeah, that's fuckin' right)
Do you think you're the only one! Afraid!
Do you think you're the only one! Afraid!
Do you think you're the only one afraid of this machine?
Oooh
Someday I'll drive, close both my eyes
I'll be your breath if you can be mine
And I just want to fade away into the sky under the sea
A million kisses underwater as we walk into the ocean
Oh, no
Oh, no
(1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4...)
And do you see me at all under the tall waves?
Do you see me at all?
(La da da da da da da da... Da da da da da da...)
