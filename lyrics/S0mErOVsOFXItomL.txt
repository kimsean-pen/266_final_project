"You are our prodigy, our newest kinsman
Our wing of darkness; Arise, Femto."

Something vicious and vile is taking shape
Hatching out of the darkness as it wakes
Going after a sweet forbidden fruit
Evil has never felt so fucking good

I steal your sanity, betray your heart and let it bleed
Burn down your paradise and drain your love
I stain your purity, become thy faithful enemy
Defile your womanhood before his eyes

Broken lovers and prisoners of fate
In the center of heartlessness and pain
Run away, run away, there's no escape
From the powers that feed on your despair

Pleasure's high, now you're mine

I steal your sanity, betray your heart and let it bleed
Burn down your paradise and drain your love
I stain your purity, become thy faithful enemy
Defile your womanhood before his eyes

I steal your sanity, betray your heart and let it bleed
Burn down your paradise and drain your love
I stain your purity, become thy faithful enemy
Defile your womanhood before his eyes
