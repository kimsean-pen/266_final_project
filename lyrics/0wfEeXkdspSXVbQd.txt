Sometimes at night I let it get to me
And sometimes I'm sure it gets to all of us
And last night it had me down and feeling numb
I can try but sometimes that is not enough

No sometimes that is not enough
No sometimes that is not enough

And stop calling me out we're never going to
Put the pieces back together
If you won't let me get better
And stop digging it up or we're never gonna
See it all in bloom

And thinking back upon those days
Way way back when I was young
I was such a little shit
Cos I was always on the run
Well you know just what they say
Just like father then like son
Don't delude me with your sympathy
Cos I can do this on my own

And this will be the last time
That I break down and wanna crawl to bed
Cos the truth is
You're the only voice I wanna hear in my head

So stop calling me out we're never going to
Put the pieces back together
If you won't let me get better
And stop digging it up or we're never gonna
See it all in bloom

And stop calling me out we're never going to
Put the pieces back together
If you won't let me get better
And stop digging it up or we're never gonna
See it all in bloom

All in bloom
All in bloom
