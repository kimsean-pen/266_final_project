I want a perfect moment
I want to go tonight
I want see the star shoot out of
A pitch black sky
I want to start a fire
I wanna burn tonight
I want a world in motion
I want to see the signs
Race through my mind

All I want now is a white light moment
Come with me tonight
Monochrome city the color's fading
Watching the world in your eyes
Take me around the planet
Take me through space and time
Paint me a perfect picture and
Make sure you cross the line
Don't let the colours scare you
It's just a state of mind
We'll stay out of sight

All I want now is a white light moment
Come with me tonight
Monochrome city the color's fading
Watching the world in your eyes
I want a perfect moment
I want to go tonight
I want see the star shoot out of
A pitch black sky
I want a world in motion
I want to see the signs
Race through my mind

All I want now is a white light moment
Come with me tonight
Monochrome city the color's fading
Watching the world in your eyes
in your eyes
in your eyes
