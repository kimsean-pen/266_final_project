Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone

Have a feelin', now believin'
That you were the one
I was meant to be with
Oh, how I'm wishin'
Thinkin', dreamin' 'bout you
And the love, how'd I let you get away
Got 'til it's gone
Got 'til it's gone

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone

If I could turn back hands of time
Make you fall in love
In love with me again
So would you give me another chance to love
To love you, love you the right way
No games
Got 'til it's gone
Got 'til it's gone

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's
Yeah, let me just fuck with it for a minute
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone

Now you are realizing when the nights go long, right
Campaign for me to stay
When you know that I'm gone, right
You act all wild
When I tell you to settle
I was working 'round the clock
But you girls want to meddle
Talkin' about, I heard he swims with his chick on the beach

That was out with the tide
But my love you impeached
Now you lookin' at the walls
Head in hand, cold jonezin'
Ringing my house
Hang up and posing

Now why you wanna go and do that
Love huh
Now why you wanna go and do that
And do that? Huh
Now why you wanna go and do that
Love huh
Now why you wanna go and do that
And do that? Huh

Now why you wanna go and do that
Love huh
Now why you wanna go and do that
And do that? Huh
Now why you wanna go and do that
Love huh
Now why you wanna go and do that
And do that? And do that

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone

That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
