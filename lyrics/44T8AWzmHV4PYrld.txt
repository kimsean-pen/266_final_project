Lala lalala lalala lala lalala
Lala lalala lalala lala lalala

Far and wide
High and low
Close your eyes
We up in smoke
Swim the sky
Here we go
Round and round
The reefer blows

Far and wide
High and low
Close your eyes
We up in smoke
Swim the sky
Here we go
Round and round
The reefer blows

As it travels through your lungs back out, I see it swirl
Now you're feeling I'm without a care in the world
But that's what happens when you come see the doctor
I dont care what the feds say, fucking cockblockers
I live in reefer land, I grow a little reefer and you wanna get high?
I'll make you fly like Peter Pan
On cloud nine no one but the reefer can
I'm the reefer king of Cali known as Reefer Man
I recommend you don't tell a friend, they will buy it out
Then they never leave you nothing in the end
I could never grow enough, so people want my secret
But you don't get to peep it
You're a ninja if you seek it

Far and wide
High and low
Close your eyes
We up in smoke
Swim the sky
Here we go
Round and round
The reefer blows

I have so many different strains
I choose break 'em down in samples
Make sure you get the one you want and know what you can handle
Got the indo and sativa, gonna make you a believa
Yeah my brand is off the meter and the flavor so much sweeter
You wanna blow some trees, you wanna smoke some real shit?
Put it in the paper, roll it with the Phuncky Feel Tip
Then put it in the air, smoke rises to the heavens
Ash falls to the ground, cash, doubles up in seconds
OG Kush from Cali from the Valley to the Playground
People on the street wanna call this one the lay-down
The highest sold like '57 Chevy, heavy
Feeling ready for a steady dose as the reefer blows

Far and wide
High and low
Close your eyes
We up in smoke
Swim the sky
Here we go
Round and round
The reefer blows

Far and wide
High and low
Close your eyes
We up in smoke
Swim the sky
Here we go
Round and round
The reefer blows
