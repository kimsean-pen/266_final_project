O, ne moriar bis, oro supplex

Sometimes I feel like my reason is weakening
My inner clock's forcing time to stand still
I'm breaching borders between life and sanity
That's when it all starts to shatter in front of me

Liberate me
Why don't you liberate me?

Sometimes I feel I'm betraying my memory
This time it seems that I'm losing the fight
Finding it hard to be consciously part of life
That's when awareness and dreams start to separate

Reunite me
It's time to reunite me

As time goes by I hide the truth
Cannot stand myself with a broken shell
As time goes by I try to choose
Don't know where to roam in this private hell
Give me relief
Let me believe between sweet fiction and reality

My train of thoughts got lost somewhere along the way
I'm chasing shadows that cross on my path
Repeating visions that dance faster than my mind
Can't stop the rain casting shadows on my parade

Can't defeat me
I will not bow to defeat

As time goes by I hide the truth
Cannot stand myself with a broken shell
As time goes by I try to choose
Don't know where to roam in this private hell
Give me relief
Let me believe between sweet fiction and reality

Ne moriar bis

Another life, another mind close to insanity
Another road, a cryptic code the second stone

All that is left is a cross that's mine to bear
A curse with no ending drenched in anxiety

O, ne discedam bis, oro supplex

As time goes by I hide the truth
Cannot stand myself with a broken shell
Give me relief
Let me believe between sweet fiction and reality

As time goes by I try to choose
Don't know where to roam in this private hell
Give me relief
Let me believe between sweet fiction and reality

Ne moriar bis
