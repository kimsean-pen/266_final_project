Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love

You take my body, I give you heat
You say you hungry, I give you meat
I suck your mind, you blow my head
Make love (Make love) inside your bed

Everybody get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love

Every time I get hot, you wanna cool down
Every time I get high, you say you wanna come down
You say it's enough, in fact, it's too much
Every time I get a, get down, get down
Get down, make love

(Get down) I can squeeze, (make love) you can shake me
(Get down) I can feel (make love) when you break me
(Get down) Come on so heavy (make love)
(Get down) When you take me (make love) you make love, you make love
(Get down) You make love, you make love
(Make love) You can make everybody
Get down, make love
Get down, make love

Every time I get high, you wanna come down
Every time I get hot, you say you want to cool down
You say it's enough, in fact, it's too much
Every time I wanna get down, get down
Get down

Make love, make love, make love, make love

Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love

Every time I get hot, you wanna cool down
Every time I get high, you say you wanna come down
You say it's enough, in fact, it's just too much
Every time I wanna get down, get down
Get down, make love
