I was done talking, but I still couldn't sleep
I rolled out my medicine, to forget me
I tried not to disappoint you, but I didn't achieve
Cause I have a problem, and I need to get some

I shouldn't waste my time
Having you around
What was up's gone down
You take your road, and I'll take mine

I don't want to talk about it unlike you
Your victim hid your character, it defines you
And then you rearrange it, caress it into view
You invent your problems, and then you sell them

So help me, why can't this be love?
Tell me, why can't this be enough?
When is high ever high enough?
It's all I've ever hoped for

I shouldn't waste my time
Having you around
What was up's gone down
You take your road, and I'll take mine

So swallow your problems
We belong to a new dawn
So swallow your problems
We belong to a new dawn

(So swallow)
If she asks should I tell her?
(your problems)
If she asks should I let her know?
(we belong)
We'll never be together
(to a new dawn)
We'll never see each other grow

I shouldn't waste my time
Having you around
What was up's gone down
You take your road, and I'll take mine

I was done talking, but I still couldn't sleep
