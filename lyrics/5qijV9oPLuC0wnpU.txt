In the corner of my eye
Her arms are clutching saving slowly time
Ask away just to cover up
All the people tell her how to live
But she lives so much that she can't give

She starts crying in public places
She starts hiding familiar faces

She says
She says

It feels different every time
Not knowing what she'll end up with this night
Just a smile to cover up
All the people judge the way she lives
But she lives so much that she can't give

She starts crying in public places
She starts hiding familiar faces

She says
She says

She says
She says
She says
She says
