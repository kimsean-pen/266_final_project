Shine, shine your light...
Shine, shine your light...

Too much of, too much of, too much of a good thing...
Too much of, too much of, too much of a good thing...

six one, space, out, waste of modern ground...
underground...
six one, rapes me, rips out, burn the streets...

all the time, all the time, all the time...

Shine your light on me, shine your light on me...
shine your light on me, shine your light on me...
shine your light on me...
