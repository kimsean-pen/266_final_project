You never told me why you had to leave
I always thought that you'd come back for me
I'm tired of getting people's sympathy
I know I'd make it back eventually

But I was spinning in the void
I was lost and paranoid
And I'm missing you now

There might as well be space
Right outside my window
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody out there?
I'm followed by your ghost
I'm stepping on your shadow
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody out there?

I need you now, now, now, now, now
I need you now, now, now, now, now

I'm not saying it's for you to hear
I'm just trying to clear my atmosphere
Taking off to try to work it out
The trouble's smaller when you're looking down

There's always silence in the void
And I kinda miss the noise
Of having you 'roundThere might as well be space
Right outside my window
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody out there?
I'm followed by your ghost
I'm stepping on your shadow
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody out there?

I need you now, now, now, now, now
I need you now, now, now, now, now

There might as well be space
Right outside my window
Is there anybody out there?

There might as well be space
Right outside my window
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody out there?
I'm followed by your ghost
I'm stepping on your shadow
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody out there?

There might as well be space
Right outside my window
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody out there?
I'm followed by your ghost
I'm stepping on your shadow
Is there anybody out there?
Anybody out there?

I need you now, now, now, now, now
