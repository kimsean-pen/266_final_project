Believe, the news,
I'm gone, for good,
Call off the search,
No one will know that I'm down here,
Believe the note,
I left, for you
You can't turn back the clocks,
You can't pull me up from here so don't try.

In a car underwater with time to kill,
Thinking back I forgot to tell you this,
I didn't care that you left and abandoned me,
What hurts more is I would still die for you.

Make time slower,
Give me longer,
It's too late for me,
No one will know that I am down here,
And believe your dreams,
Of me sinking,
So far, below,
You cant pull me up from here so don't try.

Thinking back I forgot to tell you this,

Leave it up to me,
To burden you again,
This one's not your fault,
Please forgive me.

Leave it up to me,
To burden you again,
This ones not your fault,
So forget so forget so forget me.

Don't think back don't think back on me at all,
Just let me go,
Don't think back don't think back on me at all,
Just let me go,
Don't think back don't think back on me at all,
(let me go)
Don't think back don't think back on me at all,

Don't think back don't think back on me at all.
