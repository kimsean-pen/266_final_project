I don't wanna hear it again
You're always getting stuck in my head
All the things
You think that I'm supposed to be

Don't worry about the way that I am
Cause that's the only way
That I plan on being
So forget trying to take my dreams from me

And I'm not sorry
That I'm not just like everybody else
And I'm not sorry
Cause that would mean I'm not cool with myself

And sometimes
I can feel like I'm the only one with pain
Pray that I'll be OK
At the end of the day

I hate being alone in the dark
But I'm still gonna follow my heart
And no one is ever gonna make me stop

So many things
That I wanna do
So many walls
I'm gonna break through
Someone on the other side
I hope is you

Will you be there
Holding my hand when I fall down?
Will you be there
Trying to make me change
And be the same as you?

I don't wanna be like you
I don't wanna be like you

At the end of the day
I'm not sorry
I'm not sorry
At the end of the day
