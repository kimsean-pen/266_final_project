Move closer, set my mind on fire
taking over
the world seems so alive
the world seems so alive
she slips into the night, and she is gone
gone to set the score, gone into the town
rain shining in her eyes
her brother started school
again today
a thought to pass the time,
to occupy my mind
while i'm waiting for her
down in the basement
listening to the rain
thinking things over
i think it over again
think it over again
she slipped into the night, and she is gone
gone to set the score, gone into the town
rain shining in her eyes
her brother started school
again today
a thought to pass the time,
to occupy my mind
while i'm waiting for her
i'm riding it down
listening to the rain
she'll be here soon
i lie back and drift away
i lie back and drift away
she slipped into the night, and she is gone
gone to set the score, gone into the town
rain shining in her eyes
her brother started school
again today
a thought to pass the time,
to occupy my mind
while i'm waiting for her
i'm feeling so alive
feeling so real
on this stormy night
the rain is coming down
rain like never before
i've got some records on
and some bottles of wine
on this stormy night
the rain is lashing down
and i'm waiting for her
