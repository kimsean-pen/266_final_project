This city is my city
And I love it, yeah, I love it
I was born and raised here
I got it made here
And if I have my way, I'm gonna stay

From every corner
To every block, yeah
And whether it's warm, or storming, or down right stupid hot, hot
From the problems, all the way to the solutions yeah
Forget all the drugs and gangs, corruption and pollution, no

'Cause this city is my city
And I love it, yeah, I love it
I was born and raised here
I got it made here
And if I have my way, I'm gonna stay here
For life, uh, huh
For life, uh, huh
For life, uh, huh
For life, uh, huh
For life, uh, huh
For life, uh, huh
For life, uh, huh
For life, uh, huh

Now what if I told you my city was the best
And my city was a threat to the rest
But you can't rest inside my city
My city's so cold if you ain't dressed
And what they accept, better had a right address
Come to my city, certain colors can't step
And sadly I'm talking about the color of your skin
Sorry my brother can't let you in
Cause the property value might go down to a level that's

Economically unacceptable and socially taboo fast to live around you
Uh, uh, is this what it's down to?
Roof for the same team, ngga had the same dream
Not the same reality
Actually, mines is a bad education and gentrification
Despite all the above I love...

This city is my city
And I love it, yeah I love it
I was born and raised here
I got it made here
And if I have my way, I'm gonna stay here
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh

And you can take it back
Picture, you can take it back
But you're never gonna take my city away
Cause you can burn it to the ground
Oh or let it flood, but it's in my blood

Cause this city is my city
And I love it, yeah I love it
I was born and raised here
I got it made here
And if I have my way, I'm gonna stay here
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life, uh huh
For life...
