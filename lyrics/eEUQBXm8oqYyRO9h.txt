Here am I
The divided self
My head spinning like a carousel
The world outside may still be beautiful
But I love this cell

Come over
You are still sane
I could give you just a little brawn if you give me a little brains
It's a mess in here, I've been drinking
Myself blind again

My legs are numb, I just can't get up
Will you stay through the theatre
Of my self-pity, my lechery?

I'm waiting for your guiding light to bring me back
I'm waiting for your guiding light to bring me back
To the power and the glory
To the power and the glory

Send messages
Old suggestive shit
I know that it will catch me up, but I just can't help it
There's an emptiness in my core
It's embarrassing

Reel me in
Yes I will confess
I'm numb and I don't give a fuck 'cause it's all just surface
Why can't you and I just let go
And take all the risks?

My legs are numb, I just can't get up
Will you stay through the theatre
Of my self-pity, my lechery?

I'm waiting for your guiding light to bring me back
I'm waiting for your guiding light to bring me back
To the power and the glory
To the power and the glory

I'm waiting for your guiding light to bring me back
I'm waiting for your guiding light to bring me back
