different words
empty mouths
dead faces
in a shadow world

i've seen one season
i've felt only cold
i'm so alone

ride over
fall within
shadows follow
swallow me

a face in the window
it thinks but it's senseless
it sees but it's blind
it sounds but it's dead

mesmerized in loneliness
into colourful walls
my shadow, my company
it will last so long

once again in my window
this winter will last forever
