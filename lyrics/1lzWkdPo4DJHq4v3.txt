Life's greatest questions have always been...
Who am I? Where did I come from?
Why am I here? Where am I going?
You are about to see and hear
one of the most significant messages given to us by God.

GET DOWN!
Whoo!
GET DOWN!

I'm lying to myself
And this dagger's my excuse
I'm a pawn
I should have paid up
And I left an hour late
I was laid up

I must abuse myself
I'm against all that I've made up
Set in stone, the sun will come
And I hate light
You know I hate light
Don't make it look so pretty burning

Burn the sun
Burn the light
Take take take take take take it away
Take my hand
Take my life
Take take take take take take it away

I must have caught something
In the heat of all these dances
I'm a worm with no more chances
And I've lost all doubt
In a chemical romance

I can't stop itching
Over thoughts of tarnished hope
Kinda funny
Lonely Feeling
I'm not in love
You know it's not love
Don't make it look so pretty burning

Burn the sun
Burn the light
Take take take take take take it away
Take my hand
Take my life
Take take take take take take it away

Burn the sun
Burn the light
Take take take take take take it away
Take my hand
Take my life
Take take take take take take it away

Brothers and sisters
I'm right here with you
Cause everyone's got one
A story to kill me
I'm so apathetic in my resentment
Living, loving, knowing not...

Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand

Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my... life!

(Take my life... Take my life...)

Take my heart
Take my mind
Take my lungs
Take my... LIFE!

Burn the sun
Burn the light
Take take take take take take it away
Take my hand
Take my life
Take take take take take take it away

Burn the sun
Burn the light
Take take take take take take it away
Take my hand
Take my life
Take my life
Take my life...
