Another memory and I'm asking myself
Why can't I let the past be the past
Once and for all take a hold of the future
And not let it control what I aspire to have
I see where my decisions have brought me
What's done is done and it's time to start again
Can't let it tear me in two, or waste me away
I gotta believe

'Cause this is now (now)
How can I change tomorrow if I can't change today
This is now (now)
If I control myself I control my destiny
This is now (now)
How can I change tomorrow if I can't change today
This is now (now)
If I control myself I control my destiny

What I've seen and what I've been through has made me who I am
There was a time in my life where I had no desire to carry on
I couldn't see a place for me or a will to survive
I never thought to rely on myself or the beliefs that I had denied

But this is now (now)
How can I change tomorrow if I can't change today
This is now (now)
If I control myself I control my destiny
This is now (now)
How can I change tomorrow if I can't change today
This is now (now)
If I control myself I control my destiny

If I control myself
I control my tomorrow
I got to change today
'Cause this is now

Now (now)
Now (now)
This is now
How can I change tomorrow if I can't change today
I must control myself if I'm to control my destiny

'Cause this is now
This is now

This is now (now)
How can I change tomorrow if I can't change today
This is now (now)
If I control myself I control my destiny
This is now (now)
How can I change tomorrow if I can't change today
This is now (now)
If I control myself I control my destiny
