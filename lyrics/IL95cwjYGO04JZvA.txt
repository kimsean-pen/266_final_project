Darling
What you gonna do now
Now that you noticed
It all went wrong
I've been
I've been thinking
That you don't know me
Anymore

Don't let the sun be the one
To change you baby
I wanna learn how to lie
If I'm to know
'Cause I wanna go where the people go
'Cause I'm forever lost

Darling
What you gonna say now
Now that you noticed
It all went wrong
Looks like I'm driving
My friends all crazy
Oh, they say that they don't know me
Anymore

Don't let the sun be the one
To change you baby
I wanna learn how to lie
If I'm to know
'Cause I wanna go where the people go
'Cause I'm forever lost
Oh yeah I'm forever lost

Looks like it all went wrong
What am I to do, what am I to do?
Looks like it all went wrong
What am I to do, what am I to do?

Looks like it all went wrong
What am I to do, what am I to do?
Looks like it all went wrong

Don't let the sun be the one
To change you baby
I wanna learn how to lie
If I'm to know
'Cause I wanna go where the people go
'Cause I'm forever lost
Oh yeah I'm forever lost

Darling
What you gonna do now
Now that you noticed
It all went wrong (what you gonna do know?)
Oh, now that you noticed
(What you gonna do know?)
Oh, now that you noticed
