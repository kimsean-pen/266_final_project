To be lost in the forest, to be cut adrift
You've been trying to reach me
You bought me a book
To be lost in the forest, to be cut adrift
I've been paid, I've been paid

To be lost in the forest, to be cut adrift
You've been trying to reach me
You bought me a book
To be lost in the forest, to be cut adrift
I've been paid, I've been paid, I've been

Don't get offended if I seem absent minded
Just keep telling me facts and keep making me smile
And don't get offended if I seem absent minded
I get tongue-tied

Baby, you've got to be more discerning
I've never known what's good for me
Baby, you've got to be more demanding
I will be yours

I'll pay for you anytime
I'll pay for you anytime

And you told me you wanted to eat up my sadness
Well, jump right on shorty, you can gorge away
And you told me you wanted to eat up my sadness

Jump right
Baby, you've got to be more discerning
I've never known what's good for me

And baby, you've got to be more demanding
Jump right
What are you holding out for?
What's always in the way?

Why so damn absent-minded?
Why so scared of romance?
This modern love breaks me
This modern love wastes me
This modern love breaks me
This modern love wastes me
Do you wanna come over and kill some time?
Do you wanna come over and kill some time?
Do you wanna come over and kill some time?
Throw your arms around me
