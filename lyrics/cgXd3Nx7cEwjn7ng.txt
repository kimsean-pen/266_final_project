Loathesome spell, which cast I do covertly
Gruesome spell, so tenderly forged just for you

Eternal life will haunt you
Eternal pain

From roots to moons
From roots to moons

From roots to moons
Death is my name
From roots to moons
We are the same

From roots to moons
Death is my name
From roots to moons
We are the same

Clandestine spell
You'll never know what it holds

Eternal life will haunt you
Eternal pain

From roots to moons
Death is my name
From roots to moons
We are the same

From roots to moons
Death is my name
From roots to moons
We are the same

You, you are the chosen one
For you, you'll never see me again

From roots to moons
Death is my name
From roots to moons
We are the same

From roots to moons
Death is my name
From roots to moons
We are the same
