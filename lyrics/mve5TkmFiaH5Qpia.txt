In the corner, I can see him standing there
In the jacket and ripped jeans you used to wear
This is crazy, can't escape you
I just can't seem to erase you
So I undress just to cover up the pain
But it's useless
All the layers are the same
It's ironic that I do this
I don't miss you, but the truth is

That he felt like you
And he kissed like you
Yeah, he walks like you, talks like you
Just like you
And for a second, it was like I was touched by you
Touched by you

Ain't it funny how the thought of you now makes me numb?
Yet you haunt me when I just wanna have some fun
Busy trying to replace you with this boy I can't relate to
In his bedroom, I can smell you on the sheets
Your favourite perfume
I guess it brought back memories
I admit I'm going through it
Close my eyes, because the truth is

That he looks like you
(He looks like you)
And he tastes like you
(He tastes like you)
Yeah, he walks like you, talks like you
Just like you
And for a second, it was like I was touched by you
(Touched by you)
Touched by you
(Touched by you)
Yes, you know that he held me like you
(Held me like you)
With his hands like you
(Hands like you)
Made me laugh like you, laugh like you
Fucks like you
And for a second, if only for a second
It was like I was touched by you
(Touched by you)
Touched by you
(Touched by you)
(Touched by you)

And it felt like
(Touched by you)
That's what it felt like
For a second
It was like I was touched by you
(Touched by you)
Touched by you
(Touched by you)
It was like I was touched by you
(Touched by you)
Baby, it's like I felt you on my skin once again
For a second
It was like I was touched by you
Touched by you
Understood?
