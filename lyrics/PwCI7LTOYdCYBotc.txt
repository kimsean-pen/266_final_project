He told me I belong in a churchyard
He told me I could walk away but I wouldn't get far
Tell me how do people know what is hurt, what is love?
He told me I belong in a churchyard

Words pointy like arrows
Wounds no one can see
He closed all the windows
As his anger broke free
I will not remember
You as somebody nice
Please will you remember me
And cry?

He told me I belong in a churchyard
He told me I could walk away but I wouldn't get far
Tell me how do people know what is hurt, what is love?
He told me I belong in a churchyard

Hate followed him gently
Planted seeds in his heart
Roots tearing the love in him
Apart

He told me I belong in a churchyard
He told me I could walk away but I wouldn't get far
Tell me how do people know what is hurt, what is love?
He told me I belong in a churchyard
