Your eyes are blue, your kisses too
I never knew what they could do
I can't believe that you're in love with me

You're telling everyone I know
I'm on your mind, each place you go
They can't believe you're in love with me

I have always placed you far above me
I just can't imagine that you love me
And after all is said and done it looks like I'm the lucky one
I can't believe that you're in love with me
