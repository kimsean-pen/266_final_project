Can we love until there's nothing left
And we're collecting dust (dust)
Use the hell out of outgolden souls
Until we're flecks of rust (rust)

A love so deep, nothing else like it
Scars go deep, but they can't find it
Flame so bright make the daylight look dark (dark)

Cross my heart that I'd die for ya
Cross my heart that I'll always keep ya
Cross my heart like a bitter sweet tattoo (tattoo)

And we go
Oh, you're my kingdom come
Oh, you're my kingdom come
So sit me on your throne
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Let it intertwine your hand in mine
And fill the empty space (space)
All the demons cry 'cause you and I
Found love in a broken place (place)

A love so deep, nothing else like it
Scars go deep, but they can't find it
Flame so bright make the daylight look dark (dark)

Cross my heart that I'd die for ya
Cross my heart that I'll always keep ya
Cross my heart like a bitter sweet tattoo (tatto)

And we go
Oh, you're my kingdom come
Oh, you're my kingdom come
Sit me on your throne
Yeah, (yeah)
Yeah, (yeah)
Yeah

Iggs
Gather around, now I'm back from my holiday
"Long live the queen" what the people say
And that be me I got a king in my cavalry
Them other knights say goodnight
They get apathy

You'll never catch an Adam without Eve
You'll never catch a Blue without Steve
See what I mean you're my Caesar, burn my chariot
You know Family Matters, what's Carl without Harriot?

Inseperable like Mary Kate and Ashley
Incredible, I'm ready if you ask me, to ride on them
Them meaning chicks ya feel me?
I break 'em down, it's a sport, I should win an Espy

Royalty another level, boy your throne shine
Legendary love, the nation needs a paradigm
Call all the king's horses and all the kingsmen
We rule until the end (kingdom come)

And we go
Oh, you're my kingdom come
Oh, you're my kingdom come
Sit me on your throne
Yeah

You're my kingdom come
So sit me on your throne
Yeah

You're my kingdom come
So sit me on your throne
