Every year, exactly this time of year
Let go a balloon up into the air
And hold on to one who is near
Remember everything is here

Every year, about this time of year
I am with you as if you are here
I remember the way it fell through
You and all we all could do

Watch your step
Take good care
Don't touch that
Don't stand there
Fire is hot
Steel can cut
Glass will break
If you're not--

I hope that you will be careful
The stories you told were hopeful
I hope that they aren't just artful
I hope that you will be careful
