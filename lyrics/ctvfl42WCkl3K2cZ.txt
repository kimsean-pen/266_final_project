I wish it didn't hurt, hurt like this
To say these things to you
I'll sacrifice one moment for one truth

If we get though tomorrow then we'll be fine
(Then we'll be fine)
We'll wait for
(We'll wait for)
Forever and see how close we get

It's just another day
One more chance to get this right
I'll sacrifice forever, please just for tonight

If we get though tomorrow then we'll be fine
(Then we'll be fine)
We'll wait for
(We'll wait for)
Forever and see how close we get, we get

(The worst is over for now)
Take a breath, now let it out
The worst is over for now
Take a breath, now let it out
The worst is over for now
