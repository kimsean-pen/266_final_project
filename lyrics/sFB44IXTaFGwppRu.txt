I don't wanna be here
Take me away
I don't wanna be here
Take me away
Festival coming up, it's so last minute
I don't wanna go but my friend got me tickets
A 5-hour drive, we arrive at the campsite
Put our phones away 'cause there ain't any Wi-Fi
No-one to talk to except who you're with
So we post by the car and pass around a fifth
Trying to fit in, I drink 'til I'm sick
The gates open up and it's time to head in
Did my friends slip Molly in my drink?
Starts to hit me and then we sing
"I'm on my way, I'm on my way
We're on our way, we're on our way"
I don't wanna be here
Take me away
I don't wanna be here
Take me away
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here
(Take me away)
Night hits and I'm standing
Still while a crowd full of bodies is dancing
Music is loud, lights are so blinding
I can't see my friends but they're right behind me
Feeling the beat, I turn to my left
Girl of my dreams and now I'm obsessed
Move a bit closer, I ask for a name
I couldn't hear but it started with K
Just like our first kiss, it was pure bliss
I found love in a place I thought was hopeless
Now I'm glad I stayed
I come back every year but I still say
I don't wanna be here
Take me away
I don't wanna be here
Take me away
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here
(Take me away)
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here
(I don't wanna be here)
