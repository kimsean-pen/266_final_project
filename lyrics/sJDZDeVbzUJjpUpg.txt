I know where this is headed
Yeah, I've seen it all before
So many of 'em like you on the block
If you wanna come and get it
Then you better be sure
'Cause I know where this is headed, make it stop
Tryna mess with my mind
But I'm trapped on both sides
Better hurry up or you don't have a prayer
I know where this is headed
Yeah I've seen it all before
I don't really wanna watch you running scared
Oh, oh oh oh,
not even tryna fall in love
But oh, oh oh oh,
you ain't gonna keep me in these cuffs
Boy, you drive me crazy
Don't wanna wait, just get me what I want
'Cause so when I get angry
It's like looking down the barrel of a gun
I know you like to play with fire, fire
But if you get too close, you might get burnt
So you better ru, ru, ru, ru, ru, ru, run
And take no prisoner
Yes, me in your corner
And you roll the windows down
Sorry, but for me that's not enough
You just keep it moving
Like you've heard a siren sound
And you don't even stop to show me love
Tryna mess with my mind
But I'm trapped on both sides
Trust me, you don't wanna hear that click
Sit me on your corner
And you roll your windows down
I don't think before we're acting quick
Oh, oh oh oh,
Not even tryna fall in love
But oh, oh oh oh,
You ain't gonna keep me in these cuffs
Boy, you drive me crazy
Don't wanna wait, just get me what I want
'Cause so when I get angry
It's like looking down the barrel of a gun
I know you like to play with fire, fire
But if you get too close, you might get burnt
So you better ru, ru, ru, ru, ru, ru, run
And take no prisoner
So stand up, stand up
Both hands where I can see
Stand up, stand up
You're not enough
Enough for me
Stand up, stand up
Both hands where I can see
Stand up, stand up
You're not enough
Enough for me
Boy, you drive me crazy
Don't wanna wait, just get me what I want
'Cause so when I get angry
It's like looking down the barrel of a gun
I know you like to play with fire, fire
But if you get too close, you might get burnt
So you better ru, ru, ru, ru, ru, ru, run
And take no prisoner
