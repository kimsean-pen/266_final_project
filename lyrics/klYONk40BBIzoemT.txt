Look down deep inside the crystal clear
water flowing 'round from your head
Looks like again this time
I'll have to back track
on what it was that I said
I would never ever compromise,
kiss the clouds of love,
or fall for someone like you
Now I find my eyes are open
and my ship is coming in
with my beautiful love aboard
Shining like Athena
in a silver suit of armor
Her love is like a nail
and now I'll bring down the hammer
Sprouting like a flower on a hill top
is where I'll find her
Where I'll plant a seed and watch it grow
into the streaming light of love.
