I remember way back, late night, throwback
Sitting on the front lawn talking
When I lost it, and oh, I lost it
I remember you were saying
You would come back, run back
Find me on the front porch like that
But you waited, so I got wasted

And I've always said
I'd never let myself hold on this long

'Cause people change overnight
Things get strange, but I'm alright
I'm still here, and I'm still high
And I'll still meet you in the middle of the night
But if you lie to me, lie to me
Lie to me
I'm gone

I still wonder if I called you, what would I do?
Leave a too-long voicemail that
I hate and then erase it
Like I planned it
And I wonder if I still lived in the city
Would I see you at a party
Take a big sip of my whiskey
And then leave quickly
And pray you missed me

And though I still know
Exactly how this ends
I keep holding on

'Cause people change overnight
Things get strange, but I'm alright
I'm still here, and I'm still high
And I'll still meet you in the
Middle of the night
You know, I'll meet you in the
Middle of the night
But if you lie to me
I'm gone

Oh, I feel it in me
Please forgive me
Leave this memory
Don't say you miss me
I know it's still in me
Please forgive me
Leave this memory
Don't say you miss me

'Cause people change overnight
Things get strange, but I'm alright
I'm still here, and I must still be high
'Cause I'll still meet you in the
Middle of the night
But if you lie to me, lie to me
Change overnight
Things get strange, but I'm alright
I'm still here, and I must still be high
But I'll still meet you in the middle of the night
Oh, if you meet me in the middle of the night
You know, I'll meet you in the middle of the night
But if you lie to me, lie to me
Then lie to me
I'm gone
