You might be a better friend
Still I can make it through What's left
Into the hallway, I wasn't afraid
Of my, my better days

And I'm not functioning that way
Slow down into some kid in the pray
Somebody out in the dark was a knock
when the door was unlocked

Twilight driving gotta watch out for the roos (australlian word)
Well, it's the early morning baby
I Said why don't you hit the snooze?
Twilight driving gotta watch out for the roos
Well, it's the early morning baby
I Said why don't you hit the snooze?

(2)
Pool and ocean isn't them
Feel your pockets full of them, deep friends
You know you've gotta be left
You gotta use 'em all up
It's what you said

I take two coffees for my breakfast
then I hunt for some real news
well is the early morning baby
and I only wanna be with you
