Hold tight, count to three,
Gotta stay close by me
And hold tight, sing and shout
Just ride my round-about
And hold tight, shut your eyes, girl,
You suit me for size.
Forget the other guys.
You'll never fall each time you call.
Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight.

Hold tight make me feel
What you say is for real
And hold tight, Carousel, girl,
You'll soon ring my bell
And hold tight, we will fly,
Swinging low, swinging high.
We're gonna make the sky.
You'll never fall each time you call.
Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight.

Hold tight, count to three,
Gotta stay close by me
And hold tight, sing and shout
Just ride my round-about
And hold tight, shut your eyes, girl,
You suit me for size.
Forget the other guys.
You'll never fall each time you call.
Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight.
