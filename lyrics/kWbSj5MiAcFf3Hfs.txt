Umm, umm, uum
I'm drivin' home tonight, catchin' all red lights
That's alright cause I don't want to be alone
There's nobody waitin' there, cold and empty bed
Words I wished I'd said come on the radio

Oou, ou, ou, and I don't know why I do this to myself
Oou, ou, ou, I know you're with someone else
But in my mind we're somewhere in my car
And it's rainin' hard on a streetlight glow.
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire

I never will forget, you grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring you back ho ho home

So, I've been sleepin' til noon in the same bedroom
Where I once held you and it's breakin' my heart
I should take down all those pictures from my wall
Promises we made won't fill this empty space

Oou, ou, ou, and I don't know why I just can't let you go. Ooh ooh ooh
Oou, ou, ou, I know you're never comin' back
But in my mind we're somewhere in my car
And it's rainin' hard on a streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
I never will forget, you grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back

Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring you back hoo hoo hoo, home
But in my mind we're somewhere in my car
And it's rainin' hard on a streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire

I never will forget, you grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring you back ho ho home

Ooh oh oh ooh
Mmm mm mm mm
(If I could bring you back)
Mmm
(I just close my eyes)
Mmm mmm
(I could hear you breathin' in)
Mm mm
(Keep slidin' down my back)
Mm mm
