Stricken with a horrible disease
Mankind falls victim to doom
Festering plague spreads across the earth
Rotting death... Morbid curse

Skin begins to rot
Deaden and peel away
Bones collapse
From advanced decay
Slow and painful death
No more blood to bleed
No end to the cadevers
Ridden with disease

Faces decomposing
Screaming in pain and despair
Becoming one with the earth
Flesh deteriorates until bones are bare

Skin begins to rot
Deaden and peel away
Bones collapse
From advanced decay
Slow and painful death
No more blood to bleed
No end to the cadevers
Ridden with disease
