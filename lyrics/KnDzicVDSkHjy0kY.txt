It' s so cold
In this room
And I'm trapped inside your heart
All by myself (yeah)
All alone
In your sea
And I' m sinking like a ship
I' m going down (going down)
I don' t wanna live my life without you
The hardest thing I ever do
Is try to pick myself up off the ground

Trying to outrun all the memories
But I keep falling down
I keep falling down
And it' s like you still got a hold on me
Cause I keep falling down

I keep falling down
I can' t sleep, I can' t dream
Cause you' re scents still here
On the pillows in my bed (you're in my bed)
And this pains so insane
I' m still haunted by the stupid things I've said
All the things I said
I don' t wanna live my life without you
The hardest thing I ever do

Is try to pick myself up off the ground
Trying to outrun all the memories

But I keep falling down
I keep falling down
And it' s like you still got a hold on me

Cause I keep falling down
I keep falling down
And how do I let go
I know I should move on
But without you I don' t know where I belong
And everywhere I go
Every happy face I see

It reminds me of the way it used to be
Oh, oh, oh
Trying to outrun all the memories
But I keep falling down
I keep falling down

And it's like you still got a hold on me
Cause I keep falling down
I keep falling down
Oh, oh, oh
I keep falling down
Oh, oh, oh
I keep falling down
Oh, oh, oh
I keep falling down
Oh, oh, oh
I keep falling down
