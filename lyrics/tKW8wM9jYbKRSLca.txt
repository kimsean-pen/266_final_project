每一个苹果
每一颗水滴
坠落到大地的怀抱里
每一枚火种
每一颗流星
燃尽在夜空的幕布里
So familiar
Every time I see your face
In the mirror
This is how we spend our days

This is real love, this is real love
And it's the way that I wanna be
This is real love, this is real love
And it's the way that I wanna feel

Love, love, love, love
(Chris Lee, Chris Lee)

So familiar
Every time I see your face
In the mirror
This is how we spend our days
说我爱你
说我爱你
用一颗透明的心灵
说我爱你
说我爱你
用一颗透明的心灵

Love, love, love, love
Love

So familiar
In the mirror
Love
