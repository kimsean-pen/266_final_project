I'm solid, not apparition, better check your vision
See what you're missing, boy
I don't need your permission to go on existing
With or without you, boy

I ain't gonna let it go
'Cause this been going too long

I won't be another ghost, no I won't be invisible
See me everywhere you go, no I won't be invisible

Invisible
Invisible

I had my suspicions, you kept me at a distance
I ain't disappearing, boy
I thought you were worth it, pulling back the curtain
I see why I was hurting, boy

And I ain't gonna let it go
Now you see me with the lights on (see me with the lights on)

I won't be another ghost, no I won't be invisible
See me everywhere you go, no I won't be invisible

Invisible
Invisible

I won't be diminished, eclipsed or hidden
You're gonna see my light blaze back to life, like a phoenix rise
I won't be diminished, eclipsed or hidden
You're gonna see my light blaze back to life, like a phoenix rise

Hey yeah! Invisible
Hey yeah! Invisible
Hey yeah! Invisible
