We are the ones you fear, breakers of your grand illusion
Exiled, dispossessed, your sown-seeds reaped and left abandoned
God-forsaken, left adrift, detritus ripped and torn asunder
Shunned like rodent hordes, human lives that wane and wander
You said, "Never again"
Does that keep your conscious clean?

We are disposable
The choir invisible
The last in line to join
The choir invisible

We flee, blight and filth, so far beyond your gates and walls
Nameless, namenlos, unknown, innominado, naught
Exiled, souls detested, so riven with abject despair
Blank stares, open mouths, our stifled screams you'll never hear
Toss the coin, we wait our turn until the boatman calls

We are disposable
The choir invisible
The last in line to join
The choir invisible
Down to the afterworld

Sinking, we slip into the black of our briny grave
We die, just another tick on your news feed
Wailing, such a mournful sound, underneath the waves
Dragged into the deep

We are disposable
The choir invisible
The last in line to join
The choir invisible

Down to the afterworld
