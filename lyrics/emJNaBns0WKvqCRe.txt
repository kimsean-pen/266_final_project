there just little pink plastic bags
blowing on a highway alone
they don't know where they'll go
they just gonna float out
hoh oh oho oh

there just little pink plastic bags
blowing on a highway alone
they don't know where they'll go
they just gonna float out
hoh oh oho oh

oh
what you gonna write(ride?)
what you want tonight
someone who'll go and get by (?)
they're just little pink plastic bags

blowing on a highway alone
they don't know where they'll go
they just gonna float out
hoh oh oho oh
they're just little pink plastic bags

blowing on a highway alone
they don't know where they'll go
they just gonna float out
hoh oh oho oh
