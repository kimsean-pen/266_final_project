Here we are, talkin' 'bout forever
Both know damn well, It's not easy together
We've both felt love, we've both felt pain
I'll take the sunshine over the rain

And I'll try
To love only you
And I'll try
My best to be true
Oh darling, I'll try

So I'm not scared, it's worth a chance to me
Take my hand, let's face eternity
Well, I can't tell you that I'll never change
But I can swear that in every way that

I'll try
To love only you
And I'll try
My best to be true
Oh darling, I'll try

I'm not perfect, just another man
But I will give you all that I am

And I'll try
To love only you
And I'll try
My best to be true
Oh darling, I'll try
