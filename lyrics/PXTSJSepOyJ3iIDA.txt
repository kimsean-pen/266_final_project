Post erratic tracks, now you're talking
I'll bet you drove all night, oh yeah
Just to show that you don't really care
And what you really could be
What you really could be

That's when we fell apart
Just some drops of water, feel a little lighter
It's running, across the field
Running, I'll keep running, towards the field, and
