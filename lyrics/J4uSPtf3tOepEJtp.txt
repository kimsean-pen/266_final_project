I'll go when I want to
Don't be surprised when I race you
Cause I wait and I know that I'll win
Better not play if you think you've been burned
I'll move cause I like you
I won't be denied if it don't feel good

Cause I feel, and I touch, and I live
Cause I feel, and I touch, and I live
Cause I feel, and I touch
Cause I feel, and I touch
Cause I feel, and I touch
Cause I feel, and I touch

So you got some premonitions all about my ways
Think you know some, but you know one
You're getting in my way
Always looking over my shoulder
But you'll never see what I'm about till it's over

I'll go when I want to
Don't be surprised when I race you
Cause I wait and I know and I'll run
Better not play if you think you've been burned
I'll move cause I like you
I won't be denied if it don't feel good

Cause I feel, and I touch, and I live
Cause I feel, and I touch, and I live
Cause I feel, and I touch
Cause I feel, and I touch
Cause I feel, and I touch
Cause I feel, and I touch

I wanna be a diver into the sea
Beyond my walk, going over me
A dangerous world, set me free
Oh I wanna be a climber in liquidity
The hardest world hanging over me
The fear of the cold, set me free
Set me free

I'll go when I want to
Don't be surprised when I race you
Cause I wait and I know and I'll run
Better not lay if you think you've been burned
I'll move cause I like you
I won't be denied if it don't feel good
Cause I feel, and I touch, and I live
Cause I feel, and I touch, and I live
Cause I feel, and I touch
Cause I feel, and I touch
Cause I feel, and I touch
Cause I feel, and I touch
