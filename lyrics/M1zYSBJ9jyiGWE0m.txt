The deception with tact
Just what are you trying to say
You've got a blank face, which irritates
Communicate, pull out your party piece
You see dimensions in two
State your case with black or white
But when one little cross leads to shots, grit your teeth
You run for cover so discreet
Why don't they do what they say, say what you mean oh baby
One thing leads to another

You tell me something wrong I know I listen too long but then
One thing leads to another
The impression that you sell
Passes in and out like a scent
But the long face that you see
Comes from living close to your fears

If this is up, then I'm up but you're running out of sight
You've seen your name on the walls
And when one little bump leads to shock miss a beat
You run for cover and there's heat
Why don't they do what they say, say what they mean
One thing leads to another
You tell me something wrong I know I listen too long but then
One thing leads to another - yeah yeah yeah
One thing (one thing) leads to another
Then it's easy to believe
Somebody's been lying to me

But when the wrong word goes in the right ear
I know you've been lying to me
It's getting rough, off the cuff I've got to say enough's enough
Bigger the harder, he falls
But when the wrong antidote is like a bulge on the throat
You run for cover in the heat
Why don't they do what they say, say what they mean

One thing leads to another
You tell me something wrong I know I listen too long but then
One thing leads to another - yeah yeah

One thing (one thing) leads to another
One thing (one thing) leads to another
