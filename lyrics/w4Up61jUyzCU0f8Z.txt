If all I have is now
No consequences, would I go touch the flame?
Or would I run for the exit?

I fought this on my life
The blood shined like never before
But I finally see your face
It's just a mirror looking back at me
And my reflection is all I see

I don't want to finish what we started
I've never should have let you in
You thought I was an easy target
Now I know you are
Who the devil is

You can try to take my salvation
You can try to take everything
I am not slave to your temptation
Cause I know who you are
Who the devil is

There's nowhere safe to hide
I can feel your presence
But we've been waging war
Since you fell from the Heavens

I've felt this every night
It feels like I've already been here before
When I'm looking into your eyes
My reflection is looking back at me
And the devil is all I see

I don't want to finish way we started
I've never should have let you in
You thought I was an easy target
Now I know you are
Who the devil is

You can try to take my salvation
You can try to take everything
I am not slave to your temptation
Cause I know who you are
Who the devil is

I've had enough of you
Cause you took enough away from me
The lies I lived became everything I believed
But the truth is the devil in you is me
The devil in you is me
The devil in you is me

I don't want to finish way we started
I've never should have let you in
You thought I was an easy target
Now I know you are
Who the devil is

You can try to take my salvation
You can try to take everything
I am not slave to your temptation
Cause I know who you are
Who the devil is
