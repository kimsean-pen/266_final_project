Time and time again
I stand at the crossroad.
Where the weight of my burden
eclipses - my resolve.

This broken path i've chosen
I walk it alone.
Though I feel forgotten
You've carved my name in stone.

In these desperate times
this I plead.
When all else fails remember me.

This is daily crucifixion
and these rusty nails leave scars.
My jagged crown is at my side.
Anguish is never far.

In these desperate times
this I plead.
When all else fails remember me.

This is a blood-oath.
They are nothing to me anymore.
But your voice means more to me
than you'll ever know.

There's no question
you're the answer.
I will find you.
In these desparate times
This I plead.
When all else fails remember me.
