Got a new face and it feels alright
Power and strength and appetite
I eat your loathing, hate, and fear
Should probably stay away from here

Hey look what's staring back at you
Caught reflecting in your eyes
Well I'm becoming something new
It's getting hard to recognize

New world
New times
Mutation
Feels alright

I tried a bit, then I tried some more
I left her on the bathroom floor
I think I knew when it crossed the line
I think I knew the whole goddamned time

Hey look what's staring back at you
Caught reflecting in your eyes
Well I'm becoming something new
It's getting hard to recognize

New world
New times
Mutation
Feels alright
