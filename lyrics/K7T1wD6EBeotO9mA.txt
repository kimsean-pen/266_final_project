I don\'t want to let you know your hearts an attraction
But I know what you\'re looking for
It\'s me you\'re waiting for
You\'re not allowed to live anymore

And a whole child ago I would sleep all day
Doing handstands on bottle banks
To prove that I\'m sane
And I\'m not fooling around

Looks like we made it
I can tell that she\'d been flying
Looks like we made it tonight

I\'m the second devil on your right or left with an eyeball
Melting out the corner of my mouth
The wings are bleeding
You\'re not supposed to fly anymore

And a whole child ago I would sleep all day
Doing handstands on bottle banks
To prove that I\'m sane
And I\'m not fooling around

Looks like we made it
I can tell that she\'d been flying
Looks like we made it tonight

Looks like we made it
I can tell that she\'d been flying
I saw her in the sky

Why don\'t you just ask her yourself
Why don\'t you just ask her yourself
Why don\'t you just ask her yourself
Why don\'t you just ask her yourself
Why don\'t you just ask her yourself
Why don\'t you just ask her yourself.
