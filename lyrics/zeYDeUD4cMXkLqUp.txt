Promise you will rescue me
If I bind you with my energy
It blinds you baby fast once seen
Comfort you in my disease

Standing there with outstretched arms
Vaccinated to my charms
Know that I will only wait

I saw you breathing as we woke
I felt the shape before it broke
I saw the future swallow all the love we've known
'Cause it's all just been one big joke

If we're going off your past
Nothing you can't build will last
A partial cleanse of bloody bath
Rolling in the aftermath

We should move before these hearts
(Defusing the love we're losing)
Ripen as the boredom starts
(Inside the sea of changes)
Clutching as the interest fades

I saw you breathing as we woke
I felt the shape before it broke
I saw the future swallow all the love we've known
'Cause it's all just been one big joke

Now we're giving it up, giving it up, giving it up
One big joke
Now we're giving it up, giving it up, giving it up
One big joke
Now we're giving it up, giving it up, giving it up
One big joke
Now we're giving it up, giving it up, giving it up

I saw you breathing as we woke
I felt the shape before it broke
I saw the future swallow all the love we've known
'Cause it's all just been one big joke

I saw you breathing as we woke
I felt the shape before it broke
I saw the future swallow all the love we've known
'Cause it's all just been one big joke

I saw you breathing as we woke
