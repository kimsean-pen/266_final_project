Your face, it shows you are an imposter
That snapshot still in the parking lot
You're on the screen, I feel you downtown
Out on the street, I feel the underground

The distance makes me want you more
The scent you give, that's what I'm waiting for
Your birthday song until your family learns
What are the things I planned, and that I'll be your man

Tonight I got your number
I even know your street
If you could only need me
I know we're meant to meet
And even if they find you
I know you make me feel
You make me feel more than real

They put you on, in the smoking glass
Your dress got torn straight through the underpass
The air got blue while in my closed-in room
I'm checking off what's left to do

The distance makes me want you more
The scent you give, that's what I'm waiting for
Your birthday song until your family learns
What are the things I planned, and that I'll be your man

Tonight I got your number
I even know your street
If you could only need me
I know we're meant to meet
And even if they find you
I know you make me feel
You make me feel more than real

Tonight I got your number
I even know your street
If you could only need me
I know we're meant to meet
And even if they find you
I know you make me feel
You make me feel more than real
