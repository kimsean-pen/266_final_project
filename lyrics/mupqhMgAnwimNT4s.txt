What happened to the homecoming king?
She thinks about him every September
Woke up from the American Dream
Needing another night to remember

One with magic under the mirror ball
Making memories and love in his car
No, she never wanted to take it slow
Sometimes thats just how the story goes

Don't give up when you're down
Don't look back on your life like it's over now
Sure, we're all gonna die, the time will come
And maybe the old days are gone
But the night is young

"What you drinking? Son have a seat,"
He said to me and ordered another
Woke up from the American Dream
Alone after the war he discovered

All the ticker tape and the glory fades
Life goes on and nothing gold ever stays
No, he never wanted to take it slow
Sometimes thats just how the story goes

Don't give up when you're down
Don't look back on your life like it's over now
Sure, we're all gonna die, the time will come
And maybe the old days are gone
But the night is young
Yeah, the night is young

Kings and queens and soldiers age
You can see the writing on their face;
Played the pawn in every game
Quintessential life it seems
When you're looking back at seventeen
Life is but a dream

Don't give up when you're down
Don't look back on your life like it's over now
Sure, we're all gonna die, the time will come
And maybe the old days are gone

Don't give up when you're down
Don't look back on your life like it's over now
Sure, we're all gonna die, the time will come
And maybe the old days are gone
But the night is young
Yeah the night is young, oh the night is young
Yeah the night is young
