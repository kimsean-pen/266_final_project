Friday, late night narratives
The soft touch of your hand
I wonder, could I taste a difference
Now I'm no longer in demand
And I don't see it clearly
Must've had too much
But I don't want it another way
See I must be losing touch

If you see me with another
I'm not the one losing my arms
Just remember not to bother
I'm never gonna let you down again
And if you catch me with another
And not the one that's been around
Whatever you may think of her
I could never let you down again
It's all about trust

Trapped on the back of the bus, suddenly feel alone
'Cause I might be up to something that you ought to know
Girl it's not our time or place anymore
You just should know I'm never gonna let you down again

Saturday, smooth injuries
We had it coming soon
I wonder, could I hear the difference
Now that you've changed a tune
I ran along so anyway
Or can we call it quits?
And is this what I need to take away
It's checkmate in my mind

If you see me with another
I'm not the one losing my arms
Just remember not to bother
I'm never gonna let you down again
And if you catch me with another
And not the one that's been around
Whatever you may think of her
I could never let you down again
It's all about trust

Trapped on the back of the bus suddenly feel alone
'Cause I might be up to something that you ought to know
Girl it's not our time or place anymore
You just should know I'm never gonna let you down again

You're on the other side
Now, want to let you know
Girl, you're on the other side
I'm never gonna let you down again
You're on the other side
Now, want to let you know
Girl, you're on the other side
I'm never gonna let you down again
It's all about trust

Trapped on the back of the bus suddenly feel alone
'Cause I might be up to something that you ought to know
Girl it's not our time or place anymore
You just should know I'm never gonna let you down again
