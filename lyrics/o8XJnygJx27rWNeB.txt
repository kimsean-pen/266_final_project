Remind myself, myself long ago
Fore drive, fore I could vote
All the time holding a grudge
Fore I knew people could die just because
Shaft in a sling, head for the bus
I knew what I liked was not very much
High at the time, tight to the grip
Always afraid of those normal American kids

Oh, all of my spirit leaked like a cut
I knew what I needed would never be enough
I was too high to change my bid
Always afraid to be a normal american kid

Always hating normal american empty summer days
Lightning crazed and cracked like an ache
High behind the garden shed
Painting myself as a normal American kid

I always hated it

High as high as high can loom
Under the sheets in my bedroom
I was high as high can get
Always afraid of those normal American kids

Oh, bongs and jams, and carpeted vans
Hate everything I don't understand
Hard times tightening the lid
I had to get away from those normal American kids
Always hated those normal American kids
Always hated those normal American kids
