Begging like, you might
Take order in your own hands.
I stare, seems like I don't care
Drop a chance in your hands, then

I know the bad's gotta fix itself
Correct over time
And I know
'Cuz I've got the cure
I've got a cure for your crimes

All I dreamed of
All that seemed like luck
Seems silly to you now
All I said to you
All I did for you
Seems so silly to me now

Screaming like
No one might
Call the cops and arrest you this time
Standing back
Against my building's back door
You're hoping for a ride

I know the world's been mean to you
I've got a cure, hold tight
I know the world's not fair to you
I've got a cure for its crimes

All I dreamed of
All that seemed like luck
Seems silly to you now
All I said to you
All I did for you
Seems so silly to me now

Oh, oh when you say it
So, so slowly to me
Oh, oh well I keep going
Oh, no I run while knowing
No, no I know you need it
So, so I need it too and
Oh, oh I must keep going
So, so you must too, and

Oh, oh when you say it
So, so slowly to me
Oh, oh well I keep going
Oh, no I run while knowing
No, no I know you need it
So, so I need it too
And oh, oh I must keep going
So you
Must too

Oh oh

I've got a cure
I've got the cure for you
I've got a cure

I've got the cure

(2x)
All I dreamed of
All that seemed like luck
Seems silly to you now
All I said to you
All I did for you
Seems so silly to me now

(2x)
I've got a cure
I've got the cure for you

Oh, Oh...
