I look at you, you bite your tongue
You don't know why or where I'm coming from
But in my head I'm close to you
We're in the rain still searching for the sun

You think that I wanna run and hide
I'll keep it all locked up inside, I just want you to find me

I'm not lost, I'm not lost, just undiscovered
We're never alone we're all the same as each other
You see the look that's on my face, you might think that I'm out of place
I'm not lost, no no, just undiscovered

Well, the time it takes to know someone
It all can change before you know it's gone, for it's gone
So close your eyes and feel the way
I'm with you now believe there's nothing wrong, nothing wrong

You think that I wanna run and hide
I'll keep it all locked up inside but I just want you to find me

I'm not lost, I'm not lost, just undiscovered
When we're never alone we're all the same as each other
You see the look that's on my face, you might think that I'm out of place
I'm not lost, no no, just undiscovered

I'm not running, oh, I'm not hiding
If you dig a little deeper you will find me

I'm not lost, not lost, undiscovered
When we're never alone we're all the same as each other
We're always the same
You see the look that's on my face, you might think that I'm out of place
I'm not lost, no no, undiscovered, sing it, sing it

I'm not lost, not lost, undiscovered
When we're never alone we're all the same as each other
You that we're all the same
You see the look that's on my face, you might think that I'm out of place
Well, I'm not lost, no, just undiscovered
