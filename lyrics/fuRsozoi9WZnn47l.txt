Oh dear, this whimsy, sulky fuzz
Abruptly you give up, you never care about me
Buzzzzzz... this is just irritating
Makes me wonder what I can do
Hey, sweetheart, what should I do now?
Now disconnected, we're just repeated by the echo
Hey, sweetheart, what should I do now?
Disconnected, every time, all the time
We're connected serially and
Sticking together, you know what I mean
The head of your plug can be a bit more teasing
"May come off... stay deep inside please"
Hey, sweetheart, what should I do now
With us, so badly disconnected
