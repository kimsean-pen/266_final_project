Looking for a candidate
You have an option, only one choice
Sipping my drinks, looking around
There's so much beauty, oh yes we can

But yet self-confidence is a fragile concept
That often fades away in the night
And there it comes, that unwanted guest
There is no place for you tonight

Want me to go, want me to go
'Cause you think I'm lying, 'cause you think I'm lying
No, open the door
'Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no

Like an evil satellite
Twisting the truth then leaving us alone
In this mad and moody world
Society without love

I state my heart has been well trained
I'm gonna be your candidate
I am the hunter and you are the prey
Tonight I'm gonna eat you up

Want me to go, want me to go
'Cause you think I'm lying, 'cause you think I'm lying
No, open the door
'Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars

I press my nose to the glass
It's raining outside, it's raining outside
I would like to storm in
Roar like a lion, roar like a lion

But I fear your judgement, oh I fear your judgement
I'm so wet, I'm dirty
But I fear your judgement, oh I fear your judgement
It's me and my imperfection

Want me to go, want me to go
'Cause you think I'm lying, 'cause you think I'm lying
No, open the door
'Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no

Want me to go
'Cause you think I'm lying, 'cause you think I'm lying
No, open the door
'Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no

Want me to go
'Cause you think I'm lying, 'cause you think I'm lying
No, open the door
'Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no
