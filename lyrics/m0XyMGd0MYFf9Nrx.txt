At slow speed
We all seem focused
In motion we seem wrong wrong
In summer we can taste the pain

I want you to be free
Don't worry about me
And just like the movies
We play out our last scene

Two can play at this game
We both want power
In winter we can taste the pain
In our short years

We come long way
To treat it bad and throw it
In our short years
We come long way

To treat it bad and throw it
I want you to be free
Don't worry about me
And just like the movies

We play out our last scene
You won't cry
I won't scream
In our short years we come long way

To treat it bad and throw it
And if we make a little space
A science fiction showcase
In our short film

A love disgrace
Dream a scene to bright face
In our short years
We come long way

To treat it bad
Just to throw it away
I want you to be free
Don't worry about me

And just like the movies
We play out our last scene
You won't cry
I won't scream
