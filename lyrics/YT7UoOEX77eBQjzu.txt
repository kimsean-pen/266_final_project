Fuck, don't tell me you're fine all the time
It'll get in my head a bad way, babe
Don't let it creep in your mind, you'll go blind that way
And that's a madness that breaks faith

They say the Kingdom of Heaven touched down
In an interstate motel lobby
True to the American WAY (the American WAY)
It's available only today
Americana's crusade for the common man's promised land

Kaboom
Blowout
Everything must go
Everything must go
Make way
for the Kingdom come
Blowout
Everything must go
Everything must go
Make way
for the revolution

They call that Holy War in Dallas
They send crusaders to reclaim the new Jerusalem
They say the Queen was born of malice
The Queen of Babylon and all her sons ascended to the throne

They cry for Holy War in Dallas
They send crusaders out from Phoenix to Beijing
They're calling "Purify the palace, the streets"
But the temple remains unclean
Yea, the temple remains unclean

I see it said in your eyes
all the time
You ain't gotta tell me you're fine babe
They call that Holy War in Dallas
They call for Holy War
on us
