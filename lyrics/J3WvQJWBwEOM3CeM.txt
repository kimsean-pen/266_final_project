The sun was golden flamed
The air was sweet like honey
The grass was soft we made
A pledge to keep on running
The clouds all shied away
The air was warm and damp
Oh on this golden day
You ripped my heart away

It was the dawn of may
A lonely blackbird singing
Now the same melody
Brings back the pain

(Bring back the pain)
You'll get it, regret it
Take my advice!
(Bring back the pain)
You'll get it, regret it
If you are wise!
As long as you are getting older
Always look over your shoulder twice

The moon was silver-lined
The air was sweet like honey
We've said our last goodbyes
Now what are we becoming?
Outside the blackbirds sing
But you keep down the blinds
'Cause each time you kiss her lips
They'll sing my lullaby

(Bring back the pain)
You'll get it, regret it
Take my advice!
(Bring back the pain)
You'll get it, regret it
If you are wise!
As long as you are getting older
Always look over your shoulder twice

Always look twice

Not so long ago
Now we are sober and cold
There's no way to return
We've got to let our bridges
Got to let our bridges burn

(Bring back the pain)
You'll get it, regret it
Take my advice!
(Bring back the pain)
You'll get it, regret it
If you are wise!
You'll get it, regret it
(Bring back the pain)
You'll get it, regret it
As long as you are getting older
Always look over your shoulder
Always look over your shoulder twice
