Lies, all I hear are lies
Have you ever spoke a word of truth in your life?
Misled, you've always been misled
Always is taking advice from people who claim to be your friends

Oh I should have never laid eyes on you
Now I'm tangled up what can I do
What can I do, what can I
What can I do

Try, now you need to try
Try to never make the same mistakes in your life twice
(make the same mistakes in your life twice)
Truth, all I want is truth
Turning away is the last move I expect from, expect from you

Oh I should have never laid eyes on you
Now I'm tangled up what can I do
Oh I should have never laid eyes on you
Now I'm tangled up what can I do
What can I do

When you set the perfect trap
What can I do
What can I do
What can I do now

(lies all I hear are lies)

Oh I should have never laid eyes on you
Now I'm tangled up what can I do
Oh I should have never laid eyes on you
Now I'm tangled up what can I do (what can I do)

what can I do
what can I (what can I do)
what can I do
