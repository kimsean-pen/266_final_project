ai si you ti reda
o yo tu si era
lo yo tu so lo la
dead boys don't cry
do yo tu si e dai
your murder lo desai
you see you do la ra
dead boys don't cry

As proud as we're dead, the werewolves are back
Countdown the strike and prepare for attack
Pray when we take your life on this side
And you know soon you'll be dying
Cold are your veins, and when you deny
Dark is the night and alone you will die

Break all the chains and wait for the time

When you return with the night
Dead boys don't cry
No wonder why
You'll see them ride the midnight sky
Dead boys don't cry
For they can't die

You'll see them light the grave goodbye
Dead boys don't cry

When we come near don't hide in your bed
One night in hell and you wake up undead
Dead when the day, alive in the night

Gone with the morning horizon
Don't you dare say, the damned you adore
When you decide you can't take any more

Phantoms we are, and lonesome we ride
Into the dark of the night
Dead boys don't cry
No wonder why
You'll see them ride the midnight sky
Dead boys don't cry
For they can't die
You'll see them light the grave goodbye
ai si you ti reda
o yo tu si era
lo yo tu so lo la
dead boys don't cry
Dead boys
Don't cry
Dead boys
Don't cry
Dead boys
Don't cry
Dead boys
Don't cry
Dead boys don't cry
