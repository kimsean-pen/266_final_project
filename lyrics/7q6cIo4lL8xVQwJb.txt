I told you what I said
But you never listen
We're stuck in the shadows
Lost in your difference

I lived everyday like it was all over
Stuck with the weight put on my shoulders
I was afraid to be myself

'Cause I can't change
I'll stay the same
'Cause I can't change
And that's okay

I feel the weight
And I feel the pain
Of being so different
Acting the same

I'm done with the burden of being so afraid
Biting my tongue, having to explain
Just leave me alone

'Cause I can't change
I'll stay the same
'Cause I can't change
And that's okay

Up all night
Down all day
Up all night

I don't know what to believe anymore
I don't know what to believe anymore

'Cause I can't change
I'll stay the same
'Cause I can't change
And that's okay
