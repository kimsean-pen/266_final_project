last night I told a stranger all about you
they smiled patienty with disbelief
I' always knew you would succeed
no matter what you tried
and I know you did it all
in spite of me

still I'm proud to have known you
for the short time that I did
proud to have been a step up on your way
proud to be a part of your illustrious career
and I know you did it all
in spite of me
in spite of me

late last night
I saw you in my living room
you seemed so close but yet so cool
for a long time I thought that you'd be coming back to me
those kind of thoughts can be so cruel
so cruel

and I know you did it all
in spite of me
in spite of me
