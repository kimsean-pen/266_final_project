Trying so hard to get by
To be the next big thing alive
But all the same
Every color I see, a pale shade of grey
Trying so hard and they say
You're just a signature away
Just one handshake
Well, here's to collars and suits
And things that they say

Once more it's your chance, just take it
Once more, don't be so blind
For all I care you fake it
It's your chance to shine

And it's all
All that I dream of
There's nothing I want more
There's nothing I would trade it for
All I dream of
It's all I really want
There's nothing I want more
There's nothing else
My problem if I can't take it

Why would we change our own game
These are the rules by which we play
I've heard it all before
Try to make up your mind
And make up your face
I don't believe in a way
To skip a chapter and be great
There's no such thing
Where all traumas and flaws are gently erased

Once more it's your chance, just take it
Once more, don't be so blind
For all I care you fake it
It's your chance to shine

And it's all
All that I dream of
There's nothing I want more
There's nothing I would trade it for
All I dream of
It's all I really want
There's nothing I want more
There's nothing else
My problem if I can't take it

Here's to the collars and suits
And the things they say
Gotta bring something better to the
Table to tempt me
Here's to the collars and suits
And the things they say
Better put your money where your mouth is

And it's all
All that I dream of
There's nothing I want more
There's nothing I would trade it for
All I dream of
It's all I really want
There's nothing I want more
There's nothing else
My problem if I can't take it

My mistake if I'm not taking it
All at stake if I'm not making it
My mistake if I'm not taking it
All at stake if I'm not making it
My mistake if I'm not taking it
All at stake if I'm not making it
My mistake if I'm not taking it
My problem if I can't take it
