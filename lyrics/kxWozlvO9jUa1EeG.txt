He's got a million dollar car
He's got a thirty-seven year old guitar
He's got a family who deals heroin,
you're on the edge of your chair and then
You feel it
He's looking at you
He's laughing at you
It's happening.

I can't, I can't believe it.
But it's here on the pages I'm reading
It's all I can do to conceal my feelings of jealousy. jealousy.

I know it's just a drawer of photographs
They're ex-girlfriends, I try to remember that
I don't wanna look, but I'm already hooked on jealousy. jealousy.

I can't believe you had a life before me
I can't believe they let you run around free
Just putting your body wherever it seemed like a good idea
What a good idea

Standing
On the corner
Watching
The ladies
Pass by
Imagining me behind your eyes
And then what did I see?
I saw hips, I saw thighs
I saw secret positions that we never try
I saw jealousy
I saw jealousy
I can't, I can't believe it
But it's here in this place and I see it
It's all I can do to conceal my feelings of jealousy. jealousy.

Standing
On the mud flats
Watching
The salmon
Die
Wonder if I'll ever bury the hatchet inside.
Imagining me behind your eyes
And then what did I see?
I saw hips, I saw thighs
I saw secret positions that we never try
I saw jealousy
I saw jealousy

I can't believe you had a life before me
I can't believe they let you run around free
Just putting your body wherever it seemed like a good idea
What a good idea
