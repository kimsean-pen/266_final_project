I waited by the phone like an idiot.
You never call me back like you say you will.
Were you lying when you said you were over it?
Have you ever told someone how you really feel?

You're an idiot.

I'm driving to your house like a hypocrite.
I thought that this could bring me some clarity,
but I'm just standing here looking desperate.
I hate the way you bring out the worst in me.

You're an idiot, just an idiot.
You're an idiot, such an idiot.

You said that it's not black and white
after she left with you that night.
I could have kept my heart in tact,
but I keep on coming back.

I respond at 3am like an idiot.
All this casual talk, what a gentleman.
You act like we're okay and I'm sick of it.
I wish I could hurt you back, fucking idiot.

You're an idiot, just an idiot.
You're an idiot, such an idiot.

You said that it's not black and white
after she left with you that night.
I could have kept my heart in tact,
but I keep on coming back.

Is it that obvious that I need to move on?
I can't believe it's so obvious
that I gave you all you want.
Now get out of my bed!

You said that it's not black and white
after she left with you that night.
I could have kept my heart in tact,
but I keep on coming back.

I know that it's not like it was,
but I'm still hanging on because
I just can't get you out my head.
Maybe I'm the idiot.

I'm the idiot!
