When I was
A little baby
A mamma's boy
No one could save me
From those kids at school

They would bully
They would tease
They would taunt me
Haunt me

You're such a pretty boy
You're such a pretty boy
You're such a pretty boy
You're such a pretty boy

Fear
I grew up so scared
The bible belt
Redneck lifestyle
One day I'll fly free

In the airplane
Where's my seat?
Where's my champagne?
Champagne

I'm such a pretty boy
I'm such a pretty boy
I'm such a pretty boy
I'm such a pretty boy

Heaven knows the lengths I go to please them every day
And they don't even notice when I'm
Down

Such a pretty boy
Such a pretty boy
Such a pretty boy
Such a pretty boy

Such a pretty boy
Such a pretty boy
Such a pretty boy
Such a pretty boy
Hotels were closed
And the airport was clean
He was stranded alone
In his southwest dream
Hotels were closed
And the airport was clean
I was stranded alone
In my southwest dream
