We've been to both Carolina's
Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down the coast a few times
Well I'm in Paris, paradise
But I ain't got much memory of the scenes come to think
I miss them all and everybody
It's all your fault

No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been

No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on... (with my eyes on you)
With my eyes on... (with my eyes on you)

Speaking of the coast, remember Fibre Beach
You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that noon that I can't recall
But God I saw
All I needed too
Might as well have stayed in the room

No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been

No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on... (with my eyes on you)
With my eyes on... (with my eyes on you)

Don't you remember Time Square
And people countin' down everywhere
2000-whatever, no I didn't care
Cause baby you were there
And once again
Couldn't help but stare

No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you

Halfway around the world
Or the local corner booth
Yeah you guessed it girl
You know I got my eyes on you
We could be on any street

Any party, any room
I'll be there all night with my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
