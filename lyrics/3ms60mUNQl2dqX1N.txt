Sweet drip
We get a little lifted
Need this
We never sleep for long
Stop me if I'm wrong

But I'm so out of sync
And you're out of sync with me

Get off on memories of
Things we did when we were young and evil
And I have a heart I want to put to use
Empathy, it never came so naturally 'til I met you

I know you heard that I'm a psycho
With a history of instability
Now I guess we'll see

I felt dead the whole year
But I'm living in hope and
I begin to forget

Things I did when I was young and evil
And I have a heart I want to put to use
Empathy, it never came so naturally
I know that I am gonna have to prove it you

Maybe there is really nothing wrong with me
Even though I acted reprehensibly
Find myself believing in the mystery
Can't believe the shit that we were promised
Really might exist
