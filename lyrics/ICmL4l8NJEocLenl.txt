Why you in so much hurry
is it really worth the worry
Look around, then slow down
What's it like inside the bubble?
Does your head every give you trouble?
It's no sin, trade it in
Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
from somewhere deep inside the inner man
Are you always in confusion
Surrounded by illusion, sort it out, you'll make out
Seem to make a good beginning, someone else ends up winning
Don't seem fair, don't you care
Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
from somewhere deep inside the inner man
Don't you forget who'll take care of you
It don't matter what you do
form a duet and let Him sing melody
You'll provide the harmony
Why you in so much hurry
is it really worth the worry
Look around, then slow down
What's it like inside the bubble?
Does your head every give you trouble?
It's no sin, trade it in
Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
from somewhere deep inside the inner man
Hang On
Help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
from somewhere deep inside the inner man
Help is on its way
Help in on its way
