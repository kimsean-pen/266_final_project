LICENSE TO CONFUSE
I'm not attractive today, I'm not a sight for sore eyes
I'm not an Adam or Eve, I'm just a nervous young thing
Hear my voice strain as I sing, my will won't bend and thenbreak
The crate will break and I'll fall, I couldn't help it at all
I've got a license to confuse, what do we got to lose?
A license to confuse
I guess I got what it takes to help me make this mistake
It took a while but I learned, it took a twist but I turned
And now its clear that I'm blind, another mountain to climb
Another distance to fall, I couldn't help it all
I've got a license to confuse, what have you got to lose?
A license to confuse
I shouldn't sound so forlorn, regret the day I was born
Cuz here I am and I've been, I only need a few friends
My hands are sweating all day like I've been letting me down
Like I've been letting me slide, just some nonsense on my mind
And the license to confuse, nothing I can use
Bust it, build it for a year
Here's my license that's my right
