She's the woman that's on your mind
She's a woman who takes her time
She's the woman that's on your mind
She's a woman who takes her time

Yes, I feel sweet emotion
Every time you're near me
Every time you are near

I said I feel sweet emotion
Every time you're near me
Every time you are near

So sweet

I said I feel sweet emotion
Every time you're near me
Every time you are near

And I feel like your creation
Every time you're near me
Every time you are near

'Cause she's the woman that's on my mind
She's the woman who takes my time
She's the woman that's on my mind
She's the woman that's on my mind

I said I feel sweet emotion
Every time you're near me
Every time you are near

And I feel sweet sensation
Every time you're near me
Every time you are near

And I feel vibrations
What are your expectations?
Baby, I don't have no fear

(Sweet emotions, I feel, sweet emotions, I feel)
'Cause she's the woman that's on my mind
(Sweet emotions, I feel, sweet emotions, I feel)
She's the woman who takes my time
(Sweet emotions, I feel, sweet emotions, I feel)
She's the woman that's on my mind
(Sweet emotions, I feel, sweet emotions, I feel)
She's the woman that's on my mind
(Sweet emotions)

Yes, I feel sweet emotion
Every time you're near me
Every time you are near

And I feel sweet sensation
Every time you're near me
Every time you are near

I said I feel sweet emotion
Every time you're near me
Every time you are near

Excuse me if I seem audacious
But you're just so flirtatious
I just need you here

She's the woman that's on your mind
