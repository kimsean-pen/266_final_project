Defective and invariable
We are untouched by it
Patrick runs a red light
And I am in the back seat
I am watching your mouth
In her rear view mirror
Pensive like a child
My parents' Blazer, 1996
Six months
And are you still afraid of my want?

Sun hot on my eyelids
I'm flinching but you pretend not to notice
I am reading Sam Pink in your bed
He says:
"Living another fifty years seems impossible"
Your eyes roll back
And I think of babies born
First scream into infinity
And I am tired

Heavy with sweat
When I pull you out of your sweater
Flinching with the awareness of a newborn
