Nothing but a heartache every day
(Nothing but a heartache)
Nothing but a tear drop all of the way
(Nothing but a tear drop)
Loving a bad guy is such a sin, yeah
He's got me all won,
Can I get him?

Nothing but a heartache every day
(Nothing but a heartache)
Nothing but a tear drop all of the way
(Nothing but a tear drop)
It is one situation that I just can't win, yeah
He's got me all won,
Can I get him?

I got a lot of those heartaches
I got a lot of those tear drops
Heartaches, tear drops, all of the way
Nothing but a heartache every day!

Nothing but a heartache every day
(Nothing but a heartache)
Nothing but a tear drop all of the way
(Nothing but a tear drop)
Him loving me is just too slim, yeah
He's got me all won,
Can I get him?

I got a lot of those heartaches
I got a lot of those tear drops
Heartaches, tear drops, all of the way
Nothing but a heartache every day!

Nothing but a heartache every day
(Nothing but a heartache)
Nothing but a tear drop all of the way
(Nothing but a tear drop)
Him loving me is just too slim, yeah
He's got me all won,
Can I get him?

Nothing but a heartache every day
(Nothing but a heartache)
Nothing but a tear drop all of the way
(Nothing but a tear drop)
Heartache, ooo I get 'em, ev'ry ev'ry day
(Nothing but a heartache)
Tears pouring all down my face
(Nothing but a tear drop)
Ooh, the man has got me, so uptight!
(Nothing but a heartache)
Nothin' I do, seem to, turn out right
(Fade)
