Your parents hide, they live in fear,
They're lying restless as the dawn gets near.
But you wanna live, you wanna try
You hear the whisper of the world outside.

So take a chance and leave tonight
Sarah's waiting in the car outside.
About the door your father wakes
You let your anger and your sadness break.

()
And when you turn around, he's laid down on the ground
And now you're standing with your finger on the pulse.
And then an open door, two footsteps on the floor
And now you're standing with your finger on the pulse.

It's Sarah's face, her worried eyes
Pulls back the door and gently steps inside.
The nighttime with a charcoal grin
The fuzzing diamonds on her pallid skin.

And when she turns around, he's laid down on the ground
And now you're standing with your finger on the pulse.
And then an open door, two footsteps on the floor
And now you're standing with your finger on the pulse.

(Bridge)
If I don't belong by you
I don't belong anywhere.
You know I'd follow you
To the heart of nowhere.
It's just too kinds of á¹—eople
God fearing and the godless, cowards and the faithless
And I would stand by you.
