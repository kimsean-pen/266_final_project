She leads a lonely life
She leads a lonely life

When she woke up late
In the morning light
And the day had just begun

She opened up
Her eyes and thought
Oh, what a morning.

It's not a day for work,
It's a day for catching tan
Just laying on the beach
And having fun
she's going to get you.

All that she wants
Is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy...
All that she wants
Is another baby, yeah.

All that she wants
Is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy...
All that she wants
Is another baby, yeah.

All that she wants...
All that she wants.

So if you are in sight
And the day is right
She's a hunter, you're the fox...

The gentle voice
That talks to you
Won't talk forever.

It's a night for passion
But the morning
Means goodbye...

Beware of what is flashing
In her eyes
She's going to get you.

All that she wants
Is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy...
All that she wants
Is another baby, yeah.

All that she wants
Is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy...
All that she wants
Is another baby, yeah.

All that she wants
Is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy...
All that she wants
Is another baby, yeah.

All that she wants
Is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy...
All that she wants
Is another baby, yeah.

All that she wants...
All that she wants.
