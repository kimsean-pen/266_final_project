There used to be nothing, nothing but boys
Some unchained distortion, that truly annoyed
And this old sequence, of infrequent sounds
In my existence, kept running around

Then you arrived right out of the blue
but then you arrived right out of the blue

Do you remember the day
(I remember)
When we started to crossfade
(when we started to crossfade)
Our melodies lay
(when we started to crossfade)
Harmonious soundscapes
(into each other)
Do you remember the day
(I remember)
When we started to crossfade
(when we started to crossfade)
Our melodies lay
(our melodies lay)
Harmonious soundscapes
(into each other)

Submerging soundbites of whimsical ahhh
Submerging soundbites of whimsical sights
Climatically climbing to unexplored heights
Like synchronized heartbeats humming in sync
Mexican crickets are rubbing their wings

Do you remember the day
(I remember)
When we started to crossfade
(when we started to crossfade)
Our melodies lay
(when we started to crossfade)
Harmonious soundscapes
(into each other)
Do you remember the day
(I remember)
When we started to crossfade
(when we started to crossfade)
Our melodies lay
(our melodies lay)
Harmonious soundscapes
(into each other)

I remember, I remember
when we started to crossfade
When we started to crossfade, into each other
I remember when we started to crossfade
Our melodies lay, into each other
