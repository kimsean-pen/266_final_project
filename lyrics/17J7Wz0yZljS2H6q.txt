Let's go

I am not your Senorita
I am not from your tribe
In the garden, in the garden I did no crime

I am not your Senorita
I am not from your tribe
If you want inside of her, well
Boy you better make her a raspberry swirl

Things are getting de-desperate
When all the boys can't be men
Everybody knows I'm her friend
Everybody knows I'm her man

Things are getting de-desperate
When all the boys can't be men
Everybody knows I'm her friend
Everybody knows I'm her man

Let's go

I am not your Senorita
I don't aim so high
In my heart, in my heart I did no crime
If you want inside her, well
Boy you better make her a raspberry swirl

Raspberry swirl
Let's go
Raspberry swirl

Things are getting de-desperate
When all the boys can't be men
Everybody knows I'm her friend
Everybody knows I'm her man

Things are getting de-desperate
When all the boys can't be men
Everybody knows I'm her friend
Everybody knows I'm her man

Things are getting de-desperate
When all the boys can't be men
Everybody knows I'm her friend
Everybody knows I'm her man

Raspberry swirl
Let's go
Raspberry swirl
