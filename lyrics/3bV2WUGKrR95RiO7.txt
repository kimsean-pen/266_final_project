There, there it is
I swear he's gonna murder that poor kid
Wait, I hear it again
Don't turn on the lights until we
Hear the way it ends

Under Peruvian skies
Vanessa regretfully waits
The story unfolds in her eyes
Where midnight hysteria's no big surprise
Battered and bruised
Always confusing the love that she's losing for hate
Poor Vanessa
Poor, poor Vanessa

Hey, I hope you know
I'm taking all this with me when I go
Shame, you're not to blame
I'm the monster you created in your daddy's name

Under Peruvian skies
Vanessa regretfully waits
The story unfolds in her eyes
Where midnight hysteria's no big surprise
Battered and bruised
Always confusing the love that she's losing for hate
Poor Vanessa
Poor Vanessa

Terror by night
Liar by day
Telling her secrets won't take them away

Under Peruvian skies
Vanessa regretfully waits
The story unfolds in her eyes
Where midnight hysteria's no big surprise
Battered and bruised
Always confusing the love that she's losing for hate
Poor Vanessa
