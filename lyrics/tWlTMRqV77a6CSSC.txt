Light up the way of your heart
Move me like you do the mountains
Move me like you do the wind
And I'll chase your voice through the dark
Fix my eyes on the unexpected
In the wonder of your shadow-step
So take another step

You met me at the sinners' table
I found you waiting by the well, unexpected
You are always there
Tracing all my steps

Light up the way of your heart
Move me like you do the mountains
Move me like you do the wind
And I'll chase your voice through the dark
Fix my eyes on the unexpected
In the wonder of your shadow-step
So take another step

You never left the lost forsaken
Your mercy paves the road ahead, unexpected
You are always good
You are always good

Light up the way of your heart
Move me like you do the mountains
Move me like you do the wind
And I'll chase your voice through the dark
Fix my eyes on the unexpected
In the wonder of your shadow-step
And I won't be afraid
In every way, you never fail
So have your way, here God
And I'll sing your praise
Fix my heart to yours
Ready for the unexpected
Ready for what you will do next

I can't explain your heart
Or dare to trace-out all you are
But when I think about the road you took for love
I know your grace will stay the path

Light up the way of your heart
Move me like you do the mountains
Move me like you do the wind
And I'll chase your voice through the dark
Fix my eyes on the unexpected
In the wonder of Your shadow-step
And I won't be afraid
In every way, You never fail
So have your way, here God
And I'll sing your praise
Fix my heart to yours
Ready for the unexpected
Ready for what you will do next...

So take another step
