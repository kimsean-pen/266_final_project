They just don't make that kind of license anymore
That way of life anymore
That type of world anymore
What you done
Get out of my dreams you scum
They weren't meant for anyone
They weren't meant for anyone but me
In my cinematic mind
I see battles fought at sea
I awake in dawn's empire
It must be lonely being you being me
What you done
Get out of my dreams you scum
They weren't meant for anyone but me
What you done
I just get so over-run
Impossible dreams they come for me
For me
It's for the worlds they never see
This beatific revelry
By windswept kisses heavens rave
Lovers rise and fall and fall and rise again
What you done
Get out of my dreams you scum
They weren't meant for anyone but me
What you done
I just get so over-run
These unthoughtful dreams they come for me
What you done
Get out of my dreams you scum
They weren't meant for anyone but me
But me
