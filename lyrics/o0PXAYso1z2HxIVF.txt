My tribute

It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have shown me
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have made me
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have shown me
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have made me
Here's my tribute

15, I had known to be
So confused, broken easily
Now I could not be off the memory but you're next to me

18, you made me see
You lit the lights I've been dampening
Now I could not be off the memory but you're next to me

My passion was abused, my words were never used
But now I hope that you can see

That it's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have shown me and what you do
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have made me, look how I grew
Here's my tribute

23, now I'm taken in
This vicious whirl I was captured in
Now I could not be off the memory but you're next to me

My passion was abused, my words were never used
But now I hope that you can see

That it's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have shown me and what you do
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have made me, look how I grew
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have shown me and what you do
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have made me, look how I grew
Here's my tribute

It's my tribute!
My tribute! Oh no!

This life I've been brought
Life I've been leading
It's my life, it's my tribute

This life I've been brought
Life I've been leading
It's my life, it's my tribute

And it's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have shown me and what you do

It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have shown me and what you do
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have made me, look how I grew
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have shown me and what you do
It's all for you, it's all for you
For what you have made me, look how I grew
Here's my tribute
