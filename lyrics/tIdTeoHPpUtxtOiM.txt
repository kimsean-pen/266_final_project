In a world so grey
I watched the color fade into another kind of blue
It was one of my moods
In a world so pure
You owned the boundary where I stand and where I cant ignore

Come through the door
So now you wrote the book on how to change
See I turned the page, words stayed the same
how they remained

So I stepped aside
I watched the power slide out from underneath your arms
You were telling me lies
So I start to say
I had a feeling I would be the one to ride that train so far away

So you wrote the book on how to change
See I turned the page, words stayed the same
Time will shake you up, you rearrange
So show me how to make that clean escape

And darkness never fades
You never come to me
Oh remembering the daylight
Always in Fantasy

Only when you feel like messing with my dreams
Only when you feel like messing with my dreams
Its only when you feel like messing with my dreams
Its only when you feel like messing with me
