You and I,
we're two of a kind,
I hate to say it but you'll never relate,
what makes you tick?
It makes me smile.
You said that I should get away from it all,
and bury my head in the sand if I want to,
I think you'
should thank me now.
You were lying wide awake in the garden,
trying to get over your stardom,
and I could never see you depart us
and you're my baby,
you're just another girl.
I never mind the way I had to see ya,
my working on a day should never explains why I see you
and I feel your pain.
I love to wear my work inside of my head,
I can't complain but you should never react the way you did,
I feel your time.
You were lying wide awake in the garden,
trying to get over your stardom,
and I could never see you depart us
and you're my baby'
And you were lying wide awake in the garden,
trying to get over your stardom,
and I could never see you depart us
and you're my baby,
you're just another girl,
just another girl.
