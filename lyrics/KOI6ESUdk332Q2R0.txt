Can you leave me here alone now?
I don't wanna hear you say
That you know me
That I should be always doing what you say
'Cause I'm trying to get through today
And there's one thing I know

I don't wanna think about you
Or think about me
Don't wanna figure this out
I don't wanna think about you
Or think about nothing
Don't wanna talk this one out
I won't let you bring me down
'Cause I know, I don't wanna think about you
I don't wanna think about you

When I wake up here tomorrow
Things will never be the same
'Cause I won't wait
'Cause you won't change
And you'll always be this way
Now I'm going to get through today
And there's one thing I know

I don't wanna think about you
Or think about me
Don't wanna figure this out
I don't wanna think about you
Or think about nothing
Don't wanna talk this one out
This time I won't let you bring me down
Won't let you shut me out
This time I know, I don't wanna think about you

Run away, run away, I'm running as fast as I can
Run away, run away, I'll never come back again
Run away, run away

I don't wanna think about you
Or think about me
Don't wanna figure this out
I don't wanna think about you
Or think about me
Don't wanna talk this one out

I don't wanna think about you
Or think about me
Don't wanna figure this out
I don't wanna think about you
Or think about nothing
Don't wanna talk this one out
This time I won't let you bring me down
Won't let you shut me out
This time I know, I don't wanna think about you

Run away, run away, I don't wanna think about you
Run away, run away, I don't wanna think about you
Run away, run away, I don't wanna think about you
Run away, run away
