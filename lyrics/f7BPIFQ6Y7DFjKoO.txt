Like a flower that cannot bloom
Or the snow that falls in June
You're a thirst that's never quenched
When the storm has blown over we'll start again
Like a wound that never heals
Or the sorrow you can't conceal
You're the actor that won't pretend
When the storm has blown over we'll start again
Don't be so numb
Your time will come
So pick it up from where you left
Carry on
It's enough to be strong
If we both
Weather the storm
Like a star that never dies
Or a broken lullaby
I can see you need a friend
When the storm has blown over we'll start again
