Little man, I'm endlessly proud of you
In such a short time span
You've filled my heart with song
As I grow older, you grow wiser
Watching my mistakes
Memorise where I've gone wrong

If they fall way
I'll stay with you
But do as I say and not as do
Trust me, you'll see
All I want is what is best for you

Little man, your head is full of dreams
If only I could spend one day
Touring your imagination
As I live longer, you'll grow faster
At recognising the traps
That cause me such frustration

If they fall way
I'll stay with you
But do as I say and not as I do
Trust me, you'll see
All I want is what is best for you

If they fall way
I'll stay with you
But do as I say and not as I do
Trust me, you'll see
All I want is what is best for you

So naive, it helps me to breathe
Your smile I keep on file
You tickle me pink
I love the way you think
So when I'm feeling low I know
Little man, little man
I'm your greatest fan
