I'm a stupid whore
And a frigid b*tch
Now can you make up your mind
And tell me which is which
Oh, now I get it
You think I'm ugly
Yeah, tell your friends
How you never woulda done me

You're tryna tell me sexism doesn't exist?
If it doesn't exist, then what the f*ck is this?
How many boys will it destroy?
How many girls and boys will it annoy?

Take a good look
And get your bits out
I know you may have heard my exploitation
But this is what we call "the male rejection"

I'm at my friends party
He's asking for my number
"I'm sorry, I've got a boyfriend"
"B*tch, it was that a joke, aren't you a lesbian?"

You're tryna tell me sexism doesn't exist?
If it doesn' exist, then what the f*ck is this?
How many boys will it destroy?
How many girls and boys will it annoy?

Take a good look
And get your bits out
I know you may have heard my exploitation
But this is what we call "the male rejection"

I'm looking for a magazine
The ones with bands with real cool fans
But the music magazines with the real cool rapper
Is in the metal section in the magazines for men stand

You're tryna tell me sexism doesn't exist?
If it doesn' exist, then what the f*ck is this?
How many boys will it destroy?
How many girls and boys will it annoy?

Take a good look
And get your bits out
I know you may have heard my exploitation
But this is what we call "the male rejection"

He asked you to undress
But you didn't feel okay with it
He said you were dressed like a little slut
Said you were asking for that f*ck
But I'll tell you what happened
He abused your trust
Told all his friends about it
And now you feel the trust is cut

You're tryna tell me sexism doesn't exist?
If it doesn't exist, then what the f*ck is this?
How many boys will it destroy?
How many girls and boys will it annoy?

Female castration
Go live demonstration!
Domestic violence racist homophobic
Let's make a whole list

Well, girls and boys they stick together
They try to keep us quiet
But we won't stop, make it happen
No they can't shut us up
Uh!
Wooo!
Ugh!
