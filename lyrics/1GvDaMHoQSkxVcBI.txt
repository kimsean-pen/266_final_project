I guess I'm messy, I'm messy, I'm messy
I'm all messed up
I'm messy, I'm messy
I'm all messed up
I'm messy, I'm messy
I'm all messed up
I'm messy as a boy and I don't give a fuck

Walk into the room with my skirt tucked into my shoes
I skated here, I'm sweating, had a good day how about you?
Let's talk about these dang they stand way talking way over me
Chatting shit, I'm not a kid, well this is patronising
Then explain how you studied this at Uni so you'd know
More than me about the thing that paid for my phone
Why don't you make it a hat trick and comment on my look?

I don't know who you think I am
But your bitch is not one
I'm good at what I do
And don't ever let anyone
Tell me that your song's okay
But sweetie did you know
A couple changes here and there would make it super cool
(It would be so awesome, like so much better)

They say I'm a hot mess
I don't care what they say
They say I'm a hot mess
Cause I know what I'm doing
Guess I'm just a hot mess
Cause I say what I like and what I hate
Hot mess
Everyday, everyday
They say I'm a hot mess
I don't care what they say
They say I'm a hot mess
Cause I know what I'm doing
Guess I'm just a hot mess
Cause I say what I like and what I hate
Hot mess
Everyday, everyday, everyday

I guess I'm messy, I'm messy, I'm messy
I'm all messed up
I'm messy, I'm messy
I'm all messed up
I'm messy, I'm messy
I'm all messed up
I'm messy as a boy
And I don't give a fuck

Don't you think she'd look a little bit nicer
If she combed her hair every once in a while
Look at those jeans, so messy, jeez
You know what
Her natural hair color would look so much better on her with her bone structure
She probably doesn't even write her own songs

Open up my mouth and rap some fiction prose bro
But all that you can focus on is my makeup and clothes
I don't have perfect skin, I don't live in fairytale land
Stop telling me to grown some balls, I'm happy as a woman

Also on that subject, maybe you should change your look
Your presentation's roughy and it's time you really took
This whole thing seriously, do you really want success?
Just cause I'm a girl I think that you think you know the best
(Well let's be honest, I do)

They say I'm a hot mess
I don't care what they say
They say I'm a hot mess
Cause I know what I'm doing
Guess I'm just a hot mess
Cause I say what I like and what I hate
Hot mess
Everyday, everyday

They say I'm a hot mess
I don't care what they say
They say I'm a hot mess
Cause I know what I'm doing
Guess I'm just a hot mess
Cause I say what I like and what I hate
Hot mess
Everyday, everyday, they say

I'm so stupid please tell me
How the world works, I'm female you see
Please stop using such big words
My brain can't take it
I'm just a little GIRLI

They say I'm a hot mess
I don't care what they say
They say I'm a hot mess
Cause I know what I'm doing
Guess I'm just a hot mess
Cause I say what I like and what I hate
Hot mess
Everyday, everyday

They say I'm a hot mess
I don't care what they say
They say I'm a hot mess
Cause I know what I'm doing
Guess I'm just a hot mess
Cause I say what I like and what I hate
Hot mess
Everyday, everyday

They say I'm a hot mess
I don't care what they say
They say I'm a hot mess
Cause I know what I'm doing
Guess I'm just a hot mess
Cause I say what I like and what I hate
Hot mess
Everyday, everyday, everyday

I guess I'm messy, I'm messy, I'm messy
I'm all messed up
I'm messy as a boy and I don't give a fuck (messy)
