Whenever I hear goodbyes
Remind me baby of you
I break down and cry
Next time I'll be true, yeah
Fever for lost romance
Remind me baby of you
I took a crazy chance
Next time I'll be true
I'll be true
I'll be true

Footsteps on the dance floor
Remind me baby of you

Teardrops in my eyes
Next time I'll be true, yeah

Whispers in the powder room

She cries on every tune
Every tune
Every tune

And the music
Don't feel like it did
When I felt it with you

Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like
I felt it with you

That I do or feel ever feels

When I'm dancin' around
Remind me baby of you
I really let you down
Next time I'll be true, yeah
I took a crazy chance
She cries on every tune
Every tune
Every tune

Footsteps on the dance floor
Remind me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes
Next time I'll be true, yeah
Whispers in the powder room
She cries on every tune
Every tune
Every tune

And the music
Don't feel like it did
When I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like
I felt it with you

Hurting deep inside
She cries on every tune
I break down and cry
She cries on every tune
Every tune
Every tune

Footsteps on the dance floor
Remind me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes
Next time I'll be true, yeah
Whispers in the powder room
She cries on every tune

She cries on every tune
Every tune
Every tune

And the music
Don't feel like it did
When I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like
I felt it with you

And the music
Don't feel like it did
When I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like
I felt it with you

And the music
Don't feel like it did
When I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like
I felt it with you

And the music
Don't feel like it did
When I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like
I felt it with you

And the music
Don't feel like it did
When I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like
I felt it with you
I felt it with you
I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like
I felt it with you
I felt it with you
I felt it with you

Woh ooh oh ooh
Woh ooh oh ooh
Woh ooh oh ooh
