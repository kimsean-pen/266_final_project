She forced a smile
Said, boy come kiss my mouth
You know that hope you're holding to
It looks an awful lot like fear
Now you're so quick to fall on failure
And so quick to raise your voice
Like, if I can't find a mistake to blame
We didn't have a choice
Oh, but you had an option
I was your chance to feel complete
But when I leaned in close to you
You kissed your fear instead of me

You had my hand in your hand
You had my lip in your teeth
You had my heart on your sleeve
You had a chance to breathe
But boy, you wouldn't let your fear recede
So I moved on
Oh, and it's too late to change your mind
Now you got scared, boy, and I got gone
Now you failed and there's no way to turn back time
You had your chance
Boy, I tried

You tried
I looked her in the eye and smiled
My girl, you must understand that fear is not some product that I made
It crept unwelcome in my head
The day they had her torn away
It changed me

Now at the end of every day I lie awake at night and wait to feel
The wires of my brain get cut and quietly rearranged
And hear my beaten heart exclaim
Still I refuse to let her go
So we escape to our mistakes
For they wait patiently for us
Oh, how they always wait for me
If my fear has kept me here
Only my fear can set me free
And I'm sorry dear
But don't you dare speak another word
How could I risk holding your heart in me
While still in love with her
