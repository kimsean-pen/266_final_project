I'm not that plain and simple, I mean another lane
I'm rocking Shirley Temple, the cherry on the cake
Just a throwback kid from the nineties
I start my ABC's with the YZ
I paint with different colors and never in the lines
There isn't any other, I am the prototype
Tick tock, waste time with your rumors
But I'm so ice cold, good humor

They say I'm outta my mind
Standing on the outside
It's cooler, it's fresher
I like to hear 'em

They all gonna say what they wanna say anyway
Might as well give 'em something
Might as well give 'em something to talk about
I don't really care if they wanna stare, look at me
Might as well give 'em something
Might as well give 'em something to talk about

Give 'em something, a little something
A, a little something to talk about
Give 'em something, a little something
A, a little something to talk about

I don't believe in Yeezus, I like 'em Kanye West
I'm rocking dirty sneakers with my designer dress
Order a grade A steak with my pommes frites
I wake you up, Starbucks, sleep on me

They say I'm outta my mind
Standing on the outside
It's cooler, it's fresher
I like to hear it

They all gonna say what they wanna say anyway
Might as well give 'em something
Might as well give 'em something to talk about
I don't really care if they wanna stare, look at me
Might as well give 'em something
Might as well give 'em something to talk about

Give 'em something, a little something
A, a little something to talk about
Give 'em something, a little something
A, a little something to talk about

No, you don't know what
What you talking 'bout
No, you don't know me
So just shut your mouth
No, you don't know what
What you talking 'bout
No, you don't know me
So just shut your

They all gonna say what they wanna say anyway
Might as well give 'em something
Might as well give 'em something to talk about
I don't really care if they wanna stare, look at me
Might as well give 'em something
Might as well give 'em something to talk about

Give 'em something, a little something
A, a little something to talk about
Give 'em something, a little something
A, a little something to talk about
