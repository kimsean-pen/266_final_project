I'm overdue
Feeling the first kiss, taste of the first bliss
It's always new
Always just a fling, never the real thing

Maybe it's true
Maybe it's nothing
Maybe it's something
What I'm going through
Who's gonna love me right

Who's gonna save me tonight, night, night
Who's gonna save me tonight, night, night
Who's gonna save me tonight, night, night
'Cause I'm tired of waiting, so who's gonna save me tonight

And I'm tired of waiting, so who's gonna save me tonight

This crowded room
Lost in the glances, a million chances
I don't know what I'm looking for
But whatever it is, it's the cure

Maybe it's true
Maybe it's nothing
Maybe it's something
What I'm going through
Who's gonna love me right

Who's gonna save me tonight, night, night
Who's gonna save me tonight, night, night
Who's gonna save me tonight, night, night
'Cause I'm tired of waiting, so who's gonna save me tonight

Who's gonna save me
Who's gonna save me
Who's gonna save me
Who's gonna save me tonight
Who's gonna save me
Who's gonna save me
'Cause I'm tired of waiting, so who's gonna save me tonight

Who's gonna save me tonight, night, night
Who's gonna save me tonight, night, night
Who's gonna save me tonight, night, night
'Cause I'm tired of waiting, so who's gonna save me tonight
