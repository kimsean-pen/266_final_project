Intimidation - you cannot take much more
No compromise - this time it's war

Take none alive - their battle cry roars
Nowhere to hide - this time it's war

Face the fear that grips your mind
The final conflict - the end of mankind

Read the hatred deep within their eyes
It's your time to die you now realize

What has occurred to man
Just isn't how you planned
Enslaved by machinery
Submit to technology

Our future lives - Mankind's entity
Lies in our hands - Together we must face reality

A ruined world of lost identity
Technological supremacy
