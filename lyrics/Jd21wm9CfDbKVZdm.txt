Well, I'll wait till you listen
I won't say a word to follow your instincts
Which just never worked for me
Oh, you're silent but strong
Yeah, I'm playing that card
And you're noticing nothing again
Now I'm lying on the table with everything you said

Keep that in mind, the way that it felt
When the most I could do was to just blame myself
(Feel it out for once and feel nothing like everyone else)
When the most I could do was to just blame myself
And I know you know everything
I know you didn't mean it
I know you didn't mean it

I know you know everything
(Drop everything)
(Start it all over)
I know you didn't mean it
(Remember more than you'd like to forget)
I know you didn't mean it
So, we're talking forever and you almost feel better

But, better's no excuse for tonight
You see, it's never bad enough to just leave or give up
But, it's never good enough to feel right
Now I'm lying on the table with everything you said
It will all catch up eventually
Well, it caught up and honestly

The weight of my decisions were impossible to hold
But they were never yours, they were never yours
(They were never yours)
Well, I know you know everything
I know you didn't mean it
I know you didn't mean it
I know you know everything
(Drop everything)

(Start it all over)

I know you didn't mean it
(Remember more than you'd like to forget)
I know you didn't mean it
Drop everything

Start it all over
Remember more than you'd like to forget
Drop everything
Start it all over
Remember more than you'd like to forget
Would you like to forget?
Would you like to forget?

Drop everything, start it all over

Well, drop everything, start it all over
(Would you like to forget)
Drop everything, start it all over
Start it all
Well, I know you know everything
I know you didn't mean it
I know you didn't mean it
I know you know everything
(Drop everything)
(Start it all over)
I know you didn't mean it
(Remember more than you'd like to forget)
I know you didn't mean it
I know you know
I know you know
I know you know
(Drop everything)
(Start it all over)
I know you know
(Remember more than you'd like to forget)
You know, you know, you know
