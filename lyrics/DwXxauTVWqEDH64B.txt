Found with a hand in the pot.
Palms full.
Everything got.
Gold skin on a summer's eve.
Shed tees and white teeth.
I'll take what I want.
I'll concede to all my faults.
Dirty jeans and tongues pretend to talk.
I won't feel guilty when you kiss me.
Love is malleable and it bends like a body.
Legs wrapped around me.
The Gated Garden is a myth I can't conceive.
And I know where I'll sleep.
Honey pot.
I'll take what I want.
I want.
