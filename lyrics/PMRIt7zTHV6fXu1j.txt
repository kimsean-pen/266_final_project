When the days are long
And it feels so easy to fall apart
Do you fall apart?
Or will you say that everything's fine
For the rest of your life?
Everything's fine

In the dark, everything is soft
Grab your clothes, take them off
And run the bath with the thought
"This is where I belong"

And you wash away the pain
You wash away the flakes of skin
You wash away the pain
Of everyone and everything you are
But you are the most important part
The most important part
