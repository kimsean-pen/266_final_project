Coco believe me, I'm a lonesome man
I wanna get stoned and trip some wires
I wanna get myself underground
I said that you must believe me
When I say I'm fightin' the dead
Lyin' low across the evening
Can you see the lumps on my head?
But I got these voices that just keep singin' out
Sayin'

I just can't stop losing control"
I said that I just can't stop losing control
I just can't stop losing control
I said that I just can't stop losing control

Trench wander pavement
Tryin' to score some love
In the corner of the city
Matching faces with fees
I guess that you never been here by the look upon your face
Standing with all the whores and cannibals
In the censored race
But I got these voices that just keep singin' out
Sayin',

I just can't stop losing control"
I said that I just can't stop losing control
I just can't stop losing control
I said that I just can't stop losing control

You must believe me
When I say I'm fightin' the dead
Lyin' low across the evening
Can you see the lumps on my head?
I guess that you never been here by the look upon your face
Standing with all the whores and cannibals
In the censored race
But I got these voices that just keep singin' out
Sayin'

I just can't stop losing control"
I said that I just can't stop losing control
I just can't stop losing control
I said that, I just can't stop losing control

Well I got, I got these voices
