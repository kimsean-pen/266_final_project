There's no need to complicate it
Dress it up or state it
Without too much hesitation
Here's the way I feel

I like you, I like you
Even when I don't try to
Yes I do, that's the truth
I like you

Seven years is a long, long while
Somehow you still make me smile
I'd say almost most the time
Here's the way I feel

I like you, I like you
Even when I don't try to
Yes I do, that's the truth
I like you

There way too many love songs
And I think they've got it all wrong
Cause is not the mountain tops
It's the walking in between
And I like you walking next to me

Well I like you, I like you
Even when I don't try to
Yes I do, that's the truth
I like you
Even when I don't try to
I still like you
