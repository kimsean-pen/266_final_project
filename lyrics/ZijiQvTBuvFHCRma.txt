I get my beat with you
When we see things through
And I think about you all the time

Who're the winners in the game we're playing?
I don't even think they know
Who're the losers and how much they're paying?
I don't even think they know

I need to hear the truth
From the soul of you
Chase the moments we can share

Who're the winners in the game we're playing?
I don't even think they know
Who're the losers and how much they're paying?
I don't even think they know

They've got time
They've got life (such a wonderful thing)
Take, you take your time
Honey, take your time

I gotta hear the sound of the morning song
As the light plays with your hair
I'm blowing smoke, and I feel so damn fine that
I know you care

Who're the winners in the game we're playing?
I don't even think you know
Who're the losers and how much they're paying?
I don't even think they know

They've got time
They've got life
Gonna take a little more time
Beautiful thing, yeah
No one says rush in this life
Me and my woman got a righteous thing
Something the dollar can't buy
Take, take your time

One life, one life, one life

They've got time
They've got life
Take your time
Beautiful thing, yeah
Even when they say that your mad
Beautiful thing, yeah
It's only 'cause they're rushing to death
Beautiful thing, yeah

I get my beat with you
When we see things through
And I think about you all the time
We gotta righteous thing
Can't you settle for a dream?
This is something that the dollar can't buy
Take your time
Beautiful thing, yeah
