Have You Seen Her
One Month Ago Today I Was Happy As A Lark
But Now I Go For Walks To The Movies Maybe To The Park
I Have A Seat On The Same Ole Bench
To Watch The Children Play
You Know Tomorrows Their Future
But For Me Its Just Another Day
They All Gather Round Me They Seem To Know My Name
We Laugh, Tell A Few Jokes But It Still Doesnt Ease My Pain
I Know I Cant Hide From Her Memory
But Day After Day I Try
I Keep Saying She'll Be Back
But Today Again I Lied
I See Her Face Everywhere I Go
On The Street And Even At The Picture Show
Have You Seen Her Tell Me Have You Seen Her
Oh I Hear Her Voice As The Cold Winds Blow
In The Sweet Music On My Radio
Have You Seen Her Tell Me Have You Seen Her
Why Oh Why Did She Have To Leave And Go Away
Ohhhhh
I've Been Used To Having Someone To Lean On
And I'm Lost, Baby I'm Lost
Have You Seen Her Tell Me Have You Seen Her
Have You Seen Her Tell Me Have You Seen Her
She Left Her Kiss Upon My Lips
But She Left A Break Within My Heart
Have You Seen Her Tell Me Have You Seen Her
Oh I See Her Hand Reaching Out To Me
Only She Can Set Me Free
Have You Seen Her Tell Me Have You Seen Her
Why Oh Why Did She Have To Leave And Go Away
Oh Yeah
Ohhhhh I've Been Used To Having Someone To Lean On
And I'm Lost, Baby I'm Lost
Ohhhh
Have You Seen Her Tell Me Have You Seen Her
Ohhhh
As Another Day Comes To An End
I'm Looking For A Letter Or Something
