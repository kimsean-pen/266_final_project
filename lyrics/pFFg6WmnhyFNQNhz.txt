There's a rhythm in rush these days
The lights don't move and the colors don't fade
Leaves you empty with nothing but dreams
In a world gone shallow, in a world gone lean

There's some things a man cannot know
The gears won't turn and the leaves won't grow
There's no place to run and no gasoline
The engine won't turn and the train won't leave
The engine won't turn and the train won't leave

But I will stay with you tonight
Hold you close 'til the morning light
And in the morning watch a new day rise
We'll do whatever just to stay alive
We'll do whatever just to stay alive

Well the way I feel is the way I write
It isn't like the thoughts of the man who lies
We've got a truth and it's on our side
Dawn is coming, open your eyes
Dawn is coming, open your eyes

But I will stay with you tonight
Hold you close 'til the morning light
We've got a truth and it's on our side
Dawn is coming, open your eyes
Dawn is coming, open your eyes

Dawn is coming, open your eyes
Dawn is coming, open your eyes
Dawn is coming, open your eyes
Dawn is coming, open your eyes

There's a rhythm in rush these days
The lights don't move and the colors don't fade
And leaves you empty with nothing but dreams
In a world gone shallow, in a world gone lean
We've got a truth and it's on our side
Dawn is coming, open your eyes
