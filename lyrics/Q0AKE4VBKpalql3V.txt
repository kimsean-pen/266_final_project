I am drinkin'
I am rollin'
(you can't stop me)
I am hidin'
I am runnin'
(you can't stop me)

But I'll never forget you anyway
But I'll never forget you anyway
But I'll never forget you anyway
But I'll never forget you

I am drinkin'
I am rollin'
(you can't stop me)
I am runnin'
I am rollin'
(you can't stop me)

But I'll never forget you anyway
But I'll never forget you anyway
But I'll never forget you anyway
But I'll never forget you

Soon I came to realize
As this world began to turn
Have you ever considered hell
Only to return?

No fool for you
Inside out
Under the corner of your mouth (your mouth)
Fight this fear
Fight this fear
