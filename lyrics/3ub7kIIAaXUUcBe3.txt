Can you tell her tambourine girl
Something that I almost feel
You come to her with a secret
Know that life is gonna dream

It's alright
You and I will never understand the reasons why

I don't care about the future
When I've got no one around
Beat me with a tambourine, girl
No such thing as much too loud

It's alright
You and I will never understand the reasons why
Dizzy eyes
When you smile it always takes me to the other side
Oh do you want to take me to the void

Touch me touch me touch you there
Touch me touch me touch you there
Touch me touch me touch you there
Touch me touch me touch you there

Dizzy eyes
When you smile it always takes me to the other side
It's alright
You and I will never understand the reasons why
I'll take you down and feel a little while
Oh do you want to take me to the void
