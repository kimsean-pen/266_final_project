Surface slowly at your own speed
Waiting for some sky
We're all laughing, we're all faking
Just to see you smile

She waits her turn
She waits her time
And all her love
It sings, it shines

Have your coffee, splishy splashy
Frozen up the stairs
Hollow but so normal when she
Needs a piece of care

She waits her turn
She waits her time
And all her love
It sings, it shines

She's breaking, and she's bending
And she's breaking, and she's falling
She's closing, and she's breaking
She's spending, she's fall
