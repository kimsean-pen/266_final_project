Eve walked down to the garden
Serpent said shall we begin?
If God up above wants you so dumb
What kinda devil does that make him?

Adam's scorn was upon Eve
He said woman you made me sin
Eve said the true God came down from above
Took a snake just to let the light in

God came down from heaven
Said what have you two done?
They said if that's the kind of God you're gonna be
Maybe heaven ain't so much fun

Tell me what's that love? Lucifer's the love
Tell me what's that love? Lucifer's the love
Tell me what's that love? Lucifer's the love
Lucifer's the love of the world
Lucifer's the love of the world
