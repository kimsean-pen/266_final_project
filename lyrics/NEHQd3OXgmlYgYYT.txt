I never go, I never go back

It's not my baby
Not the girl I knew then
Not the girl I know now, anymore
I would not leave you
Baby, don't you leave me
Baby, don't you love me anymore?

Always lookin' 'round you
Tryna see the good thing
Why you always say that you never done wrong?
Why you never hold me?
Tell me that you love me?
Why you always say that you'd never let go?

I never go back no, no, no
I never go, I never go back
I never go back no, no, no
I never go, I never go back

I would not do this
I don't wanna do this
Girl, we shouldn't do this anymore
"Quiero dejarte, no me necesitas"
¿Por qué siempre dices eso, mi amor?

Always lookin' 'round you
Tryna see the good thing
Why you always say that you never done wrong?
Why you never hold me?
Tell me that you love me?
Why you always say hat you'd never let go?

I never go back no, no, no

I oughtta leave you, wanna leave you
But I can't let go
I oughtta leave you, wanna leave you

I oughtta leave you, wanna leave you
But I can't let go
