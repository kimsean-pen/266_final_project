I said, "I love you" first
Standing in your kitchen wearing nothing, but your favorite shirt
And that's what makes this hurt
'Cause right now you're only remember-remembering the worst

And I hate this, yeah, I hate it
That we're ending so ugly, didn't have to be this way
And I hate that, that you hate me
That we're ending so ugly, didn't have to be this way

You, you, you can call me the bad guy
If it helps you sleep at night
Oh, oh, wouldn't be the first time
That you made me the bad guy

You think you're the only one hurt
And that's the reason why we don't work
You, you, you can call me the bad guy
You can call me the bad guy
You can call me the bad guy

I always put you first
So why did you make me feel like I came in third?
And you have the nerve
To blame me for something you know I don't deserve, no

And I hate this, yeah, I hate it
That we're ending so ugly, didn't have to be this way
And I hate that, that you hate me
That we're ending so ugly, didn't have to be this way

You, you, you can call me the bad guy
If it helps you sleep at night
Oh, oh, wouldn't be the first time
That you made me the bad guy

You think you're the only one hurt
And that's the reason why we don't work
You, you, you can call me the bad guy
You can call me the bad guy
You can call me the bad guy

We got different versions, but that's alright
That's alright, that's alright
'Cause I know that deep down you know I tried
And you know why I said goodbye, so

You, you, you can call me the bad guy
If it helps you sleep at night
Oh, oh, wouldn't be the first time
That you made me the bad guy

You think you're the only one hurt
And that's the reason why we don't work
You, you, you can call me the bad guy
You can call me the bad guy
You can call me the bad guy
You can call me the bad guy
You can call me the bad guy
