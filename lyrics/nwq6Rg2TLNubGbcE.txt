Take it back, I never meant it
Never thought it would come to pass.
Baby know its not forgotten, baby know that this is gonna last
*marbles in mouth* ... Had it coming
I recall the tremble in your eyes
I just want to make it better, I just want to make it right

Driven on the mile home, Driven on the mile home
Things are always better when were all together
Im driving on the last mile home

Tell me that the bar is drinking, and the lights are swinging in the smoke
Im a fool for conversation, and I've got nowhere to go

x2
Driven on the mile home, Driven on the mile home
Things are always better when were all together
Im driving on the last mile home

Driven on the last mile home, dreaming on the last mile home
Things are always better when were all together
Im driving on the last mile home

Baby I'm the one who's broken, maybe im the breaker of the hearts
Been so lone since we've last spoken, its been lonely baby its been hard
