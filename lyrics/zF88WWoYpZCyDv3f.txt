Free of the "I" and "Mine"
Ready to finally see
severing everything keeping me
under lock and key
when we cease to exist
our mind is truly free
Bypassing the social hierarchy
This is what i need
to take the pressure off of me
Awakening

to break the chained reality
Awakening
Ignite this fire inside of me
Awakening
Light Is cast on shadows of doubt
Tighten the vice, sharpen the knife
consciousness
The escape from which we kill
We are the dogs that can't be trained
Progression through
breaking yourself
