I know how numb some types
Of life can make you feel
Left you wondering where your friends have gone
Wish I could fit somewhere
Wishin' for a station that fits my drive
Wish we could jump ahead
How backwards we have come

And I know and I know we're gonna
Get kicked down during the fight
And I know and I know that most of us
Are hurting inside
And it's hard when all sides think they're right

History loves to repeat
History la la la loves to repeat
Over and over, over and over
Over and over in my mouth
Over and over, over and over
Over and over in my mouth

How did it get so bad?
How did such ugliness stir up?
How can I say I'm free?
I've given you rights to keep on tracking me

And the eye in the sky will be watching down
Like a God up above
And I know that I saw some
Beauty around I must dig it up
Let you know if some turns up

I drop my head from time to time
I drop my head from time to time
As long as it knows it has to get back up
It can have the break from time to time

I know how numb some types
Of life can make you feel
The hatred thanks to fear is real
So just keep on mixing, mix all people
Soon enough and we'll all belong
Keep on mixing, mix all people
Swirl enough and we'll all belong

How did it get so bad?
How did such ugliness stir up?
How can I say I'm free?
I've given you rights to keep on

Keep on
Keep on tracking me

Keep on
Keep on
Keep on tracking me

Keep on
Keep on
