I've been down so long
You know, down don't bother me

I've been down so long
You know, down don't bother me
Gonna take all my troubles
And cast 'em in the deep, blue sea

I work hard every day
I come straight home at night
And no matter how hard I try
Y'know you never wanna treat me right

I've been down so long
You know, down don't bother me
I'm gonna take all my troubles
And cast 'em in the deep, blue sea

I bought you a nice coat for Christmas
And a diamond ring
And now you've got the nerve to tell me
My love don't mean a thing

I've been down so long
'Til down don't bother me
I'm gonna cast all my worries
And take 'em to the deep, blue sea

I work hard every day
I come straight home at night
And no matter how I try, I try
You never wanna treat me right

I've been down so long
You know, down don't bother me
I'm gonna cast all my worries
And take 'em to the deep, blue sea
