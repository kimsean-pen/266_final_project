So he's lying on top again
Just like Gepetto and his doll
And he's running around again
And I can't get him out of this house

And if you bore him
You lose your soul to me

So that kid from the bad home
Came over my house again
Decapitated all my dolls

And if you bore me
You lose your soul to me

Hey, Gepetto, where'd you put it?
Oh, Gepetto, poor boy
Hey, Gepetto, where'd you put it?
Oh, Gepetto, poor boy

And if you bore him
You're gonna lose your soul

Hey, Gepetto, where'd you get to?
Oh, Gepetto, poor boy
Hey Gepetto, where'd you get to?
Oh, Gepetto, poor boy

Hey, Gepetto, what'd you get me?
Oh, Gepetto, poor boy
So he's lying on top again
Just like Gepetto
