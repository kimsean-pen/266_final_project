If I got down on my knees and I pleaded with you
Not to go but to stay in my arms
Would you walk out the door
Like you did once before?
This time, be different
Please stay, don't go
If I call out your name like a prayer
Would you leave me alone in my fear
Knowing I need you so?
Would you still turn and go?
This time, be different
Please stay, don't go, please stay
I loved you before I even knew your name
I wanted to give you my heart
But when you came back after leaving me one time
Oh, I knew, oh, how I knew that the heartaches would start
And I called out your name like a song
What was written for you and you alone
Would you still hurt my pride
Baby 'tilI, 'till I cried?
This time, be different
Please stay, don't go, please stay
You know I'm always love you, darling
Please stay, don't go, please, please stay
