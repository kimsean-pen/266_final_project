Today's the day that we start this war.
Make up your mind and decide what you're fighting for.
You still have so much left to learn about decisions to make.
Your so hard to break.
If you can't make room for raising the stakes
You'll find yourself exposed to the fallout.
It's been a drawn out series of undeniable mistakes
The perfect punch to a perfect line.
I'm not gonna make it!
Tonight's not good for me, it's true.
But not for the reasons you might think.
Cause I've got better things to do.
Well have you ever loved so much that you'd kill for it?
I'd kill for this
From the bottom of the barrel to the tip of my tongue
Feeling old but we're still so young
Because we are the ones that you're searching for.
We're causing all the trouble, only looking for more.
That's why we'll carry on with a heart of gold.
We're still young but we're getting older every time I turn around.
The perfect place and the perfect time.
I'm not gonna make it.
Tonight's not good for me, it's true.
But not for the reasons you might think.
Cause I've got better things to do.
I'm not gonna make it.
Tonight's not good for me, it's true.
But not for the reasons you might think.
Cause I've got better things...
WAAAAAAR!
(This is an outrage)
Today's the day that we start this war
(This is an outrage)
Make up your mind and decide
(This is an outrage)
This is an outrage, I'm so disgusted
(This is an outrage)
Tie God up, we swear it's running out
Watch out outside
So listen up, if you still feel, like I still feel, then rise up.
Then rise up and don't fuck off
I'm not gonna make it.
Tonight's not good for me, it's true.
But not for the reasons you might think.
Cause I've got better things to do.
