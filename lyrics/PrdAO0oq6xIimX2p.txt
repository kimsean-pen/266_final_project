I was half awake
Flying down the interstate
Mesmerized by power lines and blighted dour estates

And all the things I just felt
Somewhere in the rust belt
Wondering how many times can a heart melt
Still hoping your season will start well

Pardon my semantics
It's somewhat pedantic
But your outline against the Atlantic
Well it's idyllic and highly romantic

In a dream
Oh I took several transfers to the G Line
Now Bushwick Inlet's just to our right
I'd never seen Manhattan at night
I said it's lovely, you said that's right

Sidewalks, brownstones, and street posts
They line my dreams in complete rows

On cold days she wears a pea coat
While staring out from the east coast

A furtive glance as the fields roll
A stray outsider that she knows

Could I be someone you need most
When I'm so far from the east coast
