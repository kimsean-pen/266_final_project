You say you feel so down
Every time I turn around
And you say
You should've been gone by now

And you think
That everything's wrong
You ask me
How to carry on
We'll make it through
Another day, just hold on

'Cause, life starts now
You've done all the things
That could kill you somehow
And you're so far down
But you will survive it somehow
Because life starts now

I hate to see you fall down
I'll pick you up off the ground
I've watched the
Weight of your world come down

And now it's your,
Your chance to move on
Change the way you've
Lived for so long
And find the strength
You've had inside all along

'Cause, life starts now
You've done all the things
That could kill you somehow
And you're so far down
But you will survive it somehow
Because life starts now

All this pain
Take this life
And make it yours
All this hate
Take your heart
And let it love again
You will survive this somehow

Life starts now
You've done all the things
That could kill you somehow
And you're so far down

Life starts now
You've done all the things
That could kill you somehow
And you're so far down
Life starts now
