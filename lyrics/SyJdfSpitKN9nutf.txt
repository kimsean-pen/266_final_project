Walking down another cold dark street
I'm waiting for the dawn
Another coffee shop, a blimpie base
A-keep me warm until dawn

The heat from the sewer grate don't warm my bed
The snow aint cold anymore
Feet are so cold from the holes in my shoes
The churches locked all their doors

But I don't care
Go and push me away
You can't hurt me anymore
Not anymore

I'll sing your hymns for a cup of soup
So hungry, I don't care
An' how 'bout let me lay down for a little while
In a warm dry place

Or gimme a quarter for the movies all night
I gotta stay awake
Afraid of sleepin' and 'm freezin' to death
I gotta keep me awake
