ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER TIME
ANOTHER FLAME THAT BURNS DIVINE
ANOTHER WORD, ANOTHER THOUGHT
ANOTHER SIN, ANOTHER HOPE
ANOTHER REASON TO AWAKE AND LIVE THIS LIFE

Caught in silver clouds
Enlightened by a mystic full moon
You designed the horizon
And amaze my minute heart

Past, present, future
Trapped in this concept of time
I raise my mind's eye
To the infinite which lies

In a silent night spreading wild
Stellar might, dark Heaven
Fill my art, trance my way
Shining grace forever

ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER TIME
ANOTHER FLAME THAT BURNS DIVINE
ANOTHER WORD, ANOTHER THOUGHT
ANOTHER SIN, ANOTHER HOPE
ANOTHER REASON TO AWAKE AND LIVE THIS LIFE

'CAUSE ONCE MORE I BELONG TO THE STARS
I BELONG TO THE STARS

Hiding forbidden truths
Keepers of knowledge hard to define
Keepers of velvet secrets
Veiling softly our cries

Jewels reflecting light
Evolving cores of galactic life
You who forged my essence
The wild breath of mortal mind

In a silent night spreading wild
Stellar might, dark Heaven
Fill my art, trance my way
Shining grace forever

ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER TIME
ANOTHER FLAME THAT BURNS DIVINE
ANOTHER WORD, ANOTHER THOUGHT
ANOTHER SIN, ANOTHER HOPE
ANOTHER REASON TO AWAKE AND LIVE THIS LIFE

'CAUSE ONCE MORE I BELONG TO THE STARS

Solo.

ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER TIME
ANOTHER FLAME THAT BURNS DIVINE
ANOTHER WORD, ANOTHER THOUGHT
ANOTHER SIN, ANOTHER HOPE
ANOTHER REASON TO AWAKE AND LIVE THIS LIFE
ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER TIME
ANOTHER FLAME THAT BURNS DIVINE
ANOTHER WORD, ANOTHER THOUGHT
ANOTHER SIN, ANOTHER HOPE
ANOTHER REASON TO AWAKE AND LIVE THIS LIFE
'CAUSE ONCE MORE I BELONG TO THE STARS
I BELONG TO THE STARS
ONCE MORE I BELONG TO THE STARS
