Maybe you need some time on your own
'Til you figure this out
Well what if you sit inside by yourself and tape the windows shut?
You could black out the sun and watch the moon eclipse for a while

Hey, hey, it's alright
I know you think you haven't got time but you've got your whole life
Sometimes I think I need to watch the world go by
'Cause I don't wanna always have to try

Maybe today when I go out, it will feel different
And I won't be scared at all
When a stranger sits too close to me, I won't panic
I won't feel my skin crawl
Well I won't hate my body, yeah I won't get a ticket
I'll find what I'm looking for, I'll fill a hole
Yeah I will smell the roses, I won't see any posers
And all my debt will turn to simply nothing at all

Hey, hey, it's alright
I know you think you haven't got time but you've got your whole life
Sometimes I think I need to watch the world go by
'Cause I don't wanna always have to try
Hey, hey, it's alright
I know you think you haven't got time but you've got your whole life
Sometimes I think I need to watch the world go by
'Cause I don't wanna always have to try

Yeah, I don't wanna always have to try
Yeah, I don't wanna always have to try
