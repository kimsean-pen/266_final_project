I guess, even at my place I won't get recess

I should have left, now it might be too late
(I guess, even at my place I won't get recess)
I'm holding up my own jail

Useless, overdose of time
Stuck in this phase, in this phase

I'm feeling great 'til I'm laying in bed
(Useless, overdose on time stuck in this phase, in this phase)
I know this rhyme, no melodies, sounds again

Useless, overdose of time
Stuck in this phase, in this phase

'Cause if I wake up feeling lonely one more time
Oh boy, I try

I need to stay awake tonight
Because you're slipping in my mind
'Cause when I'm finally floating
I know what the dreams gonna be about
I know what that dream is about

Useless, overdose of time
Stuck in this phase, in this phase

I'm feeling great 'til I'm laying in bed
(Useless, overdose on time stuck in this phase, in this phase)
I know this rhyme, no melodies, sounds again

Useless, overdose of time
Stuck in this phase, in this phase

'Cause if I wake up feeling lonely one more time
Oh boy, I've tried

I need to stay awake tonight
Because you're slipping in my mind
'Cause when I'm finally floating
I know what the dreams gonna be about
I know what that dream is about

'Cause if I wake up feeling furious one more time
(One more time)
'Cause if I wake up feeling nauseous one more time
(Not one more time)
Then I'll be lonely one more time

Useless, overdose of time
Stuck in this phase
