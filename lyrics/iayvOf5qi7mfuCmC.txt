Only the faintest
Only the faintest glance buries you, buries me
So fire your engine
See if I give a damn, we'll be dust instantly

Caught in a jet stream
Caught in a gorgeous howl all the world lost in noise
Use me forever
Use me for rocket fuel, I'll be air, I'll be fire

You say, you love me like the silence of the turning earth
You say, you love me like the endless roar of modern life
You say, you love me like the laughter and the kissed back tears
You say, you love me like the past, the now, the coming years

What will you remember?
What will you think of me after I say goodbye?
Returning in bodies
Plants and the sand you'll squeeze in between shoe less feet

I know, I love you like the slivered gold of dying days
I know, I love you like an ancient history brought to life
I know, I love you like the sunlit water on your skin
I know, I love you like the million times I never said

I know, you love me like the silence of the turning earth
I know, you love me like the endless roar of modern life
I know, you love me like the laughter and the kissed back tears
I know, you love me like the past, the now, the coming years
