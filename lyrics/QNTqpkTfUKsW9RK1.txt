Momentum!

Oh, I am back, back down, I'm unsatisfied
I have millions to inspire
Like the radiance from all the galaxies
In a single massive fire

Oh, I'm the eye of the storm, I'm the enemy
Of delusional complexity
And I fight every war 'cause I have to be
The savior from insanity

We crossed the line
Between the world of space and time
(Space and time)
And into systems undefined

Momentum, bring our salvation
(Salvation!)
As we cross the speed of light and time
Gonna blast through like a satellite
Momentum, raise expectations
Like the universe is unified
And there's nothing left to magnify
Momentum!

Oh, what you feel right now is your liberty
And the absence of the liars
Though the world was alight in a blaze of flames
You were always in denial

Oh, if fate was a game and a strategy
I would stake it all in destiny
I will reap what I sow, I am set to be
Free to reject the jealousy

We crossed the line
Between the world of space and time
(Space and time)
And into systems undefined

Momentum, bring our salvation
(Salvation!)
As we cross the speed of light and time
Gonna blast through like a satellite
Momentum, raise expectations
Like the universe is unified
And there's nothing left to magnify
Momentum!

Ooh, rock the foundation
(Ey! Ey! Ey!)
I see the chance of a lifetime
For my creation
(Ey! Ey! Ey!)
I override the unstoppable shutdown

We crossed the line
Between the world of space and time
(Space and time)
And into systems undefined

Momentum, bring our salvation
(Salvation!)
As we cross the speed of light and time
Gonna blast through like a satellite
Momentum, raise expectations
Like the universe is unified
And there's nothing left to magnify
Momentum!
