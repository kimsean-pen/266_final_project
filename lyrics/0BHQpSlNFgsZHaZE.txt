This is a journey meant for your anxiety
This is a journey meant for your anxiety
This is a journey meant for your anxiety
This is a journey meant for your anxiety

Body of a monkey and the feet of a cock
Dragged from her home on the killing rock
Black dog dying on the weather vain
The Devil's in a cat and the baby's brain

The end, the end of the American
The end, the end of the American
The end, the end of the American
The end, the end of the American Witch

Alone on the hill and ready to die
Cancer of darkness blacken eye
The mark of the wolf and the sign of the calf
Angels bleed down above the raft

We all pray for, 20 innocents
We all bow down, 20 innocents
We all hang high, 20 innocents
We all accused, 20 innocents

The end, the end of the American
The end, the end of the American
The end, the end of the American
The end, the end of the American Witch

Do you want to know where their dreams come from?
Some showed the faith and some showed none
Do you want to know where their dreams come from?
Some showed the faith and some showed none

We all pray for, 20 innocents
We all bow down, 20 innocents
We all hang high, 20 innocents
We all accused, 20 innocents

The end, the end of the American
The end, the end of the American
The end, the end of the American
The end, the end of the American Witch

Do you want to know where their dreams come from?
Some showed the faith and some showed none
Do you want to know where their dreams come from?
The end, the end of the American Witch
