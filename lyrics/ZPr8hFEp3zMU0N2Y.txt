High in the sky where eagles fly
Morgray the dark enters the throne

Open wide the gate, friend
The king will come
blow the horn and praise
The highest Lord
Who'll bring the dawn
He's the new god
In the palace of steel
Persuade the fate of everyone
The chaos can begin
Let it in

So many centuries
We were the prisoners
Of our own fantasy
But now we are marching
Against these Gods
I'm the wizard, I will change it all

Why've you ever forgotten me?

Why've you ever forgotten me?

Why've you ever forgotten me?

Why've you ever forgotten me?

Why've you ever forgotten me?

Why've you ever forgotten me?

Magic is in me
I'm the lost magic man
Never found what I was looking for
Now I found it but it's lost

The fortress burns
Broken my heart
I leave this world
All Gods are gone

So many centuries
We were the prisoners
Of our own fantasy
But then we had nothing
Who'll lead our life
No, no, we can't live without Gods

Why've you ever forgotten me?

Why've you ever forgotten me?

Why've you ever forgotten me?

Why've you ever forgotten me?

Why've you ever forgotten me?
