I'm not mad about anything
you forced on me a hopeless dream
I've been looking for one true thing
too numb to see I've been sleepwalking
too horrified to see

wait and think it doesn't get you down
you're flying now but you'll come back down
and with both your feet on the ground
you'll look around, yeah you'll look around
too horrified to see

I've been looking for some harmonies
some words to sing that could really bring
the lonely-hearted some company
all the people that were just like me yeah

when a decade is spent searching
for something time will never bring
something starts to shut down inside
my body and my tired mind
too horrified to see

can't you see your heart, it's hard now
your heart, it's hard now
can't you see, we've grown apart now
we've grown apart now
