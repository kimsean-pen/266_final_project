Georgia, Georgia
The whole day through
Just an old sweet song
Keeps that Georgia on my mind, on my mind

I said Georgia
mmm... Georgia
A song of you
Comes as sweet and clear
As moonlight through the pine

I know it does babe

Other arms reach out to me

Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you
Oh I, Georgia

Georgia, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song
An old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Oh, just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia, on my mind
There'll always be Georgia
