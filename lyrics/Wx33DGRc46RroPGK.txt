I'm in a hot tub, cool from the suds
Where is my Dove, I'm losing my breath
I'm breaking a sweat, I think that I'm black out
It's so beautiful, so miserable
Kind of a joke, and I'm kind of broke
I really think I just need a soda

Feels just like I remember
Giving into all my pleasures
They all make me feel much better
Here's to hoping I surrender

Meet me on an island
On an island far from here
Meet me on an island
Come on baby, let's disappear
Come on baby, let's disappear

Watch the sunrise through my red eyes
Desensitized, bottom's up
I'm out of luck, I feel nothing
I'm floating here and I'm staying weird
For one more goddamn wasted year
But I'm fine with treading here forever

Feels just like I remember
Giving into all my pleasures
They all make me feel much better
Here's to hoping I surrender

Meet me on an island
On an island far from here
Meet me on an island
Come on baby, let's disappear
Come on baby, let's disappear

What's the point of waking up
If you can't fly?
What's the point of coming down
When you're sky high
When you're sky high

Feels just like I remember
Giving into all my pleasures
They all make me feel much better
Here's to hoping that I'll make it out

Meet me on an island
On an island far from here
Meet me on an island
Come on baby let's disappear

Meet me on an island
On an island far from here
Meet me on an island
Come on baby let's disappear
Come on baby let's disappear
