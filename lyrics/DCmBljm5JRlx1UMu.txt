Take my hand, I got a place for you
Out on the dance floor
One more time, I wanna rendezvous
Out on the dance floor

Feel the night
In a fall from time
As I, lose my mind to you, again
If I ever said goodbye
I would, lose my mind to you, again

Turn the lights, down, now
Turn the music, loud
(I wanna dance)
Lights down, now
Turn the music, loud
(I wanna dance)

I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
(Dance with you)
I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
(Dance with you)

Dont forget, I think I always knew,
Out on dance floor,
Can't nobody move the way you do,
Out on the dance floor

Feel the night
In a fall from time
As I, lose my mind to you, again
If I ever said goodbye
I would, lose my mind to you, again

Turn the lights, down, now
Turn the music, loud
(I wanna dance)
Lights down, now
Turn the music, loud
(I wanna dance)

I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
(Dance with you)

I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
(Dance with you)

Just take the ride, girl take a ride and dance with you

Turn the lights, down, now
Turn the music, loud
(I wanna dance)
Lights down, now
Turn the music, loud
(I wanna dance)

I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
(Dance with you)

I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
(Dance with you)

I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
(Dance with you)

I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
I wanna dance dance
(Dance with you)
