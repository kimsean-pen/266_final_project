Every time your body pass me by (uh uhh uh uhh)
I build bridges just to cross your mind (uh uhh uh uhh)
Yes i try, yes i try, yes i try
To keep myself together
Dating boys that i don't really like
To see if they could touch me like you do

Every night, every night, every night
All i wanna do is call
Do you want me to, do you want me to

When you're not around
I just waste my time
Trying to find somebody
Trying to find somebody like you (uh uhh uh uhh)
Trying to find somebody
Trying to find somebody like you (uh uhh uh uhh)
Trying to find somebody
Trying to find somebody like you

Twenty four seven when we were young (uh uhh uh uhh)
And i still can taste you on my tongue (uh uhh uh uhh)
In my bed, in my head, in my heart
The pictures never faded
And i guess i should've known from the start
That castles made of glass can fall apart

Every night, every night, every night
All i wanna do is call
Do you want me to do you want me to

When you're not around (uh uhh uh uhh)
I just waste my time
Trying to find somebody
Trying to find somebody like you (uh uhh uh uhh)
Trying to find somebody
Trying to find somebody like you (uh uhh uh uhh)
Trying to find somebody
Trying to find somebody like you

If you change your mind (uh uhh uh uhh)
Everything is right
I just need somebody
I just need somebody like you
