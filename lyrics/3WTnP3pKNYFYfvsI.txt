A branch leaves its leaves
The soil is begging please
Don't make another mess this season
A storm with a six letter name
I'm responsible for this hurricane
A big box if IOU's rests inside my chest
With my hand holding a letter wishing you my very best
I did not sign my name
I'm responsible but won't take the blame
A northwest climate on the brink of breaking
That's behind your eyes while my hands are shaking
A revolving door that has no shame
I'm responsible and will not change
This homebody doesn't need anybody
This body would rather be left alone
This nobody doesn't deserve anybody
It becomes clearer as it goes
