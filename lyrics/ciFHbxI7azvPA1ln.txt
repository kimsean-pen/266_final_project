Driving by
Passing thought
From the left side
Think it through
And to you
Bending in unison
Can't sleep
Sweat the sheets
Eyes above stare deep
Later day
Weekend
Crowding and sinking
Go on now, you speak of pressure
Take all of mine
Find another way
Now slip again
So touch and go
Another line
A phrase and flow
Now slip again
So touch and go
Another line
A phrase and flow
Go on now, you speak of pressure
Take all of mine
Find another way
Go, go
Living on the inside
Crying eyes
A knife at night
Suicide all the time
It's taking over your face
So come on
Go, go
Living on the inside
Crying eyes
A knife at night
Suicide all the time
Taking over your face
So come on
See you (see you)
See you alone
Pick up the telephone
Telephone
Saving face
Or self-effacing?
Keeping pace
In a stasis
Saving face
Or self-effacing?
Keeping pace
In a stasis
Come on now, you speak of pressure
Take all of mine
Find another way
Cut along
The dotted align
Tear and share everywhere
Out of time
Daylight and far away
To [?] the life
Medicate, medicate
Make it, now they're mine [?]
Come on now, you speak of pressure
Take all of mine
Find another way
Go, go
Living on the inside
Crying eyes
A knife at night
Suicide all the time
Taking over your face
So come on
Go, go
Living on the inside
Crying eyes
A knife at night
Suicide all the time
Taking over your face
So come on
See you (see you)
See you alone
See you (see you)
See you alone
See you (see you)
See you alone
Pick up the telephone
(Pick up the telephone)
