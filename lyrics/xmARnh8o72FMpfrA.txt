Givench–
Ah, det skulle komma in där?
(STRANGER)
Ah, det kommer inte än, nu
Givenchy!

I got lots of swag and I be feelin' hurt
Walk up in the bank like John Dillinger (Woke up, woke up)
Rainbows, I'm willin' to splurge (Splurge)
After you've gone, I'm still on the Earth
No, no, no, you can't get my bank roll (Bank roll)
Slow, slow, slow, this cup got me slow (Slow motion)
Low, low, low, shawty, bring it to the floor (Get low)
Oh, oh, oh, SBE in this bitch got more (Sadboys)

Ski mask, shawty, got whatever you like (You like)
Moncler jackets, dirty cash, plenty flights (Flights)
Cocaine clean but my jeans really dirty
I just copped some silver rings and they go about Thirty
Ski mask, shawty, I pull up with the team (Pull up, pull up!)
Ski mask, shawty, I still see you in my dreams (Lean!)
Dirty Fanta, shawty, bitch, I'll never leave (l'll never leave!)
Dirty Fanta, shawty, bitch, I'll never leave (Skrrt, skrrt!)

Flow, flow, flow on the floor, floor, floor (Up on the floor)
Percs, percs, percs got me out of control
Iced-out on the floor, rubber bands can't even fold (They can't)
Girls all in my phone, ho-ho Santa Clause
Ski mask, shawty prayin' down to my knees (I'm prayin' down)
Louis Sprite Gang, shawty all over me
Check out my waist and check out my sleeves (Check it out)
When I ride around, I keep my stacks on my feet (Woa, woa)
Ski mask, shawty, keep the racks for the team (For the team)
Ten toes down in my head, I'm not clean (I'm not clean)
Reality for me—I don't see it like you see (I don't)
Broken Piano, pockets stuffed with magic beans
Walk up in the club, I got like fifty birds (Walk up, walk up)
Need this gun on me, I'm still on the search
I got straight hunneds, straight drop
Love of my life, she gon' set me up
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up in the parkin' lot (Pull up, pull up)
Bitch, we sellin' wine and I'm breakin' rocks
Just keep going, I don't wanna stop
Pull up, pull up in the parking lot
Dough, dough, dough, I got dough, dough, dough
More like Bart Simpson in my song, song, song
Clone, clone, clone, you a clone, clone, clone
All so low, I'ma hop on the road

Ski mask, shawty, got whatever you like (Pull up, pull up)
Moncler jackets, dirty cash, plenty flights
Cocaine clean but my jeans really dirty
I just copped some silver rings and they go about Thirty
Ski mask, shawty, I pull up with the team (Pull up, pull up)
Ski mask, shawty, I still see you in my dreams (Out of control)
Dirty Fanta, shawty, bitch, I'll never leave
Dirty Fanta, shawty, bitch, I'll never leave

Santa Clause, Leandoer, Stranger
Shout out Yung Gud
This is Gud my man, you already know
Six hundred beats, six hundred days, six hundred songs
I can't sleep no more, I gotta make another hit
Wake up in the morning and I make another hit
You know how it going 'cause life is a bitch
