Mother left you in the night
My father faded into the same light
Now we're both hoping to find someone

I hope you hear this song
And you leave your old boyfriend
Come back where you belong
In my arms

Kaitlin, Kaitlin
Kaitlin, Kaitlin

All of the days and the nights
You and I and a dream in Ojai
Filling up both of our lives
With love

Sometimes you're like the wind
Like my mother sang in 1987
Now your life's sure to begin

Kaitlin, Kaitlin
Kaitlin, Kaitlin

All comes back to you
Wonder if you'll choose
Anyone to love
Anyone to love

Now you're gone again
I gave all that I had to give
But I lost my friend

Just before the holiday
Unable to learn my own name
Or blow the wind away
What would you say

Kaitlin, Kaitlin
Kaitlin, Kaitlin

All comes back to you
Wonder if you'll choose
Anyone to love
Anyone to love
