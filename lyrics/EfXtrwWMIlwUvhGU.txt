Your loving like the raindrops
That cover everything
Made kisses rain like feverish sin
Onto the barren longing of my lips dear

And weightless like the raindrop
Carried away with the wind
Melt into thin air
Food for the clouds
With which we sway
To the dull pounding off the rain

Your loving like the raindrops caused
A sweeping muddy deluge force
That plowed through everd ill-lit bar
The left their longing door ajar
But in the light of unspent days
When spring has come and come to stay
And after all the roaming's done
And solitude has parched the land
I'm sure that I shall find someone
Who will also crave the rain again
