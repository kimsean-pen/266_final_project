And shadowy shapes did stare and roam
Beneath the dark and starry dome
That hung above the dawn of Earth
And shaken it with silver mirth

In later days when Morgoth first
Fleeing the Gods, their bondage burst
And on the mortal lands set feet
Far in the north on his mighty seat

There once, and long and long ago
Before the sun and moon we know
Were lit to sail above the world
When first the shaggy woods unfurled

There once, and long and long ago
Before the sun and moon we know
Were lit to sail above the world
When first the shaggy woods unfurled

And shadowy shapes did stare and roam
Beneath the dark and starry dome
That hung above the dawn of Earth
And shaken it with silver mirth

In later days when Morgoth first,
Fleeing the Gods, their bondage burst
And on the mortal lands set feet
Far in the north on his mighty seat

There once, and long and long ago
Before the sun and moon we know
Were lit to sail above the world
When first the shaggy woods unfurled

There once, and long and long ago
Before the sun and moon we know
Were lit to sail above the world
When first the shaggy woods unfurled

Death to light, to law, to love
Cursed be moon and stars and stars above
May darkness everlasting old
Drown Manwë, Varda and the shining sun

Death to light, to law, to love
Cursed be moon and stars and stars above
May darkness everlasting old
Drown Manwë, Varda and the shining sun

Death to light, to law, to love
Cursed be moon and stars and stars above
May darkness everlasting old
Drown Manwë, Varda and the shining sun

Death to light, to law, to love
Cursed be moon and stars and stars above
May darkness everlasting old
Drown Manwë, Varda and the shining sun
