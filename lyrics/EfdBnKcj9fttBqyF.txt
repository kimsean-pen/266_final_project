Well let's take off from the start
I know you tried all this before
And did your best to fight the war
And break it off
But if I follow my name
I will calm you in the storm
And breathe you in when you are worn
Be still my love
Would it take a shooting star?
To show you life can bloom when somethings breaks
When the pieces fall
I'll catch them all

Never mind what you're looking for
You'll always find what you're looking for
Sometimes it's blinding in the race
I'll be here smiling when I see your face

Never mind what you're looking for
You're gonna find what you're looking for
Sometimes it's blinding in the race
I'll be here smiling when I see your face

Yeah it's hard to know the truth
In this post-modernist view
Where absolutes are seen as relics
And laughed out of the room
And I'm scared to say your name
I've cried wolf so many times
Cause I'm afraid of what you'd want from me
Will you find me through the grey?
Cause my mind's a minefield of the wretched
It's honestly deceptive

Never mind what you're looking for
You'll always find what you're looking for
Sometimes it's blinding in the race
I'll be here smiling when I see your face

Never mind what you're looking for
You're gonna find what you're looking for
Sometimes it's blinding in the race
I'll be here smiling when I see your face

Never mind what you're looking for
You'll always find what youre looking for

Never mind what you're looking for
You'll always find what youre looking for
