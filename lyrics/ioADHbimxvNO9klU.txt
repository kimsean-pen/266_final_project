Oh oh Oh oh Oh oh ...

Join our paths
Is a question of moment
You blur the line

With a certain talent

I see a sign in everything
When you feign that you don't know
What it means

It's always a shiver
To be by your side
I feel the fever
You're blind

Rather than talking talking talking talking
I should have walking walking walking
And stuck my mouth to your tongue
Even if you think it would be wrong

Rather than talking talking talking talking
I should have walking walking walking
And stuck my mouth to your tongue
Even if you think it would be wrong

Even if you think it would be wrong
Even if you think it would be wrong
Even if you think it would be wrong
Even if you think it would be wrong

You flirt with the shore
As a clever diver
You know I want more
You dance on the wire

I'm a willing prey
But you hold back the spark

I can't wait anymore
To be bitten by the shark

It's always a shiver
To be by your side
I feel the fever
You're blind

Rather than talking talking talking talking
I should have walking walking walking
And stuck my mouth to your tongue
Even if you think it would be wrong

Rather than talking talking talking talking
I should have walking walking walking
And stuck my mouth to your tongue
Even if you think it would be wrong

Even if you think it would be wrong
Even if you think it would be wrong
Even if you think it would be wrong
Even if you think it would be wrong

Let's be friends
I will not pretend
That I understand
What you want

Let's be friends
I will not pretend
That I understand
What you want

That I understand
What you want

Even if you think it would be wrong
Even if you think it would be wrong
Even if you think it would be wrong
Even if you think it would be wrong
