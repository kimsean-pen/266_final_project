Sending current down the barbed wire
Burning currency in bonfires, there's no why
And are you passengers approved
Time kill is giving you too much to lose soon
With a dominance on narcissism in the metasphere setting concrete
Ill-affected by significant destruction
Might as well be catastrophic, catastrophic

Bending lies, disgust
Hiding behind the protection of the veil

Trying to untangle the map
Everything slips right through your shaking hands
Whether we ask for it or not
To live is to suffer again and again

Take the time to catch your breath
You're at a loss, you have no thoughts
No dialogue between yourself
And an intelligent objective

Bending lies, despised
Hiding behind the protection of the veil
Bending lies, despised
Hiding behind the tipping of the scales

Trying to untangle the map
Everything slips right through your shaking hands
Whether we ask for it or not
To live is to suffer again and again
