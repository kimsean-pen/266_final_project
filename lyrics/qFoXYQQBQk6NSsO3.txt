You try so hard to be cold
You try so hard to not show
I give you nothing to doubt and you doubt me
I give you all that I have but you don't see

Now I know that my eyes must close here
Every word seems to feel like you don't care
But I know that you're so confused and afraid
I just want to be one true thing that don't fade
I don't wanna give up tomorrow
I just can't understand why we're going on

You try so hard to be heard
You try so hard to not hurt
I give you nothing to doubt and you doubt me
I give you all that I have but you don't see

Now I know that my eyes must close here
Every word seems to feel like you don't care
But I know that you're so confused and afraid
I just want to be one true thing that don't fade
I don't wanna give up tomorrow
I just can't understand why we're going on

I don't wanna be sad
I don't wanna be scared
I don't wanna be sad
I don't wanna be scared

I don't wanna be sad
I don't wanna be scared
I don't wanna be sad
I don't wanna be scared

I don't wanna be sad
I don't wanna be scared
I don't wanna be sad
