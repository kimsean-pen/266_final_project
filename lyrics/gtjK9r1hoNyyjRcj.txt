By Starlight i'll kiss you
and promise to be your one and only
i'll make you feel happy

and leave you to be lost in mine
and where will we go
what will we do?
soon said i will know
and are you just like me?

dead eyes, dead eyes are you just like me?
her eyes, her eyes were as vacant as the seas

yeah
dead eyes, dead eyes are you just like me?
and all along we knew we'd carry on

just to belong
By Starlight i know you
as lovely as a wish granted true

my life has been empty, my life has been untrue
and does she really know, who i really am?
does she really know me at last

and are you just like me
dead eyes, dead eyes are you just like me
her eyes, her eyes were as vacant as the seas
dead eyes, dead eyes are you just like me?
and are you just like me?
and are you just like me?
and are you just like me?
