A narrow path
Now overgrown
Covered by grass
Almost gone

It whispers an invitation to me
Unveils a new direction

Around me the forest sings
The sun gilds the road

Here's my place
This is my world
Here's my future
I make my fire here

The trail leads me to the sea
The stones feel so familiar
On this cliff I've been before
And heard the song of the waves

The path turns to a road
The river flows into the sea
Around me the forest sings
The sun gilds the road

Here's my place
This is my world
Here's my future
I make my fire here

Here's my place
This is my world
Here's my future
I make my fire here

Here's my place
This is my world
Here's my future
I make my fire here
