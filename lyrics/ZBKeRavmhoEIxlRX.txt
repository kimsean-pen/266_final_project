Sometimes
I know, I feel untouchable
Drowning in life
Caught up in the accessible
Back down the ground I hear the sound
There's no escape the concrete cloud
Spilling on me
Drenching me with laymen's sins
I hear the sirens from the back of me
I'm crashing face first into the glass eye

Clash with reality
It rears it's ugly head
Clash with reality
The indescribable
Let the dogs lie
Where we fucking sleep

Irrelevant theme
A situation and there's nothing but right
In kicks the door
Nobody moves 'cause in walks the problem
Dictates your fate, evicts, convicts
Who'll sign the write of life?
This now becomes their morbid game
Who's piss poor excuse. Is this for a world?
It swells my hatred day by day

Clash with reality
It rears it's ugly head
Clash with reality
The indescribable

Clash with reality
It rears it's ugly head
Clash with reality
The indescribable

Reality
Clash with!
Reality
Clash!
