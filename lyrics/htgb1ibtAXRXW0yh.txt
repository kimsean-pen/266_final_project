Shining violence
Shining victim
In the headlights
Shining pistol
Shimmer diamonds from a necklace
Faceless driver, drive away

In the city

In the city
In the street
In the doorway
You can see them
Midnight walkers
Midnight eyes
Midnight footsteps
Midnight prize

In the city

Concrete river
I hear your voice
Concrete river
I see your face
Whisper to me
Ask me
Why?

Shining violence (in the city)
