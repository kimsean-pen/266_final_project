Eyeless in the morning sun, you were
Pale and mild, a modern girl
Taken with thought, still prone to care
Making tea in your underwear

You went out in the yard to find
Something to eat and clear your mind
Something bad inside me went away

Quaking leaves and broken light
Shifting skin, the coming night
The bearers of all good things arrive
Climb inside us, twist and cry

A kiss on your molten eyes
Myriad lives like blades of grass
Yet to be realized
Bow as they pass

They are cold, still
Waiting in the ether to form
Feel, kill
Propagate only to die

They are cold, still
Waiting in the ether to form
Feel, kill
Propagate only to die
Dissolve magically, absurdly
They'll end, leave
Dissipate coldly
And strangely return
