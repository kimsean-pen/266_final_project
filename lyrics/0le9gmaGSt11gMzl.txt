Can't somebody explain to me
Why everybody is tryin' to be
Livin' like a celebrity
Doin' what they see on MTV
Ice is cool but I'm lookin' for more
Simple things is what my heart beats for

Cause that's me
I don't ask for much
Baby
Havin' you is enough
You ain't got to buy nothin'
It's not what I want
Baby, it's you
We don't have to go nowhere
It's not what I want
Baby, it's you
It's not by what you got, I know you got a lot
No matter what you do, you always gettin' hot
It's you... it's you...

Baby, all I want is you, yeah

It don't matter that your car is fly
And your rims are spinnin' on the side
And it don't matter where we go tonight
Cause if I'm with you, I'll be alright

That's cool, but I'm lookin for more
It's your love that my heart beats for

Cause that's me
Don't have to spend a dime
Baby
I just want your time (yeah...)
You ain't got to buy nothin'
It's not what I want
Baby, it's you
We don't have to go nowhere (It's not what I want)
Baby, it's you
It's not by what you got, I know you got a lot
No matter what you do, you're always gettin hot

It's you... (it's you) It's you (Baby)
Baby all I want is you, yeah

(Hey... yeah)
You ain't got to buy nothin' (It's not what I want)
It's not what I want (oh)
Baby, it's you
We don't have to go nowhere (nowhere)
It's not what I want
Baby, it's you
It's not by what you got, I know you got a lot (hey, yeah)
No matter what you do, you're always gettin' hot
It's you... (it's you)... it's you
Baby (baby) all I want is you, yeah
(Yeah)
