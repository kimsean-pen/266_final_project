to go for seconds
a cold decision
righteous power or only a dud
you're not
comin to me
show me something

I don't expect you to turn water to wine

blood makes the grass grow
a little greener
tells you more than song and dance

the vicious retort out of fear
tell me who can hold your hand thru this

blood makes
the grass grow

no one comes back
