I saw my better half, the better half of a decade
Slip through my hands inside her hands inside my pockets
When she reached for her advantages
I should have done something

I saw my baby boy digging his own hole
Keepin' alive family traditions
When he lied about intentions
I, I should have done something
I should have done something

Well, I blame myself for everything
It keeps my conscience clean
I've got bandages to prove it, to prove it

I saw my better half, the better half of a decade
Slip through my hands inside her hands inside my pockets
When she reached for her advantages
I should have done something

I should have done something
I should have done something
I should have done something
I should have done something

I should have done something
I should have done something
I should have done something
I should have done something
