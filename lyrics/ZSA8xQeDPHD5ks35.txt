You'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs.
But I look around me and I see it isn't so.
Some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs.
And what's wrong with that?
I'd like to know, 'cause here I go again

I love you
(I love you)
I love you
(I love you)

I can't explain the feeling's plain to me, say can't you see?
Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me, now can't you see?
Love doesn't come in a minute
Sometimes it doesn't come at all

I only know that when I'm in it
It isn't silly, no isn't silly, love isn't silly at all.
I love you
I can't explain the feeling's plain to me, say can't you see?

Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me, now can't you see?
How can I tell you about my loved one?
You'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs.

Oh no

Some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs.
