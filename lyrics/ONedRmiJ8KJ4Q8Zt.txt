There is a game I play
Try to make myself okay
Try so hard to make the pieces all fit
Smash it apart
Just for the fuck of it

Bye, bye
(Ooh)
Gotta get back to the bottom
The big come down isn't that what you wanted?
Find a place with the failed and forgotten
Isn't that really what you wanted now?

There is no place I can go,
there is no play I can hide
It feels like it keeps
comin' from the inside

There is a hate that burns within,
The most desperate place I have ever been
Try to get back to where I'm from,
The closer I get the worse it becomes
The closer I get the worse it becomes
There is no place I can go,
there is no place I can hide
It feels like it keeps
coming from the inside
