One city in the center of the universe
Gates closed down, all shut down
One city in the center of the universe
The emptiest place ever

There is no room for the righteous
There is no room for man
Veiled inside a dark curtain of insanity

In the agony of deep profound seclusion
The will could never last
In the identity of everlasting structures
The end of all that ever was a cause

All that ever was

A step out of the sunlight
A step out of a small demise
A step into seclusion
To emphasize the point of life

One city in the burning of bright flames
Bright flames for hate of man
Veiled inside a hopeless curtain of insanity
In the agony of deep profound seclusion
The will could never last
In the identity of everlasting structures
The end of all that ever was a cause
All that ever was
A step out of the sunlight
A step out of a small demise
A step into seclusion
To emphasize the point of life
A step out of the sunlight
A step out of a small demise
A step into seclusion
To emphasize the point of life
