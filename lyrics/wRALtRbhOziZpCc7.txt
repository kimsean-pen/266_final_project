Hopes dashed to the floor
Like shattered teenage dreams
Boys livin' next door
Are never what they seem

A walk in the park can become a bad dream
People are starin' and followin' me
This is my only escape from it all
Watchin' a film or a face on the wall

Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian
Robert De Niro's waiting

I don't need a boy
I've got a man of steel
Don't come any closer
I don't wanna feel

You're breathing, you're touching, but nothing's for free
I never want this to happen to me
Don't try to change me you're wasting your time
Now I've got somethin' much better in mind

Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian
Robert De Niro's waiting

Talk talkin'
Talk talkin'

A walk in the park can become a bad dream
People are starin' and followin' me
This is my only escape from it all
Watchin' a film or a face on the wall

Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian
Robert De Niro's waiting
