The tenure of kings and their magistrates
By good men it must be deposed
The covenant made can be voided at once
Disanoint him, take his crown

They plead for their king
And they pity their lord
Put him to death, that's what I say

Though never so just these dancing divines
Endue him with reason and grace
Their gibberish words dissemble the facts
God's will they falsely will claim
Let him curse my name
On these blood stained pages of misery

Let him call me a tyrant so cruel
Let him curse my name
But remember the truth
So there they come
From everywhere

Their witness revenge
Hear them calling
"You're laden with blood
It's spilled everywhere"
And sorrow's everlasting
Oh you'll be aware now
That trial is near

It's close at hand
The masquerade is over...
It ends...
Ahhh ahhh ahhhh...
Ahhh ahhh ahhhh...

Remove his crown
And bring him down
Remove his crown
And bring him down
Now we shall mourn no longer
Our prayers they've been heard
Now we shall mourn no longer
Our prayers they've been heard
(We won't take it anymore) There's no more league
That will blind us to the tyrant (We won't take it anymore)
Our voices shall be heard
Cause we won't take it anymore
(We won't take it anymore) There's no more league
That will blind us to the tyrant (We won't take it anymore)
Our voices shall be heard
Cause we won't take it anymore
And we're one we are the nation (We won't take it anymore)
And we're one we are the law (We won't take it anymore)
And we're one we are the nation (We won't take it anymore)
And we're one we are the law (We won't take it anymore)

Falsely they praise
Deify his majesty
"He's blessed the anointed's
Fulfilling God's will"
Curse them all
No further he's king
Providence brought him straight into our hands

Let him curse my name
On these blood stained pages of misery
Let him call me a tyrant so cruel
Let him curse my name

But remember the truth
Now let him appear
There's joy in the air
Now witness a new age is dawning
In trouble alone
He's facing despair

Awaiting his bitter ending
We all know he's guilty as charged
By punishment due to his crime
We sacrifice the wicked king

Acknowledged by scriptures and law
Let him curse my name
On these blood stained pages of misery
Let him call me a tyrant so cruel
Let him curse my name but remember the truth...
On these blood stained pages of misery
Let him call me a tyrant so cruel
Let him curse my name but remember the truth...
We won't take it anymore
Our voice it shall be heard
We won't take it anymore
But I will remember the truth
We won't take it anymore
Our voice it shall be heard
We won't take it anymore
But I will remember the truth
