Walking backwards down the street
I don't know who I'm gonna meet
I guess they think it's kind of strange
They see me and they walk away
Feeling come and come to us
We forgot which way to go
And as if we'd never know
We should have take the other road

Always on the microphone
Staring at? tears?
Sometimes it's better just to fall
? like a snake
Guess I'm kind of wide awake
Don't know how much I can take
I feel I'm fine awake

Now, now that you're gone
They say just go on and on, and on
Now that you're gone
They say just go on and on, and on

Close my eyes and count to ten
Gonna get there in the end
Go and forward to come act
I knew that it'd be just like that
Everyday and every night
Cruise around just like a kite
Seating on an airplane
All the clouds just look the same

And all the clouds just look the same
All the clouds just look the same
All the clouds just look the same

Now, now that you're gone
They say just go on and on, and on
Now that you're gone
They say just go on and on, and on

Now, now that you're gone
They say just go on and on, and on
Now that you're gone
They say just go on and on, and on
