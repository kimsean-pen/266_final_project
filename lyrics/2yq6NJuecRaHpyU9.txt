Child I'm a fool for ya
Ain't too proud of that
For when it comes to love and pride
Pride is something that I seem to lack

Our relation's in danger
And you act like a stranger
But this time I'm not flyin'
'Cause I ain't got the time

Make a mess of me
Which wasn't supposed to be
We were supposed to change
It couldn't be arranged

Your mama's son
And sisters do
All here today
Unite and true
She acts in love
I help myself
Distrust your sign
Ain't got no time

Playin' with you
And you didn't cut me loose
I won't say that we're losers
It's just a mutual choosin'

'Cause what is yours is mine
Is just yours in my mind
You're not convincing my mind
'Cause I ain't got the time

Our love had gone to blow
Can't get hung up no more
And now ain't nothin' left
Get up and help yourself

You double-cross
Your lover's boss
Ignored advice
And blew our lives
Your useless prayer
I cannot bare
It wasn't fair
You should have cared

Ain't got it
Ain't got it
Ain't got it
Ain't got it
Ain't got it
Ain't got it

Your mama's son
And sisters do
All here today
Unite and true
She acts in love
I help myself
Distrust your sign
Ain't got no time

Ain't got it
Ain't got it
Ain't got it
Ain't got it

You double-cross
Your lover's boss
Ignored advice
And blew our lives
Your useless prayer
I cannot bare
It wasn't fair
You should have cared

Ain't got it
Ain't got it
Ain't got it
Ain't got it
