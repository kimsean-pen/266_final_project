Yeah, oh yeah, no!
Cold ground was my bed last night
And rock was my pillow too
Cold ground was my bed last night
And rock was my pillow too, yeah

I'm sayin talkin' blues, talkin' blues
They say your feet is just too big for your shoes
Talkin' blues, talkin' blues
Your feet is just too big for your shoes

I've been down on the rock so long

I seem to wear a permanent screw, yeah
I've been down on the rock so long
I seem to wear a permanent screw
But I'm gonna stare in the sun
Let the rays shine in my eyes
I'm gonna take a just a one step more
Cause I feel like bombing a church, now
Now that you know that the preacher is lying

So who's gonna stay at home
When, when the freedom fighters are fighting
Talkin' blues, talkin' blues
They say your feet is just too big for your shoes, whoa
Talkin' blues, keep on, talkin' blues
They say, you hear what they say, didn't you hear?

Cold ground was my bed last night
Rock stone, rock stone, rock stone was my pillow
Cold ground was my bed last night
And rock was my pillow too

Sayin talkin' blues, talkin' blues
I seem to wear a permanent, permanent screw
Talkin' blues, talkin' blues
They say your feet is just too big for your shoes
