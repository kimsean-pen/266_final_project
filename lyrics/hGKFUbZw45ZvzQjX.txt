Stay alone in my room
Every moment passing too soon
Watch the candles burn into the night
Fall into a dream
Wake up and everything's the same
A second older but alone just like a child

If you just give me a sign
To live and not to die

Then i could see a little light
I could find some piece of mind
I don't know where you are
Maybe near or maybe far
I just need a little light

Hear a clock ticking
On a life that could have meaning
If i could find the love light in your eyes
See a million people
Everyone's so lonely
But we don't have to be alone tonight

Then i could see a little light
I could find some piece of mind
I don't know where you are
Maybe near or maybe far
I just need a little light

If i could see a little light
If i could find some piece of mind
If you just give me a sign
I could see a little light
I don't know where you are
Maybe near or maybe far
I could see a little light
If i could see a little light
I could see a little light

Stay alone in my room
Every moment passing too soon
Watch the candles burn into the night
