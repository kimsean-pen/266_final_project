Ain't never felt this way
Can't get enough, so stay with me
It's not like we got big plans
Let's drive around town, holdin hands

And you need to know
You're the only one, alright
Alright
And you need to know
That you keep me up, all night
All night

Oh, my heart hurts so good
I love you, babe, so bad
So bad
Oh, my heart hurts so good
I love you, babe, so bad
So bad

Man cool it on my clothes
Mad woman you get close, to me
Slow dance these summer nights
Our disco ball's my kitchen light

And you need to know
That no body can take your place
Your place

And you need to know
That I'm hella obsessed with your face
Your face
Oh, my heart hurts so good

I love you, babe, so bad
So bad
Oh, my heart hurts so good
I love you, babe, so bad
So bad
And you need to know

You're the only one, alright
Alright
And you need to know
That you keep me up all night
All night
Oh, my heart hurts so good
I love you, babe, so bad
So bad
Oh, my heart hurts so good
I love you, babe, so bad
So bad Oh, my heart hurts So bad
