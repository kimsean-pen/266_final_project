We have short time to stay
Our night is slipping far away
Caught up within bad memories
Our growth seems certain to decay

Now this feeling's so alive
But, as you or anything, we die
We die

Let's stay here for a while
Eyes so round and bright we gently smile
Live for the moment, not the past
Why do we always fall so fast?
