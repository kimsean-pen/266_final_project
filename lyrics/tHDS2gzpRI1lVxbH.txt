I'm an exception
It's hard to accept
Because I try to be happy
But then I forget
They tell me I need to chill, man
It's all in your head
Maybe I'm paranoid

I don't wanna be myself
It's making me so unwell, yeah
I don't wanna be myself
Just wanna be someone else, yeah

And once I fucked up
Don't know where we went
'Cause I've been living on soda and cheap cigarettes
Maybe when I was a kid
I was stroked to my head
Yeah, that would make some sense, yeah

I don't wanna be myself
It's making me so unwell, yeah
I don't wanna be myself
Just wanna be someone else, yeah

I don't wanna be myself
It's making me so unwell, yeah
I don't wanna be myself
Just wanna be someone else, yeah

I don't wanna be myself
It's making me so unwell, yeah
I don't wanna be myself
Just wanna be someone else, yeah
