I can never be all that you want from me
And I am broken, I will fail you constantly
There's nothing left that we can say
Nothing gold can ever stay
It's easier to run away
It's easier to curse than pray
No sacrifice, now burn it at the altar
I can never be all that you want from me
And I am broken, I will fail you constantly
Return to the safety of disbelief
You want to lay your doubt aside
Faith has nowhere left to hide
I'm the one with hollow eyes
I'm the one you now despise
I can never be all that you want from me
And I am broken, I will fail you constantly
Return to the way that you bleed for me
Return to the safety of disbelief
For you and all your dreams
I feel nothing
(And I am broken, I will fail you constantly)
Return to the way that you bleed for me
Return to the safety of disbelief
I can never be all that you want from me
And I am broken, I will fail you constantly
Return to the safety of disbelief
I can never be all that you want from me
And I am broken, I will fail you constantly
Return to the way that you bleed for me
Return to the safety of disbelief
For you and all your dreams
I feel nothing
