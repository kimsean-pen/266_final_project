Why always me who has to put you in your place?
I'll never forget what you put me through and all those selfish nights
Only dogs get put down; the bitch of living
Too cruel to be left alive

I'm just trying to be what you want me to be, and it never ends
And it's pain again
Mark this day as the last I feel this way, for the comfort
The repetition is my vice, my poison
Only dogs get put down; the bitch of living
Too cruel to be left alive

I'm just trying to be what you want me to be, and it never ends
And it's pain again
Pain again
I always seem to find you again

Cut-throats are made of us
No time to waste
Actors, liars, and fakes
It's too dangerous for me to leave you alive
You're a hazard, stifle yourself and all of your surroundings
You need to be put down
Put down

Trust is a motherfucker
