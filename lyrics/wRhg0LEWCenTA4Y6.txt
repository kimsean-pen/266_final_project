Sometimes I just feel like I'm,
Hopelessly devoted to this depression in my head.
It's been stuck in there since I was just a kid,
Now I'm almost a man,
Learning things about myself I wish that I never did.
And I'm sick of hating this person that I've become
And I'm sick of always feeling like I'm all that I've got.
I'm so tired of singing the same old songs,
So tired of feeling so alone

People say you've just got to try and move on,
But these concrete shoes I've been wearing are overbearing.
These days,
I can't stop wishing my life away.
Is there anybody out there that could fix me?
Shit!

I hate to see my parents in me.
They're the last things I ever wanted to be.
But as I took up the drinking things only got worse,
My inhibitions were dropped,
But the sadness still hurts.
There's a hole in my head and a hole in my chest,
That can't be soothed by any bottle or sedative

Just got to try and move on,
But these concrete shoes I've been wearing are overbearing.
These days,
I can't stop wishing my life away.
Is there anybody out there that could fix me?
People say you've just got to try and move on,
But these concrete shoes I'm wearing are overbearing.
These days,
I can't stop wishing my life away.
I don't think there's anybody out there that could fix me

I couldn't fix me.
You couldn't fix me.
They couldn't fix me.
I think I'm the only one who could fix me
