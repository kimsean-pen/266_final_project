Lines form on my face and hands
Lines form from the ups and downs
I'm in the middle without any plans
I'm a boy and I'm a man

I'm eighteen and I don't know what I want
Eighteen, I just don't know what I want
Eighteen, I got to get away
I got to get out of this place
I'll go runnin' in outer space, woh yeah

I've got a baby's brain and an old man's heart
Took eighteen years to get this far
Don't always know what I'm talking about
Feels like I'm living in the middle of doubt

'Cause I'm eighteen, I get confused every day
Eighteen, I just don't know what to say
Eighteen, I've got to get away

Lines form on my face and my hands
Lines form from the left and right
I'm in the middle, the middle of life
I'm a boy and I'm a man

I'm eighteen and I like it
Yes, I like it
Woh, I like it, love it, like it, love it
Eighteen, eighteen, eighteen, eighteen, woh!

And I like it
I'm eighteen and I like it
I'm eighteen yes, I like it
I'm eighteen woh, I like it
I'm eighteen and I like it

I'm eighteen woh, I like it, love it
Like it, love it, like it, love it, like it
I'm eighteen
Like it, love it, like it, love it, like it
I'm eighteen

I like it
I'm eighteen
I like it
I'm eighteen
I like it

I'm eighteen
I'm eighteen
I'm eighteen
I'm eighteen
I'm eighteen
I'm eighteen
