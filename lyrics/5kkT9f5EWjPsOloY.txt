Jesse there's a curve in the road
And its shaped just like a toucan's nose
If you can't then you'll Clementine
How we're layn'in spaces in time.

This road is humble
This road is double
And this road troubles neath the line
and shaped like a "W" with a tortured spine

And I can't say
That I'm on the way of luck this time
but I'm bettin' on the curve with the master's dime

Jesse there's a curve in that song
and its shaped like a moan that's almost gone
and I can't find the Clementine
but I'll play again, just in time

This road is whole, lord
This road is dull, lord
And this road troubles in a state so blind
and starin' like a weasel that makes headlines

But I can't say that I really want
anything this time
but I'm turnin' down the road with some heavy line

Jesse there's a curve in the road
And its shaped just like a toucan's nose(?)
And I can't find my Clementine
how we'll lay in spaces just in time.
