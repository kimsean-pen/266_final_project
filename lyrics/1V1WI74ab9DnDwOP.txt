I'm never coming back
I'm never giving in
I'll never be the shine in your spit

I disconnect the act
I disconnect the dots
I disconnect the me in me

You're mistaken, it's you that's faking
Living, breathing and dying too
This message is for anyone
Who dares to hear a fool

You can't bring me back
You can't bring me back
Because I gave it all back to you

Through sacred alleys, the living wrecks, yeah
Wreak their havoc upon this world
Disenchanted, the romantics
Body, face and soul of you
Is gone down that deep black hole

Destroy the mind, destroy the body
But you cannot destroy the heart
Destroy the mind, destroy the body
But you cannot destroy the heart

And you
You make me so I need to disconnect
And you make it so real
I don't need your love to disconnect

To runaround kids in get-go cars
Vaseline afterbirths, neon coughs
Galaxies full of nobodies
Giving us the farewell runarounds

I took a Virgin Mary Axe to his sweet baby Jane
Lost my innocence to a no good girl
Scratch my face with anvil hands
Coil my tongue around a bumblebee mouth

And I give it all back to you
I give it all back to you, yeah
I give it all back to you
For you

No way, I don't need it
I don't need your love to disconnect
And you make it, so real
I don't need your love to disconnect

No way, no way
No way to disconnect
And you make it so real
I don't need your love to disconnect
No way, no way
No way to disconnect
Yeah
