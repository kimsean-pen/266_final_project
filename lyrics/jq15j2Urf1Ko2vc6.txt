And it is so strange
With these eyes out into darkness
And it is so strange
All they want to do is sleep
And it is so strange
They want to sleep through silence
And it is so strange
'Cause I am wide awake

And it is so strange
How all this could be over
If you would walk in
If you put me to rest
And it is so strange
That my voice seems to've gone quiet
And even stranger still
That I never will be found

All I want to do
Is to drift away
Hush-a-bye baby
All I want to do is go to sleep
To sleep, to sleep
