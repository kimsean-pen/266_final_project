That year
It wasn't me who wanted
I was just a happening
Uncurling in your garden

Search for a nightcap
The world looks so funny to me
Maps misguided
The patterns are empty

Feels near
That time I begged your pardon
Goodbye to righteous
No need to alarm them

Opposite middle
Twisting tales beneath me
Bend beyond
The light is feeling

Once fear
Now the meek can will me
I was just shaking
The others saw through me

Untapped minding
The past is still thinking
Maps misguided
The patterns are empty

Finding hours
They can heal me
Clear reflections
They believe
Sweet daylight
I can see through
Strange hour
Curls in you
