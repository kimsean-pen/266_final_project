Ah, dance
Let me see you move, come on
Dance
(Come on) Let me see you move

Baby, love never felt so good
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby

Love never felt so fine
And I doubt if it's ever mine
Not like you hold me, hold me

And the night's gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta sing, can't believe
I can't take it cause
Baby

Every time I love you
In and out my life
In and out baby
Tell me

If you really love me
It's in and out my life
In and out baby
So baby

Love never felt so good
Mm, baby
Love never felt so fine
And I doubt if it's ever mine

Not like you hold me, hold me
Ooh baby
Love never felt so good (so good)
And I doubt if it ever could

Not like you hold me, hold me
In the night through the thick and thin
Gotta fly, gotta sing, can't believe
I can't take it cause

Baby
Every time I love you
It's in and out my life
In and out baby

Tell me
If you really love me
It's in and out my life
In, out baby

Baby
Love never felt so good
Oh, oh, uh huh
Break it down

Dance
Let me see you move (come on)
Let me see you move
Dance with me

Come on, come on
Let me see, let me see you move

Gotta fly, gotta sing, can't believe

Driving me crazy
