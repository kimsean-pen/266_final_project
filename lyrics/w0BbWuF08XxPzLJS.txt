Well, the time will come
when the wind will shout
all stripped down
all stripped down
and all the sinners know
what i'm talking about
all stripped down
all stripped down
when all the creatures of the world
are gonna line up at the gate
And you better be on time
and better not be late
all stripped
all stripped down
Well you know in your heart
what you gotta bring
all stripped down
all stripped down
no big mink coat
no diamond ring
all stripped down
all stripped down
Well take off your paint
take off your rouge
all stripped down
all stripped down
let your backbone flip
and let your spirit shine thru
i want you all stripped
all stripped
all stripped down
All the men we got
well they're goin' down the drain
all stripped down
all stripped down
and when i see your sadness
on a river of shame
all stripped down
all stripped down
You got to raise up
both the quick and the dead
all stripped down
all stripped down
with no shoes on your feet
no hat on your head
i want you all stripped down
all stripped
all stripped down
Ain't nothin' in my heart
but fire for you
all stripped down
all stripped down
with my rainy hammer
and a heat that's true
i want you all stripped
all stripped
all stripped down
