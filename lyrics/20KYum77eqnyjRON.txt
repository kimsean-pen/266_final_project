It's been a long time, so long
There's only one life I know (I know)
But I have my own mind
I'll say so if it seems right

(Hey rush out)

I see your warm face with the soft mouth
But it speaks something else (else)
I'll take my chances with the cast down
We can feel the air

Rush out, out from the center
Not like one side is any better
Stand up as they've been preaching
My best theory is already in me
(already in me) In me

(We can feel, we can feel the air
Rush out)

So many questions
And the answers come back unanswered
(unanswered)
Let's hold the old script
It's a new twist
You can feel the air

Rush out, out from the center
Not like one side is any better
Stand up as they've been preaching
My best theory is already in me
(already in me)

In a lonely real place
Neither part nor mistake
Not what you had with your time

My doubt seems fine, my true desire
My threat, my appetite

My true desire

I feel the air!

Rush out, out from the center
Not like one side is any better
Stand up and escape and breach it
My best theory is already in me
(already in me)
Rush, out from the center
Not like one side is any better
Stand up (stand up)
As they've been preaching
My best theory is already in me
(In me)
