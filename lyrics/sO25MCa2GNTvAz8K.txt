Mother Europa calling me

Pondering what star will bring me where,
when will I get there,
who will I find,
calling out my name.

Across the forever night,
take me to see her,
the monolith,
that knows the tales,
dwelling inside man,
telling of the names,
dwelling inside me.

Take me to see her,
the monolith,
that knows the tales,
of my own misery,
crying out now.

Europa please,
hear my own screams,
how long will I.

How will I move on
How will I move on

Please take me again,
crossing over,
the nomad in roam,
searching on.

Stifled thoughts.
No way crossing over.
No way.
No way crossing over.
Take me away.

I'm Pondering what star will bring me where,
when will I get there,
who will I find,
calling out my name in the open.

The monolith,
dwelling inside man,
through the open.
