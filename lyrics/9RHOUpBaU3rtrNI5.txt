When the world gets too heavy, put it on my back
I will be your levy
You are taking me apart, like bad glue
On a get well card

It was always you falling for me
Now there's always time calling for me
I'm the light blinking at the end of the road
Blink back to let me know

I'm a fly that is trapped in a web
But I'm thinking that my spider's dead
Lonely, lonely little life
I could kid myself in thinking that I'm fine

It was always you falling for me
Now there's always time calling for me
I'm the light blinking at the end of the road
Blink back to let me know

That I'm skin and bone
Just a king and a rusty throne
Oh, the castle's under siege
But the sign outside says, "Leave me alone"

It was always you falling for me
Now there's always time calling for me
I'm the light blinking at the end of the road
Blink back to let me know

(It was always you)
Blink back to let me know
(It was always you)
