1]
From the corner of 3rd and Washington
You can't see where your brother went
Out somewhere past the beat cops
And beautiful women who work for the government
They walk by in air-conditioned tunnels
That are a cut above the street
While I sweat in my hot coffee
And daydream about how we might meet

Your mother asked for a picture
She says "today's your birthday"
In some strung out western stutter
Making all the world her ashtray
She adjusts her aviators
With an absent shaking hand
Tilts the camera forward forty-five degrees
And calls out modeling commands

When we used to go to parties
You'd spend an hour before the mirror
And I'd drink your gin
And ask about your high school souvenirs
Tacked on the wall above the bed
An old Inkjet collage
But you were never much for talking
So I knelt to your garage

We'd walk the three blocks westbound
In the moonlit Philly fall
And the party would be grand
All our friends would grin with pride
All our friends would be so drunk
And have such pleasant things to say
And at last, we'd see each other
In the way that we had dreamed to be seen

Those nights your house kept secret
We'd stumble up the stairs
My hands tore through your records
While your hands unpinned your hair
The both of us still green enough
To remove the other's clothes
A quiet signal of devotion
That I am happy to have known
