Mmmmm
Put me on the train
Send me back my home
Couldn't live without you

When I tried to roam
Put me by the window
Let me see outside
Look at all the places
Where all my family died
Where all my family died
Where all my family died

Where all my family died
Leave me by the churchyard
Leave me on my own
The storm will come and take me

Back to my old home
Put me by the window
Let me see outside
Look at all the places
Where all my family died
Where all my family died
Where all my family died

Where all my family died
Mmm, ah-ah
Put me on the train (.ain)
Send me back to my home
Put me on the train (.ain)
Send me back to my home
Put me on the train (.ain)
Send me back to my home
Put me on the train (.ain)
Send me back to my home
Put me on the train (.ain)
Send me back to my home
Put me on the train (.ain)
Send me back to my home
