You've got a troubled soul
I've got a troubled mind
You wanna highlight the faults
Why can't you leave them behind
Tried to fix the cracks
It's still leaking in
This will never end
If we don't begin
We burn it up from both sides
Our fuzz is fuel to the fire

Reading between the lines
Getting tired of
Reading between the lines
Colour outside the lines
Bring the tirades
Open up, let it out

Speak your mind
Or forever bite your tongue
(Our love's hidden in between the lines)
When your heart's not there
It's hard to sing along
(Our love's hidden in between the lines)
(Our love's hidden in between the lines)

You like the sun
But you just can't face it
I like the good things in life
But I don't know how to taste it
This vicious circle should
Have been a circle of trust
Trying to avoid, what now comes down to a must
I'll never finish this book
You always turn out the light

Reading between the lines
Getting tired of
Reading between the lines
Colour outside the lines
Bring the tirades
Open up, let it out

Speak your mind
Or forever bite your tongue
(Our love's hidden in between the lines)
When your heart's not there
It's hard to sing along
(Our love's hidden in between the lines)
Speak your mind
Or forever bite your tongue
(Our love's hidden in between the lines)
When your heart's not there
It's hard to sing along
(Our love's hidden in between the lines)
(Our love's hidden in between the lines)
(Our love's hidden in between the lines)

Our love's hidden in between the lines
Our love's hidden in between the lines
