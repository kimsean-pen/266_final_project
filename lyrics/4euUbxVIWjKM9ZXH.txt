I'm sick, and I've felt this way for some time now
I'm so fed up with the daily grind
I'm trying to find relief
If you feel this way then clap your hands
Ever thought this was a backward land?
What is making people mean?
A bad scene

Now that I've got my motives straight and I am thinking clearly
I'll sneak up to your window with my senses open wide

I'm tired, on my shoulders weighing heavily
Is the full responsibility for your troubles and your charms
Your betrayal goes around with me
Like the sword in some old tragedy
It is sticking in my back
People laugh

Now that I've got my motives straight and I am thinking clearly
I'll sneak up to your window with my senses open wide

I never really thought it would be like this
I know it's kind of hard but I'm glad that it is
I'm glad

Now that I've got my motives straight and I am thinking clearly
I'll sneak up to your window with my senses open wide

I never really thought it would be like this
I know it's kind of hard but I'm glad that it is
I'm glad
