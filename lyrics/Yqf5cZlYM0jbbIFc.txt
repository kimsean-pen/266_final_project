Please don't reproach me
For how empty my life has become.
I don't know what really happened,
I watched your disappointment
At being misunderstood.

I forgive you.

Oh something metal
Tearing my stomach out
If you think ill of me.

Can you,
Can you forgive me?
Forgive me.
Can you?
Can you forgive me too?
Too?

I tried to learn your language,
But fell asleep,
Half-undressed,
Unrecognisable to myself.
