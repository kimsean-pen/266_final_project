Show the blessed I got devil's blood
Got the feeling that I should've run
People laughing on to this day, 'cause
I got a made mind, leading astray

Can i, come in, take you on
Can i, come in, take you on
It's about time, yeah
It's about time

Is the rebel gonna notice
When I take the other way?
I can hold you for the time
But I can't stand another day

It's too easy I think every time
I am the man for the perfect crime
Who's gonnan see it?
Who's gonna know?
I tell myself in the final blow

Can i, come in, take you on
Can i, come in, take you on
It's about time, yeah
It's about time

Is the rebel gonna notice
When I take the other way?
I can hold you for the time
But I can't stand another day

Can i, come in, take you on
Can i, come in, take you on

Is the rebel gonna notice
When I take the other way?
I can hold you for the time
But I can't stand another day
