Cause I need you
Can't you see that I need you?
Cause I need you (I need you)
Can't you see that I need you? (I need you)

Baby it's you I want,
So stop wasting my time
And baby it's you I need,
So please make up your mind
It's time to choose

I don't wanna say
I don't wanna say
I don't wanna say
Say goodbye to you
I don't wanna play

Play this game with you (this game with you, this game with you)

Cause I need you

Everytime you stay (every time you stay)

Oh baby it's you I need,
So please make up your mind (please make up your mind)
It's time to choose
