Lie half asleep
You still find a way to stumble back to me
Stuck on the edge between reality
We could be

On our own with just the bed posts watching
In positions only sheets can see

In the morning I'll be broken hearted

You only want me when the lights low
Now that your drinking will you say you need me?

You only touch me with the door closed
I get you off and then you're gone gone gone

Don't leave me in the dark
Don't leave me in the dark
Wide awake
The blackness cannot hold me
They say shadows can't be lonely
Should I stay?
This feeling's just too good to leave you're bittersweet but we could be

On our own with just the bed posts watching
In positions only sheets can see
In the morning I'll be broken hearted

You only want me when the lights low
Now that your drinking will you say you need me?
You only touch me with the door closed
I get you off and then your gone gone gone
Don't leave me in the dark
Don't leave me in the dark
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me in the dark
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me in the dark
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
You wanna x us apart
You only want me when the lights low
Now that your drinking will you say you need me?
You only touch me with the door closed
I get you off and then your gone gone gone
You only want me when the lights low
Whoo
You only touch me with the door closed
Whoo
