Let me love you,
Let me be around,
I promise you, I won't make a sound
Cause the wind is blowing hard you see,
we take a ride just you and me.

Let's go down to the south of France
But we can love,
I think there is a chance,
Go down for the holiday to live those happy thoughts again...

How are you gonna run at the speed of sounds,
Ooh, ooh wonder child,
How are you gonna breathe if you're underground,
How many times will you try?
How are you gonna walk at the rainbow's edge
Ooh, ooh wonder child,
Oooh wonder child,
Everything comes to an end,

I get to you at the speed of sounds,
Really fast when you're on the run,
Cause the worse close in on us,
A second later, we're on the bus,
You're so fine and
I love you so,
So beautiful but I have to know is it real or is it just a game?!
Take a ride what come back the same,

How are you gonna run at the speed of sounds,
Ooh, ooh wonder child,
How are you gonna breathe if you're underground,
How many times will you try?
How are you gonna walk at the rainbow's edge
Ooh, ooh wonder child,
Oooh wonder child,
Every thing comes to an end,

And if I could be with you,
I keep on wonder why,
If this whole escapade
Is it worth all these times?!
And if I could be with you,
I keep on wonder why,
If this how asked to pay,
Is it worth ooh (ooh, ooh),

How are you gonna run at the speed of sounds,
Ooh, ooh wonder child,
How are you gonna breathe if you're underground,
How many times will you try?
How are you gonna walk at the rainbow's edge
Ooh, ooh wonder child,
Oooh wonder child,
Every thing comes to an end,

If I could be with you,
I keep on wonder why,
If this whole escapade
Is it worth all these times
And If I could be with you I keep on wonder why
If this whole escapade

Ooh, ooh wonder child
Every thing comes to an end!
