Well I had 1000 Ways
to get through 100 days
and not one of them is good,
that's what I've done.
A beacon in the dark,
drinking whiskey in the park,
underneath the blazing unrelenting sun

but when my baby,
when my baby smiles at me
I go to rehab [x2]

I'm always in the race
to be first out of my face,
change I know I should,
I know I must.
But I couldn't care less
when I regain consciousness
and I'm standing upright,
naked on the bus

but when my baby,
when my baby smiles at me
I go to rehab [x4]
