Faded and worn at the seams
A psychotropic wanderlust, sick and laughing
Their words bear their teeth into the wall
I promised I would rid the world of feral animals

See you smiling with your feet up like your hero's
You'd offer yourself to save your reputation
Strong and fearless and deprived just like your heroes
Are you sharpening your sword, well you'll fade out anyway

Why'd you say
Why'd you say that you'd come right back for my love, for my faith?
All the promises you made never realized
Why'd you say
Why'd you say that you'd come right back for my love, for my strength?
All the promises you made never realized

Fill the air with what you like
Another weekend massacre of opinion
Don't be afraid of the knife, sometimes you have
To cut the limb to survive

I see you smiling with your feet up like your heroes
You'd offer yourself to save your reputation
Strong and fearless and deprived just like your heroes
Are you sharpening your sword, well you'll bleed out anyway

Why'd you say
Why'd you say that you'd come right back for my love, for my faith?
All the promises you made never realized
Why'd you say
Why'd you say that you'd come right back for my love, for my strength?
All the promises you made never realized

You got to love the madness of the feeling
Don't have to rush the freshness of beginning
You got to get back up and face your demons
Don't ever be afraid of starting over
