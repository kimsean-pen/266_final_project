Treat me kind, keep me safe
Show me love, I'll embrace
If you take me home, where I was born
I'll find peace of mind, somehow

Give me love, show me grace
Give me time, and a little space
If you take me back, where I belong
I'll find peace of mind, somehow

Look for light for your conception
Lay me down for your inspection

Somehow we'll find away
Sometime but not today
There's somthin' I need to say
Sometimes
Somehow we'll find away
I wish this was yesterday
And maybe tomorrow
I'll remember

Sometimes, sometimes

Give me hope, in life I pray
It's good when I'm bad, I'm sorry to say
When I feel you inside, deep within me
I'll find peace of mind, somehow

I'm a living breathing contradiction
Can't go through this crucifixion
Sacrifice love for affection
There's pain in pleasures resurrection

Somehow we'll find away
Sometime but not today
There's somthin' I need to say
Sometimes
Somehow we'll find away
I wish this was yesterday
And maybe tomorrow
I'll remember

Sometimes, sometime

After the rain (after the rain)
Then comes the sun (then comes the sun)
We will be one (be one), again

An aphrodisiac rejection
Immaculate is our conception

Somehow we'll find away
Sometime but not today
There's somthin' I need to say
Sometimes
Somehow we'll find away
I wish this was yesterday
And maybe tomorrow
I'll remember

Sometimes (somehow we'll find away)
Sometimes (sometime but not today)
Sometimes (there's somthin' I need to say)
Sometimes (sometimes)
Treat me kind (Somehow we'll find away)
Keep me safe (I wish this was yesterday)
Show me love (And maybe tomorrow)
Sometimes (I'll remember)
