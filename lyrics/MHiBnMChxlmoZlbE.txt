It takes me writing a song
To know that I took it all in
Could be the best day of my life
Wouldn't be done til I sing
Oh and it's not that I like to boast
Not that I've got the most
Memorable of things to say
I don't want to forget the way
I feel in this moment
Cos here I am fearless
Here I am weightless
Here I am unbreakable
Here I am the greatest
It takes lietimes for some
To know what they're really here for
Consider me a lucky one
Known since the day I was born
Oh and it's not like I would run around
And speak with my voice up loud
I am happiest when I'm
Surrounded by the best of my friends
That's as simple as it gets
Cos here I am fearless
Here I am weightless
Here I am unbreakable
Here I am the greatest
Here I am soaring
Here I am flying
My love unconditional
Happiness undying
Nothing you could do
Nothing you could say
I am here at one
My light will never fade
And all that time I needed this change
It takes lifetimes for some
To know what they're really here for
Consider me a lucky one
Known since the day I was born
Cos here I am fearless
Here I am weightless
Here I am unbreakable
Here I am the greatest
Here I am soaring
Here I am flying
My love unconditional
Happiness undying
