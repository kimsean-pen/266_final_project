We've been divided by an ocean
Had a hundred things in motion
Said you barely reconize me (clap)
Yeah, I've been gone for quite a while
But can we just reconcile
No, I never meant to leave you
I was busy but I promise you the next time
You won't feel like I forgot about you (clap)
I know it's far but just remenber
I'll be back home in November
I won't miss you 'til I see the smoke
Call it blowback (clap), call it blowback call it blowback, call it blowback
Call it blowback (clap), call it blowback, call it blowback, call it blowback, call it blowback (clap)
Ooh it seems like a mighty long time
Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby
Ooh it seems like a mighty long time
Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby
Ooh it seems like a mighty long time
Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby
Ooh it seems like a mighty long time
Your mind would disagree, I could tell
When you smile does it let you wish me well?
Bore a cyclone every time you exhale
I cut off the ground and now I'm unbounded
But miss you around it
That's why you should come and
Sit me all about the mountains
You used to kiss me like your lips
Have caught fire, but no
That smoke gets my eyes
Blowback (clap), call it blowback
Call it blowback, call it blowback
Call it blowback, call it blowback
Call it blowback, call it blowback
Ooh, it seems like a mighty long time
Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby
Ooh, it seems like a mighty long time
Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby
Ooh, it seems like a mighty long time
Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby
Ooh, it seems like a mighty long time
Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby
Shoo-bop, shoo-bop
Hello stranger
(Ooh) It seems so good to see you back again
How long has it been?
Ooh, it seems like a mighty long time
Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby
Ooh, it seems like a mighty long time
Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby
Ooh, it seems like a mighty long time
Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby
Ooh, it seems like a mighty long time
Shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby
