This is the beginning of the record you like
Over and over, over and over
This is the beginning of the record you like
Over and over, over and over

Breaking up, fading out
Holding on until tomorrow
Shake it off, turn around
It won't be long, till it's a brand new day

This is the beginning, the beginning
This is the beginning of the rest of your life
This is the beginning, the beginning
This is the beginning of the rest of your life

You better get it, get it, ge-ge-get it, get it, right, right
Get it, get it, ge-ge-get it, get it, right, right
Get it, get it, ge-ge-get it, get it, right, right
Get it, get it, ge-ge-get it, get it, right, right

That was then, this is now
Here we go, starting over
You decide, change your mind
Miracles happen every day

This is the beginning, the beginning
This is the beginning of the rest of your life
This is the beginning, the beginning
This is the beginning of the rest of your life

You better get it, get it, ge-ge-get it, get it, right, right
Get it, get it, ge-ge-get it, get it, right, right
Get it, get it, ge-ge-get it, get it, right, right
Get it, get it, ge-ge-get it, get it, right, right

Change the world, change your mind
We defy space and time
Change the world, change your mind
We defy space and time

Change the world, change your mind (You better, ge-ge, ge-ge)
We defy space and time (Ge-ge, right, right)
Change the world, change your mind (Ge-ge, ge-ge)
We defy space and time (Ge-ge, right, right)

This is the beginning, the beginning
This is the beginning of the rest of your life
This is the beginning, the beginning
This is the beginning of the rest of your life

This is the beginning, the beginning
This is the beginning of the rest of your life
This is the beginning, the beginning
This is the beginning of the rest of your life
