IT'S SUMMER!

The heat is blazing like the 4th of July
I got the air con' on and its blasting on high
So just grab something cool and jump in your ride
Pick up everybody I'll be waiting outside

Woah-oh!
The summer's not hot without you
I hope I get to see ya
Woah-oh-oh!
The summer won't start without you

The temperature is 99
And I can get much hotter
So come on over Romeo
And vamos a la playa
Woah-oh-oh!
The summer's not hot
The summer won't start without you

The summer's not hot
The summer's not hot till you show up
The summer's not hot
The summer's not hot till you show up
Till you, till you show up, show up

IT'S SUMMER!

You're the reason that I jumped in the pool
'Cause you're so hot that I gotta get cooled off
And all your friends will bring 'em along
Hurry up and meet me there's a party going on

Woah-oh!
The summer's not hot without you
I hope I get to see ya
Woah-oh-oh!
The summer won't start without you

The temperature is 99
And I can get much hotter
So come on over Romeo

And vamos a la playa
Woah-oh-oh!
The summer's not hot
The summer won't start without you

Did you show up?
Did you show up?
Did you show up?
Did you show up?

In my heart it's freezing
I am wearing a bikini
And I now the sun is beating down
Where ever you may be

The summer's not hot to me
The summer's not hot to me
The summer's not hot to me
Till you show up
The summer's not hot
The summer's not hot till you show up
The summer's not hot
Till you, till you show, show, show up

Woah-oh!
The summer's not hot without you
I hope I get to see ya
Woah-oh-oh!
The summer won't start without you
The temperature is 99
And I can get much hotter
So come on over Romeo
And vamos a la playa
Woah-oh-oh!
The summer's not hot
The summer won't start without you
The summer's not hot to me
The summer's not hot to me
No matter what the temperature is
The summer's not hot to me
It's summer's not hot to me
No matter what the temperature is
