She found a place to be
Where she can be free
A shelter from the havoc
Free from herself

She is of silk like milk skin
With a ghost on her back
She burns from the inside
So now she destroys
Again

She builds up, she tears down
Tears down from inside
I refuse to lose this war
I come back for more
Again!

And her aura
Is an aroma

The rain dampens your colours bright
Goddess of the morning light
I walk the desert floor
I know I've been here before

I withstand the northern wind
To shelter her from sin
This won't be an empty place
She will come back for more
Again!
