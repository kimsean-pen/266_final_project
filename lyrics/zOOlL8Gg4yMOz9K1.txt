Driving around
I just can't hear a sound
Cept my own wheels turning

Wasting a day
I'm just running away
From a heart that's burning
But I can't run forever

(CHORUS)
Yes, we're gonna fall in love
And it feels so right
Yes, we're gonna make love
Gonna be tonight
I can just imagine
Hugging and teasing and
Loving and squeezing all night

I've made up my mind
That he's gonna be mine
I'm so glad I waited, whoa, oh

Why did I try
To figure out why
Everything can't be anticipated
I can't wait to tell him

(CHORUS)

Oh, yes

Oh, oh, oh, yes
Teasing and loving
And squeezing all night

Ooh, yes
I can just imagine
Hugging and teasing and
Loving and squeezing all night

Oh, yes, we're gonna fall in love
And it feels so right
Yes, we're gonna make love
It's gonna be tonight

Ooh, yes, we're gonna fall in love
And it feels so right
Yes, we're gonna make love
It's gonna be tonight

Yes, we're gonna fall in love
And it feels so right
(Oh, baby, baby)
Yes, we're gonna make love
It's gonna be (gonna be)
(Gonna be) tonight

We're gonna fall in love
And it feels so right...
