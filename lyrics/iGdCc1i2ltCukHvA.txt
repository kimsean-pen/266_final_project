One, two, ready
Here we go

It ain't the gun
It's the man behind the trigger
Gets blood on his fingers
And runs
It ain't the lie
It's the way that the truth is denied

But if there is one thing that I'm guilty of
It's loving and giving when you take too much
If somebody asked how we died
Please look them straight in the eye

Call it suicide
Don't fabricate
Just tell them babe
It was suicide
Don't sugarcoat it
Just let them know

It ain't the knife
It's the way that you use it
How you abuse it in fights
It ain't about the life
You feel you were given
As long as you're living it right

If there is one thing that I'm guilty of
It's loving and giving when you take too much
If somebody asked how we died
Oh, you look them straight in the eye

Call it suicide
Don't fabricate
Just tell them babe
It was suicide
Don't sugarcoat it
Just let them know

You've been killing me softly
And finally the pain is too much
And I'm all out of whisky
To soak up the damage you've done

If there's anything I'm guilty of
It's loving you too much
If anybody asks how we died

Call it suicide
Don't fabricate
Just tell them babe
It was suicide
Don't sugarcoat it
Just let them know

Oh baby
Just let them know
Just...
