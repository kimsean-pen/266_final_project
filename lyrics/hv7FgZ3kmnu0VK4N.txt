She said go ahead and get out
Low down dirty beats
You better hold your tongue boy you better not even speak

You've been fooling
You've been fooling around
Then I go and get your train ticket cause you so out of line
Outta line (Outta line)
Outta line (Outta line)
I know something happened
When you came home half past nine
Outta line (Outta line)
You so outta line
You better come up with a quick plan to change this mind of mine

She said I see it all in your face
There ain't no fooling me you better hold your tongue
Or you better even not speak

Cause you been fooling
You've been fooling around
You you better go and get your train ticket cause you so out of line
You're outta line (Outta line)
You're outta line (Outta line)
I know something happened
When you came home half past nine
Outta line (Outta line)
You so outta line
You better come up with a quick plan to change this mind of mine

She said go ahead and get out low thief
You better hold your tongue
Boy you better not even speak

You've been fooling

Then I go and get your train ticket cause you so out of line
Outta line (Outta line)

I know something happened when you came home half past nine
Outta line (Outta line)
You so outta line
You better come up with a quick plan to change this mind of mine
