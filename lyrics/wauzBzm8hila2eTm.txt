True that I saw her hair like
The branch of a tree
Willow dancin' on air before covering me
Under garden and calicos
Over canopy dabbled long ago
True that love in withdrawal
Was the weepin' of me
That the sound of the
Saw must be known by the tree
Must be felt 'fore the fight, the call
Friendly fire, but that was long ago

But that's not tonight (Oh, oh)
When I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink inside (Oh, oh)
Your blinding light (Oh, oh)
Oh, that's not tonight (Oh, oh)
When you hold me tight (Oh, oh)
All the fire bright (Oh, oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright (Oh, oh)
Oh, hope that you're good to me
Oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Hope that you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)

With the war of the fire
My heart moves to its feet
Like the ashes of ash
I saw eyes in the heat
Feel it soft and as pure as snow
Fell in love with the fire long ago
With each love I could lose
I was never the same
Watch it still live in roofs
Be consumed by the flame
I was fixed on your hand of gold
Lay in waste of my lovin' long ago

That's not tonight (Oh, oh)
I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink inside (Oh, oh)
Your blinding light (Oh, oh)
Oh, that's not tonight (Oh, oh)
You hold me tight (Oh, oh)
All the fire bright (Oh, oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright, honey (Oh, oh)
Oh, hope that you're good to me
Oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Hope that you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)

So in awe there I stood as you
Licked off the grain
Though I've handled the wood
I still worship the flame
Long as amber of ember glows
All the wood that I'd loved is long ago

And it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
When I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink inside (Oh, oh)
Oh, your blinding light (Oh, oh)
Oh, that's not tonight (Oh, oh)
When you hold me tight (Oh, oh)
All the fire bright (Oh, oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright (Oh, oh)
Hope you're good to me
Hope you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Hope that you're good to me
Baby (Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, you're good to me
You're good to me (Oh, oh)
Hope that you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)
