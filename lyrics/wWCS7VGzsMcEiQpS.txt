By rubble snow, oranges you will find
There's a spider clinging to the vine
We demolish all the wars we fight
There's a serpent coiled by our side

But let's not go be surly

Shine a light upon the living sight
Often to hide away again
And the children in the rubble lay
Firing them from the sky today

But let's not go be surly

Crack a canyon laws the air today
Cross the nose of lovers in the fray
Drowning darkness yet their fit to say
A life of furlough, we're here to stay

But let's not go be surly
