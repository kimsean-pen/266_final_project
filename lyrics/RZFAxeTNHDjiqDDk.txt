I've been waitin' on the fault line
Let the needle take me on
I'll be standing with my dyin' bell
If you care to come along
Racin' with the risin' tide to my father's door
Racin' with the risin' tide to my father's door

I've been lyin' in the bright lights
See my shadow from below
Never wanted from another man
Never wanted from my own
Drownin' in the risin' tide in my father's door
Drownin' in the risin' tide in my father's door

Through a window to the last mile
Little picture on the wall
From the banks on the far side
See the lights come ashore
Racin' from the risin' tide to my father's door
Racin' from the risin' tide to my father's door
Racin' with the risin' tide to my father's door
