Look out the left the captain said
the lights down there, that's where we'll land
i saw a falling star burn up
above the las vegas sands
it wasn't the one that you gave to me
that night down south between the trailers
not the early one
that you can wish upon;
not the northern one
that guides in the sailors
Oh starbright, starbright
you've got the lovin' that i like, all right
turn this crazy bird around
i shouldn't have got on this flight tonight
You got the touch so gentle and sweet
but you've got that look so critical
now i can't talk to you baby
i get so weak
sometimes i think love is just mythical
up there's a heaven
down there's a town
blackness everywhere and little lights shine
oh, blackness, blackness dragging me down
come on light the candle in this poor heart of mine
Oh starbright, starbright
you've got the lovin' that i like, all right
turn this crazy bird around
i shouldn't hove got on this flight tonight
I'm drinking sweet champagne
got the headphones up high
can't numb you out
can't drum you out of my mind
they're playing "goodbye baby, baby goodbye,
ooh, ooh, love is blind"
up go the flaps, down go the wheels
i hope you got your heat turned on baby
i hope they finally fixed your automobile
i hope it's better when we meet again baby
Starbright, starbright
you got the lovin' that i like, all right
turn this crazy bird around
i shouldn't have got on this flight tonight
