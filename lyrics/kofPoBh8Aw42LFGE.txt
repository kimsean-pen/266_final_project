Making sad money
Take it all from me
I'll be getting paid again on Monday morning

I wish I had a falsetto just like Swae Lee
I wish I never found out about Gucci
I wish I knew the best things in life are free
I wish that I could get off this merry-go-round
I wish that I could afford to buy a brand new house
I wish that I didn't have to grow up at all

Making sad money
Take it all from me
I'll be getting paid again on Monday morning
Making sad money
Take it all from me
Blow it all just to feel like someone else

I'll be pretty 'til it kills me
Pretty even if it kills me
Say "I'm sorry" to my future self
I'll be pretty 'til it kills me
Pretty even if it kills me
I just want to feel like someone else

Pinky out, working my fingers to the bone
Working everyday just to sell my soul
Why's it got to be like that?
I know I'm not the only one
But spending money's so much fun
Why's it got to be like that?

Making sad money
Take it all from me
Blow it all just to feel like someone else

I'll be pretty 'til it kills me
Pretty even if it kills me
Say "I'm sorry" to my future self
I'll be pretty 'til it kills me
Pretty even if it kills me
Say "I'm sorry" to my future self
I'll be pretty till it kills me
Pretty even if it kills me
I just want to feel like someone else
