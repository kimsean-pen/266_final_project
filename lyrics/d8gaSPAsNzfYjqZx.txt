I Don't believe in the power of love
when the world is crumblin' down
and all the fears that you face in the mirror
ooh baby look out
they say

l.o.v. for you and me its just the way its gotta be
l.o.v. for you and me its just the way its gotta be

OOh when love come round

Love is a feelin'
Feel the words of love
Hold these words as the sweetest embrace
And Try come on try

I don't believe that you've given up on love
I'm hoping that you'll come around
It's the fear that you know but you gotta let go
So baby please don't doubt
they say

l.o.v. for you and me its just the way its gotta be
l.o.v. for you and me its just the way its gotta be

Love is a feelin'
Feel the words of love
Hold these words as the sweetest embrace
And Try come on try

OOh baby, you know, its gonna be alright
If you could find your way back home
I'd never ever ever let you go

Love is a feelin'
Feel the words of love
Hold these words as the sweetest embrace
Try come on try
