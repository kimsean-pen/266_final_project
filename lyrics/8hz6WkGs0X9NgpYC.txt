You do your best to write off my name try to control me
But that's gonna change if you look closer
You'll know what I mean you'll see the girl become a machine

I'll squeeze you, unease you, I'll freeze you, alarm you, disarm you,
I'll charm you, I'll block you, unlock you, I'll shock you

You wanna fight then we'll do it my way

So bring it on
I'll have you wrapped up around my finger
So bring it on when I start wearing you thin you'll know for sure
I don't wanna get dangerous put down your fists it's over with

So listen up 'cause you ain't messin' with me anymore

My invitation is not just a game
I gotta show you that I can't be claimed
I've got the power to turn this around 'cause it's my life and I wear the crown

All: I'll squeeze you, unease you, I'll freeze you, alarm you, disarm you,
I'll charm you, I'll block you, unlock you, I'll shock you

If you wanna fight then we'll do it my way

So bring it on
I'll have you wrapped up around my finger
So bring it on when I start wearing you thin you'll know for sure
I don't wanna get dangerous put down your fists it's over with

So bring it on
I'll have you wrapped up around my finger
So bring it on when I start wearing you thin you'll know for sure
I don't wanna get dangerous put down your fists it's over with

I won't loose sleep tonight 'cause I got what I need inside
It's time you see the light so spotlight shine your light down me on

I'll squeeze you, unease you, I'll freeze you, alarm you, disarm you,
I'll charm you, I'll block you, unlock you, I'll shock you

If you wanna fight then we'll do it my way

So bring it on
I'll have you wrapped up around my finger
So bring it on when I start wearing you thin you'll know for sure
I don't wanna get dangerous put down your fists it's over with

So bring it on
