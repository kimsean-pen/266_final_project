Early morning ray
Crashing upon my rooftop
And my brain
Woke up in my clothes
Feeling like I'm insane
The hours pass like days
Like days

And now you're on the firing squad
I throw my hands up, I surrender
I don't wanna be a fraud
I don't wanna be the pretender
And I was like a lightning rod
I was always your defender
We were both right and wrong
I throw my hands up, I surrender

I see your eyes
Hear your voice outside my window
Calling for me in a time of trouble
And you know I'd be there
Yes, you know I'd be there

And now you're on the firing squad
I throw my hands up, I surrender
I don't wanna be a fraud
I don't wanna be the pretender
And I was like your lightning rod
I was always your defender
We were both right and wrong
I throw my hands up, I surrender

Hand in sky, and I watch
At the street, cars rolling
As the wind is blowing
And there's no way of knowing now

And now you're on the firing squad
I throw my hands up, I surrender
I don't wanna be a fraud
I don't wanna be the pretender
And I was like a lightning rod
I was always your defender
We were both right and wrong
I throw my hands up, I surrender
