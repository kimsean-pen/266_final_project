You pulled a rainbow from my skull
And you said "look at that"
The fire you have within
Will never dim its climb

I will always run to you
Run to you upon the ground
On hollow bones [?]

Cormorant bird
Does not sing things
For days

The cloud pulled its curtain but the light stayed
Where you sat
In the blackberry bush where the bulbs
Shatter white

I will always run to you
Run to you upon the ground
On hollow bones [?]

Cormorant bird does not sing things
For days

(Ooohh Ooohh)
(La la la la)

New boat say nothing [?]
Nothing is no wings [?]
To the melody of our secret cormorant sins
