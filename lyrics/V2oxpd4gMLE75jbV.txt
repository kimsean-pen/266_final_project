If you know somebody
Who leaves their pain around
You still take all of it, and never throw it out
'cause you understand
If you know somebody
Who makes their hell by hand
Without a sense of touch
Crippled by a golden crutch
If you know somebody
Who raped themselves to death
And you made love to them
Beyond self-deprecation
Now you understand
If you know somebody
Who hates to sing along
But they still know all the words
But don't you force them out or they'll go insane

Everything is so sentimental

If you know somebody
Who cuts you with their tongue
They don't use any words
And listen 'cause it hurts
And then you understand
If you know somebody
Who loves to see you drown
In a pool of ecstasy
Seeming adoration of your effigy
If you know somebody
Who only dreams at night
Lackadaisically lost in reverie
You know you understand
If you know somebody
Who holds you by their side
But they love to pull away
Don't you pull them back or they'll go insane

Everything is so sentimental
Everything you say is still sentimental
When you look into my eyes it's influential
'Cause everything that's yours is mine is sentimental

Everything is so sentimental
Everything you say is still sentimental
When you look into my eyes it's influential
'Cause everything that's yours is mine is sentimental

When you look into my eyes
'Cause everything that's yours is mine
'Cause when you look into my eyes it's influential
'Cause everything that's yours is mine is sentimental
