All it takes is the main attraction
Scattered bones underneath the fashion
Lower life on a higher plane
That's what you want, that's what they're giving away

Photogenic, come and get it, you can have it, take it all
Schizophrenic, so sadistic, I don't know, I don't know
Politician, sick condition, dying for a curtain call
Counter culture, full of vultures, bet you think I'm what

We're going all out but get 'em up, get 'em up
And if they wanna take our picture tell 'em I don't give a fuck

No one needs you after all
That little social scene
Is just a hate machine
No one's here to take your call
And now your self-esteem
Ain't what it used to be
You inspire
The birth of ignorance
The death of innocence
Guess who's back and mad as hell
The nowhere kids that wished you well

Nowhere kids
Nowhere kids
Nowhere...

The new face of an old distraction
Another victim with the same reaction
A catastrophic contradiction at best
I know you're hanging onto zeros
'Cause you've got nothing left

Photogenic, come and get it, you can have it, take it all
Schizophrenic, so sadistic, I don't know, I don't know
Politician, sick condition, dying for a curtain call
Counter culture, full of vultures, bet you think I'm what

We're going all out but get 'em up, get 'em up
And if they wanna take our picture tell 'em I don't give a fuck

No one needs you after all
That little social scene
Is just a hate machine
No one's here to take your call
And now your self-esteem
Ain't what it used to be
You inspire
The birth of ignorance
The death of innocence
Guess who's back and mad as hell
The nowhere kids that wished you well

(Photogenic)
(Maybe so)
(Schizophrenic)
(I don't know)

Nowhere... No one needs you after all
That little social scene
Is just a hate machine
No one's here to take your call
And now your self-esteem
Ain't what it used to be
You inspire
The breath of ignorance
The death of innocence
Guess who's back and mad as hell
The nowhere kids that wished you well

Nowhere kids
Nowhere kids
Nowhere kids
Nowhere kids
Nowhere kids
Nowhere kids
Nowhere...
