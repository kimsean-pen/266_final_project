I hope this letter finds you well
Been in the desert for so long
Sometimes I see faces
Comin' out of the dark

But love won't be leaving
It won't be gone until I find a way
No, love won't be leaving
It won't be gone until I find a way

I draw my name in the sand
In the hope it'll find you

Because love won't be leaving
It won't be gone until I find a way

My desire is so strong
My desire is so strong
Sometimes I see faces
When I'm so alone

I draw my name in the sand
In the hope it'll find you
I draw my name in the sand
In the hope it'll find you

Because love won't be leaving
It won't be gone until I find a way
No, love won't be leaving
It won't be gone until I find a way

And I draw my name in the sand
In the hope it'll find you
Oh, I draw my name in the sand
In the hope it'll find you

Because love won't be leaving
It won't be gone until I find a way
No, love won't be leaving
It won't be gone until I find a way

Love won't be leaving
It won't be gone until I find a way
Oh, love won't be leaving
It won't be gone until I find a way
