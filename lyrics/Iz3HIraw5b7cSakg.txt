Dearest lover, read this letter
I can't pretend, I'm still in love
If my lips could say it better
I'd still be there, when you wake up

We used to be for real
But now you make me feel
Like I'll never be enough
You turned me on, then turned me off, oh

I want you to remember me
Every time you scream as the best you ever
I want you to remember me
In a lucid dream, as the best you ever

I hope you can find someone
Who will satisfy you like I did
Do all the stupid little things that
Never are as obvious

And all the things you miss
I seal 'em with a kiss
But I can't sign sincerely yours
I never was, I've never been

I want you to remember me
Every time you scream as the best you ever
I want you to remember me
In a lucid dream, as the best you ever
Best you ever

I've been wondering why
I tried so hard to win your love
I'm giving up
I don't wanna waste any more time
So goodbye

I want you to remember me
Every time you scream as the best you ever
I want you to remember me
In a lucid dream, as the best you ever

I want you to remember me
I want you to remember me
Best you ever
