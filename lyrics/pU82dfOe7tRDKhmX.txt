(Breathe in all the air)

Spinning, arms spread
Crushing the tops of mountains
With my hands
As I dive into the Pacific
I flood the shorelines

And I exhale
Causing the oceans' endless waves
As I emerge
Shaking the wreckage from my hair
With my hands

I want to breathe
Life into the Dead Sea

As this rainforest
Falls beneath my knees
I want to breathe
Life into the Dead Sea

Below, where is your boat?
You are slow, you are slow

I will play until the sky is black
Breathe in all the air
Exhale and choke the land with carbon
From where I stand
I can see the curvature of the Earth
And I want to make it flat

I will play, the sky is black
I will play, the sky is black.
