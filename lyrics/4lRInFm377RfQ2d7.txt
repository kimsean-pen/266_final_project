Oh yeah, yeah
Black jack, roulette
Losing high and low
She rolls the dice
She's as cold as ice
Turn a young man old

Comedy and tragedy
Entertainment or death
Like Sister Morphine
Hooked on her game
Time to place your bets

But if it wasn't for bad luck
I'd have no luck at all

Keep your eye on the money
Keep your eye on the dealer's hand
Keep your eye on the money
Keep your eye on the lady's hand

Queen of Hearts or Ace of Spades
Well, I'm dancing on the blade
Freak show, goin' broke
Crowd screams on for more

Electric shock won't bring you back
You've gone over the boards
Can't beat the clock, the deck is stacked
Crowd looks on in horror

Oh, if it wasn't for bad luck
I'd have no luck at all

Keep your eye on the money
Keep your eye on the dealer's hand
Keep your eye on the money
Keep your eye on the lady's hand

Keep your eye on the money
Keep your eye on the dealer's hand
Keep your eye on the money
Keep your eye on the lady, lady's hand

Keep your eye on the money
Keep your eye on the money
Keep your eye on the money
Keep your eye on the money
Keep your eye, keep your eye on the money
Keep your eye, keep your eye on the money
Keep your eye, keep your eye on the money
Keep your eye on the money
Keep your eye on the money
Keep your eye on the money
Keep your eye, keep your eye on the money
Keep your eye, keep your eye
