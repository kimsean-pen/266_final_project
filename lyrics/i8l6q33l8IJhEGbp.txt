Looking out
Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs

Get me out
Into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?

Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?

I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way

(That way) Why? Ho why?
(That way) Why? Ho why?

Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Cha, da, cha, sha, sha, sha, sha, sha (aah-ah)
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?
If they say
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way?

If they say
Why (why?), why (why?)
Hoo tell 'em
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do me that way
If they say why
Why (why?), why (why?) (She's keeping him by, keeping him around)
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Why (why?), why (why?)
Does he do my that way?
I like living this way
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
