Eagle flies across the flag
Bureaucracy is such a drag
Behold a pale horse tonight
The men in black are out of sight

She comes
He comes
We come
She comes

Across the oceans in my mind
Across the skies I left behind
A land of opportunity
A land to fill my destiny

Emigrate!
Emigrate!
Emigrate!
Emigrate!

I've been alone a long, long time
So what, I take what should be mine
I've searched the sea of empty eyes
And severed all my family ties
A mercenary feeds my soul
A plastic world, no getting old
A monkey wears the age-old crown
The other monkeys getting down

She comes
He comes
We come
She comes
Welcome

Emigrate!
Emigrate!
Emigrate!
Emigrate!

Walk through fear!
Leave you, dear!
Never wanted to create a tear!
Walk through fear!
If you dare

Emigrate!
Emigrate!
Emigrate!
Emigrate!
Emigrate!
