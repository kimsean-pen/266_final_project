Don't be shy
Don't be shy
For if you are shy for tomorrow
You'll be shy for one thousand days
Hey
Don't be shy
Don't be shy
Don't let the tide of your soul
Drown your nights and flood your days

But still its better to be shy than screaming drunken old queen
who's always got to have his way

But don't be coy with me
I am to clever to follow you down
To the dark and stormy weather, babe
The bracket's wider now
So whats your pleasure?
Swallow your pride
But please...

Don't be shy
Don't be shy
For if you are shy for tomorrow
You'll be shy for one thousand days
Now is your time to shine
Dance and hear your song
or you may wake up one day in the last chance saloon
to find your last chance has been and gone
Don't be shy
Don't be shy
For if you are shy for tomorrow
You'll be shy for one thousand days
hey hey hey.
