This side of fate
Is blind
The choice has been made
It's time

For all that we've done
Will we ever choose to sleep?
The fault of our own
This fate we must receive
We must receive

This is side of fate
Is blind
The choice has been made
It is time

We had a dream
Now it's gone
The future revealed
We were all so very wrong
We were all so wrong

This is side of fate
Is blind
The choice has been made
It is time

What have we done?
There's nowhere to run
There's no [?]

We were so wrong
Now we're lost
We can't go wrong
Until we are right

Don't say it's over
Don't let us down
Don't turn away
We need you now

This is side of fate
It is blind
The choice has been made
It is time

For all that we've done
Will we ever choose to see
The fault of our own
This pain we must receive
