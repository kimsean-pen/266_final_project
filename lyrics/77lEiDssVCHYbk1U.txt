I'm a girl's girl, I'm a boss in a man's world
Yeah I can pick and roll pass ballerina twirl
Skating through the city with my snapback on
Still be looking pretty with no makeup on
Hit Sephora quick, get a red lip
But meet me on the court
I'll ball you up right quick
They be like baby baby how you get so fine
But I don't do know favors for the studio time

My mama said marry a rich man
And I was like, mama
I am that rich man

Oh my me, oh my God
How'd this girl get so fly
I do what you doing boy
Doing it like a tomboy

Oh my me, oh my God
How'd this girl get so fly
I do what you doing boy
Doing it like a tomboy

Solo riding, barely trying
They know to call me when they wanna get it popping
Sweet like some honey but I always go hard
I don't like the drama but I'll finish what you start
I'm making sure you get the memo, yeah
I'll meet you up on any level, yeah
Independent don't need help
Underestimate me, you'll be playing yourself

My mama said marry a rich man
And I was like, mama
I am that rich man

Oh my me, oh my God
How'd this girl get so fly
I do what you doing boy
Doing it like a tomboy

Oh my me, oh my God
How'd this girl get so fly
I do what you doing boy
Doing it like a tomboy

I'll make a jealous girl my friend
I'll make an ex want me again
I got the best of both worlds
I can hang with the dudes
Get pretty with the girls

Oh my me, oh my God
How'd this girl get so fly
I do what you doing boy
Doing it like a tomboy

Oh my me, oh my God
How'd this girl get so fly
I do what you doing boy
Doing it like a tomboy

Like a tomboy
