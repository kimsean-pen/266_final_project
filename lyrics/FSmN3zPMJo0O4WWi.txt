Let the light get into the room
So I can see your face
You don't need to hurry
You can stay here some more
As I just want to talk (to talk)
I know it sounds so strange (strange)
I feel it's hard to give a sense to everything

When I'm down
It's hard to walk away
'Cause nothing seem to change
The sun will never heal the rain

Life goes on and I bury another day
(I feel so empty now)
As grief and rage and fear rise up at once
(Alone in the maze where I'm lost)
Keep holding my hand
I promise I won't shed a tear
(Look at me)
But please never let me go
I don't know what else to do
(It's hurting so much inside)

When I'm down
It's hard to walk away
'Cause nothing seem to change
The sun will never heal the rain

When I'm down
It's hard to see your face
While all things seem to fade
The sun will never heal the rain

Here we go again
I can't take it anymore
Another drink alone
Until my life gets numb
We used to be so close
Now we are so far apart
I wish I could let go
But you are forever gone

When I'm down
It's hard to walk away
'Cause nothing seem to change
The sun will never heal the rain

When I'm down
It's hard to see your face
While all things seem to fade
The sun will never heal the rain
