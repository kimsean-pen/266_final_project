Fish belly white up all night
Hang around at the dark side town
Never thought he would wake up from a fist fight
Never thought he would get knocked down

One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven
twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen nineteen twenty
Go find you a girl to steal all your money
Go find a boy to rob your health
No onions, happiness, banter and wealth
