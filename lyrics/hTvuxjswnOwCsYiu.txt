Hey mama, it's me
Said you better wait child
Said you've been a long time running
Hey mama, answer me
Baby boy you better sit down
Can't listen when the sun's out
My only son this will be so hard to hear

C'mon mama what do you mean
I know you've been knocked down
I know it ain't all been easy
Nothing ever good really is

Why you gotta wait so long
Why you gotta wait so long

But she said son
Let me reason with you
You think you carry such a weight
I know I never beat you boy
Better start acting like
This here's a race

You ain't gone far enough to say
At least I tried
You ain't worked hard enough to say
Well I've done mine
You ain't run far enough to say
My legs have failed
You ain't gone far enough
You ain't worked hard enough
You ain't run far enough to say
It ain't gonna get any better

You picked a bad time
You picked a bad time to listen to me
You picked a bad time
You picked a bad time to listen to me
You picked a bad time
You picked a bad time to listen to me
You picked a bad time
You picked a bad time to listen to me

You ain't gone far enough to say
At least I tried
You ain't worked hard enough to say
Well I've done mine
You ain't run far enough to say
My legs have failed
You ain't gone far enough
You ain't worked hard enough
You ain't run far enough to say
It ain't gonna get any better
