If none of us believe in war
Then can you tell me, what the weapons for?
Listen to me everyone
If the button is pushed, there'll be nowhere to run
Giants sleeping, giants winning

Wars within their dreams
Till they wake when it's too late
And in God's name blaspheme
Killer of giants, threatens us all

Mountains of madness standing so tall
Marches of protest
not stopping the war
or the killer of giants
the killer of giants

Mother nature people state your
case without it's worth

Your seas run dry your
sleepless eyes
are turning red alert
Killer of giants, threatens us all
Mountains of madness

standing so tall
Rising so proudly
it has nowhere to fall
This killer of giants
This killer of giants
Yeah!
Killer of giants, threatens us all
Mountains of madness
standing so tall
Marches of protest
not stopping the war
oh the killer of giants
oh the killer of giants
killer of giants
killer of giants
