Coz it was the first time,
the kids ever wrote their own names It was the first time,
I'm sure When was the last time,
the kids ever checked their own weight?
All in a picture, I'm sure It's the blue light, It's the blue light (
If you call me by my name) Keeping you awake, awake (
If you take me with the shame) It's
the blue light, It's the blue light (
If you call me by my name?) Keeping you awake,
awake So when was the last time, that you knew the kids were alright?
When was the last time, you knew?
You never know.
All of our bodies,
they used to be perfect back then All of our
bodies, I'm sure It's the blue light, It's the blue light (
If you call me by my name) Keeping you awake, awake (
If you take me with the shame) It's
the blue light, It's the blue light (
If you call me by my name?) Keeping you awake,
awake It's the blue light, It's the blue light Keeping you awake,
awake For sure It's the blue light,
It's the blue light Keeping you awake,
awake For sure It's the blue light, It's the blue light (
If you call me by my name) Keeping you awake, awake (
You could take me with the shame)
It's the blue light, It's the blue light (
If you call me by my real name?) Keeping you awake, awake
