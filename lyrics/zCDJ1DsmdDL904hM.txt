Yeah ahh!
Yeah ahh!
Yeah ahh!

I find it hard to live with all my choices
It's time to turn a deaf ear to those voices
Did you ever think to ask my opinion? (yeah)
Did you ever think to ask if I'm okay?

I've burned down every bridge that I've found
Now I limit myself to a 6 gun quota
I played down every feeling I felt and
I bottled them up until the well ran over

Yeah

Give every indication that you're mended
Take every rule you come across and bend it
Did you ever think to ask my opinion? (yeah)
Did you ever think to ask Im okay?

I've burned down every bridge that I've found
Now I limit myself to a 6 gun quota
I played down every feeling I felt and
I bottled them up until the well ran over

I've burned down every bridge that I've found
Now I limit myself to a 6 gun quota
I played down every feeling I felt and
I bottled them up until the well ran over

It feels so good to be numb whoa-oh
I hate what I have become whoa-oh
It feels so good to be numb whoa-oh

I've burned down every bridge that I've found
Now I limit myself to a 6 gun quota
I played down every feeling I felt and
I bottled them up until the well ran over

I've burned down every bridge that I've found

I played down every feeling I felt and
I bottled them up until the well ran over
