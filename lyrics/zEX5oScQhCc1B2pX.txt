Burning through the sky
There's no gravity
Hunger in my eyes
Ain't no stopping me
Can't bring me down
I guess it goes around

Heart over my head
Back against the wall
I'm 100% and not afraid to fall
I risk it all
When it comes to call

Tell me now did I get your attention?
Did you get the answer to your question?

Everybody cries
But not today, but not today
'Cause I won't let you
Everybody dies
But not today, not me
'Cause I've never been better

I'm still on my feet
The world can't knock me down
'Cause I won't take defeat
I'm still chasing the crowd
But I'm still around
Look who's winning now

Hey, tell me now did I get your attention?
Did you hear the answer to your question?

Everybody cries
But not today, but not today
'Cause I won't let you
Everybody dies
But not today, not me
'Cause I've never been better

All together
Never been better
All together
I've never been better

I'm never giving up
No such thing as enough
I keep on winning
Just beginning to get all that I want
Nothing can hold me back
'Cause I'm not made for that
I'm always good but I've been better lately

Everybody cries
But not today, but not today
'Cause I won't let you
Everybody dies
But not today, not me
'Cause I've never been better

All together
Never been better, c'mon
All together, woah!
I've never been better

Everybody cries
But not today, but not today
'Cause I won't let you
Everybody dies
But not today, oh not me
'Cause I've never been better

C'mon, all together
Oh, I've never been better
C'mon, all together
I've never been better
