Some parts of my brain are probably still sleeping
I wish I could tell but I'm probably still sleeping
I look to the window
I look through your eyes
I can see my reflection but I cant close the blinds
Its like, someones determined to change how I think but if I just close my eyes I'll wake from each dream
Would it let you down if we dont grow up?
Would it make you proud if we gave up?
What about anybody, they're all just chasing money
Would it let you down if we dont grow up?
Would it make you proud if we gave up?
What about anybody, they're all just chasing honey
If ever you want me
if ever you need me
I may not be concious but baby, I'm honest
I look to the mirror
I look through your heart
I can see good intentions but we tear them apart
Its like, someones determined to change how I think but if I just close my eyes I'll wake from each dream
Would it let you down if we dont grow up?
Would it make you proud if we gave up?
What about anybody, they're all just chasing money
Would it let you down if we dont grow up?
Would it make you proud if we gave up?
What about anybody, they're all just chasing honey
What's oxygen on the weekend?
Just caught a cold outside
But when I called you Monday
I needed you Sunday
I needed you honey
Would it let you down if we dont grow up?
Would it make you proud if we gave up?
What about anybody, they're all just chasing money
Would it let you down if we dont grow up?
Would it make you proud if we gave up?
What about anybody, they're all just chasing honey
But when I called you Monday
I needed you Sunday
I needed you honey
