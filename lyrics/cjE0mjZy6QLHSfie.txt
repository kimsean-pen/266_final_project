HEY! you're part of it
YEA! you're part of it
HEY! you're part of it
YEA! you're part of it

I walk the streets of a Carolina
watching people pushing shopping carts
and there's a guy above me
and he's washing windows
making ten bucks a pop
and he says to me...

HEY! you're part of it
YEA! you're part of it
HEY! you're part of it
YEA! you're part of it

and I said Sir, well have you heard
that this country is unequal still?
History continues itself
continues itself
history continues itself
and I did not create the rules.
From all I've heard
and all I've seen
this place has broken
my american heart
from all I've heard
and all I've seen
this place has broken
my american heart

HEY! you're part of it
YEA! you're part of it
HEY! you're part of it
YEA! you're part of it
