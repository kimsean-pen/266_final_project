There are worse things I could do
Than go with a boy or two
Even though the neighborhood thinks I'm trashy and no good
I suppose it could be true
But there are worse things I could do

I could flirt with all the guys
Smile at them and bat my eyes
Press against them when we dance
Make them think they stand a chance
Then refuse to see it through
That's a thing I'd never do

I could stay home every night
Wait around for Mr.Right
Take cold showers everyday
And throw my life away
On a dream that won't come true

I could hurt someone like me
Out of spite or jealousy
I don't steal
And I don't lie, but I can feel
And I can cry
A fact I'll bet you never knew
But to cry in front of you
That's the worst thing I could do
