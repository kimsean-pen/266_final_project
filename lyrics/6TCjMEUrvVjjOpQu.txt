Uh-huh, tell me you're dreamin'
Just wait a long time for a place like this
Uh-huh, just what I needed
Workin' all night for a space like this
Uh-huh, cut to the beginning
Nothing so beautiful as nothingness
Uh-huh, baby, we're livin' in it
Livin' in a world, white walls so illuminated
Uh-huh, everywhere we been
My man sure have got the place that we left
And you, you can do anything
You can lay it on me through the bass like that
Uh-huh, if another lover
Gimme, gimme, put you all, all onto me
'Cause, baby, we're livin'
Livin' in a world, white walls so illuminated

Black, blue, tell me what to do
I will not fight and rip the stories and the truth
Disco detonator, pull up and I knew it
Turn around, take the final look before I do it
Hey, you, distorted and diluted
Start to come around but you was gone before I knew it
Fiction generates but light shines in
Like you're under my thumb, like you're under my skin

Knuckles in, knuckles in, knuckles in
Knuckles in, knuckles in, knuckles in
Guys, guys, guys, girl
All in on the bathrooms, all in on the bathrooms
Knuckles in, knuckles in, knuckles in
Knuckles in, knuckles in, knuckles in
Guys, guys, guys, girl
All in on the bathrooms, all in on the bathrooms

Black, blue, tell me what to do
I will not fight, I wear the stories and the truth
Disco detonator, pull up and I knew it
Turn around, take the final look before I do it
Hey, you, distorted and diluted
Start to come around but you was gone before I knew it
Fiction generates but light shines in
Like you're under my thumb, like you're under my skin
