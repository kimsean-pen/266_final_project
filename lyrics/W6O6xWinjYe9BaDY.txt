What have they been telling you
About the way things are?
Could you have foreseen back then
That you would come this far?
It was touch and go there for a while
Don't you agree?

Did you play with Barbie dolls
When no one else was around?
Pardon me if I sound ignorant
But the change is so profound
What was going through your head
As they struck you down to the ground?

What they think is patriotic
Barely passes for robotic
And not one of them could last
Three minutes in your shoes
The darkness almost swallowed you up
That must have been quite a case
Of the blues

I know that I'm supposed to be
Incensed by what they say you've done
But I only feel compassion 'cause
They're liars, every one
You've been keeping secrets all your life
But now you are done

Chelsea is a butterfly, she metamorphisized
You can't catch her with your net
'Cause she is free inside
You can't stop the progress of the truth
Try as you might

You can't stop the progress of the truth
Try as you might
