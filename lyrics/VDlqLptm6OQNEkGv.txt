Like a string my life connects and breaks off
And the design is described by getting twisted up
So many memories with you are drawn in it
And they become a verse that colors my life

I follow the footprints you left
To carve your existence in my heart
Though I can't be with you until the end
I walk with the hope you left in my hand

These words would not reach you
The time I thought would never change
Was surely passing by

If I ever get used to the fact you're not here
That's because my heart is saturated with you
In decaying memories
Hoping that vividness is left forever

I won't look back and might make you feel alone
I want to see the unseen sight until I stop waking sometime
