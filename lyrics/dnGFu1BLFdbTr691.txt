I mask up my emotions
I try to hide the pain inside
I feel so cold I wanna cry
But I can't let it go
'Cause that's not the man you know

My self-esteem is broken
You came to my life and made it right
I'm so grateful I wanna cry
But I won't let it show
'Cause that's not the man you know

Most of the time I hide my pain inside
I got a lot going on inside my mind
I got some people trying to block me when I shine
I wanna fight but its just a waste of time
Yeah, it's just a waste of time
