Nightmares, oh, nightmares, come on now
Getting my days all wrong now
Risen from prison an outlaw
Spending our time in the lion's jaw

In the end
You sink or swim
I'm eager
I'm eager

Loving, more loving, come on now
Socially biting your tongue now
Run down, old run down old houses
Feeding the cats to the mouses

Oh, take aim now, oh, take aim now
Can you see me in the way now?
Oh, take aim now, oh, take aim now
Gotta get us out of here

Drop them and give them star prizes
Lock them away in high rises
Held off and called on by truncheons
Rattling keys to the dungeons

Oh, take aim now, oh, take aim now
Can you see me in the way now?
Oh, take aim now, oh, take aim now
Gotta get us out of here

Love, take me over
I bid you all farewell, I got to leave
Tears on my shoulder
Switch me off today

Oh, take aim now, oh, take aim now
Can you see me in the way now?
Oh, take aim now, oh, take aim now
Gotta get us out of here

Oh, take aim now, oh, take aim now
Can you see me in the way now?
Oh, take aim now, oh, take aim now
Gotta get us out of here

Love, take me over
I bid you all farewell, I've got to leave
