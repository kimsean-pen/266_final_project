Born to save and born for weakness
Boil your blood to beat the sickness
It's the day of resurrection
Time has come
Faking like you're awake in
Whatever state of sedation
I bring a mutation
But you don't want me to close your eyes
Before it's real
I am the perfect nightmare
Watch and believe
I'm the perfect nightmare
Rising out of nowhere
God you made me perfect
Save yourself, just beg for more
Pray for your god
Set you free
Pray for your god
In the grave
Pray for your God
For forever
Pray for me
How do you love yourself in a goddamn nightmare
Trust yourself when you're going insane
Burned the bridges you ain't getting back there
So I'll save your soul
Darkness open wide for me
Nothing else fills the hole
Overflow, running down the walls
I'm the perfect nightmare
Rising out of nowhere
God you made me perfect
Save yourself, just beg for more
Pray for your god
Set you free
Pray for your god
In the grave
Pray for your god
For forever
Pray for me
Born to save and born for weakness
Boil your blood
Born to save and born for weakness
Boil your blood to beat the sickness
I am the perfect nightmare
I am the perfect nightmare
I am the perfect one
Now I am stronger than your god
I am the perfect one
The perfect one
I am the perfect one
