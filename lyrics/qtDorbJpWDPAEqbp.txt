I can't help it, if I could I would change it
'Cause lately I've been feeling so vacant
I can't help it, if I could I would change it
'Cause lately I've been feeling so vacant
I can't help it, if I could I would change it

Nowadays I been wasting all my days
Holding out waiting for something to change
Everybody always ask if I'm okay
And I'm mad 'cause I don't know what to say
It's like I'm feeling like I'm going insane
I got enemies that live up in my brain
Yeah, you ask why I'm feeling this way

I can't help it, if I could I would change it
'Cause lately I've been feeling so vacant
I can't help it, if I could I would change it
'Cause lately I've been feeling so vacant
I can't help it, if I could I would change it

On my phone and I feel like I'm in air
All alone and in the hotel
You always told me you would be the one to help
Then you left, now it's me and myself
Funny how it changed up like that
I feel like having a panic attack
Can't understand, I can never really explain it

I can't help it, if I could I would change it
'Cause lately I've been feeling so vacant
I can't help it, if I could I would change it
'Cause lately I've been feeling so vacant
I can't help it, if I could I would change it
