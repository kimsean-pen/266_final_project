I never though hyenas essential
They're crude
And unspeakably plain
But maybe
They've a glimmer of potential
If allied
To my vision and brain
I know that your powers of retention
Are as whet as a warthog's backside
But thick as you are
Pay attention
My words are a matter of pride
It's clear from your vacant expressions
The lights are not all on upstairs
But we're talking kings and sucsessions
Even you can't be caught unawares
So prepare for the chance of a lifetime
Be prepared for sensational news
A shining new era
Is tiptoeing nearer
(and where do we feature)
Just listen to teacher
I know it sounds sordid
But you'll be rewarded
When at last I am given my dues
And in justice deliciously squared
Be prepared
(Yeah! Be prepared! We'll be prepared! For what?)
For the death of the king!
(why? Is he sick?)
No fool, we're gonna kill him
Simba too
(Great idea! Who needs a king!)
(No king no king la la la la la la)
Idiots!
There will be a king!
(Eh, but you said uh...)
I will be king
Stick with me
And you'll never go hungry again
(Yay! Alright long live the king!)
It's great that we'll soon be connected
With a king who'll be all time adored
Of course prid pro quo
You're expected
To take certain duties aboard
The future is littered with prizes
And though I'm the main addressee
The point that I must emphasize is
You won't get a sniff without me!
So prepare for the coup of the century
Be prepared for the murkiest scam
Meticulous planning
Tenacity spanning
Decades of denial
Is simply why I'll
Be king undisputed
Respected
Saluted
And seen for the wonder I am
Yes my teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared!
Yes our teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared!
