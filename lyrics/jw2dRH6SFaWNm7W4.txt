Outside the rain begins and it may never end
so cry no more on the shore a dream
will take us out to sea
forever more forever more
close your eyes and dream
and you can be with me
'neath the waves through the caves of hours
long forgotten now
we're all alone we're all alone
Close the window calm the light
and it will be alright
no need to bother now
let it out let it all begin
learn how to pretend
Once a story's told
it can't help but grow old
roses do lovers too
so cast your seasons to the wind
and hold me dear oh hold me dear
Close the window calm the light
and it will be alright
no need to bother now
let it out let it all begin
all's forgotten now
we're all alone oh oh we're all alone
close the window calm the light
and it will be alright
no need to bother now
let it out let it all begin
owe it to the wind my love
