We call out to the
Beasts of the sea to
Come forth, and join us
This night is yours
Because one day
We will all be with you
In the blackened deep
One day, we will all
Go into the water

Go into the water,
live there, die there
Live there, die
We reject our
Earthly fires

Gone are days of land-empires
Lungs transform to take in water
Cloaked in scales, we swim
And swim home

We are alive
And we'll metamorphisize
And we'll sink
As we devolve back to beasts
Our home is down here
And we've known this for years
We must conquer from the sea

We are an army
With water steeds
We'll rise
From our depths down below
Release yourselves
Drown with me
We will conquer
Land with water

Gone are days of land-empires
Lungs transform to take in water
Cloaked in scales, we swim
And swim home
We swim home...
We swim home...
