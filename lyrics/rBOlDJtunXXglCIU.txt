in the eyes of lovers every sight's divine
not waiting for the others yet never quite on time
hoping for disasters but praying through night
we'll blow ourselves to pieces, shattered by the light
walking down hiroshima street
walking down hiroshima street

embassadors and diplomats wouldn't help us if they could
they'd watch us from afar and then turn their eyes for good
say nightynight to everyone in this part of town
or see me meet my destiny when I'm walking down...
walking down hiroshima street
walking down hiroshima street

don't expect some miracle to save you this time, girl
the ashes of your memories or the history of the world
a hundred years of labour will fall into the dark
the destruction of my universe only needs one single spark
walking down hiroshima street
walking down hiroshima street

in another time in another life
we'll go back and we'll make it right
now there's not much more I can say
but that I'll carry you with me the whole way
I'm walking my hiroshima street
I'm walking my hiroshima street
