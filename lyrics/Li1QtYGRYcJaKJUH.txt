Connection!
Connection!

I'm always looking back in time
Memories of all the things
That I have left behind
And sometimes all this is too much
I'd gladly trade in virtual
For someone I can touch!

Let's escape
Deactivate
Forget about perfection tonight!

Come with me
And let's go see
If we can make connection tonight!

It's always burning in my mind
Memories are getting lost
Beneath the sands of time
And sometimes I'm trapped inside the game
I'd gladly disconnect from it with someone who feels the same!

Let's escape
Deactivate
Forget about perfection tonight!

Come with me
And let's go see
If we can make connection tonight!

Let's close our eyes
And make distractions all subside
And let's defect and disconnect
From everything outside!

Let's escape
Deactivate
Forget about perfection tonight!

Come with me
And let's go see
If we can make connection tonight!

Connection!
Connection!
Connection!
