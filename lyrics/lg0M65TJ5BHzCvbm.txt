Kneel down you sinners, to streetwise religion
Greed's been crowned the new king
Hollywood dream teens, yesterday's trash queens
Save the blessing for the final ring, Amen

Take a ride
On the wild side
Wild side

I carry my crucifix under my death list
Forward my mail to me in hell
Liars and the martyrs, lost faith in the Father
Long lost is the wishing well

Do you ride
On the wild side?
Wild side

Fallen angels, so fast to kill
Thy kingdom come on the wild side
Our Father, who ain't in Heaven
Be Thy name on the wild side

Holy Mary, Mother may I
Pray for us on the wild side
Wild side, wild side

Name dropping no names, glamorize cocaine
Puppets with strings of gold
East L.A. at midnight, papa won't be home tonight
Found dead with his best friend's wife

Take a ride
On the wild side
Wild side

Take a ride
On the wild side
Wild side

Can't fight, fatal strikes
We lie on the wild side
No escape, murder rape
Doin' time on the wild side

A baby cries, a cop dies
A day's pay on the wild side
Wild side, wild side
Tragic life on the wild side

Wild side, wild side
Kickin' ass on the wild side
No way back on the wild side
