Well, I wish there was someone,
Well, I wish there was someone to love me.
When I used to be someone,
And I knew there was someone that loved me.
As I sit here frozen alone,
Even ghosts get tired and go home,

As they crawl back under the stones.

And I wish there was something,

Please tell me there's something better.
And I wish there was something,
More than this saturated loneliness.
And I wish I could feel it,
And I wish I could steal it.

Abduct it, corrupt it but I never can,
It's just saturated loneliness.

Does the silence get lonely?
Does the silence get lonely, who knows?

I've been hearing it tell me.
I've been hearing it tell me, "go home".
'Cause the freaks are playing tonight,
They packed up and turned out the lights.

And I wish there was something,

Please tell me there's something better.
And I wish there was something,

More than this saturated loneliness.
And I wish I could feel it,
And I wish I could steal it.
Abduct it, corrupt it but I never can,
It's just saturated loneliness.

And the bathwater's cold,
And this life's getting old.
And I wish I could feel it!
And I wish I could feel it!

And I wish I could steal it!
Abduct it, corrupt it!

And I wish I could feel it!
And I wish I could steal it!
And I wish I could feel it!
Abduct it, corrupt it!
But I never can!
I never can!
Never can.
Never can.
Never can.
