Tryna find my nigga and his other bitch, sliding
Me and all my bitches on the highway, riding
Bitchin' bout my nigga and his other bitch, sliding

We gone act a donkey on this monkey and her mom and them
Ima act a fool, that's what you take me for

They tie they shoes and take they earrings out
If I catch my name up in her mouth she get a second round
Hands on, put your pants on, I got moves to make
Fuck up out my face, up out my living space, you just a waste
I can't waste my waist, my thighs, my time, and all my energy
Tryna keep a nigga who not just for me
Lose her if you lose her cause its cheaper just to keep her
I'll admit that I'm a movie but I don't come with a sequel, nah
Running to my people then I really wish you well
They gon run up in your spot and I'ma see that that's in hell, yeah
Why you gotta lie about a bitch
Ain't no secrets boy it's been a while
I am not a child and boy them fairy tales just ain't my style
Happily ever after turns to better after all
I be wishing I ain't need you when I don't if I can't have it all
I got me and all my bitches on the highway, riding
Tryna find my nigga and his other bitch, sliding
Me and all my bitches on the highway, riding
Bitchin' bout my nigga and his other bitch, sliding

I got me and all my bitches on the highway, riding
Tryna find my nigga and his other bitch, sliding
Me and all my bitches on the highway, riding
Bitchin' bout my nigga and his other bitch, sliding
