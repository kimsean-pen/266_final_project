In this life like weeds, you're just a rock to me
You're just a rock to me, you're just a rock to me
And in this life like weeds, you're just a rock to me
And in this life like weeds, in this life like weeds

I could have told you all that I love you
And in the places you go, you'll see the place where you're from
I could have told you all that I love you
And in the faces you meet, you'll see the place where you'll die

I could have told you all that I love you
And on the day that you die, you'll see the people you've met
I could have told you all that I love you
And in the faces you see, you'll see just who you've been

I wish I could have told you all

In this life like weeds, in this life like weeds
Eyes need us to see, hearts need us to bleed
In this life like weeds, you're a rock to me
I know where you're from, but where do you belong?

In this life like weeds, you're the dirt I'll breathe
In this life like weeds, you're a rock to me

In this life like weeds, in this life like weeds
I know where you're from, but where do you belong?
In this life like weeds, eyes need us to see
Hearts need us to bleed in this life like weeds
In this life like weeds, you're the dirt I'll breathe

All this talking all the time and the air fills up, up
Up until there's nothing left to breathe
And you think you feel most everything
And we know that our hearts are just made out of strings to be pulled
Strings to be pulled

So you think you've figured out everything
But we know that our minds are just made out of strings to be pulled
Strings to be pulled

All this talking all the time and the air fills up, up
Up until there's nothing left to breathe
Up until there's nothing left to speak
Up into the better parts of space
