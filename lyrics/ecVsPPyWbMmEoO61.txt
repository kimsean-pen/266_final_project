How long have I given all I've got?
Here I stand
My days and nights now are solitude
I struggle on
I've paid my price

All I had I gave

So much still lingers inside my head
I've lost it all
No trace of tolerance I can find
An empty heart
I've paid my price

All I had I gave
Save all that you feel for me
