One cold damp evening
The world stood still
I watched as I held my breath
A silhouette I thought I knew
Came through, someone spoke to me
Whispered in my ear
This fantasy's for you
Fantasy's are in this year
My whole life flashed, before my eyes
I thought, what they say is true
I've shed my skin, and my disguise
And cold on the naked eye
Emerged from my cocoon
And a half remembered tune played softly in my head
He said
He turns smiling... and said

I realise a miracle, is due
I dedicate this melody, to you
I realise a miracle, is due
I dedicate this melody, to you
But is this the stuff dreams are made of?
If this is the stuff dreams are made of
No wonder I feel like I'm floating on air
No wonder I feel like I'm floating on air
I realise a miracle, is due
I dedicate this melody, to you
But is this the stuff dreams are made of?
If this is the stuff dreams are made of
No wonder I feel like I'm floating on air
No wonder I feel like I'm floating on air
No wonder I feel like I'm floating on air
Everywhere
Oh, it feels like I'm everywhere
Like when you fail to make the connection, you know vital it is
Oh when something slips through your fingers you know precious it is
And you reach the point when you know
It's only your second skin
It's only your second skin
Someone's banging on my door
