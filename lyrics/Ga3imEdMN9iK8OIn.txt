Facts based on Einstein and his followers
This had to work, he was an educated man
All the equations were perfectly arranged
So he could have a front-row seat now

And your conscience is low
And your conscience is

Burning a path for us to share
Clothes draped on silos near the Emperor's gate now

And your conscience is low
Conscience is low

But he couldn't find another way
He searched for years but yet he couldn't find the answer
A bleeding afterbirth of what was done
Still lurked in shadows and appeared in every corner

Give me a call, give me a call
Give me a call so I can teach you a lesson
Give me a call, give me a call
Give me a call so I can give you a reason to stay

And your conscience is low
Conscience is low

Ninety nine
Two hundred and five
Pyrite

Trickles down the spines of those without their enemies
Real or not, the spine still tingles it
So predictable but I hope you're that aware
That people will notice this forgery

And your conscience is low
Conscience is low

But he couldn't find another way
(Give me a call)
He searched for years but yet he couldn't find the answer
Give me a call, give me a call
Give me a call so I can give you a reason to stay

And your conscience is low
Conscience is low
