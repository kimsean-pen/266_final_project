feeling the weight of unseen chains
this routine is growing thin
it's a narrow path that we walk
and the walls are closing in
caving in
is there room still for us to grow
within the bounds we've come to know

beneath the dust of our days
hides the key to our emotions
and it's been a while since we've been moved
without going through the motions
no emotions
is there time still for us to show
feelings we forgot long ago

living life in still water
blinded by what we've become
YOU get tired of screaming
when you're not reaching anyone

I think its time now for YOU to know
holding on is easier than letting go

living life in still water
blinded by what we've become
YOU get tired of screaming
when you're not reaching anyone

living life in still water
blinded by what we've become
YOU get tired of screaming
when you're not reaching anyone
