I'm feeling helpless on days just like this
I'm at the end of my rope
But I can't let you in
But then it hits me and everything changed
I can't let the darkness take over me
We all have pain, we can't erase
It's how we deal with it
Well it doesn't mean
We can't move on
And start to live again
What goes around, comes around
(Woah)
And what goes up, must come down
I know that every begining, has to come to an end
Let's make the most of the time we spent
(Woah)
What goes around, comes around
Let's make it count
I know I can't change the past
But I can write my future
I've seen the worst out of the ones i've looked up to
We all have pain, we can't erase
It's how we deal with it
Well it doesn't mean
We can't move on
And start to live again
What goes around, comes around
(Woah)
And what goes up, must come down
I know that every begining, has to come to an end
Let's make the most of the time we spent
(Woah)
What goes around, comes around
Let's make it count
Let's make it count
You can't just stay in your bed
And wait for things to change
You got to get it together
Before it's too late
Before it's too late
(Oh Woah)
What goes around, comes around
(Woah)
And what goes up, must come down
I know that every begining, has to come to an end
Let's make the most of the time we spent
(Woah)
What goes around, comes around
Let's make it count
Let's make it count
