many men too tall to die
too much to be done
we caught ourselves climbing
rusting one by one
rusting one by one
rusting one by one

seed of hysteria
bitter pill
they gag us still

seed of hysteria

long way looking up
calling beasts of prey
we caught ourselves knowing
how to disobey
how to disobey
how to disobey

seed of hysteria
bitter pill
they gag us still

seed of hysteria
seed of hysteria
seed of hysteria

bitter pill
they gag us still
seed of hysteria
