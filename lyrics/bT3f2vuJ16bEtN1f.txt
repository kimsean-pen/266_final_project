I tried to fit you in the walls inside my mind
I try to keep you safely inbetween the lines
I try to put you in the box that I've designed
I try to pull you down so we are eye to eye

When did I forget that you've always been the king of the world?
I try to take life back right out of the hands of the king of the world
how could I make you so small
when you're the one who holds it all
when did i forget that you've always been the king of the world
just a whisper of your voice can tame the seas
so who am i to try to take the lead
still i run ahead and think i'm strong enough

when you're the one who made me from the dust
When did i forget that you've always been the king of the world?
I try to take life back right out of the hands of the king of the world
how could i make you so small

when you're the one who holds it all
when did i forget that you've always been the king of the world
ohhhh, you set it all in motion
every single moment
you brought it all to me
and you're holding on to me
when did i forget that you've always been the king of the world?
i try to take life back right out of the hands of the king of the world

how could i make you so small
when you're the one who holds it all
when did i forget you've always been the king of the world
you will always be the king of the world
