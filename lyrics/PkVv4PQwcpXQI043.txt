Man, I'm stressed out, I need a cigarette
She took a fall and nearly broke her neck
I'm burnt out, shit, I need some rest
But how can I escape you if you're in my head?

I'm hearing noises, what the fuck's that sound?
Abusing my liver will keep emotions down
And things just get weirder when I leave out of town

I'm not comfortable
No, I just can't seem to feel at all
I'm not comfortable
So, I'll take another pharmaceutical
'Cause I'm uncomfortable
I'm uncomfortable
Girl, I'm uncomfortable
I won't run from you
I'm uncomfortable
Yeah, I'm uncomfortable
No, no, no

I'm coming down heavy from the Adderall
Borderline drowning in these messy thoughts
I'll come down once I get some more
This substance got a hold on me, I'm insecure

I'm hearing voices, what the fuck's that sound?
I'm going through problems I shouldn't talk about
I'm thinking it's over but, shit, I'll ride it out

I'm not comfortable
No, I just can't seem to feel at all
I'm not comfortable
So, I'll take another pharmaceutical
'Cause I'm uncomfortable
I'm uncomfortable
Girl, I'm uncomfortable
I won't run from you
I'm uncomfortable
Yeah, I'm uncomfortable
No, no, no

My head could be a vessel for your own mind
All you gotta do is talk
A flood is slowly building at your wrists now
And death is just a thought

I'm not comfortable
No, I just can't seem to feel at all
I'm not comfortable
So, I'll take another pharmaceutical
'Cause I'm uncomfortable
I'm uncomfortable
Girl, I'm uncomfortable
I won't run from you
I'm uncomfortable
Yeah, I'm uncomfortable
No, no, no
