You won the battle, who won the war
Looking down the barrel of a gun that I adore
I cannot feed a fire if I haven't got a lung full

Wake up on Sunday without a thought
Standing like a pillar in a holiday resort
I swept my ankles cleanly on the cotton sheets that you bought

Hold my face up to the rain
I'll never love you like that again
But I don't mind pretending if I get to hear your voice again

Put on my shorts and tried to play the field
Romance is a crop that modern culture cannot yield
So I hang up my dancing shoes and then I put up my shield

I've seen you drinking
I've seen you drunk
Leaning like a corpse against the backdrop of the sun
And I still think you're pretty baby
I still think you're the one

Hold my face up to the rain
I'll never love you like that again
But I don't mind pretending if I get to hear your voice again

Spoke to my doctor
He said I've passed my peak
All my eggs are dying
In my twenties I'm antique
And I never learned to drive
And I never harnessed my mystique

I spend my days in the solace of my room
Pulling pubic hairs from the crotch of my swimming costume
And I don't like the president
And I don't like your perfume

Hold my face up to the rain
I'll never love you like that again
But baby you can call me if you're ever horny
I know you like to hear your name
But I don't mind pretending if I get to hear your voice again
