We break down
I'm gonna break it up again
Me and my guitar,
drowning down, down, down
Ready when the pain kicks in
Tell me when the pain kicks in
Oh I can't get away
Oh I can't get away
Oh I can't get away
No I can't get away
Had a rally with you
That's one thing I wont do
No shadow fuse
from the corner of my home
Ready when the pain kicks in
Tell me when the pain kicks in
Oh I can't get away
Oh I can't get away
Oh I can't get away
Well I can't get away
Someone says get out more, i need you
I want you
I get get this feeling off my mind
I want you
I need you
I can't get away
I can't get away
I can't get away
No I can't get away
Someone says get out more, i need you
I want you
I get get this feeling off my mind
I want you
I need you
Someone says get out more, i need you
I want you
I get get this feeling off my mind
I want you
I need you
