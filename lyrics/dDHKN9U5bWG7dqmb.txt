Many say that I'm too young
To let you know just where I'm coming from
But you will see, it's just a matter of time
My love will surely make you mine

Well, I'm livin' in a world of ghetto life
Everyone seem so uptight
But nothin's wrong, it's alright, my man
I like the way we carry on
His love will send me on and on with my man
People out there can understand

I'm givin' him somethin' he can feel
To let him know this love is real
Givin' him somethin' he can feel
To let him know this love is real
This love is real

So much joy for us it seems
So much hope for material things
Are they only in my dreams?
And that's exactly why I'm singing this song to you
To let you know that real dreams do come true
You tell me what does it mean

Livin' in a world of ghetto life
Everyone is so uptight
Nothin's wrong, it's alright, my man
I like the way we carry on
His lovin' will send me on and on with my man
People out there can you understand

Givin' him somethin' he can feel
To let him know this love is real
Givin' him somethin' he can feel
To let him know this love is real
This love is real

Givin' him somethin' he can feel
Givin' him somethin' he can feel
Givin' him somethin' he can feel
