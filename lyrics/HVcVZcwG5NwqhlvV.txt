Some day you're doing your thing
Some day you blame it on the company and a couple of drinks
Like the last of your rock 'n' roll heroes are gone
Like the last of your rock 'n' roll heroes are gone
Some day you say what you feel
Some day you say it just to feel another hand on the wheel
Like the last of your rock 'n' roll heroes are gone
Like the last of your rock 'n' roll heroes are gone
Like they're gone

Some day you walk in your shoes
Some day you're tired of the kind of nothing you got to lose
Like the last of your rock 'n' roll heroes are gone
Like the last of your rock 'n' roll heroes are gone
Some day you're making a fist
Some day you give away everything till you know what to miss
Like the last of your rock 'n' roll heroes are gone
Like the last of your rock 'n' roll heroes are gone
Like they're gone

Some day you're heading back home
Some day you wade into their water 'cause you're sinking for stone
Like the last of your rock 'n' roll heroes are gone
Like the last of your rock 'n' roll heroes are gone
Some day you turn to your friends
Some day they know why you stood up, turned into the wind
Like the last of your rock 'n' roll heroes are gone
Like the last of your rock 'n' roll heroes are gone
