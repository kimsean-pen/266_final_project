I know I'm finally rich
But ain't a damn thang gonna change
Me and my boys still bang (Bang Bang)
We'll clap a nigga up no range (I'm finally rich)
I could ride foreign cars (Skirrt)
And I love all my fans (My fans)
Without y'all I wouldn't get far (I'm finally rich)
I could smoke all the dope

I get so high, just see the scope
Real nigga from the O (I'm finally rich!)

Me and you ain't the same

All these niggas follow my campaign
And all these bitches know my name (bitch I'm finally rich)
I'mma show you how to ball
Once you walk up in the mall
Hit every store and buy it all cause it ain't shit!
I be flexing on these lames
I'm a O-Block nigga, can't change

64th street my domian, Savages
So I gotta take care of my squad

Before every fucking body get robbed
For that night job and day job (that' why I got rich)
So I could take care of my momma
Take care of my daughter
And take care of my brothers (I'm finally rich)

So just watch Sosa stack this cheddar (Sosa Baby)
Flexing and these niggas know better
Hate on me, it don't matter (I'm finally rich)
