You could follow logic
Or contest it all
The work solution makes the common house a home

The element of progress
That you mention is gone
It de-evolved to something you were headed toward

As i lay to die the things i think
Did i waste my time, i think i did
I worked for life

All we want are just pretty little homes
Our work makes pretty little homes

Like a cast shadow
Like a fathers dream
Have a cut out son
What's a worse disease
To get that pretty little home

As i lay to die the things i think
I don't want to regret what i did- and work for life

All we want are just pretty little homes
Our work makes pretty little homes

Agenda suicide
The drones work hard before they die
And give up on pretty little homes

Our work makes pretty little homes
Our work makes pretty little homes
Agenda suicide, the drones work hard before they die
And give up on pretty little homes
