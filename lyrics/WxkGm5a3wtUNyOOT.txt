sing yr children
yr children song
sing yr love child
love is on
see thru child eyes
eyes are old
and old is magic growing
see the child lights
spinning gold
everyday girl
they blow away
leaves falling to the water
wildflowers
for you today
sing yr birthday
yr birthday blues
sing yr wild light
wildflowers bloom
they will not forget you
and down/they go
to sleep/so slow
away/they grow
they go
i wait/i wait all day
sing yr love child
love is on
sing yr child lights
sing yr child lights
lights are gold
sing yr child life
wildflower soul
