It's catchin up to me right now
Everything that I said the night I left her there
When I said I wanted out
I was angry and upset
And at the time I couldnt care less about staying there
I had to prove I didn't care
As much as she thought I did

I showed her
I let my pride take me far away from the only Woman I loved
I showed her
And now she has found someone new
And her life will go on
And I'm all alone but
I showed her

I hear that she's in love
But it took a while for her to get over the hurt
Now I know that I messed up
I was trying to give us time
But I see she took that time to find somebody else
What happened to the things she felt
For me, am I really a part of her past

I showed her
I let my pride take me far away from the only Woman I loved
I showed her
And now she has found someone new
And her life will go on
And I'm all alone but
I showed her

Whoa... whoa... whoa, whoa... whoa... whoa... whoa... whoa, whoa

I showed her
I let my pride take me far away from the only Woman I loved
I showed her
And now she has found someone new
And her life will go on
And I'm all alone but
I showed her

I showed her
And now she has found someone new
And her life will go on
And I'm all alone but I showed her
Whoa, whoa
I showed her
I showed her
