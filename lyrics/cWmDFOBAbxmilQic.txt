We are adventuring, we are adventurers
And in the heart of Nepal we ran into trouble
When thieves caught sight of our elegant rubble
They ransacked our camp without saying goodnight

Okay, so yeah, but it was cool
Cuz we're like, adventurers

We are adventuring, we are adventurers
We've been to every place anywhere in the world
We are adventuring, we are adventurers

We are adventuring we are adventurers
Deep in the fall it was blazing hot
Below the equators the sunlight would start
We've travelled through jungles and tigers we've fought

But it's all cool, you know
Cuz we're like, adventurers

We are adventuring, we are adventurers
We've been to every place anywhere in the world
We are adventuring, we are adventurers

Castles and causeways and monasteries and hideaways
Castles and causeways and monasteries and hideaways
Castles and causeways and monasteries and hideaways

We are adventuring, we are adventurers
We've been to every place anywhere in the world
We are adventuring, we are adventurers

Oh and it's such fun with all these sights we've seen
Oh and it's such fun with all these sights we've seen
Oh and it's such fun with all these sights we've seen
Oh and it's such fun with all these sights we have seen
