The passion that I once felt
Lost off shore, deep in that dark blue ocean
Torn apart, by the promises I dealt
It haunts my dreams with a cruel devotion

Every nerve in my body yearns for you
Every sense in my mind tells me not to
Between the devil and the wide blue sea
I'll dive for pearls, before a grave demotion

I'm going back down into deep waters
Starry eyed
Shivers spreading as I fall
I'm going back down into deep waters
As storms arise
Let these waves embrace my soul
Just to forget it all

Tossing and turning in the nighttime, cold
Lost in thoughts, can't stop these wheels in motion
Torn apart, by the memories I hold
Stealing my sleep with a cruel devotion

Every nerve in my body yearns for you
Every sense in my mind tells me not to
Between the devil and the wide blue sea
I'll dive for pearls, before a grave demotion

I'm going back down into deep waters
Starry eyed
Shivers spreading as I fall
I'm going back down into deep waters
As storms arise
Let these waves embrace my soul
Just to forget it all
