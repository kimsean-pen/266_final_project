Headed for a blackout
Hurting like hell
Finding my way to bottom of the bottle
Packing up my suitcase
Leaving no trace
One step closer with every swallow

A deafening silence
Like you like me
Where you want me
Saying nothing
But not this time
I'm gonna say
I'm gonna say

What sober couldn't say
Couldn't break through
Under the influence of you
Incoherent, truth serum
Just enough to make me bulletproof
I'm so over this love gone violent
I'm drunk and brave enough to say
What sober couldn't say

Criminal in my mind
I've been doing time
Believing in the lie
That you still loved me
Making up for
The slamming of the door
Always wanting more but never giving

Sick of crying
Tired of trying
Always buying
Into every kiss
But not this time
I'm gonna say

What sober couldn't say
Couldn't break through
Under the influence of you
Incoherent, truth serum
Just enough to make me bulletproof
I'm so over this love gone violent
I'm drunk and brave enough to say
What sober couldn't say

Oh...
This is my intervention
Getting your attention
Oh...
I'm gonna say
I'm gonna say
I'm gonna say

What sober couldn't say
Couldn't break through
Under the influence of you
Incoherent, truth serum
Just enough to make me bulletproof
I'm so over this love gone violent
I'm drunk and brave enough to say
What sober couldn't say
What sober couldn't say
I'm so over this love gone violent
I'm drunk and brave enough to say
I'm over this, so over this.
