Strange changes come with age
Some things disappear in a day
And some things slowly fade
And you and I are like the ink staining all the other pages

We're at the edge of the world again
A step back is a step forward
Been here before when we were innocent
I saw the signs, but I couldn't find the words
Now we're stuck in a wasteland
Everyone in the dark adores you
So much regret for things I never said
I should've left. I always meant to

Shame, there's nobody to blame
People interlace by mistake sometimes
It hurts to walk away
But we're just cheap toys perpetually breaking

We're at the edge of the world again
A step back is a step forward
Been here before when we were innocent
I saw the signs, but I couldn't find the words
Now we're stuck in a wasteland
Everyone in the dark adores you
So much regret for things I never said
I should've left. I always meant to

We're at the edge of the world again
Time will never heal the distance
Been here before when we were innocent
Building this modern prison for so long
So long

We're at the edge of the world again
A step back is a step forward
Been here before when we were innocent
I saw the signs, but I couldn't find the words
Now we're stuck in a wasteland
Everyone in the dark adores you
So much regret for things I never said
I should've left. I always meant to
