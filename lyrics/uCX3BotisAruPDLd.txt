everything drifts
in and out of time
nothing stays
nothing ever changes

and I wanted to give you all
but there was nothing left to give

I read your skin
then I tore it off
it's a bare future
lying ahead of us

but please don't say
it was a waste of time
we were not wasting time
we were not wasting time

because you only know
its value when it's gone
it's only memorable
by the scars it leaves
