Metal guru, is it you?
Metal guru, is it you?
Sitting there in your armour plated chair

Metal guru, is it true?
Metal guru, is it true?
All alone without a telephone

Metal guru could it be
You're gonna bring my baby to me
She'll be wild you know
A rock 'n' roll child

Metal guru has it been
Just like a silver-studded sabre-tooth dream
I'll be clean you know
Pollution machine

Metal guru, is it you?
Metal guru, is it you?

Metal guru could it be
You're gonna bring my baby to me
She'll be wild you know
A rock 'n' roll child

Metal guru, is it you?
Metal guru, is it you?
All alone without a telephone

Metal guru could it be
You're gonna bring my baby to me
She'll be wild you know
A rock'n'roll child

Metal guru, is it you?
Metal guru, is it you?
Metal guru, is it you?
