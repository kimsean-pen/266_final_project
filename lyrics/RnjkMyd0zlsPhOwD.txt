I could never ever let you go
Ever stronger when you let it go, go
I don't really feel that you should go, no
We can work it out, yes you know
Yeah, you know
So, listen
We need to talk about this love
We need to talk about this love
We need to talk about this love
We need to talk about this
Everything, I felt it from the core
First thing, all my instincts I ignored
All of them
Now he came along and broke the chains, chains
I don't wanna do this shit again
Again, oh, listen
We need to talk about this love
We need to talk about this love
We need to talk about this love
We need to talk about this
We need to talk about this love
We need to talk about this love
We need to talk about this love
We need to talk about this
(We need to, we need to, we need to talk we need)
We need to talk about this
We need to talk about this love
We need to talk about this
We need to talk about this love
We need to talk about this love
We need to talk about this love
We need to talk about this love
We need to talk about this
