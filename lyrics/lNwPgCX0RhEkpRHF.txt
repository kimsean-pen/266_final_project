Jonathan
He's the king of sting, Mr. Morphine my friend
Uncle Slam, medicine man
And I'm a junkie with a big King Kong sized Monkey
Crawling up and down my back

Doctor Rockter
Oh, I'll help ya son to rearrange your mind
Oh, I'll help ya son, but ya gotta buy this time
I'm your doctor

Jonathan to Doctor
Help me please, oh Doctor help me please
Doctor Rockter, you know I need you
Doctor please, my M.D., fix me in my time of need
But, can ya see the fire that's in my eyes

Jonathan
Its the mirror from the wall, that's on the table
Feeding me little white lies
And I'm wasted in a waste land, I'm a junk man
I got tombstones in my eyes

Ah, help me Uncle Slam, the beast claims another man
Cocaine, codeine, 714, a tuinol blindfold just what I need
Help me, help me, help me

Help me please, oh Doctor, help me please
Doctor Rockter, you know I need you
Doctor please, my M.D. fix me in my time of need
But, can you see the fire that's in my eyes
