I know what I know, what I know, what I know, what I know

Hey, not many things I know but I know, what I know and I'll grow
There was a time when I was low, so low, so low
It's a time when I had to show

I got a heart that's primal
Cause yeah, I need your love for my survival
Life's got me on trial
I confess I've been messed up, in denial

This is what it means to be human
I don't know much, but I know this much is true (Hey)
This is what it means to be human

I don't know much, but I know that I hurt as much as you

(Hey)
I go where I go, where I go, where I go, where I go
'Cause I'm a foreigner everywhere I roam (Hey)
But I see in you what I see in myself
Written in the marrow of my bones

Got a heart that's primal
(There's nowhere else I'd rather be)
Cause yeah, I need your love
(Pulling me up on my feet)
For my survival
('Til the bright lights come for me)
Hey, life's got me on trial
(There's nowhere else I'd rather be)
I confess I've been messed up
(Wandering down the street)
In denial
('Til the bright lights come for me)

This is what it means to be human
I don't know much, but I know this much is true (Hey)
This is what it means to be human
I don't know much, but I know that I hurt as much as you

Got a heart that's primal
(This is what it means to be human)
I don't know much, but I know this much is true
This is what it means to be human
I don't know much, but I know that I hurt as much as you
(Got a heart that's primal)
This is what it means to be human
(I confess I've been messed up, in denial)
Don't know much, but I know this much is true

Human, human
(I don't know much, but I know that I hurt as much as you)
Human, human
Human, human
Human, human
