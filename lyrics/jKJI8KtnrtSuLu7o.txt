It's a cabaret, taking over on a quiet lazy backseat day
And it's so beautiful
Like the sunshine on your balcony
Just yesterday

Don't underestimate
Your heart is never late
And love will always find a way

It just happens
You don't know what's going on
If it's new or if it's been there since long
If it's right or wrong

You fall in love
You fall in love

You don't have a say
Just let it slide and close your eyes and watch the passion play

Don't underestimate
Your heart can never wait
And love will always find a way

You fall in love
It just happens
You fall in love
Oh! It just happens ooh yeah...
You fall in love
It just happens, happens oh!
You fall in love

Don't underestimate
Your heart can never wait
Love will always find a way

It just happens
And you don't know what's going on
If it's new or if it's been there since long
If it's right or wrong...

You fall in love
Oh! it just happens
You fall in love
It just happens ooh!
You fall in love
Oh! it just happens, happens
You fall in love
Oh...
