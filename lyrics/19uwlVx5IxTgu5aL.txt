Hey, you with that perfect face
I'm not sure if it's a game I should play
Do you have something good to say?
'Cause I've got 300 elephants shitting on my grave
What's fun when there's nothing to do?
You said you could cum and I said I could too
I wish there was more between me and you
(I want love, I want love, I want love)

And I don't want to be alone
And I am scared of all the people in the world
And I have never had a home
I am too afraid so I keep moving through the world
I keep moving through the world

Change me, time will change me
Well, trust me, baby, the shit comes back
Self-sabotage or is my life on pause?
Am I inventing flaws? The shit comes back

And I don't want to be alone
And I am scared of all the people in the world
And I have never had a home
I am too afraid so I keep moving through the world
I keep moving through the world

I would like to find a place
(S- E- N- E- C- A)
Where maybe I could find some peace
(S- E- N- E- C- A)
Even if I change my name
(S- E- N- E- C- A)
Different player, same old game
(S- E- N- E- C- A)

And I don't want to be alone
And I am scared of all the people in the world
And I have never had a home
I am too afraid so I keep moving through the world
I keep moving through the world
