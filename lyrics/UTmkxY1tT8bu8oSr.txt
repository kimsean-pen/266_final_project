One day I'ma end up in a urn on a mantle
Roll my remains in a blunt, light it up smoke
I put a hex on my ex she won't Lee me lone
Cuz I made a move and never comin back home but I ain't shit but a wretched individual
Pentacle made of stone by the window
Considered one to love the devil by the sheeple
But they don't really know shit let em bleed on they mothafuckin knees let em bleed

Aye
Fuck Anton Lavey
You're the reason edgy mothafuckers are a thing
Anyone who bought your bible is a damn fake
Rest in piss I hope your followers hang

On a rope
Aye
Lookin for the antidote
Wanna break away I'm a slave to the physical
Plane

Fuck xans in my white vans can I get another tab

Or the psilocybe
I'm sick of life committing psychedelic suicide

All I ever wanted was a way to find the inner light
Re-enlightenment the way of a thelemite

Finn

Praying for my luck to change but its not looking good for me
(Show me the light I will go)

I wake
Another day and I
Can't help but wonder why
Some seem to have it all while others suffer like myself
I can't keep counting down the days until I find what it means to be at one with myself
I can't keep counting
Down the days

I am so tainted by temptation
All I wanted was to breathe
So far away from the toxins in the air of this place
I can't keep counting down the days until I find what it means to be at one with myself
I can't keep counting
Down the days

Close your eyes so tightly
So no liquid can escape
And point your chin at the sun
Keep the blackness at bay
