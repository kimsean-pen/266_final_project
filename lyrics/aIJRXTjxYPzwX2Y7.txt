Always have, always will
i was mesmerised when i first met you
wouldn't let myself believe
that you could step right out of my wildest dreams
but you didn't know
that secret part of me
until we kissed an made it open up so easily
I always have
even when it didn't show
i always will
you know that i just wanna touch you
whenever you're close to me
i always have
doesn't matter where we go
i always will
you know that i just wanna show you
just how much you mean to me
always have, always will
Everything that you give in to
everyting you'll ever need
is locked up somewhere deep inside of me
you gotta know
but more importantly
you've got to stay and hold me while we live this fantasy
I always have
even when it didn't show
i always will
you know that i just wanna touch you
whenever you're close to me
i always have
doesn't matter where we go
i always will
you know that i just wanna show you
just how much you mean to me
Sometimes we try too hard to please
we should let love come naturally
and sometimes i don't know
just what you really do to me
that is o.k.
cuz it's all part of the mystery

i always have
even when it didn't show
i always will
you know that i just wanna touch you
whenever you're close to me
i always have
doesn't matter where we go
i always will
you know that i just wanna show you
just how much you mean to me
always have, always will

i always have
even when it didn't show
i always will
you know that i just wanna touch you
whenever you're close to me
i always have
doesn't matter where we go
i always will
you know that i just wanna show you
just how much you mean to me
always have, always will
