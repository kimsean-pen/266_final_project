Woo ohh
Hello good morning
I hope I didn't wake you up while
Sneaking away to make you
Some breakfast in bed
With your favorite bowl of charms
And I can't help but stare
In your pajamas
And soft light on your shoulders
I wanna dive into your dreams
Get inside
Together we'll
Wooo I'll be your unicorn
愛に揺れ
So you can feel the rainbows
連れてくよ horizon horizon
You and me we're never coming back to reality
Baby come with me
Whatever you want we can take it slow fast
Speed of light I'll make you fly so high
Wooo I'll be your unicorn
愛に揺れ
So you can feel the rainbows
淡く溶ける合図 horizon
I love it
You want it
You got it
I need it
Wooo I'll be your unicorn
愛に揺れ
So you can feel the rainbows
連れてくよ
I'm sorry I didn't mean to wake you
So close your eyes and go on back to sleep
I just wanna say I love you
