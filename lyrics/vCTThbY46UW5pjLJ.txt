When they turn the pages of history
When these days have passed long ago
Will they read of us with sadness
For the seeds that we let grow

We turned our gaze from the castles in the distance
Eyes cast down on the path of least resistance

Cities full of hatred, fear and lies
Withered hearts and cruel tormented eyes
Scheming demons dressed in kingly guise
Beating down the multitude and scoffing at the wise

The hypocrites are slandering the sacred halls of truth
Ancient nobles showering their bitterness on youth
Can't we find the minds that made us strong
Ohh, can't we learn to feel what's right and what's wrong
What's wrong?

Cities full of hatred, fear and lies
Withered hearts and cruel tormented eyes
Scheming demons dressed in kingly guise
Beating down the multitude and scoffing at the wise

Ohh, can't we raise our eyes and make a start
Can't we find the minds to lead us closer to the heart
