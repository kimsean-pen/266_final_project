Why is it hard
To just get along
We try but we break our heads
But in my heart
I forget about
The things that lead to you

Why dont we start
To just get a long
I'll try no to make you sad
That we wont part
Just forget about
The things I said to you

All we do for love
Is it worth it
Can we prove its existance
All we do for love
Can we do it right
Like others do

Don't fall for stars (this verse is so me)
Is what you said to me
You smiled and you never left
No we're apart
And there's a lot of things
I can't admit to you

Ooh, is it so hard
To just fall in love
And fly over moonlights head
Lets make a start
And forget about
The things I did to you

All we do for love Is it worth it
Can we prove its existance
All we do for love
Can we do it right
Like others do
