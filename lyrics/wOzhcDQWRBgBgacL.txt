Iâd like to see you in the morning
In the evening but you need a warning
Iâd like to see you itâs a last ditch
Come on you gotta I ainât sayinâ thereâs not a hitch
Come on out now itâs the only
Canât think I know how
Is that all youâre gonna let me say?
Iâd like to see you and donât you miss it?
I lied again today and now I wish that
Youâd believe me when I need to
You should be weary what if I were you
Can I come along, I canât take the strain
Now what else is wrong, sure, Iâll take the blame
Iâd like to see you in the morning
In the evening but you need a warning
Iâd like to see you donât you miss it?
I lied again today now I wish that
Youâd believe me when I need to
You should be weary, I would if I were you
Can I come along, I canât take the strain
Now what else is wrong, sure, Iâll take the blame
Come on out now itâs the only way
Canât think I know how is that all youâre gonna let me say?
You got things to do
So, what else is new?
Wonât you give me some?
Bring it back for me
Wonât you come and see?
Youâre the only one
So, what else is new?
So, what else is new?
You got things to do
So, what else is new?
Wonât you give me some?
Bring it back for me
Wonât you come and see?
Youâre the only one
Youâre the only one
Youâre the only one
