Some love,

It doesn't matter if you count the numbers from the heart
And where it ends
Is that the part
Even kiss trapped in a rumours from a stolen heart
Weary heart
And where it starts
As I go

It doesn't matter if you count the numbers from the heart
And where it ends
Is that the part
Even kiss trapped in a rumours from a stolen heart, heart, heart
Weary heart
From the start

Promise you you'll start counting numbers from the start
Where it ends, from the part
Keep in mind you're just attracting numbers from the start
The starter part
Starter part
Starter part
Starter part
Starter part
Start
and start
