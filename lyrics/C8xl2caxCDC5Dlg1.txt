Wond'ring aloud
How we feel today
Last night sipped the sunset
My hand in her hair

We are our own saviours
As we start
Both our hearts
Beating life
Into each other

Wond'ring aloud
Will the years treat us well?
As she floats in the kitchen
I'm tasting the smell
Of toast as the butter runs
Then she comes
Spilling crumbs
On the bed
And I shake my head

And it's only the giving
That makes you
What you are
