We've been in this bed since
Can't remember when we crawled in
Tangled in the sheets, no
We will never leave we're all in

They say
Something is wrong with us
The pleasure and pain's too much sometimes
Trying to take what's ours

There's no point
Cause they don't understand how much
I love it, I love it
I love, I love, I love it
My parents don't like it
But I don't care it's exciting
It's different, I'd miss it
Without you, I ain't living

Cause we're one in a billion
I love, I love, I love it
I love it, I love it
I love, I love, I love it
My parents don't like it
But don't care it's exciting
It's different, I'd miss it
Without you, I ain't living
Cause we one in a billion
I love, I love, I love it

Voices in my head
They're talking me to death
It's constant
But I would never let
Them get inside my chest
I promise

They say
Something is wrong with us
The pleasure and pain's
Too much sometimes
Trying to take what's ours
There's no point

Cause they don't understand how much
I love it, I love it
I love, I love, I love it
My parents don't like it
But don't care it's exciting
It's different I'd miss it
Without you, I ain't living
Cause we one in a billion
I love, I love, I love it

I love it, I love it
I love, I love, I love it
My parents don't like it
But don't care it's exciting

It's different I'd miss it
Without you, I ain't living
Cause we one in a billion
I love, I love, I love it

I love it, I love it
I love, I love, I love it
My parents don't like it
But don't care it's exciting
It's different I'd miss it
Without you, I ain't living
Cause we're one in a billion
I love, I love, I love it
