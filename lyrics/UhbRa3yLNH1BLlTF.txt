No, it's no wonder I feel broken
Are you the one to fix me up, patching up the work they done?
Try to sew me
So thread the needle, tie it off, teach me how to trust someone

Really hoping that you stay, that you never walk away
Every word I shouldn't say, I shouldn't say, I shouldn't say it
Do you feel the stress in me, steady bursting at the seams?
You're the only one I need to make me complete, yeah

Stitch me up, stitch me up, don't tear me apart
I've been stuck in the rut, patched up in the dark
Stitch me up, stitch me up, there's pins in my heart, oh
Pardon all my precious scars

No, it's no wonder you've been feeling
Like a doll in lost and found, so mistreated, thrown around
Who you kidding?
Every flaw and every fray, that's what makes you sexy to me

Really hoping that I stay, I could never walk away
Every word we shouldn't say, we shouldn't say, we shouldn't say it
Do you feel the stress in me, steady bursting at the seams?
You're the only one I need to make me complete, yeah

Stitch me up, stitch me up, don't tear me apart
I've been stuck in the rut, patched up in the dark
Stitch me up, stitch me up, there's pins in my heart, oh
Pardon all my precious scars

Elegant and broken, tasteful, tattered clothing
I guess we've been caught in the middle of love
Motive through emotion, damaged, but we're golden
I guess we've been caught in the middle of love
Elegant and broken, tasteful, tattered clothing
I guess we've been caught in the middle of love
Motive through emotion, damaged, but we're golden
I guess we've been caught in the middle of love

Stitch me up, stitch me up, don't tear me apart
I've been stuck in the rut, patched up in the dark
Stitch me up, stitch me up, there's pins in my heart, oh
Pardon all my precious scars

Pardon all my previous scars
Stitch me up, stitch me up, there's pins in my heart, oh
Pardon all my precious scars
