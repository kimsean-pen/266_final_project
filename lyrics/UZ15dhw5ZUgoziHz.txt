Fly blue sky, voices keep calling,
Bidding me welcome.
Why maiden land,
Luring me closer, forbiden land.

And as I'm Standing closer,
Those natives step beyond.

Release the mortal patterns,
My mind I post beyond.

Spinning in circles,
Miracles happen,
As lower life shows me in to my doom,
Spirit will striken,
The end will come soon.

This is termination,
The outcome of your life...
