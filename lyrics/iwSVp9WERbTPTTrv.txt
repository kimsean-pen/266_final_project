A bruised full moon play fights with the stars
This place is our prison
Its cells are the bars
So take me to town
I wanna dance with the city
Show me something ugly,
and show me something pretty

Damn this place makes a boy out of me
The ring meets my face by the count of three

An unwanted sun pulls rank in the sky
The boxer isn't finished
He's not ready to die
I'm attracted to the light
I'm attracted to the heat
It's a violent night
There are boxers in the street

Damn this place makes a boy out of me
The ring meets my face by the count of three
And damn this place makes a boy out of me
The ring meets my face I'm a fallen oak tree

Dazed in the final count
Dazed in the final count
Dazed in the final count
Dazed in the final count
