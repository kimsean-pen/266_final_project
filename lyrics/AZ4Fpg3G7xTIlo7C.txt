Beautiful things are comin' my way
Beautiful things, I want them to stay
But after a while my beautiful things
don't seem beautiful at all
Terrible things like when you wake up
and all of your dreams seem to crack up
Like things you have done
like breakin' my heart
For you don't seem terrible at all

Is there someone I can talk to?
Someone on the line?
Does anybody want to hear what's on my mind?

Beautiful things like leaves on a tree
Beautiful things, the sky and the sea
Since you've been gone no beautiful things
seem beautiful to me

Is there someone I can talk to?
Someone out there on the line?
Does anybody want to hear what's on my mind?

Make the grass grow in the garden
when the rain is passin' by
Does anybody want to know
what's on my mind?
