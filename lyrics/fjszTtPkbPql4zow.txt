I get in the car
Another tragic disaster
But I'm safe where I am
Yet another is captured
The traffic is stopped
People just stare
(Stare stare stare stare)
Another alert
Does the kid have a prayer?
Life is not fair

It's hard to look outside my door
(Look outside my door)
With all the news reports and more
Yet I will do my part and stay on alert
(On alert)
For all the kids out there who are gettin' hurt
It could've happened to me
(Happened to me)
Can you make me believe
This could have a happy end?
'Cause I
Am one of them

I try to grow up
But I am chased by my fears
It could happen to me
And I worry in tears
Reports of the girl
Making me scared
(Scared)
Led off to die
And why was I spared?
Life is not fair

It's hard to look outside my door
(Look outside my door)
With all the news reports and more
Yet I will do my part and stay on alert
(On alert)
For all the kids out there who are gettin' hurt
It could've happened to me
(Happened to me)
Can you make me believe
This could have a happy end?
'Cause I
Am one of them

I am one of them
Am one of them
I am one of them
Am one of them
I am one of them
Am one of them
I wish I could bring
Back all of them
