Can't fight this feeling of death
When it wraps its hands around your neck
Like the pill that's underneath your tongue
Swallow it with a soft regret
And all the things that make you cry
Remembering you'll watch your parents die
And all the people that you love in your life
Find their way above the Irem Shrine

Skipping tombstones
Heavy and slow

So fall asleep with open eyes
With bad dreams to occupy my time
We're on a strict death schedule
It keeps us all in line
There's things that I'm avoiding now
Dreams about all my teeth falling out
Any floral green color scheme
Try, but you can't make a sound

And the clock keeps spinning around
And the clock keeps spinning around

Skipping tombstones
Heavy and slow
Hope that they float
No one knows how deep the bottom goes
