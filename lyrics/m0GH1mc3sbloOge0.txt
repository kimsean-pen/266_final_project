Never in the field of human affection
Had so much been given for so few attention
Never in the field of human affection
Had so much been given for so few attention

Winston boy
Oh there is packing quietly, alone
You could mistake a clock ticking
For a cricket cricketing
When you're around him
But I swear
Nobody knows
Nobody knows what's on this boys mind
And nobody sees
Nobody sees what he's been picturing

We all make a living by what we get
But we make life by what we give
By what we give
But in some special circumstances
This special circumstance
Winston boy will have to end living for he ends enough living to give
Where is your family
Where are your loved ones
Someone uttered
As he went on, crossing the channel
Well they say no man can be a prophet in his own country
So I left, here I am
Come one embrace me, hold me
I'm your brother
While as he kept on talking?? of the magnificent oh well
It's about time he embraced a guitar borrowed
Borrowed from me
Come to think about it
I think a few years ago I heard him talk about how God blessed an eagle with 54 stars
And maybe he's gone
He's gone
Wandering living for his kind of stars
But if them stars
If we think about it
If beautiful stars
They tend to shoot through the night and you never find them again
Never and never and never again
And so don't you judge Winston Boy
Don't you ever judge Winston boy
One day this boy might be the man
Though clearly nobody knows when or how
One day this boy will stand in front of??
As the world gets him by permanent
There you will tell the world where he's been and how
Underground to upper ground in the depths of??
Sureley survived
They share his story with a cup of thea streaming from his eyes
One day this boy will be fine
One day this boy will be fine
Better watch out now
That day might be today
