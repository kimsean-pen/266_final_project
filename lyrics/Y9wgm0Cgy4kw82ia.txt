Prehistoric flower on the windowsill getting hit by the sun.

Flourescent cloud hanging over top of

you, you don't know what you're saying.

How long can you be in pain?

How long?
How long can you be in pain?
How long?
Bare feet on wet griptape I'm putting in the nail.
I send it to my sister I send it to my sister.
I tell her all my secrets I tell her all my thoughts.
I shake it like a tambourine I shake it like I can.
I do a stupid drawing on the corner of the page
I love to watch it go
I love to watch it go.
Everything is changing yea everything is strange.
You spin it on your fingertip you spin it on your thumb.
Prehistoric flower on the windowsill getting hit by the sun.
Flourescnet cloud hanging over top of
you, you don't know what you're saying.
How long can you be in pain?
