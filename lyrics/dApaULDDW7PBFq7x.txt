All that which is that which shall be done
They say it's nothing new
I give my heart away to just one
And it could be only you

Like a master's baptism of fire
I know you have your ways
And two masters at once, no man can acquire
You set my heart ablaze

There's nothing new under the sun
Who owns my heart?
There can be only one

Broken down for days at a free motel
Under the Oregon ridge
Broken hearts, a lifetime in this hell
I hope it's water under theWith love it's either all or none
Who owns my heart?
There can be only one

To saints and martyrs, lovers now and foregone
We are forever committed
But as even martyrs are taught by an Imam
At least we're grown enough to admit it

All that which is that which shall be done
Who owns my heart?
There can be only one
