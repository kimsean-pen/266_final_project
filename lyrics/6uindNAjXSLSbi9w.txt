A Saturday downpour carved out rivers in the sand
she said it was her first time to see the sea
helping to clime the jetty rocks was the first time I touched her hand
and the rain and the way it felt never let up all week
by Thursday I knew everything about her
And God, the last day I didn't wanna leave without her

The sidewalks and streets were soaked and the sky was gray
but you should've seen her face, shining like that light house
through all the rain and the way she called my name
I've lived those seven days a thousand times,
those seven days a thousand times

Time was like the tide, it came and went.
That old pier ran clear out into the mist
and my mind plays that Tuesday night again and again and again
I taste that old saltwater taffy on her lips
And Wednesday morning snuck in through the window
and we just laid there and listened to the waves come and go

The sidewalks and streets were soaked and the sky was gray
but you should've seen her face, shining like that light house
through all the rain and the way she called my name
Well, I've lived those seven days a thousand times,
those seven days a thousand times
Moments with her, now there all a blur, except for every second,
every word, every drop of rain, every single grain of sand...

The sidewalks and streets were soaked and the sky was gray
but you should've seen her face, shining like that light house
through all the poring rain and the way she called my name
Well, I've lived those seven days a thousand times,
those seven days a thousand times
