Tired and lonely, still we stand
On a road to nowhere
Trapped in a world of endless days
My engine's stalling (road to nowhere)
Body and mind are breaking down
On a road to nowhere
Destiny silent, hear no sound
As away forever

Farewell, I miss you
I'm sick of these goodbyes
Because it tore us apart, right from the start
I miss you

Feelings that filled me left me cold
On this road to nowhere (road to nowhere)
Dreams are my saviors, save me now
Because I know I'm falling (oh yeah)

Farewell, I miss you
I'm sick of these goodbyes
Because it tore us apart, right from the start
I miss you

Candles burn slowly, flames shine so brightly
Light in the darkness, save me from madness again
Only the lonely, can possibly know me
Heat keeps on rising, fire engulfs me again
Keeps on rising

Farewell, I miss you
I'm sick of these goodbyes (sick of these goodbyes)
Because it tore us apart, right from the start
I miss you

Farewell, I miss you
I'm sick of these goodbyes
Because it tore us apart, right from the start (right from the start)
I miss you
