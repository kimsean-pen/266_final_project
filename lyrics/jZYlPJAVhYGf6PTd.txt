I'm alone but I'm not lonely
Comfortably indulging and trying
To get to know me

I'm just an outline of what I used
To be Constantly evolving
Steadily revolving

I'm confidently lost
I don't need you to find me
You don't difine me
I am confidently lost
I don't need you to find me
Cause I'm not hiding

Anything
Anything

Made up of hope and meditation
Love, imagination water my creation
Baby it's amazing all the days I'm facing
Nothing seems to phase me

Cause I

I'm confidently lost
I don't need you to find me
Cause I know how it is

Anything
Anything
Anything
Anything

Thinking about where I've gone
Where I'm going
I wouldn't change it for the world
Thinking about where I'm from

If I belong there
But I wouldn't change it for anything
"I wouldnt change it for anything"

Anything
Anything
Anything
