This spot, this spot
It's all for you
And even if you don't come tonight it's still for you

My eyes, these eyes these days i got for you
And even if I don't get to see you i'm envisioning all kinds of things
I stand by my reasons for wanting you
It may sound simple but for me it's new
I wanna do rigth by you
I wanna tend to your wounds
I am interested in a love that soothes
Cause i been through some rounds before when my
heart was hungering for love i couldn't let through
Baby baby baby i want it to be different with you
I stand by my reasons for wanting you
It may sound simple but for me it's new
However long we shall be listen to me
I won't make a fool of you darling
I've been the one to lose my time in
the smile of a lie i'm not looking behind
Baby I want to be different this time this time
