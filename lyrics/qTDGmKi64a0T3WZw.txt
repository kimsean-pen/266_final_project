When the rats run riot and the screen door slams,
When the trees grow quiet, nothing but cats and cans.
When the breeze says 'try it', but you can hardly see.
When your love has died, and you rat on me.

I see your eyes in the half-light,
I see the number on your wall.
Endless strange things I see at night,
You don't see anything at all.

Shine a light into your soul, city streets so freezing cold.
City shadows mark the route when they let the rats out.

Rats.
You call it love, all right.
That was the catch!
A cold suicide.

Let me place you in my past with other precious toys.
But if you're ever feeling low down in the fractured sunshine,
I'll help you feel the noise.

Shine down, you can go on home.
Shine down, go.
Go!

Rats.
You're working overtime!
You are the moon beyond your mind.

When the rats run riot and the screen door slams,
When the world goes quiet, you won't know where I am.

You could be my open road, you could be the reason why.
You could ease my heavy load, but I want to freeze you out now.

You can let it shine.
Keep that in mind.
When they let out a rat next time,
You could move a little closer,
Until you're leaning all up around my shoulder.
City shadows mark the route when they let the rats out.
