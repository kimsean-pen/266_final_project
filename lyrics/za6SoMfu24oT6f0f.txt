You stood beside me
When I was out of my mind
I broke the glass
And you where there to sweep it aside

And if you leave me
Rest assured it would kill me

I make a mess
And you'll be there to help me undress
I'll be unclean, I'll be obscene
You'll be the rest

And if you leave me
Rest assured it would kill me

Like an oleander
Like white geese
I'm an oleander
White like me

I'm like the child in a [Incomprehensible]
I play with fire, I burn you right out
I burned your bible
You try to cry, put on a smile

And if you leave me
Rest assured it would kill me
Rest assured if you
Leave

Like an oleander
Like white geese
I'm an oleander
White like me

Oh, the oleander
White, white geese
I'm an oleander
White like me
