Moonlit drive to the west side, another planet
You won't sleep until you know I got there safely
I move fast along the freeway
And I wonder about your caution
I wonder if you're happy
I wonder about your caution
I wonder if you're happy

When I stayed
You and I laid down, turned to face each other
You were over in the corner and I looked no further
When I look at you I see everyone I know but no one else
When I look at you I see this whole city

If I never left home
Would you still feel alone?
If I never left home
Would you still feel like you're alone?

Memory
At the moment I feel you looking directly at me
As I stare off at the slanted palm trees
And ruminate the perpetual strife and timing in my life
And how your foresight keeps us both in line

If I never left home
Would you still feel like you're alone?
If I never left home
Would you still feel like you're alone?
