Dim the lights so you can't see me
Close your mouth, don't speak
Just feel me, closer we become
Together we will fall than we're one
This night
This night
We give ourselves one night
The mood is set
The food is eatin'
The time is right
For love it's beatin'
A little bit of talk, a little bit of pleasure
A little bit of makin' out, and then we work it out
A little smokey smoke, tell me a dirty joke
Upon your roof
Upon your roof
And we don't need nobody, this our little party
Just us two, just us two
And we don't need nobody
Cause we go ladi dadi
Just us two
Me and you
Me and you
Feel the kiss and the smile so softly
We're just friends but I like you slightly
We won't cross the line, we'll go on proper takes some time
Just a boy and a girl, just us two in a world
The mood is set
The food is eatin'
The time is right
For love it's beatin'
A little bit of talk, a little bit of pleasure
A little bit of makin' out, and then we work it out
A little smokey smoke, tell me a dirty joke
Upon your roof
Upon your roof
And we don't need nobody, this our little party
Just us two, just us two
And we don't need nobody
Cause we go ladi dadi
Just us two
Me and you
Me and you
Take a walk with me
And we'll go dancing in the rain, and baby we'll run under a tree
I'll look at you, you'll look at me
The mood is set
The food is eatin'
The time is right
For love it's beatin'
A little bit of talk, a little bit of pleasure
A little bit of makin out, and then we work it out
A little smokey smoke, tell me a dirty joke
Upon your roof
Upon your roof
And we don't need nobody, this our little party
Just us two, just us two
And we don't need nobody
Cause we go ladi dadi
Just us two
Me and you
Me and you
