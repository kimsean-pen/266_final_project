I can't sleep, I just can't breathe
when your shadow is all over me baby
don't wanna be, a fool in your eyes
'cause what we had was built on lies
and when our love seems to fade away
listen to me hear what I say

I don't wanna feel
the way that I do
I just wanna be
right here with you
I don't wanna see
see us apart

I just wanna say it straight from my heart
I miss you...
what would it take, for you to see
to make you understand that I'll

always believe
you and I, can make it through
and I still know, I can't get over you
'cause when our love seems to fade away
listen to me hear what I say
I don't wanna feel

the way that I do
I just wanna be
right here with you
I don't wanna see
see us apart
I just wanna say it straight from my heart

oh baby I miss you, I do...
'cause when our love always
fades away
listen to me hear what I say
I don't wanna feel
the way that I do
I just wanna be
right here with you

I don't wanna see
see us apart
I just wanna say it straight from my heart
I miss you, I miss you
I do...
I don't wanna feel
the way that I do
I just wanna be
right here with you
I don't wanna see
see us apart
I just wanna say it straight from my heart
oh baby I miss you, I do...
