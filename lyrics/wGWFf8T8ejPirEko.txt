That's enough
I can't take anymore
Right out of vision
Right out of hope
You work me up
Just to tear me down
What's on your conscience?
Nothing happens in my town

I'll do graffiti if you sing to me in French
What are you doing here if romance isn't dead?
Mind your mouth as you walk with me
Take care oooh oh as you cross the street

That's enough
I've had it up to here
I've lost my vision
I've lost my hope
You work me up
Just to hand me down
You've lost your conscience
'Cause nothing happens in my town

I'll do graffiti if you sing to me in French
What are you doing here if romance isn't dead?
Stay in line on the foreign trip

Waking up
I need a lift
