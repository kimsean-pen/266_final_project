Tears don't care who cries them, they don't care at all
Any time a heart starts breaking, they will fall and fall
Rich man, poor man, beggar, tears can fill each eye
They don't care who cries them, you just cry, cry, cry

Once my love and dreams were in your keeping
Then you walked away with someone new
Once you laughed at me when I was weeping
What happened to me, has happened to you

Tears don't care who cries them but my eyes are dry
I'm laughing now while you learn how to cry, cry, cry

Once my love and dreams were in your keeping
Then you walked away with someone new
Once you laughed at me while I was weeping
What happened to me, has happened to you

Tears don't care who cries them but my eyes are dry
I'm laughing now while you learn how to cry, cry, cry
