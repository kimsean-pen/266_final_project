In a gravitational solar storm
The wandering Nibiru was caught
Disturbing the fury of the planets
Colliding with the fierce Tiamat

As the moon became the imposing
Eternal night star of the Earth
Lead the infernal tides of genocide
Blown unto the seas of holocaust

Cast out from the void of infinity
Through the whirlwind of the Annunaki
Savage ancestral humanity
The blow divine, the spawn of the humanoid

Violent gods were praised
To serve and to exterminate
The rise and fall
Of a existence dominated

The hours of life's extensions
Relentlessly brought from distant dimensions
The origin of the soul, the flesh of sinful deeds
The carnage of infestation
Travelled from vengeful spheres
Promised to breed into annihilation
Souls of black entangled to madness
Wandering through eternity, relentless

Catastrophic days, to cleanse the ways
Savior's betrayed, procreation untamed
The curses in numbers, numbers in curses
Damned were the supernatural forces

Pyramids of brutal sacrificial rites, ethereal revocations
Altars of bleeding, offers undead, sacred assassinations
Stairways of streams of blood to heavens enthroned
Knife of stone reaps the heart of the overthrown

In a gravitational solar storm
The wandering Nibiru was caught
Disturbing the fury of the planets
Colliding with the fierce Tiamat
