I can settle down and be doin' just fine
Til' I hear an old train rollin' down the line
Then I hurry straight home and pack
And if I didn't go, I believe I'd blow my stack

I love you baby, but you gotta understand
When the Lord made me, he made a Ramblin' Man

Well, some folks might say that I'm no good
That I wouldn't settle down if I could
But when that open road starts to callin' me
There's somethin' o'er the hill that I gotta see

Sometimes it's hard but you gotta understand
When the Lord made me, He made a Ramblin' Man

And let me travel this land from the mountains to the sea
Cause that's the life I believe, He meant for me
And when I'm gone and at my grave, you stand
Say God's called home your Ramblin' Man
