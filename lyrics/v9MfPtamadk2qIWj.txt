Vanish into the night with me
We're rasing heartbeats
Feel the power arrest me
Like shadows on concrete
(shadows on concrete)

Gotta get away, gotta escape
From the daylight
I can see the way painted beneath the moon

Hold on for dear life
Until it's all gone, we'll come alive
And set fear on fire
We'll set fear on fire

Hold on for dear life
Until it's all gone, we'll come alive
And set fear on fire
We'll set fear on fire

Awaken in the dark with me
We're taking over
(we're taking over)
Feel the rush feel this
Well at least like animals unleash
(animals unleash)

Gotta get away, gotta escape
From the daylight
I can see the way painted beneath the moon

Hold on for dear life
Until it's all gone, we'll come alive
And set fear on fire
We'll set fear on fire

Hold on for dear life
Until it's all gone, we'll come alive
And set fear on fire
We'll set fear on fire

Hold on for dear life
Until it's all gone, we'll come alive
And set fear on fire
We'll set fear on fire

Hold on for dear life
Until it's all gone, we'll come alive
And set fear on fire
We'll set fear on fire
