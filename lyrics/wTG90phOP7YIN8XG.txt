And here we go again
With all the things we said
And not a minute spent
To think that we'd regret
So we just take it back
These words and hold our breath
Forget the things we swore we meant

I'll write you just to let you know
That I'm all right
Can't say I'm sad to see you go
'Cause I'm not
No, I'm not
Well, I'm not

And here we go again
With all the things we did
And now I'm wondering
Just who would I have been
To be the one attached
At all times to your hip
Forget the things we sworn we meant

I'll write you just to let you know
That I'm all right
Can't say I'm sad to see you go
'Cause I'm not
No, I'm not
Well, I'm not
No, I'm not
No, I'm not

I'll write you to let you know
That I'm all right
Can't say I'm sad to see you go
'Cause I'm not
No, I'm not
Well, I'm not
No, I'm not
I'm not
I'm not

And here we go again
With all the things we said
And not a minute spent
To think that we'd regret
So we just take it back
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
(I'm not)
