You're looking for an excuse
Just to come out and play
If I tell you I'm dying
Convince me I'm okay

Baby you're too high
Baby you're too high
Baby you're too high
Too High
Baby please don't die
Baby please don't die
Baby please don't die
Tonight

The pills bring out your demons
The spirits grasp your soul
You're going off the deep end
And deeper in your hole

Baby you're too high
Baby you're too high
Baby you're too high
Too High
Baby please don't die
Baby please don't die
Baby please don't die
Tonight

Baby you're too high
Baby you're too high
Baby you're too high
Too High
Baby please don't die
Baby please don't die
Baby please don't die
Tonight
