Could you come over?
Could you come over?
I'm feeling blue
What will you do?
You could come over
You could come over
I'm feeling bad
I'm feeling sad

Then I see the rose
I see the glory in your eyes
And winter comes, and then it snows
I see the glory in your eyes
I'm feeling lost
I see the rose
I see the glory in your eyes
And winter comes, and then it snows

I see the glory in your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes

Do you remember?
Late in september

A Banshee cry
When someone dies
Sleeping in silence
While I'm dreaming
It's all in my mind
The beauty I find

Lost, I see the rose
I see the glory in your eyes
And winter comes, and then it snows
I see the glory in your eyes
I'm feeling lost
I see the rose
I see the glory in your eyes
And winter comes, and then it snows
I see the glory in your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
