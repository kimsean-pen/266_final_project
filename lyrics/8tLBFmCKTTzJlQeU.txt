Yeah, I'm on my way, on my way to Hell
Burnt up a dog and got away with it
But some of them say that's where the Lord kicks in, but I say:

How hard does he kick then, huh?
Uh, you know he better kick me good
I'm off to Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Sugar Town

Yeah, I'm on my way, on my way to Hell
But I think I'll live for a few more days
And just when I think that it's time to go, I say:

Hell only exists if you believe in God, right?
So, that makes me a ghost when I die, right?
I call that Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Sugar Town

(dadadadadada)

But I say:
How hard does he kick then, huh?
Uh, you know he better kick me good
I'm off to Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Sugar Town
