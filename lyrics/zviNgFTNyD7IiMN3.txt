Hey, baby, tell me your name
I got a fever for you, I just can't explain
But there's just one problem, I'm a bit old school
When it comes to lovin' I ain't chasing you
Ain't waiting I'm on a roll
You've got to let yourself go

Oh, you know that I've been waiting for you
Don't leave me standing all by myself
'Cause I ain't looking at no one else

Hey, get your back off the wall, don't you get comfortable
Looking so hot, I think that I might fall (Woo!)
Feeling like it's my birthday like Christmas day came early
Just what I want, so when we move
You move

Hey, get your back off the wall, don't you get comfortable
Looking so hot, I think that I might fall
Feeling like it's my birthday like Christmas day came early
Just what I want, so when we move
You move

Oh silly, why you afraid?
Don't be a big baby, quit playing games
Put your arms around me, you know what to do
And we can take it down low

Oh, you know that I've been waiting for you
Don't leave me standing all by myself
'Cause I ain't looking at no one else

Hey, get your back off the wall, don't you get comfortable
Looking so hot, I think that I might fall (Woo!)
Feeling like it's my birthday like Christmas day came early
Just what I want, so when we move
You move

Hey, get your back off the wall, don't you get comfortable
Looking so hot (yeah!), I think that I might fall
Feeling like it's my birthday like Christmas day came early
(Early! Yeah) Just what I want, so when we move
You move

I know that you wanna but you can't
'Cause you gotta stay cool in the corner
When the truth is that you wanna move, so move
I know that you wanna but you can't
'Cause you gotta stay cool in the corner
When the truth is that you wanna move, so move

Move it, baby, oh!
You know that I've been waiting for you, ooh!)
Don't leave me standing all by myself
Cause I ain't looking at no one else
Looking at no one else, looking at no one else

Hey! Hey! I'm ready
Hey! Boy come and get me
Don't be scared, show me what you do
Don't you know a girl like a boy who moves?
Hey! Hey! I'm ready
