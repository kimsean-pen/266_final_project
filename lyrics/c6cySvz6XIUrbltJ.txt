My time coming, any day, don't worry about me, no
Been so long, I felt this way
I'm in no hurry, no
Rainbows and down that highway where ocean breezes blow
My time coming, voices saying they tell me where to go

Don't worry about me, nah, nah, nah
Don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry, nah, nah, nah
I know where to go

California, preaching on the burning shore
California, I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel, standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise, I know, I'm gonna shine

My time coming, any day, don't worry about me, no
It's gonna be just like they say, them voices tell me so
Seems so long I felt this way and time sure passin' slow
Still I know I lead the way, they tell me where I go

Don't worry about me, nah, nah, nah
Don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry, nah, nah, nah
I know where to go

California, a prophet on the burning shore
California, I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel, standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise, I know I'm gonna shine

You've all been asleep, you would not believe me
Them voices tellin' me, you will soon receive me
Standin' on the beach, the sea will part before me
Fire wheel burning in the air

You will follow me and we will ride to glory
Way up, the middle of the air
And I'll call down thunder and speak the same

And my work fills the sky with flame
And might and glory gonna be my name
And men gonna light my way

My time coming, any day, don't worry about me, no
It's gonna be just like they say, them voices tell me so
Seems so long I felt this way and time sure passin' slow
My time coming, any day, don't worry about me, no

Don't worry about me, nah, nah, nah
Don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry, nah, nah, nah
I know where to go
