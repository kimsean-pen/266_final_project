Genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
Sounds go through muscles
These abstract worthless movements
Move, move, move, move, move

They start off as cells
That haven't been touched before
These cells are virgins

My headphones
They saved my life
Your tape
It lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep

Nothing will be the same
I'm asleep
I'm fast asleep

I like this resonance
It elevates me
I don't recognize myself
This is very interesting

My headphones
They saved my life
Your tape
It lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep

I'm fast asleep now
You're still listening

[Foreign content]
I'm fast asleep, I'm asleep

My headphones
They saved, saved my life
Your tape
It lulled me to sleep, to sleep, to sleep
