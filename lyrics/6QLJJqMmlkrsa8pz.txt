Ain't no talkin' to this man
Ain't no pretty other side
Ain't no way to understand
The stupid words of pride

It would take an acrobat
But I already tried all that
So I'm gonna let him fly
Gonna let him fly

Things can move at such a pace
The second hand just waved goodbye
You know the light has left his face
But you can't recall just where or why?

So there was really nothing to it
I just went and cut right through it
I said, I'm, I'm gonna let him fly

There's no mercy in a live wire
No rest at all in freedom
Of the choices we are given
It's no choice at all

The proof is in the fire
You touch before it moves away
Yeah, yeah, but you must always know
How long to stay and when to go

And there ain't no talkin' to this man
He's been tryin' to tell me so
It took awhile to understand
The beauty of just letting go

'Cause it would take an acrobat
I already tried all that
I'm gonna let him fly
Oh, I'm gonna let him fly, fly

Oh, I'm gonna let him fly, fly
I'm gonna let him fly
