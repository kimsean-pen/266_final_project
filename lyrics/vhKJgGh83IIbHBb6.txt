The hating, it's pooled inside of me
They're trying to test my sanity
Insinuating, it's all make believe
And they're ripping the child within me

Cheating the time that I have left
Bleeding my soul cause that's the bet
Giving all that that I can give
Controlling my mind that is disease
Holding my hate that is released
Scolding the hand that keeps me fed
That keeps me fed

Fed!
That keeps me fed!
Fed!
That keeps me!

I feel it all come crashing down on me
I feel alone and torn apart
I wasted time to let it get to me
An angry mouth with a broken heart

Searching for something that is safe
Hurting my pride that is the test
Turning my anger towards your flesh
Rotting, we hold the anger back
Spilling the blood that's on the bed
Scolding, the hand that keeps me fed
That keeps me fed

Fed!
That keeps me fed!

I feel it all come crashing down on me
I feel alone and torn apart
I wasted time to let it get to me
An angry mouth with a broken heart

The hating, it's pooled inside of me
They're trying to test my sanity
Insinuating, it's all make believe
And they're ripping the child from within me
The hating, it's pooled inside of me
They're trying to test my sanity
Insinuating, it's all make believe
And they're ripping the child from within me

NO!
NO!
NO!
NO!
NO!
