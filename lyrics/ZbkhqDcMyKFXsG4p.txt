i watched your cheeks flush, colored by an air from a calgary cold front
your breath made ghosts spill into the night,
and gather as if they might not disappear.

i had heard a rumor you were moving back home!

but even if it was true, i did not expect to hear it from you so bluntly.

so it hung in the air like a fever, or a slow moving front
and i would not find shelter here, so i braced myself

"out!" i cried, "out!
are you running to or are you running from?
or does it even matter if it won't change your mind?"

when you put you hand on mine,
i knew.
