Cause the world stops
When I put my arms
Around ya, around ya (Oh whoa)
Nothing even matters (eh)
Nothing even matters

It's like 1 for the haters,
2 for all of those
Who try to shut us down
They don't really know
There ain't nothing
They ai'nt nothing that can tear us apart (no)
I don't care about the money
Don't care about the clothes
When we're together
Baby anything goes

We don't even need to prove
What we feel in our hearts (no)
This wall we built together
There ain't no way of knocking it over
And we'll be here forever
Getting closer and closer baby

Cause the world stops
When I put my arms
Around ya, around ya (Oh whoa)
Nothing even matters (eh)
Nothing even matters

They can all talk
Say what they want
About us, about us (oh whoa)
Nothing even matters (eh)
Whoa
Nothing even matters

It's like the sound goes off
And the people all freeze
They disappear
And it's just you and me
Anything you wanna do
Anything that you please

Forget about our problems
Forget about our past
I've seen the future
And I know it gonna last
Every second I'm with you just go so fast (whoa whoa)
This wall we built together
There's ain't no way no knocking it over
We'll be here forever
That I told ya
That I told ya baby

Cause the world stops
When I put my arms
Around ya, around ya (Oh whoa)
Nothing even matters (eh)
Nothing even matters

They can all talk
Say what they want
About us, about us (oh whoa)
Nothing even matters (eh)
Whoa
Nothing even matters

Nothing even matters (whoa)
And nothing even matters
Whoa

We don't even need to fight
Everything will be alright
Nothing even matters
But you and I

Cause the world stops
When I put my arms
Around ya, around ya (Oh whoa)
Nothing even matters (eh)
Nothing even matters (whoa)

They can all talk
Say what they want
(Say what they want)
About us, about us (oh whoa)
Nothing even matters (eh)
Whoa
Nothing even matters
And nothing even matters (whoa)
Nothing even matters

Cause the world stops
When I put my arms
Around ya, around ya (Oh whoa)
And nothing even matters (eh)
Nothing even matters (whoa)

They can all talk
Say what they want
About us, about us (oh whoa)
And nothing even matters
Whoa
Nothing even matters
