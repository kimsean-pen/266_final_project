One, two
One two three four!

I pour the Hen all the time
She say she rather do wine
I say it's grapes either way
Plus I heard about you through the grapevine, yeah
I'm hardly ever alone
More lonely than ever before
I need a reason to coo
Plus I got this Riesling on cool, ice

(Oh) You know you the only one that got that spick and span
That clean me up, I pick you up
I pick you, gimme that spitshine

Okay, I sprayed the cologne
Blew down some trees on the way
I heard you got that typhoon
Guess we quite alike
Keep you up all night
She took the ring off her hand
I took the ring off my phone
Jumped in the ring, round two
Knocked my lights out fast
'Fore them headlights flash
Uh oh, I gotta dash
I, I, I gotta grab a lot of cash
Before I mmm my bad you know ol' dude gon' fume
I hear the g-g-ga-g-gas
Woo, my bad, don't gag
Although it's cute that you choosin' me over breathin'
See you a week from this evening
We usually keep it so briefly
Reach for my briefs, CPR
That mouth to mouth recessitation
Make it clap, crowd participation
You know the play already like Madea in it
Each and every time that we up in it
No fatigue, no weakness, only strength

Yadayadayadayadayaaa
You know you the only one who got that spick and span
That clean me up, I pick you up
I pick you, gimme that spitshine
Later on I disappear, I vamos, scram o scram
Out the jam, I'll hit ya, hit ya, hit ya
When I when I need that
Spitshine

And it could be a hunnit days
'Fore you see me
I need that memory
Alopecia, toss me the scalp, bae
Pledge allegiance, hands on ya chest
Right on ya desk, that homework
That grown work
But lay on my knee
I brought you a gift, bae
South Pole, I'm Santa Chris lady
Ice cold, hope I don't forget ya name
Blame the smoke
Blaze like a chimney
