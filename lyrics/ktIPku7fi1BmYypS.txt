Dead stars are burning in the sky
Their light reflecting in your eyes
And here the ravens they don't show
Where I've been, you don't want to know

And when I go upstream
I'll meet you in a dream
And as I try to land
Please let me hold your hand

Our ship exploded in the sky
A strong reflection in my mind
And now the secrets they won't show
I'm stuck here, won't you let me go

And when I go upstream
I'll meet you in a dream
And as I try to land
Please let me hold your hand
