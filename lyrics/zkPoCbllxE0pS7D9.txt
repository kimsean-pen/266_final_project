Ruined it all away
I couldn't see
That no one is a customer until they pay a fee
All of the fall was mine
I couldn't feel
But I know if I slip away you'll be the one to squeal

Zero
That's the number that you get from me
They all begin whenever I'm falling down again

5 and a half is all
Nothing to see
But it's me, a collectible I never claimed to be
Every piece of me
As dull as you say
But so long as I never know I'll never go away

Zero
That's the number that you get from me
They all begin whenever I'm falling down again
Zero
That's the number that you get from me
Their call begins whenever I'm falling down again

That's the number that you get from me
Their call begins whenever I'm falling down again
Zero
That's the number that you get from me
Their call begins whenever I'm falling down again

They always seem to linger
It's always the narrow ones who'll say that somet hing is off
They overlook you or refuse
But the undertow is only lost time
So rise above the low
