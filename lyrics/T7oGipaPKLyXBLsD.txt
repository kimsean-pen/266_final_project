Somebody's watchin' me, is it just a crazy dream?
Is it my memory playin' tricks on me?
Out in the streets in the heat of the city, here comes the night
Sky's turning gray and black, you knew that you were right

Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes or I'll be there
Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes or I'll be there

Just a shadow in the dark, you've seen this face before
Is it just a fantasy, is he comin' back for more?
Out in the alleyways, there is no second chance
Movin' up behind you, you've lost the game at last

Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes or I'll be there
Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes or I'll be there

Don't close your eyes

Somebody's watchin' me, is it just a crazy dream?
Is it my memory playin' tricks on me?

Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes or I'll be there
Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes or I'll be there

Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes or I'll be there
Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes or I'll be there

Don't close your eyes
