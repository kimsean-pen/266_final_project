Everywhere someone's getting over
Everybody cries, and sometimes
You can still lose even if you really try
Talking 'bout the dream like the dream is over
Talk like that won't get you nowhere
Everybody's trusting in the heart
Like the heart don't lie

But that's all that I need, yeah
Someone else to cling to, well
Someone I can lean on until
I don't need to
Just stay all through the night
And in the morning let me down
'Cause that's all that I need right now

Everywhere someone's getting over
Everybody's lied to someone
People still use other people
With a crooked smile
All around the world
There's a sinking feeling
Out there right now someone's really
Down on themselves
And don't know why
Every night

And that's all that I need, yeah
Someone else to cling to, well
Someone I can lean on until
I don't need to
Just stay all through the night
And in the morning let me down
'Cause that's all that I need right now

Life ain't no
Beauty show
We don't know where tomorrow ends
And when we're sad
It's kind of a drag

Just stay all through the night
And in the morning let me down
Yeah, 'cause that's all that I need
That's all that I need, yeah
That's all that I need
Right now
Right now
