When I see her eyes look into my eyes
and I realize that she could see inside my head.
So I closed my eyes thinking that I could hide.
Dissassociate so I don't have to lose my head.
This situation leads to agitation.
Will she cut me off?
Will this be an amputation?

I don't know if I care.
I'm the jerk.
Life's not fair.
Fighting all the time, this is out of line.
She loves me not, loves me not.
Do you realize? I won't compromise.
She loves me not, loves me not.

Over the past five years.
I have shed my tears.
I have drank my beers and watched my fears fly away.
And until this day she still swings this way
but it's sad to say, sometimes she says she loves me not.
But I hesitate to tell her I hate this relationship.
I want out today this is over.

I don't know if I care.
I'm the jerk.
Life's not fair.
Fighting all the time, this is out of line.
She loves me not, loves me not.
Do you realize? I won't compromise.
She loves me not, loves me not.
Life's not fair.
I'm the jerk.

Line for line, rhyme for rhyme.
Sometimes we'll be fighting, all the god damn time.
It's makin me sick, relationship is gettin', I'll piss drunk stupid mad.
On the real could you feel what I feel?
What's the deal girl?
Tearin up each other's words.
We should be in harmony, boy and girl.
That is a promis we made.
Back in the day.
We told each other things, wouldn't be this way.
I think we should work this out.
It's alright baby, we can scream and shout.

I don't know if I care.
I'm the jerk.
Life's not fair.
Fighting all the time, this is out of line.
She loves me not, loves me not.
Do you realize? I won't compromise.
She loves me not, loves me not.
Life's not fair!
Life's not fair!
Life's not fair!
I'm the jerk!
Life's not fair.
She loves me not, loves me not.
