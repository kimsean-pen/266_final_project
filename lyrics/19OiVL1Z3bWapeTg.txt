Where is the missing one, the missing one
Where is the missing one, the missing one

There is a missing person that Ive just got to find
Now just how long they have been gone
I cant say at this time
I glanced outside my window surprisingly to see
The reflection of a broken man who looked somewhat like me

Im trying to find my Whereabouts, what shall I do
When nothing seems to follow through
In me, trying to find my Whereabouts, Im turning blue
But wait I may have found a clue
My Whereabouts are somewhere in yesterday with you

Where is the missing one, the missing one
I looked inside an album of happy photographs
To try to match the feeling
In the joy I used to have
I travelled through the moments that held a special place
But everytime what came to mind is that smile upon your face

Im trying to find my Whereabouts, what shall I do
When nothing seems to follow through
In me, trying to find my Whereabouts, Im turning blue
But wait I may have found a clue
My Whereabouts are somewhere in yesterday with you

Where is the missing one, the missing one

Im trying to find my Whereabouts, what shall I do
When nothing seems to follow through
In me, trying to find my Whereabouts, Im turning blue
But wait I may have found a clue
My Whereabouts are somewhere lost in yesterday with you

Im trying to find my Whereabouts, what can I do
When nothing seems to follow through
In me, trying to find my Whereabouts, Im turning blue
But wait I may have found a clue
My Whereabouts are somewhere lost in yesterday with you

Where is the missing one, the missing one
