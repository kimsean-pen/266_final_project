Aint no big thing
To wait for the bell to ring
Aint no big thing
The toll of the bell

Aggravated, spare for days
I troll downtown the red light place
Jump up bubble up, what's in store
Love is the drug and I need to score
Showing out, showing out, hit and run
Boy meets girl as beat goes on
Stitched up tight, can't break free
Love is the drug, got a hook on me

Oh oh catch that buzz
Love is the drug Im thinking of
Oh oh can't you see
Love is the drug for me
Oh oh, oh oh

Late that night I park my car
Stake my place in the singles bar
Face to face, toe to toe
Heart to heart as we hit the floor
Lumber up, limbo down
The locked embrace, the stumble round
I say go, she say yes
Dim the lights, you can guess the rest

Oh oh catch that buzz
Love is the drug Im thinking of
Oh oh can't you see
Love is the drug, got a hook in me
Oh oh catch that buzz
Love is the drug Im thinking of
Oh oh can't you see
Love is the drug for me
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh

Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
Love is, love is, love is the drug
