Y'all pretty ladies around the world
Got a weird thing to show ya
So tell all the boys and girls
Tell your brother, your sister and your mama too
We're about to go down and you know just what to do
Wave your hands in the air like you don't care
Glide by the people as they stop to look and stare
Do your dance, do your dance
Do your dance quick
Mama, come on baby tell me what's the word

Word up
(Up, up)
Everybody say
When you hear the call you've got to get it underway
Word up
(Up, up)

It's the code word

No matter where you say it, you know that you'll be heard

Now all you sucker DJs, who think you're fly
There's got to be a reason and we know the reason why
You try to put on those airs, and act real cool
But you've got to realize that you're acting like fools
If it's music we can use it
Be free to dance

We don't have the time for psychological romance
No romance, no romance,

No romance for me
Mama, come on baby tell me what's the word

Word up
(Up, up)

Everybody say
When you hear the call you've got to get it underway
Word up

(Up, up)
It's the code word
No matter where you say it, you know that you'll be heard

Word up
(Up, up)
Everybody say
When you hear the call you've got to get it underway

Word up
(Up, up)
It's the code word
No matter where you say it, you know that you'll be heard

Word up
(Up, up)
Everybody say
When you hear the call you've got to get it underway
Word up
(Up, up)
It's the code word
No matter where you say it, you know that you'll be heard
