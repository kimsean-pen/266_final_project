We've been talking awhile
looking at everything bright
wrote and she asks me, I'm fine
don't let me go

there came a time when you where the only one
you were the only one
the only one

maybe i could be your only price
maybe you would light it wide
even when I've fallen back, you still believe i tried

maybe we could be a symphony
and maybe i could learn to play
you could ride that story
while i just ride the wave

we're at the end of the line
she keeps me from holding her hight
trying to make sure she's fine
don't let me go
We took hundred steps back
how you said goodbye was sad
now when i think of it add, "please let me go"

there came a time when you where the only one
you were the only one
the only one

maybe i could be your only price
maybe you would light it wide
even when I've fallen back, you still believe i tried

maybe we could be a symphony
and maybe i could learn to play
you could ride that story
while i just ride the wave

but life is never like that, But life is never like that
she took me in and now i feel, still know lives never like that
life's never like that, life's never like that

maybe i could be your only price
maybe you would light it wide
even when I've fallen back, you still believe i tried

maybe we could be a symphony
and maybe i could learn to play
you could ride that story
while i just ride the wave
