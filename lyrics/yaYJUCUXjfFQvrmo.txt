I remember times
Stupid little dramas
They consumed my mind
Now's there only laughter

I remember times
Stupid little dramas
They consumed my mind
Now's there only laughter

I couldn't see what we had, I was broken
Once before, it was hard, unspoken
Hidden in the darkness
Looking for that first fix to pull me out
It's better now

Feelings getting stronger
I no longer wonder
What results from you and I
And now the pages getting thicker
Look into the mirror
Now I start to come alive

I remember times
Stupid little dramas
They consumed my mind
Now's there only laughter

I remember times
Stupid little dramas
They consumed my mind
Now's there only laughter

I remember times
Stupid little dramas
They consumed my mind
Now's there only laughter
I remember times
Stupid little dramas
They consumed my mind
Now's there only laughter

Would've gave, given you, baby anything
Want to see how, just how deep our love could be
Has to show me many hearts
But too many low lows is nothing like
What happens now?

No longer alone
Baby make me feel whole
This is how supposed to be
Its always been here since the first night
Had you make it so bright
Maybe it's our destiny

I remember times
Stupid little dramas
They consumed my mind
Now's there only laughter

I remember times
Stupid little dramas
They consumed my mind
Now's there only laughter

Laughter ...

I remember times
I remember times
Stupid little dramas
They consumed my mind

We did it together
We did it together (I remember times, stupid little dramas)
We did it together (I remember times)
We did it together (they consumed my mind)
