Home again
Home again
One day I know
I'll feel home again
Born again
Born again
One day I know
I'll feel strong again

I lift my head
Many times I've been told
All this talk will make you old
So I close my eyes
Look behind
Moving on, moving on
So I close my eyes

Look behind

Moving on
Lost again
Lost again
One day I know
Our Paths will Cross again
Smile again

Smile again
One day I hope

To make you smile again
I won't hide
Many times I've been told
Speak your mind, just be bold
So I close my eyes
Look behind
Moving on, moving on

So I close my eyes
And the tears will clear
Then I feel no fear

Then I'd feel no way
My paths will remain straight
Home again
Home again

One day I know
I'll feel home again
Home again
Home again

One day I know
I'll feel strong again
I lift my head
Many times I've been told
All this talk will make you old
So I close my eyes
Look behind
Moving on, moving on
So I close my eyes
Look behind
Moving on
