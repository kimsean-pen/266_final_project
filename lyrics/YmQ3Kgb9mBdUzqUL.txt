We ain't got no name, no we ain't got no name
We're rough I understand, cause the status here to claim
Want in my hand, don't want it in my head
Searching for a win and a battle's on the way
Hustle make you high, high, hustle make you low
Say I want, say I want, what I want they'll never know
Hustle make you high, high, hustle make you low
All I know, all I know, all I got will make you go
Always still game, we don't want the fame (We don't want it)
All I want, the fame (We don't want it)
I sing, we all sing (We don't want it)
We don't want the fame (We don't want it)
We don't want the fame
We don't got no shame, no we don't got no shame
And look we got a plan, say we never play the game
Far is in the sand, so our hearts can be mislead
We're headed through they lane, holding close to what we said
Hustle make you high, high, hustle get you low
Here it come, hold it tight, somehow we still let it go
Hustle make you high, high, hustle get you low
I don't want, I don't want, maybe just a little gold
Oh we really want the same you and I down low
Oh, oh, we really want the fame fame
Oh we really want the same you and I high low, low
We don't go for fame, fame
