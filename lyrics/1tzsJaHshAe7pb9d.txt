Arise, arise in failure, failure
Forgiven for the all, the all

This dead space inside of me it bleeds me dry
This dark space has finally made up its mind
Drifting from my mistakes as I fall away
To outrun the hurricane that trails behind

I'm made to face this shame I have
Tripping on the same beliefs that I once had
I'm made to face this shame I have
Wishing I could turn away and take it all back

Arise, arise in failure, failure
Our bones are made to rot, to rot
The lost, the damned, the broken traitors
Forgiven for the all, the all

In my mind alone shadows watching me fall
Down this hollowed hole to insanity
This dead space inside of me it bleeds me dry
This dark space has finally made up its mind
Drifting from my mistakes as I fall away
To outrun the hurricane that trails behind

Face the guilt
I turned away but they just forced my hand
Enough, enough
Find the will to put away the past and just repent
We must, we must

As I slip out of place
An eclipse masks my face
And I can't fabricate
A new name on this grave

Face the guilt
I turned away but they just forced my hand
Corrupt, corrupt
Find the will to put away the past and just repent
We must, we must

Even when you find yourself alone, alone

Arise, arise in failure, failure
Our bones are made to rot, to rot
The lost, the damned, the broken traitors
Forgiven for the all, the all

Face the guilt
I turned away but they just forced my hand
Enough, enough
Find the will to put away the past and just repent
We must, we must
