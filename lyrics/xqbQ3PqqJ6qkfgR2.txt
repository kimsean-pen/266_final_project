I've been singing
With my tongue, black tongue
I've been breathing
With my lung, black lung
Oh reckless abandon
Loaded gun, black gun
I've been grieving
For all that is gone, he's gone
I've been singing
With my lung, black lung
I've been aiming
At the sun, black sun
Oh present depressants
On my tongue, black tongue
I feel so old
But so young, so young
I've been breathing
With my lung, black lung
I've been staring
At the sun, black sun
Oh tasting the rain
With my tongue, black tongue
I've been leaving
Everyone, I've gone
People want to know
How we sleep at night
We don't, we don't, we don't
