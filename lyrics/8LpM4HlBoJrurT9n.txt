And if you're hurting
I will replace the noise with silence instead
Flushing out your head

If you like it violent
We can play rough and tumble
Fall into bed
And I won't breed for you can recover

When you're in pieces
Just follow the echo of my voice
It's okay
Tune into that frequency

Don't fight your reflex
Embrace the instinct
You can feel your way
Through the bed that we face in the end

'cause it breaks my heart
That we live this way
I know people need love
'cause them people never play the game
And we talk the talk
We communicate
The people need love
Those people never play the game

Pleasure for pleasure
It eases consequence
And love for a fall
But I know you love to take a risk

The past is weakness
Don't beg the question when the answer is war
There are moments when I'm overcomed

'cause it breaks my heart
That we live this way
I know people need love
'cause them people never play the game
And we talk the talk
We communicate
Them people need love
Those people never play the game

And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
I'm afraid to need love.
