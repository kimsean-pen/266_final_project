I'm sitting down here, but hey you can't see me

Your words cut rather deeply, they're just some other lies
I'm hiding from a distance, I've got to pay the price
Defending all against it, I really dont know why
You're obsessed with all my secrets, you always make me cry
You seem to wanna hurt me, no matter what I do
I'm telling just a couple, but somehow it gets to you
But I've learned how to get revenge, and I swear you'll experience that some day

I'm sitting down here, but hey, you cant see me
Kinda invisible, you don't sense my stay
Not really hiding, not like a shadow
Just thought I would join you for one day

I'm sitting down here, but hey, you can't see me

I'm trying not to avoid you, just dont wanna hear your voice
When you call me up so often, I really don't have a choice
You're talking lie you know me, and wanna be my friend
But thats really too late now, I won't try it once again
You may think that I'm loser, that I don't really care
You may think that it's all forgotten, but you should be aware
'Cause I've learned to get revenge, and I swear you'll experience that some day

I'm sitting down here, but hey, you can't see me
Kinda invisible, you don't sense my stay
Not really hiding, not like a shadow
Just thought I would join you for one day

I'm sitting down here, but hey, you can't see me
Kinda invisible, you don't sense my stay
Not really hiding, not like a shadow
Just thought I would join you for one day
