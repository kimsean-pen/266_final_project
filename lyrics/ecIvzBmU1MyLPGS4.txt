You took your hits with the bruises on the soles of your feet
Well, who's to say if they're deserved? But you're turning reckless now
I hear you saying through your teeth that you'll take them down first

But I saw you flinch when the doctors got their claws in you
I saw your smile start to crack
It's not so funny when you're sunk and there ain't nothing you can do
And your options are all dead ends

But there's no way out
I'll let you build your home with me till the clocks run down
When your looks run out
Call me and I will come and fix you, get your feet on the ground
When there's no way out
Call me and I will come and bury you, all safe and sound

And all this time you've been drifting out with the tide, my friend
But you can have what's mine if it helps you stay afloat
If I close my eyes I can't watch you drown anymore, my friend
But I'll tell you lies if it helps you sleep at night
And the more we fight, the more we don't get right, my friend
And the more we fight, the more we don't get right

Heard they broke you
That you gave in
That you dropped
And the fight had left you

But don't you worry
Makes no difference
From the start
Your options were all dead ends

When there's no way out
I'll let you build your home with me till the clocks run down
When your looks run out
Call me and I will come and fix you, get your feet on the ground
When there's no way out
Call me and I will come and bury you, all safe and sound
