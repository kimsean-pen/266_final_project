I've got tree tops under my head
I've got seasons under my bed
I've got troubles in the nighttime
troubles in the daytime too

I've got sand dunes in-between my toes
I've got hilltops shadowing my woes
I've got troubles in the nighttime
troubles in the daytime too
I've got troubles in the nighttime
troubles in the daytime blues

Did you not know
that I was ready to go
I said I would be there for you
Did you not know
that I was ready to go
I said I would be there for you

I've got tree tops under my head
I've got seasons under my bed
I've got troubles in the nighttime
troubles in the daytime too
I've got troubles in the nighttime
troubles in the daytime blues
