drown the stale
owning stares
all around, all around
let them crawl

pull my hair
cause it hurts, oh it hurts to let you in

in the citadel
recall the pieces, the pieces
cause it's hurts me
oh it hurts to let you in

in the dawn of my wake
in the calm of my state
oh it hurts me yes it hurts to let you in

but i won't make a sound
when the crowd comes to call
oh cause it hurts, yes it hurts to let you in

and i would be nothing
yeah and i'd be nothing
without your fear
cause i've got no war
the day it wears thin
and i've got no war
the day it goes away

oh it hurts me yes it hurts to let you in
oh it kills me oh and i don't want to give it in anymore
no i don't, no i don't want to give it in anymore
i don't want to give it in anymore
