the worst is all upon me
feeling really bad
like i said
who can give me only reason why
who can tell me if i should stay or go
well i'm a voodoo player
and the worst is all upon me
like i said
and if you'll ever hold my hand
if you'll ever
hold my hand

When the leaves are fallin' down
you are callin' me back
and your face under the mask
show nothing but a shame
how you've been all alone while you needed me there

and the worst is all upon me
and it feels really bad
and if you will ever
if you'll ever
if you'll ever
hold my hand

when the leaves are growing up
and you don't wanna me back
and your face so shiny fresh
showin' only disrespect
how you've been all alone while you needed me there
the worst is all upon me

who can give me the reason why
who tell me if i should go or stay
who can give me the reason why
who tell me if i should go or stay

i travel all around the world for no reason
the question is why am i gettin' a fever
so when i ask myself about all the sickness
my mind is forgettin' the witness
the witness as simple as for being just me
so i can feel everyone around me
and i can be i can see i can feel
Orell
Orell
give me the reason why
