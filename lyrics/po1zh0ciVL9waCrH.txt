Something I never knew
In silence I'd hear you
And a boat lies waiting
Still your clouds all flaming
That old time easy feeling

What I lost was an ocean
Now I'm drifting through without you
In this sad barcarolle

What I lost was an ocean
And I'm rolling right behind you
In this sad barcarolle

It rocks you like a cradle
It rocks you to the core
You'll sleep like a baby
As it knocks at Death's door
