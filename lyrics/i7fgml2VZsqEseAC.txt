Everytime you walk into the room
Got me feeling crazy
Shock my heart boom boom
Any other boy would stare

But me, I look away
'Cause you making me scared
Tryin' not to breathe 1, 2, 3
Tryin' not to freak when you look at me
Gotta make a move but I freeze

You don't have a clue what you do to me

Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
You make me run and hide, hide, hide
Feel like I get lost in time
Whenever you near me

Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
I'm fightin' butterfli-fli-flies
Yeah, you make me lose my mind
Whenever you near me
Girl, you make me shy
Oh

Rejection is a word that I don't wanna know
But a girl like you could kill a boy real slow

A million words stuck up in my head
Waiting to be said but my tongue is stumbling
Tryin' not to breathe 1, 2, 3
Tryin' not to freak when you look at me

Try to make a move but I freeze
You don't have a clue what you do to me
Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
You make me run and hide, hide, hide
Feel like I get lost in time
Whenever you near me
Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
I'm fightin' butterfli-fli-flies
Yeah, you make me lose my mind
Whenever you near me

Girl, you take me high
I feel like I can fly
But I fall out of the sky
When I look into your eyes
Oh oh
Oh girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
You make me run and hide, hide, hide
Feel like I get lost in time
Whenever you near me
Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
I'm fightin' butterfli-fli-flies
Yeah, you make me lose my mind
Whenever you near me
Girl, you make me shy
Yeah-yeah yeah oh
Girl, you make me shy
Can't even talk to you
Girl, you make me shy
