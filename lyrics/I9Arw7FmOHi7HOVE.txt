The faces aghast
Consumed with hollow judgment
Those vacant eyes stare through me
With scarred hands to bind
They look back in fear

Fall into the flames of our origin
To lie still and wait

The baseless reverence you adjure
Is condemned by truth

Your divine, cast down from the skies
Cold and wretched
It runs through our veins
This is absolute
This is inherent

The spiritual will sever ties with man
And now alone we exist

From within us
Our worth ascends

Subvert the fallacy
A dying breed on their knees
The scorn of the earth
Obsolete

Subvert the fallacy
A dying breed on their knees
And now alone we exist

The scorn of the earth - the puritan
These days are no anomaly
Your blood will spill like any other

Within the mercy of this revelation
We are forever imprisoned
