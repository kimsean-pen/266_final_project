Uh, yeah, whoa, uh huh
Skrr, brr, all those other rap noises the rappers do

Baby you know that I'm addicted to you
I know that you love me, but I haven't been true
Forever means nothing if I can't be with you
Whenever I see you, see you
Whenever I see you it drives me

Crazy
Oh you're so
Wavy
Lemme have your
Babies
Oh you're so
Wavy

I just memed off that Britney Spears song from the '90s
I know that I haven't been here lately
'Cause I've been doing some other stuff
I've been in bed and not living enough

Stood inside
Forgot how to cry
Clock keeps on ticking I'm wasting my time
Seeking attention
Addicted to my self realization been living a lie

Baby you know that I'm addicted to you
I know that you love me, but I haven't been true
Forever means nothing if I can't be with you
Whenever I see you, see you
Whenever I see you it drives me

Crazy
Oh you're so
Wavy
Lemme have your
Babies
Oh you're so
Wavy
