Well you're boring me now
First you stay then you go
If I'm kicking you out
Then it's time you should know
Oh baby

I'm so sick and tired of sitting talking to you
Yeah that's right
You never tell me anything that I wanna know 'bout your life

But baby when you touch me on my body
I love every feeling that I used to know
And baby when you touch me on my body
I'm losing my mind every time here I go

But baby when you touch me on my body
I love every feeling that I used to know
And baby when you touch me on my body
I'm losing my mind every time here I go

Baby, yeah that's right
Baby, yeah that's right

I despise that you know
I'm too weak to say no
I can scream, I can shout
But you still got a hold
Oh baby

My friend are mystified about what I see in you
When you got that right
But they don't know why I put up with all that you do
Oh 'cause you love me right
Am I an addict only hanging out for your touch?
Oh oh oh oh
Well I should go, but maybe I could see you just once
Baby one more time, ohh yeah

'Cause baby when you touch me on my body
I lose every feeling that I used to know
And baby when you touch me on my body
I'm losing my mind every time here I go

'Cause baby when you touch me on my body
I lose every feeling that I used to know
And baby when you touch me on my body
I'm losing my mind every time here I go

Oh baby, I could see you just one more time
Baby, yeah that's right
Oh, It's the way that you love me
Baby, yeah that's right
I know, you're never gonna be ready baby?
Baby, yeah that's right
Talk to me baby, oh, you know I, You know what I want

Come on just touch me on my body
I lose every feeling that I used to know
And baby when you touch me on my body
I'm losing my mind every time here I go

'Cause baby when you touch me on my body
I lose every feeling that I used to know
And baby when you touch me on my body
I'm losing my mind every time here I go

Baby, yeah that's right
Baby, yeah that's right
