When I first came to town
They call me the roving jewel
Now they've change their tune
They call me Katie Cruel

Through the woods I go
And through the boggy mire
Straight way down the road
'Til I come to my heart's desire

If I was where I would be
Then I would be where I am not
Here I am where I must be
Where I would, I can not

When I first came to town
They brought me drinks plenty
Now they've changed their tune
They bring me the bottles empty

If I was where I would be
Then I would be where I am not
Here I am where I must be
Where I would, I can not
