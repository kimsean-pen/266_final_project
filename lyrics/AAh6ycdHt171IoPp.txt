As I sit here alone in the tavern
I can hear her voice soft and low
Then someone dropped a coin in the jukebox
And played an old familiar song

The tears came to my eyes
As I suddenly realized
It was a song that reminded me of her

And as I sit and cry
Someone came to my side
And asked me if I'd lost my best friend.
I said "No".

It's just that song. No, it's just that song.
It's just... I ain't heard it for so long.

It brings back old memories.
Once you leave me alone please?
No, no, it's just that song.
