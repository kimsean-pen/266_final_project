Cellotape an end to
Cellotape an end to
Cellotape an end to
Cellotape an end to
Sitting pretty, uptightly
the knots, keep you at my side, upstairs in corners
eyes blink for the call
up and out, my beacon, will choke, if yours is taken
I'd have four more lines
Four more lines
Aha.
Cellotape an end to
Cellotape an end to
Cellotape an end to
Cellotape an end...
Harder thought, mosquito
Right down
my fickle hands, machine surprises

meant for me
up and out, my beacon, will choke, if yours is taken
I'd have four more lines
Four more lines

It was broken way

Turning on the pages first
Cellotape an end to
Stormy letters hide me, Over
Cellotape an end to
Stormy letters hide me, Over
Silent sorrows, breaks it
Swirls with every tear drop
Pulls my fighting dear across
Cellotape an end to... this

Feels years, leaves knots, bleeds burst, keeps apart
Feels years, leaves knots, bleeds burst, keeps, an honest fool
Feels years, leaves knots, Keeps apart
Feels years, leaves knots, Keeps apart
Cellotape an end to
a story that is ending

Cellotape an end to
a story that is ending
