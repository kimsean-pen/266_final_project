I see your shadow on the street now
I hear you push through the rusty gate
Click of your heels on the concrete
Waiting for a knock, coming way too late
It seems an age since I've seen ya
Count down as the weeks trickle into days

So you come in and put your bags down
I know there's something in the air
How can I do this to you right now?
You're over there when I need you here...

My happiness
Slowly creeping back now you're at home
If it ever starts sinking in
It must be when you pack up and go

It seems an age since I've seen ya
Count down as the weeks trickle into days
I hope that time hasn't changed ya
All I really want is for you to stay

So you come in and put your bags down
I notice something in the air
How can I do this to you right now?
You're over there when I need you here...

My happiness
Slowly creeping back now you're at home
If it ever starts sinking in
Must be when you pack up and go

I know, I know, I know, what is inside
I know, I know, I know, what is inside
I know, I know, I know, what is inside
I know, I know, I know, what is inside

You're over there when I need you here...

My happiness
Slowly creeping back now you're at home
If it ever starts sinking in
Must be when you pack up and go

My happiness
Slowly creeping back now you're at home
If it ever starts sinking in
Must be when you pack up and go
