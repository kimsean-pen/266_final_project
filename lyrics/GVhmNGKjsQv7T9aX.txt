You and I
Ah, the calm below that poisoned the river wild
You and I
Tears that dry on a rude awakened child

Where you look down
I've walked before
Burning holes
With eyes of liquid brown

If we had only known in a way
We wouldn't reach this ground
You were my only home
Silver eyes, I want to see you shine

And we will feel the weight
Fall away from us in time
Searching our past for the true
You and I, you and I, you and I, all for you

Where you think you'll fall
I adore you
Where you shut your soul
I will open for you

If we had only known in a way
We'd never reach this ground
I'll know
Silver eyes, I can see us shine

I said we will feel the weight
Fall away from us in time
Searching our past for a true
You and I, you and I, you and I, all for you
