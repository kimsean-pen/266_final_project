Where we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
so take it easy on me
I'm afraid you're never satisfied
Here we go again
We are sick like animals, we play pretend
you're just a cannibal and I'm afraid I won't get out alive
No I won't sleep tonight
Oh Oh, I want some more
Oh Oh, what are you waiting for?
take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh Oh, I want some more
Oh Oh, what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
Here we go again
I feel the chemicals kicking in
It's getting heavy and I-
Wanna run and Hide!
I wanna run and hide.
I do it every time
you're killing me now!
And I won't be denied by you
the Animal inside of you
Oh oh, I want some more
Oh oh, what are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight.
Oh oh, I want some more
Oh oh. What are you waiting for? What are you waiting for!
Hush, hush. The world is quiet.
Hush, hush. We both can't fight it.
It's us that made this mess, why can't you understand?
I won't sleep tonight.
Oh, oh, I want some more! Oh, oh, What are you fighting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh, I want some more! Oh, oh, What are you fighting for! What are you fighting for?
