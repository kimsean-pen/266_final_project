Romance
My name is Dita
I'll be your mistress tonight

I'd like to put you in a trance
If I take you from behind
Push myself into your mind when you least expect it
Will you try to reject it
If I'm in charge and I treat you like a child
Will you let yourself go wild

Let my mouth go where it wants to

Give it up do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love
I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love

I'll teach you how to
Uuh

I'd like to put you in a trance
All over
(Erotic erotic)
Put your hands all over my body
(Erotic erotic)
Put your hands all over my body

(Erotic erotic)
Put your hands all over my body
(Erotic erotic)

Once you put your hand in the flame
It can never be the same
There's a certain satisfaction in a little bit of pain

I can see you understand
Tell that you're the same
If you're afraid we'll rise above
I only hurt the ones I love

Give it up do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way

I'll give you love
I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love
I'll teach you how to
Uuh

I'd like to put you in a trance
All over
(Erotic erotic)
Put your hands all over my body
(Erotic erotic)
Put your hands all over my body
(Erotic erotic)
Put your hands all over my body

I don't think you know what pain is
I don't think you've gone that way
I could bring you so much pleasure
I'll come to you when you say
I know you want me
(I'm not going to hurt you)
I'm not going to hurt you
Just close your eyes
