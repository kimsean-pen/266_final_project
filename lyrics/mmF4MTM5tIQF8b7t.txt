permission to behave, you know you're not the same
you wait for days and days, to hear him say your name

i want to be like you, i think you know the truth
i want to be like you, show me what i should do

nothing left for you to use, nothing left for you to use
nothing left for you to use, nothing left.

its such an awful game, the one i play with you
we walk in to the shade, try to escape the pain
they don't believe in me, why should i agree
they don't believe in me, i should cooperate

nothing left for you to use, nothing left for you to use
nothing left for you to use, nothing left.
