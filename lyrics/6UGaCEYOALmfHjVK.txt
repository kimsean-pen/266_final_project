Sentimentalist

For a self-professed lover, a romanticist at heart
I wasted less to no time at all
Tying the knot, dying to not rot
But I'm no sentimentalist

Was a self-confessed tyro, so rational, so far
Such a dumb way to get what you want
Loved you a lot, loved you a whole lot
But I'm no sentimentalist

Don't I know you, my love?
Don't I know you, my love?
You can ask me again, but you may never know
I'll be damned if I fight
I'll be damned if I don't
In the end, would it count?
Don't you know me, my love?
Don't you know me, my love?
I may ask you again, but you may never know
I'll be damned if I fight
I'll be damned if I don't

For a final farewell before everything falls down
You wasted less to no time at all
On a table for eight you set for a trio
You were no sentimentalist

Sought a mock independence, irrational and harsh
Such a sad way to get what you want
Love be the hurt and the consoler
But I'm no sentimentalist

Don't I know you, my love?
Don't I know you, my love?
You can ask me again, how the hell should I know?
I'll be damned if I fight
I'll be damned if I don't
In the end, would it count?
Don't you know me, my love?
Don't you know me, my love?
I may ask you again, but you may never know
I'll be damned if I fight
I'll be damned if I don't
