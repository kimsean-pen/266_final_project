White room, toss ceiling in a bright tune
Heads down looking around you
Not much to see but rose and rose and rose
So welcome to the distraction of the destruction
Your whole world falls apart and I say you don't need it
And you tell me you need it
But I say you don't need it
Sit back down and wait for me to say
Welcome to the distraction of the destruction
Your whole world falls apart and I say you don't need it
And you tell me you need it
But I say you don't need it
So sit back

She's a runaway
She's a runaway
She's a runaway, a deserter
And the first of her kind
She's a runaway with the winds
And the dirt left behind

White walls, sit down and keep your legs crossed
So long you feel your knees pop
Look back at all the rose and rose and rose
So welcome to the distraction of the destruction
Your whole world falls apart and I say you don't need it
And you tell me you need it
But I say you don't need it
Sit back down and wait for me to say
Welcome to the distraction of the destruction
Your whole world falls apart and I say you don't need it
And you tell me you need it
But I say you don't need it
So sit back

She's a runaway
She's a runaway
She's a runaway, a deserter
And the first of her kind
She's a runaway with the winds
And the dirt left behind
