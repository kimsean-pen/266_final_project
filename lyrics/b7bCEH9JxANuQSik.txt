You hear that hovering
What's a planet to a moon
Never been there

Insightful but commanded
Mavericks live a life of danger
On a horizon

Pacifist for honor
Never been there, didn't know
Your moment is later
Massacres never seem to find or correct their error

A horizon
I'm in a fighting vehicle
Plague vs. rebel and we're waiting

A way home is back there
Is there something out there
Is there some place
Is there somewhere

We've been told, past Neptune
The insight in your days ahead
That there's something up there
Something out there, up there, somewhere

A horizon
I'm in a fighting vehicle
Plague vs. rebel and we're waiting

Staring at the sky for years
Seem to hold a place unknown to all
Insightful but commanded
Too bold to act alone

They don't seem to know
That in the whites of their eyes you'll see
Reasons unknown

Which legion to fight for
At the height of revolt
With what we know
And so it goes

A horizon
I'm in a fighting vehicle
At the height of revolt

Staring at the sky for years
Seem to hold a place unknown to all
Insightful but commanded
Too bold to act alone

They don't seem to know
That in the whites of their eyes you'll see
Reasons unknown

Which legion to fight for
At the height of revolt
What progression is unjust with what we know

We think we saw you
A cult revival
What goes Into it
An image of my own
