In the morning I'll wake up with you
There's not anything I would rather do

B-Sect
You are more than you'll ever know
And your love teaches me to grow
You are more than my everything
And your love gives me wings

Chorus
Like a butterfly
(And I'll dance in the sunlight)
Like a butterfly
(From the day into the night)

Your touch is the one thing I know is true
My mind is completely devoted to you

You are more than you'll ever know
And your love teaches me to grow
You are more than my everything
And your love gives me wings

Chorus x2
Like a butterfly
(And I'll dance in the sunlight)
Like a butterfly
(From the day into the night)

Like a butterfly
(And I'll dance in the sunlight)
Like a butterfly
(From the day into the night)

Bridge
And it might not last more than a day
But I'll take my chances anyway
'Cause my heart is saying it's for real
No one else has made me feel (this way)

Like a butterfly

Chorus
Like a butterfly
(And I'll dance in the sunlight)
Like a butterfly
(From the day into the night)

Bridge x2
And it might not last more than a day
But I'll take my chances anyway
'Cause my heart is saying it's for real
No one else has made me feel (this way)

And it might not last more than a day
But I'll take my chances anyway
'Cause my heart is saying it's for real
No one else has made me feel (this way)
