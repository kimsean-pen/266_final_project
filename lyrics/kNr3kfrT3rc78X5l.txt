When night falls
Silence
It's so silence down there
I can feel your hunger

You who dwelth down in the unknown realms
Hear my hollow voice as I call upon thy name
Through the black shadows of Death
O' mighty Dead Ones
Wake up from your funeral rest
The earth can no longer grant your silence

When night falls
Mighty storms of damnation
As I summon my nocturnal power
The hordes of Death will rise again

You who dwelth down in the unknown realms
Hear my hollow voice as I call upon thy name
Through the black shadows of Death
O' mighty Dead Ones
Wake up from your funeral rest
The earth can no longer grant your silence

In the name of the almighty emperor
I summon you
And you can now deny me
For I am one of you as much
As Death itself
