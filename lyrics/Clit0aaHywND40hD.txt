It was the fearful night of December 8th
He was returning home from the studio late
He had perceptively known that it wouldn't be nice
Because in 1980, he paid the pri-i-ice

John Lennon died
John Lennon died
John Lennon di-i-i-i-i-ied
John Lennon died
John Lennon died
John Lennon di-i-i-i-i-ied

With a Smith and Wesson, 38
John Lennon's life was no longer a debate
He should have stayed at home, he should have never cared
And the man who took his life declared, he said
"I just shot John Lennon"
He said, "I just shot John Lenno-on"

What a sad and sorry and sickening sight
What a sad and sorry and sickening night
What a sad and sorry and sickening sight
What a sad and sorry and sickening night
Ah hu-a-a hu-a-a hu-a-a hu-a-a-a, ha-u...
Ah hu-a-a hu-a-a hu-a-a hu-a-a-a

"I just shot John Lennon"
He said, "I just shot John Lenno-on"
What a sad and sorry and sickening sight
What a sad and sorry and sickening night
What a sad and sorry and sickening sight
What a sad and sorry and sickening night
Ah hu-a-a hu-a-a hu-a-a hu-a-a-a, ha-u
Ah hu-a-a hu-a-a hu-a-a hu-a-a-a
