Oh-oh, history
Oh-oh, history

Today is just a page
Everything, everything we say is gonna leave a trace
There's ours, just align
Everything, everything we do leaves a trail behind

'Cause time's forever on our side
Who wins? Who loses?
It's a version we decide
We win when the truth comes to life

I won't fade or disappear
We're knocked down, we were here
You and I are writing our history
You and I are writing our history
Our own history
(Our own history)

This pain's only pain
Nothing more, nothing less, we won't let it leave a stain
This feels only doubt
Nothing more, nothing less, not real, we can write it out

'Cause time's forever on our side
Who wins? Who loses?
It's a version we decide
We win when the truth comes to life

I won't fade or disappear
We're knocked down, we were here
You and I are writing our history
You and I are writing our history
Our own history

I won't fade or disappear
We're knocked down, we were here
You and I are writing our history
You and I are writing our history
Our own history
(Our own history)
(Our own history)

Somebody remember
Someone will remember we're here
Somebody remember
Someone will remember we're here
Somebody remember
Someone will remember we're here
Somebody remember
Someone will remember we're here
Somebody remember
Someone will remember we're here
Somebody remember
Someone will remember we're here

I won't fade or disappear
We're knocked down, we were here
You and I are writing our history
You and I are writing our history
Our own history

I won't fade or disappear
We're knocked down, we were here
You and I are writing our history
You and I are writing our history
