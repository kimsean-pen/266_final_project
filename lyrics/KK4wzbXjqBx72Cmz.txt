Some poor sucker
At the bottom of the lake
Took the wrong way up
When the ground began to break
It's a long way back
That's the price we've got to pay

Should've this, should've that
Should've made a list to thank
Should have kept a better track
Put some money in the bank
If your mind's made up
Then there's nothing left to say

All you've given, all you took
All you promised, all your hopes
After all you've done
Fling your body to the walls
It's a lie, it's the truth
Only one thing you can do

Here I am, everything, one thing
Nothing else to take
If your eyes dried up
What the hell you gonna say
Gonna give it to you fast
Gonna give it to you straight
Hang on, it can wait
Gonna put you in your place
Gonna leave you in the dark
At the bottom of the lake
It's a long way back
That's the price you gotta pay

All you've given, all you took
All you promised, all your hopes
After all you've done
Fling your body to the walls
It's a lie, it's the truth
Only one thing you can do
