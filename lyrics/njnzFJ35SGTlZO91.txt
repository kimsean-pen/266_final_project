Uptown, downtown
Haven't seen your face around
Paper said you shot a man
Trigger happy punk down in Chinatown

You're five years dead
Five years dead

Sexy Sue from Hong Kong
Asked around right and wrong
Outta town, change your name
Or ya get five years with a ball and chain

You're five years dead
Five years dead
Five years dead
Five years dead

Five years dead
Five years dead
Five years dead
Five years dead

Your life's on a steady tilt
I stand around and watch you wilt
Lose or win, never mattered, mattered to you

They always said you'd fall apart
I took the bet but I missed the mark
The kid was bad, bad from the start

Left, right or up and down
The same old run around
Neighborhood professional
Your ass is runnin' into the ground

You're five years dead
Five years dead
Five years dead
Five years dead

Uptown, downtown
Haven't seen your face around
Paper said you shot a man
Trigger happy punk down in China town
You're five years dead
Five years dead
Five years dead
Five years dead
Five years dead
Five years dead
Five years dead
Five years dead
Five years dead
