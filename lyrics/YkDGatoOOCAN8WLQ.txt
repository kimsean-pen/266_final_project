My body feels like an inferno
Like I'm in a race and I'm jumping a hurdle
Come closer, we'll pursue it
If you just let go we can do it (we can do it)
Baby, I'm yours for the taking
Bet you wanna see my body naked
I know that you like the way I shake it (uh huh)
And I hope that you can take it

You're the perfect lover
I'm in love with all the things you do
So seductive when you touch me
I can't get enough of you
You're the best, baby, you got me obsessed (yeah)
And I can't catch my breath (ah)
Baby, I must confess you got me (hot, hot)

When you come around (when you come around me)
Got me so damn high
I can't come down (ooh, yeah)
Every time you touch me there (oh)
You make me feel so hot (hot, hot)

I love it

Everything you do is so seductive
You got the thing that I want, and then some
And I can't even front, so listen
I know what you're missing
Better hurry up 'cause time is ticking
Tick tock, tick tock
Come and get me while I'm hot now

You're the perfect lover
I'm in love with all the things you do
So seductive when you touch me
I can't get enough of you
You're the best baby, you got me obsessed
And I can't catch my breath (oh no)
Baby, I must confess you got me (hot, hot)

When you come around (yeah)
Got me so damn high
I can't come down (ooh you got me too hot)
Every time you touch me there (ow)
You make me feel so hot (ooh)

Pull up to my bumper
Need a jump, not a chump
Fill me up, I'm running low (uh huh)
Let me drive you crazy
All night, 'cause we got so far to go (far to go)
Pull up to my bumper
Need a jump, not a chump
Fill me up, I'm running low (uh huh)
Let me drive you crazy
All night, 'cause we got so far to go (here we go)

You're the perfect lover
I'm in love with all the things you do
So seductive when you touch me
I can't get enough of you
You're the best baby, you got me obsessed
And I can't catch my breath (ah)
Baby, I must confess you got me (hot, hot)

When you come around
Got me so damn high
I can't come down (ooh)
Every time you touch me there
You make me feel so hot
