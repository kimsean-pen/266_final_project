Come on
Let's go
All right
Are you ready?

Thought we were so good together
Guess forever didn't really mean always
I found out the hard way

Now where's my happy ever after
A simple question you won't answer babe
Why you playing with me

You said it's over and that you don't care
So I'm wondering what you're doing here

No, it's not alright for you to try to come around
And pick up where you let me down
What makes you think I wanna get back together

No, it's not alright for you to say you're sorry now
I don't know what you're talking 'bout
Your hoping that I'm liking it
You're so whatever

Finally got you out my system
Now you're wishing things were still the same
Sorry, but it's too late

Had your chance but now it's over
It's like I told you when you walked away
I know you're gonna miss me

I still remember when you made me cry
But this time I'm the one saying goodbye

No, it's not alright for you to try to come around
And pick up where you let me down
What makes you think I wanna get back together

No, it's not alright for you to say you're sorry now
I don't know what you're talking 'bout
Your hoping that I'm liking it
You're so whatever

You have to live and learn when
Someone does you wrong
Brush it off and move on

'Cause tables always turn
And one day you will hurt
And realize that what is gone is gone, baby

It's not alright for you to say you're sorry now
I don't know what you're talking 'bout
Your hoping that I'm liking it
You're so whatever

No, it's not alright for you to try to come around
And pick up where you let me down
What makes you think I wanna get back together

No, it's not alright for you to say you're sorry now
I don't know what you're talking 'bout
Your hoping that I'm liking it
You're so whatever

No, it's not alright for you to try to come around
And pick up where you let me down
What makes you think I wanna get back together

No, it's not alright for you to say you're sorry now
I don't know what you're talking 'bout
Your hoping that I'm liking it
You're so whatever

It's not alright
Oh, no
It's not alright
Oh, no
Oh, no
No
