Fall in love with a twisted lady.
Suicide with a cover girl.
Spent all your time then you got stuck paying the price, whoa whoa.
Uptown, kick it down, into a spin,
Face the wall, take it all, you just can't win.
Can't stand the heartache, So bleeds the red, red rose.
Time heals a broken heart, But that's just the way it goes.
Can't stand, I can't stand the heartache.
You got caught in the line of fire, Bystander innocence.
You held your own 'till it wasn't yours anymore.
Waste away another day into the night,
You're at home by the phone, it don't seem right.
Can't stand the heartache, So bleeds the red, red rose.
Time heals a broken heart,
But that's just the way it goes.
Can't stand, I can't stand the heartache.
You held me like a prisoner.
And I don't know,
Why I stayed here from the start.
Uptown, run me down under your wheels,
I pray, one day, you'll know how it feels.
Can't stand the heartache, So bleeds the red, red rose.
Time heals a broken heart, But that's just the way it goes.
Can't stand, I can't stand the heartache.
Can't stand the heartache,
So bleeds the red, red rose.
Time heals a broken heart,
But that's just the way it goes.
Can't stand, I can't stand the heartache.
Can't stand the heartache,
So bleeds the red, red rose.
Time heals a broken heart,
But that's just the way it goes.
Can't stand, I can't stand the heartache.
