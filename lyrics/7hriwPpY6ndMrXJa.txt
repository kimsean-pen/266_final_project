When the waves came to touch
My body melt to butter cause time ain't enough
You said that nothing
Could loosen your clutch
Oh ain't that something
Now I'm waiting up
Irreverent as an ocean
Hailing on the horizon
I'm hanging on to your island
Cause I'm lost, don't give up on me now
Now that we're attached
Nobody knows the future we have
Nobody knows the future
I'm a wave in the crush
My body melt forever like ice
To you touch
Too late to question
Don't play like you're tough
It's breaking your rhythm
Now I'm waiting up
Irreverent as an ocean
Hailing on the horizon
I'm hanging on to your island
Cause I'm lost, don't give up on me now
Now that we're attached
Nobody knows the future we have
I wanna boogie
I wanna get down right now
Suffer in the music
Later we can figure it out
Oh, we're going through it
There's no way to tell it to stop
We're overboard and shore cannot be found
Irreverent as an ocean
Hailing on the horizon
I'm hanging on to your island
Cause I'm lost, don't give up on me now
Don't give up on me now
Now that we're attached
Nobody knows the future we have
Nobody knows the future
