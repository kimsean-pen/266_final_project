I need you, you you you
I need you, you you you
I need you, you you you
Yes I need you, you you you

I got lost in your eyes from the first look
It's a universe full of explosions
Feel excited, we're rising, the earth shook
It's alright now, alright now, babe

Just hit me with your love, can't get enough
Wanna be right here in your arms
For so long I've been looking for you
Now my heart is pounding like
Pappapara

Gon' ride this feeling
Cuz you excite me
I'm not lying
My heart says po-po-pow
(Pow pow!)

Just ride this feeling
I've got inside of me
I'm not lying
My heart says po-po-pow
(Pow pow powow!)

I need you, you you you (Powoppowow!)
I need you, you you you (Pow pow powow!)
I need you, you you you (Powoppowow!)
Yes I need you, you you you

Lasting love is the eternity key
Feel the fire burn deeper and deeper
Live this moment like this is the last time with me
It's alright now, alright now, baby

Just hit me with your love, can't get enough
Wanna be right here in your arms
For so long I've been looking for you
Now my heart is pounding like
Pappapara

Gon' ride this feeling
Cuz you excite me
I'm not lying
My heart says po-po-pow
(Pow pow!)

Just ride this feeling
I've got inside of me

My heart says po-po-pow

All night long, love me and kiss me
Feel me kill me hit me with your love

And lick my lip umm
