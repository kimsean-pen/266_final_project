You living the life in the ghetto paradise
You living that life in the ghetto paradise

Mi nuh know how mi survive the hardship weh in ya
Life never sweet like ah chocolate vanilla
Train line mi born mi nuh born inna villa
Lickle monkey watch how you ah talk to Gorilla
Cah, the government buy arms give the killer
Two party ah flex like a party dem inna
Accepting presents from foreign government
Weh still ah fool dem and a school dem and a khaki dem in
Good god of Moses and Rodney the Killer
Poor people fed up and we can't sim simmer
Can hardly survive as a blasted singer
Much less a baller who is a rahtid winger
Have a right foot like a David Villa
Him mother still ah sell inna market
Jamrock is a precious stone still it's far from a diamond
Take it from I man

Even though Jamaica nice
You gotta live to save your life
After the sunset comes the darkness of the night
Better open up your eyes
You've gotta read between the lines
Living in the ghetto paradise

Jamaica spiritually irie
Pretty and it nice
Still a ghetto paradise and mi nah apologise
It Slippery and it slidey
Di government ah lie
Dem trick we and dem buy we
Di chicken and di fries
Spend a lickle of your time
You giggle and you smile
But even if you try
You couldn't live some ah we life
Riverton ah bun, di lickle pickney dem a cry
Di chubby bottle dem ah pile up on the river side
And den you talk how Jamaica sweet
Wah sweet you will rotten your teeth
And in the streets it nuh nice and easy
Shot a beat, ghetto youths can't sleep
And then they talk how Jamaica nice
You say you living in a paradise
Poverty whistle like a Christmas breeze, yeah
You better take my foolish advice

Even though Jamaica nice
You gotta live to save your life
After the sunset comes the darkness of the night
You better open up your eyes
And read between the lines
When you're living in the ghetto paradise

Survival
Only the fittest
Shall make it out of this jungle alive
Survival
Jah is my witness
The darkest hours of the night is just before daylight

And even though Jamaica nice
You gotta live to save your life
After the sunset comes the darkness of the night
You better open up your eyes
Gotta read between the lines
When you're living in the ghetto paradise

Living in the ghetto, ghetto paradise
Living in the ghetto, ghetto paradise
Living in the ghetto, ghetto paradise
Living in the ghetto, ghetto paradise
When you livin' in the...
Good
