Stutter your moves, how you wanna play
It's all so easy when you're the one who loves to pay
Do I remember what I was taught?
Am I gonna catch you?
Is it bright enough to see all we are?

I'll bring you another rush
I'll bring you another rush
I'll bring you another rush

Oh, who we are and what we do?
Oh, makes me want it, makes me move
Oh, could I be a warrior?
Oh, do you feel it, does it hurt?

I'm going to the border
My body will be stronger
My heart, it will start to shine
And I will be alright
I'm going to the border
My body will be stronger
My heart, it will start to shine
And I will be alright

Shuffle your heart, tell me who's to blame?
Are you feeling guilty?
Does every corner fill with shame?
Do you require me?
To let you know you made it through
That it's getting lighter
You won't get lost, you'll never lose

Oh, who we are and what we do?
Oh, makes me want it, makes me move
Oh, could I be a warrior?
Oh, do you feel it, does it hurt?

I'm going to the border
My body will be stronger
My heart, it will start to shine
And I will be alright
I'm going to the border
My body will be stronger
My heart, it will start to shine
And I will be alright

I'm going to the border
My body will be stronger
My heart, it will start to shine
And I will be alright
I'm going to the border
My body will be stronger
My heart, it will start to shine
And I will be alright

I'm going to the border
My body will be stronger
My heart, it will start to shine
And I will be alright
