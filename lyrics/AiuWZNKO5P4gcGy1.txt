Hello good morning, how ya doing?
Waking up, shaking yesterday's blues, yeah
Turn the TV off, it's bad news man
Feeling fresh like a Ziploc new man
OJ with a champagne tune up
Mimosa holy ghost running through ya
Hell yeah is the new hallelujah
Popping like the top off a bottle and I ain't stopping yet

Baby, it's a brand new day
Ain't no clouds hanging over me
Something doesn't feel the same
The rest of my life gonna start today
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
The rest of my life gonna start today

Crawling out the ocean, this is evolution, can I
Grow into another animal, the next level
I'm sprouting wings and I just wanna sing
In the future, now the past can't harm me
Forget about yesterday, Paul McCartney
I'm feeling like a Beatle on stage
And the whole wide world's gonna know my name

Baby, it's a brand new day
Ain't no clouds hanging over me
Something doesn't feel the same
The rest of my life gonna start today
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
The rest of my life gonna start today

Ladies and gentlemen
This part right here is very simple
It goes like this
I've been up, I've been down
But I got the feeling right now
I've been up, I've been down
But I got the feeling right now
I've been up, I've been down
Do you got the feeling right now?

Baby, it's a brand new day
Ain't no clouds hanging over me
Something doesn't feel the same
The rest of my life gonna start today
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
The rest of my life gonna start today
Good morning
Good morning
The rest of my life gonna start today
