Oh, rock me

Oh, knock me
Oh, rock me
Oh, knock me
Oh, rock me

Oh, knock me
Oh, rock me
Oh, knock me
Oh, rock me

Knock me
Knock me
Knock me
Knock me

Is he looking at me?
'Cause I'm looking at him
Is he looking at me?

I was in love the moment
That I saw you
I followed you through the crowd
And I almost lost you

I was dying to tell you
But scared of your reaction
But I can't hold back
Because I'm rushed with this thing called passion

You've got me knocked out turn me inside out
It's you that makes my heart beat
Hey, you've got me knocked out, baby there's no doubt
You swept me off of my feet

I walked your way hoping that
Maybe you noticed
(Hi, hello there)
I don't want to move to fast
I don't want to blow it

Never did I think
Love could be so amazing
But the things that you're making me do
It's driving me crazy

You've got me knocked out turn me inside out
It's you that makes my heart beat
You've got me knocked out, baby there's no doubt
You swept me off of my feet

I want us to get closer, boy I wanna be
Startin' somethin' with you, baby
My heart is steady knockin' boy you've got my body rockin'
Caught blow-by-blow, love T.K.O.

Knock me
Rock me
Knock me
Rock me

Knock me
Knock me
Knock me

Knocked out turn me inside out
It's you that makes my heart beat
You've got me knocked out, baby there's no doubt
You swept me off of my feet

I want us to get closer, boy I wanna be
Startin' somethin' with you
My heart is steady knockin' boy you've got my body rockin'
Caught blow-by-blow, love T.K.O.

Baby
Rock me

Is he looking at me?
'Cause I'm looking at him
Is he looking at me?

You've got me knocked out turn me inside out
It's you that makes my heart beat
You've got me knocked out, baby there's no doubt
You swept me off of my feet

You've got me knocked out
You've got me knocked out

You've got me knocked out turn me inside out
It's you that makes my heart beat
You've got me knocked out, baby there's no doubt
You swept me off of my feet

You've got me knocked out, baby there's no doubt
You swept me off of my feet
You've got me knocked out turn me inside out
You swept me off of my feet
