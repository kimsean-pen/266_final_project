Are you dangerous
With your measure of proof?
Thoughts are slivers of gold
Abscond with the truth

How does it feel
To be your own deceiver?
Signals raised
Then lost to the aether

But rest assured
The dead are true believers
Rest assured
We are all believers

Are you dangerous?
Found your way to my bed
Spend fewer nights with the living
Then I do with the dead

How am I supposed to run?
Now, am I supposed to run?

I watch you fall
Hollow and depleted
A city razed
Oh, to bury you beneath it

The best endure
With the dead, our true believers
Rest assured
We are all believers

Are you dangerous?
Carved right into my head
Quick lobotomy
Then left me for dead

How am I supposed to sing?
Don't know the melodies
But all the void behind my teeth
