I know it's hard for you
To understand what I'm goin' through
But now I sit here to remind myself
You're always dressed to kill
And you feel like you owe it to the world
But you owe it to yourself

And you're, you're not here
And I can't stop pretending
That you're forever mine

And I
I can't dream anymore since you left
I miss you singing me to sleep
(I can't wake anymore in your arms)

(I miss you singing me to sleep)
Cheer up my friends all say
You're better alone anyway
But you're always on tour
And you're never home
I'm always dressed to kill
And I feel like I owe it to the world

But I owe it to myself
And you're, you're not here
And I can't stop pretending

That you're forever mine
And I
I can't dream anymore since you left
I miss you singing me to sleep

(I can't wake anymore in your arms)
(I miss you singing me to sleep)
Cheer up my friends all say
And I can't stop pretending
That you're forever mine

You're better alone anyway
And you're not here, not here
I can't dream anymore since you left
I miss you singing me to sleep
(I can't wake anymore in your arms)
(I miss you singing me to sleep)
Cheer up my friends all say
