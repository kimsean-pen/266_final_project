I'm the wolf among the sheep.
For you I hound, I come bearing teeth.
I'm the wolf among the sheep.
There will be no escaping from me.

I hunt to kill you all.
No more hiding in the dark.
There's nowhere safe to go.
Chewing to the heart.
Tearing your throat apart.
Nothing will save you now.

Killing season is here.
I smell your blood.
I taste your fear.

I'm the wolf among the sheep.
For you I hound, I come bearing teeth.
I'm the wolf among the sheep.
There will be no escaping from me.
