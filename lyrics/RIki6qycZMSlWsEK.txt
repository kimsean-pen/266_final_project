Why can't you understand me?
I've done all I can for you
I tried to keep it friendly
But you were playing games with me
I thought that you were sincere
And everything was real with you
So I have only one question
I need to know...

Why oh why, why oh why
Why oh why, why oh why
Why oh why, why oh why
Why oh why, why oh why

How could you do it?
Why why why why why

It's time for me to move on
The weather has changed
And I refuse to believe
That somehow you don't see
All the love I've given you
For all the times we shared
I have only one question

I need to know why oh why
How could you do this to me?
Why you treat me so mean?
Oh why, oh why?
Why did you do it?
I need to know why
Why, oh why?
