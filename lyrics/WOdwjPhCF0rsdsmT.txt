We might be in for a late night
Stuck in a lava flow of brake lights
I can hear a rattling bass drum
Driving back to where it came from

Sit back, oh

I shop, therefore, I am the cause
Protect me from what I was

Getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it
Getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it
Getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it
Getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it
Timing is everything, timing is everything
Timing is everything, timing is everything
Timing is everything, timing is everything

I'm at your feet where critters meet
Who should be asleep and not crossing roads or highways
In the afterlife of super cities, rapidly devouring its outskirts
It's neon octopus arms redecorating late at night

Robot camp for kids who hate sports
Mothers crying at the airport
Finding the dreams you left behind to do
Waving goodbye, your young heart cries for you

Sit back, oh
You're finding it hard
To get very far

But we were born waiting in line
Grabbing the future by the eyes

Getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it
Timing is everything, timing is everything
Getting the hang of it, timing is everything
Getting the hang of it, timing is everything
Timing the hang of it, getting is everything
Getting the timing of everything hanging is
Hanging the getting of, timing the everything

Like batteries we die, like rivers we dry
We fuel and recharge, that's humans and cars
My fun, my sun, be my homework done
Where did you go? You were my ride home

Is that what we want?
Is everything shot?
Is that what you ask for?
'Cause that's what we got

Nothing stands still
Nothing stands still
