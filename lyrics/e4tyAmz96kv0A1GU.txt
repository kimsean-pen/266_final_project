I think that, you know and, but when I go in there I have
My philosophy is there is two basic kinds of
There's, there's different kinds of records
One is there are people who make records
That sound like other people's records
And there's other people who make records
That people want to sound like
And that's the fuckin' record I'm gonna make
You know, like, like, I, I know it may sell less
It may sell less, but it's going to mean more
And that's more important to me, like
The money thing is always the most boring part of everything, um
And I'd much rather
I find much more interesting and engaging to be a part of a community
Where money is not
Money and contracts are not the topics of conversation
That's what happened to music
Now I see music, If you make music, if, in other words
Like if, like if people lose their incentive to make music
Because they're not making money off of it
They're not musicians, they're business people
