Have I been awake too long?
I'm taking this way too far
Have I been awake too long?

Then it hits me somewhere right between the eyes
'Cause I know the cost of time
And I've paid it all my life

Near or far, no matter how close you are
Hopelessly, united in entropy
Could it be, the presence of memory
Is all we are, all we'll ever be?

Have I been awake too long?
I'm taking this way too far
Have I been awake too long?

And then I tell myself it's just so far away
Back to the old routine that fills my every day
So pray the holy ghost will save them from the grave
But I know the cost of time
And I've paid it all my life
