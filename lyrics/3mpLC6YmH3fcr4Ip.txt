Oh little birdy, oh little birdy
I saw the little birdy sing
he sang with glee and everything
he sang for spring and sang for me
and everything was so happy
I don't know why i want to fly
try to sigh, try to fly, made a tie
and then it tried to get me down
i want to buy make me fly
get me high, so i can try
and then i try
the little birdy start to cry so happy
little birdy was so happy
little birdy was so happy
Can i touch your birdy wing?
and fly and hop and everything
can the sun reach down on us
and through the heavens only we would sing
I want the birdy make me laugh
see the birdy make me laugh
take a little birdy bath
i don't know why he got me high
i don't know why, i don't know why
it cannot die, it sang too high
and all the birds on the wing sang so together
[repeat all]
So together, so together
