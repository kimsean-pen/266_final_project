The Roman army is marching again, the empire is growing
An all-destroying war machine that's rolling out on the land
Sure about their victory across the river Rhine
Unsuspecting warriors are running into death

The people of the land they suppress
Were born with the free and wild spirit
Slavery they cannot bear
Rome's legions are charged to death

The whole German tribes are standing together
Hatred is ruling their brains
Marching out to fight for their freedom
Marching out to destroy Rome's pride

United by hatred
There's only freedom or death
United by hatred
Killing all invaders till the ground's getting red

The whole Roman army was killed in one day
None of the soldiers survived
The battlefield looked like a slaughterhouse
Rome now your fall has begun

United by hatred
There's only freedom or death
United by hatred
Killing all invaders till the ground's getting red
