I see you driving around town with the girl I Love
And I'm like
Fuck you!
Ooo oooh ooooh
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
And I'm like
Fuck you! And fuck her too.

I said if I was richer
I'd still be with ya
Ha now ain't that some shit?
(ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a...
Fuck you!

But that don't mean I can get you there

Beg and steal and lie and cheat
Trying to keep ya, trying to please ya
