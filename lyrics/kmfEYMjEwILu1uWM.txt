Let me be your first time
Let me be your last.
Celebrate your highs that lift you when you crash.
The only name you breathe
Let me be, let me be.

Let me be your slow song
Let me be your fast.
The thought rolling off your tongue
Your pocket full of cash.
The dream when you sleep
Let me be, let me be.

A night you won't forget
The words you don't regret
Your one and only
Let me be, let me be.

Your "Make a wish" that comes true
The one you always run to
Your one and only
Let me be, let me be.

Let me be the secret you spill in the dark
That put you back together when you fall apart.
The heart on your sleeve
Let me be, let me be.

Your balance when you walk along the edge
The out from under when you're in over your head.
The reason you believe
Let me be, let me be.

A night you won't forget
The words you don't regret.
Your one and only
Let me be, let me be.

Your "Make a wish" that comes true
The one you always run to.
Your one and only
Let me be, let me be.

I gave you bats, not butterflies.
I know you suffer through the lies
You're still the only one for me
But let me be, let me be.

Let me be your first time
Let me be your last.
Celebrate your highs that lift you when you crash.
The reasons you believe...
A night you won't forget
The words you don't regret.
Your one and only
Let me be, let me be.
Your "Make a wish" that comes true
The one you always run to.
Your one and only
Let me be, let me be.
