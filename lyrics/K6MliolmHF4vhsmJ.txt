It's getting late, your eyes are closed
And mine are wide awake, but still,
I can never go on, I can never go on like just like
I'm begging just to see your eyes again
I can never go on (I can never go on)
Should I even care that you didn't say anything
I tried to do my best, should've given her better things
Like rings... and roses...

Never do reply when I hint the message
I try to smell my best with a bottle of essence
Getting to the point with style and romance
And I could never go on, I could never go on

[Chorus:]
The way she moves away, oh
I wanted her to stay awhile don't go away, oh
The way she moves away, oh
I wanted her to stay awhile don't go away, oh oh

Huh, she's showing signs of motion as she wipes the sleep away
I can get through this, I can get through this ride
You gotta give a little, but it takes a lot to get over you
Cause it makes no sense to be permanent
If you're not feeling it, right? Right, right!

The way she moves away, oh
I wanted her to stay awhile don't go away, oh
The way she moves away, oh
I wanted her to stay awhile don't go away, oh oh

It's a terrible thing, to know what you want
And to know you can't have it at all
I wanted was to let you know how I... it's a terrible thing
It's a terrible, it's a terrible thing, oh
A terrible, a terrible thing, oh yeah!

The way she moves away, oh
I wanted her to stay awhile don't go away, oh
The way she moves away, oh
I wanted her to stay awhile don't go away, oh oh
The way she moves
The way she moves
The way she moves
The way she moves
