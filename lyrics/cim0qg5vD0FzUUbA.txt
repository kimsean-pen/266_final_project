Can you explain to me how
You're so evil? How?
It's too late for me now
There's a hole in the earth
I'm out

There's a hole in the earth
I'm out

Can you explain to me now
If you're still evil? Well
I think you know the truth
There's a hole in the earth
I'm out

I hate all of my friends
They all lack taste sometimes

There's a hole in the earth
I'm out
There's a hole in the earth

Please take a bow
(This is the end)
Somewhere
(This is the end)
Somewhere

There's a hole in the earth
There's a hole in the earth
I hate all of my friends
I'm out
There's a hole in the earth
I will wait
Somewhere
