You had me
You lost me
You're wasted
You cost me
I don't want you here, messin' with my mind

Spittin' in my eyes and I still see
Tried to keep me down, I'm breakin' free
I don't want no part in your next fix
Someone needs to tell you this is it
Hey
Listen, you'll be missin' out
All my love and my kissin'
Make your mistakes on your own time
When you come down, you're just no good to have around
Instead of makin' money you took mine

You had me
You lost me
You're wasted
You cost me
I don't want you here, messin' with my mind

I've realized
In time
That my eyes
Are not blind
I've seen it, before, I'm takin' back my life

You tried to trade on my naivety
But the things you do and say embarrass me
Seem once upon a time I was your fool
But the one I leave behind he is you
Hey
Listen, you'll be missin' out
All my love and my kissin'
Make your mistakes on your own time
When you come down you're just no good to have around
Instead of makin' money you took mine

You had me
You lost me
You're wasted
You cost me
I don't want you here, messin' with my mind

I've realized
In time
That my eyes
Are not blind
I've seen it, before, I'm takin' back my life

Vodka and a packet of cigarettes
That's all it used to be but now
You're sniffin' on snow when you're feelin' low
Suffocatin' dreams that could have
Maybe for a minute I'd be down with that
But it didn't take long for me to see the light
You swore, you had control of it
When I stepped back you slipped on your support
Umm hmm

You had me
You lost me
You're wasted
You cost me
I don't want you here, messin' with my mind, oh

I've realized
In time
That my eyes
Are not blind
I've seen it, before, I'm takin' back my life

Takin' it back, I'm takin' it back
Takin' back my life
Takin' it back, I'm takin' it back
Takin' back my life
Ain't nobody got no business, stressin' all the time
Takin' it back, I'm takin' it back
Takin' back my life
You had me
You lost me
You're wasted
You cost me
I don't want you here, messin' with my mind, ah
I've realized
In time
That my eyes
Are not blind
I've seen it, before, I'm takin' back my life
