Underneath endless oceans
All I see is the edge of your smile
Hurricane, set in motion
Pulls me into its opening eye
Cast upon the shores of fire,
Blood, and water collide
Tears that drown my desire
Wash away in your tide

All rivers lead into a dark and endless sea
Memories bleed into a cold and dreamless sleep

Caught between dreamless slumber
And the demon that lives in your eyes
Lightning moves with your thunder
Burns the moon and the stars in the sky
Cross my heart in your fire
Kept my soul by your side
All the years of desire
Wash away in your tide

All rivers lead into a dark and endless sea
Memories bleed into a cold and dreamless sleep

All rivers lead into a dark and endless sea
Memories bleed into a cold and dreamless sleep
