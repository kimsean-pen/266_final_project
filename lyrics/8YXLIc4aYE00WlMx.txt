No words, no words, no words

When everything's quiet
Nothing on the tip of your tongue
But a beautiful silence
And it lets me know
But even in the madness
When everything just seems to go wrong
Take a beautiful silence
'Cause it lets me know

Ribs are a cage of a wild heart
I can hear your heart beatin' in the bars
Beating in the bars, beatin' in the bars
Ribs are a cage of a wild heart
I can hear your heart beatin' in the bars
Beating in the bars, beatin' in the bars

When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
And the world is trying to beat you down
Beat you down, beat you down
No, no, no words
Keep it quiet
Leave it on the tip of your tongue
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
No, no, no words

When I'm in the darkness
The dawn is having you by my side
'Cause you leave me speechless
And it lets me know
When nobody can hear us
I'll tell you everything with my eyes
'Cause you leave me speechless
And I think you know

When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
And the world is trying to beat you down
Beat you down, beat you down
No, no, no words
Keep it quiet
Leave it on the tip of your tongue
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
No, no, no words

No words, no words, no words
We need
No words, no words, no words
Hear me
No words, no words, no words
Baby
No words, no words, no words
(No words, no)
No, no, no
(All we need is no words)
No, no

When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
And the world is trying to beat you down
Beat you down, beat you down
No, no, no words
Keep it quiet
Leave it on the tip of your tongue
When everything is up and down
Up and down, up and down
No, no, no words

No words, no words, no words
When it
No words, no words, no words
Hear me
No words, no words, no words
Baby
No words, no words, no words

(No words)
Ribs are a cage of a wild heart
I can hear your heart beatin' in the bars
Beating in the bars, beatin' in the bars
No, no, no words
(No words)
Ribs are a cage of a wild heart
I can hear your heart beatin' in the bars
Beating in the bars, beatin' in the bars
No, no, no words

(Baby)
No words, no words, no words
