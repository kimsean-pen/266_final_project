Here I am
Back to the wall
I pick the fight
Against the tide
Free at last, I go my own way
I will resist them
'Til the day I die

I am who I am
My time has come!

I am who I am
Take it or leave it
A rebel at heart
No gods, no masters
My time has come

There is no sacred place
No perfect world
Your head is home
Freedom in your heart
Be strong
Take this chance
Make your way
A better future calls

I am who I am
My time has come!

I am who I am
Take it or leave it
A rebel at heart
No gods, no masters
My time has come

No gods, no masters
No gods, no masters

What doesn't kill us makes us stronger
Locked and loaded, ready to strike
Here we stand, loud and proud
United as one
United as one

I am who I am
Take it or leave it
A rebel at heart
No gods, no masters
My time has come
I am who I am
Take it or leave it
A rebel at heart
No gods, no masters
My time has come
