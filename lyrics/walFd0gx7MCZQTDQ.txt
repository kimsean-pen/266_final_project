Hello
I'm the whisper-clap man
Tuggin' on my sleeves
Doin' all that I can do
Can you weather the moment whether the fortune comes before the end?
You should be satisfied as well

Now we're counting all the hours on the second hand for days
Mending ties with broken time in many different ways
If all of us spin 'round 'til every one of us is down

Impressing pressure in dialect forms
Ride the spiral seas
Beyond the storm
Learn and decide
Fall 'til you fly
Take a breath and dive

Let's go
Have you stepped to the edge
Stared into the sea
From the foot of your bed
Have you woke in a dream
To sleep through the meaning and mean everything you said
You will be satisfied as well

Now we're counting all the hours on the second hand for days
Mending ties with broken time in many different ways
If all of us spin 'round 'til every one of us is down

Impressing pressure in dialect forms
Ride the spiral seas
Beyond the storm
Learn and decide
Fall 'til you fly
Take a breath and dive

just below the waterline, I see
Just below the waterline, I lay
Below the surface, I believe
There is a place of love and wonder
Where all we are and dare to be is fearlessly discovered
And wrapped within the motion of the unrelenting struggle
Oh, this sinking feeling seeing everything in double
Oh, what beautiful monsters
Oh, what beautiful monsters
Oh, what beautiful monsters
Oh, what beautiful
You're all beautiful monsters
You're all beautiful monsters
You're all beautiful monsters
You're all beautiful monsters
