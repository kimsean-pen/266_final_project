Has it really been that long?
Did I count the days wrong?
Did we just go 'round and 'round
All the way to step one?

They would ask me all the time
Every time the show's up
"So what you doin' with your life?"
It ain't givin' up

Just growin' up in stages
(Lay down, low down)
Livin' life in phases
Another season changes
And still, my days are shapeless

It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flying straight, with no delay
'Cause time takes from everyone

I'm just laying here
Waiting for a change to come
Take us to the place
Takin' us where we would have gone

They would ask me all the time
Showin' up in ages
"So what you doin' with your life?"
Call it givin' up

I'm just growin' up in stages
(Lay down, low down)
Livin' life in phases
Another season changes
And still, my ways are aimless, I know
We're growin' up in stages
And I'm runnin' out of patience
Growin' up

It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flying straight, with no delay
'Cause time takes from everyone
