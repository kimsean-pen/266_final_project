I break the mirrors into pieces
I break the mirrors into pieces
I just can't escape from the demons
I think I gotta end them

Yeah, I think I gotta end them all, ah-ah-all
(A, B)
I think I gotta end them all, ah-ah-all

Hey, hey, hey, love is stallin'
Hey, everything drama
I don't wanna hear the gossip
Tell me how to live, please quit all the talkin'
Puta t√∫ madre, a si no me hable
I just got your girl in my recents
I don't got the energy to even read it

You can take it or you can leave it
Or you can leave it
I pop white, blue, yellow, all for a reason
6:00 AM, toss and turn

I still can't sleep
Oh, I don't really give a care 'bout what you think
(I pout thing)

I break the mirrors into pieces
I break the mirrors into pieces
I just can't escape from the demons
I think I gotta end them

Yeah I think I gotta end them all, ah-ah-all
(A, B)
I think I gotta end them all, ah-ah-all

Hey, Mary, Eve and the Xanny fam fucked it up for me, uh
Sorry dummy, honeys are the reasons for the money, ah
You're runnin' bunny, bunny bunny can't hide from me
From me, from me, yeah
I was on Melrose rollin' with my guys
Spray paint 070 on the West Side
I was feelin' good, spent a couple hundred on Prada
Want my diamonds to dance better than my saucer

Uh, and I feel like, I don't even love anything anymore
I can't even look in the mirror anymore
I'm breakin' into pieces (I'm breakin' into pieces)
And I feel like I can't even love right now anymore
And now everything I dreamed of
Is escapin' my mind, and now I just want to be old
And I can't really see you (I can't really see you)

I know you dressed up for me tonight but I just can't see you
I know you did your makeup all for me tonight
And you look so good, but I can't even see you
'Cause I can't even see myself
And I can't even see my, in-in myself
So how am I gon' see you?
Yeah, oh
But I, I got some reasons
I don't got four, five, six baby,
I got seven reasons, I got seven reasons
I got seven reasons, I don't got four, five, six
I got seven reasons, I don't got four, five, six
I got seven reasons, I don't got four, five, six
I got seven reasons, I don't got four, five, six

Mary, Eve and the Xanny fam fucked it up for me, uh
Sorry dummy, honeys are the reasons for the money
M-m-m-m-money
