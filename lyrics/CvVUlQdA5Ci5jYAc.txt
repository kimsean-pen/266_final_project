I'm not saying that
I felt like you cared
I'm not saying that
I want to go back
The salty sea behind the eyes
And it's the tears
That come and make me cry
The falling leaf that never tries
To hold on to what
Keeps it alive
I was so green
Nothing could touch me
I'm not saying that
This is good or bad
I'm not saying that
I wanna go
The salty sea behind the eyes
And it's the tears
That come and make me cry
The falling leaf that never tries
To hold on to what
Keeps it alive
The summer dream behind the eye
And it's the sleep that makes me alive
The sudden ease when you arrive
And it's you
That makes me try.
