I'm in love

Are the 3 words I hope to hear next year
Another place another time another
twinkle in eyes caught between awkward glances
In crowded social scenes, another breeding ground for apathy
To tire me into indifference

Now that I'm numb
To places I had run from
Know when you're wrong
It's cause you're fallible, just like everyone

Just stuck between a lampshade and the drunk
Sentenced to an evening as the party entertainment's prop
Oh but it's only you that I am thinking of
Please return to me, cause it's so...

So hard to take that I might break
I'm discovering that there's so much to consider worthwhile
But most of all I've learned to hate that I'm still stuck on you

If time has taught us this much
It's that honesty is the cornerstone of trust
Well to tell the truth I'm tired of watching clocks
Waiting for endings of evenings that never seem to stop. Enough

In short I've come
Back to the places I had run from
You saw it all
Fall to pieces, now it's so...

So hard to take that I might break
I'm discovering that there's so much to consider worthwhile
But most of all I've learned to hate that I'm still stuck on you
