I won't come down unless you're bulletproof
We float off the ground, suspended interlude

It's all the same again, I see a hole in your reflection
We all betray, but still defend our cruel imagination

I never wanna come back down
Don't wanna feel this low again
Don't wanna bring you down
'Cause we can never go back again
And this might feel like it's wrong
We've lost it all
Don't wanna come back down
'Cause now we're hanging on by a thread

I see through the walls and wander away with you
We never had rules to force us to break through

It's all the same again, I see our visions unjustified
We all fall the same, we find ourselves imprisoned inside

I never wanna come back down
Don't wanna feel this low again
Don't wanna bring you down
'Cause we can never go back again
And this might feel like it's wrong
We've lost it all
Don't wanna come back down
'Cause now we're hanging on by a thread

Something's pullin' us up in the air
Now I see the sky beneath us

I never wanna come back down
Don't wanna feel this low again
Don't wanna bring you down
'Cause we can never go back again
And this might feel like it's wrong
We've lost it all
Don't wanna come back down
'Cause now we're hanging on by a thread
