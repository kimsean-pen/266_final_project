Impossible to rise
With shoulder blades of velveteen
Your eyelids closed
Misdiagnosed

They tried to tear it down
The stairs you built to find your way
To reach a light
See through the lies

Don't let it go to waste
Don't you go waste it all
(You) don't have to be forever star-crossed
Oh, please don't let it go
Oh, don't you let it go to waste

Whatever they said
Whatever they misread
I'm illuminated
You're an indigo
What they cut
You're able to build up
There's no doubt in my mind
You're an indigo

Oh, don't hold it in any longer
Day by day stronger and stronger

A shady skyline
Them rays of light died out
Unfolded paper planes can't fly away
Don't let it go to waste
Don't you go waste it all
(You) don't have to be forever star-crossed
Oh, please don't let it go
Oh, don't you let it go to waste

Whatever they said
Whatever they misread
I'm illuminated
You're an indigo
What they cut
You're able to build up
There's no doubt in my mind
You're an indigo

Oh, don't hold it in any longer
Day by day stronger and stronger
