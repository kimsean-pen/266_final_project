- Stay still patient; wilt thou my sister of merciful troth be?
- I shall attempt the halterof thy life make less tighten'd!

-- I shall climb the yew,
-- Will it subdue me or not!

-- Swooning emotions smite my bosom -
-- I have an aptness depriev'd thy eyrie
Oh! - ne'er alas; -- Fro many another a lass -
Lodge here fore'ermore. -- Dodge thither sable of yore!

- A narrow dell hath now for me turn'd into a broad land;
- A land rich with fields of the Simbelmyn.

-- Sonorous to my ears are the words form'd by thy tongue
-- Conquer me! - Waylay me! - Swathe me 'twixt thy arms!
-- Make me sense the wine which is drunk by queens,

Make me sense the wine which is drunk by kings,

-- And let it flow white and full in tast o'er my lips.

And let it flow red and full in taste o'er my lips.

-- A dais'd bridge o'er the ghyll,
-- In which a river bottomless -
-- I would have drownèd,
-- Yet thou drewest me out soaking!

Save thou art not yet all parchèd -
Eavesdroppest ye: A wee drop, -- I can hear it! - I can feel it!
Whence it comes I can only deem, -- Yet I will not tarry idly!
Lest this for me is a gay dream: -- Let it adamant be -
A dream that will sojourn eternally - -- Empty the flagon in me!
In which theatre I will act!
