He's the king of rock and roll
All right, yeah
Right

Hot night, summer in the city
Just about to smoke and burn
Look out, he's evil but he's pretty
And oh he's going to twist and turn

He's got the midnight madness, he's got control
He's the king of rock and roll

Bad blood, everybody knows it
But everybody doesn't care, no
He's got the only way to show it
They want to see it everywhere

He's got to give you fever, he'll scratch your soul
He's the king of rock and roll
The king of rock and roll

Bad boy, always on the cover
Getting the story told
Fast, fast, one way or another
'Cause he'll never, never, never, never, never get old

He makes a special magic and you've got control
You are the king of rock and roll

He's got the midnight madness, he's got a soul
'Cause he's the king of rock and roll
The king of rock and roll

Rock and roll
Rock and roll
Rock and roll

The king of rock and roll, yeah
