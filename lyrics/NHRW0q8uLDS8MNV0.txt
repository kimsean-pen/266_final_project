Flowers in her hair, she don't care
Peach-pink lips, yeah everybody stares
You think you've seen her in a magazine
It's like she walked right out of your dreams

Black Ray Bans, you know she's with the band
Passport stamps, she's cosmopolitan
Yeah, she runs the place like Penny Lane
Yeah, you're lucky if you're on her plane

From Tokyo to Mexico to Rio

That girl's a trip
A one-way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high
She's got that one international smile
Catch her if you can
Yeah, she's so in demand
Takes you miles high, so high
She's got that one international smile

She's got that je ne sais quoi, you know it
So tr√®s chic, yeah she's a classic
Yeah, she's footloose and so fancy free
Yeah, she dances to her own beat

'Cause she's the muse and the artist
Always leaves a trail of stardust
'Cause she's a little bit of Yoko
And she's a little bit of, "Oh no"

From LA, Miami to New York City!

That girl's a trip
A one-way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high
She's got that one international smile
Catch her if you can
Yeah, she's so in demand
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she's got that one international smile

Please fasten your seatbelts and make sure your champagne glasses are empty
We are now approaching the runway
So get ready for take off
That girl's a trip
A one-way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high
She's got that one international smile
Catch her if you can
Yeah, she's so in demand
Takes you miles high, so high
She's got that one international smile
