Oh satellite above
Where are you?
So many things I have to tell you of
Please come back soon
You went through an open door
Or a hole in the floor
You vanished and I can't see you anymore

Dreams never die
When we sleep
Beneath the open sky
And the deep
Shades over head
Of blue and red
Is this the end?
Will you come back again?

I searched beyond the clouds
Are you there?
I walked sadly onward through the crowds
Alone somewhere
I saw beyond the blur
To right where you were
And I beheld the sight so pure

Dreams never die
When we sleep
Beneath the open sky
And the deep
Shades over head
Of blue and red
Is this the end?
Will you come back again?
