The coffin is sealed on your rotten corpse
You lie in darkness, death corrodes your face

You are rotting, maggots in your coffin

Worms in your head - Soon they'll be dead
Nothing to feed on in your empty skull

Hell is where you are, your tortured soul is scarred
For years you'll rot in pain, lonely and decayed

You are rotting, maggots in your coffin
