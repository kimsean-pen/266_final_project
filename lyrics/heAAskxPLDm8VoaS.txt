I'm tired of bleeding for the ones I love
Look to the heavens but there's no one above
One day you need me, the other you hate
We've all got problems, I can fucking relate

I've tried my best to be humble
I've tried so hard to explain
I know that nothing is easy
(Over and over)
I know that all of it's my fault
I bring you nothing but pain
Look at the way that you treat me
That's why I'm insane

Top of the world
Living the dream, wake me up, wake me up when it's over
Top of the world
Living the dream, wake me up, wake me up when it's over

I'm sick of burning for the ones I despise
Have you mistaken me for some other guy?
One day you love me, the other you run
My life's a comedy, well, isn't this fun?

I've tried my best to be humble
I've tried so hard to explain
I know that nothing is easy
(Over and over)
I know that all of it's my fault
I bring you nothing but pain
Look at the way that you treat me
That's why I'm insane

Top of the world
Living the dream, wake me up, wake me up when it's over
Top of the world
Living the dream, wake me up, wake me up when it's over

You know I'm living it up
Never giving a fuck
I heard you're down on your luck
I-I just wanna take it
Living it up
Never giving a fuck
Never giving it up
I-I just wanna break it down

Top of the world
Living the dream, wake me up, wake me up when it's over
Top of the world
Living the dream, wake me up, wake me up when it's over
Top of the world
Living the dream, wake me up, wake me up when it's over
Top of the world
Living the dream, wake me up, wake me up when it's over
