Where the fuck am I
Tell me did I just die?
'Cause I don't understand why
I'm in a room I don't recognise
I died at 5:45
Yeah it says so on a sign
And my mother's crying out her eyes
Or is the radio telling lies

A juvenile sinner, a car-crash winner
Don't let the devil take you out for dinner
Juvenile sinner, a car-crash winner
Don't let the devil take you out for dinner

I just wanna die for the hype, for the hype
Crucified like Jesus Christ
I just wanna die for the hype, for the hype
Crucified like Jesus Christ

I'm digging my own grave for the day
I decorate with pink socks and gold chain
Two fat stacks on my eyes
I'm in a box I don't recognise
Believe what they say
And you'll be flying away
On a cold coup at d-day
Why that chicken sookie on your face

A juvenile sinner, a car-crash winner
Don't let the devil take you out for dinner
Juvenile sinner, a car-crash winner
Don't let the devil take you out for dinner

I just wanna die for the hype, for the hype
Crucified like Jesus Christ
I just wanna die for the hype, for the hype
Crucified like Jesus Christ

Yeah polly
I just wanna suck on your lolly
I just wanna suck on your lolly
I just wanna suck on your lolly, polly

Yeah polly
I just wanna suck on your lolly
I just wanna suck on your lolly
I just wanna suck on your lolly, polly

I just wanna die for the hype, for the hype
Crucified like Jesus Christ
I just wanna die for the hype, for the hype
Crucified like Jesus Christ
I just wanna die for the hype, for the hype
Crucified like Jesus Christ
I just wanna die for the hype, for the hype
Crucified like Jesus Christ
