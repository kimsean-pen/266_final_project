I see a dog star divin' at his magic, snatchin'
Keeps me up awake, go crystal cracking
I can't wait, I can't stay, a candle
Gotta change my mind before it burns out

I'm the cocker on the rock
Wind is whipping through my stupid mop

I see a falling snowgirl walking Broadway
Turns the corner at 14th and I know there's no way
It's alright, it's alight candle
And I know she'll be okay by Sunday

I'm the cocker on the rock
Humming bash starts shining in your electric clock

It's safe to say, "Candle, tonight's the day, candle"
It's alright now, candle, the wind's away, candle
Never thought I'd see a dog star falling

I'm the cocker on the rock
Wind is whipping through my stupid mop
