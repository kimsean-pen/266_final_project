I'm always too late
I see the train leaving
I'm always laughing
When it's not cool to smile

I'm always aiming
But somehow keep missing
So how did u get here
Something is wrong

where did i go right
how did i get you
how come all this blue sky is around me
and you found me
where did i go right
how did i get you
I don't know how I did
but somehow now i do

im always driving
forget where i'm going
should have turned left
but i was singing some song
and i, i am arriving
as everyone's leaving
but there you are waiting
something is wrong

where did i go right
how did i get you
how come all this blue sky is around me
and you found me
where did i go right
how did i get you
i dont know how i did
but somehow now i do

makes no sense to me
no way is it clear
but somehow you're standing here
something gets to me
it's that nothing is wrong

where did i go right
how did i get you
how come all this blue sky is around me
and you found me
where did i go right
how did i get you
i dont know how i did
but somehow now i do2x
