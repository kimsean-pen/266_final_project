[Incomprehensible] sits sky high
Skips to the starlight
Rains tinsel whispers
Breeze blows away

I crawl inside me
My eyes to heaven
Pink cloud sits sky high
Breeze blows away

Silver air everywhere
Doesn't care
But silver winds
Cut my skin everywhere

I crawl inside me
My eyes to heaven
Pink cloud sits sky high
Breeze blows away

Breathe in green velvet
My lips taste warm earth
Pink cloud sits sky high
Breeze blows away

Summer sun so much fun
Colors run
Hot summers kiss
Cloudless bliss burns my tongue

Summer sun so much fun
Colors run
Hot summers kiss
Cloudless bliss burns my tongue

Hot summers kiss
Cloudless bliss burns my tongue
