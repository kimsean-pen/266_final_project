There ain't enough raised right men
I said, there ain't enough raised right men
It takes a raised right man to keep a happy hen
I said, there ain't enough raised right men

Heavens to murkatroid, miners to coal
A good women can make a diamond out of a measly lump of coal
And you need the patience of a glacier
If you can wait that long
Open up his window and admit it when you're wrong

There ain't enough raised right men
Ain't enough raised right men
I said, there ain't enough raised right men
It takes raised right men to keep a happy hen
I said, there ain't enough raised right men

Mackey Debiasi was a complicated man
He quarreled with his woman and she quarreled with her man
And his head was just too thick
So she knocked out a tooth
He's that lonely man on the Turnpike in the toll takers booth

There ain't enough raised right men
Ain't enough raised right men
I said, there just ain't enough raised right men
It takes raised right men to keep a happy hen
I said, ain't enough raised right men

Gunplay Maxwell and Flat Nose George
Ice Pick Ed Newcomb on a slab in the morgue and
Flat Nose looked at Gunplay and they all looked at me
With a good woman's love we could have saved all three

And there ain't enough raised right
And there ain't enough raised right
And there ain't enough raised right
And there ain't enough raised right men

I said, ain't enough raised right men
It takes raised right men to keep a happy hen
I said, ain't enough raised right men
I said, there ain't enough raised right men
I said, there ain't enough raised right men
Where are the raised right men
