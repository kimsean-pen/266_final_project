I'm lost for words and I can't say, the things that crawl my mind.
And on the surface I beg you, read between the lines.

I'm lost for words and I can't say, the things that crawl my mind.
And on the surface I beg you, read between the lines.
I want to find a way, to replace the things I lost.
They left so suddenly, couldn't pick the pieces up.

See the color leave my eyes, but it's just too hard to translate.
Chemicals that don't align, and I'm just too hard to translate.
See an all familiar face, but it's just to hard to translate.
Feel forever out place, and I'm just too hard to translate.

I feel the demons inside me. They're trapped inside my mind.
The greed and envy it haunts me. And it leaves me blind.
I want to find a way, to replace the things I lost.
They left so suddenly, couldn't pick the pieces up.

See the color leave my eyes, but it's just too hard to translate.
Chemicals that don't align, and I'm just too hard to translate.
See an all familiar face, but it's just to hard to translate.
Feel forever out place, and I'm just too hard to translate.

Shadows only show when the light comes, but I see them all the time.
Well if I could describe how it all looks, bite my tongue when I'm going blind.

See the color leave my eyes, but it's just too hard to translate.
Chemicals that don't align, and I'm just too hard to translate.
See an all familiar face, but it's just to hard to translate.
Feel forever out place, and I'm just too hard to translate.

Just too hard to translate, just too hard to translate,
Just too hard to translate, just too hard to translate.
