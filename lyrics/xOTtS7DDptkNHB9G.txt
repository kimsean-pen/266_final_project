How long can we stay
Looking skyward
Waiting for the truth
How mutch do we want
A picket fence and
The summer of your youth

We're slipping in and out of love
The shame of you and me
Is it could have been enough

You can't call the fixer
You can't stop the train
You can't change the picture
If you break the frame
It's already done
It's already done

Why don't we show
Those old emotions
That we can't feel today
And there must be
Something deeper
We can't just throw away

We're slipping in and out of love
The shame of you and me
Is it could have been enough

You can't call the fixer
You can't stop the train
You can't change the picture
If you break the frame
It's already done
It's already done

Life's for making
Love's for breaking
Take your chances where you can

We're slipping in and out of love
The shame of you and me
Is it could have been enough

You can't call the fixer
You can't stop the train
You can't change the picture
If you break the frame
It's already done
It's already done
You can't call the fixer
You can't stop the train
You can't change the picture
If you break the frame
It's already done
It's already done
