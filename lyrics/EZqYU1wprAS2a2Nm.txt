He needs a quiet room
With a lock to keep him in
It's just a quiet room
and he's there
He plays an old guitar
With the coin found by the phone
It was his friend's guitar
That he played
Hmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.
Mmm-mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm-mmm.
He's never been in love
But he knows just what love is
He says, "never mind"
and no one speaks
He thinks he drinks too much
'Cause when he tells his two best friends,
"I think I drink too much"
No one speaks
No one speaks
No one speaks
Hmm-mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.
Mmm-mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm-mmm.
He plays an old guitar
With the coin found by the phone
It was his friend's guitar
And he played
When he plays
No one speaks
No one speaks
When he plays
No one speaks
