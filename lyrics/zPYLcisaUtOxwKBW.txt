It's the perfect time of year
Somewhere far away from here
I feel fine enough, I guess
Considering everything's a mess

There's a restaurant down the street
Where hungry people like to eat
I could walk but I'll just drive
It's colder than it looks outside

It's like a dream, you try to remember but it's gone
Then you try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn
When you try to see the world beyond your front door

Take your time 'coz the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile
When you realize that a guy my size might take a while
Just to try to figure out what all this is for

It's the perfect time of day
To throw all your cares away
Put the sprinkler on the lawn
And run through with my gym shorts on

Take a drink right from the hose
Then change into some drier clothes
Climb the stairs up to my room
Sleep away the afternoon

It's like a dream, you try to remember but it's gone
Then you try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn
When you try to see the world beyond your front door

Take your time 'coz the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile
When you realize that a guy my size might take a while
Just to try to figure out what all this is for

Pinch me, pinch me
'Coz I'm still asleep
Please God, tell me
That I'm still asleep

On an evening such as this
It's hard to tell if I exist
If I packed the car and leave this town
Will you notice that I'm not around

I could hide out under there
I just made you say 'Underwear'
I could leave but I'll just stay
All my stuff's here anyway
It's like a dream, you try to remember but it's gone
Then you try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn
When you try to see the world beyond your front door
Take your time 'coz the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile
When you realize that a guy my size might take a while
Just to try to figure out what all this is for
Try to figure out what all this is for
Try to see the world beyond your front door
Try to figure out what all this is for
