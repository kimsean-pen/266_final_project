I remember when I met you we had a right old gas
Gas, gas, gas, gas, gas
And now I'm telling you the truth we should have made that last
Last, last, last, last, last
Look at this picture, how well it's framed
I'll need your credit card and maiden name
I remember when I met you we had a right old gas

You
And
I
Have
Got
To
Get
Back
Together

Hey girl
(Who me?)
Yeah you
I've been loving what I see you do at grad school
(Oh)
Perhaps you'd come to lunch with me
(Huh?)
I'm sure I'd fine some time in my diary
Mmm, now let's see
Yeah, Monday looks quite good to me
(Monday looks quite good to me too
I'll see if I can book us a table
Someplace really, really good)

You
And
I
Have
Got
To
Get
Back
Together

You
And
I
Have
Got
To
Get
Back
Together

And even when I'm low on time
I swear, I'll spend it with you boy
You needn't worry, it's alright
I swear, I'll spend it with you
And even when I'm low on time
I swear, I'll spend it with you boy
You needn't worry, it's alright
I swear, I'll spend it with you
