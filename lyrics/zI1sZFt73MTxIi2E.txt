You never say you love but you never let me fight you
Can't get you off my mind babe so I bought this dress despite you
I wear it cause I hate you cause you don't know what you got
Gonna wear it to your house, and let you take it off
Because I want to be the one that holds you
I wanna be the one that says goodnight
I never get to see you, but you never go away
I'm talking to the ceiling and asking you to stay
and sometimes I think I lost you that you've forgotten that you cared.
Then you call me in the morning just to tell me that you're there.
That you wanna be the one who holds me
You wanna be the one who says goodnight.
I never get tired of dreaming, it's you I'm sleeping for, I wish I knew what you were thinking.
When you kiss me on the floor but
I'm not sorry that I let you that we did this whole thing wrong
and I'll never say I love you, but I meant it all along
So boy just let me hold you
So boy just let me hold you
Don't you dare say goodnight
You never say you love me, I never say I love you
You never say you love me, I'll never say I love you
But I, but I, I wanna be the one who says goodnight
