It's been a while but we're back again
With everyone of our sixth form friends
And how the hell do you look the same
Tell you the truth you're the only reason I came
With canapes and Tears For Fears
Under a banner says it's been ten years
They always play the same damn songs
I never planned on staying here so long

Ditch this reunion
It's our reunion
Just here for you again
Just here for you again

I wanna hear about the last ten years
So much has happened since you disappeared
If I still could
Then I still would
God only knows
So many things I wish I'd said back then
Can we get outta here and go somewhere
If I still could
Then I still would, yeah

So many things to talk about
Our different lives how they turned out
You know I never liked this place
It got me through the day just seeing your face
The way you look, the way you glow
It doesn't matter where I go
No matter who I bump into
It always leads me back to you

Ditch this reunion
It's our reunion
Just here for you again
Just here for you again

I wanna hear about the last ten years
So much has happened since you disappeared
If I still could
Then I still would
God only knows
So many things I wish I said back then
Can we get outta here and go somewhere
If I still could
Then I still would, yeah

I wanna hear about the last ten years
So much has happened since you disappeared
If I still could
Then I still would
God only knows
So many things I wish I said back then

If I still could
Then I still would, yeah
