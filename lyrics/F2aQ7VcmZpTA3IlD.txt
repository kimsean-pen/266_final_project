Maybe I've got this love thing so
backwards, and something keeps tripping me up.
Cause I always fall for the bad

See I'm looking for some adventure,
but most of 'em ain't got the stuff.
As long as he's driving a fast car, I know he can me that rush.
My momma told me, that he was wrong.
But when he holds me, I feel I belong.
When I'm my weakest, I can be strong.
My momma told me, that he was wrong.
I never listened to what they told me.

so I do it again, yeah, do it again. '
Cause they told me once and they told me
twice, "stop falling in love with your friends".
I never listened to what they told me,
I'll only do it again, yeah, do it again.
My friends keep on saying I'm crazy, but I'm just a hopeless in love.
I can't help myself he's my baby, but still I just can't get enough.
