It's going down, I'm yelling: "Timber!"
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget

Oh, oh, oh (Timber, timber, it's going down)

Oh, oh, oh (Timber, timber, it's going down)
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
This biggity boy's a diggity dog
I have 'em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off
Twerking in their bras and thongs (Timber)
Face down, booty up (Timber)
That's the way we like to what (Timber)
I'm slicker than an oil spill

She say she won't, but I bet she will (Timber)
Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down
Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it's going down (Oh, oh, oh)

One more shot, another round

End of the night, it's going down
It's going down, I'm yelling: "Timber!"

You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget
It's going down, I'm yelling: "Timber!"

You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night you won't remember

I'll be the one you won't forget

Oh, oh, oh (Timber, timber, it's going down)
Oh, oh, oh (Timber, timber, it's going down)
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Nah, it's just me, ain't a damn thing changed
Live in hotels, swing on planes

Blessed to say: money ain't a thing
Club jumping like LeBron now, Voli

Order me another round, homie
We about to clown, wild
'Cause it's about to go down
Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it's going down

One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down
Swing your partner round and round

End of the night, it's going down (Oh, oh, oh)
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down
It's going down, I'm yelling: "Timber!"
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget
It's going down, I'm yelling: "Timber!"
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night you won't remember
I'll be the one you won't forget
Oh, oh, oh (Timber, timber, it's going down)
Oh, oh, oh (Timber, timber, it's going down)
Oh, oh, oh (Timber, timber, it's going down)
Oh, oh, oh (Timber, you won't forget, timber)
