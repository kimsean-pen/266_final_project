Move slow
Now your time's at hand
Take heed
'Cause our love has passed

Hot fuse
Can be short or long
The time bomb
Of your life has come

People may come, people may go
Just as long as the water's slow
But watch out when you're
Headed for the waterfall

Dry land is just a love away
Warm sun and a place to lay
I see your future
The water above you calm and clear

People may come, people may go
Just as long as the water's slow
But watch out when you're
Headed for the waterfall

Love lost always makes one sad
You seem
You seem to rise instead
Feel the water, ice cool water

People may come, people may go
Just as long as the water's slow
But watch out when you're
Headed for the waterfall

People may come, people may go
Just as long as the water's slow
But watch out when you're
Headed for the waterfall, the waterfall

Feel the water, ice cool water
Feel the water, ice cool water

People may come, people may go
Just as long as the water's slow
But watch out when you're
Headed for the waterfall

People may come, people may go
Just as long as the water's slow
But watch out when you're
Headed for the waterfall

Waterfall
Waterfall
