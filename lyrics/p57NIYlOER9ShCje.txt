Brothers and sisters unite
It's the time of your lives
It's the time of your lives
Break down, break down
Gotta spread love around
Gotta spread it around

Brothers and sisters feel fine
It's the time of your lives
It's the time of your lives
No sound, no sound
Like this feeling you've found
Like this feeling you've found

But just stay down
'Cause some sounds you'll feel
So stay down
And some sounds you'll feel

And it's me they're looking for
And it's me, I will never survive
But we'll be around some more

Brothers and sisters unite
It's the time of your lives
It's the time of your lives
Break down, break down
Gotta spread love around
Gotta spread it around

But just stay down
And some sounds you'll feel
So stay 'round
And some sounds you'll feel

And it's me they're looking for
And it's me, I will never survive
But we'll be around some more

Brothers and sisters unite
Its the time of your lives
Its the time of your lives
