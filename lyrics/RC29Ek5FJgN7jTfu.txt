We don't care now
We're falling down
I've had enough

Hey-hey we're out here
Try'na get it, try'na get it done
Lost faith for a minute there
I'm working hard in the hot sun
I'm trying to keep that to myself
Just trying to keep that to myself

Yeah we're out here
And we're working hard
We're bound for glory
Collecting these stars
I'm trying to keep that to myself
Man, if this desert isn't hell

We're all dressed up in good intention
And running fast in no direction
Guess we get to rest up when we're dead
Been breaking bones and learning lessons
Try'na shake these burning questions
I can't get the fuck out of my head

Yeah we got this
We grind till dawn
Smartbombs in the closet (whoa)
Buried treasure on the front lawn
I'm trying to keep that to myself
Just trying to keep that to myself

Hell yeah we got this
Good luck is a game plan
Waistline on a wish list
Waste time in the wasteland
I'm try'na keep back from the fear
Nowadays the skies don't seem so near

We're all dressed up in good intention
Running fast in no direction
Guess we get to rest up when we're dead
Been breaking bones and learning lessons
Try'na shake these burning questions
I can't get the fuck out of my head, yeah

Oh, digging for hope in a dust bowl
Oh, I guess that we'll know when we're s'posed to know

Hell yeah we got this
Good luck is a game plan
Waistline on a wish list
Waste time in the wasteland
I'm try'na keep back from the fear
Nowadays the skies don't seem so near

We're all dressed up in good intention
And running fast in no direction
Guess we get to rest up when we're dead
Been breaking bones and learning lessons
Try'na shake these burning questions
I can't get the fuck out of my head

All dressed up in good intention
And running fast in no direction
Guess we get to rest up when we're dead
Been breaking bones and learning lessons
Try'na shake these burning questions
I can't get the fuck out of my head
Yeah
