Soon after nine
I'll have to follow you
Crossing your line
But this is your solo
The music inside
Is telling the story
Of distant skyline
You smile when it calls you

We waited so long
And tried to figure it out
Don't underestimate my love
Till I continue the fight
Just stay, hold on
Don't lose yourself to the crowd
You are confusing me,
So hard to let you leave tonight

If I had known
From the beginning
Two lives ago
I wouldn't change a thing, so
Kiss me goodbye
And if that's what you wanted to -
Sail to the dusk
There's nothing more we can do
