As we march into the night
Nothing ever feels so right
What seems hopeless, what is wrong
We're going backwards
Just hanging on
A hesitation to find ourselves
Lost confusion, there's no help
Our consciousness is always lying
Close to the end, there's no denying

And the ecstasy in the morning
Brings you to me
As we fall and drift into the world
Mixed emotions
Of all the things that hurt

As the light falls away
It's getting cold
Nothing left to say
All of our hopes and all these dreams
Our hands reach up
To end the final scene

Lay down lay down your life
Fall fall on your knife

And the ecstasy in the morning
Brings you to me
As we fall and drift into the world
Mixed emotions
Of all the things that hurt

As we jump
Jump over the side
Our broken wills
Finally subside
As the light falls away
It's getting cold
Nothing left to say
