What becomes of me
When you stop listening?
Do I disappear into the silence?
Or return from the void with brand new life?
Will I find a resting place?
Somewhere to wash my hands and face
Gathering the harvaged for all I need
Collapsing into this place of ease

I'm singing my death song
Singing my death song
Singing my death song
This is my death song
Singing my death song
Singing my death song
Singing my death song
Singing my death song
Singing my death song
Singing my death song
Singing my death song
This is my death song
