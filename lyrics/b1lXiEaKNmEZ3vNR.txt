It's gone from light to gray
But I'll move those clouds away
Letting the sun shine through
In this ode to you

Let the demons have their place
If so it's angels you'll create
And disguised within the dark
Light will wait

My heart, I owe you my soul

Will you please accept
Please accept this offer
This is all for you
Transcend

We flip towards the sun
Wheels skidding on the run
A flowing sea of red
The whole city grows

My heart, I owe you my soul

Will you please accept
Please accept this offer
This is all for you
Transcend

Will you please accept
Please accept this offer
This is all for you
Transcend

Fiasco

Rubberneck
Passing motorists
A mangled tuna-can-car rests
Repair this tattered skin
Hold it in your hand
You've already glistened through the window
You've already set us all
free, free, free

Please accept
Please accept this offer
This is all for you
Transcend

Will you please accept
Please accept this offer
This is all for you
Transcend

Fiasco
