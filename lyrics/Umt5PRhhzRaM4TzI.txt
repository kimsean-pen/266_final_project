Come on pretty baby
Won't you come over
Come over here and shake that thing
I don't wanna know you
I just wanna show you
How I make all the boys insane
Come on pretty baby
Won't you entertain me
We could make a video
We don't need a story
We'll film into the morning
I'll show you everything I know
I got you in my sights
And maybe tonight
You're gonna be mine
(Chorus)
Cause I'm a lady
Can you be my ladies man?
I'm waiting
Can you show me?
Can, you can be my man
I'll tell you what I need
And you best be good at pleasing
No time left to figure it out
I know you see my cruising
In my silver lincoln

Looking for my mister right now
I'm pushing over the drive
Come on get inside
Let's go for a ride
(Chorus)
Cause I'm a lady
Can you be my ladies man?
I'm waiting
Can you show me?
Can, you can be my man
Come on baby, yea
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, yeah
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Come on pretty baby
Won't you come over
Come over here and shake that thing
(Chorus)
Cause I'm a lady
Can you be my ladies man?
I'm waiting
Can you show me?
Can, you can be my man
Yea, I'm a lady
Can you be my ladies man?
I'm waiting
Can you show me?
Can, you can be my man
