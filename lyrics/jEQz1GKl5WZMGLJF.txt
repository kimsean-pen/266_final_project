They said to us as if we understood
But I did not want a new name
You were the ones calling up to the saints

We should have been out playing ball
Instead we were trapped behind these brick walls
So we got down to pray
Your testaments would soon be gone away

We didn't know what to say
We had nothing to confess that day
Please excuse me, I'm a disgrace
'Grace, 'grace, 'grace
We didn't know what to say
We had nothing to confess that day
Anything to get out of this place
Place, place, place

"You're going to live and break bread"
They said to us and it stuck in our heads
But I did not want to love greed
I was the one who was going insane

We should have been out playing ball
Instead we were trapped behind these brick walls
So we got down to pray
Your testaments would soon be gone away

We didn't know what to say
We had nothing to confess that day
Please excuse me, I'm a disgrace
'Grace, 'grace, 'grace
We didn't know what to say
We had nothing to confess that day
Anything to get out of this place
Place, place, place

It's okay, I don't mind
It's not like I had anytime for you
Oh, it is so divine
Place it on my tongue you do

Shall we see who's pullin' the strings?
Shall we see who's pullin' the strings?
Shall we see who's pullin' the strings?
Shall we see who's pullin' the strings?
Shall we see who's pullin' the strings?
Shall we see who's pullin' the strings?
Shall we see who's pullin' the strings?
Shall we see who's pullin' the strings?
