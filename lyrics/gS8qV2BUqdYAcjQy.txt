Your hand in my hand and my hand in your hand
Your hand in my hand closeness of the past
My hand in your hand and your hand in my hand
Jerking back and nothing will last

I have to go before it is too late
Have to wipe out the traces and memories will fade
And tears will stop flowing and tears will stop flowing
And memories will fade and memories will fade

Over and done Over and done
Over and done Over and done
Over and done Over and done
Over and done Over and done

Dead and frozen my heart Over and done
My life falling apart Over and done
Dead an frozen my heart Over and done
My life falling apart Over and done
Over and done Over and done

Your voice in my voice and my voice in your voice
Your voice in my voice sweet echoes of the past
Your voice from the call-box your voice at the door
Don't want that anymore and nothing will last

Have to plug my ears before it's too late
Have to put on the glow and memories will fade
And tears will stop flowing and tears will stop flowing
And memories will fade and memories will fade

Over and done Over and done
Over and done Over and done
Over and done Over and done
Over and done Over and done

Dead and frozen my heart Over and done
My life falling apart Over and done
Dead an frozen my heart Over and done
My life falling apart Over and done
Over and done Over and done

Your eyes in my eyes and my eyes in your eyes
Your eyes in my eyes faint glimmer of the past
My eyes in your eyes and your eyes in my eyes
Shine turns dull and nothing will last

Have to look away before it's too late
Have to put out the fire and memories will fade
And tears will stop flowing and tears will stop flowing
And memories will fade and memories will fade

Dead and frozen my heart Over and done
My life falling apart Over and done
Dead and frozen my heart Over and done
My life falling apart Over and done
Dead and frozen my heart Over and done
My life falling apart Over and done
Dead and frozen my heart Over and done
My only sun over and done
My only sun over and done
Over and done Over and done
