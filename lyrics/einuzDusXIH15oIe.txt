Wrist cry

Flying in the sky, going to a lonely star tonight, tonight
I'm falling through the clouds
Can't deny I got you on my mind, on my mind
Blood is on my mind
Blade is on my wrist it makes it cry, make it cry
I feel like I could die
I feel like I don't care if I survive, I survive

Wrist cry

I'm faceless in this kind of situation
I know what you are playing
Trying to drive me crazy
Trying to be something that you can't be
I am in a mansion, something that you can't reach
Fuck him I'm gonna put him on the blacklist
Pull up in a lotus, think I have a death wish
I'm forever young might let the coke drip
I don't give a fuck I get my throat slit

Wrist cry

I'm falling through the clouds
Can't deny I got you on my mind, on my mind
I feel like I could die, I feel like I don't care if I survive, I survive
