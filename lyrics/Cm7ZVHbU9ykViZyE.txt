(Two kids)

I met you at a bus stop, told me your name
Said you wanna make it big, wanna play in the game
Well, I never really thought much of it back then
Dinners and dates took our lives to shape
We built the house, didn't know if they'd stay
Well, I never saw you quit
Not now, not back then

And you stayed by me
When the storms came down and the fear got real
You stayed by me

And all we'll ever be is two kids (Two kids)
Making our way through this great, big city
Two kids (Two kids)
Watching the lights 'cause they look so pretty
Two kids
I never would've guessed we'd end up like this
Oh, oh, oh
I never would've guessed it

Like brother and sister, we kept so tight
Didn't let the others try to change our minds
We never let them win
Not now, not back then
And when the going got rough and the pain felt strong
I cried inside but you stayed so calm
And you never let them win
Not now, not back then

And you stayed by me
When the storms came down and the fear got real
You stayed by me

And all we'll ever be is two kids (Two kids)
Making our way through this great, big city
Two kids (Two kids)
Watching the lights 'cause they look so pretty
Two kids
I never would've guessed we'd end up like this
Oh, oh, oh
I never would've guessed it

All the boxes and the stage lights
All the words and all the late nights
All the faces, all the silence
All the panic, all the crying
I met you at a bus stop, told me your name
Said you wanna make it big, wanna play in the game, oh
I met you at a bus stop, told me your name
Now you're like a brother
Now you're playing the game

And all we'll ever be is two kids (Two kids)
Making our way through this great, big city
Two kids (Two kids)
Watching the lights 'cause they look so pretty
Two kids
I never would've guessed we'd end up like this
Oh, oh, oh
I never would've guessed it

Oh, all the boxes and the stage lights (Two kids)
All the words and all the late nights
All the faces, all the silence (Two kids)
All the panic, all the crying
I met you at a bus stop, told me your name
Said you wanna make it big, wanna play in the game, oh
I met you at a bus stop, told me your name
Now you're like a brother
Now you're playing the game
