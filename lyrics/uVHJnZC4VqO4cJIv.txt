I'm wasting my life
I'm wasting my life

I'm a pro, I'm a procrastinator
A thick kid, but why does it matter to you
Do you smoke or are you just a poser?

Out of touch, out of sight, out of order
I ain't bad, I'm just another damaged good
A screw up, but I can quit when I want to

I'm wasting my life
I'm wasting my life

I drink pop, drink pop for the sugar
I speak french because I've got nothing
Toulouse
Make jokes but I really love my mother

I'm wasting my life
I'm wasting my life

I'm wasting my life (my life, my life)
I'm wasting my life (my life, my life)

I'm a pro, I'm a procrastinator
I ain't bad, I'm just another damaged good
Make jokes but I really love my mother
