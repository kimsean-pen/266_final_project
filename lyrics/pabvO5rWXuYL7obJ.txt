Now let me say this about that
We might not know where we are at
Where we have been, where we are going
And it might not be worth it knowing
We're unequipped for the comprehension
How we tripped into this dimension
That about this let me say
For the race it's a wonderful day

What a wonderful day for the race
Everywhere it's taking place
I swear you'll hear one wasn't run
But I'm talking bout the human one

Is there a better understanding
Why it was we wound up landing
Where our feet are firmly planted
Not so firmly we were granted
The permission and the clearance
Let there be no interference
Anyhow, but either way
For the race it's a wonderful day

What a wonderful for the race
Everywhere it's taking place
I swear you'll hear one wasn't run
But I'm talking bout the human one

What a wonderful for the race
Every smile on every face
Every day until it's done
I'm talking bout the human one

What a wonderful for the race
Every smile on every face
Every day until it's done
I'm talking bout the human one
The human one

What a wonderful for the race
Everywhere it's taking place
I swear you'll hear one wasn't run
But I'm talking bout the human one

What a wonderful for the race
Every smile on every face
Every day until it's done
I'm talking bout the human one
The human one
