Oh whoa, whoa
Where'd she go
Where did my love run
I want back the way it was
I saw you in leather
Oh a bit of a rebel
And the dance on my lips while I'm glued to yours
Yeah they were
And do you believe it
And you can't deceive it
But love sprung from my face onto this day
And now I'm singin'
Oh whoa, whoa
Where did she go
Where did my love run
I want back the way it was, yeah (yes, yes, yes)
Oh whoa, whoa
Give me the time
Give me the clock 'cause
I want back the way it was (yes)
'Cause love can be so blind
And I was just too kind
And she thinks I'm fake and everybody knows
(everybody knows) Yeah they do
And I was all for it
And then stung like a hornet
When she keeps me I'm sure it will be the last
Now I'm singin'
Oh whoa, whoa
Where did she go (where did she go)
Where did my love run
I want back the way it was (yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh whoa, whoa
Give me the time (give me the time now)
Give me the clock 'cause
I want back the way it was

Oh whoa, whoa
Where did she go
Where did my love run
I want back the way it was
Oh whoa, whoa
Give me the time (give me the time now)
Give me the clock 'cause
I want back the way it was
Oh whoa, whoa
Where did she go
Where did my love run
I want back the way it was
Oh whoa, whoa
Give me the time
Give me the clock 'cause
I want back the way it was
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
