So you don't believe in magic
I'm never falling from these habits
No
Who's ever really static
Just take my honor, you can have it

Don't get all sentimental about it, oh no
The sun comes up, the rain comes down
There ain't nothing you can do to change it
Don't get all sentimental about it, oh no
Life's not fair
Empathy is overrated

Look the other way
Always been my game
Got a way of cleaning
All the shame tryna stain to my name
Look the other way
Darkness in the shade
Got away with feeling
Like I'm faking every single breath I take

Don't get all sentimental about it, oh no
The sun comes up, the rain comes down
There ain't nothing you can do to change it
Don't get all sentimental about it, oh no
Life's not fair
Empathy is overrated

Look the other way
Always been my game
Got a way of cleaning
All the shame tryna stain to my name
Look the other way
Darkness in the shade
Got away with feeling
Like I'm faking every single breath I take

Look the other way
Always been my game
Got away pretending
Like I'm faking every single word I say

Come up in my closet I'ma get you fat
That's a chill initial feeling when I come right back
I can see the orchids blooming out your beautiful crack
Since my head is now my belly
I need big brain snacks
Welcome to my odd ass city with the lopsided loaves
The limp wristed winded sex on abdomen
What's my style I'm blind to dude tooth clang
Chomp real loud I tuned out all intervals
Looking through the glass watching eyes cry glitter
Slid in on a sack laced in body suit slipper
I'ma peel in two and then shed my image
Turn into some panoramic spinning gold bridges
