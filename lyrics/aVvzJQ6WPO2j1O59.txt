We are far apart from everyone that we have lost now
I just haven't got the heart
Don't explain yourself
'Cause no one else can help but you
You're a voice without a sound ahh

I've lost everything you've ever seen
Feel so much blessed now
It's a measure what you love
You hear them far way you call to stay
But they're already gone to leading us the way ahh
