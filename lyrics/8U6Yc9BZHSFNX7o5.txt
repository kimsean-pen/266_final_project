Don't need to pray
Don't need to bow
But we are true believers when the sun goes down
Here on the rock
Look out to space
Don't need no gravity to hold our love in place
The solar heat
Get off the seat
A combination to the place where planets meet
Sharpen up the knives
But not to kill
We're gonna slice the night right open, let it spill

Oh, let me show you
Oh, let me show you
Oh, let me show you
Oh, let me show you
You've got to live right now {right now)

No need to think
Just got to do
Went through the rhythms of the uni, it's true
Come let it go
Just seize the day
You leave too fast, you'll never know, that's all I say

Get up, now fall in love
Get up, now fall apart
Get up, now fall apart
Get up, now fall in love

Just keep holding onto love
Just keep holding onto love
