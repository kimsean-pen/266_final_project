I wish I had a metal heart
I could cross the line
I wish I was half as good
As you think I am

Now that we know for sure
They're telling lies
When they say no one gets hurt and therefore nobody dies
You know it's hard to believe anything that you hear
They say the world is round

I wish I was as big as you
You'd have to tell the truth
I'd be nothing you could hurt
Nothing you could use

Now that we know for sure
They're telling lies
When they say no one gets hurt and therefore nobody dies
You know it's hard to believe anything that you hear
They say the world is round
The world is round

I want to be dependable
I want to be courageous and good
I want to be faithful so that I can be heroic and true
I want to be your friend you can rely on
You can lean on and trust
I want to understand so I can forgive
And be willing to love

I wish I wasn't flesh and blood
I would not be scared
Of bullets meant with me in mind
Then I could be saved

My sweet lord, take care of me for I think I'm done
Kiss my mother on her cheek and lay my burden down
Lay my burden down

Now that we know for sure
They're telling lies
When they say no one gets hurt and therefore nobody dies
You know it's hard to believe anything that you hear
They say the world is round
The world is round
The world is round
The world is round
