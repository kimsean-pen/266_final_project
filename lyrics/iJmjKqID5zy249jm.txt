Don't, you mess,
With a little girl's dream.
'Cause she's liable to grow up,
Mean.

Surprise you to find that I'm laughing?
You thought that you'd find me in tears.
You thought I'd be crawling,
The walls like a tiny mosquito,
And trembling in fear.

Well, you may be king for the moment,
But I am a queen understand,
And I've got your pawns and your bishops and,
Castles,
All inside the palm of my hand.

While you were looking the other way,
While you had your eyes closed.
While you were licking your lips,
'Cause I was miserable.
While you were selling your soul.
While you were tearing a hole,
In me.
I was taking control.
Now I have taken control. (I have... control...)
Now I have taken control. (I have... control...)
Now I have taken control.
Control...

This is beginning to feel good,
Watching you squirm in your shoes,
A small bead of sweat on your brow,
And a growl in your belly,
You're scared to let through.
You thought you could keep me from loving,
You thought you could feed on my soul.
But while you were busy destroying my life,
What was half in me has become whole.

While you were looking the other way.
While you had your eyes closed.
While you were licking your lips,
'Cause I was miserable.
While you were selling your soul.
While you were tearing a hole,
In me.
I was taking control
Now I have taken control. (I have... control...)
Now I have taken control. (I have... control...)
Now I have taken control.
Control...

So this is how it feels,
To breathe in the summer air.
To feel the sand between my toes,
And love inside my ear.

All those things, you taught me to fear,
I've got them in my garden now and,
You're not welcome here.

Come here.

Come a little bit closer...
Let me look at you.
I gave you the benefit of the doubt it's true,
But keep in mind my darling,
Not every saint is a fool!

(Don't)
While you were looking the other way, (you mess)
While you had your eyes closed. (with me)
While you were licking your lips,
'Cause I was miserable.
(Don't)
While you were selling your soul (you mess)
While you were tearing a hole,
In me.
(I was taking control)
Now I have taken control. (I was taking control)
Now I have taken control. (control)
Control...
(Control)
Control...
Don't you mess with me.

(Spoken)
This cannot be all that there is to life,
Because, in our confrontation, with,
An enormous and cold, universe.
There is something comical, to the idea
That we can really enforce our will, on humanity.
Power, corrupts.

It's your world, do with it what you want!
No, that's not the way to do it.
Power... That's not the way to do it.
Paradox
No
It's your world
No
It's your world
No
It's your world
NO!

Control it! Control it!

(This is scaring me...

I live at the end of a 5 and 1/2 minute hallway
I live at the end of a 5 and 1/2 minute hallway)

At the end of it all lies of course the final phenomenon of deterioration
Entropy
Which is a predictable deterioration when the creative energy ceases...
