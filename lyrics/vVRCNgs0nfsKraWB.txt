I drank from the right glass
I'm takin' the right path
But it is testing me
I'll have the last laugh
Down at the work task
They'll get the best of me
Oh, the cup of destiny
I drank from the right glass
I'm takin' the right path
But it is testing me
I'll have the last laugh
Down at the work task
They'll get the best of me
Oh, the cup of destiny

Well you never really know it till it hits ya
You see it in your face, an old school picture
You pour yourself one every night
It doesn't mean that you're wrong or right
Look at the bottle, look at the glass
There is your future, there is your past
It all makes sense when you get some

It doesn't matter if you're old or all done
I drank from the right glass
I'm takin' the right path
But it is testing me
I'll have the last laugh
Down at the work task
They'll get the best of me
Oh, the cup of destiny
I drank from the right glass
I'm takin' the right path

But it is testing me

I'll have the last laugh
Down at the work task
They'll get the best of me
Oh, the cup of destiny

Well you never really know it till it hits ya

You see it in your face, an old school picture
You pour yourself one every night

It doesn't mean that you're wrong or right
Look at the bottle, look at the glass
There is your future, there is your past
It all makes sense when you get some
It doesn't matter if you're old or all done
I drank from the right glass
I'm takin' the right path
But it is testing me
I'll have the last laugh
Down at the work task
They'll get the best of me
Oh, the cup of destiny
I drank from the right glass
I'm takin' the right path
But it is testing me
I'll have the last laugh
Down at the work task
They'll get the best of me
Oh, the cup of destiny...
