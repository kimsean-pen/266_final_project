Say you wanna get in
And then you wanna get out
When you get the money
To buy yourself a castle

How will you wear your leisure?
You zipper back and front
On the fence together
Weekends in leather

Flip to the right
And slip back to the left
For handshakes at the ranch
And small talk at the crossroads

Rubbing up to the ladder
Sucking on every rung
Coming up forever
And hanging on

That's entertainment
Where my camera's roll
Can you face the pavement
For a happy dog and pony show?

Everybody loves you baby
Off course they do
Do you miss me?
I miss you

Buy this car to drive to work
Drive to work to pay for this car
Buy this car to drive to work
Drive to work

Buy this car to drive to work
Drive to work to pay for this car

Buy this car to drive to work
Drive to work to pay for this car

Say you wanna get in
And you're gonna get out
But you won't
'Cause it's a trap
