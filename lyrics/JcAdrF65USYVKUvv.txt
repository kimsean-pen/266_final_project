Be still, and go on to bed
Nobody knows what lies ahead
Life is short, to say the least
We're in the belly of the beast
Be still, wild and young
Long may your innocence reign
Like shells on the shore
May your limits be unknown, may your efforts be your own
If you ever feel you can't take it anymore

Don't break character, you've got a lot of heart
Is this real or just a dream?
Rise up like the sun, labour till the work is done

Be still, one day you leave
Fearlessness on your sleeve
When you come back, tell me what did you see?
Was there something out there for me?

Be still, close your eyes
Soon enough you'll be on your own, steady and straight
And if they drag you through the mud
It doesn't change what's in your blood
When they knock you down
Don't break character, you've got a lot of heart
Is this real or just a dream?

Be still, be still
Be still, be still

Over rock and chain, over sunset plain
Over trap and snare, when you're in too deep
In your wildest dream, in your made up schemes
When they knock you down, when they knock you down
Don't break character, you've got so much heart
Is this real or just a dream?

Rise up like the sun and labour till the work is done
Rise up like the sun and labour till the work is
Rise up like the sun and labour till the work is done.
