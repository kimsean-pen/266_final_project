I'm making waves with the girl down the street
She tells me secrets I don't think I can keep
She's got a brother in the big house, bigger ideas than me
But I'm making waves with the girl down the street

She thinks its good that I say what I mean
Don't waste her time with the space in between
She gives me reasons for her actions, seem reasonable to me
She gives me help when I deserve it and that's good enough for me

Somebody called it a long shot
Somebody called it a long shot

You think you know what I need (you want to tell me something)
You think you see what I see (you want to tell me something)
And when this comes to an end

You don't really know what
You cant quite put all your fingers on it tell me that you
Really see the options that I'm giving to you
You tell me secrets that I'll keep and I wont say a thing to you

Somebody called it a long shot
Somebody called it a long shot

You think you know what I need (you want to tell me something)
You think you see what I see (you want to tell me something)
And when this comes to an end
You'll say darling
Somebody called it a long shot
Somebody will call it a long shot

You think you know what I need (you want to tell me something)
You think you see what I see (you want to tell me something)
And when this comes to an end
You'll say darling
Somebody called it a long shot
Somebody will call it a long shot
