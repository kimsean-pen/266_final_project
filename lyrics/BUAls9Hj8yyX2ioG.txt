Talking to yourself
You say things
No one ever hears
Knowing yourself better
Than anyone ever could
Bet you never thought you would
Honesty prevails in thought
You just can't lie to yourself
A patch of lucrid decisions
A thought of fame and wealth

Chorus

A caravan or process if you will
A stream of conscious waves
A prostitute of ideas
A maze of tracing knowledge
First and foremost feed your head!

Retrieve all that flows with memory
Obtain all you know with sensories
Approaching every vision with indecision
Conditioning is a routine of minds
Recruiting all the intellect if finds
Insecurity is merely your fear
Of maybe the outside hearing what you hear
Can't let 'em see,
Don't let 'em hear

Projecting like an airplane in flight
I dream of things
That just aren't quite right
A projecter shines on the back of my eyes
So my position of perception can rise

(Repeat chorus)

Insecurity is merely your fear
Of maybe the outside hearing what you hear
Don't let 'em see,
Can't let 'em hear
