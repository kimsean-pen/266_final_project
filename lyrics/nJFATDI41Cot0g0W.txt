Boys Boys be my boy (I wanna feel your body)
Boys Boys be my boy (Tonight I'm ready honey)
Boys Boys be my boy (I wanna be your lover girl)
Be my lover boy

Boys Boys be my boy (I wanna feel your body)
Boys Boys be my boy (Tonight I'm ready honey)
Boys Boys be my boy (I wanna be your lover girl)
Be my lover boy

Hot summer time
Always something on my mind
A kind of magic in the air
I'm on the run
To a sunny paradise
With crowded beaches everywhere

I'm just a girl who's looking for some fun
It's time to get things started
So common everybody

Boys Boys be my boy (I wanna feel your body)
Boys Boys be my boy (Tonight I'm ready honey)
Boys Boys be my boy (I wanna be your lover girl)
Be my lover boy

Hot summer night
Always makes me loose control
It feels like heaven now I'm free

And all the boys
If you want to feel the heat
Just come along and play with me

I'm just a girl who's looking for some fun
It's time to get things started
So common everybody

Boys Boys be my boy (I wanna feel your body)
Boys Boys be my boy (Tonight I'm ready honey)
Boys Boys be my boy (I wanna be your lover girl)
Be my lover boy
