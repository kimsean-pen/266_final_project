Do you wanna come over later, to my house?
Watch American beauty in the dark.
And I'll hold your hand till the very end, the very end.
And we'll stay awake till tomorrow starts.

Do you wanna come over later, to my house?
Listen to your favourite songs,
We'll pretend the words ain't true they don't mean anything to you, but.

Do you wanna come over later.
To my house

I've been smoking too much lately, I can feel it on my chest.
But I'll stand in the garden with you.
I didn't get much sleep last night but that's alright,
It was worth it just to see you move that hair from your eyes
and
smile like you do.

Stay with me tonight
I'll kiss your head to the morning
I'll let you sleep on my side, of the bed girl

Stay with me tonight
I'll kiss your head to the morning
I'll let you sleep on my side, of the bed girl
