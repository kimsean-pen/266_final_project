Coming in this world fully naked
Feeling brand new so I'm your baby
Never felt this safe, in a foreign place
I used to feel so hollow, shallow, vacant
When you're 'round you closin' all these spaces
All the things we made
Finally erased

So bad it should be forbidden
So good, so deep, I feel it

Your love is like a higher power
I'm born, I'm born, I'm born again, again
'Cause every time you love me harder
I'm born, I'm born, I'm born again, again

Roses for the dead and I want danger
Feeling so alive because I crave ya
Passion, pleasure, pain
It all feels the same
Hotter than the sun so need to save me
Got me on my knees so come and pray with me
Flooding like a rain
Feel like 40 days

So bad it should be forbidden
So good, so deep, I feel it
I'm reborn

Your love is like a higher power
I'm born, I'm born, I'm born again, again
'Cause every time you love me harder
I'm born, I'm born, I'm born again, again

I'm born, I'm born, I'm born, I'm born, I'm born again, again
I'm born again, again
I'm born, I'm born, I'm born, I'm born, I'm born again, again
I'm born again, again

Never, never leave
I finally believe
'Cause I give all my faith in

Your love is like a higher power
I'm born, I'm born, I'm born again, again
'Cause every time you love me harder
I'm born, I'm born, I'm born again, again

Every time, every time that I call I feel awakened
When you dive in the tides of the ocean I feel heaven
It's like the first time, first time when you loved me naked
I'm born, I'm born, I'm born again again
