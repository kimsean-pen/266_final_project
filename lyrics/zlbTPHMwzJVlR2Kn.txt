Baby you dont know
what you do to me
Between me and you
i feel a chemistry
I wont let no one
come and take your place
cause the love you give
it cant be replaced
See no one else
love me like you do
thats why i dont mind
to spend my life with you
I wanna please you
in any way i can
I wanna share my world
dont you understand

Your love is a one and a million
it goes on and on and on
you give me a really good feeling
all day long
your love is a one and a million
it goes on and on and on
you give me a really good feeling
all day long

turn me inside out
make my heart speak
need no one else
you are all i need
personality in everything you do
it makes me love everything bout you
your smile
your style
is so fly
i cant deny
I got a crush on you
and that is true indeed
and im digging you
you make me believe)
