Ghost in the moonlight
Throw your veil upon these grounds
Cold! The night is star-bright
Pale is all beauty of your gown

Dark, frame a fire
Mystery of a blood red rose
Dark, shine sapphire
You won't leave me on my own

Raised my head above the haze
I woke up to a world
I feel almost humanized
Tender loving all around
Apparently profound
Through self-deceitful eyes

Now what am I supposed to be
For sure it can't be me
In orderly array
My, it's feeling so unreal
How daunting to be free
In the light of day
Lost in this world
With no place to go

Awaiting the night to yell a prayer up to the starlight
Veiling boon, ghost in the moon
Grant me admission tonight
Into your tenebrous wicked star-bright
Golden gloom, ghost in the moon

Whispers sounding from the brake
Sinister eyes along the way
A phantom rushing through the night
Making haste, run from the dawn
Back across the Rubicon
To the shelter from the light

Before the sun is gonna rise
To reflect it in their eyes
A sight no one's gonna stand
Oh your blood is gonna freeze
Different blood, a different breed
No one's gonna comprehend

They teach you love
They make you belong
Suck you in to spit you out
The rage is on

Awaiting the night to yell a prayer up to the starlight
Veiling boon, ghost in the moon
Grant me admission tonight
Into your tenebrous wicked star-bright
Golden gloom, ghost in the moon

Like a rushing thunder
You're a shade in the swampland
And a Trojan horse they'd rowel into your dreams
They chase you into dawn
To a silken bed of quicksand
Rush, so you can breathe, they'll give you up
You're in my world past remedy

Asking, wondering, look at me
Waiting, prompting
I may be drawn to something
That I can't phrase for you
Even though it's true
I won't be what they long to see in me
No matter how desperately
They reach out for me

A sedating hand
They don't understand
I don't comprehend
I can't take no more
Of their shallow light
Burning me inside
Then I am better off a scorn in the night

I am rumour, I am nightmare
That I'm bound to dream myself
Half human and it's frightening
To just guess the other half

I'm a misfit on a journey
And I'm afraid my destiny
Has been sealed right from the outset
To immure the real me
I'll wane in this world
Just me and the glow of the moon
Yeah wow

For the chill of the night is gonna summon a fire
A strange world on the brink, or a maniacal dream?
Dead matter alive, heart, soul and desire
Rise from the smoke and the fire
From maniacal dreams
Crucible-born and unseen
Megalo-maniacal dream
Megalo-maniacal dream

To chase the ghost in the moonglow
Throw your gown upon the light
Ghost in the moonglow
Whisper from the starlit skies

Dark frame a fire
Mystery of a blood red rose
Moon spark a fire
You won't leave me on my own
