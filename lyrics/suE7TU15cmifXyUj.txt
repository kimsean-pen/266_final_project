I got too much time, too much time
I got too much time to be without love
In my life I've got a deep devotion
Wide as the sky and deep as the ocean
Every war that's waged makes me cry
Every bird that goes by gets me high

Sometimes when it's late and I'm a little bit hungry I heat
up some old stale beans, open up a can of sardines, eat crackers and
dreams of somebody to cook for me.

[Repeat chorus, verse and chorus]
