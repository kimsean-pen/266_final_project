Ba ba ba ba bada ba!

We make our own mythologies
Yr maps won't let us down again
Yr legends all played out
Yr keeping some dark secrets,
But you talk in your sleep

We make our own mythologies
All gangster scenes and bullet scars
Yr fashion's three months late
If I had the guts I promise I would...

Cut the powerlines
Tape the letterbox shut
I don't worry about those things
I don't worry about those...
From on grey mess to another grey mess
Distance knows a heavy heart best

Eve(ry) sin(gle), sin(gle) night (out)
For a lifetime of college films
(A sign! A sign! A sign! A sign!)
I'm hoping, I'm hoping, I'm hoping you don't call

Tear down our nightclubs, put up flats
Burn down our pubs and put up flats
All rows of neat new tracts
Why'd you want to live here if there's nothing but housing?

Yr boyfriend owns the bar, we drink
Yr boyfriend ruins everything
In a room with blinds drawn down
If I had the guts I promise I would...

Cut the powerlines
Tape the letterbox shut
I don't worry about those things
I don't worry about those...
From on grey mess to another grey mess
Distance knows a heavy heart best

Eve(ry) sin(gle), sin(gle) night (out)
For a lifetime of college films
(A sign! A sign! A sign! A sign!)
I'm hoping, I'm hoping, I'm hoping you don't call
