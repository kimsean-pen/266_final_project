Just like the cliffs at seaside
I lay head against the search of todays work

The warm colours you've spread
Through my house and my rooms
Were deceased too

You'd ask me not to drown deep
I'm feeling just too close to you
And fear

And with [?]
The fever keeps around
And me and you

This is for days to come
With no one else to blame
Sorry for this mess to rearrange
This is for days to come
You hold it in your hands
Desolation leads me again and again

I'm gonna need some rest now
To put some sense into this mess
All around me
The warm colours you've spread
Through my house and my rooms
Were deceased too

You'd ask me not to drown deep
I'm feeling just too close to you
And fear

This is for days to come
With no one else to blame
Sorry for this mess to rearrange
This is for days to come
You hold it in your hands
Desolation leads me again and again

And again and again
For days to come
For days to come

A believer in hollowness and fever
I can see her
I can feel her
Always find a place to hide

I could heal her
Oh [?] fever
Always find a place to hide
