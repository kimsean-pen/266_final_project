Chico Fernandez
Livin' on a gun
Dreams of Santa Anna
Fighting in the sun
Drums so loud from outside
Makes it hard to dream
A rain is fallin' hard and fast
Makes it all seem real
Mornin' come mornin
A Chico's gotta have his share
Mornin', sad mornin'
Said he must bebe

Mornin', sad mornin'
What a laugh, and I cried
And I cry, cry, cry, cry, cried

Mornin', sad mornin'
Mexican

Se√±orita pining
Chico come on home
Santa Anna's losing
You'll be first to go
Sam Houston's laughing
Davy Crockett too
When Anna takes the Alamo
The first to go is you
Mornin', come mornin'
A Chico's gotta have his share
Mornin', sad mornin'
Heaven will be there
Mornin', sad mornin'
What a laugh and out loud
Ha ha ha ha ha
