It's all such a blur when time goes so quickly
Trying to hang on to
The way that you'd like things to stay

You trace back the seconds
Recall the details
From someone will, to someone does
To someone did, you know I did

Oh there must be a hole in your memory
But I can see
I can see a distant victory
A time when you will be with me

You cut me off just as I was starting to speak
The language you keep hidden away
It's just like the question on everyone's lips

But it's not on mine
Where all you'll find is a twisted smile
From another time

Another time, another time
Oh there must be a hole in your memory
But I can see
I can see a distant victory
A time when you will be with me...

Another time, another time
Oh there must be a hole in your memory
But I can see
I can see a distant victory
A time when you will be with me

There'd be another time, another time
Oh there must be a hole in your memory
But I can see
I can see a distant victory
A time when you will be with me

I can see that there's got to be another time
There's got to be...
