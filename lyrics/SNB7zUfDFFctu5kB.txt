would you be embarrassed,
think I'm being careless,
if I said you're all I want and more
finger tips and collarbones,
if I caught you on your own,
would you mind my hand stitched into yours
I got it bad, bad, oh
I see you in my sleep
and I want you mad, madly
come running after me
you're in my bones bones
oh I gotta let you go
but I don't know how when you're rooted in my soul
I gotta tell you
I had a dream last night you came back to me after our goodbye
My arms you fell into and you asked if I'd run away with you
I ain't felt that way before like I couldn't wait just a minute more
and I don't wanna let you go,
but dreams slip away I know
You saw me clear as glass
I thought you bold as brass,
never knew how lovely love could be
forty hours give or take you
call me when you are awake
and from our phones we'll crumble time and space
I need you here here oh I see you in my sleep
and I want you dear dearly come running after me
you're in my bones bones
oh I gotta let you go
but I don't know how
when you're rooted in my soul
I gotta tell you
I had a dream last night you came back to me after our goodbye
My arms you fell into and you asked if I'd run away with you
I ain't felt that way before like I couldn't wait just a minute more
and I don't wanna let you go,
but dreams slip away I know
I don't know if you still think of me (come on come on over)
how you used to love me lovingly (come on come on over)
I know when we left we left a mess (come on come on over)
but if you ask, I promise I'll say... (come on come on)

I had a dream last night you came back to me after our goodbye
My arms you fell into and you asked if I'd run away with you
I ain't felt that way before like I couldn't wait just a minute more
and I don't wanna let you go,
but dreams slip away I know
