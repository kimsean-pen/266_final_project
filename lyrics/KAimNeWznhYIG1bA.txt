I know where the whites in your eyes have gone
I know why you want to live alone
And you're mumbling something I don't want to hear
Our house is small and it's making you unwell
I love crawling but you're breaking yourself
Can I make your favorite meal before you move out?

You don't have to collapse anymore
Your home won't be a trap anymore
And you need it
Ooh child

When you're needy and seedless
You're hungry, I'll feed it
I'll come flirt all of you

When you're needy and seedless
You're hungry, I'll feed it
I'll come flirt all of you

(walking like a)
I'm walking like a virgin again
The edge of the sidewalk is mine
If I avoid crowds can I keep the sex off my mind?
(don't deny, don't deny)
I wanna fuck but can we read about it first
Is our bedroom safe? I don't want us to get hurt
Some day I'll give you what you deserve

You don't have to strain anymore
This house won't be a drain anymore
When you're needy

When you're needy and seedless
You're hungry, I'll feed it
I'll come flirt all of you

I'm sorry for being petty please don't forget me
And I'll be good to you if you return, return
Please return, Oh, woah, woah
I won't suffocate you anymore
I'll be just right for you
