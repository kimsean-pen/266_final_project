This could be destiny, oh sweetheart
I've had no sense of time since we started
I've got friends in need, oh sweetheart
I'd grown lengths and lengths and lengths of love since we started this thing out

Combat salacious removal

There is a bitter breed, oh sweetheart
They will be watching you sometimes with their bitter hearts
But we are through with these
Oh, we're shifting the heartache
We want strong summer love, the most robust of blood
Just to stay awake
