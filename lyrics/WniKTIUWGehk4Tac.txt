Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
I give 'em hell, won't wish 'em well
Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
I'm raising hell, send 'em to hell

Back in the dark, I'm mysterious
Laughing away 'til I do something serious
Attitude only imperious
Rest all my enemies like I'm insidious
These times I'm feeling so hideous
Fuck everybody, I murder you idiots
I am a little perfidious
Fuck a civilian, we're not equivalent
I am a little delirious
Suck my balls, stomach, drop balls
Islamic flow so dead, sonic
I hear that life is a bitch
I hear that life is a beast
Life is a freak on a leash
I got the mark of the beast

Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
I give 'em hell, won't wish 'em well
Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
I'm raising hell, send 'em to hell

Tortuously, killin' my infidels effortlessly
Want them to be my P-R-O-P-E-D-E-A-D
Dead 'em, I do it professionally
Assassin's Creed, your majesty
Your after is not happily
Her body in factories while others lean on tragedy
I'm that joke, say that's a Periscope
Fuck a telescope
Careful my angel a higher hope, I desire rope, uh
I'm gonna live by my confidence
I'm gonna die by my arrogance
Heaven and hell is irrelevant
I be the black metal terrorist

Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
I give 'em hell, won't wish 'em well
Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel
I'm raising hell, send 'em to hell

Jackal in a jack mood
(Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel)
Everything that I say will be taboo
(I give 'em hell, won't wish 'em well)
In a bad mood, but I'm back too
(Finish 'em, Zel, finish 'em, Zel)
Everything that I say will be taboo

(I'm raising hell)
(Send 'em to hell)
I be the black metal terrorist
I be the black metal terrorist
Send 'em to hell
