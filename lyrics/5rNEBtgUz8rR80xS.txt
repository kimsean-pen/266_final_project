Nights of blood and sweat behind
Dreams of stardom filled our minds
Friends that did not stand the fight
Hope they'll see us here tonight

The roar in your ears goes straight to your head
Filling your body with pleasure
You Start clapping your hands
You start singing along and we'll be
Rockin' the night awaaay
Rockiiiiiinnnn...

Hearts that broke along the way
Just the price we had to pay
Love did never strike us blind
Nights like this were in our minds

The roar in your ears goes straight to your head
Filling your body with pleasure
You Start clapping your hands
You start singing along and we'll be
Rockin' the night awaaay
Rockiiiiiinnnn...

Rockin!

You have justified the fight
Now we're standing in the light
Proves our aim was never wrong
See the music made us strong

The roar in your ears goes straight to your head
Filling your body with pleasure
You Start clapping your hands
You start singing along and we'll be
Rockin' the night awaaay
Rockiiiiiinnnn...
