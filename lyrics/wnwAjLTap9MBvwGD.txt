Lies
Volumes between you and yourself
A live one
Kneels down
And when he comes to find you
The saviour spares yours
And takes mine

Truth too sharp for your ears to hear
Rattled to pieces
Over and over

Kick over the statues
You've prayed away one million nights
Termites choke on a splinter
He saves yours and takes mine
Truth too sharp for your ears to hear
Rattled to pieces
Over and over

Thoughts not worth their salt
Once gold in the womb
An afterthought
Thoughts not worth their salt
There's gold in the womb
Thoughts not worth their salt
Once gold in the womb
An afterthought
There's gold in the womb
