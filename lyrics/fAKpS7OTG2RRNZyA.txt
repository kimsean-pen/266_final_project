Love to hate
repeating my mistakes
Now there's no one left to listen,
no one left to listen

Take a chance,
a f*cked up consequence,
When there's no one left to listen,
no one left to listen

Right now we're taking control
Tired of waiting,
tired of waiting for something new
Right now we're taking control
Tired of waiting,
tired of waiting for something new

Something new, something new, something new

Pressed the knife
and feed the sacrifice
When there's no one left to listen,
no one left to listen

Say goodbye,
you will die tonight
And now everyone will listen,
everyone will listen

Right now we're taking control
Tired of waiting,
tired of waiting for something new
Right now we're taking control
Tired of waiting,
tired of waiting for something new
something new, something new, something neeeew

Cause it's neeever enough to know the truth
When you lost all you know, there's nothing to lose

Right now!
we're taking control
Tired of waiting, tired of waiting for something new
Right now we're taking control
Tired of waiting, tired of waiting for something new
Right now we're taking control
Tired of waiting, tired of waiting for something new
something new, something new, something new
