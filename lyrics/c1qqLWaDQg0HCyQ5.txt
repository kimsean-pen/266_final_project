Not so long ago
I tried to make you love me
I told you that I loved you
Then asked you if you loved me
And although you said no
There's still something inside me
That trembles when I hear your name
You're still the only girl for me

And now
You still don't want to know
If you still don't want to know
Where does this leave me?
And now
He wants you to love him
If you say that you love him
Where does this leave me?
Where does this leave me?

I know I should forget
But I just can't forget you
I know it's all so pointless
But honestly I love you
Perhaps I should admit
That he'd be better for you
But I could never say that
Because it's simply not true

And now
You still don't want to know
If you still don't want to know
Where does this leave me?
And now
He wants you to love him
If you say that you love him
Where does this leave me?
Where does this leave me?
