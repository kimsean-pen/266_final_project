The funeral cars crawl down
The heartbreak side of town
The mourners all discuss
The boy who caused a fuss
We chopped a billion trees to print up eulogies
But guys we should have guessed
The girls would say it best
Moondog

Love, 'cos love's the final word
Nothing crosses love
Reason has to bow if love demands it

Moondog, guess who's on the moon
Moondog, guess who's on the moon
Up there a flag will fly for mom and apple pie
Moondog, guess who's on the moon
Moondog, guess who's on the moon
The one place left to play
The comeback's underway

The world was younger then
In bed asleep by ten
And daddies shook their fists
At hidden communists
The earth was merely round
Before the slap back sound
Is there one spell can bring
The once and future king?
Moondog

Cut to somewhere deep in space
Beyond the Colonel's arms
Handsome doggone rake the truly weightless

Moondog, guess who's on the moon
Moondog, guess who's on the moon
Up there a flag will fly, yes sir, for mom and apple pie
Moondog, guess who's on the moon
Moondog, guess who's on the moon
The one place left to play, hey
The comeback's underway

Moondog, guess who's on the moon
Moondog, guess who's on the moon
Up there a flag will fly, yes sir, for mom and apple pie
Moondog, guess who's on the moon
Moondog, guess who's on the moon
The one place left to play, hey
The comeback's underway
