Do you think I'm faking
When I'm lying next to you?
Do you think that I am blind?
There's nothing left for me to lose
Must be something on your mind
Something lost and left behind
Do you know I'm faking now?

Do you know I'm faking
When I'm lying next to you?
Do you know that I am blind
To everything you ever do?
Must be something on your mind
Something lost for me to find

Do you know I'm faking?
'Cos then she told me she had a gun
It sounded like she'd used it
Once before on him

Then she told me she had a gun
It sounded like she'd used it
Once before, oh, man
I guess you know I'm faking
When I tell you I love you
I guess you know that I am blind
To everything you say and do

Must be something on my mind
There's nothing left for me to hide
Do you know I'm faking?
'Cos then she told me she had a gun

It sounded like she'd used it
Once before on him
Then she told me she had a gun
It sounded like she'd used it
Once before, oh, man
We have to succumb to

The feelings we can never face
I need you, I breathe you
I can't go through this all again
We have to succumb to
The feelings we can never face
I need you, I breathe you
I can't go through this
'Cos then she told me she had a gun
It sounded like she'd used it
Once before
'Cos then she told me she had a gun
It sounded like she'd used it
Once before on him
Then she told me she had a gun
It sounded like she'd used it
Once before, oh, man
Then she told me she had a gun
She says she wants to use it
On me now
