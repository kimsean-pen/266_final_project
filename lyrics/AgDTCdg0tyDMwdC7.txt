The world is full of indisputables
(With whom all of us share reality)
The world is in fact just that
(A long indisputable and rich tradition)
The world I know of I'm extrusive
(To be jealous is to conform)
Not the only one
A nominal thing
The law of division
Jealousy will make you suffer
(From being excluded from the universal)
Jealousy will make you suffer
(From being "crazy from being a woman")
