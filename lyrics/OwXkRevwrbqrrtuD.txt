I just bought some drugs
Off a man I didn't know, in the lobby
The lobby of the Roosevelt
As if you didn't warn me enough

I got that Califormula
Got that Califormula
One more night
I got that Califormula

No use in thinking 'bout it now
Cuz you're gone

You're gone, you're gone
So I leave it all behind
I always feel like I'm behind you
I try to sleep but I
I'm faded out my mind
Lay me down tonight

I always feel like I'm beside you
I got that Califormula
Got that Califormula
One more night

I got that Califormula
Ooh ooh ooh
One more night
Got that Califormula
Thinking 'bout you now (you know you know)
But where are you
Where are you going
You're gone
You're gone
