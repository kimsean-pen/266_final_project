Cause everybody's gonna let you down

Self fornication, but with no hesitation

Got no faith in the human will

It's a lonely ride
Are you lonely right?

Cause what if I become like all this
Self fornication, but with no hesitation
I just burn all night, it's a lonely life
A lonely ride
Let me down easy
