I've got a stalk of sinsemilla
Growing in my back yard
I've got a stalk of sinsemilla
Growing in my back yard

Don't cut down the cali tree
Cause it makes the best tea for me
And the doctor says it gives naturally
One thing this doctor will need
A lot of food
To survive and go to in Babylon

Yes I've walked the streets and seen children down town
Begging everyone they see and it hurt me
It can't be right what this world do for the youth
And the little girl who am saying they want to capture me
I and I don't cherish wickedness
Because it's none profit to I and I

Anything that is none profit
I and I don't take for it
Pass it, pass it
All over I and I

There is a red house over yonder
Full of marijuana
I've been sitting on the corner
Chatting up with the farmer

Free the herb
Heal the nation
Heal the sick
