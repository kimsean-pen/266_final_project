You can walk, walk to the pasture
There's no house on Mercy Street
You might get lost in the company of angels
Ignoring the stones tied around your feet

Yeah you got to try for something
Bend your knee and fight for something
Learn how to die for something
So you ain't living life for nothing, no

Rivers weren't made for drowning
Souls are never made to fail
I raised Jericho around me
But these walls were built to stand

I framed a fortress 'round my heart
Carved her name in the old front door
So she would know love still stands
Here forever even when she's gone

Love can be a heat wave
Love can be a cold rain
Shadows that play
On the walls of your room

Rivers weren't made for drowning
Souls are never made to fail
I raised Jericho around me
But these walls were built to stand

Yeah you got to try for something
Bend your knee and fight for something
Learn how to die for something
So you ain't living life for nothing, no

Rivers weren't made for drowning
Souls are never made to fail
I raised Jericho around me
But these walls were built to stand

These walls were built to stand
These walls were built to stand
