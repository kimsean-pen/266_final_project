Phone keeps ringing in another room
I'm daydreaming like a little kid at school
Caffeine, thinking of my teenage youth
I'm alive, but I can barely move

I guess I've always been this way
It's been hard for me to say
Close my eyes, it'll go away

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

They've been telling me
To come of age
I've been going through
An awkward phase
Whoaaaaaa
Whoaaaaaa
They've been trying hard to wake me up
Saying stuff that never gets me off
Whoaaaaaa
Whoaaaaaa
Don't mind me
I'm living in another world (Living in another world)
Don't mind me
I'm living in another world (Living in another world)
Whoaaaaaa

TV's telling me to be myself
I can't trust what the neon psychic sells
So I found out how to trust myself
I found out I'm stronger than the pills

I guess I've always been this way
It's been hard for me to say
Close my eyes, take me away

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

They've been telling me
To come of age
I've been going through
An awkward phase
Whoaaaaaa
Whoaaaaaa
They've been trying hard to wake me up
Saying stuff that never gets me off
Whoaaaaaa
Whoaaaaaa
Don't mind me
I'm living in another world (Living in another world)
Don't mind me
I'm living in another world (Living in another world)
Whoaaaaaa

These are nights I feel I could die
Four chords and a beat keep me alive
You can barely recognize
Everything beyond my eyes
I've been going through it my whole life

These are nights I feel I could die
Four chords and a beat keep me alive
You can barely recognize
Everything beyond my eyes
I've been going through it my whole life

They've been telling me
To come of age
I've been going through
An awkward phase
Whoaaaaaa
Whoaaaaaa
They've been trying hard to wake me up
Saying stuff that never gets me off
Whoaaaaaa
Whoaaaaaa
Don't mind me
I'm living in another world (Living in another world)
Don't mind me
I'm living in another world (Living in another world)
Whoaaaaaa
Whoaaaaaa
