Your heart is as cold as ice girl
And i should know
I've been to the north pole
Your soul is as black as death girl
And i should know
I have crossed the threshold
Your style is such a mess girl
And i should know
I used to date a stylist

And still my heart sweats
(3x)

XOXOX
XOX
Some hearts bleed
Our hearts sweat
(4x)
