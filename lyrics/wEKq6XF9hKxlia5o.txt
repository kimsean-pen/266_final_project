All is well, you passed out of a thought so long ago
I sat across your other son and listened as he told me so
Howling into glacial lakes
Deafening in the wake
As your waking days unwind
But now the living are alive

Ooh alive alive alive alive
Ooh alive alive alive alive
Ooh alive alive alive alive
Ooh ooh ooh

I can recall a time before the longing to redeem
All would be forgiven by your daughter and me
Yet not all of us will be

Ooh alive alive alive alive
Ooh alive alive alive alive
Ooh alive alive alive alive
Ooh ooh ooh
