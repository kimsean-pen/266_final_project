I lay my eyes in the past
From the first day to the last
Several things we had to learn
Countless mistakes from times of yore

Now we restart, we recreate
Your present is your fate

Don't turn your backs on mankind
Only yourselves you wanna save
Ignorance burns just like a fire
Consuming people on its flame

Fellow creatures, so wonderful!
So different and so grand

Sprouts of time
The roots evolving
The seeds for the future were scattered yesterday
Tomorrow's harvest field we plant today
Your crown will ever last
The tall trees of life

(Life experience) Break your shell reach the light!
(Mind and soul) Find your path to the skies
(Will come around on a thunder sound)
Raging with power and fury the new born world

Sprouts of time
The roots evolving
The seeds from the past branching out
Growing forever
Hands on heart
Embrace each other
The dances, the faces, the smiles behind the past

New seasons bring the chance to start again
Tall trees will ever last
The circles of life
