There's a world passed the curtains of eager excitement
A sea of impatience, awaiting incitement
It's all so enticing, it's so mesmerizing
It's so hypnotizing, the rhythmic beguiling

Bring the house down
Breathe in, out, in, out, in, out

When the lights come on, when the crowd goes wild
Rip the roof up off of here, take it to the stratosphere, to the stratosphere
Stand up and scream it loud when the fireflies
Rip the roof up off of here, take it to the stratosphere, to the stratosphere

After sitting and waiting and anticipating
The energy through the walls reverberating
It's so captivating, the buzz generated
It's invigorating, I feel elevated

Bring the house down
Breathe in, out, in, out, in, out

When the lights come on, when the crowd goes wild
Rip the roof up off of here, take it to the stratosphere, to the stratosphere
Stand up and scream it loud when the fireflies
Rip the roof up off of here, take it to the stratosphere, to the stratosphere

When the lights come on, when the crowd goes wild
Rip the roof up off of here, take it to the stratosphere, to the stratosphere
Stand up and scream it loud, when the fireflies
Rip the roof up off of here, take it to the stratosphere, to the stratosphere

To the stratosphere
