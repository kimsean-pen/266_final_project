Say a prayer now
Don't be scared now
You don't want trouble
We might get some
We might get some
It's troublesome
But don't you worry
You can help me

Killing lies
Killing lies

Killing lies
Killing lies
First you're worried
Then you're hurried
Don't think that everything is gonna stay the same
That's impossible
Before I let you go
Let me look at you
Don't you worry

You will help me
Killing lies

Killing lies
Killing lies
Killing lies
Oh yes I know you're still
Oh yes I notice you
You are a friend of mine
You are a friend of mine
