We put the hearts before the cause
Got so high, we burned the paper on
All your premonitions, of our condition
Came true

Cause everything you do you do for you

The milk inside the fridge
It turned
The bridge between us
It burned
You're always fishing
And wishing I was someone
Brand new

Cause everything you do you do for you

I'm barely here
I'm barely there
Expect me home
Any day
Now real soon

I'm reelin'
Feelin' by the wasted
I want to give up and hide out in the basement
You schooled the competition and now my tuition
Is due

Cause everything you do you do for you
