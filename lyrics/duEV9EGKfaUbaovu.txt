Half the brain renames itself "Remote Tumor Seeker"
After it viewed the timeless drip.

Manipulating hemispheric dominance.
Educated by injecting neo neural integrators
Proved to work in making half the brain comply.
After activating vision it began the seeker killing.

A.U.M. documents the project
By implanting nano cameras in it's iris.
Live feed of the kills projects
On a massive screen of flesh behind a liquid
Looming black endless grotesque.
This drip, that invites itself.
Cautiously out from the ceilings center.
Elder than mankind's frail lineage.

Eating it's way down through my spine.
Replace and conquer.
Releasing it's ungodly ether into me.

Always keeping to one half and often having
A fetal-like tantrum under one eye;
Adding claim to my delusion of a living tumor growing in me.
It can look into you as you look into me looking for it.
Over riding half my body and my brain.
Though it came from me, it calls to you to come and cut it out.

Rapidly taking over my right hemisphere.

Allocating left to be the prey and right to be the hunter
Unknowingly, both documents for the A.U.M.

I share my eyes with the seeker,
Investigating endless mile.
His trail built of barren heads.
His boundless quest ensures he'll kill
Until he is the last one left.

I watch him grin, shake the hand of the victim
Then frantically ransack each one of their skulls.
