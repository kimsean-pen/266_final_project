To be conscious and to criticize is your animal right
But to pigeonhole and pry is to die in my eyes
When you are so far from the ground that we are nowhere in sight
How can you be the one to dissect? The one to decide?
I've waited at the door
I've waited too long
To disconnect from the dream. To take your throat and force reality.
But now you've stepped too far. Now you've crossed the line
Now you are finally inside

My world.
