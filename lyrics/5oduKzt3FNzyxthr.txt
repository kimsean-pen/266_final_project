Hey

Hey
Do you hear
Do you hear that sound
It's the sound of the lost gone found
It's the sound of a mute gone loud
It's the sound of a new start

Kiss
With a mouth of shooting stars
All the lost and the broken parts
Unafraid you can name your scars
With a touch of a new heart

It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
Ladeedadadadada, dadadadada
Oh, now is the start

Go
And it goes with where you go
The most faithful of friends, you don't
Need to think, you already know
You are right as you are

And it sounds like
(It sounds like)
It sounds like
(It sounds like)
Oh, it sounds like
Ladeedadadadada, dadadadada
Ladeedadadadada, dadadadada
Now oh
Now is that start
Oh now is the start

Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

New start
In the air there is a
New heart
Under there, beneath these
New arms, everywhere it is a
New, new, new, new start

It sounds like
(It sounds like)
Oh, it sounds like
(It sounds like)
Oh, it sounds like
Ladeedadadadada, dadadadada
Now
Ladeedadadadada, dadadadada
Now
Oh, now is the start
Oh, now is the start

It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
