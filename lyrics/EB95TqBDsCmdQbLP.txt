I can catch a kicker, kickup
I've got a candy gun
Kick a checker, set up
Keep out, the careful cats

Can I wake a sweeper, setoff?
I've got a candy gun
Make a wish that you give up
I love to hear some noise

Like a cracker, rather a blaster, I can laugh out
With a heeler, better beater, I just feel like shit
I see posers more like liars out there, hiding something good or bad?
But I don't care 'cause I've got my candy gun

Check out, it's me; check out, it's you
Pick up the flashpoint - Mess up! So what?
Here are my candies in my pocket
Won't you try some? They are so sweet like hell

I guess I need no see, no hear to be wise
I break myself so hard, so what? I hate it!
Head or tail, what is clear, what you think, maybe cheat, maybe not
And you loose your eyes
I've been thinking about it for 200 years
Can you take a spell?

Check a healer set, let a scissor cut
I can keep myself sane because I've got my candy gun!

Check out, it's me; check out, it's you
Pick up the flashpoint - Mess up! So what?
Here are my candies in my pocket
Won't you try some? They are so sweet like hell

I can shoot the gun
With a candy gun
I can shoot the gun
With a candy gun
