We hit a wall
That we put on
If you didn't know
Had control
It would mean some
But we put on
If we didn't know
It was so cold
It would never work

Have you seen the wall?
Have you seen the wall?
Have you seen the wall?
Have you seen the wall?

We hit a wall
That we put on
If you didn't know
Had control
It would be tall never tall
Said we pout a wall
Kiss me slow
Not deep
Soon had loved
Soon had love
Soon had love
And in this love

Have you seen the wall?
Have you seen the wall?
Have you seen the wall?
Have you seen the wall?
