You say I'm a fool,
You say I'm the one past
What does that mean
I think you're like drea, to me
Why? To me
Why? To me

Lay my cards on the table
Tell me my future
Tell me I'll make it
A hat trick, you've got the right eyes
Tell me my future, don't tell me lies

Don't show me the stars
Show me the distance
Show me who you are
Show me who you are

Lay my cards on the table
Tell me my future
Tell me I'll make it
A hat trick, you've got the right eyes
Tell me my future, don't tell me lies

Lay my cards on the table
Tell me my future
Tell me I'll make it
A hat trick, you've got the right eyes
Tell me my future

Now that I know you make it stop
Never let you go, never let you go
Never let you go, whoa.
