Here's a true story, said someone to me yesterday
Said he'd heard it in a taxi
Must have had him at my mercy
Drown that poor thing
Put it out of its misery
Condemn it to its future
Deny its history
Deny its history

So where are we going?
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going?
We're not ready for drowning

Look through my Venetian blinds
Dusting the past off my mind
Seeing orange everywhere
I'd go to Patagonia, but it's harder there
I'll do anything to prove I care
Fascinated by good
Destroyed by evil
What is there to believe in?

So where are we going?
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going?
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going?
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going?
We are not waving, we are drowning
