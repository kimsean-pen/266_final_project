In a church, by the face
He talks about the people goin' under

Only child know

A man decides after seventy years
That what he goes there for is to unlock the door
While those around him criticize and sleep

And through a fractal on a breaking wall
I see you my friend and touch your face again
Miracles will happen as we trip

But we're never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy
No, we're never gonna survive unless we are a little crazy

Yellow people walkin' through my head
One of them's got a gun, to shoot the other one
And yet together they were friends at school
(Ohh, get it, get it, get it, get it, no, no)

If all were there when we first took the pill
Then maybe, then maybe, then maybe, then maybe
Miracles will happen as we speak

But we're never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy
No, we're never gonna survive unless we are a little crazy
No no, never survive, unless we get a little bit

A man decides to go along after seventy years

Oh darlin', in a sky full of people, only some want to fly, isn't that crazy?

In a world full of people, only some want to fly, isn't that crazy, crazy?
In a heaven of people there's only some want to fly, ain't that crazy?
Oh babe (oh darlin'), in a world full of people
There's only some want to fly, isn't that crazy?
(Isn't that crazy?, isn't that crazy?, isn't that crazy?)

Ohh, but we're never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy
No, we're never gonna to survive unless we are a little crazy
But we're never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy
No, we're never gonna to survive unless we are a little crazy
No, no, never survive unless we get a little bit

And then you see things
The size of which you've never known before
They'll break it
Someday
Only child know
Them things
The size
Of which you've never known before
Someday...
