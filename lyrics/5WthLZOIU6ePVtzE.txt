Slow, slow
Slow as you can go
So I can feel all I want to know
Slow, slow
I go with your flow

Let the world keep it's carnival pace
I'd prefer to look into your beautiful face
What a waste

And the starts continue to fly by
I don't have one desire to understand why
I don't try

Slow, slow
Slow as you can go
I want my sense to overflow
Slow, slow
It doesn't show

I don't need a race in my bed
When speed's in my heart and speed's in my head
Instead

It's tempting for fools to rush in
When something's so good why should we rush and fail?
It's the same

Slow, slow
Slow as you can go
That's how I like it
I like it

I don't need a race in my bed
When speed's in my heart and speed's in my head
Instead

Slow, slow
Slow as you can go
That's how I like it
I like it

That's how I like it
That's how I like it
