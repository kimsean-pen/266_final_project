I could be faithful, honest and true
Holding my heart for you
Dependable all down the line
Devoted all the time

But if you want wasted, loaded, permanently folded
Doing the best that he can
I'm your man
I'm your man

Hold on all down the line
Faithful all the time
I'm waiting for a sign from you
I could be honest, constant and true

But if you want wasted, faded, uneducated
Doing the best that he can
I'm your man
I'm your man

I could be faithful, honest and true
Holding my heart for you
Faithful all down the line
Devoted all the time

But if you want wasted, faded, uneducated
Doing the best that he can
I'm your man
I'm your man
I'm your man
I'm your man
