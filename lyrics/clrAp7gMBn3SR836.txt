Wide eyes
Dark skies
Something's screaming inside
So free fall
Into the night storm
Face your demons tonight

Oh there is no way to hide it
Now all the blood and pressures rising

I can feel the thunder
Running through my veins
Running through my veins
I can feel the thunder
Tonight
Tonight
When darkness strikes
And all the hearts ignite
I can feel the thunder
Running through my veins
I'm the heart of the hurricane

Dark stars
Burning hearts
You're not alone
In this fight
Just breathe in
Your electric skin
Will explode into life

Oh you know that there's no way to hide it
Now all the blood and pressures rising

I can feel the thunder
Running through my veins
Running through my veins
I can feel the thunder
Tonight
Tonight
When darkness strikes
And all the hearts ignite
I can feel the thunder
Running through my veins
I'm the heart of the hurricane

Follow me
Rescue me
Come with me to never let me go
Melting minds
Instinctively
United in the center of the storm

I can feel the thunder
Running through my veins
I can feel the thunder
Tonight

When darkness strikes
And all the hearts ignite
I can feel the thunder
Running through my veins
I'm the heart of the hurricane
