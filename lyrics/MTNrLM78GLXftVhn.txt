Wake me up

Your world is turning upside down
Practice what you preach
A thousand words don't count
Don't be afraid to fail
Be amongst the few, the few who dare

Deal with the devil coming in, coming out
Your fear and despair, whatever it may take
(Woah)
You think I'm shaking by saying
(Woah)
Before later becomes never

When you're motionless inside
You don't even feel your time
So wake up and realize
Before later becomes never again

Don't be a poor spirit with a dead heart
Accept your scars, accept your past
Without desire to change
Tomorrow will be the same
Be amongst the few, the few who dare

Deal with the devil coming in, coming out
Your fear and despair, whatever it may take
(Woah)
You think I'm shaking by saying
(Woah)
Before later becomes never

Deal with the devil
Deal with the devil
(Woah)
You think I'm shaking by saying
(Woah)
Before later becomes never

When you're motionless inside
You don't even feel your time
So wake up and realize
Before later becomes never again

Wake me up
Wake me up

My eyes are shut
I can't take it any longer
I am trapped, another time
With the weight on my shoulders

Wake me up
Wake me up
Before later becomes never
Wake me up
Wake me up
Before later becomes never

When you're motionless inside
You don't even feel your time
So wake up and realize
Before later becomes never again
So wake up and realize
Before later becomes never again
