I, I can't get enough
This means way too much
I will never
I can never
I won't ever
Stop
Pushing me around
Open up the ground
Will you ever
Can you ever
See you've...

Made a mistake
Made a mistake
Didn't choose to have left me dead
Made a mistake
Made a mistake
You should've left me dead

Crushed
Painful as it sounds
Motors tightly wound
Pull the covers
Pull my covers
To uncover
Lust
Deadly when she frowns
Silent in the crowd
Will she ever
Can she ever
See you've...

Made a mistake
Made a mistake
Didn't choose to have left me dead
Made a mistake
Made a mistake
You should've left me dead

I can hardly stand that you aren't mine
I can hardly stand that you aren't mine
I can hardly stand this
Try to understand it
Gave you all I had when you were mine

Made a mistake
Made a mistake
Didn't you left me dead
Made a mistake
Made a mistake
You should've left me, should've left me dead

Made a mistake
Made a mistake
Didn't choose to have left me dead
Made a mistake
Made a mistake
You should've left me dead

Made a mistake
Made a mistake
Didn't choose to have left me dead
Made a mistake
Made a mistake
You should've left me, should've left me dead
(I could never, trust another)
You should've left me dead
(I could never, trust another)
You should've left me dead
(I could never, trust another)
You should've left me dead
(I could never...)
You should've left me, should've left me dead
