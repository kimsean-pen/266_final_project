Infected by invalid behavior
While capturing the stench of divine putrefaction
Confess to slavery for the world savior
Give praise and inhale the corruption

The enfeebled provides the fool
The disabled provides the tool
The apathetic demands the affection
To those suffering from their own satisfaction

Devour in self-deceit
Conjure the righteous plague
Testify today's contradiction
Glorify tomorrows deed

Inconceivable moral priest
Hide in preferable dress
Invite to another pleasure feast
The concealment of joyful laughter

The enfeebled provides the fool
The disabled provides the tool
The apathetic demands the affection
To those suffering from their own satisfaction

The decrepit innocence of your correctness
And well-chosen
Elicits the source of the need

For immediate forgiveness
Submit to no grace
But the spiteful of your disease

Apply to join the unlimited disgrace
And a settlement in the skies
And turn the confusion

Among your children into self-stimulation
The incarnation of your prostitution
The true evil in disguise

With the ignorance
From your cross as the witness
The truth of your tragedy make you justice
In your mirror the high spirit of kindness
Looks like malice

Condemnation of life by the living dead
What a premature judgment
Contradiction to the core
How unfortunate I am

Cursed to spend time
On a battle already won
The shame that will be guarding
Your grave says it all

Retreat to the crypt
And make it worthwhile
Recall my sins furthermore
But still be watching yours with a smile

Devour in self-deceit
Conjure the righteous plague
Testify today's contradiction
Glorify tomorrows deed
