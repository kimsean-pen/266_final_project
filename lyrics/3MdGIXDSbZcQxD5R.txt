He's a demagogue
Check out his rise
He's a demagogue
He's fatally famous
He's a demagogue
He plays with my fears
A demagogue
My shadow side dreaming
The demagogue
It feels so good to be dumb

From the wall straight to la cuenta
Those pussy grabbing fingers
Won't let go of me now
Demagogue
The demagogue

He's a demagogue
He'd like to punch in your face
He's a demagogue
Throwing terminal shade
The demagogue
He knows all of the words
He's a demagogue
He sees a nation of marks

From the mob to chapter eleven
Those tiny vulgar fingers
On the nuclear bomb
Demagogue
The demagogue
