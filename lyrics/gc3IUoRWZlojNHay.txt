To live between a rock
And a hard place
In between time --
Cruising in prime time --
Soaking up the cathode rays

To live between the wars
In our time --
Living in real time --
Holding the good time --
Holding on to yesterdays...

You know how that rabbit feels
Going under your speeding wheels
Bright images flashing by
Like windshields towards a fly
Frozen in the fatal climb --
But the wheels of time --
Just pass you by...

Wheels can take you around
Wheels can cut you down

We can go from boom to bust
From dreams to a bowl of dust
We can fall from rockets' red glare
Down to "Brother can you spare --"
Another war -- another waste land --
And another lost generation...

It slips between your hands
Like water
This living in real time
A dizzying lifetime
Reeling by on celluloid

Struck between the eyes
By the big-time world
Walking uneasy streets --
Hiding beneath the sheets --
Got to try and fill the void...

You know how that rabbit feels
Going under your speeding wheels
Bright images flashing by
Like windshields towards a fly
Frozen in the fatal climb --
But the wheels of time --
Just pass you by...

We can go from boom to bust
From dreams to a bowl of dust
We can fall from rockets' red glare
Down to "Brother can you spare --"
Another war -- another waste land --
And another lost generation...

Wheels can take you around
Wheels can cut you down

Fall from rockets' red glare
Down to "Brother can you spare --"
Another war -- another waste land --
Another lost generation...
