Who would've known
In the link of a moment
The world turned upside down
Trying to cope, I'm
Looking for hope
And I think about

Ooh, what's come of us?
Ooh, it's all too much

I feel so small
With my hands up to the sky
I am reaching out tonight
'Cause this is bigger than us
I give my all
But it's just too much to hope
No I can't do this alone
'Cause this is bigger than us
Bigger than us

It's like everything changes
Still nothing change
We arrive and we begin
Running in circles
Searching for purpose
With an open hand

Ooh, what's come of us?
Ooh, it's all too much

I feel so small
With my hands up to the sky
I am reaching out tonight
'Cause this is bigger than us
I give my all
But it's just too much to hope
No I can't do this alone
'Cause this is bigger than us
Bigger than us

And we lose ourselves in battles we are fighting
Gotta break away

I feel so small
With my hands up to the sky
I am reaching out tonight
'Cause this is bigger than us
I give my all
But it's just too much to hope
No I can't do this alone
'Cause this is bigger than us
Bigger than us
