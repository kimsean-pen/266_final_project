Mon Cour, Encore
Mon Cour, Encore

(VERSE 1)
Don't wanna be alone I wanna be together
On the loop
Don't wanna be alone I wanna be together
When the trouble's over
Don't wanna be alone I wanna be together
On the loop
Love unfolds
Givin' you all my heart again

Mon Cour, Encore

(CHORUS)
This love is dangerous
Givin' you all my heart again
This love is dangerous
Givin' you all my heart again
On the loop

(VERSE 2)
Gotta tell me now babe if it's now or never
On the loop
I wanna hang around but I can't wait forever
You're gonna take me over, yeah
C'mon and tell me if it's now or never
On the loop
Love unfolds
Givin' you all

Mon Coure, Encore

(repeat CHORUS)

This love is dangerous
Can't stop thinkin' of ya
Can't stop thinkin' of ya
This love is dangerous

(VERSE 3)
Don't wanna be alone I wanna be together
On the loop
Don't wanna be alone I wanna...
Oh when the trouble's over, yeah
Do you wanna come around
I'm where you left me baby
On the loop
Love unfolds
Givin' you all my heart again
Mon Cour

This love is dangerous
Dig ya baby, dig ya baby
This love is dangerous
On the loop

Just be together
Just be together
On the loop
Just be
Be together, be together, be together
Dig ya baby, dig ya baby
On the loop
