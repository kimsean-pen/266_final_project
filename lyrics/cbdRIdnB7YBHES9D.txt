Load the car and write the note
Grab your bag and grab your coat
Tell the ones that need to know
We are headed north

One foot in and one foot back
But it don't pay to live like that
So I cut the ties and I jumped the tracks
For never to return

Oh, Brooklyn, Brooklyn, take me in
Are you aware the shape I'm in?
My hands they shake, my head it spins
Oh, Brooklyn, Brooklyn, take me in

When at first I learned to speak
I used all my words to fight
With him and her and you and me
Ah, but it's just a waste of time
Yeah, it's such a waste of time

That woman she's got eyes that shine
Like a pair of stolen polished dimes
She asked to dance, I said it's fine
I'll see you in the morning time

Oh, Brooklyn, Brooklyn, take me in
Are you aware the shape I'm in?
My hands they shake, my head it spins
Oh, Brooklyn, Brooklyn, take me in

Three words that became hard to say
I and Love and You
What you were than I am today
Look at the things I do

Ah, Brooklyn, Brooklyn, take me in
Are you aware the shape I'm in?
My hands they shake, my head it spins
Ah, Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in

Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in
Are you aware the shape I'm in
My hands they shake, my head it spins, (spins)
Ah, Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in
Dumbed-down and numbed by time and age
Your dreams they catch the world a cage
The highway sets the travelers stage
All exits look the same
Three words that became hard to say
I and Love and You
I and Love and You
I and Love and You
