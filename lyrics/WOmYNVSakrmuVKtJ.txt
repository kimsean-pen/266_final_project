And I met the seventh son
He came for everyone
The day he heard the lightning in the field

I've heard him clear his throat
A fork within the road
That night the tallahatchie took the wheel

I've been throwing knives to see just where they'll land
Now my world is in your hands

Send in the congregation
Open your eyes, step in the light
A jukebox generation
Just as you were

The voice upon the stage
Is a heart inside a cage
And it's singing like bluebird in the round

There's mystery in this wood
And ghosts within these roots
And a tangle deep beneath this southern ground

I've been going through life making foolish plans
Now my world is in your hands

Send in the congregation
Open your eyes, step in the lights
A jukebox generation
Just as you were

Just as you were
Just as you were

And you need blind faith
No false hope
No false hope

Do you have blind faith?
No false hope
No false hope

Where is your blind faith?
No false hope
No false hope

Open your eyes
Open your eyes
Step into the light!

Open your eyes
Step into the light!

The sound becomes
Congregation
A congregation
A congregation

And there

In the singing like a blue bird in the round
