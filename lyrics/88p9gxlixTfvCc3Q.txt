I got a girl she likes classical
She likes Beethoven and don't we all
I've tried to tell her to teach her
to turn her on to Rossini
With a bang and a boom
and catchy little tune by Rossini
We're music lovers well that's what they say
But we're different in many ways
Now there's Nigel, he likes classical
He plays the fiddle and don't we all
I've tried to tell him to teach him
to turn him on to Rossini
