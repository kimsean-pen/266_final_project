If you want to run with me
I will show you how
Beams of love are holding me
Let me feel your power

If you want to suffer me
I will show you how
Share a secret, you and me
Come and get a smile

We're so high
I'm so high
I'm so high

Taste of?
I will show you how
Wish I would have dreamed of you
It's all over now

Bubblegum and ecstasy
Make me feel the power
If you want to run with me
I will show you how

I'm so high
I'm so high
I'm so high

I'm so high
I'm so high
I'm so high
I'm so high
