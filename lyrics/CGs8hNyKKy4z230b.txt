I know that when you look at me
There's so much that you juat don't see
But if you could only took the time
I know in my heart you would find
A girl who's scared sometimes
Who isn't always strong
Can't you see the hurt in me?
I feel so alone
I wanna run to you
(oooh)
I wanna run to you
(oooh)
Won't you hold me in your arms?
And keep me safe from harm
I wanna run to you
(oooh)
But if i come to you
(oooh)
Tell me, will you stay or will you run away

Each day, each day i play the rolee
Of someone always in control
But at night i come home and turn the key
There's nobody here, no ome cares for me
What's the sense of trying hard to find your dreams
Without someone to share it with
Tell me what does it mean?
I need you here
I meed you here to wipe away my tears
To kiss away my fears
If you only knew how much
