Sometimes she steals my car just to start a fight
Throws my phone in the pool and smiles
That's fine we don't sleep
We make love all night
She might be trouble but she's still mine

(ooooooh)
She loves me
She hates me

(ooooooh)
She's my kind of crazy
Monday morning fall in love and then
Tuesday she wishes I were dead
Wednesday make-up
Thursday break up
All over and over again
Friday night she hits on all my friends
Saturday we're making-out again
Sunday I'll ask her to marry me

Seven days of her just makes me weak
(ooooooh)
Seven days of her just makes me weak
(ooooooh)
Sometimes she breaks the strings on my new guitar

Max out all my credit cards
But it's all right
It don't make sense we made it this far

But I love us just the way we are
(ooooooh)
She loves me
She hates me
(ooooooh)
She's my kind of crazy
Monday morning fall in love and then
Tuesday she wishes I were dead
Wednesday make-up
Thursday break up

All over and over again
Friday night she hits on all my friends
Saturday we're making-out again
Sunday I'll ask her to marry me
Seven days of her just makes me weak
(ooooooh)

Seven days of her just makes me weak
(ooooooh)
Back and forth
Round and Round
Left to Right
Up and Down

She's my kind, my my kind
She's my kind of crazy
Back and forth

Round and Round
Left to Right
Up and Down
She's my kind, my my kind
She's my kind of crazy
(ooooooh)
She loves me
She hates me
(ooooooh)
She's my kind of crazy

Monday morning fall in love and then
Tuesday she wishes I were dead
Wednesday make-up
Thursday break up
All over and over again
Friday night she hits on all my friends
Saturday we're making-out again
Sunday I'll ask her to marry me
Seven days of her just makes me weak
(ooooooh)
Seven days of her just makes me weak
(ooooooh)
Seven days of her just makes me weak
