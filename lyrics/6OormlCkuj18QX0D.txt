The smell of cold, scent of the rain
Always that lingering feeling
I will see you again
My dreams are like torture
Every night the same
You running away from me
Like some kind of game
Alone I am standing in a crowded place
When over in the distance, I see your face

Come back

Dreams are all we have together now
So why do you run from me?
It's getting hard to bear when I'm awake

In a frantic panic, I slip through the swelling mass
Why must you run from me, every time this dream so crass
You said we'd be together till the bitter end
Remember our sacred pact?
That promise you did not defend
