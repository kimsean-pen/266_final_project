Daydream
I fell asleep amid the flowers
For a couple of hours on a beautiful day

Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours, such a beautiful day

I dream a dirty dream of you baby
You're crawling on the bathroom floor
You float around the room and you're naked
Then you're flying out the bedroom door
I dream a dirty dream

I dream a dirty dream

Daydream
I fell asleep amid the flowers
For a couple of hours, on a beautiful day
Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours, such a beautiful day.

I dream a dirty dream of you baby
You're swinging from the chandelier
I'm climbing up the walls 'cause i want you
But when I reach you, you disappear
I dream a dirty dream

I dream a dirty dream

I dirty dream
I dirty dream
I dirty dream
Dream

Daydream
I fell asleep amid the flowers
For a couple of hours, on a beautiful day

Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours, such a beautiful day

Daydream
I fell asleep amid the flowers
For a couple of hours, on a beautiful day

Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours, such a beautiful day
