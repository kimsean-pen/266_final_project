Twistin' and Groovin' - Leon Bridges
I got a call from my baby said she fed up with me
Said she's found another lover in another city
Said she's doing fine in New Orleans
Now she got me pacing huh
Wondering where'd I go wrong
Got me going in circles like the merry-go-round
Gonna take the west train to Louisiana in the morning
Sweet little girl from the ninth ward of New Orleans
The way she dancing you could see her from Tennessee
Up under that red dress are legs long as the bayou trees
She got a golden smile
I know she's the one for me in the room
She's a-twistin' and a-groovin'
Shakin' and a-movin'
She don't know what she doin' to me I
Love the way that you dance and honey
I've got a question
Baby would you be my queen
All right now
Her name was Eartha was her name
I could never forget
Just like the way she dipped on the bronze-tiled floor
Honey was movin' with ease each and every step
So good that baby had my eyes at her glow
No shiny jewelry
Still the brightest thing illuminatin' the room
That girl is twistin' and a-groovin'
Shakin' and a-movin'
She don't know what she doin' to me I
Love the way that you dance and honey
I've got a question:
Baby would you be my queen
Ooh ooh baby
Ooh ooh baby
Ooh ooh baby
Ooh that baby got a golden smile
I know she's the one for me in that room
That girl is a-twistin' and a-groovin'
Shakin' and a-movin'
She don't know what she doin' to me I
Love the way that you dance and honey
I've got a question:
Baby would you be my queen
Ooh ooh baby
Ooh ooh baby
Ooh ooh baby
Mmm that baby got a golden smile
I know she's the one for me in that room
