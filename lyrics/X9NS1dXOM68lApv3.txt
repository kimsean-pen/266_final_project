Nice legs, Daisy Dukes
Makes a man go,
That's the way they all come through like,
Low-cut, see-through shirts that make ya,
That's the way she come through like

'Cause I just set them up,
Just set them up,
Just set them up tonight (to knock them down),
'Cause I just set them up,
Just set them up,
Just set them up tonight,
to knock them down

I think I should know how
to make love to something innocent without leaving my fingerprints
Out,
Now,
L-o-v-e's just another word I never learned to pronounce,
How do I say I'm sorry 'cause the word is never gonna come out,
Now,
L-o-v-e's just another word I never learned to pronounce

Tight jeans, double D's makin' me go,
All the people on the street know,
Iced out, lit-up make the kids go,
All the people on the street know

'Cause I just set them up,
Just set them up,
'Cause I just set them up,
Just set them up,
Just set them up tonight,
to knock them down

I think I should know how
to make love to something innocent without leaving my fingerprints
Out,
Now,
L-o-v-e's just another word I never learned to pronounce,
How do I say I'm sorry 'cause the word is never gonna come out,
Now,
L-o-v-e's just another word I never learned to pronounce

You know that type of shit
Just don't work on me
Listen, no trying to flirt with me
Don't take this personally
Cuz we were never in love
It doesn't really matter who you say you are
Singing out the window of your car
Find another girl across the bar
Cuz L-O-V-E's not what this was

I think I should know how
to make love to something innocent without leaving my fingerprints
Out,
Now,
L-o-v-e's just another word I never learned to pronounce,
How do I say I'm sorry 'cause the word is never gonna come out,
Now,
L-o-v-e's just another word I never learned to pronounce
