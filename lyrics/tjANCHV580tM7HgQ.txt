Isn't this such a beautiful night,
Whoa, we're underneath a thousand shining stars.
Isn't it nice to find yourself somewhere different,
Whoa, why don't you let yourself just be wherever you are.
Look at this place, look at your faces.
I've never seen you look like this before.

Isn't it nice to find yourself somewhere different,

Whoa, why don't you let yourself just be wherever you are.

Look at this place, look at your faces.
They're shining like a thousand shining stars

Isn't it nice to find yourself somewhere different,
Whoa, why don't you let yourself just be wherever you are.
Why don't you let yourself just be somewhere different.
Whoa, why don't you let yourself just be wherever you are.
