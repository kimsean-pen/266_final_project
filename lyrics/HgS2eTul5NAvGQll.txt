Birdsong with bluebells under your feet
Doves fall asleep in the garden of beasts
Poisons in the mud of men
Hatching out once again

Gates are wide open, they beckon you in
Twisted road, let the games begin
Fugitives bound on a wheel of fire
Lucifer's lighthouse, flames for hire

Journeys of the damned sail through
Underneath a merciless moon
Gathering clouds, scream of the gale
Wrecked on the rocks of the daily wail
