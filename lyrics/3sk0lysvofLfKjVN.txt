It could take a little
It could take a little time
But I think we'll get it right
If this life is only
Only real when it hurts
But I think that we'll survive
Survive

We've built palaces
Imagining everything we want but can't have
Real life ain't so fantastic
What do you mean we could have had everything?
And now that this dream's palaces deceiving
We could have it all without the price that we paid
We could have it all without the shames
The palaces made

Break free from the chains
Break free from the chains
Into love
Into loveless
Break free from the chains
Break free from the chains
Into love

It could take a little
It could take a little
But this life could be so blessed
If we keep it simple
Say no to the madness
And take care of the rest, the rest

We've built palaces
Imagining everything we want but can't have
Real life ain't so fantastic
What do you mean we could have had everything?
And now that this dream's palaces deceiving

Break free from the chains
Break free from the chains
Into love
Into loveless
Break free from the chains
Break free from the chains
Into love

We built palaces but palaces fade
But we still say
We've built palaces
Imagining everything we want but can't have
Real life ain't so fantastic

Break free from the chains
Break free from the chains
Into love
Into loveless
Break free from the chains
Break free from the chains
Into love
Into loveless
Break free from the chains
Break free from the chains
Into love
Into loveless
Break free from the chains
Break free from the chains
Into love
Into love
