People used to tell me
That I could buy and sell me
There's no such thing as luck
Well, hey, OK
Then how do you explain
How things have changed so much

In the autumn leaves
High on LSD
Here comes the campus security
To take that away from me
Wanna see for myself
I wanna see what it means
But I can't because I'm stuck in a reversing machine

People used to tell me

There's no such thing as luck
Well, hey, OK
