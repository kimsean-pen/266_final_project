You never said, you never said, you never said
That it would be this hard
Love was meant to be forever, now or never
Seems too discard
There's gotta be a better way for me to say

What's on my heart without leaving scars
So can you hear me
When I call your name
And when you fall apart
Am I the reason for your endless sorrow

There's so much to be said
And with a broken heart
Your walls can only go down but so low
Can you hear me
When I call your name
When I call your name

Complicated situations are the makings of all that's wrong
And I've been standin' in the river of deliverance way too long
There's gotta be a better way for me to say
What's on my heart without leaving scars

So can you hear me
When I call your name
So can you hear me
When I call your name

And when you fall apart
Am I the reason for your endless sorrow
There's so much to be said
And with a broken heart

Your walls can only go down but so low
Can you hear me
When I call your name
You never said, you never said, you never said, you never said
When I call your name
You never said, you never said, you never said, you never said
When I call your name
Yeah
And when you fall apart
Am I the reason for your endless sorrow
There's so much to be said
And with a broken heart
Your walls can only go down but so low
Can you hear me
When I call your name
And when you fall apart
Am I the reason for your endless sorrow
There's so much to be said
And with a broken heart
Your walls can only go down but so low
Can you hear me
When I call your name
