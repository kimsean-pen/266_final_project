By the time I bought a ladder
I lost my mind, I was tripping
When you getting better?
It's a jagged line
Nothing lasts forever when you travel time
I've been sipping that cool aid at the cosmos

Cause the voyager's in every boy and girl
If you want to get to heaven, get out of this world
The voyager's in every boy and girl

When it finally hit me, I did not cry
Cause I was at the 7Eleven, flipping through the New York Times
I saw the printed in black and white
The voyager goes up in smoke

The voyager's in every boy and girl
If you want to get to heaven, get out of this world
You're the voyager
You're the voyager

You scared me straight, right into your arms
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh

The voyager's in every boy and girl
If you want to get to heaven, get out of this world
You're the voyager
You're the voyager
You're the voyager
I'm the voyager
