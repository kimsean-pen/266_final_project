I cannot fulfill your heart tonight
I love the way you sleep when you're angry
The way the moon reflects such a beautiful light

I've got my thoughts wrapped up in you
I've got my head all messed up with you
So tell me what I've gotta do
Tell me what I've gotta do to be a better man
Tell me what I've gotta be
Tell me what I've gotta be to be the best I can
Tell me what I can do
Tell me what I can do to be better for you.
