you said you won't break my heart
unless you do
you said you won't fall apart
until the end
did we travel all this way
just to survive
did you stay another day?
we could survive
all the sinners and the saints
move in the same direction
they walk in place
until the end
ramble on this barren place
we call our home
dreams of endless landscapes
morphing, in love
