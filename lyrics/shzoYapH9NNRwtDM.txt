"My Life"

I was standing downtown, downtown
Staring at the pebbles on the ground
Tryin to figure out a way up out of this town
And I know yeah, I'm not the only one
So many people out there chase the sun

If you're looking for a free ride, you better run chile
Or you sure won't get too far, oh
You'd better dance a dance
To make the rain come down
If you want to be a star, oh my life

My Life
(Brother you know)
Sho ain't been too easy
My life
(Sister you know)
The life I wanna live
My life
(Mama you know)
You're gonna go through changes
My life
No turnin back
(I'm tellin' you no)

Evernow and then I
Wanna to throw my hands up in the sky
Cause one day I know I'll be flyin high
And I know yeah I got to get down
On my knees and pray
Cause in heart I know I'll see that day

When my freedom comes along
I'm gonna run chile
Cause I know that I'll go far oh, oh
Can't let nobody kill my soul and bring me down
And they know who they are, oh my life

My Life
(Brother you know)
Sho ain't been too easy
My life
(Sister you know)
The life I wanna live
My life
(Mama you know)
You're gonna go through changes
My life
No turnin back
(I'm tellin' you no)

My Life
(Brother you know)
Sho ain't been too easy
My life

No turning back
