Peaceful
And mourned by the passing
Hang your sails
But don't let them go
And lately
You've been some other thing
Full of heat
And chasing your tail
And it feels like all these heavy stones
Have been living in my head so long
I can't remember your name
I can't remember anything
And all that's been had is just a hand on a string
Peaceful
And mourned by the passing
Hang your sails
But don't let them go
