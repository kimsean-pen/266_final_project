When I look up from my pillow
I dream you are there with me
Though you are far away
I know you'll always be near to me

I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me

I look around me
And feel you are ever so close to me
Though tears that flow from my eyes
Bring back memories of you to me

I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me

I was wrong, I will cry
I will love you till the day I die
You alone, you alone and no one else
You belong to me

When morning comes once more
I have the loneliness you left me
Each day drags by
Until finally night time descends on me

I go to sleep, sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep, sleep, sleep
