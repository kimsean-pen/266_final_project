You don't need to be lonely, lonely
I know where you belong at, follow me
You only have to find me, find me
No matter who you are or what you see

You're bound in a cage cursing the day
Insulting the morning
But don't be afraid, we're coming your way
We're gonna call it

Come with us if you give yourself a mind
We will give you your dreams
It's all a song for us
You'll never want to turn away
Once you release control, you'll be lost in a fantasy
Till your soul is lost, you'll be longing to run
Longing to come with us

Find out what you can be, can be, can be
Now that you're surrounded of fate unknown
Welcome to family, family, family
Open up the door, make yourself at home
Set in your way your life to us
And then throw yourself to the falling
You don't need to be afraid,
Come on, this is the calling

Come with us if you give yourself a mind
We will give you your dreams
It's all a song for us
You'll never want to turn away
Under electric stars you'll be living a fantasy
Oh, from dawn to dusk, you'll be longing to run
Longing to come with us

Uuh uh uh uh
Uuh uh uh uh

Come with us if you give yourself a mind
We will give you your dreams
Oh, from dawn to dusk
Come away with me, come away with me
Come on
Come with us in a hazing frame of mind
you'll believe it's down
It's a song for us
And you'll never want to turn away

Under electric stars you'll be lost in a fantasy,
Till your soul is lost, you'll be longing to run
Longing to come with us
