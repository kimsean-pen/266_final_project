We're spiritual when we wanna be
We're online just in time to see:
The highlights from these low-lives
Counting back down from showtime
And selling you a filtered frame

We
We're made in America
We're classic hysteria
We're culture clashing, hazard smashing
Maybe someone's
We
We're made in America
We're fucked and don't care at all
Aesthetically, yeah, we're so pleasing
Maybe someone's

We're justice warriors when we're bored, you see?
Buying bracelets and then channeling
It's basically tradition
To lust for what you're missing
They're selling you a touched up name

We
We're made in America
We're classic hysteria
We're culture clashing, hazard smashing
Maybe someone's
We
We're made in America
We're fucked and don't care at all
Aesthetically, yeah, we're so pleasing
Maybe someone's

We expect everything
And expect nothing less

We
We're made in America
We're classic hysteria
We're culture clashing, hazard smashing
Maybe someone's
We
We're made in America
We're fucked and don't care at all
Aesthetically, yeah, we're so pleasing
Maybe someone's
We
We're made in America
Conveniently spiritual
We're culture vultures picking from
The honest pieces
We
We're made in America
We're fucked and don't care at all
We're fucked and don't care at all
