No one's laughing now
No one's laughing now
I'm sullen and sated
And you can't put a price on me

I won't share this disarray
I won't pull these hands away
I need to be chosen and my God, don't pray for me!
So scatter all my ashes when I'm dead

And shatter every legend in my head
If only the committed will survive
Is anybody here still left alive?

This is mine

Come no further
You'll go to far!
I'm running 'round in circles once again
If you can't forgive me
I won't take it very hard
But I won't make it easy in the end

So scatter all my ashes when I'm dead
And shatter every legend in my head
If only the consented will survive
Is anybody here still left alive?

This is mine!
This is mine!
Yeah!

So scatter all my ashes when I'm dead
And shatter every legend in my head
If only the committed will survive
Is anybody here still left alive?
This is mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
