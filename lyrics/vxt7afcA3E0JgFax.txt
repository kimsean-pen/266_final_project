Faint light of dawn
I'm listening to you
Breathing in and breathing out
Needing nothing

You're honey dipped
You are beautiful
Floating clouds, soft world
I can't feel my lips

I'm going down
I don't want to change
I'm going down
Going down the drain

Don't bring me down
I beg you
Don't bring me down
I won't let you
Don't bring me down

Then all of that's annulled
And I'm anyone's everyone's
We are one
Your face becomes the sun

And I'm addicted
To the joy that the little things
Those little things
The little things they bring

I'm going down
I don't want to change
I'm going down
Going down the drain

Don't bring me down
I beg you
Don't bring me down
I won't let you
Don't bring me down

So now for restless mind
I could go either way

I'm going down
I don't wanna change
I'm going down
Going down the drain

Don't bring me down
I beg you
Don't bring me down
I won't let you

Don't bring me down
I beg you
Don't bring me down
I won't let you

Don't bring me down
I beg you
Don't bring me down
I won't let you
Don't bring me down

There's nothing left to choose
And so I fight a war in my head
Stay the night, protect me
