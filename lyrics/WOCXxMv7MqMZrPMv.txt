This madness has to stop
It's driving me crazy
It makes the devil run trough me
It sets me off the wall
I declare my withdrawal

Gotta suck this poison out of my veins
The monster has got to be enchained
Contain the beast with reason's flame
A Hearteater can not be tamed

Every ending is a new beginning
Please allow me to invite you to leave
Some memories are best forgotten
Now I'm gonna erase

Everything I've done for you
Every word I spoke to you
All the dreams we've ever shared
Are just crumbling to dust

Everything I've done for you
Every word I spoke to you
All the dreams we've ever shared
Are just crumbling to dust

I need closure
I need to start all over
This must come to an end
Kill the monster
All shall fade

Gotta suck this poison out of my veins
The monster has got to be enchained
Contain the beast with reason's flame
A Hearteater can not be tamed

Every ending is a new beginning
Please allow me to invite you to leave
Some memories are best forgotten
Now I'm gonna erase

Everything I've done for you
Every word I spoke to you
All the dreams we've ever shared
Are just crumbling to dust

Everything I've done for you
Every word I spoke to you
All the dreams we've ever shared
Are just crumbling to dust

Everything I've done for you
Every word I spoke to you
All the dreams we've ever shared
Are just crumbling to dust

Everything I've done for you
Every word I spoke to you
All the dreams we've ever shared
Now I'm gonna erase

Everything I've done for you
Every word I spoke to you
All the dreams we've ever shared
Are just crumbling to dust

Everything I've done for you
Every word I spoke to you
All the dreams we've ever shared
Are just crumbling to dust

Every dream
Every word
All we shared
Is just crumbling to dust
I gotta set my soul free
Forget about the plagued years
Sing my swan song to you
And free the bats in the belfry
And free the bats in the belfry
