I'm a saint, I'm a soul
Feel it in my bones, feel it in my bones
I'm a saint, I'm a saint, I'm a soul
Feel it in my bones, feel it in my toes
I'm a saint, I'm a saint, I'm a soul
(Saintlike)

I'm sick and tired of waiting
I'm sick and tired of waiting by the phone, oh
I know you're home
Oh my god Becky, look at that butt (Fuck it up)
Wrists on ice, with the 40s taped up
Got a head full of dreams and a heart full of love
But I never made the money so nobody gave a fuck

Friday night, what you wanna do, solo Halo 2?
Sacrifice, no more Xbox Live in the room
I'm alright, finish 40s while I'm listening to t.A.T.u
"All The Things She Said," and now I'm puking in the bathroom
Gone

Maybe we could take it slow (Slow)
Ain't nobody gotta know (God knows)
Put the phone back in the bag, and let me get your mind

Let me get your mind
Let me get your mind
Let me get your mind on me
We're doing fine (Yeah)

"I don't give a fuck!"

Oh my god Becky, look at that ass
It's that tall motherfucker saying "Don't eat glass"
And you know what they say about a guy with big shoes
Insecurities and self-esteem issues

But Jakey Christ, baby Jakey, baby brother, Baby J
Tell your sister, tell your mother why you're feeling this way
You've been working so hard till it's a.m. in the day
Got the 1, 5, 10, 20, fuck it 100K (Hot Boys)

I don't want to take it slow (Slow)
Fuck what anybody know (They know)
Put the phone inside the trash, and let me get your mind

Let me get your mind
Let me get your mind
Let me get your mind on me
We'll be alright, we'll be al-

"I don't give a fuck!"

I'm a saint, I'm a soul
Feel it in my bones, feel it in my bones
I'm a saint, I'm a saint, I'm a soul
Feel it in my bones, feel it in my toes
I'm a saint, I'm a saint, I'm a soul
(Saintlike)

Oh my god Becky, look at that butt
Wrists on ice, with the 40s taped up
Got a head full of dreams and a heart full of love
But I never made the money so nobody gave a fuck

Think he funny, think he cute, think he ugly, think he stupid
Think he gay, think he straight, think he special, think he human
Think he changed, think he can't, think he probably shoulda' gave up
You fuckin' with him now, and his name is fuckin' Jake (I'm gone)

I've left, I'm like
My friends, my friends (I'm sick and tired of waiting)
My friends, my friends (I'm sick and tired of waiting)
My friends,
I'm just like my friends (I'm sick and tired of waiting by the phone)
I'm just like my friends (I'm sick and tired of waiting)
I'm just like my friends (I'm sick and tired of waiting by the phone)
I'm just like my friends (I'm sick and tired of waiting)
I'm just like my friends (I'm sick and tired of waiting by the phone)
I'm just like my friends (I'm sick and tired of waiting)
I'm just (I'm sick and tired of waiting by the phone)
I'm just (I'm sick and tired of waiting)
I'm just, I'm just (I'm sick and)

"I don't give a fuck!"
