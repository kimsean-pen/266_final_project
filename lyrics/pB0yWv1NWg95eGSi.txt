Come to my house
Be one of the comfortable people
Come to this house
We're drinking all night
Never sleeping

Milkman come in
And you baker
Little old lady, welcome
And you shoemaker

Come to this house
Into this house

Come to this house
Be one of us
Make this your house
Be one of us

You can help
To collect some more in
Young and old people
Let's get them all in

Come to this house
Into this house

Ask along that man
Who's wearing a carnation
Bring every single person
From Victoria Station
Go into that hospital
And bring nurses and patients
Everybody go home
And fetch their relations

Come to this house
Be one of the comfortable people
Lovely bright home
Drinking all night
Never sleeping

Excuse me, sir, there's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more!

We need more room
Build an extension
A colourful palace
Spare no expense now

Come to this house
Be one of us
Come into this house
Be one of us

Come to this house
Into this house

Welcome...
