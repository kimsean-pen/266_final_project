Somebody told me you'll go out of your mind
In the heat,
In the heat of the disco night
You will be deaf before your eyes go blind
In the heat,
In the heat of a disco night

But now I'm dancing whether wrong or right
In the heat,
In the heat of a disco night
I think I like it baby, hold me tight
In the heat,
In the heat of a disco night
Of a disco night

Disco fever
Disco fever
Disco fever
Disco fever
Disco fever
Disco fever
And still my temperature will ri-i-i-i-ise

Disco fever
Disco fever
Disco fever
Disco fever
Disco fever
Disco fever
And still my temperature will ri-i-i-i-ise

I like this feeling Mister Fahrenheit
In the heat,
In the heat of a disco night
I'll hit the ceiling on a beam of light
In the heat,
In the heat of a disco night
Of a disco night

Disco fever
Disco fever
Disco fever
Disco fever
Disco fever
Disco fever
And still my temperature will ri-i-i-i-ise

Disco fever
Disco fever
Disco fever
Disco fever
Disco fever
Disco fever
And still my temperature will ri-i-i-i-ise

Disco fever
Disco fever
Disco fever
Disco fever
Disco fever
Disco fever
