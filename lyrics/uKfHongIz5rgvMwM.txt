I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
'cause I'm so in love with you

They see me night and daytime
Having such a gay time
They don't know what I go through
I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
'cause I'm still in love with you

No one knows it's just a pose
Pretending I'm glad we're apart
But when I cry, my eyes are dry
The tears are in my heart

My darling, can't we make up?
Ever since our breakup
Make believe is all I do
I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
'cause I'm so in love with you

I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside...
