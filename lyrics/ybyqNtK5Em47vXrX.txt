Standing still
As they charge
We will
Hold our ground
Not back down
We will
Raise our swords
From the ground

And we will fight the war to end
All the suffering
Never fearing
Heros foes
Or the daring
And their cause
To the gods we pray
Never waive
Time has come for us
To take charge
And fight the power

Standing still
As they charge
We will
Hold our ground
Not back down
We will
Raise our swords
From the ground
And we will fight the war to end
All the suffering
Never fearing
Heros foes
Or the daring
And their cause
To the gods we pray
Never waive
Time has come for us
To take charge
And fight the power
