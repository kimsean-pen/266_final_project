Who was the one that stood beside you through the war of your life
Who stood defiant in the face of your enemy
Who was the one you could confide in
when your adversaries made you run and hide
There's no messiah out there waiting to deliver you now
You've lost the war and have surrendered your sanity
What was before has now been scattered
from the heavy devastation left behind

You made it happen again
Threw your cover away
Built battlements to stand for all time
You've waged your war of lies

Discarded your disguise
I was the one you said could never be a part of your life
I was the one who had a moment of clarity
Only a son could stay devoted to a fabricator living their own lies

The ones who loved you can no longer be a part of you now
You're very deft at trying to garner their sympathy
Look how affection will reveal the
shadowy image of the criminal inside
You made it happen again

Threw your honor away
You may never learn until you're denied
You've waged your war of lies
Discarded your disguise

Seen through damnation's eyes
You blame me for your lies
You don't get it
You won't let it

You won't ever admit your fucking lie
You don't get it
I won't let it
I won't believe this time

You've waged your war of lies
Discarded your disguise
Seen through damnation's eyes
You blame me for your lies

You've waged your war of lies
Discarded your disguise
Seen through damnation's eyes
You blame me for your lies
