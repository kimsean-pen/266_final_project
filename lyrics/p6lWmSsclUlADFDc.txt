I'm serving time
All for a crime I did commit
You want the truth?
You know I'd do it all again
Left for dead
Heaven is only in my head

I heard a voice
Calling from down inside a well
"See that silver shine?"
She said to come claim what was mine
So down I fell
Down into the water black
My prison cell
Only the moon was shining back

If I seem lost, well I weighted the cost
And chose my crime-
Now it's mine all mine!

I heard the voice
Calling from just outside the well
She said "You fool, now that
you know your end is near;
You always fall
For what you desire
or what you fear!"

Resurrected, living in a lighthouse
If we leave, them ships are gonna wreck
Resurrected, living in a lighthouse
The lions and the lambs ain't sleeping yet

Resurrected
Living in a lighthouse
Can you see the funny side?
Them ships are gonna wreck
Resurrected
living in a lighthouse
The lions and the lambs ain't sleeping yet

Resurrected
Living in a lighthouse
If you leave
Them ships are gonna wreck
Resurrected
living in a lighthouse
The lions and the lambs ain't sleeping yet
The lions and the lambs ain't sleeping yet
The lions and the lambs ain't sleeping yet
