cuties to the force with appeal
here to make the habit and show how you feel
we got the right kind of rhythm, the kind of right rhythm you want
the right kind of rhythm, the kind of right rhythm you want

keep feeding the rhythm
keep feeding the rhythm

feed the rhythm inside
feed the rhythm inside

from the thunder of the streets there's a lightning reaction
way beyond the human touch, just can't get enough
stay on the beat cause we need no relief from the music that's pumping

remote people
ya hold the key to the night
remote people
break out the freedom and

feed the rhythm inside
feed the rhythm inside
it's the right kind of sound oh
feed the silence within ya

turn up the treble to our level, speakers to the sky
every letter in your weather, it's kicking on the hi-fi
you don't need to fear your own vibrations cause
all you hear is the liberated life, is the liberated life

keep only holding yourself high
and step on the beat cause
the one you want to be, it's all you need to satisfy satisfy

the rhythm machine it's kicking on the hi-fi
