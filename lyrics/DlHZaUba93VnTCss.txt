I lost 6 of my years
Fighting fire with fear
And its tearing me apart inside
I can point? all the blame
Try to relive the shame
But I think its time I took back my life
'Cause I'm sick of the person I used to be
So stressed out, burned out, living in my agony
Hated all the words that they said to me
So I jacked up, blacked out, wasted? all those memories
I won't go back
I won't go back
I won't go back
'Cause I'm sick of youI'm sick of me
I'm sick of the person I used to be
What a pointless mistake
Such a slap in the face
Gotta turn this thing around again
No more holding it back
No more bending the facts
I'll push myself, push myself Till I understand
'Cause I'm sick of the person I used to be
So stressed out, burned out, living in my agony
Hated all the words that they said to me
So I jacked up, blacked out, wasted? all those memories
I won't go backI won't go backI won't go back
'Cause I'm sick of youI'm sick of me
I'm sick of the person I used to be
Save me from the tragedy
All the memories gone bad
Save me from the legacy
From my history
Just save me from my broken past
Just save me from my broken past
'Cause I'm sick of the person I used to be
So stressed out, burned out, living in my agony
Hated all the words that they said to me
So I jacked up, blacked out, wasted? all those memoriesI won't go back
I won't go backI won't go back
'Cause I'm sick of youI'm sick of meI'm sick of the person I used to be
