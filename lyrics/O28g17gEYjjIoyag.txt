Slip out of a dream and into the fog
Your home caught fire, you can't see for the smog
All I wanted to touch
All I wanted to feel
A code in braille I can read on your skin

Hello stranger, don't let me stay too long
Goodbye pleasure, I must be getting on

Slip into my room and stop making sense
High on desire, is there anything else
All I wanted to touch
All I wanted to feel
A code in braille I can read on your skin

So do you wanna get along
Or do you wanna get on
Or do you wanna get gone
Or do you wanna get it on

Hello stranger, don't let me stay too long
Goodbye pleasure, I must be getting on

Pleasure seeker where hearts grow weaker
My body's broken in, your love is spoken for

Slip into the dark and out of your mind
Be Robin Hood if our scars don't align
All I wanted to touch
All I wanted to feel
A code in braille I erased from your skin

Hello stranger, don't let me stay too long
Goodbye pleasure, I must be getting on

...and you could be all in
...and I'll be all over you ...and still we'd fall from grace ...what's it all about, baby?
