If I could change my life
I'd take a knife
And cut away all those days
Since the time
When you were mine
And that's the way I'd stay

If we could push rewind
I think we'd find
We would do it all again
I wish somehow
I did not know now
What I did not know then

I know it's not the right thing to do
If experience holds true
History is a circle with you
So I'll be coming back, coming back

If I had world enough and time
I know that I could make you mine
If you would just give me a sign
I know that I could change your mind
Your mind

If you're concerned
When you learned
You don't know where you're going
Look at me
Then you'll see
I don't know where I've been

It hurt me so
To let you go
I never could call you friend
Sometimes at night
To make it right
I need you back again

I know it's not the right thing to say
But I am just that way
If only night did not follow day
Then I'd be coming back, coming back

If I had world enough and time
I know that I could make you mine
If you would just give me a sign
I know that I could change your mind
Your mind

(I am where my destiny has led me)
