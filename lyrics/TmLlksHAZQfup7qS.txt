I am the one left decaying in the dark
Confess my sins but missing the start
What was it like to be so sober?

What was it like to walk up a lonely path
Trying to be a better man
But I've never felt such hurt
I am distortion

Inhale distortion

I am the spineless protection
The fatal injection
I sold my soul to the saint of depression

I'll always pray for something new
Through all the shit you made me do
I am distortion
Inhale distortion

I never want to leave
I am the pain you would never see
I only know this anxiety
I never wanted to leave

I never wanted to leave

For what it's worth I know my sin
Wide awake at night and I'm giving in
I can taste your poison, see what you create
Cos deep inside
I'm the one you hate

I can taste your poison, see what you create
Cos deep inside
I'm the one you hate

I never want to leave
I am the pain you would never see
I only know this anxiety
I never wanted to leave

I never want to leave
I am the pain you would never see
I only know this anxiety
I never wanted to leave

I never wanted to leave
I am the one that you hate.
