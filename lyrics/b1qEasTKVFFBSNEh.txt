Beauty is in the eye of the beholder many say
Will you still value me when old and grey?
Brains and looks cannot really combine
I hate to say it but I feel totally divine
Chorus:
I am not changing just because you say
Like Mona Lisa
I'm here to stay
Convention tells us looks and brains are a no
Why is it so hard not to follow the flow?
Children are told a heartbreaker to be
Great expectations you have to see
Chorus:
I am not changing just because you say
Like Mona Lisa
I'm here to stay
Why study hard and get a hard degree?
Beauty comes first and is all they see
A life in confusion and total illusion
Both can for sure join in a fusion
Chorus:
I am not changing just because you say
Like Mona Lisa
I'm here to stay
Some claim Mona was really a man
The secret lay in Leonardo's plan
A life in distortion a shivering wreck
I claim now I don't care a heck
Chorus:
I am not changing just because you say
Like Mona Lisa
I'm here to stay
