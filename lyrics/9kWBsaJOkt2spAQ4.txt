Today I told myself
That I would control myself
But my heart and zipper
Seems to disagree

Where is this coming
From progressively, sinking deep
That my old private school
Ain't proud of me?
You've got me

Spin it like a DJ
Don't care what they say
Every minute, every day
I'm waiting for the moment

Don't know who this girl is
But she wants to make a mess
Don't wait till you're finished
Now we're on to something golden

Where is my head?
Where is my head?
I'm running
Where is my head?
Where is my head?

It seems I lost my mind
Back when we first met
But at that second
Everything had changed

I might be modest
On the outside, looking in
But your mouth and body's
Got the best of me
You've got me

Spin it like a DJ
Don't care what they say
Every minute, every day
I'm waiting for the moment

Don't know who this girl is
But she wants to make a mess
Don't wait till you're finished
Now we're on to something golden

Where is my head?
Where is my head?
I'm running
Where is my head?
Where is my head?

This is just crazy
It's so unlike me
Obsessing over you
Is making me thirsty

You got me
You got me

Spin it like a DJ
Don't care what they say
Every minute, every day
I'm waiting for the moment

Don't know who this girl is
But she wants to make a mess
Don't wait till you're finished
Now we're on to something golden

Where is my head?
Where is my head?
I'm running
Where is my head?
Where is my head?
