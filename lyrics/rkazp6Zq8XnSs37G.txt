Oh, you're bringing me down to my knees
First I'm your predator then I'm your prey
Give me your love and then take it away

And from there you're so easy to please
Give me a kiss like a kick in the teeth
My bloody lip never tasted so sweet, oh

Give me a kiss like a kick in the teeth
My body lip never tasted so sweet, oh

You're my number 13
Honey

So sweet
My beauty queen
There's something about your love
That makes me wanna kill it
My 13, wouh
There's something about your love
Your l-l-l-love

And it's all in the way that you talk
Starts with a whisper and ends with a shout
Give me a kiss and then spit in my mouth

You're my number 13
Honey

So sweet
My beauty queen
There's something about your love
That makes me wanna kill it
My 13, wouh
There's something about your love
Your l-l-l-love

So sweet
My beauty queen
There's something about your love
That makes me wanna kill it
My 13, wouh
There's something about your love
Your love
