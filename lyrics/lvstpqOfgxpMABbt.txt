City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get out the county 'cause you're bad and free
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they've got to kiss me
Because I don't get sleep, no

Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats
Lining 'em up like ass cracks
Play these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack
Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (yeah)
Care Bear rappin' in harder this year (yeah)
Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
With yo' sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
With yo' sound, you kill the Inc.
So don't stop, get it, get it (get it)
Until you're cheddar head
And watch the way I navigate
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good

Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Don't stop, get it, get it
Peep how your captain's in it
Steady, watch me navigate
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Don't stop, get it, get it
Peep how your captain's in it
Steady, watch me navigate
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
