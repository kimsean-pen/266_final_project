I set a fire to the moon shape
We are just shadows in the cascades of history
Faded love in your own games
The sky will lead

I set our bodies in my long show
This heavy whisper makes me more scared than anything
I was loved and then I lost love
I know they'll never find her
Swear out I'll lose the madness

I feel free in time
Fall depths with me miles apart
In light, we solve our own lives
In time, you breach the brighter parts
In light, we fall

You brought me something from this long jog
My twisted body and a body that you want to break
This house is covered by your blood spoke
Don't give a fuck what's taken
I hear these walls are making

I just leave in time
Fall depths with me miles apart
In light, we solve our own lives
In time, you breach the brighter parts
In light, we fall

So lay down all limbs
All on mambos, they are fable
Blinded all over
Been casted all out into the light

And I sense all your romance
Here I am only, you are able
To run from the scare
Feeling alone to feel alive

In time, fall depths with me miles apart
In light, we solve our own lives
In time, you breach the brighter parts
In light, we fall

In time, fall depths with me miles apart
In light, we solve our own lives
Oh in time
Oh in time, you breach the brighter parts
In light, we fall
In time
