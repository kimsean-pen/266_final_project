Someone to count on
In a world ever changin'
Here I am
Stop where you're standin'

What you need is a lover
Someone to take over
Oh baby don't look any further

Strange when you think of our chances
That we'be both been in a state of mind
Too cool to be careless, looking for the right thing
Oh baby don't look any further

(Tonight)
Tonight we're gonna taste a little paradise
(Rockin' all night long)
Rockin' all night long
(Daylight)
Daylight I'll still be looking in your heavenly eyes
We'll go on and on and on and on

Day o umba day o mambu ji ay o
Don't look any further
(Don't you look no further)
Day o umba day o na jam bay um bay o
Don't look any further

Someone to count on
(Someone to count on)
In a world ever changin'
(Yeah)
Here I am
Stop where you're standin'

What you need is a lover
(You need a lover)
Someone to take over
(Someone to take over)
Oh baby don't look any further
(Further)

(Tonight)
Tonight we're gonna taste a little paradise
(Rockin' all night long)
Rockin' all night long
(Daylight)
Daylight I'll still be looking in your heavenly eyes
We'll go on and on and on

Day o umba day o mambu ji ay o
Don't look any further
(Don't you look no further)
Day o umba day o na jam bay um bay o
Don't look any further

Day o umba day o mambu ji ay o
Don't look any further
(Don't you look no further)
Day o umba day o na jam bay um bay o
(Ooh baby)
Don't look any further

(Tonight)
Tonight we're gonna taste a little paradise
(Rockin' all night long)
Rockin' all night long
(Daylight)
Daylight I'll still be looking in your heavenly eyes
We'll go on and on and on and on

Day o umba day o mambu ji ay o
Don't look any further
