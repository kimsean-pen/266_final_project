I know that you feel like leavin'
We can't seem to get along
I know you are the only one for me
My everything
You are all that a girl could wish for
I couldn't ask for more
We don't need to argue about
Silly things anymore

Remember all of the good times
Think about it for awhile
I would be incomplete without you in my life
Tell me

You can't leave
You will always be a part of me
Baby, wherever you go
You will always be a part of me
Always

Some long as I say we don't mean
Like we should go our separate ways
Not considering the love and time that we
Shared together
I be feeling like you're really afraid
To love me as I love you
Let me live inside of your love
Freely

Remember all of the good times
Think about it for awhile
I would be incomplete without you in my life
Tell me

You can't leave
You will always be a part of me
Baby, wherever you go
You will always be a part of me
Always

You can't leave
You will always be a part of me
Baby, wherever you go
You will always be a part of me
Always

At night I wish upon a star
And hope that you are near, not far
And that you are loving me always
An' when I lay me down to sleep
I pray that our love will always keep
And that you are loving me

Don't ever let me go, go away
We are too late, so late
What am I supposed to do?
Tell me

You can't leave
You will always be a part of me
Baby, wherever you go
You will always be a part of me
Always

You can't leave
You will always be a part of me
Baby, wherever you go
You will always be a part of me
Always

You can't leave
You will always be a part of me
Baby, wherever you go
You will always be a part of me
Always
