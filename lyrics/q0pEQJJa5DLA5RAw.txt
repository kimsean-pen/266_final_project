It's funny how things work out,
The ones we need don't know we're there,
If I were sand and you were oceans,
The moon would be why you're pulled to me.

I wake up and think dreams are real,
I sleep so I don't have to feel,
The truth that you can't ever be,
The one person that won't ever forget me.

I hope that dreams come when I die,
So we can talk,
I won't wake up,
I'll ask you how your life worked out.

I'll never know that I'm just dreaming,
I wake up and think dreams are real,
I sleep so I don't have to feel,
The truth that you can't ever be,
The one person that won't ever forget me.

Let me sleep some more (8x)
