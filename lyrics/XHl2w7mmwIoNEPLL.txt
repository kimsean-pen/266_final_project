If you're the thief in the night,
Then let me be a masterpiece,
Make you the king of my heart,
If you forever stay true to me, yeah,

I'll never stop,
Keep it goin,
I'm the one,
And you know it,
Hold you down yeah,
Took my heart,
Now you got it,
Couldn't leave you,
If I wanted,
Hold me tighter,

Baby, I'ma be there,
You know I'ma be there,
Baby, I'ma be there,

Just when you think you're by yourself,
Turn around,
Cos I'm right there,
I'ma be there,
You know I'ma be there,
Baby, I'ma be there,

If I leave you breathless,
Then I'll be the air you need,
And if you lose your faith in love,
I'll make you believe,
Yeah,

I'll never stop,
Keep it goin,
I'm the one,
And you know it,
Hold you down yeah,
Took my heart,
Now you got it,
Couldn't leave you,
If I wanted,

Hold me tighter,

Baby, I'ma be there,
You know I'ma be there,
