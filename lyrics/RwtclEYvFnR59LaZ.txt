Books and covers and part time lovers
Spinning rooms in cities of rust
I'm stranded, struck out on this line
Of smoke and fire and steel and wire
And glass and spire and dust
On to the floor at dawn with lips taught and drawn
Sleepless nights I've spent with angels heaven sent

Stay with me, lay with me, lay down by my side
Stay with me, lay with me, take me deep inside
Lay with me, stay with me, lay with me
Stay, with me
Stay, with me

Born of the sign of air and the twins
Speak of days and another place
I wander as the gypsy under a beckoning moon
Speak of time and another face
A wayward and languid cry a fleeting and furtive sigh
From the cradle to the grave a love to desire and crave

Stay with me, lay with me, lay down by my side
Stay with me, lay with me, take me deep inside
Lay with me, stay with me, lay with me
Stay, with me
Stay, with me

I'll laugh for you, and I'll dance for you
But don't ask me to shed any tears when I have to go
You are a joy and a pleasure to love and to hold
Your promise is as pure as the driven snow
Passing ships in the night a touch distraught and light
Eyes that brightly shine, your love tonight is mine

Stay with me, lay with me, lay down by my side
Stay with me, lay with me, take me deep inside
Lay with me, stay with me, lay with me
Stay, with me
Stay, with me
