Hey, you still cool about it?
'Bout me staying a while?
Girl, I'll add some style to this home
Not a first date yet
You can fix all your phones
Until you're pretty known
Oh my, oh my god
I've been here for a minute
And it looks like you're in it for the long...
Oh my, oh my god
Yeah, you've been known for pleasure
But you'll stick with bad weather
How can you be so sure?
Nothing more than a few smooth words
A warm embrace when I saw you hurt
How can you be so sure?
When nothing more than a three short years
I think on when I see you here
Oh my, oh my gosh
I've been here for a minute
And it seems like you're in it for the long...
Oh my, oh my gosh
Yeah, you've been known for pleasure
But you'll stick with bad weather
Hey, you still cool about it?
'Bout me staying a while
Girl, I'll add some style to this home
'Bout me staying a while
Girl, I'll add some style to this home
I'll add some style to this home (Oh my)
I'll add some style (Oh my)
I'll add some style to this home (Oh my)
Oh my
Oh my
Oh my
Oh my
