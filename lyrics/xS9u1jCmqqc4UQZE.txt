Holy water on the brain and I? m losing sleep
Holy Bible on the night stand next to me
As I'm raped by another monkey circus freak
Trying to take my indigence away from me, from me

Yeah, holy water is rusting me
Yeah, holy water is rusting me, is rusting me
Rusting me

Bloody murder is the best, I've heard her scream
Holy devil in the flesh, some might believe
And they take thine majesty so seriously
'Cause it's the big lies are more likely to be believed

Yeah, holy water is rusting me
Yeah, holy water is rusting me, is rusting me
Rusting me, yeah

Damn the water if it's life, you want to drink
Mind your mother if it makes you feel at ease
As you? re raped by another monkey circus freak
'Cause it's the big lies are more likely to be believed

Yeah, holy water is rusting me
Yeah, holy water is rusting me
Yeah, holy water is rusting me, is rusting me
Rusting me
Rusting me
Rusting me, yeah
Rusting me
