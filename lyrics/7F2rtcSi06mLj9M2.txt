I met a guy at the club
I let him know I'm alone

I met a girl at the bar
I let her know who you are

I told her you are the love of my life and
One day you gonna be my wife and
We are gonna answer neighbours together ahhaa

I told him you are the man of my dreams
You saved me from drowning in the streams
I know we're really gonna last forever and ever...

It was those, 3 words that saved my life...
It wasn't complicated
Wasn't pre-meditated
It wasn't under-rated
Boy I'm so glad you stayed and
It was those 3 words that saved my life...
It wasn't complicated
Wasn't pre-meditated
To you I'm dedicated
So just go ahead and say it

I love you I love you I love you
You are the love of my life... my life...
I love you I love you I love you
You are the love of my life... my life...

You know you're holdin my heart
Ain't nothin tear us apart

You know I'm so in love with you
Can't nothin tear us apart no

I said I-L-O-V-E-Y-O-U
I'm so into you girl
I said M-E-T-O-O
It's obvious I'm so into you boy
So why don't we (we) hold (hold) on (on) for (to) love (love)
Through the ups and downs never let go
Holdin on forever never let go
It all started with 3 words that saved my life
It wasn't complicated
It wasn't complicated
It wasn't complicated
It wasn't complicated
Baby those 3 words that saved my life...

I love you I love you I love you
You are the love of my life... my life...
I love you I love you I love you
You are the love of my life... my life...
