When you take my hand, Your face is all I see
And all the walls they go black, Like a movie screen
My feet start to mobe, what you do to the stinolium
It's like the perfect dance floor
Put your hands by my waist, I hear the violins
And one step is all it takes, And then my head spins
I don't see the walls at all...
Since the minute we stepped away from this place

We're dancing and then the world disappears
We're dancing to music no one else hears
It's magic, It's like we're stopping time
When your heart beats mine
When we're dancing, dancing, dancing
When we're dancing, dancing, dancing
When we're dancing

World is soft like a blur, All I see is color
Hardest fall so it hurts, When we're with eachother
You're a sweet song bird, When your singing in my ear
Goosebumps run down my skin

We're dancing and then the world disappears
We're dancing to music no one else hears
It's magic, It's like we're stopping time
When your heart beats mine
When we're dancing, dancing, dancing
When we're dancing, dancing, dancing
When we're dancing

I think that we could live for moments like this
The sweetest romances, Feels like there's all this magic
And we've just got to grab it
When we're dancing

We're dancing and then the world disappears
We're dancing to music no one else hears
It's magic, It's like we're stopping time
When your heart beats mine
When we're dancing

We're dancing and then the world disappears
We're dancing to music no one else hears
It's magic, It's like we're stopping time
When your heart beats mine
When we're dancing, dancing, dancing
When we're dancing, dancing, dancing
When we're dancing
