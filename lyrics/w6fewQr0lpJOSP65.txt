I see you waiting for a sign
Some resolve to ease your mind
Maybe you're not
Awake as we thought
Every hope within your dreams
Wasted on a faith in dead and dying things
Wither away
Into our grave

I can see the forest for the trees
Feel the wound before it bleeds
I've been waiting for that debt to come and take me to my knees
But I can't wait for peace
I can't wait for peace

And we have seen tomorrow's lead
Let's dwell in truth for once
There's no release
Ever we go
Into the cold
Ever we go
Go it alone

I can see the forest for the trees
Feel the wound before it bleeds
I've been waiting for that debt to come and take me to my knees
But I can't wait for peace
I can't wait for peace

Ooh
Is it over, can we tell?
Peace or only Hell
Ooh
If it seems to convalesce
Try and hold your breath

I know it's hard to abandon your path
When this is all that you have

I can see the forest for the trees
Feel the wound before it bleeds
I've been waiting for that debt to come and take me to my knees
But I can't wait for peace
I can't wait for peace
