Devious to those unknown, he walks below the land
Alluring victims to their death, perish to the sand
Master of the blackened arts, living his decree
Thrives amongst the Seven Gates, searching for the keys

I have seen the darkened depths of Hell
Sorcery beyond the witches' spell
Robbed the crypts of Death's eternity
Killed the priest and cursed him endlessly

Chants of evil incantation fill the murky night
Free the Devil's knights of Hell, unleash their growing spite
Directing power forcibly, the fire of Hell is cast
Resurrect from crypts of Death, a demon from the past

I have seen the darkened depths of Hell
Sorcery beyond the witches' spell
Robbed the crypts of Death's eternity
Killed the priest and cursed him endlessly

Cringe with fear
Violate the unbroken seal of Hell
Death will come searching for your mere soul
Still you are eager to seek your fate
All that lie here are remains of death

Grinding bones, screaming skulls
Broken by the lapse of time
Decay to powder, ashes to dust
Diminishing, disintegrating man's soul and mind

Empty space tracks throughout
I make my claim

Disease engulfs, covers the world
My kingdom, my domain
