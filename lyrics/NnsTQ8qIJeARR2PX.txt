You were standing on the shore
Listening to the ocean's roar
Sea breeze tangled in your hair
Immortal, young and free of cares
You let the night lull you away to
Dark pacific palisades yeah

Wait for the summer
It'll come round again

Listening to the ocean's roar
Sea breeze tangled in your hair
Immortal, young and free of cares
You let the night lull you away to
Dark pacific palisades yeah

Wait for the summer
It'll come round again

It's coming down in sheets of rain
Water's running in the drains
I lie with candles in my bed
Brian Wilson in my head
Dennis Wilson, Sharon Tate
Dark pacific palisades, yeah,

Wait for the summer
It'll come round again

Dragged down by the undertow
I know I can't live forever
She is fire in my soul
I know I can't live without her
All I have is in my hand
Only you can understand yeah

Wait for the summer
It'll come round again

You were standing on the shore
Listening to the ocean's roar
Sea breeze tangled in your hair
Immortal, young and free of cares
You let the night lull you away to
Dark pacific palisades yeah

Wait for the summer
It'll come round again
