Release
The sword of Damocles
Just release it
To the authorities

We have been given
The same fortune cookies
You and I have
All of our progenies

Raise kindness
Above all else
Avoid the books of
Hatred behind the shelves

I will caress your
Caress your curly hair
With affection
Many a good reason to cut off your head
Then and then

Release
The Sword of Damocles
Just release it
I'm begging
You on my knees
