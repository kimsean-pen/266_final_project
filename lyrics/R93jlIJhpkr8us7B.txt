I thought we had it made up
After all we had to pay up
Keep a market on the seller
That's the way to win a dollar

But I don't know
And I don't mind
Leave my weary bones
And fly

You're telling me just one more
I keep it like it's torture
Keep my body like a soldier
You gotta tell me when it's over

But I don't know
And I don't mind
Take my weary bones
And fly

Fly
Fly
Fly
Fly
Fly
Fly
Fly
Fly
