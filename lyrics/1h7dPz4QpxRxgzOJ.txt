You and me, too good to be
Too true to be, too dumb to see
Where I live and where you live
Are not the same, we're not to blame

It's too crazy and far too hard
And way too lazy to make it work
So here I am, I'm still alone
I'm still awake, I'm still afraid

I don't know what day it is
Because I've been up all night
I don't know what week it is
Because I've been up all night

I want to see you, I want to see you
I want to see you, I want to see you
Forever and ever, forever and ever
Forever and ever, forever

You and me, too good to be
Too true to be, too dumb to see
Where I live and where you live
Are not the same, we're not to blame

Now you're off in another town
With another girl, just sitting around
I'm still here, I'm still alone
I'm still awake, I'm still afraid

I don't know what day it is
Because I've been up all night
I don't know what week it is
Because I've been up all night

I want to see you, I want to see you
I want to see you, I want to see you
Forever and ever, forever and ever
Forever and ever, forever

You left me here alone
You left me here in the cold
You left me here by the sea
Oh well, now all I wish I could see
Is you and me

I don't know what day it is
Because I've been up all night
I don't know what week it is
Because I've been up all night

I want to see you, I want to see you
I want to see you, I want to see you
Forever and ever, forever and ever
Forever and ever, forever, ooh
