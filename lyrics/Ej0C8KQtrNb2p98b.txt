Let's go back
Back to the beginning
Back to when the earth, the sun, the stars all aligned

'Cause perfect, didn't feel so perfect
Trying to fit a square into a circle
Was no life
I defy

Let the rain fall down
And wake my dreams
Let it wash away
My sanity
'Cause I wanna feel the thunder
I wanna scream
Let the rain fall down
I'm coming clean
I'm coming clean, oh

I'm shedding
Shedding every color
Trying to find a pigment of truth
Beneath my skin, oh

'Cause different
Doesn't feel so different
And going out is better
Than always staying in
Feel the wind

Let the rain fall down
And wake my dreams
Let it wash away
My sanity
'Cause I wanna feel the thunder
I wanna scream
Let the rain fall down
I'm coming clean
I'm coming clean

I'm coming clean, oh
Let the rain fall
Let the rain fall
I'm coming

Let the rain fall down
And wake my dreams
Let it wash away
My sanity
'Cause I wanna feel the thunder
I wanna scream
Let the rain fall down
I'm coming clean

Oh, I'm coming clean
Oh, I'm coming clean
Let the rain fall
Let the rain fall
Let the rain fall
I'm coming clean
Oh
Let's go back
Back to the beginning
