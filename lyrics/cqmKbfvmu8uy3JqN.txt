The nights in bloom,
Hanging under electric light.
???
Flowers in the black and white,
Hidden song,
Singing under street lights.
Like I call for you,
Anywhere, a bird in flight.

And the nights in bloom,
She will be waking somewhere on another afternoon.
I get my translations and originals all confused.

I fall,
Anytime, anytime you like.
I've been blow for blow,
Step into the,
Step into the light.

Because I've been told,
We're born between mirrors take every chance don't fall.
Don't get your translations and originals all confused.
When you find yourself waking, somewhere on another afternoon.

Just be careful what you choose.
Careful what you choose.

Just be careful what you choose.
Just be careful what you choose.
Just be careful what you choose.
