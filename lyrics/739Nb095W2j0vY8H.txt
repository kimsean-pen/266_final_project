I got lost, couldn't find my way
And I guess there's nothin' more to say
Love can make you blind, make you act so strange
But I'm here and here I will stay

So everyday I cry, (everyday)
Yes, everyday I fall, (everyday)
You ever wonder why, (everyday)
Why I love everythin' about you?

But everyday I say, "I'll try to make my heart be still"
'Til then every way there is to cry ourselves to sleep, we will

It picked me up, knocked me off my feet
I've got no way to explain
Still I love you, love you, love you, but this fire inside
Will never see the light of day

So everyday goes by, (everyday)
And everyday I fall, (everyday)
It makes me wonder why, (everyday)
My life's worth nothing without you?

But everyday I say, "I'll try to make my heart be still"
'Cause every way there is to cry ourselves to sleep, we will

You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know just how close we were
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know
No, you'll never see

The book closes, and we try to forget
But I know that things won't change
How we feel, how life goes on
And that seems so strange

And so the light fades away, (everyday)
Try, try, try as I may, (Everyday)
I can't stop thinkin' about you, (everyday)
It seems my life's worth nothing without you

But everyday I say, "I'll try to make my heart be still"
'Til then every way there is to cry ourselves to sleep, we will
Everyday, everyday, you know I try so hard
Everyday, everyday, it gets a little harder
Everyday, everyday, you know I try so hard
Everyday, everyday, it gets a little harder
