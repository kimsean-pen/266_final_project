Island shores
Endless waves
Sea cucumbers
And enticing caves

Water, hundreds of colours
But I'd be better off blind
You have several intentions
In your labyrinth mind
I have many impressions of you
Scorpionfish
Go on, come back and haunt me
As you wish

Nothing helps
Months and years
Nothing earthly
Will allay my fears

Water, hundreds of colours
But I'd be better off blind
You have several intentions
In your labyrinth mind
I have many impressions of you
Scorpionfish
Go on, come back and haunt me
As you wish
