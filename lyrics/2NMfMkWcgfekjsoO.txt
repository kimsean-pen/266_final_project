Well, she's gone, gone this morning
See what a fool I've been
Oh, Lord
I said, "What a fool I've been"

Got a train, a train to Georgia
Sixteen-coaches long
Oh, Lord
I said, "Sixteen-coaches long"

I walked out onto the highway
Oh, Lord
I said, "Greyhound bus at dawn"

Oh, so nice
I hear

I walked out onto the highway
Greyhound bus at dawn
Oh, Lord
I said, "Greyhound bus at dawn"

Was it long time ago?
Sure, dear

Well, she's gone, gone this morning
See what a fool I've been
So long
I said, "What a fool I've been"
