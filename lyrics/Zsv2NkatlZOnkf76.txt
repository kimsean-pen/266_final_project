Takin' off, liftin' off, like I'm shootin' straight for Mars
Sorry Ma, I've been gone, haven't been home in like months
Now I'm off, now I'm off, sipping dope like I'm a fiend
I been drunk, I been drunk, but girl please don't fix me
Wanna own me, control me, but it cannot hold me
I've been inside my mind, been wasting time all by my lonely
Off the handle, drinking Jack, I shoulda changed my name to Daniel
Wax is burning like a candle but my homie owes me
So stay focused, remember what you're here for
Told 'em that the drink was empty, they already got more
They got more and all I am is happy now
Full-force bitch, who the fuck gon' stop me now?
So who gon' stop me now? Who gon' stop me now?
Who gon' stop me now? Who gon' stop me now?
Who gon' stop me now? Who gon' stop me now?
Who gon' stop me now?
I been here, I been really here
Had no fear, baby had no fear
I been here, I been really here
Had no fear, baby had no fear
I've been lost, I've been lost in the sauce
I've been lost, I've been lost in the sauce
I've been lost, I've been lost in the sauce
Had no fear, baby had no fear
I been in it, I'm really in it, stay with my business in my
Mind, you with these wishes, that's how I'm driven, now I'm
Off, I'm working harder, back where I started, I've been
Gone, I've been lost, I'm surely parted and my
Patience growin' thin, there ain't nowhere left to hide
I need this more than anything I'm graduating right beside the tide
My brother, my family, they all just stay alive
Drinkin' out the bottle now I'm roamin' on this high
In it, in it, in it, listen, really fuckin' listen
I ain't stop and say it, trippin', gettin' what I'm gettin'
Mama love me so you know I'm gonna make her proud
And there ain't no way that you're gonna stop me now
So who gon' stop me now? Who gon' stop me now?
Who gon' stop me now? Who gon' stop me now?
Who gon' stop me now? Who gon' stop me now?
Who can stop me now?
I been here, I been really here
Had no fear, baby had no fear
I been here, I been really here
Had no fear, baby had no fear
I've been lost, I've been lost in the sauce
I've been lost, I've been lost in the sauce
I've been lost, I've been lost in the sauce
Had no fear, baby had no fear
I been here, I been really here
Had no fear, baby had no fear
I been here, I been really here
Had no fear, baby had no fear
I've been lost, I've been lost in the sauce
I've been lost, I've been lost in the sauce
I've been lost, I've been lost in the sauce
Had no fear, baby had no fear
Had no fear
Had no fear
Had no fear
