Tell me who you are
Your father has forsaken you
Left you with those scars
My hope is that you'll make it through
Hate must never win
Even when we're worlds apart
Your love is not a sin
Even if it's hard
Even when I'm far
I will always be there

Hold on my dear
I'm coming home
Don't let your fears
Take control
I can finally hear
Her message loud and clear
Hold on my dear
I'm coming home

Transmission from the stars
A message from the atmosphere
Etched into my heart
Your purpose there is still unclear
The ghost of you lives on
Through everything I see and touch
And even when you're gone
Even if it's hard
Even when I'm far
I will always be there

Hold on my dear
I'm coming home
Don't let your fears
Take control
I can finally hear
Her message loud and clear
Hold on my dear
I'm coming home

A fallen angel is what you are
Your father has forsaken you
Left you with those scars
(Transmission override complete)
My hope is that you make it through (Five)
Hate must never win (Four)
Even when we're worlds apart (Three)
Your love is not a sin (Two)
Even if it's hard (One)
(Initiating self-destruct sequence now)

Hold on my dear
I'm coming home
Don't let your fears
Take control
I can finally hear
Her message loud and clear
Hold on my dear
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
(Hold on my dear, I'm coming home)
