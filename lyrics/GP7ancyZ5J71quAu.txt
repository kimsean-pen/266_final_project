You've got the lot to burn
A shelve of pig-smothered cries
Is there a spirit that spits
Upon the exit of signs?

Is anybody there? (Spines in a row)
These steps keep on growing long (Spite as an arrow)
Bayonet trials rust, propellers await

No
Nobody is heard
Rowing sheep smiles for the dead

Nobody is heard

An antiquated home
Afloat with engines on mute
Sui generis ships spined around the yard

Is anybody there? (Spines in a row)
These craft only multiply (Spite as an arrow)
At the nape of ruins rust propellers await

No
Nobody is heard
Compass wilting in the wind

Nobody is heard
Rowing sheep smile for the dead

Transoceanic depth in this earth
In this cenotaph

Lash of one thousand eyebrows clicking
Counting the toll
Counting the toll

You've got the lot to burn
A shelve of pig-smothered cries
Is there a spirit that spits
Upon the exit of signs?

Is anybody there? (Spines in a row)
These steps keep on growing long (Spite as an arrow)
Bayonet trials rust, propellers await

No
Nobody is heard
Compass wilting in the wind

Nobody is heard
Rowing sheep smile for the dead

Transoceanic depth in this earth
In this cenotaph

Carpel jets
Hit the ground
Carpel jets
Hit the ground
Carpel jets
Hit the ground
Carpel jets
Hit the ground

Lash of one thousand eyebrows clicking
Counting the toll
Counting the toll
Lash of one thousand eyebrows clicking
Counting the toll
Counting the toll
