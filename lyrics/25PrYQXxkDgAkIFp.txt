I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You ever need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure of that

God only knows what I'd be without you
If you should ever leave me
The life would still go on, believe me
The world would show nothing to me
So what good would live into me?

God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
If you should ever leave me
The life would still go on, believe me
The world would show nothing to me
So what good would live into me?

God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
