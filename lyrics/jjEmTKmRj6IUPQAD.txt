La, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da
Oh, oh yeah

Now you told me on a Sunday
That it wasn't gonna work
I tried to cry myself to sleep
'Cause it was supposed to hurt

We sat next to the fire
As the flame was burning out
I knew what you were thinking
Before you'd say it aloud

Don't say you're sorry
'Cause I'm not even breaking
You're not worth the time that this is taking

I knew better
Than to let you break my heart
This soul you'll never see again
Won't be showing scars

You still love her
I can see it in your eyes
The truth is all that I can hear
Every time you lie

Every time you lie
Every time you lie

I woke up the next morning
With a smile on my face
And a long list of gentlemen
Happy to take your place

Less trashier, much classier
Than who you proved to be
How longs it gonna take before
You see that she's no me
Oh, no

I knew better
Than to let you break my heart
This soul you'll never see again
Won't be showing scars
Oh, no, no

You still love her
I can see it in your eyes
The truth is all that I can hear
Every time you lie

At night, awake
I will be sleeping till morning breaks
That's the price you pay
For your mistake
Goodbye to dreams

So don't say you're sorry
'Cause I'm not gonna listen

I knew better
Than to let you break my heart
This soul you'll never see again
Won't be showing scars
Oh, no, no

You still love her
I can see it in your eyes
The truth is all that I can hear
Every time you lie, oh

Every time you lie
Don't say you're sorry
Every time you lie
Don't say you're sorry, oh

The truth is all that I can hear
Every time you lie
