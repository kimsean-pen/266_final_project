Well, maybe I'm a crook for stealing your heart away
And maybe I'm a crook for not caring for it
Yeah, maybe I'm a bad, bad, bad... bad person
Well, baby I know

And these fingertips
Will never run through your skin
Those bright blue eyes

Can't only meet mine across the room
Filled with people that are less important than you
'Cause you love, love, love
When you know I can't love you
You love, love, love
When your know I can't love you
You love, love, love
When you know I can't love you

So I think it's best
We both forget
Before we dwell on it

The way you held me so tight
All through the night
Til it was near morning
'Cause you love, love, love
When you know I can't love you
You love, love, love
When you know I can't love you
You love, love, love
When you know I can't love you

'Cause you love, love, love
When you know I can't love you
You love, love, love
When your know I can't love you
You love, love, love
When you know I can't love you
