Ba-bup bup bup ba-da-da
Da-dup dup dup da-da-da
We're all going
We're all going

Well, the lampshade's on fire
When the lights went out
The room lit up and we ran about
This is what I really call a party now
Pack up our cars, move to the next town

Well, the lampshade's on fire
When the lights go out
This is what I really call a party now
Well, fear makes us really, really run around
But this one's done so where to now?

Our eyes are open and our shirt off
You all know what I'm talking about
Chained up my eyebrows while I fall on the ground
So I won't look surprised right now

Pack up again, and to the next place
Where we made the same mistakes
Put it up, and then chop it down
But this one's done so where to now?

Ba-bup bup bup ba-da-da
Da-dup dup dup da-da-da
We're all going
We're all going

We have scars in our bones
We'll eat your food, we'll throw the stone
This is how it's always gone
And this is how it's going to go

Well, we're the human race
We're going to party at this place and then move on

Keep it wild then make it hurt
Yeah we have scars, yeah we have bones
This is how it's always gone
And this is how it's going to go

As our feelings are getting hurt
Well, we want you to do the work
Our ass looks great inside jeans
Well, we want a dressed-up party queen

This is how it's always gone
And this is how it's going to be
So let's move on

Lamps on fire right looking up
Looking towards the heavens
Towards the heavens above
Waiting for the magic when the sound is played
We'll push, push, push, push, push it to the floor

Spend some time to float in outer space
Find another party, make the same mistakes
Our mind's so shattered when we plan to go
Waiting for the sound as we find another globe

Until we're moving on
Better find another one because this one's gone
Waiting for the magic when the sound is blown
We'll push, push, push, push, push a little forward

Ba-bup bup bup ba-da-da
Da-dup dup dup da-da-da
We're all going
We're all going up

Ba-bup bup bup ba-da-da
Da-dup dup dup da-da-da
We're all going
We're all going up
