I'm in love with an angel, heaven forbid
Made me a believer, with the touch of her skin

I'd go to hell and back with you
Still lost in what we found.
Worlds apart we were the same
Until we hit the ground

Maybe I'm crazy maybe I'm weak
Maybe I'm blinded by what I see
You wanted a soldier
But it wasn't me
Because I could never set you free
So fly on your own
It's time I let you go
Go

I'm in love with an angel, who's afraid of the light
Whose halo is broken but the fight in her eyes?
Walls were built to keep us safe until they're crashin down
Worlds apart we were the same
Until you hit the ground

Maybe I'm crazy maybe I'm weak
Maybe I'm blinded by what I see
You wanted a soldier
But it wasn't me
Because I could never set you free
So fly on your own
It's time I let you go
Go

The walls are built to keep us safe until they're crashing down
Worlds apart we were the same
Until you hit the ground

Maybe I'm crazy maybe I'm weak
Maybe I'm blinded by what I see
You wanted a soldier
But it wasn't me
Because I could never set you free
So fly on your own
It's time I let you go

So fly on your own
It's time I let you go
Go
