A penny for your thoughts, my love
A swinging door
A penny for your thoughts
They try to jump me
A penny for your thoughts, my love
They're spaghetti
They possess me
I'm trying to be a thought killer
They come back to bite me
A penny for your thoughts, my love
They court disaster
I'm trying to be a thought killer
A penny for your thoughts, my love
You'll forget me
Tying round pieces of string
To run amok
I'm sending out choirs of angels
Tying round pieces of string
To run amok
You got me
You got me back
To bite me
A penny for your thoughts
