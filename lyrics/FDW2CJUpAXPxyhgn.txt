You've got them all by the balls
causin' waterfalls, stone walls, bar brawls
Common stalls that cause 'em all
To you they crawl, body sprawl
Smokin' Pall Malls, close call, stand tall
Doll, you make them feel so small
(And they love it)
The boys wanna be her (The boys)
The girls wanna be her (The girls) The boys wanna be her (The boys)
I wanna be her
Yes I do
The way you rock, don't stop
Girl, you got the chops
Flip flop, she bop, self-taught
You look so hot
Are you conceived, kids receive
Crawling up her sleeve
Parents bleed, can't conceive
That indeed we'll never leave
(And we love it)
The boys wanna be her (The boys)
The girls wanna be her (The girls) The boys wanna be her (The boys)
I wanna be her
So do you

Listen up Voices scatter
Listen up Voices scatter
Listen up Voices scatter
Listen up Voices scatter
Listen up Voices scatter
The boys wanna be her
The girls wanna be her (scatter) (Scatter)
The Boys
The Girls
