Put a dead cat on the railroad tracks
Wolf bains blooming by the tressel
Get the eyeball of a rooster
Stones from a ditch
Wash 'em down with bilge water
Say you'll never snitch
Take the buttons from a yellow jacket
Feather from a buzzard
Blood from the bounty hunters cold black heart
Catch the tears of a widow
In a thimble made of glass
Tell your mama and your papa
They can kiss your ass
Poison all the water in the wishin' well
Hang all them scarecrows from a sycamore tree
Burn down them honeymoons
Put 'em in a pillow case
Wait next to the switch blades at the amusement park for me
Strangle all the christmas carols
Scratch out all you prayers
Tie 'em up with barbed wire
And push them down the stairs
I'll whittle you a pistol
Keepin' nightmares off your blinds
Them sunsabitches always seem to sneak up from behind
Syphon all the gas from your daddys pickup truck
Fill up Jonny's T-Bird
I got a couple bucks
Put on little perfume and ribbon in your hair
Careful that you don't wake up the hounds
Tear a bolt of lightning
Off the side of the sky
Throw her in the cedar chest
If you want me to tell you why
Bring the gear shift knob from a 49 mere
And lay down here beside me
Let me hold you in the dirt
Your gonna tremble
Tear the throat out of the night
Sink your teeth into my shoulder
Dig your nails into my back
Tell that little girl to let go of my sleeve
You'll be a woman when I catch you
C'mon baby, fall in love with me

With my double barrel shotgun
A whole box of shells
We'll celebrate the 4 of July
We'll do 100mph
Spendin' someone elses dough
Drive all the way to Reno
On the wrong side of the road
Wrong side of the road
On the wrong side of the road
Wrong side of the road
Wrong side of the road
Wrong side of the road
