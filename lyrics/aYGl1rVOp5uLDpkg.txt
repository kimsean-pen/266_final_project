If you feel like singin' a song
And you want other people to sing along
Just sing what you feel
Don't let anyone say it's wrong

And if you're trying to paint a picture
But you're not sure which colors belong
Just paint what you see
Don't let anyone say it's wrong

If you're strung out like a kite
Or stuck awake in the night
It's alright to be frightened

When there's a light
What light?
And there's a light
What light?
There's a light
White light
Inside of you

If you think you might need somebody
To pick you up when you drag
Don't lose sight of yourself
Don't let anyone change your bag

And if the whole world is singing your songs
And all of your paintings have been hung
Just remember what was yours
Is everyone's from now on

And that's not wrong or right
But you can struggle with it all you like
You don't have to get uptight

When there's a light
What light?
There's a light
What light?
There's a light
White light
There's a light
White light
There's a light
One light
There's a light
White light
There's a light
One light
There's a light
White light
There's a light
One light
There's a light
White light
There's a light
White light inside of you

There's a light
White light
There's a light
White light
There's a light
White light
There's a light
One light
