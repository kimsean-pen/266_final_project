Letting loose on the streets
On the prowl looking for meat
We're always out and out for you
Better watch out we're coming for you

Evil's staring in your eyes
Your time is here
Breaking out of our cage
We smell your fear

...
These fangs are sharp will tear your flesh
With matted coats and rotten breath
Demon dogs from the tomb

Torn right outta the bitch's womb
Evil's staring in your eyes
Your time is here
Breaking out of our cage

We smell your fear we mell your fear

Wild dogs are hunting, prepare! we're on the attack
Rabid unleashed and wicked we're on your tracks

Wild dogs are hunting, the pack is on the loose
Die or kill, now it's your time to choose
...
Torn right through, through the devil's gate
...
And with one sharp bite

The blood runs down your face
...
Our thirst for your juices will never be quenched
...
And your pulmonary's pumping steady out through your neck
...

Don't cross our path
Brains set to kill
Bred into violence
it's time to kill
No chains could hold us
We couldn't be stopped
Mauling our victims until they all drop
Until they all drop
We are the
Wild dogs
wild dogs
wild dogs
...
wild dogs
wild dogs
wild dogs
