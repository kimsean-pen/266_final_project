Sucking on a sour sweet
Blisters on your tongue
Sucking on a sour sweet
Sitting on your thumb

Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it

Sucking on a sour sweet
Waiting for a train
Looking at the information
Ready to complain
Thinking back on better days
How it used to be
Pull yourself together boy
You're only twenty three (Come on)

What are you gonna' do about it?
What are you gonna' do about it?
What are you gonna' do about it?
Oh, what's a boy to do?

Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it

Chewing on a razor blade
Pissing in the wind
Laughter in a canister
Breakfast in a tin
Maybe you should put yourself
In someone else's shoes
Try hard not to dwell upon
Decisions that you choose (Come on)

What are you gonna' do about it?
What are you gonna' do about it?
What are you gonna' do about it?
Oh, what's a boy to do?

Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it

What are you gonna' do about it?
What are you gonna' do about it?
What are you gonna' do about it?
Oh, what's a boy to do?

Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it out
Spit it
