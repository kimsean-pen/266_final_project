You look like a classic, took yo' time and crafted this
(God damn I swear to God)
Moving through these chapters, booked and busy, page my shit
(Paging my shit, I know you...)
I'll hit you right back, I get sidetracked
I got side things, you know side ventures and shit
I vibrate, I'm a instrument, play into romance
Sometimes I breakdown, breakdown, breakdown, old hoopti
Gas me up, change my plug and get back in tune-tune
Squeaky clean WD-40, ounce on me with a stogie

Don't ask if I'ma pass it bitch, fuck no
I don't know you, you look like the po-po
I fly solo, no co-cap
Coconut in the duss√©, fuck a perform at
She ain't bougie, she ain't choosy, fuck on the floor mat
Chicken strips and scary movies, romance
Float like a butterfly when I'm high off the loud
Told my niggas in a minute it's gon' be our hour
I don't put my faith in man, a nigga known to be cowards
I'm a lion, I'm a Mayan, I feel like Terrence Howard
I'm like Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum and a fifty
Roll Luigi, wood stack like a tipi (Mmm)
Pretty white toe, walking on her tippy
'Cause the flow cold, ass on Mississippi (Oh)
Hit her with the crooked letter, she said Smino papi
Get on top the polo horse and ride it like a Maserati
I come from the north side, St. Louis, let me tell you 'bout it
Mama always worried about her baby when he leave the house
22s on the Monte Carlo, Remy in the cupholder
With the semi in the stroller, baby seat
And the back this for safety he just holdin' trivia
You never know who might be lurking over shoulders
Man I thank the Lord every time I see my niggas
Not being dramatic, life cinematic
This one feel like a classic, you look like a classic
Might pull up in a classic

You look like a classic, took yo' time and crafted this
Moving through these chapters, booked and busy, page my shit
I'll hit you right back, I get sidetracked
I got side things, you know side ventures and shit
I vibrate, I'm a instrument, play into romance, huh
Sometimes I breakdown, breakdown, breakdown, old hoopti
Gas me up, change my plug and get back in tune-tune
Squeaky clean WD-40, ounce on me with a stogie
