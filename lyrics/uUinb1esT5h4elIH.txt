Stuck here in the middle of nowhere
With a head ache and a heavy heart
Well nothing was going quite right here
And I'm tired, I can't play my part

Come on, come on
Oh, what a state I'm in?
Come on, come on
Why won't it just sink in?
The help is just around the corner for us

Oh, my head just won't stop achin'
I'm sat here lickin' my wounds
I'm shattered but it really doesn't matter
'Cause my rescue is gonna be here soon

Come on, come on
Oh, what a state I'm in?
Come on, come on
Why won't it just sink in?
The help is just around the corner for us
The help is just around the corner for us
Oh, the help is just around the corner for us
