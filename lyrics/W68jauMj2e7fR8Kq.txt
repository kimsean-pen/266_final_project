Frozen in silence
Facing it alone
Gotta keep my cool
Make em think I'm made of stone

It's a game of wills we're playin
Our nerves are made of steel
Balanced on the edges of everything we feel

It's gonna take all of we've got
Just to make it through this night
Gotta feel it right through my skin
And it's cuttin like a knife

Get ready to break the ice
Feels like time is standing still
Aiming right for your heart
Ready to take another spill
Only you can make it right
You can break the ice inside of me

A single minded passion
A solitary stand
I thought I was alone
Left out in the cold again
So I'm givin you all I've got
I'm gonna make it through this night
And even though I could fall
I'm prepared to lose the fight

Get ready to break the ice
Feels like time is standing still
Aiming right for your heart
Ready to take another spill
Only you can make it right
You can break the ice

Get ready to break the ice
Feels like time is standing still
Aiming right for your heart
Ready to take another spill

Get ready to break the ice
Feels like time is standing still
Aiming right for your heart
Ready to take another spill

Get ready to break the ice.
