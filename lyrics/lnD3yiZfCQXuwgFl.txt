I'm a million lightyears
Away from you
Saved a million dried tears
Just for you

My heart is so bittersweet
It's coming alive 'cause it's so alive to pain
For good I'll let it bleed
Knowing that somewhere in time you'll feel the same

But should it bleed in vain
Shall all of my sadness be what I am to face
Until the end of days

I'm a million lightyears
Away from you
Saved a million dried tears
Just for you

How I only wish that you could hear
My rhapsody in blue
I'm a million lightyears
Away from you

Ohh, ohh, oh...
I'm hearing you crying my name
Ohh, ohh, oh...
Can you take the sorrow from me
Ohh, ohh, oh...
Or will it be all we're to see
I'm a million lightyears
Away from you

A prayer into the night
Arising from out of the void you left in me
A song across the sky
May you be carried, my little melody
And should I chant in vain
I'm willing to take all the woe and carry on
Until another dawn

I'm a million lightyears
Away from you
Saved a million dried tears
Just for you

How I only wish that you could hear
My rhapsody in blue
I'm a million lightyears
Away from you

I'm a million lightyears
Away from you
Saved a million dried tears
Just for you

How I only wish that you could hear
My rhapsody in blue
I'm a million lightyears
Away from you

Ohh, ohh, oh...
I'm hearing you crying my name
Ohh, ohh, oh...
Can you take the sorrow from me
Ohh, ohh, oh...
Or will it be all we're to see
I'm a million lightyears
Away from you
