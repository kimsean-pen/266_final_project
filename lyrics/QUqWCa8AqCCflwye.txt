I see the crystal raindrops fall
And the beauty of it all
Is when the sun comes shining through
To make those rainbows in my mind
When I think of you sometimes
And I want to spend sometime with you

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

We look for love, no time for tears
Wasted waters all that is
And it don't make flowers grow
Good things might come to those who wait
Not to those who wait too late
We got to go for all we know

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Building new castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

I hear the crystal raindrops fall
On the window down the hall
And it becomes the morning dew
Darling, when the morning comes
And I see the morning sun
I want to see the one with you

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Building big castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

Just the two of us
Yeah, just the two of us
Just the two of us
Better get it together baby
Just the two of us
Just the two of us

Just the two of us
We can make it
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
We can make it
Just the two of us
