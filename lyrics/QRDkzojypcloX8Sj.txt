I can't control my feet
I feel like movin'
Follow my lead 'cause baby I'm groovin'
Two hands in the air signal a table for two
Don't bet on me 'cause baby I'm losing
losong, losing, losing

Oh don't mind me I'm impossible
I'll rip your heart out and I'll eat it whole
O la la la baby say it with me
Yes yes yes

Oh don't mind me I'm impossible
I'll rip your heart out and I'll eat it whole
O la la la baby say it with me
Yes yes yes
Yes yes yes

When I move you can tell just by the way I walk
Things are going to work out well
Yes yes yes

When I move you can tell just by the way I walk

Yes yes yes

Oh don't mind me I'm impossible
