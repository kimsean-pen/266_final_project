Waiting as I'm wanting to

Speaking as I'm spoken to
Changing to your point of view
Fading as I follow you
A boyish notion of false emotion

These words are spoken despite my love
A fool's devotion was set in motion
My eyes are open now
It's a glass cage so I can't pretend

You hide beneath the physical
I see it coming but I can't defend
You cut so deep, my belief is gone
My belief is gone, my belief is
Tell me what I want to say
Save me for another day

Break me, it's the game you play
Hate me as I turn away
A boyish notion of false emotion
These words are spoken despite my love
A fool's devotion was set in motion
My eyes are open now
It's a glass cage so I can't pretend
You hide beneath the physical
I see it coming but I can't defend
You cut so deep, my belief is gone
My belief is gone, my belief is gone
My belief is gone, my belief is
It's a glass cage so I can't pretend
You hide beneath the physical
I see it coming but I can't defend
You cut so deep, my belief is gone
My belief is gone, my belief is gone
My belief is gone, my belief is
