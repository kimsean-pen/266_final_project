Tsavo
No peace

Welcome to disaster
Plagued men reign disorder
Shredded all life with frailty, no peace
Hatred burns like fire at the core of desire
Flesh is all that we live for

It's human to believe that you're
safe with these four walls surrounding
But it all went wrong in the darkest days
We'll take everything away as light disintegrates

Over and over again you'll look back on the crippling doubt
It's a miracle how
You made it out by the skin of your teeth with the souls of dead men
Snapping at your feet

Come on lick those lips so you can taste it
Go on close your eyes and feel sick
'Cause when the sun drips down into blood,
That's how you'll know the devil has come to Tsavo

To eat the heart of God and kiss off the skin
to drink of warm blood until all life has left
Refined pure evil
So make no mistake
A quick death is the only saving grace

Right here, right now
We can bury the hope of reaching home
The bullets will run out eventually
There is no escaping the inevitable
The downfall
Two devils could never rise on broken wings, but we misunderstood
We're back to back, hiding in dirt
You pray but God's not answering

There's nothing left, reach out, touch the sun
For new beginnings for our loved ones
Search for peace in a world drenched in blood
Embrace the end

Over and over again you'll look back on the crippling doubt
It's a miracle how
You made it out by the skin of your teeth with the souls of dead men
Snapping at your feet

Come on lick those lips so you can taste it
Go on close your eyes and feel sick
'Cause when the sun drips down into blood,
That's how you'll know the devil
Has come to Tsavo

To eat the heart of God
Look at you now
Look at you now
Look at you now
Open your eyes you're a fucking disaster
Look at you now, motherfucker look!
Welcome to a place of slaughter
