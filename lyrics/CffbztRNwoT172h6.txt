Oh mother
Are there horses on the moon?
I saw them last night
Through the looking glass tube

One horse was red
The other was blue
Running and rolling
Where the moonflowers bloom

Oh mother
Are there tigers in the sea?
Tumbling and swimming
Like dolphins, they breathe

Happy and graceful
At the bottom of the sea
Playing like children
And they look just like me

Oh mother
Are there fish in the trees?
Casting their fire
Eating the leaves

Through the window i saw them
Flying so free
But I am in here
How can this be?

Oh mother
Is there life here beyond?
A place in the clouds
After i'm gone

Where I can paint
Play and belong
Sing with my friends
And they're singing along

There's a crack in the window
An open door
There's a place in the hollow
Across the moor

I see the end of the morning
My dying fear
It's the eternal dawning
Oh, take me there

Oh mother
Are there horses on the moon?
I saw them last night
Through the looking glass tube

One horse was red
The other was blue
Running and rolling
Where the moonflowers bloom

Oh mother
Are there tigers in the sea?
Tumbling and swimming
Like dolphins, they breathe

Happy and graceful
At the bottom of the sea
Playing like children
And they look just like me

I feel the teardrops falling
I hear the moonhorse calling
I see the black moon rivers
To the night I'm given
