I'm sick, I think I'm on the brink
Turn the TV up so that I can fall asleep
And drown out all my thoughts
The ones in which you love to haunt me

Stoned, feet on the cement
Cursing at my cell phone,
The way to your apartment
Pressing my ear to the door
Oh, I can hear that you're not alone, no

Do you think fate is just a lie
We tell ourselves
To help us fall asleep at night?

I'm waking up sideways, laying in the driveway
Trying to forget the thought of you
I'm drowning my sorrow even though it's hollow
Taking tequila shots at noon
That's why I followed you home
Even though it's insane
Watch you silence your phone
Whenever it shows my name

Tell me a beautiful lie
Tell me it's only for tonight
Tell me he's only your friend
Say you remember when

I used to call you miss and you kissed me on the neck
Used to call me baby
Now you never call me back
I swear it's this game that we play,
If only you would see it that way

Do you think we could spend the night indulging ourselves
Just to recall what it was like?

I'm waking up sideways, laying in the driveway,
Trying to forget the thought of you
I'm drowning my sorrow even though it's hollow
Taking tequila shots at noon
That's why I followed you home even though it's insane
Watch you silence your phone whenever it shows my name

I can't let you go
I can't let you go

I'm waking up sideways, laying in the driveway
Trying to forget the thought of you
I'm drowning my sorrow even though it's hollow
Taking tequila shots at noon
That's why I followed you home even though it's insane
Watch you silence your phone whenever it shows my name
