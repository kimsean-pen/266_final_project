Go
Deep beneath the skin
In the back of my mind
I am relieved from all color
Letting my thoughts stray
Swallowing a conscious life by given right
I am the ground that I'm buried in

By the dirt under my nails
Nine years poison runs through my veins
And still it's dark beneath the sunlight

Straight suffering
Twitching eyes, yeah
Contest the sanity
Murder the innocence
Murder the innocence

This is death by the gallow
I give you nine for hell
Murder the innocence
Nine for hell
Imminent demise draw the life out of my blood
This is nine for hell
What is there left to say?
Just cut my tongue out

Consume the pills that make me bitter
Facing my death without the sedative
Biting down on fear didn't make things clearer
You think I'm rich but there's nothing left

Consume the pills that make me bitter
Facing my death without the sedative
Biting down on fear didn't make things clearer
You think I'm rich but there's nothing left

Nine years poison runs through my veins
And still it's dark beneath the sunlight
We're counting casualties

Nine for hell
Imminent demise draw the life out of my blood
This is nine for hell
What is there left to say?
Just cut my tongue out
Nine for hell
Nine for hell
Nine for hell
Go
