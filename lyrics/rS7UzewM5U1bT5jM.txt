I'll be your jonny on the spot, I'll be your jonny on the spot
My daddy died, left me all he's got, I'll be your jonny on the spot

I get up early in the morn, I get up early in the morn
I slop the pigs, Momma shucks the corn, I get up early in the morn

I got a Chevy with a Mopar cam, I got a Chevy with a Mopar cam
I got a Chevy with a-Mopar-cam, I'll be your jonny on the spot

I'm goin' down, I'm goin' down, I'm goin' down, I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down, I'm goin' down, I'll be your jonny on the spot

(Repeat first verse)
