It's come to take from the ripe (from the ripe, from the ripe)
It feels so still, I could just die, just die
It's come to reach up inside (up inside, up inside)
Oh, how the blood stains well on white

Ooh-ah-ooh, the coral fang
Sinking in to make you well
Ooh-ah-ooh, the coral fang
Sinking in to make you ill

It's come to rape what you hide (what you hide, what you hide)
It fills the years with reprise, disgust, disguise
I'll burn my own funeral pyre
And from your mouth I will rise, I rise, I...

Ooh-ah-ooh, the coral fang
Sinking in to make you well
Ooh-ah-ooh, the coral fang
Sinking in to make you ill

When the fang sinks down in (sinks down in)
Makes your eyes white and roll right into him
When the coral shaves the skin (shaves the skin)
Disease is cheap, scars are polished clean

Ooh-ah-ooh, the coral fang
Sinking in to make you well
Ooh-ah-ooh, the coral fang
Sinking in to take at will
