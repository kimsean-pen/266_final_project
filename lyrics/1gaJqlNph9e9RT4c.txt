turn your ugly face
are you so surprised to see me
yeah I was your little childhood playground toy

and if I remember
yeah if I do remember rightly
I said the tables would be turned around boy

who's getting scared now
tell me, tell me how does it feel
it feels so good from where I'm standing

the only times in my life
the sun was meant to shine for me
you made it pour down, pour down with tears of rain

dug my pride with a knife
encaged by your obsession with me
time for some mental torture and screams of justified pain

so ya gonna chase me now boy
yeah ya gonna corner me now boy
you think ya gonna threaten me now boy
somehow I don't think so

yeah ya gonna stamp me down now boy
yeah ya gonna crush me down now boy
you think ya gonna threaten me now boy
well somehow I don't think so

who's getting scared now,
tell me, tell me how does it feel
it feels so good from where I'm standing

yeah you're getting scared now, piggy,
go ahead and squeal
it sounds so nice from where I'm standing.

who's getting scared now,
tell me, tell me how does it feel
it feels so good from where I'm standing

yeah you're getting scared now, piggy,
go ahead and squeal
it sounds so nice from where I'm standing
from where I'm standing

who's getting scared?
who's getting scared now?
