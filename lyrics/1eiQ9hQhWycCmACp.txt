You, you are so beautiful

Used to be
You and me
Love like no other

The world around
Could fall apart
But we had each other

Saw you walking you were smiling
And it hit me like the first time
Feels like yesterday has come and gone
But nothing's changed when I look at you

You, you are so beautiful
You, you are so beautiful

And now I
I just want you to know
That after all this time
You're still the one

So hard sometimes
Love on the line
But we said forever
Sailing on
Through the storms
We held together

And I
I just want you to know
That after all this time
You're still the one

You, you are so beautiful
You, you are so beautiful

And I
I just want you to know
That after all this time
You're still the one

You, you are so beautiful
You, you are so beautiful.
