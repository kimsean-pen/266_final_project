We're chasing the sun
We don't need anyone
We smile when you scream
You don't mean anything
We're chasing the sun
We don't need anyone
We smile when you scream
You don't mean anything

Enter the shogun
Backing up for no one
I'm about to flow one
Better watch your back, son
Something like a heart attack
Needle in a haystack
Up goes the drum track
We'll never ever look back

(It goes like, oh)
Rocket shot to your system
(Oh) Never gonna play the fucking victim
(Oh) Shut your mouth and just listen
You're missing the point, this is the joint
Like, oh
We're pushing up
We're pushing up
We're pushing up

We're chasing the sun
We don't need anyone
We smile when you scream
You don't mean anything
We're chasing the sun
We don't need anyone
We smile when you scream
You don't mean anything

Break off the kill switch
Don't you want to rock the rich?
Dump him in a cold ditch
Everybody hates a snitch
I'm running with the money bags
Switching out the toe tags
Wasting the mean drag
Listening to Black Flag

(It goes like, oh)
Rocket shot to your system
(Oh) Never gonna play the fucking victim
(Oh) Shut your mouth and just listen
You're missing the point, this is the joint
Like, oh
We're pushing up
We're pushing up
We're pushing up

We're chasing the sun
We don't need anyone
We smile when you scream
You don't mean anything
We're chasing the sun
We don't need anyone
We smile when you scream
You don't mean anything

(It goes like, oh)
Rocket shot to your system
(Oh) Never gonna play the fucking victim
(Oh) Shut your mouth and just listen
You're missing the point, this is the joint
Like, oh
We're pushing up
We're pushing up
We're pushing up

We're chasing the sun
We don't need anyone
We smile when you scream
You don't mean anything
We're chasing the sun
We don't need anyone
We smile when you scream
You don't mean anything
