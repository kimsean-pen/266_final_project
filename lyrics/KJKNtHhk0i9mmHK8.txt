Fight, fight, fight
Fighting the world every single day
Fighting the world for the right to play
Heavy metal in my brain
I'm fighting for metal 'cause it's here to stay
Fighting, fighting, fighting the world
I've been fighting the world
Fighting, fighting, fighting the world
I've been fighting
Fight for a living, fighting the world
Fight for a living, fighting the world
Fight for a living, fighting the world
Fight
Now people keep asking if we're gonna change
I look 'em in the eye tell 'em no way
Strips on a tiger don't wash away
Manowar's made of steel not clay
Fighting, fighting, fighting the world
I've been fighting the world
Fighting, fighting, fighting the world
I've been fighting
Fight for a living, fighting the world
Fight for a living, fighting the world
Fight for a living, fighting the world
Fight, fight yeah
See my brother standing by my side
Only got one thing on our mind
Radio playing this nation wide
Turn it up louder 'til we all get fried
Fighting, fighting, fighting the world
I've been fighting the world
Fighting, fighting, fighting the world
I've been fighting
Fight, fighting the world
Fight, fighting the world, yeah
Fight, fighting the world
Fight, fighting the world
Fight for a living, fighting the world
Fight for a living, fighting the world
Fight for a living, fighting the world
