You never go
You're always here (suffocating me)
Under my skin
I cannot run away

Fading slowly
I give it all to you
Letting go of me
Reaching as I fall
I know it's already over now
Nothing left to lose
Loving you again

I know it's already over, already over now
My best defense is
Running from you (cost me everything)

I can't resist
Take all you want from me
Breaking slowly
I give it all to you
Letting go of me
Reaching as I fall
I know it's already over now

Nothing left to lose
Loving you again
I know it's already over, already over now!
You're all I'm reaching for

It's already over
All I'm reaching for!
It's already over now

I give it all to you
I offer up my soul
It's already over, already over now!
Give it all to you
Letting go of me
Reaching as I fall
I know it's already over now
Nothing left to lose
Loving you again!
I know it's already over now!
It's already over now!
I know it's already over, already over
