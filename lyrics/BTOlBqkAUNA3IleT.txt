The thing I like about you
The way you do what you do
The thing I like about you
God or the devil alone could not have made you up
Two must have worked as one together
So good just want to eat you up
Let me like the real thing
Lick your sticky fingers boy and sing for your dinner sing

Come on pretty baby make me lose my mind
Everybody get together gonna make love shine

Do you know what it is to feel the light of love inside you
And all the darkness falls away
If you feel the way I feel then I believe we have the answer
That I've been searching for tonight
Love me baby love me baby shake me like a monkey baby
Forever I'm yours yours yours yeah
Forever I am

I I I can't stop thinking about you
Yeah yeah yeah
Why would I wannt to
I like my coffee with toast and jelly
But I'd rather be licking from your back to your belly
I think that I'm going to

CHORUS

Cigarettes and coffee broken hearts and being lonely
Little girls and ponies are the things that go together
Yes and no you have to choose Romeo and Juliet
The hangman and his noose
You and me we go good together

Kiss kiss make a wish
Hoping it comes true
But I ain't waiting for the world to change
Gonna change the world for you

Come on pretty baby make you lose your mind
Everybody get together gonna make love shine

Do you know what it is to feel the light of love inside you
And all the darkness falls away
If you feel the way I feel then I believe we have the answer
That I've been searching for tonight
Love me baby love me baby shake me like a monkey baby
Forever I'm yours yours yours yeah
Forever I am
Come on baby
Yay yay yay
Oh oh
Forever I am
Baby
Yeah
Oh oh
Forever I am

Come on everybody make me lose my mind
Everybody get together gonna make love shine
