everybody at the finish line is always crying
and ever since that day all of my best friends' been dying
i wish i could have said bye one last time
i wish i could have said hi one more time

and all my freinds are always doin drugs and getting high
we gave ourselves ten years to act like kids and fight all night
and i wish i could of fought with you one last time
you know i loved to fight with you all night

when i was a little one
i never held a single gun
and now that i am twenty i have
seen them held in all our eyes
