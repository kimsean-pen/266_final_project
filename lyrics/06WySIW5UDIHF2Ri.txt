I could stay here the rest of my life
I could be happy, never be lonely
I don't need to go looking for misery

I could surround myself with my props
Playing my part, getting caught up in a game
Some game that anyone can play
It's a game, some game that anyone can play

I could be proud of things I have done
Pretend I don't have to try to be someone
I could say that I've done it all before

I could get wiser, I could get jaded
I could remember, I could just fade away
In a game that anyone can play
It's a game, some game that anyone can play

I am so proud, I don't have to try
Never a need to justify it
When people say, "Hey, I was important too"

Memories go to reinforce
The things I have done for better or worse
It's a game that anyone can play
It's a game, some game that anyone can play

Just when you think that all your answers are so right
You'll fade away and disappear from sight
The ones who said you're great will find another way

I could be sad, I could be lonely
I could still have such friends if I had only
Didn't play the games I had to play

I was important when I was cool
Now it gets lonely playing the fool
It's a game that anyone can play
It's a game, some game that anyone can play

It's a game, some game that anyone can play
It's a game, some game that anyone can play
It's a game, some game, some game
It's a game, some game, some game

It's a game, some game, some game
It's a game, some game, some game
It's a game, some game, some game
It's a game, some game, some game
