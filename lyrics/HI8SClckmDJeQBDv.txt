From the second that we walk in
You kinda make me wanna leave
You let your eyes do the talking
It kinda makes me wanna be
Alone with you
Home with you
Little love drunk stoned with you
I need a minute
'Cause boy you're me giving the

Feels, like the tickle of the bubbles
In a bottle of cheap champagne
And it feels like I'm getting into
Trouble but I'm gonna do it anyway
And it feels like love in the morning
So good it's gonna burn
Through my body all day
What can I say
Hey
You're giving me the feels, baby
Head down to my heels, baby

You don't gotta light a candle
You don't have to set the mood
What you gotta understand though
I'm already into you
It's chemistry
Meant to be
Incomprehensibly
Tangled up in it
Yeah boy you're giving me the

Feels, like the tickle of the bubbles
In a bottle of cheap champagne
And it feels like I'm getting into
Trouble but I'm gonna do it anyway
And it feels like love in the morning
So good it's gonna burn
Through my body all day
What can I say
Hey
You're giving me the feels, baby
Head down to my heels, baby

I need a
I need a minute
I'm tangled in it
I'm kinda
I'm kinda caught up
You give me all the

I need a
I need a minute
I'm tangled in it
I'm kinda
I'm kinda caught up
You give me all the

Feels, like the tickle of the bubbles
In a bottle of cheap champagne
And it feels like I'm getting into
Trouble but I'm gonna do it anyway
And it feels like love in the morning
So good it's gonna burn
Through my body all day
What can I say
Hey
You're giving me the feels, baby
Head down to my heels, baby

You're giving me the feels, baby
