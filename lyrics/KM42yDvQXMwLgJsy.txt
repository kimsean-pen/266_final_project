Sick of all that we have to be in this life
Gimme all that you have, gimme what you like
Waiting here for a fool to begin his life
And you, you try to remember
Flipping coins from a tin till he feels the night
And you, you try to remember

We're part of a, we're part of a
We're part of a crazy world
We're part of a, we're part of a
We're part of a crazy world

We're part of a, we're part of a
We're part of a crazy world
We're part of a, we're part of a
We're part of a crazy world

Gimme time to reflect, gimme all we know
Holding hands on the street where the lights are low
You and me wanting more but we'll never know
And you, you try to remember
What it means in a world where it's never slow
And you, you try to remember

We're part of a, we're part of a
We're part of a crazy world
We're part of a, we're part of a
We're part of a crazy world

We're part of a, we're part of a
We're part of a crazy world
We're part of a, we're part of a
We're part of a crazy world

Gimme all that you have, gimme what you like
Waiting here for a fool to begin his life
And you, you try to remember
Flipping coins from a tin till he feels the night
And you, you try to remember

We're part of a, we're part of a
We're part of a crazy world
We're part of a, we're part of a
We're part of a crazy world

We're part of a, we're part of a
We're part of a crazy world
