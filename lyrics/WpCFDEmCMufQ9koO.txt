Oh well the world never seemed bigger,
Than the summer of '98,
Living out in the suburbs,
Planning my escape,
I grew my hair to my shoulders,
Formed a band with a couple of friends,
We called ourselves The Devils Playhouse,
Influence is like grease in the bin (?),

And we'd sing and play,
Simple three-chord rock and roll,
And miles away,
The other kids would disco,
But we're making our own way out,
Yeah we're making our own way out,

Well we'd practice every week in my bedroom,
While my parents were working in town,
And one morning in our school assembly,
Played a cover of 'Don't Let Me Down',
The performance was nervous and awkward,
But the passion was real and profound,
And the kids in the audience laughing,
While the band just stared at the ground,

What a victory, for the kids who believe in rock and roll,
I know, for me, that performance lives and never grows old,
But we're making our own way out,
Yeah we're making our own way out,

Well I'd give it all back just to do it again,
I turn back time, be with my friends,
Yeah I'd give it all back just to do it again,
Turn back time, be with my friends,
Yeah I'd give it all back just to do it again,
Turn back time, be with my friends,
Yeah I'd give it all back just to do it again,
Turn back time, be with my friends, tonight.
