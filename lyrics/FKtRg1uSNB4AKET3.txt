My eyes has never seen someone so beautiful
So much charm, so much class
You're the first thought of each day

So appealing you are, you move through me
Such a natural feeling
And oh, please don't take it away

I can get caught up when I see you
You're so beautiful
I can get caught up when I see you
You're so beautiful

I have received a love that's so divine
So innocent and so pure
You make each moment stand still

And you took care of my heart ever so gently
I can never repay you, no
Your desires, I'm here to fulfill, yeah

I can get caught up when I see you
You're so beautiful
I can get caught up when I see you
You're so beautiful, oh

You, you are, you
You're more than a dream come true
You, you are, you
Beautiful, beautiful

I can get caught up when I see you
You're so beautiful
I can get caught up when I see you
You're so beautiful

I can get caught up when I see you
You're so beautiful
I can get caught up when I see you
You're so beautiful

So caught up, I can get caught up
Oh no, ooh
