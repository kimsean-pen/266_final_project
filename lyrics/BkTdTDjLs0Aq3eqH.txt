Lung of love, leaves me breathless,
Tongue of fool, lap me in enmity,
Four walled secret lies among the hessian,
And a flicker of the future,
Could've saved the cindered sister,
And I'm motioning still, they stand inside me,
And moments until, the one I leave.

Colourless I kiss her cold forehead I feel life,
Loose it in a minute and the ones to come feel too far to care,
And I'm motioning still they stand inside me,
And moments until the one I leave.

People concertina to my private magic lantern move for me,
With the senses all inclusive,
In the theatre of triggered memories.

I'm motioning still they stand inside me,
And moments until the one I leave,
I'm motioning still they stand inside me,
And moments until the one I leave,
The moments until the one I leave,
The one I leave,
The one I leave,
The one I leave,
Motioning still,
The one I leave.
