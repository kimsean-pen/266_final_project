It started again
Claimin' a friend
I couldn't be
I've never been
I'm all alone
Out in the cold
I'll never know
Your sugarcoat
You're ready to blow
You're ready to go
But I'll never know
Your sugarcoat
Is just as sweet as I am

(Look)
Look what you did
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red
(Look)
What did you say?
Willing to drown in a tidal wave
(Look)
Take me away

Let me believe that you're on your way
(Look)
Look what you did
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red
I'm on the floor
Battered and bored
You got a taste
I can't ignore
I'm all alone
Out in the cold
I'll never know
Your sugarcoat
You're ready to blow

You're ready to go
But I'll never know
Your sugarcoat
Is just as sweet as I am
(Look)
Look what you did
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red
(Look)

What did you say?
Willing to drown in a tidal wave
(Look)
Take me away
Let me believe that you're on your way
(Look)
Look what you did
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red

(Look)
Look what you did
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red
(Look)
What did you say?
Willing to drown in a tidal wave
(Look)
Take me away
Let me believe that you're on your way
(Look)
Look what you did
Suck on your lies 'til your eyes turn red
Red
Your eyes are red
