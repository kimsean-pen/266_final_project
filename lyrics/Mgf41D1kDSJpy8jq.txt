let meduce you
since you saw my shadow self
living underneath you
she can't resist a tickle out
i'm a girl scout
searching for the new stuff

did i mention that it melts away(allgone)
she puts a sign out
out of order (i want a building that says)
makes you strongly disobey
guiding you away
chiding you away

so quick to hide when i turn around
she will rise just to embarrass me
she likes to dance when it's dark inside
just a flashlight there
for a guide
try and catch me if you can
free and wild
watch where you stand
below the net
desire it grows and grows
like a strawberry not a rose
prickly patch don't you stand on me
squishing down
in the mud ahh!
