When you're alone
And I'm alone
I could touch us three months ago
But now it makes you so upset

why you say I don't know how to love?
I simply don't understand my life

You can say you don't know
But I remember football in the snow
Everybody's gone home

Why don't you love me anymore

why you say I don't know how to love?
I simply don't understand my life

But you say I don't know how to love
I simply don't understand my life

But you say I don't know how to love
I simply don't understand my life
