Pulled the tip back, here lies
Puncture wound in all
The hunting knife
Silhouetted wicked times

Bitten wool, bitten wool
Bitten wool, pull over me
Bitten wool, bitten wool
Bitten wool, pull over me

I'm never safe alone
In these long lost fictions
Never safe alone

Shattered silver sooth
I'm a wielding victim's sword
Frozen warning chant
Pray for me, the risk I'll take

Bitten wool, bitten wool
Bitten wool, pull over me
Bitten wool, bitten wool
Bitten wool, pull over me

I'm never safe alone
Never safe alone
Never safe alone
Never safe alone
