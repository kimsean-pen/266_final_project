Take me down, to the underground.
Won't you take me down, to the underground.
Why oh why; there is no light.
And if I can't sleep, can you hold my life?

And all I see is you.

And take my hand; I lost where I began.
In my heart I know all of my faults;
Will you help me understand?

And all I believe in you; you're the other half of me.
Soothe and heal.
When you sleep, when you dream, I'll be there if you need me,
Whenever I hear you sing.

There is a sun, it'll come, the sun, hear them call me down.

I held you once, a love that once, and life had just begun.
And you're all I see.
And trumpets blew, and angels flew on the other side.
And you're all I see, and you're all I'll need.
There's a love that God puts in your heart.
