Held at the hands of few, the keys to annihilation
Gained a seat at the top through deception and persuasion
Fragile bodies with feeble egos
Self convincing of a world overthrown
False prophets, propaganda
Projecting truth as fucking slander

Held at the hands of you, the keys to annihilation
Chomping at the bit for world war and domination
Fear has bested all in your narcissistic world
The blueprint to destruction is now unfurled

Your words all paid in full
Your finger on the worlds pulse
Flatline at the plug you pull
This war, your greatest creation

Time is nigh, let war begin
Time is nigh, war and bloodshed
True all out war
