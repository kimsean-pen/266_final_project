See her world lit so bright
See her bird take flight

See her face, wild and charged
See her quickened heart

So if we fall, imagine that
Imagination's fine

So here I hope, for what you are
See all that I'm looking for...

I look to you

Future, we've found
To stay here
On higher ground

Future, we've found
To stay here
On higher ground

I look to you

I want to change
The future as I look into your eyes

I want to change
The future as I look into your eyes

I want to change
The future as I look into your eyes

I want to change
The future as I look into your eyes
Future as I look into your...
Look into your...
Look into your eyes

I look to you

Future, we've found
To stay here
On higher ground

Future, we've found
To stay here
On higher ground

Future, we've found
To stay here
On higher ground

Future, we've found
To stay here
On higher ground

I look to you
I look to you

Future, we've found
To stay here
On higher ground

Future, we've found
To stay here
On higher ground

I look to you
