단순하게
친하다 하기엔
내 마음이 uh 널 더 원해
너도 그런 듯 하다가도 oh
확실하게 정리는 안 해줘
So what are we, what are we?
지금 이게 도대체 뭔지
Oh oh oh oh
No
I want to know your answer
Baby, tell me
I need to know your answer
Baby, just tell me
말해줘 너와 내가 지금
무슨 사이인지 baby
I want to know your answer
Baby, tell me
I need to know your answer
Baby, just tell me
Tell me quick, baby, please
I can't wait no more
말해줘 baby
I can't wait no more
I can't wait no
말해줘 baby
너와 걷던 그 밤에
그때 분명히 느꼈어 너한테
I see you tryna play it cool
But you're just acting
Like a fool, I know
So what are we, what are we?
지금 이게 도대체 뭔지
Oh oh oh oh
No
I want to know your answer
Baby, tell me
I need to know your answer
Baby, just tell me
말해줘 말해줘
너와 내가 지금 무슨 사이인지 baby
I want to know your answer
