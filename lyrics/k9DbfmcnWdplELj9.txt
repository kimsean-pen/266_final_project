Fight like a title holder
Stand like a champion
Live like a warrior
And never let 'em break you down

Fight like a title holder
Stand like a champion
Live like a warrior
And never let 'em break you down

We're up against the ropes but we never choke
When the pressure comes, we go for broke
We've been beat up, yeah we've been knocked down
Come back twice as hard and go round for round
Hit 'em pound for pound, we're gonna see it through
Not giving up, it's not what we do
Bell rings and they're counting down
But we won't be counted out

You know you gotta fight like a title holder
Stand like a champion
Live like a warrior
And never let 'em break you down

Fight like a title holder
Stand like a champion
Live like a warrior
And never let 'em break you down

I've been told I can't, been told I won't
Been told to compromise but I don't
I've been beat up, yeah I've been knocked down
Come back twice as hard and go round for round
Hit 'em pound for pound, I'm gonna see it through
Not giving up, I've been black and blue
And all my scars remind me my worst days are behind me

You know you gotta fight like a title holder
Stand like a champion
Live like a warrior
And never let 'em break you down

Fight like a title holder
Stand like a champion
Live like a warrior
And never let 'em break you down

Fight like a title holder
Stand like a champion
Live like a warrior
And never let 'em break you down

Fight like a title holder
Stand like a champion
Live like a warrior
And never let 'em break you down
Never let 'em break you down
Never let 'em break you down
