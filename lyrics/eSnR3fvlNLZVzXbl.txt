She's a nice girl and I like her style
But she's a hunchback
I'm not a pretty guy got a wooden eye
But she's a hunchback

I take her to the football game
She's my little Notre Dame
And I know things won't be the same
Without a hunchback

Took her to the dance looking for romance
She's a hunchback
And when she does the twist I just can't resist
Watching a hunchback

Everybody's laughing at me
Why can't they just let us be?
She'll go down in history
She's got a hunchback

I got a hunch then again, I just don't know
She drinks Hawaiian punch she calls me Quasimodo

I'm a lucky fella, she's my Esmeralda
Doin' what I oughta, she always brings me water

I know, I'm doing well, she's ringing my bell
She's got a hunchback
Yeah, I'm feeling fine 'coz she's so divine
With a hunchback

I take her down to gay Paris
On films and books we don't agree
She can't walk and I can't see
She's got a hunchback
