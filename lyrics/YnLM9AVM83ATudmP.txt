We have no hopes
We have no lies
I'll stop loving you when Dr. Manhattan dies
You're the alien of my life
Love will never tear us two apart

Green eyes
Black skin
Big hair
Let me in

You have a really awesome life
Eating pizzas everyday with a bunch of fries
Cheap beer and weed up in the night
You can't skate 'cause you're too high

Green eyes

Big hair
Let me in
