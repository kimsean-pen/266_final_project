I see through your disguise
You are tangled in the lines, caught between where hope collides
(Your staring eyes)
Your heart is paralyzed tonight
And the world will melt away, hanging on the words you say

With every word, with every word
You put your heart in my hands

With every word you say, you take a part of me
We're one day closer, the wait is over
With every word you say, you steal my heart away
We're one day closer, the wait is over

You see my demise
As I dangle in the lines that I've retraced a thousand times
(Between the lines)
My heart's been compromised tonight
As the edges tear away, hanging on the words you say

With every word, with every word
You put your heart in my hands

With every word you say, you take a part of me
We're one day closer, the wait is over
With every word you say, you steal my heart away
We're one day closer, the wait is over

Take a part of me, take a part of me
Take a part of me, take a part of me

With every word you say, you take a part of me
We're one day closer, the wait is over
With every word you say, you steal my heart away
We're one day closer, the wait is over

Now we're one day closer, yeah
Now the wait is over
Now we're one day closer
