I just wanna see
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see
I just wanna see the light

Even if it makes me blind
I just wanna see the light
Breathing, leave it all behind
I just wanna see the light

Even if it makes me blind
I just wanna see the light
Breathing, leave it all behind
I just wanna see the light

Light, light, light, light, light, light, light
I just wanna see the light

I just wanna see the light

Even if it makes me blind
I just wanna see the light
Breathing, leave it all behind
I just wanna see the light

Even if it makes me blind
I just wanna see the light
Breathing, leave it all behind
I just wanna see the light

Even if it makes me blind
I just wanna see the light
Breathing, leave it all behind
I just wanna see the light

I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see the light
Light, light, light, light, light, light, light
I just wanna see the light

I just wanna see the light

I just wanna see
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see the light

I just wanna see the light
Even if it makes me blind
Even if it makes me blind
