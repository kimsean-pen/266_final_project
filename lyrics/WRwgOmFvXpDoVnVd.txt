We'll win a war
Put me under a score
Do you feel me?
There's a look in your eyes
Something's up tonight
I can feel it

And the air is thick
With the scent of it
And the dam won't break
One tear falls, tension cracks the walls
And relief comes

Me and you
Baby we made it through (oh!)
Me and you
We've got some loving to do (oh!)
Kiss me once
And you will watch me fall (oh!)
Kiss me twice
And I will give you my all

We'll push through
Like too fools should do
Do you feel me?
Come up for air
It's dark in here
Do you love me? (Do you love me?)

And the night will come
Listen to my run
Stand and face the pain
One tear falls, tension cracks the walls
And relief comes

Me and you
Baby we made it through (oh!)
Me and you
We've got some loving to do (oh!)
Kiss me once
And you will watch me fall (oh!)
Kiss me twice
And I will give you my all

Me and you
Baby we made it through
Me and you
We've got some loving to do (oh!)
Kiss me once
And you will watch me fall (oh!)
Kiss me twice
And I will give you my all
