I dont like anything
but I love everyone somedays
sometimes when the going gets rough
I cry somedays
And on sunday I pray to God
dont know whom, but he gives me love
somedays, somedays
I feel grateful for this days
and everyday after, I cant get out of bed
wont acknowledge what is in my head
somedays somedays
and when the sun is out, and people about it
restoresy faith
somedays somedays.
