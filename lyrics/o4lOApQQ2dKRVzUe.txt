I can't laugh at the same jokes anymore
It feels too serious to begin with
I'm seriously considering a change of idealism
I'm so sick and tired of being cocky and poor
But when i see the assholes honking
I feel so ticklish with my confidence
All the wisdom
All the backlash
So many things
I can't take back
No way to know
If I would've known that
All the ease
All the setback
