Live in isolation, sociopath needs
Stay the fuck away,
I'll blow your goddamn brains,
And I don't need your existence
Solitude, psychopatic, gone insane
The fucking pleasure
Of self mental raped
Get away from me,
It's your fucking risk,
Addicted to misery, just let me be
I am my own god, try to mess with me
And you'll be buried
In your own fucking shit
So leave me alone
