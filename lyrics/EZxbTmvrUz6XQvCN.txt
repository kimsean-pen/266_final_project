Touch the shell
Only traces remain like a stain on the bed post
Where I lay chamber fades
Second stage, I am tied to the venom

I feel it compressing
They call it a blessing
I call it my grave

I latched to a heart so clinical
I was alive to fight
It feels unnecessary
Pressure is a mortuary
I lost static like a ritual
I was alive to fight
It feels unnecessary
Pressure is a mortuary

I feel it compressing
They call it a blessing
I call it my grave

I feel a darkness
Survive off my beating heart
I was alive when the sun went down
I was alive when the sun went down
I feel a darkness
Survive off my beating heart
I was alive when the sun went down
I was alive when the sun went down

And when you're touching a lie
Are you thinking of me?
I know I'm scratching a lie
And I'm finding a thief
I was alive when the sun went down
I was alive when the sun went down

I was alive
All the lies, all the shame
Cleanliness washed away
Chamber fades in this venom too late
For once I was alive
I was alive
I was alive
I was alive

I latched to a heart so clinical
I was alive to fight
It feels unnecessary
Pressure is a mortuary
I lost static like a ritual
I was alive to fight
It feels unnecessary
Pressure is a mortuary

I feel it compressing
They call it a blessing
I call it a grave
