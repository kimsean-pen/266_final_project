I page her on the phone
drank the posion
hold it in the light
running from the night
pray a horse would come
endure a hale storm
to carry me away
but I just wanna stay

The only thing
Im wandering
Is where I'll go
When I'm between the shores

I swim a hollow lake
cut from memories
underneath the earth
resting on a curve
holding out my hands
trying to understand
the tv plays a song
and we just carry on

the only thing
I'm wandering
is where ill go
when im between the shores
