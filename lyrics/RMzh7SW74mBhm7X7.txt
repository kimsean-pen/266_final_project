My past is littered with the bones of men who
Were fools enough to sleep on me
A missionary in a sea of mercenaries
Who knows what the past will bring?

My favorite transgressions
Lost track of the light
My favorite transgressions
Lost track of the light

From the edge of a life in the present tense
I need something that resembles a defense

My past is littered with the bones of men who
Were fools enough to sleep on me
No reprieve, no redemption
No reprieve, no redemption

No reprieve, no redemption
No reprieve, no redemption

Hideous words for hideous things
How dare you, how embarrassing
When I wanna get cut in the middle of the night
Well, I know how to clip the wings

Hideous words for hideous things
How dare you, how embarrassing
When I wanna get cut in the middle of the night
Well, I know how to clip the wings
