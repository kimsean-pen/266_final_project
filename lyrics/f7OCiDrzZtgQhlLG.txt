Face down; this is where it leads you - too far.
Buried covered now, you'll find peace - in the earth aground.
Stop now, there's no point in breathing - it's not allowed.
On the surface, how can you find - reason to move on?

Until then you can runaway.
Do your best to hide your face.
And oh I know you best;
I know you get what you get
you get what you deserve.

Hush now, don't say a word - it's out in the open,
And tell me how can you deal with all this wait?
Speak now, you must have a secret kept down,
Down where you can keep it - I need you to spill your guts.

Until then you can runaway,
Do your best to hide your face.
And oh I know you best.
I know you get what you get
Until then you can runaway.
Do your best to hide your face.
And oh I know you best.
I know you get what you get
you get what you deserve.

Speak now you must have a secret kept down,
Down where you can keep it - I need you to spill your guts.

Until then you can runaway,
Do your best to hide your face.
And oh I know you best.
I know you get what you get
Until then you can runaway.
Do your best to hide your face.
And oh I know you best,
I know you get what you get
and all you get what you,
You get what you get,
you get what you,
You get what you get,
and all you get what you deserve.
