We turn away to face the cold
Enduring chill
As the day begs the night
For mercy love

The sun so bright
It leaves no shadows
Only scars, carved into stone
On the face of it

The moon is up
And over one tree hill
We see the sun go down
In your eyes

You run like a river
On like a sea
You run like a river
Runs to the sea

And in the world, a heart of darkness
A fire zone
Where poets speak their heart
Then bleed for it

Jara sang, his song a weapon
In the hands of one
Though his blood still cries
From the ground

It runs like a river
Runs to the sea
It runs like a river
To the sea

I don't believe in painted roses
Or bleeding hearts
While bullets rape the night
Of the merciful

I'll see you again when the stars
Fall from the sky
And the moon has turned red
Over one tree hill

We run like a river
Runs to the sea
We run like a river
To the sea

And when it's raining
Raining hard
That's when the rain will
Break my heart

Raining, raining in the heart
Raining in your heart
Raining, raining to your heart
Raining, raining, raining
Raining to your heart
Raining, ooh, ooh
To your heart
To the sea
Oh, great ocean
Oh, great sea
Run to the ocean
Run to the sea
