I spent my weeks running wild
And now my days they have changed
I never thought I'd be
The girl that walked away
I found my one true love
In me you found it too

A path that ran to me and didn't make it hard to choose
'Cause you found me hiding
With my heart hanging on the wall
You took a chance on me and

Didn't think that I would fall

You gave me hope and you let me know that oh
If I give it time it will all be mine and oh
You gave me something that I didn't have before
So I'ma give you something
To stop you saying more
You gave me something
I didn't have before

And I'ma give you something
To stop you saying more

Amber's all I ever saw
Like my life was on hold
I never thought I'd see
The day the light turn green
I'm holding onto gold
It's me that you did trust
And nobody's stone is carved
Who knows if this will last
'Cause you found me hiding

With my heart hanging on the wall
You took a chance on me
And didn't think that I would fall

You gave me hope and you let me know that oh
If I give it time you'll all be mine and oh
You gave me something that I didn't have before
So I'ma give you something to stop you saying more
You gave me something
I didn't have before
And I'ma give you something
To stop you saying more

You gave me something
I didn't have before
And I'ma give you something
To stop you saying more

Running now, I'm running now
I'm running all the way
I'm running now, I'm running

When I'm running all the way
I'm running running running running
Running all the way
I'm running running running running
Running all the way

You gave me hope and you let me know that oh
If I give it time you'll all be mine and oh
You gave me something
I didn't have before
So I'ma give you something to stop you saying more
You gave me something I didn't have before
And I'ma give you something to stop you saying more
You gave me something I didn't have before
And I'ma give you something to stop you saying more
You gave me something I didn't have before
And I'ma give you something to stop you saying more
You gave me something I didn't have before
And I'ma give you something to stop you saying more
