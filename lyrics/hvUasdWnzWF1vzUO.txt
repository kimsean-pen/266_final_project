How can I sleep tonight?
Visions are dancing over my head
No rest for the heart
No rest for the body
How can I sleep tonight?
When I close my eyes
I see you

How can I sleep tonight?
Shadows are dancing over my head
No rest for the soul
No rest for the body
How can I sleep tonight?
When I close my eyes
I see you
When I close my eyes
I see you
