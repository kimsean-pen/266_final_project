Quick to claim that he not no snake like, "Me neither"
They need to take a breather
He been rhyming longer than Sigmund the sea creature
Been on Saturday feature -- pleased to meet cha'
And came to wake you up out the deep sleeper, like --
He needed to stop before he caught the knee-drop
Even give you more zip-zip then ZZ Top
On full beers, though shall not ball corners
Geedorah like, "One more step, and y'alls goners"
So-called rich, front if y'all wanna
When he spit electrics don't be in y'all saunas
He only here to warn us what the plan is
The hour is upon us, it's bananas
Born alone die alone, no matter who your man is
Hope he live long enough to tell it to his grandkids
King Geedorah, three-finger ring fever
Spring chicken eater, ID'ed as the ringleader
