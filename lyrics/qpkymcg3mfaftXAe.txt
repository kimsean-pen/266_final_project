Either you down or you ain't
You either riding or you can't
Down or you ain't

You told me I could trust you, don't lie
I could really use it
Everybody need love, even niggas like me
You told me I could trust you
And I could really use it

So much I wanna talk about
But I ain't got no one to talk to (Shit, I don't)
I'm always tryna work it out
But somehow it always falls through
And I know that I get rough
But I just wanna feel love
Sometimes
Either you down or you ain't
You either riding or you can't
Real Shit

You told me I could trust you, Stay ten toes for a nigga
Don't lie
(I ain't running game on you)
I could really use it
Stay ten toes for a nigga, shorty, stay ten toes for a nigga
You told me I could trust you
The more I tell you, the more you wanna know
And I could really use it
If I tell you, will you use it when I'm low?

Hood fame, everybody know my name when
I come through
But don't nobody scream it like you
I was having visions with you
Doing thangs, switching lanes in the beamer
With you
And swimming in deep water
Save me from my sorrows
Swimming in deep
Just some peace is all I need
So why can't I get that for free?

You told me I could trust you, Stay ten toes for a nigga
Don't lie
I ain't running game on you
I could really use it
Stay ten toes for a nigga, shorty, stay ten toes for a nigga
You told me I could trust you
The more I tell you, the more you wanna know
And I could really use it
If I tell you, will you use it when I'm low?
If I tell you, will you use it when I'm low?
