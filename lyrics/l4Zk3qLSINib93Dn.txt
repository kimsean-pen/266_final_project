1. Winner's Blues
[Thurston]
by the way, go out not today
move back along and wait a long long time
nothing running free, you gotta time it all
run out the door come back when you score
new times will come and you will see a door
into the lion eye and now I'm gone
and it's out
and it's not what you thought it was about
but a life, that you know
will keep you bound in

sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
sometimes you got still the blues for me
I could run away, a long time to stay
burn out your eyes, burn out surprise
look out today you know it's not the same
it's all the rage, it's every day
and it's out
and it's not what you thought it was about
but a life, that you know
will keep you round in love
