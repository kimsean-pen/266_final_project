God,
Grant me light
Light in my heart, light in my tomb,
Light in my speech, light in my seeing and light in my hearing
Light in my skin, light in my hair
Light in my flesh, light in my blood and light in my bones and light in my spirit,
Light before me, light behind me,
Light to the right of me, light to the left of me,
Light above me, light beneath me,
Increase my light
Forever into all directions
O God, strenghten my light and give me the greatest light of all,
The light of your darkness,
Grant me light, God of night.
