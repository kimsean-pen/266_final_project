Eye popping, gate crashing
Light flashing, fence hopping love
Mind-spinning, back breaking
Soul taking, heart stopping love

So take a minute
Take your heart to the limit
Baby own it and make it your fight

We're gonna be out of our heads, tonight
We're gonna be out of our heads
We're gonna be out of our heads, tonight
We're gonna be out of our heads
The past, the present and the future is gonna be fine
We're gonna be out of our heads, tonight
We're gonna be out of our heads

Oh all the law breakers, all the naughty love makers
This is your time
This is your time
Arm thrashing, chest thumping,
All calming, deep breathing love
Whoa-oh
Fist punching, head banging
Up sounding, jaw crunching love

So take a mouthful
Who wants to be subliminal
Oh if we make it to light

We're gonna be out of our heads, tonight
We're gonna be out of our heads
We're gonna be out of our heads, tonight
We're gonna be out of our heads
The past, the present and the future is gonna be fine
We're gonna be out of our heads, tonight
We're gonna be out of our heads
Oh all the law breakers, all the naughty love makers
This is your time

Oh so it lies on the seven
Turn it up to eleven
Baby, no, don't filter the light
Yeah, we all have a mission
Take the time to wet the levee
From the left, right, and falling behind

We're gonna be out of our heads, tonight
We're gonna be out of our heads
We're gonna be out of our heads, tonight
We're gonna be out of our heads
The past, the present and the future's gonna be alright
We're gonna be out of our heads, tonight
We're gonna be out of our heads
Oh all the law breakers, all the naughty love makers
This is your time
This is your time
Oh all the law breakers, all the naughty love makers
This is your time
