Find a thread to pull and we can watch it unravel
Because we've been living with a ghost of summer from two years ago

A hint of light in the dark
But only enough to keep from giving up
If I could go back to the start
To break the pattern forming between us

A needle dragging thread
To form the chapters only we could know
But they will overlap
And cast a shadow on what little is left

Find a thread to pull and we can watch it unravel
But this is just the start
We'll find out who we are

A hint of light in the dark
But only enough to keep from giving up
If I could go back to the start
To break the pattern forming between us
