So it's a charming disposition
You could call it nihilistic
And I thought that I would miss it
While still wishing that I didn't
But I wish that I could give it
Half as well as I can take it
Still I'm learning how to fake it
And I fake it but can't fake the fact that I

I would fly you to New York
Just to watch you walk across
Walk across a crowded room
But I don't believe in nothing
Least of all my own intentions
Still I wish the best for you
For you
For you
For you

Cool party
It's like the best party
Like I wish that I had something to wear
But every word that I said
Was out of my head
Out of my head
Out of my head
What I'd meant to say was
How can I give you what you ask me for
If I don't wanna take care of myself no more?
No more of that again

So even then, it's ironic
As I say I still got it
As I'm pale-faced and prodding
Still performing with my pain arranged in front
And I'm not fine
Anymore than I am on time
And I'm late again for something
That I can't ignore
Like I can't ignore that I

I would fly you to New York
Just to watch you walk across
Walk across a crowded room
And I don't believe in nothing
Just not most things
Just not lately
I suppose I wanted to

Do you?
Do you?
Do you?

Cool party
It's like the best party
Like I wish that I had something to wear
I can't get out of my head
Out of my head
Out of my head
Out of my head
And I can't give you what you ask me for
I don't wanna take care of myself
Anymore
No more
No more
No more
No more
No more
No more
No more

Don't worry
I'm not gonna do
What you think that I'm gonna do
Which is just flip out!!

Flip out!!

Party's over
