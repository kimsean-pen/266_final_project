Lighthouse in view
But this ship's still sinking
What were you thinking?
It's over

Dazed and confused
There's no use in crying
There's no shame in dying
A loner

It's gonna be a long cold winter
For saints and for sinners
You go down
Go down in flames to the river
No one's there to save you now
No one's there to save you
You go down in flames to the river
I can't believe it's shattered now
I can't believe it's shattered
You go down in flames

Dark into dawn
The lowland's gone quiet
No one was buying your story
Fell like a bomb
Nothing got wasted
Lost all the taste they had for it
