Underwater I wrote drowning
I use to be such good good swimmer
But for now my heads is in the clouds
I'm a silly love song
a twisted elbow crush song

I would go to jail with only boys
Just to prove I was as tough as you
And when I get out for good behavior
I'll be writing love songs
Silly banging knee songs

I'm a car crash
But I have to get up
And every morning it's a cleanup
All I need is time, time to love you

The forecast is grey
But we're staying inside
You must live close
I've seen you drive by

I left signs on the lawn
Where have they gone?
Did you take them to tease me
To follow or lead me?

You're a silly love song
A verse chorus and such
some silly love song
A verse chorus and such

I'm a car crash
But I have to get up
And every morning it's a cleanup
All I need is time, time to love you
All I need is time, all I need is time
All I need is time, time to love you
All I need is time, all I need is time
All I need is time, time to love you
All I need is time, time to love you
Time to love you
