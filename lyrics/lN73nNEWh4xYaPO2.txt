When I found the point of life
It came creeping towards me
In the shape of eyes

It was all this reimagined
It was a different kind of speech
It was repitition
It was what you want it to be

When I saw the shape of sound
Everything came spiralling

It was all this reimagined
It was a different kind of speech
It was repitition
It was what you want it to be

Breathe
Breathe in
Once you found the breath you lost
You'll breathe again

Breathe
Breathe in
Once you found the breath you lost
You'll breathe again

It was all this reimagined
It was a different kind of speech
It was repitition

And I am exactly what you imagine me to be
