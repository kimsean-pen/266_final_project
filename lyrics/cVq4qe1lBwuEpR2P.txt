This and that, they must be the same
What is legal is just what's real
What I'm given to understand
Is exactly what I steal

I wormed my way into the heart of the crowd
I wormed my way into the heart of the crowd
I was shocked to find what was allowed
I didn't lose myself in the crowd

Shot by both sides
On the run to the outside of everything
Shot by both sides
They must have come to a secret understanding

New offenses always in my nerves
They're taking my time by force
They all sound the same when they scream
As a matter of course

I wormed my way into the heart of the crowd
I wormed my way into the heart of the crowd
I was shocked to find what was allowed
I didn't lose myself in the crowd

Shot by both sides
On the run to the outside of everything
Shot by both sides
They must have come to a secret understanding

"Why are you so edgy, kid?"
Asks the man with the voice
One thing follows another
You live and learn, you have no choice

I wormed my way into the heart of the crowd
I wormed my way into the heart of the crowd
I was shocked to find what was allowed
I didn't lose myself in the crowd

Didn't lose myself in the crowd
Didn't lose myself in the crowd
I was shocked to find what was allowed
Didn't lose myself in the crowd

Well, I wormed my way
Well, I wormed my way
Well, I wormed my way
Well, I wormed my way

Well, I wormed my way
Well, I wormed my way
Well, I wormed my way
Well, I wormed my way

Shot by both sides
I don't ask who's doing the shooting
Shot by both sides
We must have come to a secret understanding
