My heart in your hands The past in your eyes.
Smiling in your harms, Crying with the time.

The sing of the birds, From this darkness
Remember me All my sadness

Dancing the song of the stones... down the rain in an ancient earth

The breath of the sea And the light of the moon
Take my soul To the infinite space
The song of the wind And the noise of this night
Go with me In this mystic dance
