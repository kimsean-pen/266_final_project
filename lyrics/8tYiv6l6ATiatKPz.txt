Monday morning
Dirty sidewalks
Waiting for me
Outside the door
Walking slowly
On those three blocks
Things won't be like
They were before
Ooh Oh
Endless ...
Under ...
And the springtime
Spent by the sea
All those people
All around me
Were they strangers
Or was it me
Figure out what
I Want to be
All of that time
Around in me
