Used to know a boy, he was so shy
Never knew his thoughts, he never knew mine
My troubles disappeared whenever he came close
Was walking on air, my feelings exposed

Ooh, ooh, my life would be a different game
Ooh, ooh, lucky never we became
Ooh, ooh, and now so many years have past
Ooh, ooh, my memory's as clear as glass

I used to be the girl who never had a plan
Was only daydreaming of only one man
Smoking in my room crying over you
Walking on air into the blue

Ooh, ooh, my life would be a different game
Ooh, ooh, so lucky never we became
Ooh, ooh, and now so many years have past
Ooh, ooh, my memory's as clear as glass
