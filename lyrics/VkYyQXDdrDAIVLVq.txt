I want to see you laying in my bed
I want to do you and then tell all my friends
That I am so fond of you
Baby, can you see me through?

It's what you do, don't leave me blue
All my tears gone dry, I'm high up in the sky
It's what you do, don't leave me blue
All my tears gone dry, I'm high up in the sky

And you're like honey, soft and sweet to me
I have to taste you, I feel the summer breeze
And I am so fond of you
I stick to you just like glue

It's what you do, don't leave me blue
All my tears gone dry, I'm high up in the sky
It's what you do, don't leave me blue
All my tears gone dry, I'm high up in the sky
