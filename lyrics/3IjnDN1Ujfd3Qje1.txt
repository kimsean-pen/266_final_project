Give it a whirl, give it a try
Why don't you sleep out, start living high?
You're on your own, you make your bed
No time for wasting, just look ahead

Your poppa don't mind what you do or say
You can't surprise him anymore
He's got a reputation that he don't look back
Your poppa don't mind at all

He's getting old, it's getting late
It's soon tomorrow, so celebrate
Bring it out and go to town
Before you're thinkin' of settling down

Your poppa don't mind what you do or say
You can't surprise him anymore
He don't believe in heaven like a good man should
Your poppa don't mind at all

Finding out is half the fun
And when you find out don't try to run
And if you know then you've begun
But if you don't know it's still to come

Your poppa don't mind what you do or say
You can't surprise him anymore
He talks about his women and his old school's tie
Your poppa don't mind at all

Your poppa don't mind what you do or say
You can't surprise him anymore
He don't believe in heaven like a good man should
Your poppa don't mind at all
Your poppa don't mind at all
Your poppa don't mind at all
