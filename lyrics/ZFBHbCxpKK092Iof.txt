I'm not lost I just haven't found everything I need
I'm not torn I'm just getting it together
I'm not broken don't ya mind the pieces of me
You see scattered on the ground
I swear, I'll turn this all around

I'm not home but I'm sitting here in my room
I'm photograph in need of a zoom
I feel far away I can't make out the face
It's all blurred since you went away

When you took your keys out you took a little piece of me

I'm a circle incomplete
I'm a heart that barely beats
All the memories stay forever like tattoos
I'm a star without a sky
I'm hello with no goodbye
I'm the the dreams we had that never will come true
That's me with no you

I'm a mark, I'm a martyr, I'm a victim, I'm a jerk
I'm an engine that just doesn't seem to start
I'm a kingdom with no king, I'm a king without a crown
So I fall down on my knees and I pray nobody sees

You got my attention, now please come back to me
(Come back to me)

I'm a circle incomplete
I'm a heart that barely beats
All the memories stay forever like tattoos
I'm a star without a sky
I'm hello with no goodbye
I'm the the dreams we had that never will come true
That's me with no you

Can't find the words to fit the melody
But I swear that I could sing it - when you were here with me
I'm all over the place, on a scale of 1 to 10
I'm a C (that's me)

I'm not lost I just haven't found everything I need
I'm not torn I'm just getting it together

I'm a circle incomplete
I'm a heart that barely beats
All the memories stay forever like tattoos
I'm a star without a sky
I'm hello with no goodbye
I'm the the dreams we had that never will come true
That's me with no you
That's me with no you
That's me with no you
Hooray
