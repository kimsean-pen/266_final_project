Jotunheim, Call the Giants
of Chaos, all the wolves of
Jarnveden, all the darkness of Utg책rd!
Call the Jotunheim!

Beware the Giants, the Thurizas,
beyond the border of everything.

In Utg책rd the ancient live
and they bear old memories
You can hear them cry beyond Eli waves.
Angerboda, call her name in the dark.
Hail!

Jotunheim, Call the Giants
of Chaos, all the wolves of
J채rnveden, all the darkness of Utg책rd!
Call the Jotunheim!

Listen to Mimer, come to his well,
you watch the water of memory.

If you listen to the Old,
they will take you to the past.
You may hear Manegarm hown again.
Angerboda, watch her call on the wolves.
Hail!

Thursar! Jotunheimr!
Resar! Jotunheimr!
Jotnar! Jotunheimr!
