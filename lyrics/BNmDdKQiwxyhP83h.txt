They're wide awake in dreams
Dawn colours beam
A stolen car screams past the early morning light
They're chattering their teeth
The sparrows sing
They've punched below their belts for another night
Wide awake they dream
Chasing an escape from themselves to another life

When they should've known exactly wrong from right
they're stepping over eggshells each line they'll
ever try
Lost like moths flying to lights
they're chasing an escape from theirselves with a sour line
euphoric dreams are lies

Bitten lips, big eyes
Euphoric dreams are lies, they are lies
Bit lips, big eyes
and trying to remold themselves
could've told themselves
They'd hit below their own belts each time they tried

Chasing vacant scenes
clinging to the clothes that they wear as an alibi
and wide awake asleep, in the living dream
Hiding in a space in their heads, they've never liked

When they should've known exactly wrong from right
they're stepping over eggshells each line they'll
ever try
Lost like moths flying to lights
they're chasing an escape from theirselves with a sour line
euphoric dreams are lies

They're wide awake in dreams, euphoric dreams
stepping over eggshells each line they'll ever try
they're wide awake in dreams, euphoric dreams
chasing an escape from themselves with a sour line
and trying to remold themselves, punched below their belts
they're stepping over eggshells each time they'll ever try
they once were butterflies
now they flew like moths to light
they're stepping over eggshells each time they'll ever try
they once were butterflies
now they flew like moths to lightthey're stepping over eggshells each time they'll ever try
wide awake in dreams
