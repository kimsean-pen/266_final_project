I always wanted to leave
I'm just so sick of how
You just invested in me
So now I gotta find the best way out
I always wanted to leave

Too many days that I've wasted
Say that I'm abrasive, complacent
Got you moving back and you can't face it
Some days I wish that both my lungs would cave
Fall asleep and never wake so that my words could breathe
Spare me all your insecurities
I've got my own but I don't flaunt them so religiously
Why do I keep giving time away
Guess I just have to say

I always wanted to leave
I'm just sick of how
You just invested in me
So now I gotta find my own way now
I always wanted to leave

I guess it's a shame
I'm so damn destructive and you're so reluctant to mean what you say
The way you act so abused
The things you confuse
You know I always wanted to leave

I always wanted to leave
I'm just so sick of how
You cut the deepest in me
Go find another wrist to leech from now
I always wanted to leave
