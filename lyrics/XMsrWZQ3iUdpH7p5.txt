The enemy is everywhere, the enemy is everywhere
The enemy is everywhere, the enemy is everywhere
But nobody seems to be worried or care
That the enemy is everywhere

The enemy is everywhere, the enemy is everywhere
The enemy is everywhere, the enemy is everywhere
But no one seems to be worried or care
That the enemy is everywhere

The enemy is everywhere, the enemy is everywhere
The enemy is everywhere, the enemy is everywhere
But no one seems to be worried or care
That the enemy is everywhere

The enemy is everywhere, the enemy is everywhere
The enemy is everywhere, the enemy is everywhere
But no one seems to be worried or care
That the enemy is everywhere
