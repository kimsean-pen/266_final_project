I play the streetlife, because there's no place I can go
Streetlife, it's the only life I know
Streetlife, and there's a thousand parts to play
Streetlife, until you play your life away

You let the people see, just who you wanna be
And every night you shine, just like a super star
That's how the life is played a ten cent masquerade
You dress, you walk, you talk
You're who you think you are

Streetlife, you can run away from time
Streetlife, for a nickel or a dime
Streetlife, but you better not get old
Streetlife, or you're gonna feel the cold

There's always love for sale a grown-up fairytale
Prince charming always smiles behind a silver spoon
And if you keep it young your song is always sung
Your love will pay your way beneath the silver moon

I play the streetlife, because there's no place I can go
Streetlife, it's the only life I know
Streetlife, and there's a thousand parts to play
Streetlife, until you play your life away - ooh
