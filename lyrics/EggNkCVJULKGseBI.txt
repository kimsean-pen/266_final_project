Sunshine, where'd you go?
I know tomorrow
You'll be waiting for me
I'll see morning
Until, until that sight
Firelight, goodnight

Starlight, I really want you
I'd do anything, I'd walk through your fire
If only, if only you'd peak through
Half of my battle is caught in your shadow

Sunshine, where'd you go?
I know tomorrow
You'll be waiting for me
I'll see morning

So come out
Climb out of your hide out
Reach out to me
I'll open my eyes

Sunshine, where'd you go?
I know tomorrow
You'll be waiting for me
I'll see morning

When you gonna come back?
You're gonna come back
You're gonna come back
You're gonna come back
You're gonna come back
You're gonna, you're gonna, you're gonna

Until, until that sight
Firelight, goodnight
