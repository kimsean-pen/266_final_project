Wide eyed, knee deep in surprise
Just below your thighs the temperature drops five degrees
Your standby flight has just arrived

Tongue-tied, bleeding from your eyes
Even Christ himself would cringe at the sight of your scars
While you're counting sheep, I'll count my lucky stars
You were the last good thing I ever saw

And I lost it all
I lost it all

Burned out on two hours of shut eye
Eyes glazed at the thought of the next eight hours
Headwind, cold rain to wake me

You were the last good thing I ever saw
