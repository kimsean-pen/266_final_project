Overnight I walk these midnight streets alone
All the lights they try to pull me in
Oh and I should be sleeping
Oh but I cant close my eyes anymore
So wide awake again

And everybody says that I should just forget
The hardest part is over with
But it's so dark and I cant see the light
There will never be a heart that I could break
That I could find to take your place
There's nothing I can do

I can't get over you overnight
Yeah I can't get over you overnight

Overnight I watch the strangers pass me by
Every time their face looks just like you
Oh and I still remember you in my arms
When I would hold you
Back when the sun would always rise too soon

And everybody says that I should just forget
The hardest part is over with
But it's so dark and I can't see the light
And there will never be a heart that I could break
That I could find to take your place
There's nothing I can do
I can't get over you overnight ohhh
I can't get over you overnight
Yes, I should be sleeping overnight
Yeah, I can't get over you overnight

I should be sleeping
I should be sleeping
I should be sleeping
I should be sleeping
I should be sleeping
I should be sleeping
I should be sleeping
I should be sleeping
I should be sleeping
I should be sleeping
I should be sleeping
I should be sleeping
I should be sleeping
I should be sleeping
I should be sleeping
I should be sleeping

Said everybody says that I should just forget
The hardest part is over with
It's so dark and I can't see the light
And there will never be a heart that I could break
That I could find to take your place
There's nothing I can do
I can't get over you overnight
I can't get over you overnight
