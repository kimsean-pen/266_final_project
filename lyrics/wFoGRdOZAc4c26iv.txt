Driving in a fast lane
Counting boundary marker signs

The empty seat beside me
Keeps you on my mind

Living in a heartache
There is something I pursue

I can keep on chasing
What I can be for you

Oooo skies are black and blue
Thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm

Tears on a highway
Water in my eyes
This rain ain't gonna change us
So I used to cry

I can say I'm sorry
But I don't wanna lie
I just wanna know if staying
Is better than goodbye

Oooo skies are black and blue
Thinking about you
Here in the calm after the story

Oooo after all that we've been through
There ain't nothin' new
Here in the calm after the storm

Baby I can find you
Down this broken line
Maybe you can find me
I guess we'll know in time

Oooo skies are black and blue
Thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm

There ain't nothing new
Here in the calm after the storm
