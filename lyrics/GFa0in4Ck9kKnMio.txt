I made a way
I made a way
Menoh
I made a way (Ayy)

I made a way
Now no rainy days (No rainy days)
Now I made a way
Now no rainy days (Ayy, no rainy days)
It's gon' be a long ride if you coming with me
I just threw two fingers up and did it for my city
I would never tell a lie
Know these niggas play it 50
Park the coupe they hop inside
They know we 'bout to get it litty
Know we gotta get it one way, some way
I'm a superstar, get the fuck out my face
Who are you tryna put me back in my place?
I didn't come to conversate
I came to get my cake (Ayy)

Keep my brothers by my side, they the only ones I trust
How you say you loyal when you left me in the dust?
I find it kinda funny
How they sayin' I switched up
Keep a bag inside my bag, remember bein' broke as fuck
And we made it through them dark nights, it's no joke
I would give up everything before I let this go
You say you understand
But I don't think you really know
I ain't worried about opinions
Only did this for my folks
And that's why

I made a way
Now no rainy days (No rainy days)
Now I made a way
Now no rainy days (Ayy, no rainy days)
It's gon' be a long ride if you coming with me
I just threw two fingers up and did it for my city
I would never tell a lie
Know these niggas play it 50
Park the coupe they hop inside
They know we 'bout to get it litty
Know we gotta get it one way, some way
I'm a superstar, get the fuck out my face
Who are you tryna put me back in my place?
I didn't come to conversate
I came to get my cake (Ayy)

I got people fuckin' with me
Just because a nigga lit
I know I had to do it like I'm Drizzy from the six
She wanna hop inside and have sex behind the tint
My doors are suicide, she didn't know how to get in
Everyday I be working, learning
I live a dark life, it can be a burden
I don't got no time for these birds chirping
Talking but be silent when we out in person
And that's why

I made a way
Now no rainy days (No rainy days)
Now I made a way
Now no rainy days (Ayy, no rainy days)
It's gon' be a long ride if you coming with me
I just threw two fingers up and did it for my city
I would never tell a lie
Know these niggas play it 50
Park the coupe they hop inside
They know we 'bout to get it litty
Know we gotta get it one way, some way
I'm a superstar, get the fuck out my face
Who are you tryna put me back in my place?
I didn't come to conversate
I came to get my cake
