Cry in the night of angels
For that light that never shine
With their hearts so full of sorrow
Muddy waters all around
The curtain falls for helpless souls
How they suffer swept aside
And the raging streams are flowing
with so little hope inside

(It's like)
Angels crying
Can't take no more
Angels dying
Capture their fall

Try to see this misery
your future is not what you wished it to be
So try to fly, the answer lies
in the angry darkened skies
(angry darkened skies)

You just keep on standing in these fields all your life
You sow the seeds that never grow
No harvest comes such a strain to feed the few
Still you're waiting, it's in vain...
The change must come right now!

Oh, see the sun in the sky
(From the dawn of destruction)
Free, free this chain from my heart...
(chain, chain, chain)
Hear the cry of angels
from this life you cannot hide
The change must come tomorrow
for the solemn weeping eyes

(Like)
Angels crying
Can't take no more
Angels dying
Captured in the fall

Try to see this misery
your future is not what you wished it to be
So try to fly, the answer lies
in the angry darkened skies
(angry darkened skies)

You just keep on standing in these fields all your life
You sow the seeds that never grow
No harvest comes such a strain to feed the few
Still you're waiting, it's in vain...
The change must come right now!

Angels are crying and dying
There must be some way
endless you stray, still you pray for a better life
Nobody sees when a glimpse
of your target lies behind you,
Like steps of the pilgrims unshined!
