Have no fear
For when I'm alone
I'll be better off than I was before

I've got this life
I'll be around to grow
Who I was before
I cannot recall

Long nights allow me to feel...
I'm falling... I am falling
The lights go out
Let me feel
I'm falling
I am falling safely to the ground
Ah...

I'll take this soul that's inside me now
Like a brand new friend
I'll forever know

I've got this light
And the will to show
I will always be better than before

Long nights allow me to feel...
I'm falling... I am falling
The lights go out
Let me feel
I'm falling
I am falling safely to the ground
Ah...
