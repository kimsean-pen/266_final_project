Our memory is all
We have left to feel alive
In the gloom we see
The night feeds lies to our eyes

We are the last ones awake
We are the last ones awake

In our hands
It's in our hands
We beat the band
We can stop, we can stop searching
In the air
It's in the air, everywhere
We can stop, we can stop searching

Elevate, escape from the lot we have to share
In the doom combined
There's salvation everywhere

We are the last ones awake
We are the last ones awake

In our hands
It's in our hands
We beat the band
We can stop, we can stop searching
In the air
It's in the air, everywhere
We can stop, we can stop searching

Drowned in fears, smote by life
We gave birth, but can't survive
Countless years trapped in scorn
We've deserved to be reborn

In our hands
It's in our hands
We beat the band
We can stop, we can stop searching
In the air
It's in the air, everywhere
We can stop, we can stop searching

In our hands
It's in our hands
We beat the band
We can stop, we can stop searching
In the air
It's in the air, everywhere
We can stop, we can stop searching
