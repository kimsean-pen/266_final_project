We ride the same bus
He knows my name
Covers a wet cloth
He sweats to stain

I want to know what kind of games he likes
I want to know what kind of games you like
He talks like he knows me so I'm being polite

Know not to cater
Untidy spreads
We rode the same bus
Until it wrecked

I want to know what kind of porn you like
I want to know what kind of porn you like
He asks me these questions, did he know the way?
No way

Hey, I think you win some and you lose some
Gone security
Hey, I think you blink some and you shame some
I'm hailing an ambulance
Hey, small thing, you catch some and infect some
But I don't wanna be the sullen type
I don't want a secret, secret life
I am going to be here till I never get to sleep

I want to know if the normies are right
I want to know if the normies are right
He looks past my answer
Did he earn the right?
No way
No way

Hey, I think you win some and you lose some
Gone security
Hey, I think you blink some and you shame some
I'm hailing an ambulance
Hey, small thing, you catch some and infect some
But I don't wanna be the present type
I don't want a secret, secret life
I have no idea what I really wanna be
