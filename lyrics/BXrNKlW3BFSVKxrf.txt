I'm sitting here alone
I'm working on your clone
Your clone will do all work
And all that boring things

And clones, they don't have souls
I do not really care
My actions seem all fair
Couldn't ask for more

Watch my body die
Sometimes it makes me cry
I know you want me to
I sometimes think of you

And in our perfect world
There would be no pets
No kids or other things
That compromise our time

And we could go to bars
They wouldn't make complaints
There wouldn't be no fights
Or at least just one

Watch my body die
Sometimes it makes me cry
I know you want me to
I sometimes think of you

Watch our bodies die
Sometimes it makes me cry
I know you want me to
I sometimes think of you
