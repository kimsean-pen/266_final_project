Feel a little hand turning inside me
Don't you think she feels us fighting?
Strike me at the root
I won't let you
Put her through
What you put me through

When I said I wanted it all
Doesn't every woman want it all?

Running through the house screaming
Girl unstrung, you could always play that one
Baptized of fire
And every beat in the bar
Hymns for her
Feel her kick me from the inside

When I said I wanted it all
Doesn't every woman want it all?
As a man, do you find
Doesn't every boy smoke to cry?

You could almost drown
Her waterfall
Yes
You could almost drown
My waterfall
Oh, yes

Through the looking-glass
Ruby sees things in you, things in me
She won't want to be just a little light
Turning the key
At the root, what I missed
She will carry

When I said I wanted it all
Doesn't every woman want it all?
As a man, do you find
Doesn't every boy smoke to cry?
Smoke to cry?
Smoke to cry?

Feel a little hand
Turning
Turning
Ruby
