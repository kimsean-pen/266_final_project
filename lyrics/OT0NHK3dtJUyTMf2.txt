there's an empty bottle on the table

here we are now standing in the door way

I'm not gonna see you for a long time
I understand, you don't need to explain
you're not gonna ask me to come with you
and I'm not gonna ask you to stay
let me hold you

wherever you may go I'm by your side
although we say goodbye, in the end I know we'll always be friends

we'll laught just like in the old days
it'll feel like nothing ever changed
it'll feel like nothing ever changed

let me hold you

wherever you may go I'm by your side
although we say goodbye, let me hold you
