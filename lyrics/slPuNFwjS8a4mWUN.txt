I woke up this morning wanting to cry
and when I called her I realised why.
Although she was honest, she spoke with a cold tongue.
I broke down in the courtyard when it came to light
she broke every promise in the space of one night.
She made me hate this city, immediatly.
I thought she was something else,
but as it turns out she was just someone else.

There where four questions I wanted to ask,
do you love him yet? Do you think it will last?
Where you wearing the pants I bought you?
do you ever think that he thought you resembled me in some way?
a boy left to break.

We spent two years together,
I thought I made her better.
All my best friends told me I should forget her,
but I never could, I thought that I should.
I need to stop thinking about the things I'll never do again,
and just be glad I did them, and I'm so glad I did them.

First love does not mean best love,
and best friends may not mean best friends forever,
but they both mean at somepoint, somewhere, someone did care
and their memories still there.

I know she was special,
I know she was good,
I know she wasn't flawless but I know I was loved.
I know she had passion,
I know she was kind,
so why should an ending alter my state of mind.
Although I find it hard to relive her,
I know that I would always forgive her.
She says no regrets, and I say don't forget.
