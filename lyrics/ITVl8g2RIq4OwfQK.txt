Seven o'clock and he ain't home,
So many thoughts runnin' through you,
Then you found out he makes his rounds when you go out,
Oh no...

When love is a lie,
We lock up inside with the walls up,
I'm takin' my time,
To show you I'm not gonna hurt ya,
That look in your eyes,
Is tellin' me more than your words could,
One of a kind, fixed in gold.

Honey, I don't know,
How he, let you go,
He's crazy,
Diamond girl,
He let me steal you like a thief in the night.
My diamond girl...

Every time you settled down,
You found a guy who put you out,
You were a gem lost in the rough,
So glad I found you now.

When love is a lie,
We lock up inside with the walls up,
I'm takin' my time,
To show you I'm not gonna hurt ya,
That look in your eyes,
Is tellin' me more than your words could,
One of a kind, fixed in gold.

Honey, I don't know,
How he, let you go,
He's crazy,
Diamond girl,
He let me steal you like a thief in the night.
So lucky that we met while walkin' under ladders,
It hit me in the blink of an eye,
That you're my diamond girl,
So let me steal you for the rest of my life.

Will somebody lock me up,
Cause baby I stole your love,
Romancing the stone we're on the run.

Honey, I don't know,
How he let you go,
He's crazy,
Diamond girl,
He let me steal you like a thief in the night.
So lucky that we met while walkin' under ladders,
It hit me in the blink of an eye,
That you're my diamond girl,
So let me steal you for the rest of my life.
My diamond girl...
