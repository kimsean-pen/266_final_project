Looking back upon my life and the places that I've been
Pictures, faces, girls that I've loved, I try to remember when
Faded memories on the wall, some names I have forgotten
But each one is a memory, I look back on so often

I look into the past
I want to make it last
I was there
I was there

I look into the past
I want to make it last
I was there
I was there

Looking back what I have done, there's lots more life to live
At times, I feel overwhelmed, I question what I can give
But I don't let it get me down or cause me too much sorrow
There's no doubt about who I am, I always have tomorrow

I look into the past
I want to make it last
I was there
I was there

I look into the past
I want to make it last
I was there
I was there

Looking back upon my life (on my life)
Faded memories upon the wall (on the wall)
Looking now at who I am (who am I?)
I don't let it get me down (I don't let it, get me down)

Looking back upon my life and the places that I've been
Pictures, faces, girls that I've loved, I try to remember when
But I don't let it get me down or cause me too much sorrow
There's no doubt about who I am, I always have tomorrow

I look into the past
I want to make it last
I was there
I was there

I look into the past
I want to make it last
I was there
I was there
