Let me see you bounce
let me see you bounce

If you really know what's good for you
ease the load, let it blow
come on baby tell me what you're waiting for
bring it on, here we go

Break free of all your senses baby close your eyes
just breathe to the rhythm of my body and mind

Let me see you bounce
we're goin' higher, feel the fire
let me see you bounce
it's on tonight, we're on the rise (oh)
let me see you bounce
you don't have to hide it, if you like it

Let me see you bounce
(let me see you bounce)
let me see you bounce

You gotta (gotta gotta gotta) let it go if you wanna
really wanna lose it (lose it)
come on (come on come on come on) put your hands up
do it all the way, move it (move it)

If you really don't wanna hold it back
let's react, spin the track
feel the beat take over and
let's pretend it'll never end

Break free of all your senses baby close your eyes
just breathe to the rhythm of my body and mind

Let me see you bounce (oh)
we goin' higher, feel the fire
let me see you bounce (oh)
it's on tonight, we're on the rise (oh)
let me see you bounce (oh)
you don' have to hide it, if you like it

Let me see you bounce
(let me see you bounce)
let me see you bounce

Girl I like it how you shake it on th floor
Everybody in the club wantin' some more
Girl I like it when you dip it on the floor
Everybody in the club beggin' for more
