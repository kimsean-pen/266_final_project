Open your eyes to the skies up above
Now is the time to express my love
Want you to hear my confession
You're my obsession
Do what you will do, but I can't help the way I feel for you

Your love's got me goin' around and around
And it's takin' me over
Your love's got me tumblin' upside down
And I want you to know it
Your love's got me goin' around and around
And it's takin' me over
It's you you you, it's only you

Open your eyes to the skies and the sun
I wonder if this day will be the one
Want you to hear my confession
You're my obsession
Do what you will do, but I can't help the way I'm wantin' you

Your love's got me goin' around and around
And it's takin' me over
Your love's got me tumblin' upside down
And I want you to know it
Your love's got me goin' around and around
And it's takin' me over
It's you you you, it's only you

It's taken everything I have
To get to here
You could crush my heart
At any moment
But I thought it best you know that

Your love's got me goin' around and 'round
And it's takin' me over
Your love's got me tumblin' upside down
And I want you to know it
Your love's got me goin' around and around
And it's takin' me over
It's you you you, it's only you

Aah aah
Your love's got me goin' around and around
And it's takin' me over
(Takin' me over)
Your love's got me tumblin' upside down
(Tumblin' upside down)
And I want you to know it
(You're so mean, you you you, it's only you)
Your love's got me goin' around and around
And it's takin' me over
It's you you you, it's only you
