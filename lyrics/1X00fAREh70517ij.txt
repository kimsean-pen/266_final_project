Fifty years ago with the world at war
Hands bloodied, devastated
Better believe they're back for more
Pounding the world with a fits of steel
Jack booted, heavy handed
Careless of the pain we feel

Bastards, throwing life away
Killers, alive today

Oh, oh oh oh
Don't tell no lies
I see through your eyes
You're bad to the bone

Oh, oh oh oh
Don't tell no lies
You can't hear the cries
'Cause you're bad to the bone

Times have changed, but he don't know
Zoot suit, black tie
Careless that the lies are low
One for all and all for one
I'm talking smooth, hidden truth
Time bomb ticking just begun

Bastards, throwing life away
Killers, alive today

Oh, oh oh oh
Don't tell no lies
Well, I see through your eyes
You're bad to the bone

Oh, oh oh oh
Don't tell no lies
You can't hear the cries
'Cause you're bad to the bone

Standing alone for the world to see
Well, non-starter, push harder
Be all that you can be
He still believes his time will come
Small wonder, old thunder
Can't he see that he's wrong

Bastards, throwing life away
Killers, alive today

Oh, oh oh oh
Don't tell no lies
I see through your eyes
You're bad to the bone

Oh, oh oh oh
Don't tell no lies
You can't hear the cries
'Cause you're bad to the bone

Oh, oh oh oh
Don't tell no lies
I see through your eyes
'Cause you're bad to the bone

Oh, oh oh oh
Don't tell no lies
You can't hear the cries
'Cause you're bad to the bone
