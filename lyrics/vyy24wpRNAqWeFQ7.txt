Revisit a life we both left behind, we don't know the harm
Move to the ever moving, all blazing, we go over and over, and over and over again
If I wait too long, I lose you from my sight, maybe tonight
I could stop dreaming and start believing in forever and ever, and ever and ever again

Reunion, reunion
Reunion, reunion
Never not ever, never not ever again

When there's burning inside, do you give it up?, how long should I wait?
There's no need to hide, when there's only you in here
There's an end to us with someone else in sight, you shine your light
And there goes that feeling, won't let me see them
Never not ever, never not ever again

Did I
See you
See me
In a new light?

Did I
See you
See me
In a new light?

Did I
See you
See me
In a new light?

Did I (Never again)
See you (Never again)
See me (Never not ever)
In a new light? (Never not ever again)

Did I
See you
See me
Never not ever, never not ever again
