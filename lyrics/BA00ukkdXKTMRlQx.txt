It's like drivin' with the headlights out,
Gone too fast and we can't slow down,
Drinkin' cause we know it's wrong, drink until it's right, yeah,
It's like drivin' with the headlights out.

So cordial, so stable,
So sure but so confused,
Too selfish, too lonely,
Too hard to face the truth,
I gotta say...

Before the damage is done,
Before you take what you want,
Before I take too long,
This isn't what I really want,
Before the damage is done,
Before you're callin' it love,
Before I break your heart,
This isn't what I really want.

Want, want, want,
This isn't what I really want.

It's like swimming with a ten ton weight,
Start to struggle but you know your fate,
There's no need to kill the lights, it's obvious you're blind,
Well, I guess I found another way to lie.

So cordial, so stable,
So sure but so confused,
Too selfish, too lonely
Too hard to face the truth,
I gotta say...

Before the damage is done,
Before you take what you want,
Before I take too long,
This isn't what I really want,
Before the damage is done,
Before you're callin' it love,
Before I break your heart,
This isn't what I really want.

So cordial, so stable,
So sure but so confused,
Too selfish, too lonely,
But I, but I can't commit to you...

Before the damage is done,
Before you take what you want,
Before I take too long,
This isn't what I really want,
Before the damage is done,
Before you're callin' it love,
Before I break your heart,
This isn't what I really want.
