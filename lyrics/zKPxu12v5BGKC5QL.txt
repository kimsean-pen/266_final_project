I don't have to be specific when I wanna hug you
You had a natural right to be born to become
Yes having my small niece becomes acceptable to me
I'd feel angry had I lost you
And can't imagine where you might be

Where do baby leaves go when they die
Oh, why I do not mourn
God is a feeling of loving yourself
You're precious to me, you know that

Stretch in your arms
Wrap 'em 'round tight
Loving myself
With all my might

Where do baby leaves go when they die
Oh, why I do not mourn
God is a feeling of loving yourself
You're precious to me, you know that

Take a look inside you'll see
See how I'm doing
A message, something says to me
Tells me I'm right
So you want a potion to send me away
Daddy, my love, cannot get in today
