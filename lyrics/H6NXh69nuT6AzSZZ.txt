I wanna destroy you
I wanna destroy you
I wanna destroy you
I wanna destroy you

I feel it coming on again
Just like it did before
They feed your pride with boredom
And they lead you on to war

The way you treat each other
Really makes me feel ill
'Cause if you want to fight
Then you're just dying to get killed

I wanna destroy you
I wanna destroy you

A pox upon the media
And everything you read
They tell you your opinions
And they're very good indeed

I wanna destroy you

And when I have destroyed you
I'll come picking at your bone
And you won't have a single atom left
To call your own

I wanna destroy you
I wanna destroy you

Wanna destroy you
Wanna destroy you
Wanna destroy you
