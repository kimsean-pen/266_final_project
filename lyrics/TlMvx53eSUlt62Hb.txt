Tonight
Looking back on all this life
It's funny how the time goes by
And how, sometimes
It slides away

Time
Sliding through the dead of night
Shaking 'till you start to cry
Your eyes won't dry
Till light of day

And sleep away
Don't let it go
Don't let fade
Your dreams may cave
And falling apart
Is the only way
We go so low
When you don't know
I will, I will

And if you go
Take a little piece of me
Hang it by the place you sleep
And dream of me
Don't leave

Just sleep away
Don't let it go
Don't let fade
Your dreams may cave
And falling apart
Is the only way
We go so low
When you don't know
I will

We go so low
When you don't know
I will, I will
Tonight
Looking back on all this life
It's funny how the time goes by
And how, sometimes
It slides away
