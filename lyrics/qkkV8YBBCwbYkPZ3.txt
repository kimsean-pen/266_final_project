Oh, walk on the water
For me
Just for me baby, o.k
Oh, there's always gon' be pressure, o.k

Pressure

Nothing's ever worse than work unnoticed
Freelance now, yeah I guess you earned it
Life is only wishing we could load it
Level up, you've got to make a bonus

Mystic staring at his phone for oneness
Silver or black mirror, what's the difference?
Imitation always gets a bad rep man
Witches Brew had me on on the first sip, man

Smells like autumn, smells like leaves
You don't know that you're rust and not belong so much
And then you get left alone
Left alone

Cloud hidden and my whereabouts unknown
Cazadero got me wearing all camo
Decked in Patagonia head to toe
Down for whatever, I think I let go

No more shoes and socks, I only rock sandals
I can't tell if I'm hip or getting old
I can't hear you, maybe you could change your tone
People tend to listen when they see your soul

Oh, walk on the water
For me
Just for me baby, o.k

Sometimes I think we are from the same place
Now I don't
What just happened, happened, happened, happened, happened, happened?
