You're pulling my heart
Keeping me up in the dark
I'm still on the chase
Still haven't seen your face
And it tears me apart
You know I keep a collection
Of my misplaced affections
The thought of you keeps grabbing my attention yeah
And have I even come close?
I just wanna see it for myself
I never wanna do this alone
Have you ever been in love?
I don't think I have, I don't think I have
So much wasted time
Or was it time well spent?
On past loves yeah we had it wrong
I had to lose them all to find out what it meant.
Waiting for something real
Everything else is just a shadow
I've been up and down this road
To find true love is nothing that I know
I just wanna see it for myself
I never wanna do this alone
Have you ever been in love?
I don't think I have, I don't think I have
I just wanna see it for myself
I never wanna do this alone
Have you ever been in love?
I don't think I have, I don't think I have
