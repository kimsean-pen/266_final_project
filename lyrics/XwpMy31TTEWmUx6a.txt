Where you are
Is it cold where you are?
I don't care if it's far, I just wish that I was
Where you are

When you woke me from a bad dream
I was drowning, I was fighting to breathe
And you said "love are you okay"?
Let the flood take everyone around me

And I'm sure that I will miss this
Later one day when I reminisce
When it all falls to pieces, the grey cold and speechless
I'll consider it a product of time

I don't mind it
Just let it take me whole
And pull me away

Where you are
Is it cold where you are?
I don't care if it's far, I just wish that I was
Where you are
(Wish I was where you are)

Feel the displacement
Feel the displacement take me home
Feel the displacement
Feel the displacement take me home
Feel the displacement
Feel the displacement take me home
Feel the displacement
Feel the displacement take me home
Feel the displacement
Feel the displacement take me home
Feel the displacement
Feel the displacement take me â€“

Where you are
Is it cold where you are?
I don't care if it's far, I just wish that I was
Where you are

Where you are
Is it cold where you are?
I don't care if it's far, I just wish that I was
Where you are
(Wish I was where you are)
