I never thought a first time love would ever last
How could a kiss like that knock me flat on my ass

He he

The burning bed
The roses dead
And now I'm dancing with myself

Yeah I'm missing you
Just like you want me to
You made me trip into the grind
Now I can't get off of my mind

Yeah your sweet talking hip shaking wobble gonna blow a man away
Kiss butt and guess what
Even double crossing' dogs have their day ha
So forget about regret about you're right I ain't afraid to say

Yeah I'm missing you
Just like you want me to
You made me trip into the grind
Now I can't get off

And the more I try
Leads to the same old why
You made me slip into the grind
Now I can't fetch off of the cloud we was on
And now it's all gone
Tell me why why why why
Why ain't I getting through
Ain't no lie there out of love love love
Tell me was it good for you
Tell me what you want
Yeah cause I'm missing you
Just like you knew I'd do
You made me trip into the grind
Now I can't get off
And I know I tried
Leads to the same old why
You made me trip into the grind
Now I can't can't can't get you

Get youOff of my mind
