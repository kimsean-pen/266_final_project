With all of who I am
At the pouring faith of a mindless mess
I was buried in myself
Take all your tantrum into the ground
Get out in the world my son
Your body wasn't made for this
You're gonna kill yourself
Kill yourself in the ambulance

But you forgot about me
I thought the drugs would set me free
God I've been blinded in the dark
I thought you promised me a weight that I could carry

My back is breaking
I'm falling apart

Give it up you're wasting time
Give it up you're wasting your life
There is a greater purpose
Your words were never worthless

Give it up you're wasting time
Give it up you're wasting your life
Nothing you brought is gone
You'll never come undone

We have one chance to be alive

There's a noose around my neck
A dead body tied to my ankles
There's a sound crashing my back
And my wrists are bound in shackles
I have the underside
There's room for another life
And let the sake of sacrifice
I'm not afraid to die

Now you could finally see
I said the truth would set you free
You have been blinded in the dark
But now I'm promising a life that's worth surrounding

My back is breaking
I'm falling apart

Give it up you're wasting time
Give it up you're wasting your life
There is a greater purpose
Your words were never worthless

Give it up you're wasting time
Give it up you're wasting your life
Nothing you brought is gone
You'll never come undone

Will you ever understand me?
How desperate do I have to be?

Give it up you're wasting time
Give it up you're wasting your life
There is a greater purpose
Your words were never worthless

Give it up you're wasting time
Give it up you're wasting your life
Nothing you brought is gone
You'll never come undone

Give it up you're wasting time
Give it up you're wasting your life
Nothing you brought is gone
You'll never come undone
