Gee, but it's great to be back home
Home is where I wanna be
I've been on the road so long, my friend
And if you came along, I know you couldn't disagree
It's the same old story, yeah

Everywhere I go I get slandered, libeled
I hear words I never heard in the Bible
And I'm one step ahead of the shoe shine
Two steps away from the county line
I'm just trying to keep my customer satisfied, satisfied

Deputy sheriff said to me
"Tell me what you come here for, boy
You better get your bags and flee
You're in trouble, boy, and now you're heading into more"
It's the same old story

Everywhere I go I get slandered, libeled
I hear words I never heard in the Bible
And I'm one step ahead of the shoe shine
Two steps away from the county line
Just trying to keep my customer satisfied, satisfied

But it's the same old story
Everywhere I go I get slandered, libeled
I hear words I've never heard in the Bible
And I'm so tired
I'm oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, so tired
(But I'm) Just trying to keep my customer satisfied, satisfied
Alright
