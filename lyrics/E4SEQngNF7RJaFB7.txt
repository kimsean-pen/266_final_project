Ah
Hey ah...
Oh whoa
Hey yeah
(Somehow)

Midnight shadows
When finding love is a battle
But daylight is so close
So don't you worry 'bout a thing

We're gonna be alright
Hey!
We're gonna be alright
Hey yeah
Oh yeah
We're gonna be alright

Baby don't you know
All of them tears gon' come and go
Baby you just gotta make up your mind
That every little thing is gonna be alright
Baby don't you know
All of them tears gon' come and go
Baby you just gotta make up your mind
We decided

We're gonna be alright
Hey yeah
We're gonna be alright
Yeah
Hey!
We're gonna be alright

We're in slow motion
Can't seem to get where we're going
But the high times are golden
Cause they all lead to better days

We're gonna be alright
Hey!
We're gonna be alright
Yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
We're gonna be alright

Baby don't you know
All of them tears gon' come and go
Baby you just gotta make up your mind
That every little thing is gonna be alright
Baby don't you know
All of them tears gon' come and go
Baby you just gotta make up your mind
We decided

We're gonna be alright
Hey!
We're gonna be alright
Ooooh baby
Ooooh yeah
Oh yeah
We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright
