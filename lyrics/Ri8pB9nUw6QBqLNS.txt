How this night is still and sweet
with flowers on every tree
peace comes to them on quiet feet
but it doesn't come to me
Come to me

Come to me

I just listen to his heartbeat (Listen to his heartbeat)
right under my cheek (Right under my cheek)
I hear it so it must be in there (It must be in there)
it's so hard to see

I just listen to his heartbeat
I just listen I just listen
I just listen to his heartbeat
I just listen I just listen

How warm the air feels to my skin
in the trees the crickets sing
peace comes to every living thing
but it doesn't come to him (Come to him)

I just listen to his heartbeat (Heartbeat Heartbeat)
right under my cheek (Right under my cheek)
I hear it so it must be in there
it's so hard to see

I just listen to his heartbeat
I just listen I just listen
I just listen to his heartbeat
I just listen I just listen

His peace is hidden with his fate (Heartbeat)
next to his song and keys
love's hidden in a lonely place
will it ever be in me?
be in me?
