I watch you sleep
You look so peaceful
You look so vulnerable
I feel scared for you

To me you're precious
May you always
Shine like stars
Shine like stars
Shine like stars

I watch you dance
You look so happy
Lost in the moment of abandon
You're set free

To me you're precious
May you always
Shine like stars
