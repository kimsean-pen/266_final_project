Years ago
When I had a chance
I could've held your hand
But I was young and then I blew every circumstance
Yet I still think
I dream of dancing, dancing whith you, with you
And maybe even share a drink or two
While I tell you the truth
That I don't even care what this is for
As long as I get to share the floor
With you, with you... With you

(...)

In my troughts and dreams I do a little swayin' away
Swayin' away with you
Even if I know it'll never realize
Maybe one day I'll wake up
Maybe some day it'll be true
Maybe that day I'll be
I'll be
dancing dancing with you, with you
And maybe even love you a little more
While we tango across the floor
And I don't even know when I'll see you again
I'll keep living this dream 'till the end
With you, with you... With you
