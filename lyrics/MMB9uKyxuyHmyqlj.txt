I can't keep my head straight, tweakin' off a perky now
Leanin' like a sensei, I can't feel my body now
My bitch she a Ruger, she like 40 somethin'
Twelve round drum on her, she Gisele Bundchen
I can't keep my head straight, tweakin' off a perky now
Leanin' like a sensei, I can't feel my body now
My bitch she a Ruger, she like 40 somethin'
Twelve round drum on her, she Gisele Bundchen

Pulled up to the plug house and I was already slumped
Copped a hunned pack of 30s, ain't no seal, then I can't touch
All these drugs up in my system, can't seem to just get enough
Now my vision blurry, can't see these haters when they be mud
My bitch hatin', all these perkies and xannies, they keep me numb
I can't even function if I ain't just smoked a blunt
Hoe this ain't no flexin', just sickness and I be stuck
Please don't try and copy, you'll end up in the mud
Woke up to Opana and a cigarette for the lunch
Cherry chew, hopin' not to feel a rush
This what keep me sane, when I'm down, who gon' pick me up?
Used to keep me sane, when I'm down, who gon' pick me up?
So I been on my own, too, fuckboy I don't owe you
You ain't even has been, you was never poppin'
Homies try to feed you, you was still out robbin'
I ain't fuckin' with you, tell me, how's the bottom?

I can't keep my head straight, tweakin' off a perky now
Leanin' like a sensei, I can't feel my body now
My bitch she a Ruger, she like 40 somethin'
Twelve round drum on her, she Gisele Bundchen
I can't keep my head straight, tweakin' off a perky now
Leanin' like a sensei, I can't feel my body now
My bitch she a Ruger, she like 40 somethin'
Twelve round drum on her, she Gisele Bundchen

I can't keep my head straight, tweakin' off a perky now
Leanin' like a sensei, I can't feel my body now
My bitch she a Ruger, she like 40 somethin'
Twelve round drum on her, she Gisele Bundchen'
I can't keep my head straight, tweakin' off a perky now
Leanin' like a sensei, I can't feel my body now
My bitch she a Ruger, she like 40 somethin'
Twelve round drum on her, she Gisele Bundchen'
