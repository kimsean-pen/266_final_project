Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

If you could blow up the world
With the flick of a switch
Would you do it?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

If you could make everybody poor
Just so you could be rich
Would you do it?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

If you could watch everybody work
While you just lay on your back
Would you do it?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

If you could take all the love
Without giving any back
Would you do it?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

And so we cannot know ourselves
Or what we'd really do

With all your power
With all your power
With all your power
What would you do?

With all your power
(With all your power)
With all your power
(With all your power)

With all your power
(With all your power)
What would you do?

(No, no, no)
If you could make your own money
And then give it to everybody
Would you do it?
(No, no, no)

If you knew all the answers
And could give it to the masses
Would you do it?
(No, no, no)

Are you crazy?
It's a very dangerous thing to do
Exactly what you want?

Because you cannot know yourself
Or what you'd really do

With all your power
With all your power
With all your power
What would you?

With all your power
(With all your power)
With all your power
(With all your power)

With all your power
(With all your power)
What would you do?
Do, do, do
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Yeah, yeah, yeah

With all your power
(With all your power)
With all your power
(With all your power)

With all your power
(With all your power)
What would you do?
(What would you do?)

With all your power
(With all your power)
With all your power
(With all your power)

With all your power
(With all your power)
What would you do?

With all your power
(With all your power)
With all your power
(With all your power)

With all your power
(With all your power)
What would you do?

I quit, you, you, I didn't make it
All the way through that
