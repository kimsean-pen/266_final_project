It's always around me, all this noise
But not nearly as loud as the voice saying
Let it happen, let it happen
It's gonna feel so good
Just let it happen, let it happen

I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
And when it happens, when it happens
I'll be holding on
So let it happen, let it happen
It's gonna feel so good

It's gonna feel so good

It's always around me, all this noise
But not nearly as loud as the voice saying
Let it happen, let it happen
It's gonna feel so good
Just let it happen, let it happen
It's gonna feel so good

I will not vanish and you will not scare me
Try to get through it, try to bounce to it, try to bounce to it
All the while thinking I might as well do it
Why would I do it?
They be lovin' someone and I'm not that stupid
Take the next ticket to take the next ticket, to take the next train
Why would I do it?
And you wanna think that, and you wanna

Let it happen, let it happen
Let it happen, let it happen

All this running around
Trying to cover my shadow
A notion growing inside
Now all the others seem shallow
All this running around
Bearing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm
It must be morning

It's gonna feel so good

Let it happen, let it happen
Just let it happen, let it happen
It's gonna feel so good

Good, good, good, good...
