I'm half-awake
Stretched out and reached against the cold
These lung escapes
I know your weakness
In the fold, where we fall
I was unbound and you were born
In silence, I lie
I wanted for the night
I'll break the blindness
You hide it
It wasn't mine to take the wildness
In silence, I lie
I wanted for the night
I'll break the blindness
Stop whining, it wasn't mine to take your life
In the time I formed you, we get high
In the fold, where we fall
In the time I formed you, we get high you leave alone
In the fold where we fall
One night there were signs
These are not your walls, they're mine
How'd we let it all warp?
Silo, the pick up road
Don't you know that I was all alone in it all?
In silence, I lie
I wanted for the night
I'll break the blindness
You hide it
It wasn't mine to take the wildness
In silence, I lie
I wanted for the night
I'll break the blindness
Stop whining, it wasn't mine to take your life
In silence, I lie
I wanted for the night
I'll break the blindness
You hide it
It wasn't mine
To taste the wildness
In silence, I lie
I wanted for the night
I'll break the blindness
Stop whining, it wasn't mine to take your life
