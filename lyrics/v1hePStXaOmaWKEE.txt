Yes, I loved
More than I supposed
To love
And then
I finally realized
That she didn't love me

Then I cried
Knowing that our love
Had died
Will I ever love again
Or will it hurt eternally?

It was then, when my life
Was sad and blue
That I found
My world in you
Now I wonder no longer
Of a chance
You're the reason
Of living through romance

Ooh, looooove
Ooh, looooove
I'm so glad
That I found you
