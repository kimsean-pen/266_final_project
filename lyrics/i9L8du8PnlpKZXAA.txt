Are the stars up tonight?
I don't care if it's cloudy or bright
'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear
Now the moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
'Cause I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here, so am I

Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you

How can I live a day without you?
I need your love to see me through
But you're not here by my side

Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes
I only have eyes
Only have eyes for you

Only have eyes for you
Are the stars up tonight?
It could be cloudy or bright
Eyes so blue, kisses true
I never knew what they could do
