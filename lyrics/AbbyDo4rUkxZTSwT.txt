Hold on tight to your dream, yeah
Hold on tight to your dream, yeah
When you see your ship go sailing
When you feel your heart is breaking
Hold on tight to your dream.

It's a long time to be gone
Oh, time just rolls on and on
When you need a shoulder to cry on
When you get so sick of trying
Just hold on tight to your dream.

When you get so down that you can't get up
And you want so much, but you're all out of luck
When you're so downhearted and misunderstood
Just over and over and over you could.

Accroche-toi à ton rêve
Accroche-toi à ton rêve
Quand tu vois ton bateau partir
Quand tu sens - ton coeur se briser
Accroche-toi à ton rêve.

When you get so down that you can't get up
And you want so much, but you're all out of luck
When you're so downhearted and misunderstood
Just over and over and over you could.

Hold on tight to your dream, yeah
Hold on tight to your dream, yeah
When you see the shadows falling
When you hear that cold wind calling
Hold on tight to your dream.
Ooh, yeah, hold on tight to your dream
Yeah, yeah, hold on tight...
To your dream.
