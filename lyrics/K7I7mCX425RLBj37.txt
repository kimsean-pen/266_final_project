I count absolute zero
The same way I'm held hostage
Tonal oblivion
No rooms in this desert made of light
Their emblems built of garbage
Those wheels emphatic colors
Tonal oblivion
No rooms in this desert made of light

No credit
No blame
Process is the gain

Without these gods and heroes
Whose words will hold you hostage
His canvas choked with words
Drops of inks to douse a desert fire
It brought us back to page
I see myself in bondage
Outside a house in flames
I'm blessed to burn into a desert fire

She's unseen completely
Let me under your wing
The sun destroys me
She's unseen completely
Let me under your wing
The sun destroys me

No credit
No blame
Process is the gain

I count absolute zero
The same way I'm held hostage
Tonal oblivion
No rooms in this desert made of light
Their emblems built of garbage
Those wheels emphatic colors
Tonal oblivion
No rooms in this desert made of light

She's unseen completely
Let me under your wing
The sun destroys me
She's unseen completely
Let me under your wing
The sun destroys me
(The sun destroys me)

The sun destroys me, the sun destroys me
The sun destroys me, the sun destroys me

The sun destroys me, the sun destroys me
The sun destroys me, the sun destroys me
