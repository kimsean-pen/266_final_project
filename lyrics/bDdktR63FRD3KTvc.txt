Only a few notes, like a flute
Only a few words in a strange tune

The voice from the choir sings quietly
The voice from the choir haunts me

On the road to the clinic, I hear it
On the way back from the clicnic,
It's still with me

The voice from the choir sings quietly
The voice from the choir haunts me
