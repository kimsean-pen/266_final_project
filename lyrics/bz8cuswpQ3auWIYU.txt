Something about your body makes me feel so safe
I want you on top of me like a paperweight
Don't be too busy for me, its a Saturday

I like to give you a hard time, hope that's okay, (hope that's okay)
I memorize your voice and every single phrase
We never grew out of that "too much PDA"
The genesis of all us started in the rain
I hope it grows into a forest, just the same
Just the same
Say something
Say you see me
Like I see you
If you believe me
I'll believe you
Just the same

Whisper something to me, make my heat beat race
I can't concentrate with your arms round my waist
Forget your other obligations, it can wait
I like to be your main priority, this place
We learned all about each other it took one day
I know almost everything you love an hate
The genesis of all us started in the rain
I hope it grows into a forest just the same, just the same
Say something
Say you see me
Like I see you
If you believe me
I'll believe you

Try to count each star in the sky
If you're gonna ask me how much I
Love you, it's the same
Just the same
Just the same
Just the same
Just the same
Just the same
Just the same
Just the same
Just the same
Just the same
Just the same
Just the same

Try to count each star in the sky
If you're gonna ask me how much I
Love you, it's the same
Just the same

Say something
Say you see me (just the same)
Like I see you (just the same)
If you believe me (just the same)
I'll believe you

Try to count each star in the sky
If you're gonna ask me how much I
Love you, it's the same
Just the same
Just the same
Just the same
Love you, it's the same
Just the same
Just the same
Just the same
