Staring at the sun
No rays down on me
I call you in my arms
Embrace is unreal

You're moving on
We'll never be apart
Just drain my tears
I cry aloud

You're moving on
You'll never be a part
Of all the tears
I've cried aloud

Calling on your sins
You're here in my dreams
A desert place
I'm not alone

Do you really
Want to be me?

You're moving on
We'll never be apart
Just drain my tears
I cry aloud

You're moving on
You'll never be a part
Of all the tears
I've cried aloud
