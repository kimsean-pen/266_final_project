It's a struggle with a failures frown
And it crashes in front of me
I see the clouds divide
Will you stay or try to leave

The time you're looking at the door
And think to walk right through
I want to ignore
I only wish that it passes soon

Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating

I raise a sunken smile
As I serve the ones who served
What can I achieve
As you steal the air I breathe

It's a cruel misfortune
Forbidding is to see
When stories may collide
It's a sad state of mind

Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating

Hearts beating for the last time
(Hearts beating)
Hearts beating it is a state of mind
(Hearts beating)
Hearts beating for the last time
(Hearts beating)
The peace you cannot find
