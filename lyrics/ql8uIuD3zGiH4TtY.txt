Swimming fast
Hone in on the buzz in ways you could not
I like you real silver-like
Oh see them fast, take off at last
And we get better

I wanna breathe in a sunlight beam
I wanna be with a girl like she

I'm swimming fast (swimming fast enough)
Hone in on the buzz in ways you could not
Know my own electricity
You did this to me
I want someone to carry me
Oh Ill-advised, your desire
Tulip bell

And I'd rather be a satellite
And I'm picking up the phone

Remember when?
It was then we sealed to unlock never again
The way we might on movie night
Suspend disbelief
And this is much better
I can see you crying
None of these remedies, I feel
Could make things matter that much
It's only right on movie night
Solemn summer

And I'd rather be a satellite
And I'm picking up the phone
Picking up the phone
(stay up, satellite)
(You were always shy)

Eleven past (eleven past of us)
I love all the things that are wrong with you
Know my own electricity
You did this to me
I like you real silver-like
Oh see them fast, take off at last
And we get better

And I'd rather be a satellite
And I'm picking up the phone
(and the sun would shine)
(stay up satellite)
Picking up the phone

My life is my own
And now I'm always home

That's where I spend my time
What, you think I'm up all night?
That's where I spend all my time
What, you think I'm up all night?
