This over complex new design
I'm tripping over all the time
We try to walk a fragile line
Whatever's left is always right

I will take back what's rightly mine
This is my godforsaken fight
We're gonna set this place alight
bring it on tonight

Bring it Bring it on tonight.
Bring it,

This over complex new design
I'm tripping over all the time
We try to walk a fragile line
Whatever's left is always right

I will take back what's rightly mine
This is my godforsaken fight
We're gonna set this place alight
bring it on tonight
tonight, tonight

I'm tripping over all the time
We try to walk a fragile line
Whatever's left is always right

I will take back what's rightly mine
This is my godforsaken fight

Bring it,
Bring it on tonight.
Bring it.
