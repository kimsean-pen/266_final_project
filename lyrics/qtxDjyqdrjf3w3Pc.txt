Wake up and fall apart
open your eyes and fall apart
wake up!

wake up, just wake up
the truth is closer than you imagined
wake up!

wake up, don't be so blinded
open your eyes, just open your eyes
wake up!

reality pulses, the truth is so close
counts down our time, counts down our time
wake up!

wake up, the time has come
open your eyes, open your eyes
every day seems like a distorted dream
wake up
