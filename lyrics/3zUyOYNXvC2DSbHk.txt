Heaven must be missin' an angel
Missin' one angel, child, 'cause you're here with me right now
Your love is heavenly, baby
Heavenly to me, baby

Your kiss with tenderness
I want all I can get of your sexiness
Showers, your love comes in showers
And every hour of the hour
You let me feel your loving power

There's a rainbow over my shoulder
When you came, my cup runneth over
You gave me your heavenly love
And if one night you hear crying from above

It's 'cause heaven must be missin' an angel
Missin' one angel, child, 'cause you're here with me right now
Your love is heavenly, baby
Heavenly to me, baby

Ooh, heaven, heaven
Ooh, heaven, heaven
Ooh, heaven, heaven
Heaven, heaven

Ooh I'm captured by your spell
You're different, girl, I can tell
When you're layin' on my pillow, baby
Above your pretty head, there's a halo, that's why I know

Heaven must be missin' an angel
Missin' on angel, child, 'cause you're here with me right now (Mmm ha)
Your love is heavenly, baby
Heavenly to me, baby (Ooh my sweet little angel)
Heaven (My pretty little angel)

Heaven (I love you, love you, love you,
love you, love you, baby, say right now)
Heaven
Heaven (Ooh heaven)

Heaven, heaven (Must be missing an angel)
Heaven, heaven
(Missing one angel, child, 'cause you're here with me right now)
Heaven, heaven (Oh, my heaven)
Heaven (Missin' an angel)

Heaven
Heaven
You must have slipped away along the Milky Way
It's 'cause your kiss
You came C.O.D. on a moonbeam straight to me
Just like showers
Your heavenly power gets stronger by the hour
Heaven must be missin' an angel
I'm captured by your spell, oh, girl, can't you tell

Heaven (Heaven) must be missin' an angel
Heaven, heaven (Ooh ooh)
Heaven, heaven (Ooh ooh)
Heaven, heaven (Ooh)

Heaven, heaven (Ooh so-so good, so-so good, so-so good, baby, mmm)
(Yeah)
(I love the way you move, I love the way you groove)
(Uh)
(Just like heaven, oh, baby)
(Heaven, yeah)
Heaven, heaven
Heaven, heaven (Ooh, my heaven)
Heaven, heaven (Ooh, your love is so good)
Heaven, heaven (Oh, baby, got to have my love, yeah)
Heaven, heaven (Need it bad, Lord, baby, yeah)
Heaven, heaven (I got to have my love, yeah)
Heaven, heaven
