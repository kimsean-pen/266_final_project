I remember him say she moves like honey
Like a smoke drift by her car
Lift the white dress off her shoulder
I remember the way she calls him sweetly
Driving down on the empty streets
Waiting for the day to leave

I once was always hesitation
But these days love and salutation
I once was always trepidation
But these days I need your conversation

I could count on the days he's taking the high road there
Reminiscing when the times get hard
About the girl on the boulevard
Next on the run Lola runs quickly
When they ask us how they got this far
I am not done before I told them off

I once was always hesitation
But these days love and salutation
I once was always trepidation
But these days I need your conversation

Gaze that he wears upon his sleeve is sparkling
They're making the way the city is sleeping
Waking up at the stars above
With the scarlet smile on
At the end of it all the night's still breathing
Sharing times when they got older
Lift the white dress off her shoulder
