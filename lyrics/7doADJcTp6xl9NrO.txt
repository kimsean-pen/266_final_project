You are the smartest rat in the sewer
You know all the nooks and the cracks, to allure
Unsuspecting mice, they don't have to think twice
You are the smartest rat, in the sewer
Come on come on down into the pull
Oh my darling you'll be alright,
it was just for one night,
see what it's like on the other side

I will hate you forever
I will hate you forever
Scum bag, sleeze, slime ball grease,
You really do disgust me

Your love is like a crooked old
Entice you in, elegantly styled
I knew you we're bad all along
But still I swam in to welcoming jaws

Oh, come on come on down into the pull
Oh my darling, you'll be alright
See what it's like on the other side
I will hate you forever
I will hate you forever
Scum bag, sleeze, slime ball grease,
You really do disgust me

I will hate you forever
I will hate you forever
You really do disgust me
You really do disgust me
