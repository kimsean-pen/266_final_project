Forced, no escape, left to rot

Forced to be taken from your family
Mandatory
War fucking preparation, no escape, dominate

Serve your time, trapped and caged
You have been surrounded
A decade with mindless militant

Suicidal exit path
Selfish thoughts, family lost
Cork and triggered sets you free
Time has served, now wait and bleed

The broken man is free
