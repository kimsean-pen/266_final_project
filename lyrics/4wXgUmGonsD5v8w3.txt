I Feel the scenes
Already in motion
the pressure is there
it surrounds our senses
now here we sit
in our satellite of love
back to our senses
with traces above
the vision is there
it surrounds us
back to our senses
satellite of love

now look outside
out on the air
no longer waiting
time will abide
the wind rises
feel its bite
gently persuading
pass on tonight

now here we sit
in our satellite of love
no longer waiting
no longer waiting
the vision is there
it surrounds us
back to our senses
satellite of love
