There's a guy at the door wearing black eyeliner
There's a birthday girl goin' for an all-nighter
And the frat boys knockin' back shots with the bikers
Just another night with a buncha outsiders, yeah

All the neon signs lighting up our faces
Grab another round, add another for the waitress
The kick drum kicks in loud and our song's comin'
Through the speakers thumpin' all night long
All night long

Everybody sways
To the beat while the record plays
Everybody knows
How it goes
Woah, oh, oh
Hands up in the air
Nobody cares
We don't stop for anything
Around here
Everybody sings
Everybody sings

We're dancing like fools with the music blasting
Trying not to spill the drinks in our glasses
No, we're not goin' home 'til the taps run dry
We're all shining in our own spotlight
Singing every line
It feels so right

Everybody sways
To the beat while the record plays
Everybody knows
How it goes
Woah, oh, oh
Hands up in the air
Nobody cares
We don't stop for anything
Around here
Everybody sings
Everybody sings

Singin'
Stomping our feet
Hands on our hips
It's gotta be
As good as it gets
Stomping our feet
Hands on our hips
It's gotta be
As good as it gets
Stomping our feet
Hands on our hips
It's gotta be
As good as it gets
Stomping, stomping
Shaking, shaking
It's gotta be
As good as it gets

Everybody sways
To the beat while the record plays
Everybody knows
How it goes
Woah, oh, oh
Hands up in the air
Nobody cares
We don't stop for anything
Around here
Everybody sings
Everybody sings
