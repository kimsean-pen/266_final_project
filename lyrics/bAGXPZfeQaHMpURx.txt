Friday night the 13th and the ruins of a crow
Dark figures come together for an awful vow
They have sworn to Satan to celebrate a black mass
Damned rites are prepared, black angels they bless

Demon and devil, the preacher's peril

Snakeblood and poison, the cauldron is boiling
To condemn the holy cross, black rites are soiling
Witches are dancing around the altar
Praying to their master to celebrate the holy war

Demon and devil, the preacher's peril

Since million years religion keeps knowledge of the dark
The church discloses sacred rules to mark
They are full of ignorance if they don't realise
That there is more than they can see of religious size

Demon and devil, the preacher's peril
