Baby, are you late or you missed by your ticket?
We're supposed to be on our way to happy endings
So, where we turned wrong?
It seems we have lost our way
Oh, is this simple, we shouldn't even argue with it
Every argument turns to us within
Then you say that you're leaving when you know that you should stay
Uh, I could've sworn this love she was easy
That's what the bold say
They don't tell you when you're a little girl and
When it don't work out that way
And I, I, I, I think we missed the love train
Uhm, hmm, baby, I, I, I, I, I say we need to start all over again
Then the next one is the last one, I'm waiting on you

I'm missing the quickies and days on the weekends
We'd be loving for hours, and loving for days in
What happened to us? I wanna be that way again
Oh, when the [?] came along we got complicated
And we both said some things but didn't mean it
What happened to love? I know our hearts will meet
I could've sworn this love she was easy
That's what the bold say
They don't tell you when you're a little girl and
When it don't work out that way
And I, I, I, I think we missed the love train
Uhm, hmm, baby, I, I, I, I, I say we need to start all over again
Then the next one is the last one, I'm waiting on you

Pack your bag, you only need one
Leave the others in the past,
'Cause they don't belong where we're going to
I ran after this train for you
Wanna leave out this pain right to Paradise
Restless, set this, don't stop, you don't hurt the train
To get back to the better days
But baby, I, I, I, I think we missed the Love Train
And baby, I, I, I think we need to start all over again
The next one is the last one, I'm waiting on you, you youu youu

Don't miss the next one, I'm waiting for you
Don't miss, do-do-don't
Do-do-don't
Do-do-don't
Don't miss all the train
Do-do-don't
Do-do-don't
The next one is the last one, I'm waiting on you, you youu youu
