A problem
Here comes a problem
You let down your friends
And you let down the people
And you let down yourself Oh oh oh oh
And only fools, vultures and undertakers
Will have any time for you

A Problem, here comes a problem
When you lie to your friends
And you lie to your people
And you lie to yourself
And the truth's too harsh to comprehend
You just pretend there isn't a problem

I am a pimp and they say
And in my bed you dig my bed
I dig my grave

The truth's too hard to comprehend
You just pretend there isn't a problem
No I ain't got a problem
It's you with the problem
