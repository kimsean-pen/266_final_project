Down by the river, where the green grass grow
And the sun be burning (hot)
Take your pantyhose, don't nobody know where you go
Just know the block just got hot

When you see a drink, gotta be sweet
Gotta be quick, gotta get get 'fore you get got

I see him lookin', around my way
He like my body, don't see my face
And with them girls, gonna pay to play

Next thing that I know, I was leanin', he was????

So I (gotta make a quick decision)
Gotta get, get out my pill and see that (money on the floor)

(My back is achin', my bra too tight
My booty shakin', from left to right)
