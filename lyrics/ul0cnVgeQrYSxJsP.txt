Always on my mind
You're always on my mind
Thoughts of you all the time
You're always on my mind

Everyday I see ya with a lovin' eye
I just want to hold ya and make you mine
If you listen to me now, sweet baby
I'll make a promise that you can hold me too

No matter how far and no matter how wide
(I promise)
I promise, baby that I'll stay by your side
(I'll stay right by your side)
'Cause in my mind I see you
And I just can't seem to shake you
Your sweetness to me is worth not thinkin' of

Always on my mind
(You're always on my mind)
You're always on my mind
(Thoughts of you)
Thoughts of you all the time
(All the time)
You're always on my mind

It's the way you look at me
The sight of you knocks me off my feet
I wanna kiss and tell and get to know you well
Let me introduce my heart to you

No matter how far and no matter how wide
(I promise)
I promise, baby that I'll stay by your side
(I'll stay right by your side)
'Cause in my mind I see you
And I just can't seem to shake you
Your sweetness to me is worth not thinkin' of

Always on my mind
(Always on my mind)
You're always on my mind
Thoughts of you all the time
You're always on my mind

Always on my mind
(You're always on my mind)
You're always on my mind
(Thoughts of you)
Thoughts of you all the time
You're always on my mind

No matter how far and no matter how wide
(How wide)
I promise, baby that I'll stay by your side
(I'll stay right by your side)
'Cause in my mind I see you
And I just can't seem to shake you
Your sweetness to me is worth not thinkin' of

Always on my mind
(Always on my mind, sweet baby)
You're always on my mind
Thoughts of you all the time
(Thoughts of you)
You're always on my mind

Always on my mind
(Thinkin' of you)
You're always on my mind
Thoughts of you all the time
(Thoughts of you)
You're always on my mind
