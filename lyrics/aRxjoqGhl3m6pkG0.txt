And when it's cold out
I will wait for her
And I will roam out
To the edges of the earth
And when it feels just like the rain
Has soaked through my bones
None of this will matter
None of this will save you from yourself

This life
It's brining on the death of me
Swear that I can barely see
That I'm the one to blame
This life
I swear to God it's killin' me
Seems some times I can't believe
That I'm the one to blame
And when it's cold out
In the sleet and snow
I will hold out
'Till the answers all unfold
And when it feels just like the rain
You will see through it all
None of this will matter
'Cause none of this will save you from yourself

None of this will matter
None of this will save your from yourself
