The chance that he ever reaches any place
Suitable to support life in his lifetime is pretty low
(Get low) pretty low (get low) pretty low (get low) pretty low (get low)
And the chances of him of ever seeing anybody
That he knows are even lower so he's making up his mind to just go
(Let go) just go (let go) just go (let go) just go (let go)

So it's one shot in the arm (one shot in the arm)
Hazy in the head (hazy in the head)
Set the timer once (set the timer once)
Lay down in the bed (lay down in the)
Close the hatch trying to clear your mind
Cause nightmares alarm blowing [?]
If you have a God say something sublime
Deep breath and leave it behind you ready to jump

Be right here when you wake up
(Jump) be right here when you wake up
(Jump) be right here when you wake up
(Jump) be right here when you wake up
(Jump) there'll be no here when you wake up
(Jump) there'll be no here when you wake up
(Jump) there'll be no here when you wake up
(Jump) there'll be no here when you wake up

Slow blood
Slow blood
Slow
Blood

Somewhere in sleep is a brainstorm
And the EKG spikes and the
Nerves fire like flies lightly and
Die slightly each night alright alright alright

It's an artifact apparently
Similar to a muscle memory
And he grabs her ropes and chokes back songs like
Tear like stars like gears and moving
Pictures picture perfect

Paint a perfect picture perforate it
Rip it up into a thousand jagged edges
He's embarrassed of the love he has
For things you never knew
Didn't you know

Happiness is waiting at your door
In a sleek black dress and a kiss that says "hello"
And a thick black mess and a mam that says "don't go"
And a cul-de-sac so cold it'll hold you close when the
Stores all close and the clothes so thin to begin with
When the wind rips they blow

Pretty low (get low) pretty low (get low) pretty low (get low) pretty low (get low)
Just go (Let go) just go (let go) just go (let go) just go (let go)

Slow blood
Slow blood
Slow blood

I follow the stars when the sun goes to bed
Everything I've ever known is long dead
I can't go back home cause I want to be free
Someone tell the others what's become of me
