Well it's Halloween again
And LA is a bore.
Everybody's lookin' like they wish they'd stayed inside.
And they were watchin' Frankenstein on their beds and on their phones.
Not me baby. Tonight I'm really livin'.
I'm a vampire again and I'm coming for you.
Open up your window, cause I'm about to sail in.
You can call for Mama, but she won't know what to do.
I'm a vampire again, mmm.
It's been long time waiting, but I'm happy to reveal.
I can smell you from a thousand yards, fresh white linen.
Felt like only yesterday, I was as wicked as Woody Allen,
Now I stand as proud and tall as the home where you were born.
I'm a vampire again and I'm coming for you, so keep that window open.
I'm a swooper, and you know it.
Cry for Mama, but she won't know what to do.
I'm a vampire again, mmm.
But, it's me Babe. It's really me.
Chappoy! I hope you've been keepin' sweet for me,
Cause I woke up a hunger.
Midnight glory.
You won't feel a single thing until the year 2025.
Oh. Oh.
