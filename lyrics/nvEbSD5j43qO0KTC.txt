Please don't tell me to leave
I am only here to make it better
To make it better
Haven't you been waiting
For someone to come
For someone to come and pick you up
From the bottom of your heart
It is time for you to realise
That changes will come
That changes will come if you don't believe
That change makes you strong
Just believe it
If change makes you strong
From change you'll be young again
Yes
You will be young again

Now we'll? tears off of your cheeks
Push? eachother
Sometimes life hurt
Sometimes man can be?
Who wants a?
But in time you will realise
That changes will come
That changes will come if you don't believe
That change makes you strong
Just believe it
If change makes you strong
From change you'll be young again
Yes
You will be young again

Young again
Young again
Young again
Young again
Young again
Young again
Young again
Young again
