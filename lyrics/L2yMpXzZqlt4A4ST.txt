Oratorio in grey scrolls patiently from the top
A strip of iron peeled out of a thread
Discrete assimilation fouls me like the House of Usher
A pet in your goldfish bowl but for you I only float dead

Feel visible matter
Feel invisible matter
There is death in everything
We are connected without reason at all

You have your way with me like a lover
But I spite you because I just want the end of the world

Oratorio in grey scrolls patiently until it stops
