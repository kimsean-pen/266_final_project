Every day and every night
Streets leave their mark on my skin
The city breaks you down
Reach inside its upside down, I cant find anyway out
To throw away your promises, speak in tongues, don't reach inside my head

Every day and every night
Blood red cancer across my flesh
You cant see beyond your face
Reach inside its upside down, I cant find anyway out
So throw away your promises, speak in tongues, can't find a head

So quit while your still ahead

Reach inside its upside down, I can't find anyway out
So throw away your promises, speak in tongues, can't find my head

And every day, and every night
And every day
