I love women, I think they are great
They're a solace to the world in a terrible state
They're a blessing to the eyes, a balm to soul
What a nightmare to have no women in the world
I love women
We all love women
I used to look at women in the magazines
I know that it was sexist, but I was on the sly
I couldn't keep my hands off women
And I won't till I die
I love women
We all love women
A woman's love can lift you up, and women can inspire
I feel like buying flowers and hiring a celestial choir
A choir of castratis to serenade my love
They'd sing a little Bach for us and then we'd make love
I love women
I love women
We all love women
We love women
