Anytime that you're thinking of me
That you might want me, I come on over
Don't you know, anytime, anyplace, I am yours

You're a lesson that I love learning
So anytime that you've got a yearning
Don't you know, anytime, anyplace, I am yours

You're the one I belong to, the one thing that feels true
Everything that I could ever want
If you ever need me, I'm waiting on you
To arrive through the door, anytime, anyplace, I'm yours

If you're hoping for second chances
Of stolen kisses, I got the answer
Don't you know, anytime, anyplace, I'm yours

You're the one I belong to, the one thing that feels true
Everything I could ever want
If you ever need me, I'm waiting on you
To arrive through the door, anytime, anyplace, I'm yours

You're the one I belong to, the one thing that feels true
Everything I could ever want
If you ever need me, I'm waiting on you
To arrive through the door, anytime, anyplace, I'm yours
Anytime, anyplace, I'm yours
