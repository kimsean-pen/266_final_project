Sorry boy, even not that loud
Doesn't mean I'm out
But a word could ruin it
Sorry, boy, gotta slow it down
Better shut your mouth
Do the talking with your lips?

I'm right on the edge
And I know how to swim, but I'm not jumping in
Not scared to get wet
But if we dip our feet, I know we'll go too deep

Don't want a good heart to break
When we're touching, those three little words feel too easy to say
But, but I'm not ready
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way

In the way, oh way oh way oh
In the way, oh way oh way oh
In the way, in the way, oh way oh way oh
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way
The words only get in the way
The words only get in the way

Like you lots, I just had a thought
We could make it fun, doesn't have to have a name
Everyone puts the pressure on
But we're not everyone, so we don't have to do the same

I'm right on the edge
And I know how to swim, but I'm not jumping in
Not scared to get wet
But if we dip our feet, I know we'll go too deep

Don't want a good heart to break
When we're touching, those three little words feel too easy to say
But, but I'm not ready
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way

In the way, oh way oh way oh
In the way, oh way oh way oh
In the way, in the way, oh way oh way oh
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way
The words only get in the way
The words only get in the way

Don't want a good heart to break
When we're touching, those three little words feel too easy to say
But, but I'm not ready
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way

In the way, oh way oh way oh (in the way)
In the way, oh way oh way oh (only get in the way)
In the way, in the way, oh way oh way oh (only get in the way)
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way
The words only get in the way (get in the way)
The words only get in the way
