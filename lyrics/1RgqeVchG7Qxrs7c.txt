They have left the world,
The singing is over
Trees on graves in an embrace
An angel on the gates,
Memorial day
A girl with the wreath in her hands

Where are you and the others?
Where are you and the others?
Where are you and the others?
Where are you and the others?

Lord has left the world,
Who's on the way?
A calm pale face on a crucifix
An angel on the gates,
Memorial day
A girl with the wreath in her hands

Where are you and the others?
Where are you and the others?
Where are you and the others?
Where are you and the others?
Where are you and the others?
Where are you and the others?
Where are you and the others?
Where are you and the others?
