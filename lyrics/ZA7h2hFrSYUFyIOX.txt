I'll give you misery, 'cause you know what it feels like
I'll give you happiness, 'cause you want it all to yourself
I'll give you all of me, it'll take just a moment
And of our everything, but all you get is what you see

You turned my insides out
You turned my insides out
Yeah

You make me sick, so that you can heal
And I'll make myself numb so that you can feel
My reflection must be somebody else
'Cause I don't recognise myself

I'll take your loneliness, 'cause I know what it feels like
All your uncertainty, I'll make into mine
I'll take your punishment, 'cause I think I deserve it
All your never ending condescending arguments
So lay me out on your table
Let's get straight to the heart of this

You turned my insides out
You turned my insides out
Yeah

You make me sick, so that you can heal
And I'll make myself numb so that you can feel
My reflection must be somebody else
'Cause I don't recognise myself

You turned my insides out
You turned my insides out
Yeah

You make me sick, so that you can heal
And I'll make myself numb so that you can feel
My reflection must be somebody else
'Cause I don't recognise myself
No, I don't recognise myself
No, I don't recognise myself
