As I swallow the tears of lava
Rolling from my eyes
I can feel the spite
Hurting me inside

As I write, my life's unfolding
The tip of my finger
Stuck straight in the air
Raindrops everywhere

When will this nightmare, will it stop
Moving forward as I walk
Moving forward as I walk

As I feel
My toes lift off
My head touching the clouds
I can feel the rain
Hurting me again

When will this nightmare, will it stop?
Moving forward as I walk
Moving forward as I walk

What is this wild fire inside me?
I wanna throw it out
But they won't let me

When will this nightmare, will it stop?
Moving forward as I walk
Moving forward as I walk

Tears of lava
My tears of lava
My tears of lava
My tears of lava
