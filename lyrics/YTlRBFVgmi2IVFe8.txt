ProtoMech

Devoid and broken within
I lost human origin
Erased and disgraced, desensitized
I have been dehumanized

Corrupt and deface
Judge to be damned
Speak out, eradicate
Species of man

My life has ceased to exist
Designed to be ProtoMech
Detach, extract my mind to dissolve
Alive death comes to us all

Corrupt and deface
Judge to be damned
Speak out, eradicate
Species of man

Take everything away from me
Replace my skin with circuitry
All that I have bleeding from me
To feed the machine

My life is taken to feed the machine Devour energy, destroy all life

Synthetic insurrection
Genetic isolation
Programmed elimination
Robotic evolution

Take everything away from me
Replace my skin with circuitry
All that I have bleeding from me
To feed the machine

My life is taken to feed the machine Devour energy, destroy all life
