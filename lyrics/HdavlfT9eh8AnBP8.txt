Many a life I've tried
Many tear I've cried
Your heart is a twisted vine
That loves but
None at a time

You see,
None at a time

I see you have a lady
She brings you your bread and your wine
And your heart is a twisted vine
That comes but once in a while
To me
Once in a while

Where are you?
Sweet Marie
I'm floating on an apple tree
And I'm telling all the world
That I once knew
That I'm in love with you

Where are you?
Sweet honey
I'm floating on an apple tree
And I'm telling all the world
That I once knew
That I'm in love with you

Many a life I've tried
Many tear I've cried
Your heart is a twisted vine
That loves but
None at a time

You see,
None at a time

Where am I?
Sweet Marie
I'm floating on an apple tree
And I'm telling all the world
That I once knew
That I'm in love with you

Where are you?
Sweet honey
I'm floating on an apple tree
And I'm telling all the world
That I once knew
That I'm in love with you
