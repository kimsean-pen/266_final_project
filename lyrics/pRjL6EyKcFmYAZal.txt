Let me in to see you
in the morning light
To get me on
and all along the tears they come
See all come,
I want you to believe in life
But I get the strangest feeling
that you've gone away
And when you find out who you are
its too late to change

I wish I could be
every little thing you wanted,
all the time
Oh, I wish I could be
every little thing you wanted,
all the time, sometimes

Lift me up,
just lift me up dont make a sound
Let me hold you up
before you hit the ground
See all come,
you say your alright
But i get the strangest feeling
that you've gone away,
you've gone away
And when you find out who you are
too late to change

I wish I could be
every little thing you wanted,
all the time
Oh, I wish I could be
every little thing you wanted,
every thing you wanted,
all the time

Don't give me up
Don't give me up tonight ohh
Soon nothing will right at all,
salvation
Cause when you find out who you are
too late to change

Too late to change

I wish I could be
every little thing you wanted,
all the time

Oh, I wish I could be
every little thing you wanted
every little you wanted
all the time

This time,
everylittle thing you wanted
all the time, oh
But I get the strangest feeling
that you've gone away
