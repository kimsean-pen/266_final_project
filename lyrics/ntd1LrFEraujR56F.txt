I had no advantage over you
There was troubles and I had 'em too
Just 'cause you're so stung out
Don't mean it can't work it out

(Ba-ba-banana)
This ain't Havana
Do you like bananas
(Ba-ba-bananas)

Say you're a victim of society
You ask them for their mercy
Just like the cats in the garbage cans
When's their time coming, man

You better offer some resistance
You better give up on my insistence
Things happen overnight
You don't give up without a fight

(Ba-ba-banana)
This ain't Havana
Do you like bananas
(Ba-ba-bananas)

You say you're poor and uneducated
You ain't gotta chance 'cause you're hated
You're on your way to life's promotion
You hinder it with emotion

You better offer some resistance
You better give up on my insistence
Things happen overnight
You don't give up without a fight

I had no advantage over you
There was troubles and I had 'em too
Just 'cause you're so stung out
Don't mean it can't work it out

(Ba-ba-banana)
This ain't Havana
Do you like bananas
(Ba-ba-bananas)

(Ba-ba-banana)
This ain't Havana
Do you like bananas
