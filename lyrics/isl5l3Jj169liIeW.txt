I stare down at the ground that's under me
What has become of me? My life is crumbling
It's almost like you knew how to fuck with me
You've taken enough from me, you try to ruin me

I'm feeling like I'm sliding below like there's no hope
I'm dying alone and I'm so low
I'm trying to show another side of me I hide, denying to know
I feel your knife, it's slicing my throat like a chokehold
You're tightening the rope as I grow cold
I'm fighting to hold, another part of me has died, I'm finding control

Every time you say you don't believe in me
It doesn't mean a thing, I won't go quietly
Every time you say that nothing lies beneath
Look and you'll finally see what's inside of me

I thought that bleeding would be the death of me
Make something less of me, it was stressing me
But now I'm leaving behind the rest of me
The part that's affecting me, the part that was my destiny

I'm feeling like I'm sliding below like there's no hope
I'm dying alone and I'm so low
I'm trying to show another side of me I hide, denying to know
I feel your knife, it's slicing my throat like a chokehold
You're tightening the rope as I grow cold
I'm fighting to hold, another part of me has died, I'm finding control

Every time you say you don't believe in me
It doesn't mean a thing, I won't go quietly
Every time you say that nothing lies beneath
Look and you'll finally see what's inside of me
Look and you'll finally see what's inside of me
Look and you'll finally see what's inside of me

The day will come and
Now you'll see, you'll finally see
Now you'll finally see what's down inside of me
I'm finished hiding these dying dreams so quietly
Now you'll see, you'll finally see
No more silencing; for me, it's time to breathe
Although you try to squeeze the life from me so violently

Every time you say you don't believe in me
It doesn't mean a thing, I won't go quietly
Every time you say that nothing lies beneath
Look and you'll finally see what's inside of me
Look and you'll finally see what's inside of me
Look and you'll finally see what's inside of me
