The things I know
The things I know
Never have the same glow passing through your rainbow
Ooh oh oh
The things I feel
Never have the same hold
'Till I've finally found you

Now you make me feel like choosing Love against doubt
Love against doubt
'Cause I want to fade out with you

I would fear nothing
I would fear nothing
'Cause I want to fade out with you

I would fear nothing
I would fear nothing
The things I hear

Never have the same sound
'Till I've finally found you
Now you make me feel like choosing love against one

Love against one
'Cause I want to fade out with you
I would fear nothing

I would fear nothing
'Cause I want to fade out with you
I would fear nothing

I would fear nothing
Things I know never have the same glow passing through your rainbow
The things I feel never have the same hold

'Till I've finally found
'Till I've finally found you
Things I hear never have the same sound
Things I hear never have the same sound
'Till I've finally found
'Till I've finally found
'Cause I want to fade out with you
I would fear nothing
I would fear nothing
'Cause I want to fade out with you
I would fear nothing
I would fear nothing
