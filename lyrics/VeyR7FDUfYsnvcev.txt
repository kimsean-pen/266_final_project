I wonder when I wander home
If I'll be fit to drink alone.
Sleep with my memories,
Pictures, apologies.

For every minute yesterday,
Regret reminds me anyway.
If I remember anything,
I'll make mistakes again.

Last night on the Mass Pike,
Thought I was losing you.
Last night on the Mass Pike,
I fell in love with you.

I will declare a holiday,
The night that she turned me away.
I'm drowning in my miseries...
It solves everything.

Last night on the Mass Pike,
Thought I was losing you.
Last night on the Mass Pike,
I fell in love with you.
With... you--.

Last night on the Mass Pike,
Thought I was losing you.
Last night on the Mass Pike,
I fell in love with you.

Last night on the Mass Pike,
Thought I was losing you.
Last night on the Mass Pike,
I fell in love with you.
