All your life has been rambling, scurrying
Take your time rather than hurry
Never too late to write the rest of your story
Remember to breathe or else you're gonna be sorry
Life's no race, it's a companion
Always face with reckless abandonment
A ticket to life as the mother once told me
Stick with your pride and you're gonna be lonely

Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train
The blue sky's we wait on
Are gonna have to come after the rain

Spend your days happy and grateful
Avoid the taste of wanting and wasteful
Every good thing will come in moderation
Envy and greed will only lead to frustration
Choose your friends, carefree and kindly
Choose your words, careful and wisely
Always be there to lend a comforting shoulder
One will be there and share when you're older (when your older)

Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train
The blue sky's we wait on
Are gonna have to come after the rain

Old mistakes committed upon us
Always take a toll on the conscience
Every regret is a gift that you live with
Never forget to remember forgiveness

Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train
The blue sky we wait on
Are gonna have to come after the rain

Gonna have to come after the rain (ra-ai-ai-ain)
Gonna have to come after the rain (ra-ai-ai-ain)
Rain, yeah
Ra-ai-ai-ain
Gonna have to come after the rain
