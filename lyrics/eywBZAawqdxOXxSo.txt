Amid the gate, he stares at my door
How long did I see him stay?
Days or months, I couldn't say
Yet it bustles me, and what for?

I swear I saw him moan
But my window's thick and cloudy
And I won't disdain a sentry's duty!
Fleeing my home for venture lone!?

Amid the gate, he stares at my door
How long did I see him stay?
Days or months, I couldn't say
Yet it bustles me, and what for?

That drone haunts me from abroad
A middle tone, a new norm
A safe zone, applauding form
My yard is steep and deep, thank God!

You moan
I saw you moan
You moan
I saw you moan
