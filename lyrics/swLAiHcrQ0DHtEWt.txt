Maybe I hang around here
A little more than I should
We both know I got somewhere else to go
But I got something to tell you
That I never thought I would
But I believe you really ought to know
I love you
I honestly love you
You don't have to answer
I see it in your eyes

Maybe it's better left unsaid
But this is pure and simple
You must realize
That it's coming from my heart and not my head
I love you
I honestly love you
I'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortable
I'm not trying to make you anything at all
But this feelin doesn't come along every day
And I shouldn't blow my chance
When I got the chance to say
I love you I love you
I honestly love you
If we both were born
In another place in time
This moment might be ending with a kiss
But there you are with yours
And here I am with mine
So I guess we'll just be leaving it at this
I love you
I honestly love you
I honestly love you
