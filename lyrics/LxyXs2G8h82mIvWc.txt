A part of me always believed
I must have brought this on myself
'Cause I'm not where I want to be
And every time I want to change my life
It just feels like trying to turn water into wine

It doesn't have to be a world away
I can hear the song like it's inside of me
I know that if I get to know my pain
I unlock a hundred different doors to better
days

Though I take hit after hit
I realise the higher reason is accepting challenges as gifts
And through the fight
I never really knew that I would find myself
That's why I give my thanks to you

It doesn't have to be a world away
I can feel the sun like it's inside of me
I know that if I get to know my pain
I unlock a hundred different doors to better days

My life is what I make it
I choose to rise and take it from your hands
My life is what I make it
I choose to rise and take it from your hands

This is not my punishment
This is my catalyst for growth
I know I will survive this
I'll be the strongest person I know

It doesn't have to be a world away
I can see the light like it's inside of me
I know that if I get to know my pain
I unlock a hundred different doors to better days

My life is what I make it
I choose to rise and take it from your hands
My life is what I make it
I choose to rise and take it from your hands

This is not my punishment
This is my catalyst for growth
I know I will survive this
I'll be the strongest person I know
