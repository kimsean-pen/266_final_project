This is that jammer, jammer
Go Anthem-Banana-Getter
You got a question, I'll answer for llama
Mama I'm better
But better p-put ya bets up
Trendsetter said get her cheddar
Chincillas, feathers and leathers
AB, AB, the two letters

About my bread 'til dead up
I plan to blam on all hammers
Long weave out the limo
Nananananananana

They want my photos and pictures
Inside of they candid cameras
Bloggers, critics, and scandals
Man-handle-savage, I'll damage ya!

Real bitch, all day
Uptown, Broadway
Real bitch, all day
Uptown, Broadway

That cannon, cannon could damn ya
Ya aunties nana's and grandmas
They all jamming the jammer
Come join in and put ya hands up
Let's go!

Reefer in cabanas
All my vehicles handsome
The Muellers with the bezels
I bought 'em to spoil the fellas
These bitches and they banter
Fuck is up with they grammar!
They never talking money
I can't ever understand 'em

That cutie, cutie, bam beauty
That juicy, juicy who truly pack
Tooly's oozies in Gucci's
You fruity tootie n' bootie
Don't make me remove ya kufi
I do it cause it's my duty
Crazy and kinda spooky!
Yo boobie step up ya coochie!

Rude bitch, all day
Uptown, Broadway

All of my bitches bougie
Designer vagina coochie

They flying, they tryna scoop me

Reefer in cabanas
All my vehicles handsome
The Muellers with the bezels
I bought 'em to spoil the fellas
These bitches and they banter
Fuck is up with they grammar!
They never talking money
I can't ever understand 'em
