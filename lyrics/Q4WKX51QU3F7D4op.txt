Every time I listen to
The voices you put in me
They tell me to get out of here
They tell me to get free
I go out I feel I can't stop
Feeling so empty
So come on won't you join me
Won't you please, please, please

Be with me

Summers day, fun and sweat
To the beach we flee
Lets all jump into the waves
Lets all praise the sea
Open up my treasure chest
Filled with seaweed
If I give everything to you
Will you please, please, please

Be with me
