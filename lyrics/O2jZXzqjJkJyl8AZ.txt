Do ya like good boogey
Like the real boogey woogie
Hear the juke box singin'
Get the dance hall swingin'
Won't ya grab my shaker
Got to meet your maker
Um-get out the lead, get out of bed, get the lead out
(get ready) i'll show you my fist
(get ready) take hold of my wrist
(get ready) we really can't miss
(get ready)
Oh, hey good lookin'
What ya got there cookin'
You a young spring chicken
A-make your feet start kickin'
No no, no no
Oh, hey good lookin'
What ya got there cookin'
You a young spring chicken
Make your feet start kickin'
Boot it out, dance without me
