I'm alright tonight
(I'm alright)
You're alright tonight
(I'm alright)
We're alright tonight
(It's alright tonight)

You came down a twisted up road
You've been travelin' for light years
You got here the same time
Those tears found their way down your face
I fought with the laws tooth and nail
And I traveled by night, dear
You're a sight for sore eyes
I've been looking all over the place

Up where the angels sigh
Down where the dreams get smashed
On the rocks, you and I
Wait to begin again
Lifted above by a love
(Ooh)
That does not end

I'm alright tonight
I'm alright
You're alright tonight
You're alright
We're alright tonight
It's alright tonight
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

You picked up some pieces of light
As you broke through the speed of sound
I was rockin' around in my own
Two dimensional way
Now when I hear
(Ooh)
That jet engine blow
Then I know you are leavin' town
Baby, I'd follow you
To the edge of it all anyway

Up where the kingdom comes
Down where the streets take the breath
Of another young gun
Love is a whispered prayer
Shot like a spark
Through the heart of dark despair
(Uh)

I'm alright tonight
I'm alright
You're alright tonight
You're alright
We're alright tonight
It's alright tonight

I don't regret any nineteen year old indiscretions
(Uh)
I can still fit both my feet in my mouth anyway
(Uh)
But these days I'm just not as willing to nurse the obsession
(Uh)
(No, no, no)
If the doc says it's got to come out
Then I'm happy to pay

I'm alright tonight
I'm alright
You're alright tonight
You're alright
We're alright tonight
It's alright tonight

I'm alright tonight
I'm alright
You're alright tonight
You're alright
We're alright tonight
It's alright tonight
(Oh my love)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

I'm alright tonight
I'm alright
You're alright tonight
You're alright
We're alright tonight
It's alright tonight
(It's alright, we're eager)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

I'm alright tonight
I'm alright
You're alright tonight
You're alright
We're alright tonight
It's alright tonight
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

I'm alright tonight
I'm alright
You're alright tonight
