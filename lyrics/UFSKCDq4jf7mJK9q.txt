From the beginning
Small lifeforms
They can kill without warning
So you don't explode

Stop your growing limbs and thinking
That you love them now you're blinking
And reminding her of him

Oh you steal his features
And your mother is a bleacher
She don't even feel the heat no
She don't even want to speak to you

But you, you always find another place to go
(Oh you) you always find another womb, to grow
To grow

Well you can try to sink down deeply
And find the children lost at sea
Find the children who discretely
Be killed in infancy

To stop them holding you and screaming
That you'll lose your wildest dreaming
Still reminding you of him
How he left without reasons

But you, you always find another place to go
(Oh you) you always find another womb, to grow
To grow

You can try to forget but I won't let you easy
You can try to forget but I won't let you easy
I'm floating out in the water washed out to sea
Drifting away this time you'll regret you've conceived it
Clean up the dead you leave behind
Just like insects

Clean up the dead you leave behind
