This was the last goodbye
You were on the steps in the hollowest of lights
I kept dying
Strung out on the faults of forever
Feel the fading light
I believe the cold now the cormerants inside
I was your wildness
Til the war ripped wide above us

You needed love, I needed water
We call the kindness off
You keep it all, I keep the covers
Til we burn down the home
I leave a war, you leave it open
I leave the carve out the stone
These weren't wars
They were just wanderings
Into the void
That the heave up holds

Fill up your heaving sky
With salamander light
Fill up those heaving skies
When the world ripped wide above us

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

You needed love, I needed water
We call the kindness off
You keep it all, I keep the covers
Til we burn down the home
I leave a war, you leave it open
I leave the carve out the stone
These weren't wars
They were just wanderings
Into the void
That the heave up holds
