Run
Rise
Burn me
Reducing the stigma
Born to live in this house of shame
While I dig the grave
On my path to find faith
You weren't there while I was dying
You're the reason I'm feeling so deranged
I will stay here and haunt you forever
Why always staring into the light?
If I don't hide inside the darkness
You'll be compromised
But sometimes you will fly with me again
Without falling
Without falling
Rise
Read my words
Run
Mark my words
I'm bedridden here
Locked outside of my faith
Incurable
Captured by time
You're the reason I'm feeling so deranged
I will stay here and haunt you forever
Why always staring into the light?
If I don't hide inside the darkness
You'll be compromised
But sometimes you will fly with me again
Without falling
Without falling
I told you to leave me alone
I told you to leave me alone
I told you to leave me alone
I told you to leave me alone
Take my soul
Sometimes you will find me there again
Without mourning
Without mourning
Sometimes you will fly with me again
Without falling
Without falling
Rise
Read my words
Run
Mark my words
