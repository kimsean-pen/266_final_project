Defy and comply

We will have to take control
Sanguinary rules will never abide
We're at the mercy of the ways
If we keep denying our true nature
Face your challenge

We stand and fight until the end
Turn your demons into shadows (into the shadows!)
We shall exhaust all that you fight
Fight your demons now
We've got no other way than to hide (your darkest side)

When our destinies collide
Our intrinsic values cry out for action (never stay aside)
Only emptiness remains
If we can't get rid of our frustration
Judging someone tells you who you are

We stand and fight until the end
Turn your demons into shadows (into the shadows!)
We shall exhaust all that you fight
Fight your demons now
We've got no other way than to hide

So slow
So low
Face your fears

A vision from another life
Will change our world forever

Judging someone makes you face your challenger

We stand and fight until the end
Turn your demons into shadows (into the shadows!)
We shall exhaust all that you fight
Fight your demons now
We've got no other way than to hide

Our cruel thoughts won't escape, fight until the end
Turn your demons into shadows (into the shadows!)
All judgement, this madness breeds all that you fight
Fight your demons inside
We've got no other way than to hide
Fight your demons now!
