And I'll bet you never thought
You'd live to see the day
Where we could play
With joy and laughter
And I'll bet you never thought
We'd make it all the way
And we could stay
Forever after
But I guess we proved you wrong
And I guess we showed 'em all
We paid our dues Getting up off the floor
And I guess we proved you wrong
And I guess we showed 'em all
So much to lose Walking right out the door
Music is worth living for
Music makes life worth living
Music is worth living for
Music is worth living for
Music makes life worth living
Music is worth living for
A higher power that I can't deny
Music makes me feel so high
Like the glorious sound of God
Coming down like a lightning rod
Give me the will to love
So below and as above
The only way that I'll survive
Music makes me want to stay alive
And I'll bet you never thought
We had the strength inside Yeah,
we almost died And we kept on going
And I'll bet you never thought
The pain was justified
But we found our pride
And we kept it growing
But I guess we proved you wrong
And I guess we showed 'em all
We did our best
We played until our hands were sore
And I guess we proved you wrong
And I guess we showed 'em all
Never gunna rest
We're always gunna go for more
Music is worth living for
Music makes life worth living
Music is worth living for
Music is worth living for
Music makes life worth living
Music is worth living for
A higher power that I can't deny
Music makes me feel so high
Like the glorious sound of God
Coming down like a lightning rod
Give me the will to love
So below and as above
The only way that I'll survive
Music makes me want to stay alive
