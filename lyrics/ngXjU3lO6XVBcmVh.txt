All my gray skies turn to blue
All my gray skies turn to blue

I am a sunshine

When I look at you
All my gray skies turn to blue

When I look at you
All my gray skies turn to blue

When I look at you
All my gray skies turn to blue

I am a sunshine

Don't you ever let me down
Only you can wear my crown
All that, I love you so
By this day you should know

When I look at you
All my gray skies turn to blue

All my gray skies turn to blue
All my gray skies turn to blue
All my gray skies turn to blue

I am a sunshine
