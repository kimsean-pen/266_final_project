It's your turn now,
they left me waiting all alone and I said they run.
It's my fault, no
Cos' they knew i'd give it up and I said they run.
I should go, I should leave
You don't know you're not asking me
I should go, they wont learn,
i'm told it's my turn.
Am I alone or is this me in the zone of my head again? I don't care.
I don't believe it when you tell me that it's
alright i'm overthinking things, my dear, I don't care.
I should go, I should leave. You don't know, you're not asking me.
I should go, they wont learn I'm told it's my turn.
It's my turn.
I should go, I should leave, you don't know, you're not asking me.
I should go they won't learn.
I'm told it's my turn.
