What a man
You know it's a bright and shiny day
I want to say something to you
I love you just like Ja do

We know a place
Where Ja's people can run free
A new kind of love
And we call it agape

Don't take too long to find
True love transcends all time
That non-reacting, everlasting love

Give me your unconditional love
The kind of love I deserve
The kind I want to return

Give me your unconditional love
The kind of love I deserve
The kind I want to return

Don't try to change
Or tear your brother down
Let him make his mistakes
And he will come around

Hasten just to pray
And Ja's true word obey
In non-reacting, everlasting love

Give me your unconditional love
The kind of love I deserve
The kind I want to return

Give me your unconditional love
The kind of love I deserve
The kind I want to return

Give me your unconditional love
My torn heart to discern
This agape love to learn

Everybody say
Give me your unconditional love
The kind of love I deserve
The kind I want to return

Give me your unconditional love
My torn heart to discern
This agape love to learn

Hasten just pray
And Ja's true word obey
In non-reacting, everlasting love

Give me your unconditional love
The kind of love I deserve
The kind I want to return

Give me your unconditional love
The kind of love I deserve
The kind I want to return

Give me your unconditional love
The kind of love I deserve
The kind I want to return

Give me your unconditional love
My torn heart to discern
This agape love to learn

Give me your unconditional love
My torn heart to discern
This agape love to learn

Give me your unconditional love
My torn heart to discern
This agape love to learn
