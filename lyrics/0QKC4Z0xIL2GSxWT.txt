take one, to come
doctor's orders, no more borders
take one, make some
feeling bolder, no more disorder

mother's not to blame
she's feeling no pain
doesn't feel the drain
she says it's not her brain

all right, no wrong
she used to be cleanin', now she's just dreamin'
she's right, you're wrong
she thinks it's the weather, feels light as a feather

mother's such a mess
she forgets how to dress
she thinks she's lookin' her best
she's no longer depressed

take one, bake one
used to be tragic, now it's like magic
just one, for fun
mother's new pet, it's not hard to get

mother came home today
wearing a big bouquet
she threw her self away
she's taking up spanish ole
