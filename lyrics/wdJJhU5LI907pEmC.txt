Create upon my flesh
Create approach upon my breath
Bring me salvation if I fear
Take my freedom

Create upon my breath
Create reflection on my flesh
The wealth of love
Bear me a witness to the years
Take my freedom
Let my freedom up,
Let my freedom up
Take my freedom
For giving me a sacred love

(Instrumental)

Create upon my flesh
Create a home within my head
Take my freedom
Let my freedom up,
Let my freedom up
Take my freedom
For giving me a sacred love
