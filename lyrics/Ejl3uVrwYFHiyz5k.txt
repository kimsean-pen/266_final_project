You look in my eyes and I get emotional, inside
I know it's crazy but, you still can touch my heart
And after all this time., you think that I, wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing and nothing's changed

I still believe
Someday you and me will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
Someday you and me will find ourselves In love again

Each day of my life, I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I, I'm not the desperate type
If there's one spark of hope, left in my grasp, I'll hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning, to have a second chance

No, no, no, no, no, no, I need you, baby
I still believe that we can be together
No, no, no ...
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again

I still believe
Someday you and me, will find ourselves in love again
(Oh, baby, yeah, yeah)
I had a dream
You and me, will find ourselves in love again

(I still believe) oh, baby, I do
(Someday you and me) just give me one more try
In love again
(I had a dream) I miss your love
(Someday you and me)
Will find ourselves In love again
(I still believe)
(Someday you and me) will find ourselves in love again
