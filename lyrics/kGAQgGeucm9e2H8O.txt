Ooh, short and sweet
No sense in draggin' on past our needs
Let's don't keep it hangin' on
If the fire's out, we should both be gone
Some people are made for each other
Some people can love one another for life, how 'bout us?
Some people can hold it together
Last through all kinds of weather, can we?
Now don't get me wrong
(what are you saying to me baby)
'Cause I'm not tryin' now to end it all
(let's start something new)
It's just that I have seen
(what have you seen?)
Too many lover's hearts lose their dreams
(we won't lose it)
Some people are made for each other
Some people can love one another for life, how 'bout us?
Some people can hold it together
Last through all kinds of weather, can we?
How 'bout us?
How 'bout us, baby?
How 'bout us?
How 'bout us, baby?
Are we gonna make it girl?
Or are we gonna drift and drift and drift together?
ooh lover
Some people are made for each other
Some people can love one another for life, how 'bout us?
How about us, baby
(some people can hold it together)
Some people can hold it together
(last)
How about us?
Some people
(some people are made for each other)
(some people can love one another for life)
Some people can love one another for life
(how about us?)
How about us, baby?
(some people can hold it together)
Some people can hold it together
How about us?
How' bout us, baby?
(some people are made for each other)
(some people can love one another for life)
Some people can love one another for life
You and me, baby
(some people can hold it together)
Hold it together
(last)
Can we?
Say that we can make it, baby
(some people are made for each other)
Ohh
(some people can love one another for life)
