She does a little thing with her eye that says, "We're off soon."
She says the bleeding's incidental 'cause she's so cool
She says it's no fun if you've only a bottle of wine

And now she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time

Slow down
Yeah, I want you

She started talking about missing him
She was glistening
It won't mend your heart if it's only a couple of lines

And now she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
