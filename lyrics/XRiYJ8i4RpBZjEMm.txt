What's in your hand
You're pinned down to routines
Elevate and leave
The flickering screen

Where nothing is compromised
Nothing is lost
When everything is realized
Nothing is crossed

But don't let it pass
Don't get locked in
Everything starts
Way from within

Where nothing is compromised
Nothing is lost
When everything is realised
Nothing is crossed

But don't let it pass
