The world was on fire and no one can save me but you
Strange what desire will make foolish people do
I'd never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you
No, I don't want to fall in love
No, I don't want to fall in love
With you
With you
What a wicked game you play
To make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do
To let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say
You never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do
To make me dream of you
And I, I don't want to fall in love
No, I don't want to fall in love
With you
With you

No, ah I don't want to fall in love
No, ah I don't want to fall in love
With you
With you
Nobody loves no one
