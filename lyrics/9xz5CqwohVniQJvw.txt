Just because we're not alone
You echo words you've heard
You let me go just to watch me discern
Just because it feels the same, til the morning comes
Even roads fill the sun so cold

Just because we're not alone
You echo words you've heard
You let me go just to watch me discern
Just because it feels the same, til the morning comes
Even roads fill the sun so cold

Just because we're not alone
You echo words you've heard
You let me go just to watch me discern
Just because it feels the same, til the morning comes
Even roads fill the sun so cold

Just because we're not alone
You echo words you've heard
You let me go just to watch me discern
Just because it feels the same, til the morning comes
Even roads fill the sun so cold

Just because we're not alone
You echo words you've heard
You let me go just to watch me discern
Just because it feels the same, til the morning comes
Even roads fill the sun so cold

Just because we're not alone
You echo words you've heard
You let me go just to watch me discern
Just because it feels the same, til the morning comes
Even roads fill the sun so cold
