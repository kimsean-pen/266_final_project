But that's only while I think of you
Some vision that I hold on to
You know it's everything I do
You know it's everything I do

Can almost stand competing with the others
Can almost hear the fun
That I should be having
Instead of just dreaming

But it's only when I think of you
The mover I could turn into
There must be something I can do
Yeah, there must be something I can do

I just don't know how to feel right
A beautiful girl is wasting my life
I'm playing a part as somebody else
Trying so hard to be myself
Just need to hear somebody say
"This will all make sense one day"
Guess I'm alright, they're all doing so well
What I would give to be under that spell

You'll know soon
You'll know soon
You'll know soon
You'll know soon

But you don't know the truth
I really love you
You just don't believe
Anything I do

In so many ways, I'm somebody else
While trying so hard to be myself
I just need to hear somebody say
That this will all make sense one day

Well, it's getting late
I'd better go
I made it this far
As far as I know
