Uuuh, everything
... A picture
Tell me how you want it
Tell me ...
Tell me what ...
Maybe I don't wanna listen
Livin' on the water
it's just me
Don't tell me you don't feel me
Uh-uh x6
Uuuh, everything
Uh-uh x6
Uuuh, everything
I just wanna touch you
And hold you in my hands
I just wanna touch you
And feel you with my hands
Give everyone a chance
Give everyone a chance
Give everyone a chance
Give everyone a chance
