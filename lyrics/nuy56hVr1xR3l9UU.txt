Can't pretend that your nothing special.
You've got to look at all of your options.
You can't decide what to go for when it's all about trust.
It's all about trust.
You see yourself on the TV.
You read your magazines.
You can't explain how it's come to be this.
Stop and think when its all about trust.
It's all about trust.
Go!
This coverage your centre spread.
Your neon light daydream will shatter and break.

And if you think I'm thinking of your value.
You're the one... You're the one who's losing control.
Whoa...
This eventual stop this.
Break in the mold.

I scream down this hotline just to feel something.
This eventual stop this.
Break in the mold.
I scream down this hotline just to feel something.
This situation isn't getting any better.

I see the look in your eyes.
You want to see a pretty face the mirrors will lie.
There isn't anything wrong with giving up
and for what it's worth.
I still hate you.
Whoa...

This eventual stop this.
Break in the mold.
I scream down this hotline just to feel something.
This eventual stop this.
Break in the mold.

I scream down this hotline just to feel something.

Just to feel something.
Just to feel something.
Just to feel something.
Just to feel something.
Something! Just to feel something.
Something! Just to feel something.
Something! Just to feel something.
Something! Just to feel something.
This situation isn't getting any better.
I see that look in your eye.
This situation isn't getting any better.
I see that look in your eye.
This situation isn't getting any better.
I see that look in your eye.
This situation isn't...
We still fucked!
