I feel so numb staring at the shower wall
It's begun, the feeling that the end has come
And now the water's cold
I tried to eat today
But the lump in my throat got in the way

In this time, I've lost all sense of pride
I've called a hundred times
If I hear your voice I'll be fine

And I, I can't come alive
I want the room to take me under
'Cause I can't help but wonder
What if I had one more night for goodbye?
If you're not here to turn the lights off, I can't sleep
These four walls and me

I lay in bed, can't seem to leave your side
Your pillow's wet from all these tears I've cried
I won't say goodbye
I tried to smile today
Then I realised it's no point anyway

In this time, I've lost all sense of pride
I've called a thousand times
If I hear your voice I'll be fine

And I, I can't come alive
I want the room to take me under
'Cause I can't help but wonder
What if I had one more night for goodbye?
If you're not here to turn the lights off, I can't sleep
These four walls and me

Oh
Oh, and I, I can't come alive (can't come alive)
I want the room to take me under (oh)
'Cause I can't help but wonder (wonder what if I)
What if I had one more night for goodbye?
If you're not here to turn the lights off, I can't sleep
These four walls and me
