Say say my playmate
Wont you lay your hands on me
Mirror my melody
Transfer my tragedy

Got a curse I cannot lift
Shines when the sunset shifts
When the moon is round and full
Gotta bust that box, Gotta gut that fish (My mind's aflame)

We could jet in a stolen car

But I bet we wouldnt get too far
before the transformation takes
and bloodlust tanks and
crave gets slaked (My mind has changed)
My bodys frame but god I like it

My hearts aflame
My bodys strained but god I like it
My mind has changed
My bodys frame but god I like it

My hearts aflame
My bodys strained but god I like it
Charge me your day rate
I'll turn you out in kind

When the moon is round and full
Gonna teach you tricks that'll blow your mind, mongrel mind
Baby doll I recognize
You're a hideous thing inside
If ever there were a unlucky kind it's
you you you you
I know its strange another way to get to know you
You'll never know unless we go so let me show you
I know its strange another way to get to know you

We've got till noon here comes the moon
So let it show you, show you now
Dream me, oh dreamer down to the floor
Open my hands and let them weave onto yours
Feel me, completer down to my core
Open my heart and let it bleed onto yours

Feeding on fever down on all fours
Show you what all that howling's for
Hey hey my playmate
Let me lay waste to thee

Burned down their hanging trees
It's hot hot hot hot here
Got a curse we cannot lift
Shines when the sunshine shifts

There's a curse comes with a kiss
The bite that binds the gift that gives (we're howling forever oh oh)
Now that we got gone for good
Writhing under your riding hood
Tell your grand'ma and your mama too
It's true true true
We're howling forever oh oh
(we're howling forever oh oh)
We're howling forever oh oh
(we're howling forever oh oh)
we're howling forever oh oh
