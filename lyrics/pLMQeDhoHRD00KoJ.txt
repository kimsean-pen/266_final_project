You know, you must take a look at the new land
The swimming pool and
the teeth of your friend
The dirt in my hand
You know, you must take a look at me

Baby, baby, I know that's the way
Baby, baby, I know that's the way

You know
you must try the new ice cream flavor, do me a favor
look at me closer, join us and go far
And hear
The new sound of my Bossa Nova

Baby, baby, it's been a long time
Baby, baby, it's been a long time

You know
It's time now to learn Portuguese
It's time now to learn what I know
And what I don't know
And what I don't know
And what I don't know

I know, with me everything is fine
It's time now to make up your mind
We live in the biggest city of South America
Of South America, of South America
Look here, read what I wrote on my shirt

Baby, baby, I love you
Baby, baby, I love you
Baby, baby, I love you
Baby, baby, I love you
Baby, baby, I love you
You do
