Please, mother mercy
Take me from this place
And the long-winded curses
Are hear in my hand

The words never listen
And teachers, oh they never learn
But I'm warm from the candle
Though I feel too cold to burn

He came from an island
Then he died from the street
And he hurt so bad like a soul breakin'
But he never said nothin' to me, yeah

A'say hello to heaven, heaven, heaven
Say hello to heaven, heaven, heaven, yeah

New like a baby, lost like a prayer
The sky was your playground
But the cold girl was your bed

Ooh, I said, poor Stargazer
She's got no tears in her eyes
But flew like a whisper
She knows that love heals
All wounds with time

Now it seem like too much love
Is never enough, yeah, you better seek out
Another road 'cause this
One has ended abrupt, oh

A'say hello to heaven, heaven, heaven
Say hello to heaven, heaven, heaven, yeah
A'say hello to heaven, heaven, heaven
Say hello to heaven, heaven, heaven, ooo

I, I never wanted
To write these words down for you
With the pages of phrases
Of things we'll never do

Hey, so I blow out, out the candle
And I put you to bed
Since you can't say to me now
How the dog broke your bone
There's just one thing left to be said

Say hello to heaven, heaven, yeah
Say hello to heaven, heaven, yeah
Say hello to heaven, heaven, yeah
Say hello to heaven, to heaven yeah
Oh
