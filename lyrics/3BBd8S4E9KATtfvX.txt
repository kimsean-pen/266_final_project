Hello New York
Well there is something going down
Like the storm in the sky
I ain't gonna be played by your behavior

How can I trust someone who's lying to me
So bow out go now I said bow out and leave
I said take your stuff and run

'Cause you're not for me, no
Mamma knows best when times get hard
And Papa always has a joke to make me laugh
See Mamma knows best when I feel down

To bring me up and always keep my heels on the ground
See I ain't no old rag doll
That you can pick up and drop
And all of this inconsistent love yeah

I think it's time that it S.T.O stops
So bow out go now I said bow out and leave
I said take your bags and peace of

'Cause you're not for me, no
Mamma knows best when times get hard
And Papa always has a joke to make me laugh
See Mamma knows best when I feel down

To bring me up and always keep my heels in New York.
Just be the best my Daddy said to me
Always use humour as your therapy.
Don't ever take life too seriously.

Just do you 'cause you do you so perfectly (Mamma Mamma, Mamma Mamma)

Ay yeey yeeeh yeeeh yehhhhhh
See Mamma Mamma knows best
See Daddy Daddy knows best ...
See Mamma knows best when times get hard
And Papa always has a joke to make you laugh
See Mamma knows best when yes I feel down
To bring me up and always keep my heels on the ground
See Mamma Mamma knows best
See Daddy Daddy knows best

See Mamma Mamma knows best
See Daddy Daddy knows best
