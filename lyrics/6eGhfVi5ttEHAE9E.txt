Tonight, I felt stronger
Inside, of your way
It takes a lot to get home
But it's ok when the light is always on

I just want you to understand
There's no need to keep waiting
Another day and another hand
It could be so different

A letter to me, a waste of time
You know you could be yeah you could shine,
But tonight you'll get it right
You will make a difference

Chorus
Tonight (3), I feel stronger
Goodbye (3)
And I could see through, even from so far away
It's all you need to
Make it through another day

Surprise, scream your heart out
In time you will have doubt
Today it all seemed too strong
If only you tried you would move on

I just want you to understand there's no need to keep waiting
Another day and another hand it could be so different

A letter to me, a waste of time
You know you could be yeah you could shine,
But tonight you'll get it right
You will make a difference

Tonight (x3), I feel stronger
Goodbye (x3)
And I could see through even from so far away
It's all you need to
Make it through another day

Tonight (x3), I feel stronger
Goodbye (x3)
And I could see through even so far away
Its all you need to
Make it through another day, yeah yeah
