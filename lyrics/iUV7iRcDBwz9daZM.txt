If then i meet you along the way
Where the laurel trees surround us on every side
If then in a small place i stand alone
And turn my head and you smile there
If then i reach out and touch your form
Where all your silences and your chaos meets
Where everything joins and parts
If i may once clutch your heart
And pull its beauty to my face
There the bloodfall falls red river cracks
Behind me lies black mother mountain
The goats wheel round
Great sign of lust
How much i wanted you
And oh Christ how much more i want you now
The great pain
The great misery
To look and look
To look and look and look
And look and find
Nihil
