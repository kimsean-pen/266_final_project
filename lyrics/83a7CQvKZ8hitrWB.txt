Well, it's happening again
Oh well, it's happening again
I'm lost
In my thoughts again
I'm lost
In my thoughts again

Can we go back to your house?
'Cause I don't want to stick around
Can we go back to your house?
'Cause I don't want to stick around

Is this still a reality?
'Cause everything just seems so strange to me
I wonder if it's getting worse
Oh, I want to take you to the universe

Oh, I don't care what I'm supposed to believe
Sometimes I feel like I'm falling at the edge of a tree
Oh do you want to get
Out of this world, with me?

Yeah, every single day just feels the same
I know, I know, I know that it's time to change
Every single day just feels the same
I know, I know, I know that it's time to change

I know, I know, I know that it's time to change
I know, I know, I know that it's time to change
I know, I know, I know that it's time to change
I know, I know, I know that it's time to change
