The screen gets a window and makes it right
While I take out all the rubbish on who I don't like
There's nothing in 'ere, I'm just ignoring my kids
Spitting at some idiot I don't know from Leeds
He told me I was gonna get smacked
For the rest of the day I just thought about that
Should I get in the car and drive up there
Take my chances and get his address?

I got a tip from a random and where I should go
It was highly unusual but I was fuming, you know
I couldn't sleep at night with thoughts of pulling his tail
So I bought a uniform from Royal Mail
I know it sounds weird and it's not okay
But I got a good mate at the DVLA
So I threw him so cash and I got a postcode
And a door number and a fucking road
