Take a look inside, the warped and the sick
Forever born again, just to die so quick
The floodgates of the damned shall crash and burn once again

Nuclear obsession, the fall of the weak
Atomic demolition destroy all you seek
The floodgates of the damned shall crash and burn once again

Down, down, down, forever down
Down, down, down, forever down

Terrified reflections that rip through the sky
Apacalyptic birth, the screams and the cries
Floodgates of the damned shall crash and burn once again

The reverend of the grave, the mother of the end
The wings of the bastard shall spread once again

Down, down, down, forever down
Down, down, down, forever down

Down, down, down, forever down
Down, down, down, forever down
Down, down, down, forever down
Down, down, down, forever down
