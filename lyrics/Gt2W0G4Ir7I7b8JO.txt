You're my enigma
Why claim another life
When you're still ruling
A sea of corrupt minds
Feed from my weakness
I fear my hands are tied

Afflicted over and over again

This vicious cycle
It eats away
The very soul of this person you lead astray

Fighting this with every breath I breathe
When the smoke fills up my lungs
It's so hard, it's just so hard to see what's underneath
I lust for strength to just come clean
Or bite my tongue and let it bury me

I know there's a hell
Cause you're keeping me here
You're keeping me here
You're keeping me here

Fighting this with every breath I breathe
When the smoke fills up my lungs
It's so hard, it's just so hard to see what's underneath
I lust for strength to just come clean
Or bite my tongue and let it bury me

You're my enigma
Why claim another life
When you're still ruling
A sea of corrupt minds
Feed from my weakness
I fear my hands are tied

Afflicted over and over again
Fuck

I know I could have been a better me
I know I could have been a better me
