When it comes, it comes
with the suddeness of weight
Closing my eyes then to realize
how I've come to be without
I don't want to lose myself in loss
I want to plant that loss like a seed
deeper than the inside of me
to pull and protect me
repossess me again

When it comes, it comes
with the emptiness of hate
and regret
A present sacrified to a sanctified past
that's pointlessly asking
"Will it never taste this sweet again?"

I don't want to lose myself in loss
I want to plant that loss like a seed
deeper than the inside of me
to pull and protect me
repossess me again

Loss like a seed.
