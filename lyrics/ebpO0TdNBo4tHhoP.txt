Dancing like a chimney sweep
I look ridiculous
All hands and feet
The hat's on wrong
The hat's on wrong
The hat's on wrong
The hat's on
It's wrong, wrong, wrong, etc.
The skulls are just like stepping stones
The river's littered with little bones
The hat's on wrong
The hat's on wrong
The hat's on wrong
The hat's on
It is on wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong
It's on wrong, wrong, wrong
The grass is green
The sky is blue
My feet are bound in bamboo
The hat's on wrong
The hat's on wrong
The hat's on wrong
The hat's on
It's on wrong, wrong, wrong
It's on wrong, wrong
The hat is on wrong, wrong
My hat is on wrong, wrong
On my skull
Look at me, my hat is on wrong
My hat's on wrong
