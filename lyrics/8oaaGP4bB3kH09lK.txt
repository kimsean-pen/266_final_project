Here you come again
Just when forgot to get myself together
You waltz right in the door, just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger

Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes and light those dreamy eyes
And pretty soon I'm wonderin' how I came to doubt you

All you gotta do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind an' fillin' up my senses

Here you come again
Lookin' better than a body has a right to
An' shakin' me up so, that all I really know
Is here you come again an' here I go

All you gotta do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind an' fillin' up my senses

Here you come again
Lookin' better than a body has a right to
An' shakin' me up so, that all I really know
Is here you come again an' here I go

Here I go
An' here I go
An' here I go

Here you come again
An' here I go
Here I go
An' here I go
