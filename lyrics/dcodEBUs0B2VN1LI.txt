That's what she told me
That night, in the terminal
As we were boarding
And I know you meant it
Holding my hand so tight as
We flew, from Lafayette
Back to Pacific time
And you lay ya head
On my shoulder
Couple tears were shed over Arizona
An emotional roller coaster, yeah

We ride the highs and lows
We ride the highs and lows

You'll never be alone
Even when your world explodes
Cause after all the smoke clears
I will be right here
I will be right here
When the smoke clears

I will be right here
When the smoke clears

And when I hit the wall
Back in December
I took my hardest fall
But we fell together
And we spent the weekend
Pacing the hotel room at
The Westin, in Dublin
Never felt so close to you
And I laid my head
On your shoulder
By the time we left we were ten years older
An emotional roller coaster, yeah

We ride the highs and lows
We ride the highs and lows

You'll never be alone
Even when your world explodes
Cause after all the smoke clears
I will be right here
I will be right here
When the smoke clears

I will be right here
When the smoke clears

"You and I, against the world."
That's what she told me

We ride the highs and lows
We ride the highs and lows

You'll never be alone
Even when your world explodes
Cause after all the smoke clears
I will be right here
I will be right here
When the smoke clears
