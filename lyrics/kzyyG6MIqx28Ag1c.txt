It was dawn and I
Waited on the filter
So to typify
Said she called me mister
Under misty skies
Hit to get there quicker
Rebel through the night
'Cuz I truly missed her
Universal charm
'Cuz she thinks it's humour
And I mean no harm
Lie down into this
Fall back she says
Let's just keep this mutual
It's these lines I dread
Too much life force simple

Midnight mischief strolling through my mind
Caught you there but I left you behind
Midnight mischief strolling through my mind
It's my midnight mischief time

As the night awaits
I can see her sleeping
Stare down mistake
Does she know my secret?
I'm in love with her
Let the love manifest
Watch me take my serve
Does she know I'm master
Watch me take control
She doesn't know what hit her
Glimpses of her soul
As a seamless dinner
Numbers on the plate
It's my turn now
One minute to the hour

Midnight mischief strolling through my mind
Caught you there but I left you behind
Midnight mischief strolling through my mind
It's my midnight mischief time

Come back home to the place I like when it's over
I've been waiting all day
Never seem to hold myself and notice
It's a dangerous place
Used to care but I can see your holding (I'll wait for days)
For a better place (I'll wait for days)
Midnight mischief (I'll wait for days)
Creeping through the curtain

Midnight flow press rewind
My minds melody shows that tonight
Midnight flow press rewind
My minds melody shows that tonight
I'll wait all day for you, I'll wait for you
I'll wait all day for you, I'll wait for you
I'll wait all day for you

See I can't blame myself, I got the right of way
Midnight call me alright, my lover you take control
And I can't blame myself, I got the right of way
Midnight call me alright, my lover you take control
See I can't blame myself, I got the right of way
Midnight call me alright, my lover you take control
