Hi it's, me I'm bored again
All is well I'm not insane
I've been drunk for seven days
Everything is fine

I made some friends, broke the ice
Then I ate some bread and cheese
To gain some weight
Keep me warm everything's OK

It's me delivering psychosis
Over the phone to you
I color your world blue
Ten thousand miles from you
I'm sinking all alone
Treading new waters, I miss my buoy

The van smells like a dirty sock
Everyone has got the flu
I'd rather be sick of you
I'd rather be asleep

It's me delivering psychosis
Over the phone to you
I color your world blue
Ten thousand miles from you
I'm sinking all alone
Treading new waters, I missing my buoy

When I get home,
The band will have it's first hit song
You and I will buy some rings
And a suburban home
I'll bring home, the bacon bits
We'll make our parents grandparents
I'll take you out, to breakfast at night
And then we'll go to sleep
