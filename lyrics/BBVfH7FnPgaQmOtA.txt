If I could change the currents of our lives
To make the river flow where it's run dry
To be a prodigal of father time
Then I would see you tonight

If I could find the years that went away
Destroying all the cruelty of fate
I must believe that love will find a way
Tonight

Lonely finds me
One day you will come
But I'll wait for love's sake
One day to me, love

If I could see beyond the here and now
If you could hear me calling you somehow
If I could know that love is reaching out
To find you with me tonight

Then hope could make these promises come true
Beyond what I could say, what love can do
With every moment leading me to you tonight

Lonely finds me
One day you will come
But I'll wait for love's sake
One day to me, love

I will stay forever here until that one day comes
Praying time will bring you near, I'll wait for your love

If I could change the currents of our lives
To make the river flow where it's run dry
To be a prodigal of father time
Then I would see you tonight

Lonely finds me
One day you will come
But I'll wait for love's sake
One day to me, love

Lonely finds me
One day you will come
But I'll wait for love's sake
One day to me, love
One day to me, love
One day to me, love

I will stay forever here. I'll wait for your love
