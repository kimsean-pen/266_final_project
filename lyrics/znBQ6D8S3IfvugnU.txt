The liars, the cheaters
All dogs turned into wolves
You'd better hold onto your love
The anger, the pain
The violence, the shame
It's all so temporary

And there's nothing you could prove
With a blade on their throats
But the weakness of a pile of guts
You destroy the leash
To make it a chain
It's so unnecessary

For you'll know the failures of hateful hearts

Don't tell me what to do
Don't tell me where the fuck i come from
Violence is not a mission
And i surely cannot cope

Love is defiance
Defiance is necessary
Love is disobedience
Love is political

I see no medals on any of us
And still we're the ones who compete
We fight like roosters and on our heads they bid

I don't hate you
I just don't get it
