When I found you
You could run so fast
You never really wanted love
And it couldn't really hold you back
You were that speed train
And you were still on the run
Yeah you would crash right in
And then you'd just move along
Oh I know that it haunts me
Wishing you could just stay
Drive away if you want to
You can slow down babe
But you just can't wait

Don't you see?
You can try to fight it
But it's meant to be
You and me
Baby please
Don't believe
Anything they tell you
Right here
I swear
This is where you're meant to be
This is where you're meant to be
This is where you're meant to be
This is where you're meant to be

When you fly off
Yes you get so high
You never want to come back down
And you never really had to try
Baby all I know
And that I've come to find
You can the touch the sun
But you're never gonna kiss the sky
Oh I know that it haunts you
Wishing you could be there
Fly away if you want to
It's a new view babe
But it's the same air

Don't you see?
You can try to fight it
But it's meant to be
You and me
Baby please
Don't believe
Anything they tell you
Right here
I swear
This is where you're meant to be
This is where you're meant to be
This is where you're meant to be
This is where you're meant to be
