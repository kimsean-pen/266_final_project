Right now we're sick of everything
Tonight we'll bind up our brains again
With eyes pinned I'll fly around on your bed
We'll grow close while our hearts disconnect

Morning is limping into the room
Pleading that we bind ourselves again
Rip out that heliotropic rose
Back off please let the lost get lost

I know my faith has meaning
But I've forgotten why
It's so important to me
I can't remember why

Living a phantasm of the nerves
Girlfriends chemicals in your head
Good days eventually oxidize
Put them with thoughts that escape your minds eyes

I know my faith has meaning
But I've forgotten why
It's so important to me
I can't remember why

Seems like I'm fucked forever
Feels like at least for now
I forgot why
I need to feel these things
