as slow as rapid city
we must be gathering speed
here for something
trained for these tracks
but afraid of the frieght
and it doesn't get played on the radio

travel
wires and worries unravel
faced with unlacing the drinks
trade taps for tanks
a new ram in the ranks
our friends say way to go and where to go

never if you're out there
come along and save us from ourselves
oh how we missed it everything's twisted around

when the clouds come clear
open your eyes and we'll be here
never will come for us
everything's sung
never will comfort us
everything's wrong
never will come for us
never will come come
why won't you come?

never if you're out there
come to here and toast our merry year.
