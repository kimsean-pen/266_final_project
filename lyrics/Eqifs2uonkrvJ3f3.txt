Everything I want, I have
Money, notoriety, and rivieras
I even think I found God
In the flashbulbs of the pretty cameras
Pretty cameras, pretty cameras
Am I glamorous? Tell me, am I glamorous?

Hello? Hello?
C-can you hear me?
I can be your China doll, if you wanna see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful
They all think I have it all

I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you

Summertime is nice and hot
And my life is sweet like vanilla is
Gold and silver-lined my heart
But burned into my brain are these stolen images
Stolen images, baby, stolen images
Can you picture it? Babe, that life we could've lived

Hello? Hello?
C-can you hear me?
I can be your China doll, if you like to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful
They all think I have it all

I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you

We were two kids just tryin' to get out
Lived on the dark side of the American dream
We would dance all night, play our music loud
But when we grew up, nothing was what it seemed

Hello? Hello?
C-can you hear me?
I can be your China doll, if you like to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful
They think that I have it all

I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you

Hello? Hello?
C-can you hear me?
I can be your China doll, if you like to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful
They think that I have it all

I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you

All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing, if I can't have you
