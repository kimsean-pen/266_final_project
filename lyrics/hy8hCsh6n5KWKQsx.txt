I belong here where the world ends
I belong here where all hope ends
I belong here with 'The Waiting'
With the haunted, with the never seen
I belong here with 'The Faithless'
We are no-one, we are nothing at all

I will be here when the storm ends
I will sleep here when my time ends
I will cry here when the dead sing
'Will you save me, will you save me?'
On my knees I'll pray to something
But I don't know you, I don't know you at all

Can you see me when the wind blows through my soul?
Can you hear me when the scream is all I know?
Can you see me? This is all that I deserve
Can you hear me? I pray for the pain I'm serving

I belong here where the shame ends
I belong here where all life ends
I belong here with the fallen
Here is nowhere, here is everything
I belong here with the broken
We are lost and we have nothing to lose

Can you see me when the wind blows through my soul
Can you hear me when the scream is all I know
Can you see me? This is all that I deserve
Can you hear me? I pray for the pain I'm serving
