You stand now, on yourself
A little moon is coming in the room.
You stand there still
Like you were in the arms of everyone you ever wanted.

I was watching you well.

I won't stop you; I won't speak.
The water on your cheek is the only thing smooth and
I'm ashamed that I'm ashamed of you
Standing in my room, lest more water overtake you

And I was watching you, watching you well.

Why won't you leave me quicker
Why won't you leave me?

I'm ashamed that I'm ashamed of you
For standing in my room, lest more water overtake you

I won't stop you
And I won't speak.

Why won't you leave me quicker?

Why won't you leave me...
