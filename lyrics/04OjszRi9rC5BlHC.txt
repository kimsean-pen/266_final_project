I want you to know
When I look in your eyes
With every blow
Comes another lie

You think it's alright
You think it's alright
You think it's alright
You think it's alright

Can't you feel the knife, oh?
Can't you feel the knife, oh?
Can't you feel the knife, oh?
Can't you feel the knife, oh?

Knife
Knife
Knife
