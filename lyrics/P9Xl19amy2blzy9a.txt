I see you walking home alone, your face is alive and bright
But you can't see how weak you are 'cause I could end it tonight
It's the feeling you get when you think that someone behind is watching you
Well I can tell you now that someone is me and I'm about to make it right

Why do you take it all?
Why do I beg for more?
I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floor
Why do you take it all?

Why do I beg for more?
I never thought that this is how I'd HIT THE FLOOR!
I creep up from behind, touch your neck, move down your spine
You take a look and breathe so sharp

Just a matter of time
Don't scream I ask of you, but then you let one out and now it's time to go
I come down on you like a ton of brick
All over so it's time to go

Why do you take it all?
Why do I beg for more?
I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floor
Why do you take it all?

Why do I beg for more?
I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floor
HIT THE FLOOR!
Whoa-oah!

Whoa-oah!
Whoa-oah!
Whoa-oah!
Why do you take it all?
Why do I beg for more?
I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floor
Why do you take it all?
Why do I beg for more?
I never thought that this is how I'd HIT THE FLOOR!
Take this from me, I don't wanna hurt you
Take this from me, I don't WANNA HURT YOU!
