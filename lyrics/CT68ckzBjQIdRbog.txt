You were wrong when you said
everything's gunna be alright
Yeah you were wrong when you said
everything's gunna be alright

You were right when you said
all that glitters isn't gold
You were right when you said
all we are is dust in the wind
You were right when you said
we are all just bricks in the wall
and when you said
manic depression's a frustrating mess

You were wrong when you said
everything's gunna be alright
Yeah you were wrong when you said
everything's gunna be alright
You were wrong when you said
everything's gunna be alright

You were right when you said
you can't always get what you want
You were right when you said
it's a hard rain's gunna fall
You were right when you said
we're still running against the wind
Life goes on long after the thrill of living is gone
You were right when you said
this is the end

Do you have to think about it?
Do you have to think about it?
Do you have to think about it?
Do you have to think about it?
