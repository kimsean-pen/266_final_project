all the programs are filters
and the natives are repeating its words
grow some moss on my floor
and unlock that door
with love love love love love

and i hope that you understand
while walking in the quick sand
and i hope that you live again
while hanging in the trees embrace
and i hope that you figure it out
while hearing the fauna sound

hold me
hold me while you can

you're so pretty you're so pretty
anything at all
