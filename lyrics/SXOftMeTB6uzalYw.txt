We don't wanna
We don't wanna
We don't wanna neva end
We don't wanna
We don't wanna neva end
We don't wanna
We don't wanna neva end
We don't wanna neva

We don't wanna neva end
It's like our life it just began
You walkin' out, you comin' back again
Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I done took your heart, girl and hold it up for ransom
We don't wanna neva end
We don't wanna
We don't wanna neva end
We don't wanna

I could tell you was into me from my instant chemistry
Ask I reflect memory, you ride or you die for me
I go to war over you want but fuck will by showing you
You know what it is shawty, forever my lil shawty
Long As I'm swimmin' in Benjamins, you shop with no limited
You reminisce every session, know you'll come back again
I know you can't breath without me, you gon' need the oxygen
I don't know yet if you know but the hope is my medicine
I took a sip of your tea and I ain't been right ever since
As I think to myself what'd it be if I have a sin
Let's put the past behind us
And go far away where nobody can find us

We don't wanna neva end
It's like our life it just began
You walkin' out, you comin' back again
Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I done took your heart, girl and hold it up for ransom
We don't wanna neva end
We don't wanna
We don't wanna neva end
We don't wanna

You could eat a thing I bet you'll come to bay tomorrow
I could see the hate is comin' from a mile up
And it's all preparin' us for what we got comin'
If I did come your way and you feel like runnin'
Run in my direction and don't you run from me
Cause in the time we get together, we goin' stuntin'
And I'm applyin' major pressure, feel it in your stomach
It's lightnin', it's thunderin', you describe, left me wonderin'
Butterfly, butterfly
Will you gon ever leave?
Any time you leave outside
I know you comin' back
I know you comin' back to me

We don't wanna neva end
It's like our life it just began
You walkin' out, you comin' back again
Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I done took your heart, girl and hold it up for ransom
We don't wanna neva end
We don't wanna
We don't wanna neva end
We don't wanna

Is there anything you wanna know?
Is there any place you rather be?
You walk until your figure's off
I let you walk today
And I let you walk away to me
Actually that's a guarantee
Our friendship was guaranteed
You got my ego in another nee
I ain't tryna be cocky
I got your heart in my pocket

We don't wanna neva end
It's like our life it just began
You walkin' out, you comin' back again
Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I done took your heart, girl and hold it up for ransom
We don't wanna neva end
We don't wanna
We don't wanna neva end
We don't wanna
