I've been running alone in slow motion
You're waiting back home but you're breathless.
And I've been looking for someone to love,
While you were looking for someone you loved.

We tossed and we turned our oceans
You're walking back home and you're breathless.
'Cause you were looking for someone to be someone you lost,
And I just wanted to hold you,
To hold you when you were lost.

But you hit me like a tidal wave
I could hardly run and I couldn't escape
I get the feeling that you're far away but I could feel the earthquake
'Cause when you shake, I shake, we shake we shake.
When you shake, I shake, we shake we shake.
Try not to wonder if we're making mistakes
Or I'll be broken when the wave breaks.

I love how you're afraid of talking too much
But I'm just afraid of not saying enough
I try to keep quiet when I'm thinking too much
Just let you sedate me
But isn't this crazy?
Look we just went from strangers to friends
Look how long it's been
Now friends to lovers and we're under covers
Can't seem to stop letting this great wall of water
Wash over my own better judgement.

But you hit me like a tidal wave
I could hardly run and I couldn't escape
I get the feeling that you're far away but I could feel the earthquake
'Cause when you shake, I shake, we shake we shake.
When you shake, I shake, we shake we shake.
Try not to wonder if we're making mistakes
Or I'll be broken when the wave breaks.

It's always the same when I catch your crystal tears
You storm my gates when no one's guarding.

But you hit me like a tidal wave
I could hardly run and I couldn't escape
I get the feeling that you're far away but I could feel the earthquake
'Cause when you shake, I shake, we shake we shake.
When you shake, I shake, we shake we shake.
Try not to wonder if we're making mistakes
Or I'll be broken when the wave breaks.
