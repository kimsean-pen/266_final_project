I should have turned and walked away
But I got tangled in your chains
A trail of debt for all to see
You shut the cage and stole the key

Your state of mind revealed
That my love for you was real
They say in time wounds heal
But I've got nothing left to steal

My mouth is shut, my lips are sealed
You are the crutch of this disease
And I've been locked in your machine
Sit here and rot or break this deal

I spilled my blood on the checkered floor
You got me crawling back for more
You said the drag will take the bait
The bed of nails I can't escape

Your state of mind revealed
That my love for you was real
They say in time wounds heal
But I've got nothing left to steal

My mouth is shut, my lips are sealed
You are the crutch of this disease
And I've been locked in your machine
Sit here and rot or break this deal

Now it's so dark that I can see
The mental scars you left on me
So dig your nails and grind your teeth
I'm in your crutch for eternity

My mouth is shut, my lips are sealed
You are the crutch of this disease
And I've been locked in your machine
Sit here and rot or break this deal
