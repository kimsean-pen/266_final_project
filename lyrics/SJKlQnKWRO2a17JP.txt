God is dead
And Heaven is all locked up
Hope is lost to you and I

Deep inside
Digging through our landslide
Searchin' for the halo you tossed aside

You and I
We're Glass Animals, Glass Animals
Shattered to survive

Now I know
I would break myself wide open for you
My sacrifice reflected in your eyes

Hell is here
Tearing our insides out
Catching all the angels as they fall

You and I
We're Glass Animals, Glass Animals
Shattered to survive

Now I know
I would break myself wide open for you
My sacrifice reflected in your eyes

You don't know how this feels
You don't know how I feel

I don't trust what I see
Even salt looks like sugar
Every word binds like gravity
A crack in the Earth will release me

All I want is you and all I see is

You and I
We're Glass Animals, Glass Animals
Shattered to survive

You and I
We're Glass Animals, Glass Animals
Shatter to survive

Now I know
I would break myself wide open for you
My sacrifice reflected in you eyes
