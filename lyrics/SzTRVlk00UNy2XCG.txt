I'm starting to wonder
About my luck when it'll run out
Sooner or later
I'll be hit by a bus any day now
Are your eyes blocked by cataracts
You can't see how good you have it
You're taking a smile for granted

You're gonna wake up twenty years from now
Wishing you gave two shits about
All the lost moments you can never get back
You'd trade it for anything

Look back twenty years from now
Wondering why you cared about
Getting all the last words
Just to hear your own voice
But you weren't saying anything

When all goes your way
Your thoughts dissolve to nothing
We learn to walk from falling
So I'll kiss the curb

You're gonna wake up twenty years from now
Wishing you gave two shits about
All the lost moments you can never get back
You'd trade it for anything

Look back twenty years from now
Wondering why you cared about
Getting all the last words
Just to hear your own voice
But you weren't saying anything

No longer I worry about a future I can't figure out
This days sufficient enough for me
You're gonna wake up twenty years from now
Wishing you gave two shits about
All the lost moments you can never get back
You'd trade it for anything

Look back twenty years from now
Wondering why you cared about
Getting all the last words
Just to hear your own voice
But you weren't saying anything
Never get back, you'd trade it for anything

Trade it for anything
Trade it for anything
