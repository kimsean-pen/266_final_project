Tattoo, so vivid
Sunlight, oh, I's living
In time, I can get over
What happened, oh, last summer

Don't need you
Oh yes, I'm fine, too
No, I don't need you
Yes, I'm fine, too

I feel summer caving in
I just can't hold it back in
Up on the rooftop balcony
I came to just relax and
Pass time [?]
I thought id never see her
Another year under my belt
This time, and I don't need-

Remember what you're saying
You're giving, I'm just taking
I know, youre out in town, fishing
One bit, yet I'm living, yeah

Need you
Oh, yes, I'm fine, too
No, I don't need you
And still I'm fighting
