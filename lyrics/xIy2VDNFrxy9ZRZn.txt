Nobody told me
That being happy faces, trying to erase the traces
Of what came before me
The girl that I used to see is somewhere very deep

She's fallen asleep and I'm trying to wake her
Set her free

Now is a never ending thing
One moment turns into another
Before I've had time to run from all the other ones

And it's so hard to live her dreams
When the everything that they want you to be
Is anything but me

So much confusion
Circling outside my head, what this one and that one said
It's all an allusion
'Cause I'm still the same person no matter how fast I run

I'm trying to hold onto where it is I come from

Now is a never ending thing
And one moment turns into another
Before I've had time to run from all the other ones

And it's so hard to live her dreams
When the everything that they want you to be
Is anything but me
Not anything but me

I'm trying to hold onto where it is I come from

Now is a never ending thing
And one moment turns into another
Before I've had time to run from all the other ones

And it's so hard to live her dreams
When the everything that they want you to be
Is anything but me
