Hanging by the bar at sunrise
With our bodies talking
Hooked up last week, had a good time
So I regret nothing

I see her come close, ooh
I wonder what you told her to make her stay

She don't know what you did when you come back home
She don't know what you doin' now, all night long
She don't know all the photos you've (got) in your phone
But she know (she know, she know)
She'd rather smile and pretend with ya than let go
She don't know what you're doin' now, all night long
She don't know all the photos you've (got) in your phone
But she know (she know, she know)

Blaming me for all the sadness
Didn't know 'bout you two
Don't see why I'm dragged into it
This whole thing is on you

I see her heart break, ooh
Still she's keeping face
Leave it to me, 'cause, babe

She don't know what you did when you come back home
She don't know what you doin' now, all night long
She don't know all the photos you've (got) in your phone
But she know (she know, she know)
She'd rather smile and pretend with ya than let go
She don't know what you're doin' now, all night long
She don't know all the photos you've (got) in your phone
But she know (she know, she know)

Don't even bother with your lies
Won't let you see her when she cries
Go on, unhappy in the night

She don't know what you did when you come back home
She don't know what you doin' now, all night long
She don't know all the photos you've (got) in your phone
But she know (she know, she know)
She'd rather smile and pretend with ya than let go
She don't know what you're doin' now, all night long
She don't know all the photos you've (got) in your phone
But she know (she know, she know)
