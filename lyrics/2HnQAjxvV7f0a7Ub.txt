Babe you've been feeling poorly
I've been dealing with stress
Why don't we go out tonight?
Put on your favorite dress
Let's drive
Into the night, into the light
Let's ride
Put on an old blues song
Let all our troubles be gone
Let's drive
Feel like I've been a prisoner
Of my own desire
I've been such a bad listener
But I hear you tonight
Let's drive
Into the night, into the light
Let's ride
Put on some old blues songs
Let all our troubles be gone
Let's Drive
Let's Drive

30 miles from Santa Fe
Bound for San Anton
Even though it's dark out here
I don't feel alone
Let's drive
Into the night, into the light
Let's ride
Put on an old blues song
Let all our troubles be gone
Let's Drive
Put on an old blues song
Let all our troubles be gone
Let's Drive
Let's Drive
