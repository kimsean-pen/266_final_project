You should get some of your own
Count that money, get your game on

Get your game on, get ya, get ya, game on

You can't stop looking me, staring at me, be what I be
You can't stop looking at me
So get off of my face
You can't stop clickin' 'bout me
Writin' 'bout me, tweeting 'bout me

I can't stop, it's what I gon' be
My swagger's in check
Get on the floor
Get, get, get on the floor

My swagger's in check
Get on the floor
Get, get, get on the floor
I-I-I got in check

You're a hater, just let it go

You should get some of your own

Count that money, get your game on
Get your game on, get your game on
You, you can't stop shoutin' at me
Holler at me, be what I be

You can't stop looking at, so get off of my way
You, you can't stop youtubing me
On repeat, running this beat
You can't stop, this one is on me

I'm laughing all the way
Get on the floor
Get, get, get on the floor

Get, get, get on the floor
Get, get, get on the floor
I-I-I got in check

Get, get on the floor

Get on the floor (you can't stop)
Get on the floor
I got it in check
