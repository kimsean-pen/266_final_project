Move
Down the road I go

Move
Down the road I go

There's mud in the water
Roach in the cellar
Bugs in the sugar
Mortgage on the home
Mortgage on the home

There's garbage on the sidewalk
Highways in the backyard
Police on the corner
Mortgage on the car
Mortgage on the car

Move
Down the road I go

They're sellin' independence
Actors in the White House
Acid indigestion
Mortgage on my life
Mortgage on my life

Move
Down the road I go

Ramble tamble
Ramble tamble
Ramble tamble
