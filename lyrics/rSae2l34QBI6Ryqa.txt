Oh, oh, oh, oh
She's my favorite girl
Don't you know
Oh, oh, oh, oh
She's my favorite girl

You walked into my life
Your love was so new
And nothing will ever change
My feelings for you
Well You were so far away
Now I am close to you, girl
So let us run away
In our heart that's where you will stay

Oh, oh, oh, oh
She's my favorite girl
Don't you know
Oh, oh, oh, oh
She's my favorite girl

There's so much I like in you
I can't go wrong
I wanted a girl like you
I've looked so long

Girl, nothing will make us stop
I know our love is too strong
Let's leave the rest behind
Our dreams ask what we will find

Oh, oh, oh, oh
She's my favorite girl
Don't you know
Oh, oh, oh, oh
She's my favorite girl

Oh, oh, oh, oh
She's my favorite girl
Don't you know
Oh, oh, oh, oh
She's my favorite girl

She's my favorite girl
The one I'm always thinking of, (that's word)
The one I love

Oh, oh, oh, oh
She's my favorite girl
Don't you know
Oh, oh, oh, oh
She's my favorite girl

She is my favorite girl
You look so sweet
You make my heart skip a beat
Yeah, yeah, yeah she's my favorite girl
She's my girl
She is my favorite girl

Hey girl
Don't you
You're the one I need
And girl, I need, I need, I need, I need
Your love

Oh, oh, oh, oh
She's my favorite girl
Don't you know
Oh, oh, oh, oh
She's my favorite girl

Oh oh oh oh
She's my favorite girl
Don't you know
Oh, oh, oh, oh
She's my favorite girl
