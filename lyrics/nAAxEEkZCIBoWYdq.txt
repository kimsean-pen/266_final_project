They, they sleep in a coma, ya ya ya
They, they speak in a code I don't under under under understand
They shake with a limp hand, ooo ooo ooo
They, they don't shake like a rock band

Talking 'bout the business man, devil in a Sunday hat
Kind of old and kind of fat, just talking 'bout the business man

They, they sleepin' in a coma, deep, ya ya ya
They, they speakin' in a code I don't under under under understand
They spit on the po'man, ooo ooo ooo
They, they don't spit like a punk band

Talking 'bout the business man, devil in a Sunday hat
Buddy with the stupid laugh, just talking 'bout the business man

Pretty little baby, pretty little monster
Went to the good school, left with honors
Brand new tycoon, sitting with a harpoon
Something of a lampoon, out of a cartoon of a baboon
With a bond, a stock, a share in the moon

Talking 'bout the business man, devil with an evil plan
Buddy in the stupid pants, kind of old and kind of fat
Just talking 'bout the business man, the business man
