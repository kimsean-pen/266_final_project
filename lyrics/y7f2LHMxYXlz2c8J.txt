When you were mine
I gave you all of my money
Time after time
You've done me wrong
Just like a train
Let all my friends come over and eat
You were so strange
You didn't have the decency to change the sheets
Oh, when you were mine
Used to let you wear all o' my clothes
You were so fine
And baby that's the reason that it hurt me so
I know, that you're goin' with another guy
I don't care, 'cause I love you baby that's no lie
I love you more than I did when you were mine
When you were mine
You were kinda sorta my best friend
So I was blind
I let you fool around
I never cared
I never was the kind to make a fuss
When he was there
Sleepin' in between the two of us
I know, that you're goin' with another guy
I don't care, 'cause I love you baby that's no lie
I love you more than I did when you were mine
When you were mine
You were all I ever wanted to do
Now I spend my time
Followin' him whenever he's with you
I know that you're goin' with another guy
I don't care, 'cause I love you baby that's no lie
I love you more than I did when you were mine
Oh I love you more than I did when you were mine
Oh I love you more than I did when you were mine
Oh I love you more, I love you more when you were mine
Oh I love you, I love you more,
I love you more, I love you more, I love you more
I love you more when you were mine
