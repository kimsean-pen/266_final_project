He's pining for her
In a people carrier
There might be buildings & pretty things to see like that
But architecture won't do

Although it might say a lot about the city or town
I don't care what they've got, keep on turning 'em down
It don't say the funny things she does
Don't even try & cheer him up, because
It just won't happen

He's got the feeling again
This time on the aeroplane
There might be tellys in the back of the seats in front
But Rodney & Del won't do

Although it might take your mind off the aches & the pains
Laugh when he falls through the bar
But you're feeling the same
'Cause she isn't there to hold your hand
She won't be waiting for you when you land

It feels like she's just nowhere near
You could well be out on your ear
This thought comes closely followed by the fear
& the thought of it
Makes you feel a bit ill

Yesterday I saw a girl who looked like someone you might knock about with
& almost shouted
& then reality kicked in within us

It seems as we become the winners
You lose a bit of summat
& half wonder if you won it at all
& don't say 'owt 'cause you've got no idea

& she's still nowhere near
& the thought comes closely followed by the fear
& the thought of it
Makes you feel a bit ill
Despair in the departure lounge
Is one & they'll still be around at three
No signal & low battery
What's happened to me?
