When I look into your eyes I see
Everything I was meant to be
If I'm a fool for love
I don't care, I don't care

When we're together
All I know
There is no place
I need to go
If I'm a fool for love
I don't care, I don't care

CHORUS:
If I'm a fool for love
If I'm a fool for love
If I'm a fool for love
I don't care
I don't care

Visions of moonlight
In the park
We kissed and danced away
In the dark
If I'm a fool for love
I don't care, I don't care

Was it wrong to show you
All I feel?
No, I think that what
Does us in is the
Love we're afraid to reveal...

Driving midnight highway one
Love is the ocean
You're the one

If im a fool for love
I don't care I don't care

*Repeat chorus to fade
