Well I remember my first day of public school
I was very scared of getting pummeled
And sure enough i did at first recess
I got pegged in the head by a big red ball
And stumbled, my head hung
Back to class with a bloody nose
and soon it was lunch time
Mom said I should ask about how poor kids there get fed
So i got a book of tickets and a scedule and it read

(chorus)
Monday: hotdogs
Tuesday: Tacos
Wednesday: hamburgers and chocolate milk
Thursday: sloppy joes and burritos in a bag
Friday was pizza day, the best day of the week
All the kids would line up super early just to eat
Monday: hotdogs
Tuesday: Tacos
Wednesday: hamburgers and chocolate milk
Thursday: sloppy joes and burritos in a bag
Friday was pizza day, the best day of the week
It always came with salad and a side of pork and beans
Hooray for pizza day
Hooray for pizza day
I miss pizza day
The best day of the week

Well i remember my first day of Jr. High
I had hairspray in my hair and my pants were way too tight
And all the breakers and new-wavers and the rockers and the preps
Would all be in their places on the front lawn or the steps
I hung out with some punker kids who used to make me laugh
Got thrown in the dumpster by some rich kids near the caff

As time went on we figured out it was totally uncool
To eat the welfare lunch
Provided by the school
So in poser punker fashion we just mooched off all the kids
And lived off eating candy bars and bags of nacho chips

(chorus)

Well now I'm out of school and i don't have a job (you're a slob)
I just sit around all sweaty and lethargic
And i'm just thinkin' 'bout where it all went wrong
Why I can't concentrate on anything but reruns
I wish i had some more stability and I
I wish I had somebody makin' lunch for me
I guess I miss the simple things in life
The thought of pizza day
I thought it stupid then but I wish I had it now
I just want

(chorus)

Hooray for pizza day
Hooray for pizza day
I miss pizza day...

Best day of the week
Says Michael Jackson of Ensino California.
When he's not in his little theme parks,
He's eating pizza with the kids.
Whoa, moonwalker's back.
Hey, grab a slice buddy!
Take your glove off first,
You'llenjoy it more.
