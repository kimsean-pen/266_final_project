Somewhere only we know, somewhere only we know
Meet me at the cross street corner by the grove
Cooking up ideas like my brain is on a stove
Tryina keep it hush can you keep it on the low
I'm talking about the place only only we know
And running bird speed in my rear view mirr'
Leave it all behind take the wheel disappear
Clock side packed my song until you hear
About to say a far east better move it right here
We do it primo, we do it primo
We do it primo, just meet me at the top (somewhere only we know)
We do it primo, we do it primo
We do it primo, hear the secrets that I got (somewhere only we know)
Somewhere only we know
You can call me NASSA cause we about to blow
I'm talking about the place only only we know
Swerve my own way just ignore the dotted line
My face is like a page so you can read my mind
We don't need to talk when our bodies wanna mime
My heart is a 10 K racing beats double time
Forget about the map now I'm lost within your eyes
Tripped up feeling thanks now spilling out the beat time

We do it primo, we do it primo
We do it primo, just meet me at the top (somwhere only we know)
We do it primo, we do it primo
We do it primo, hear the secrets that I got (somewhere only we know)
I'ma gonna need another minute
You're about to be up in my bizness
Sweeter than vanilla you're delicious
Slaying all of this like it was Christmas
Wishing that forever was existent
At least we got to see this got to witness
Hanging by a thread I need a hero
So why don't we go, somewhere only we know
Somewhere only we know, somewhere only we know
Somewhere only we know, somewhere only we know
We do it primo, we do it primo
We do it primo, just meet me at the top (somewhere only we know)
We do it primo, we do it primo
We do it primo, hear the secrets that I got (somewhere only we know)
Somewhere only we know
Somewhere only we know
Somewhere only we know
Somewhere only we know
Somewhere only we know
