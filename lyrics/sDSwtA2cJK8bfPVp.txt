lost on path under the stars
watching the sky falling apart
into the night out in the cold
yours is the hand no one can hold

I could breath on the outside
you could break me on the inside
I could breath on the outside
I could stay on the outside

into the night out in the cold
yours is the hand no one can hold
lost on path under the stars
watching the sky falling apart

I could breath on the outside
you could break me on the inside
I could breath on the outside
I could stay on the outside

I could breath on the outside
I could stay on the outside
