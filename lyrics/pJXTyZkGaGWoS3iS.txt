Hello my love, I heard a kiss from you
Red magic satin playing near, too
All through the morning rain I gaze, the sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind

In the garden, I see
West purple shower bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins
Dressed in green

Pretty music I hear
So happy and loud
Blue flower echo
From a cherry cloud

Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh
If you try to ask
"Is it cool?"

If you arrive and don't see me
I'm going to be with my baby
I am free, flying in her arms
Over the sea

Stained window yellow candy screen
See speakers of kite
With velvet roses diggin'
Freedom flight

A present from you
Strawberry letter twenty-two
The music plays I sit
In for a few
