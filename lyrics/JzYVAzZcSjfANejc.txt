When he died
Turns out he left behind a mansion full of other people's skulls
The odd thing is, they never found his own, when he died
When he died
He somehow left behind strange symbols on the floor beneath his corpse
Investigators said the wood was scorched, when he died

When he died they found so many scorpions inside his lungs
When he died the statues of his missing children cried
What was later found to be his blood

When he died (On a dark and stormy night)
They telephoned his wife (Who reacted with delight)
But gradually her voice began to fade to nothing
And the Laughing Record played
The Laughing Record played

When he died
They found a message etched into his spine
That said when he died an endless age of untold nightmares would be nigh
And the blood would make the seas run red

When he died (On a dark and stormy night)
A nearby shed caught fire (It simply caught alight)
And when they cleared the charred wood from the ground
Inside they found a painting of a clown (A creepy painting of a clown)
He'd painted it when he was just a child
But scrawled upon the back was exactly when he died
When he died, when he died, when he died, when he died
