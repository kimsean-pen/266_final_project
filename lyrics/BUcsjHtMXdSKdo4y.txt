Baby, if I could find words to
Sing along with you would feel swoon
I'm so into the thought of a good mood
To disregard time and stay in tune
And then I'll get down with you
If the melody is stuck in our heads
We should find a spot to keep repeating
The singing from you is worth all the times
I've heard us sing
And then I'll get down with you
