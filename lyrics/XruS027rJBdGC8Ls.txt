Never, never lose sight
Of what you started it for
No matter what comes in between

And I used to think
That I knew better than those around me
But something changed along the way
And you're the reason I'm wanting to stay

I used to sink and now I swim
I've had to work for everything

When will you recognize your it, you're the reason I feel so alive
And none else comes in between

And I used to think
That I knew better than those around me
But something changed along the way
And you're the reason I'm wanting to stay
I can't turn my back and leave you
After all you've done for me
I can't turn my back and leave you
After all you've done for me

The blues have wrapped their arms
Around me and I can't make sense of it
The blues have wrapped their arms
Around me
I wish it was you instead
The blues have wrapped their arms
Around me and I can't make sense of it
The blues have wrapped their arms
Around me

Oh how I wish it was you instead

I never knew I could feel like this

The blues have wrapped their arms around me
Oh how I wish it was you instead
The blues have wrapped their arms around me
Oh how I wish it was you instead
The blues have wrapped their arms around me
Oh how I wish it was you instead
