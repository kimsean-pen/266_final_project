Oh Shit!
They Said "Man we want some more hits
Man this sound like some shit from '06
What that sound like man that's some cold shit, cold shit"
I said
Oh shit!
Aaaw, so you want some more hits?
This ain't sound like some shit from '06
Fuck what it sound like man that some cold shit, cold shit

I say this ain't jazz rap
This that this that spazz Rap
This that raised by the internet ain't had no dad rap
Yo I'm good don't pass that
Hit me on my Snapchat
You might have to back back
Cause your shit is mad whack
This that eeny meeny miney mo
Might need some snap cash
Matter fact
Hit the liquor store might need some cash back
Grab some gum and some water
Yeah them chips yeah grab that
Watch your son and your daughter
Cause them pigs will snatch that
Cause they always try to box us in but we won't have that
I'm a sleeper, Dennis Rodman, so watch the glass jack
Remember when I had a composition in the backpack
Now we killing with the composition like the Rat Pack
I say this ain't jazz rap
This that- this that spazz Rap
This that raised by the internet ain't had no dad rap
Yo I'm good don't pass that
Hit me on my Snapchat
You might have to back back
Cause your shit is mad whack, wassup

Oh Shit!

This the type shit I used to ride with Tegole in his Chevy to
'06, back when I supposed to graduate from school
Remember momma told me that I need to get my act together
10 years passed the only difference is I'm rapping better
Copped my own swishers
Shoulder-tapping for them bottles now
'less I'm with my big brother
Chuckie used to hold it down
Now that shit is popping
Fake homies want to come around
And they say I changed
They just mad cause I'm stunting now
Got you like "Oh Shit!"
And this the type of beat that make me drink a whole fifth
And this is how we doin'
Word to the old fifth
And you know everything we drop
That's some cold shit, cold shit, yeah
This ain't jazz rap
This that this that Dad rap
This that fuck my nine to five I'm leaving
Never coming back
I'm too good at rap, jack
To get caught in rat traps
If your shit is mad whack
Homie you can have that, have that

Oh Shit!
They Said "Man we want some more hits

On and on and on
Play my favorite song
Make me dance all night
Baby, you do it right
Woah
