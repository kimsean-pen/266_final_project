Stop touching me without permission
Don't disobey, answer to me
Said if you wanna play, follow direction
We do this my way, my way, my way
What do you really want? What do wanna know?
What do you wanna see? Where do you wanna go?
If you leave it to me, we will not go slow
I got places to be, when you're ready let me know
I'm just a little bossy
I like it how I like it, when I like it and that's how it is
I'm just a little bossy
You got a problem with it? If I want it I get it now
(L-la la la, l-la la la)
I get it now
(L-la la la)
I'm just a little bossy
(L-la la la, l-la la la)
I get it now
(L-la la la)
I'm just a little bossy
Trust me, you want me happy
Punishment can be severe
Please me and I will gladly
Brighten up your atmosphere
Let me shine for you, oh
Let me shine for you, oh, oh
Only if I want to
I'm just a little bossy
I like it how I like it, when I like it and that's how it is
I'm just a little bossy
You got a problem with it? If I want it I get it now
(L-la la la, l-la la la)
I get it now
(L-la la la)
I'm just a little bossy
(L-la la la, l-la la la)
I get it now
(L-la la la)
I'm just a little bossy
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Don't tell me no
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Don't tell me no
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh!
I'm just a little bossy
I like it how I like it, when I like it and that's how it is
I'm just a little bossy
You got a problem with it? If I want it I get it now
(L-la la la, l-la la la)
I get it now
(L-la la la)
I'm just a little bossy
(L-la la la, l-la la la)
I get it now
(L-la la la)
I'm just a little bossy
I'm just a little bossy
I'm just a little bossy
