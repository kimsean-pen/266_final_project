Have I not been crude
Or do I sound insincere
I'm just trying to make some sense of this
Before I lose another year
Its all that I can do
'Cause its so hard to feel
They control you
Like I'm behind the wheel
But it won't steer
Stepping off the stone
Do I want to, no I don't
It was clear in what the path I left behind
And now I feel alone
No matter what I do
'Cause its so hard to feel
They control you
Like I'm behind the wheel
But it won't steer
Have I not been crude
Or do I sound insincere
I'm just trying to make some sense of this
Before I lose another year
