These are your good years, don't take my advice
You never wanted the nice boys anyway
And I'm of good cheer 'cause I've been checking my list
The gifts you're receiving from me will be
One awkward silence and two hopes
You cry yourself to sleep, staying up, waiting by the phone
All I want this year is for you to dedicate
Your last breathe to me before you bury yourself alive
Don't come home for Christmas
You're the last thing I wanna see
Underneath the tree
Merry Christmas, I could care less
Happy New Years, baby, you owe me
The best gift I will ever ask for
Don't call me up when the snow comes down
It's the only thing I want this year
One awkward silence and two hopes
You cry yourself to sleep, staying up, waiting by the phone
And all I want this year is for you to dedicate
Your last breathe to me before you bury yourself alive
Don't come home for Christmas
You're the last thing I wanna see
Underneath the tree
Merry Christmas, I could care less
Don't come home for Christmas
You're the last thing I wanna see
Underneath the tree
(Don't come home for Christmas)
Merry Christmas, I could care less
Don't come home for Christmas
You're the last thing I wanna see
Underneath the tree
(Don't come home for Christmas)
Merry Christmas, I could care less
