I wanna live life with heavy '11 vibes
We didn't have approval before label signs
Multiple times
I can't wait for the complaints
About cut vocals and pop
'Cause y'all are stuck in the past
And I've got a crystal ball

"Nobody wants to hear you cry about your breakup, so drop it."
Well, that's fine too because I'm fucking sick of talking about it
Let's talk about shows and ghosts and shows and clothes
designs and shows and shows.(okay I think you might be right)

See, I'm like you without good moods and
My cave's my room where I'll cave too
Yeah, I'm like you without good moods
And you'll be sorry when you come to

Lose your mind

I treat walking the plank
Like I'm jumping off a diving board
Listening to The Latest Plague
I breathe nostalgia until I'm bored
I can't just give a love song
Without a bitter aftertaste
I'm afraid to dive headfirst
And crack my brain out of it's cage

It's harder than it should be
For me to be straightforward
Like even when I did
I couldn't tell her I adored her
Which I know is messed up
And I know I messed up
But at least I 'fessed up
Now of course it's too late

See, I'm like you without good moods and
My cave's my room where I'll cave too
Yeah, I'm like you without good moods
And you'll be sorry when you come to

Lose your mind

I could live on a life raft next to you
I would swim if it keeps me close to you
If you fall I'll swim right back to you
I could live on a life raft next to you

I've been building this island every day
Waiting for the right time to get away
Every day, I'm more numb to the Sad Game
So I'll just live on this island until I break

See, I'm like you without good moods and
My cave's my room where I'll cave too
Yeah, I'm like you without good moods
And you'll be sorry when you come to

Lose your mind

I could live on a life raft next to you
I would swim if it keeps me close to you
If you fall I'll swim right back to you
I could live on a life raft next to you

I've been building this island every day
Waiting for the right time to get away
Every day, I'm more numb to the Sad Game
So I'll just live on this island until I break
