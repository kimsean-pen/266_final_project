Push it out, fake a smile
Avert disaster, just in time
I need a drink, 'cause in a while
Worthless answers from friends of mine
It's dumb to ask, cool to ignore
Girls possess me but they're never mine
I made my entrance, avoided hazards
Checked my engine, I fell behind
Tala, tala, tala, talata
I fell behind
Tala, tala, tala, talata

She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storm's gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on, days like this, like the prom
I get too scared to move, 'cause I'm a fuckin' boy

Remember when I was in the grocery store
Now's my time
Lost the words, lost a nerve
Lost the girl, left the line
I would wish upon a star
But that star, it doesn't shine
So read my book with a boring ending
A short story of a lonely guy
Tala, tala, tala, talata
Who fell behind
Tala, tala, tala, talata

She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storm's gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on, days like this, like the prom
I get too scared to move, 'cause I'm a fuckin' boy

Tala, tala, tala, talata
Tala, tala, tala, talata
She makes me feel like it's raining outside (Tala, tala, tala, talata...)
And when the storm's gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on, days like this like the prom
I get too scared to move, 'cause I'm still just a stupid, worthless boy
