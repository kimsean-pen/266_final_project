Big deal maker
Orange entertainer
Swamp it up gator
Gang of undertakers
Make the new news faker
Swear me in, hater

Here is the strategy
We begin with comedy
Make 'em feel, make 'em feel real
Sing that simple melody

We'll be the remedy
The Cold golden family
Make 'em feel, make 'em feel real
Fuck up the facts, fuck up the facts

Follow the tweeter
The Breitbart news leader
The great white preacher
Third world leecher
Grab the gut feature
Shot your teacher

Long live the enemy
Kitty kitty, the fantasy
Make a deal, make 'em feel real
Kitty cat catch of reality

We'll be the remedy

The Cold golden family
Make 'em feel, make 'em feel real
Fuck up the facts, fuck up the facts

I rub the lamp easy
The people's choice genie
I get on top, see me

I got me stone easy
I got the people needy
Just swear me in, feed me

Long Live the enemy
Kitty Kitty, the fantasy
Make 'em feel, make 'em feel real
Sing that simple melody

I am the remedy
I am reality
Eat it up, eat it all up.
