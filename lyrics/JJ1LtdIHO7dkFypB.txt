Hey boy
I don't need to know where you've been
All I need to know is you and no need for talking
Hey boy
So don't even tell me your name
All I need to Know is whose place and let's get walkin'

All I wanna do is love your body
Oh oh oh oh...
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want me
Oh oh oh oh...

All I wanna do is love your body
All I wanna do is love your body
All I wanna do is love your body
All I wanna do is love your body

Oh oh yeah...
(Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want me)
Oh oh oh oh oh...
I think you already know my name
I think you already know my name
(Heeey, All right, Say, All right, Say)
I think you already know my name
(N-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ame)
Oh oh Yeah...
Oh oh oh oh oh...
