I saw your face in the crowd
Everyone dancing
I asked if they knew your name
They couldn't see you
Thought I'd walk over
Stood there right next to you
Got a sensation
You were right for my body

Ha-ha-ha-ha
You're heaven
Ha-ha-ha-ha
We radiate
Ha-ha-ha-ha
You're heaven
Ha-ha-ha-ha
We radiate

I felt a chill in the air
It's not me dancing
Everyone looks kinda strange
Colors colliding
I'm in possession
This is no ordinary
Friday night disco
You stepped into my body

Ha-ha-ha-ha
You're heaven
Ha-ha-ha-ha
We radiate
Ha-ha-ha-ha
You're heaven
Ha-ha-ha-ha
We radiate
