She left me hangin' by a thread again
I stood there waiting like a fool for her
I never dreamed that I'd be in this place
But here I am all alone, Mmm

It's not the first time that she's walked away
And changed all our plans within the blink of an eye
And looking back it's always been the same
But I refused to see it all for what it was

Has anybody ever felt this way, has anybody been ripped apart?
Anybody gave everything to the one they love?
Am I the only one left behind, am I the only one who hates goodbyes?
God, I know this can't go on forever

I wonder if she ever thinks of me
And all the promises she swore to keep
Some nights I lay in bed just burning up
'Cause I know that she's out with someone else, now

Has anybody ever felt this way, has anybody been ripped apart?
Anybody gave everything to the one they love?
Am I the only one left behind, am I the only one who hates goodbyes?
God, I know this can't go on forever

I was the one who gave up everything for her
When no one would listen I heard every word
It took me so long to see that maybe I am better off alone, yeah

Has anybody ever felt this way, has anybody been ripped apart?
Anybody gave everything to the one they love?
Am I the only one left behind, am I the only one who hates goodbyes?
God, I know this can't go on forever

Has anybody ever felt this way, has anybody been ripped apart?
Anybody gave everything to the one they love?
Am I the only one left behind, am I the only one who hates goodbyes?
God, I know this can't go on, all I wanna do is just move on
God, I know this can't go on forever
Yeah, I know this won't go on forever, yeah
God, I know this can't go on forever
