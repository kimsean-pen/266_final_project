An even strobe
A pulse of flashing hate
Lights of synthetic souls massproduced
Hammered to shape a sign of times dreams
Turn into systems a new way a new breed
Implanted in our minds

Here I am in the hand of a sterile hate
The new control
I can not wake
I'm not a sleep

New intelligence arise in emptied bodies
Turgid flesh tested through eternal spastic
Fits through not known codes mother
Machine in genocide now scorn a dying race

Evolution in reverse now it's time for me
Changing what am I to be contorted
An eternity defeated

Programmed to appease you
We're symbols of perfection
Humanoids ruined by your laws:
Destroy, erase, improve, lesson first:
Submission, we're docile servant dogs
Our leashes are your limbs
Computed deep within

Remoted minds controlled our thoughts
No more doubts
The new way is here disgorged

Another thousands fakes that obey to a circuit skein
To vacuum mechanical thoughts
I now conceive, no longer me
Always to see inanity
Millions to be units like me
Eternally human patterns
Copied, dissected, distorted
Completed to fit the machine
The nerve fibres give in to cords to the unknown

See me, be me, same contents, same machine
The currency of ours
No more flesh and bone
We are too unaware of what we have been before
Evolution in reverse
Now it's time for me
Changing what am I to be contorted
An eternity defeated by the new machine
