Listen closely, to what i'm about to say.
I think i've heard just about enough of your hypocritical ways.
Don't try to stop me now
Don't you make a sound
You've built yourself up oh so high just to tear me down
Im so tired of you telling me
how to live and who i should not be
And I'm so tired of you telling me
What to do and what I don't believe
And after all that your telling me
Why is there hate that only you can see
And im so sick of you telling me that i will burn
That i will not be free
This is my song
My red crusade
What will i say?
What will i do?
Maybe its fear that leads your rage
Maybe you're me and i am you
So go ahead and point your finger
Tell me who to love is it him or her?
When will you see there's other way out?

I'm not gonna change
So stay out of my way
I don't need you to understand
That I'm already saved
Maybe you should stop pushing all your greed
Can you look me in my eyes and say we're not the same.
Did you really think by pushing me
I would become what you want me to be?
And did you really think by hurting me
I'd open up and just hand you the key?
I know you're scared and don't understand
This is my life, this is who I am
What I do know is come Judgement Day
There's not a lot you can still the same
This is my song
My red crusade
What will i say?
What will i do?
Maybe its fear that leads your rage
Maybe you're me and i am you
So go ahead and point your finger
Tell me who to love is it him or her?
When will you see there's other way out?
