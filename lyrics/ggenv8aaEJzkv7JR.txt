Time without time and I'll see that I'm writing a x4
Nothing takes, nothing holds
Nothing holds, nothing takes
Nothing holds, nothing takes
Nothing holds over your line
Go without gold and I'll wait till I'm old I said x4
Nothing holds, nothing takes
Nothing takes, nothing holds

Nothing takes, nothing holds
Nothings holds over your line

Entire families are waiting in line
It's a little bit strange
Yeah, a little bit strange
I'm looking for something to cover my scars

It's a little bit strange
Yeah, a little bit strange
Yeah, a lot of bit strange

Well that's all right
Better get your things in line
Step on the??
Didn't get enough
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Didn't get enough
Jubilation?
Concentration?
Combination?
Well that's all right
Better get your things in line?
