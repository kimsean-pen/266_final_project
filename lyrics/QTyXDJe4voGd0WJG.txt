I can't read your mind
Thinking my heart is starting to turn us blind (turn us blind)
Do you still fantasize
Or has our time just come and passed us by
I wanna know how you feel about this love
I wanna know
I wanna know how you feel about this love
I wanna know

(I wanna know)
(I wanna know)

Can't let this go
I want your love, please let it show
I wanna know how you feel about this love
I wanna know how you feel about this love
I wanna know
I wanna know how you feel about this love
I wanna know

(I wanna know)
(I wanna know)
(I wanna know how you feel about this love)
(I wanna know how you feel about this love)
