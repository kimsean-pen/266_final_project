I Wake up every morning and do what the fuck I want
And I don't deal with nobody til I smoke my blunt
I take his last meal if he assuming I'm a punk
You get yo ass caught inside my cage then we done
These niggas talking shit with no metals on they arms
But bitch I'm laid out whole suit made of armor
Captain Mobile Suit let blood wings fly out my armor
Let me catch him slipping I'ma drag him to his momma
I can't ever fall boy I run the whole tundra
You bring a fool to me I'll breathe some ice in his stomach
Now he can't bare the pain you see blood when he vomit
I told this boy ahead of time that he ain't even want it
Now i be smoking blunts that make me think I'm in Dubai
And I'm still moving forward with my fleet on the right
My whole squad healthy looking up to the sky
And we gon sail forever we won't ever lose a fight
Nowadays labels hit us up and we know why
Cuz we killing all them signed artists on sight
And bitch we gon decline til the situation right
I let Hollow Squad the Coffin Fleet sink a nigga life
Bitch
