You remember how we met
Silhouetted by the lights
You were drunk and tried to take
A mental picture with your hands

I was thinking about that
And a bunch of other things
Stop looking at the floor
I need to pour out this expansive dose of words

I can't explain
I need to be alone

I know the timing isn't great
But these things you just can't plan
I just need a little time
So I can find myself again

'Cause I get buried underneath
All the things they think you are
And I'm too tired to pretend
It doesn't hurt to be left out

I had a pocket full of dreams
But I gave them all to you
Now I think I want 'em back
So can you tell me if I'm crazy or confused?

Don't ever change
The way you are
I've never loved anyone more
