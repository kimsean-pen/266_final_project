First time Kelly kissed a boy
Glow in the dark arrow in the heart
First time Kelly kissed a boy
Economy broke down
We work on a lost hour

First time Kelly kissed a boy
Glow in the dark arrow in the heart
First time Kelly kissed a boy was an
Echo in smiles and a virgin blue love letter

At a dead end
That's why I'm out minding my own
All the colors in may
Found it boring and left
(Need a new order)
No, no better
Feel rush far beyond
All that happiness feels
Like spring of our loneliness

First time Kelly kissed a boy
Tinted dreams and ambulance
First time Kelly kissed a boy
Talk hit a dead end
Crucifix crossed it

At a dead end
That's why I'm out minding my own
All the colors in may
Found it boring and left
(Need a new order)
No, no better
Feel rush far beyond
All that happiness feels
Like spring of our loneliness
