They call me a little wound-up
See, I'm upset because I've always been stuck
But I don't know what it is I'm without
Guess I'm in love with always feeling down
It was fully consumed
By all of the petty things that I couldn't do
All of the plastic all are surely worn
But I didn't ever show, I let it go
So I listen while I'm told

Sit back, don't think
Get high, take drink
Sit back, don't think
The more I listen, the deeper I sink and

Ooh, I go higher
And I say, ooh, a-ooh, I go higher
This head that I hold, oh, it's so tired
And I say, oh, no, I go higher
And I say, ooh,
What's it gon', what's it gonna be
Make me say, ooh,
What's it gon', what's it gonna be
I'm feelin' so cold,
What they want, what they want from me
Make me say ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (they want, they gonna be)

So find me stuck in the scene
I wanna get out but there's no in-between
So I sit back as I watch the crowd go
Never assuming that I've sunken so low
If I wanna be free
I gotta stop playin' round and runnin' from me
'Cause all of the plastic all are surely worn
They got my head feelin' low, no one to throw
So I listen while I'm told

Sit back, don't think
Get high, take drink
Don't feel, just go
If you listen carefully, then you won't feel so low

Sit back, don't think
The more I listen, the deeper I sink and
Ooh, I go higher
And I say, ooh, a-ooh, I go higher
This head that I hold, no, it's so tired
And I say, oh, no, I go higher
And I say, ooh,
What's it gon', what's it gonna be,
Make me say, ooh,
What's it gon', what's it gonna be
I'm feelin' so cold,
What they want, what they want from me
Make me say ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (they want, they gonna be)

I'm sinking, ooh, I go higher
And I say, ooh, a-ooh, I go higher
Get no sleep, meet the vampire
And I say, ooh, no, I go higher
And I say, ooh, I go higher
And I say, ooh, a-ooh, I go higher
This head that I hold, no, it's so tired
And I say, ooh, no, I go higher
