Rollercoasters and Earl Gray Malts,
Hasta La Babies but not bath salts,
Harvest moon in the arms of a tree,
Which has been growing there for centuries.

Bassoons, trombones and French horn sections
Bass clarinets and string odd collections.
Owls and good saws when they do not match
Gilda, Kristen, Cheri, Tina, Amy and Rachael Dratch.

All these things, they're just disappointing,
All these things, they're just disappointing compared to you.
There's nothing more beautiful than your smile as it conquers your face.
There's nothing more comforting than to know, know you exist in this time, in this place.

The genitive case in German, it's true,
Is something that I'm quite partial to.
Rachmaninov, Scriabin, Prokofiev,
Dostoevsky, Bulgakov, Vysotsky n Lev

Francis Bacon, The Dolomites,
Ballet dancers with or without tights.
Central Park on an autumn day
Will always be stunning and never clich√©.

All these things, they're just disappointing,
All these things, they're just disappointing compared to you.
There's nothing more beautiful than your smile as it conquers your face.
There's nothing more comforting than to know, know you exist in this time, in this place.

All these things, they're just disappointing,
All these things, they're just disappointing compared to you.
There's nothing more beautiful than your smile as it conquers your face.
There's nothing more comforting than to know, know you exist in this time, in this place.
