Lord she's handsome as she flows across the floor
Nothing I've seen in my life has ever pleased me more
She's got the look of freedom and it makes you think she's wild
But I can see right through it all, it's a way to have a child

Oh walk away
She's looking to love you
There's nothing to say
Just turn your head and walk away
Walk away, walk on

She moves in sunlight, never seen the night at all
Like a star in the midnight sky burns before it falls
I've never been lonely and I can't imagine why
Maybe she can be the one to tell me, I guess it's do or die

Can't see her fire
But I can feel her heat, all right
It's rising higher
I'm walking the wire

Walk on by

Oh walk away
She's looking to love you
There's nothing to say
Just turn your head and walk away
Oh walk on by, walk away
Walk on, walk on, walk on, walk away

You'll feel her fire
She'll lift you higher
But don't be fooled
Just turn your head and walk away
Walk away
