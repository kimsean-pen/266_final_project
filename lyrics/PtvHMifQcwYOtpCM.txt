I only hear you from a distance now
I still feel sad, sometimes
Still get the feeling, oh the feeling
Of being mistreated
I only hear you
I only hear you from a distance now

I should have told you, right away
Cause I ain't no fool, no fool anymore
That the good times, all the good times we had
And the bad times, all the bad times we had
I only hear you
I only hear you from a distance now

We never got to talk about, to talk about
All the rights and the wrongs, the rights and the wrongs
That we kept in our hearts, hidden in our hearts
So what good is it, what good is it
I only hear you
I only hear you from a distance now
