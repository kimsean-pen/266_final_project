Day gives way to night on the storefront mannequins,
The audience with Mona Lisa grins.

Moonlight builds emotion as the players scuttle in.
Pull the curtain back and let the show begin.

Moon of mischief under low-light discipline.
Hear the tiny monsters hunt the harlequin.

Silent patrons view the drama under low-light discipline.
Hear the tiny monsters hunt the harlequin.

Moon of mischief, we kill, be killed, or run,
To be or not to be the only one.
