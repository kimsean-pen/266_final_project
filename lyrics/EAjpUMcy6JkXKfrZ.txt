Cannot recognise the face before me
It's unfamiliar
Tell this laughing, broken down and lonely
Can you still see me, I'm disguised?

Outside the window of your life
Clinging to the memory of your pride
After many years alone you wonder
Left me here alone with private waters

On your toes or on your heels
There's a hole in the floor
Where the blood has dried there is no shame
Have another cold my friend so you can't feel anymore
While you question just who the hell am I

Is this all I am
Given all I can
Is this all I am

'til the end of time, never knowing why
Ghosts and damage, no advantage for me
I'm passed believing
Understand the price you pay, disarming
When you can leave it all behind

Outside the window of your life
Clinging to the memory of your pride
After many years alone you wonder
Left me here alone with private waters

On your toes or on your heels
There's a hole in the floor
Where the blood has dried there is no shame
Have another cold my friend so you can't feel anymore
While you question just who the hell am I

Is this all I am
Given all I can
Is this all I am

'til the end of time, never knowing why

Cannot recognise the face before me
It's unfamiliar
