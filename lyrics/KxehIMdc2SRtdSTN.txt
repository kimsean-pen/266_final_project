How many miles do I need behind my
tires before my problems start to vanish?
Do you think that I could manage to up
and run away rather than face the day to day.
Somehow my underwhelming life's too overwhelming here tonight. (
So I'll run away) But if I left it all
behind would it bring me peace of mind?
Or would it eat me up inside?

How far do you think that I could make it
before all my mistakes would catch up with me?
How hard do you think that it could be to say goodbye to everything?
Because I'm leaving on the count of three.

Is it so wrong to want to disappear?
Although I know a better man would stand and face his fears.
I never claimed to be a hero or a martyr.
I'm just a kid without the guts to finish what he started.

Maybe I'll grow out of this or maybe I'll grow into something worse.
The only thing I know for certain's I've never felt so unsure.
Am I alone in this confusion?
Am I the only person here with no clue what they're doing?
But if I left it all behind do you think I'd be all right?

before all my mistakes would catch up with me?
