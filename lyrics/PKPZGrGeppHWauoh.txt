Do you know what it feels like
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?
Do you know what it feels like
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed?

Do you know?
Do you know?
Do you know?
Do ya?

If birds flying south is a sign of changes
At least you can predict this every year
Love, you never know the minute it ends suddenly
I can't get it to speak

Maybe finding all the things it took to save us
I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me
Look in your eyes to see something about me
I'm standing on the edge and I don't know what else to give

Do you know what it feels like
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?
Do you know what it feels like
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed?

Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
Do ya

How can I love you
How can I love you
How can I love you
How can I love you
If you just don't talk to me, babe

I flow through my act, there's a question "is she needed?"
And decide all the man I can ever be
Looking at the last 3 years like I did
I could never see us ending like this

(Do you know?)
Seeing your face no more on my pillow
Is a scene that's never happened to me
(Do you know?)
But after this episode I don't see
You could never tell the next thing life could be

Do you know what it feels like
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?
Do you know what it feels like
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed?

Do you know?
Do you know?

Do you know what it feels like
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?
Do you know what it feels like
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed?

Do you know?

Do you know what it feels like
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?
Do you know what it feels like
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed?
