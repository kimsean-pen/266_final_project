You, you were perfect who knows how it happened
When all you see comes crashing, down around you
Run, run as fast as you can

You, you were faster when all of that mattered
But in the end we lost you and all of us screamed
"Run, run as fast as you can"

Grieve the dreams, they're at the end, the end
Writhe and scream until the end, the end
Grieve the dreams, they're at the end, the end
Writhe and scream until the end, the end

We were close before, now nothing's there between us
Shouting from the floor, cherry flavored bullets
When you sleep every night, no one holds you tight
And all you hear forever is "run, run as fast as you can"
