And I don't think I've got this in me
And I don't feel the way you do
It's been a while now and it kills me to say that
It's just too much
And I

I think I've had enough
I think I've had enough

And I feel like I haven't slept in months
And it takes everything I have to get up
It has for a while now, it kills me to say it
It just too much
And I

I think I've had enough
I think I've had enough

Please, take me home
Please, take me home

I think I've had enough
I think I've had enough
