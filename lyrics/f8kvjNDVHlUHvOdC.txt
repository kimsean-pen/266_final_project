I can see no devil in the field
just many trees and papa's many seas
come on down

i can see no devil in the field
just many trees and papa's many seas
come on down

and as the house will burn and rust we will discern the lives we lost

i can see no devil in the field
just many trees and papa's many seas
come on down
come on down
come on down
come on down

i been wrong
i been alone
i been touched
i been told
i been beat
admitted defeat
they'll take me away
on this cursed day

and as the house will burn and rust we will discern the lives we lost

come on down come on down

and as the house will burn and rust we will discern the lives we lost
