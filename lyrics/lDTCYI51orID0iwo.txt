Boy, I saw you soon as you came bouncin' through the door
You and your mans and them just look over the floor
Started doin' your thing and it made me notice you even more
The way, you turned around and looked at me it seemed as though
You must have somehow felt me starin' on the low
Somethin' tells me you're the kind of guy I'd like to get to know

I ain't even gonna front, I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club, I've been givin' you the eye
We can dance if you want, get it crackin' if you like
Must be a full moon, feel like one of those nights

Why, is this the first time that I'm seein' you around
Could you be visiting or are you new in town?
Yeah, whatever the case, I'm feelin' you right here and right now
Your smile, and all the love you showin' lets me know that you
Like what you see and wanna get to know me too
This could very well be the start of somethin' special
Happy that I met you

I ain't even gonna front, I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club, I've been givin' you the eye
We can dance if you want, get it crackin' if you like
That must be a full moon, felt like one of those nights

I ain't even gonna front, I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club, I've been givin' you the eye
We can dance if you want, get it crackin' if you like
It must be a full moon, felt like one of those nights

I didn't think that I'd come here tonight
Meet someone like you, start feeling the way I do
Seems like we've known each other most of our lives
After one conversation, this must be right

I ain't even gonna front, I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club, I've been givin' you the eye
We can dance if you want, get it crackin' if you like
It must be a full moon, felt like one of those nights

I ain't even gonna front, I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club, I've been givin' you the eye
We can dance if you want, get it crackin' if you like
It must be a full moon, felt like one of those nights

I ain't even gonna front, I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club, I've been givin' you the eye
We can dance if you want, get it crackin' if you like
It must be a full moon felt like one of those nights
