I've got bubble letters, you've got bubble letters
it spells HA HA HA when we put them together
I've got bubble letters, you've got bubble letters
it spells HA HA HA when we put them together
i did a painting where we're all falling down
if you turn it inside out we're just flying around
don't be intimidated, its not the bomb
Obama made me do it and the air conditioner's on

I'm a conspiracy

i said i know about that like a myth in the dirt
and that's not how it works
and you're not why it hurts
she's got something humming from this beneath this earth
and it's stressing me out but she's taking off my shirt
