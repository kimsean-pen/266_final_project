Where have you gone my darlin' one?
Are you on your own, are you havin' fun?
Is there someone to hold when you need it bad
Is it uncontrolled like the love we had
Does the day go by like a memory?
Do you ever try to remember me?
In an automobile or a crowded bar
Well I hope you're all right wherever you are
And if you're still within the sound of my voice?
Over some radio, I just want you to know
You were always my only choice
And wherever you go
That I still love you so
If you're still within the sound of my voice?
In the dead of night, do you hear me call?
Something's not quite right, no one's there at all
Did you make a mistake, was it in your head?
Or was it really me talkin' to your heart instead
And if you're still within the sound of my voice?
Watchin' this video, I just want you to know
That it always made me rejoice
Just to have you so near
There's a place for you here
If you're still within the sound of my voice?
I am calling like the echo of a passing train that cries
One last time before it fades into the distant hills and dies
I am sending out a message, like a ship out on the sea
In distress but only you can send a lifeline out to me
Are you still within the sound of my voice?
Why don't you let me know?
I just can't let you go
If it's wrong then I have no choice
But to love you until I no longer have a will
Are you still within the sound of my voice?
I am calling like the echo of a passing train that cries
One last time before it fades into the distant hills and dies
