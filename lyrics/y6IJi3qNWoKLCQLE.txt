Hello, it's us again
We're still so in love with you
And yes, we mean it too
Yes, we're so in love with you

Hello, it's us again
You thought you were our friends
Success is an ugly word
Especially in your tiny world

The masses against the classes
I'm tired of giving a reason
When the future is what we believe in
We love the winter, it brings us closer together

So can you hurt us any more?
Can you feel like it was before
Or are you lost for evermore?
Messed up and dead on alcohol

Hello fond farewell, my dear
I hope you hear this nice and clear
Our love is unconditional
Our hate is yours to feed upon

The masses against the classes
I'm tired of giving a reason
When the future is what we believe in
We love the winter, it brings us closer together

The masses against the classes
I'm tired of giving a reason
When we're the only thing left to believe in
We love the winter, it brings us closer together
