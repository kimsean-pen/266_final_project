Scarlet and red, flaming sunset in the distance
You're going down on the prowl, sea goddess
Never to rest, all obsessed in thy search far northwest
Vigilant eyes coming to life once again
Here in the night, in the depths of the sea
Searching the deep infinitely with desired and greed

Coming alive, thrive in the night, sleeping in the fire
Chest of gold, dreams unfold, burning with desire
You are my treasure, haven and pleasure, my pearls and gold

Give me a gust, give me the wind and that horizon
Give me nine waves, seaman's grave, endless sleep
I honour thee eternally, RÃ¡n - my goddess of the sea
At the seashore or ocean floor, always searching
Precious treasures all bound for your net
All you possess my sea goddess you will wear as a dress

Coming alive, thrive in the night, sleeping in the fire
Chest of gold, dreams unfold, burning with desire
You are my treasure, haven and pleasure, my pearls and gold

Coming alive, thrive in the night, sleeping in the fire
Chest of gold, dreams unfold, burning with desire
You are my treasure, haven and pleasure, my pearls and gold
