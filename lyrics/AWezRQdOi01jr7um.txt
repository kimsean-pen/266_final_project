Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I messed up tonight
I lost another fight
Lost to myself, but I'll just start again

I keep falling down
I keep on hitting the ground
But I always get up now to see what's next

Birds don't just fly
They fall down and get up
Nobody learns without getting it wrong

I won't give up
No, I won't give in till I reach the end
And then I'll start again
No, I won't leave
I want to try everything
I want to try even though I could fail

I won't give up
No, I won't give in till I reach the end
Then I'll start again
No, I won't leave
I want to try everything
I want to try even though I could fail

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Try everything
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Try everything
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Try everything
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Look how far you've come
You filled your heart with love
Baby, you've done enough
Take a deep breath

Don't beat yourself up
No need to run so fast
Sometimes we come last, but we did our best

I won't give up
No, I won't give in till I reach the end
And then I'll start again
No, I won't leave
I want to try everything
I want to try even though I could fail

I won't give up
No, I won't give in till I reach the end
Then I'll start again
No, I won't leave
I want to try everything
I want to try even though I could fail

I'll keep on making those new mistakes
I'll keep on making them every day
Those new mistakes

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Try everything
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Try everything
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Try everything
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Try everything
