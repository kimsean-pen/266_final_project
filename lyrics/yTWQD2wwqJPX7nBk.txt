Show me your hand
Then tell me you're not afraid to lose
While we're still young
While we're still twisting 21
Don't hold the wildest cards
And you've drawn the queen of hearts

Go call your mother
She can make it better
Tell your father
That you really fucked up

Give me nothing
You won it all
Give me a sign
'Cause I'm busy gloating in my mind
There's no need to run
And we're only twisting 21
Chasing the ghost in your bet
You get a grip
I'll move ahead

Go call your mother
She can make it better
Tell your father
That you really fucked up
Call your mother
She can make it better
Tell your father
That you really fucked up

Lightweight silk heart starting to fray
Yeah, our lightweight young hearts waiting to break
Lightweight silk heart starting to fray
Yeah, our lightweight young hearts waiting to break

Call your mother
She can make it better
Tell your father
That you really fucked up
Give me nothing
You won it all
Give me nothing
You won it all
