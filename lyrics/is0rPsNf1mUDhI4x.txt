Ho! Hey!
Ho! Hey!

Ho! I've been trying to do it right
Hey! I've been living a lonely life
Ho! I've been sleeping here instead
Hey! I've been sleeping in my bed

Ho! Sleeping in my bed

Hey! Ho!

Ho! So show me family
Hey! All the blood that I would bleed
Ho! I don't know where I belong
Hey! I don't know where I went wrong

Ho! But I can write a song

Hey! One, two, three

I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweet (Ho!)
Hey!
Ho! (hey!) Hey!

Ho! I don't think you're right for him
Hey! Look at what it might have been if you
Ho! Took a bus to China Town
Hey! I'd be standing on Canal

Ho! And Bowery

Hey!

Ho! She'd be standing next to me

Hey! (One, two, three)

I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweetheart

Love, we need it now
Let's hope for some
'Cause, oh, we're bleeding out

I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me, you're my sweet (Ho!)

Hey!
Ho! (The last one)
Hey!
