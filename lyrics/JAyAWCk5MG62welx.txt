It took a while to mend this broken heart of mine
The memories expand and fill the space and time
I was living in a world dressed in disguise
With your cover blown you had no place to hide

And I was only trying to mind my own business

I can't believe I caught you out there playing games
The more you try denying the more you fan the flames
It's no more living in the world dressed in disguise
With your cover blown you had no place to hide

And I was only trying to mind my own business
Yeah I was only trying to mind my own business

Baby I was lonely in our bed so many nights
Thinking you were out there working thinking you would do me right
You come strolling in the sunlight and I listen to your lies
Well not this time
Not this time, well
Smoking cigarettes at night waiting for you to come
So silent in our home that I was bouncing off the walls
Tell me who is he and does he mean anything at all to you this time
Ooh this time well

Not this time yeah
Not this time
Not this time well
Not this time
Not this time yeah
Not this time
Not this time well
Not this time whoa

Baby I ain't no fool so I cannot understand
How I gave it up and trusted you with everything I had
No more living in the world dressed in disguise
With your cover blown you had no place to hide

And I was only trying to mind my own business
Yeah I was only trying to mind my own business

Baby I was lonely in our bed so many nights
Thinking you were out there working thinking you would do me right
You come strolling in the sunlight and I listen to your lies
Well not this time
Not this time, well
Smoking cigarettes at night waiting for you to come
So silent in our home that I was bouncing off the walls
Tell me who is he and does he mean anything at all to you this time
Ooh this time well

Not this time yeah
Not this time
Not this time well
Not this time
Not this time yeah
Not this time
Not this time well
Not this time
Not this time yeah
Not this time
Not this time well
Not this time
Not this time yeah
Not this time
Not this time well
Not this time
Not this time
Not this time well
Not this time
Not this time well
Not this time
Not this time well
