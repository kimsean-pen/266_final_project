I want you to remember
A love so full it could send us all ways
I want you to surrender
All my feelings rose today
And I want you to remain
The power of children can amaze
I'll try not to complain
I know that's a pisser baby
The chemicals between us
The walls that lie between us
Lying in this bed
The chemicals displaced
There is no lonelier state
Lying in this bed

I want you to remember
Everything you said
Every driven word
Like a hammer
Hell, to my head
The chemicals between us
The walls that lie between us
Lying in this bed
The chemicals displaced
There is no lonelier face
Lying in this bed
The chemicals between us
The chemicals between us
Lying in this bed

We're of the hollow men
We are the naked ones
We never meant you harm
Never meant you wrong
I'd like to thank all of my lovers, lovers, lovers

The chemicals between us
The army of achievers
Lying in this bed
The chemicals displaced
There is no lonelier state
Lying in this bed
The chemicals between us
The chemicals between us
The chemicals
The chemicals between us
