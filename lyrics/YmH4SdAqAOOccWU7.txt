Darkness...
Fear...
Life...
Cold...

Left alone with no will
Walking in footsteps of the fallen
Blinded by lack of reason
Indulging the tales of doom

"Farewell,
May the darkness bind them
No one will
Remember the pain when we are... gone..."

Desolate...
Unconscious...
Lost...

Where lays the ones I've slain?
Did I become any wiser?
Will their anger hunt me down?
Did I sacrifice in vain?

"Farewell,
Hear the sound of solitude
No one will
Walk the bridge, to darkness overcome"

Settlement...
Trust...
Relief...
Dawn...

Guide me, watcher in the skies
Transform the forces of the dead
In my dreams I'll hunt them down
I now know the truth
