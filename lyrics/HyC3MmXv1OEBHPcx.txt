Hey Moonshine you got me dreaming
Hey moonshine your light is beaming
Oh why go shine on someone else

Hey moonshine in the night sky
Hey moonshine I'll never know why
I'm alone and staring up to you

You can just laugh 'cause when the morning comes
All you promised just disappeared in the noonday sun

Hey Moonshine you cast a silver pool
Why don't you catch some other fool
I know your tricks so please leave me alone

Hey moonshine in the night sky
You won't catch me so don't you even try
I'm alone and I know the reason why

You can just laugh' cause when the morning comes
All you promised just disappeared in the noonday sun

Hey Moonshine you couldn't let it be
Midnight rays have got a hold of me
You always seem to have it your own way
