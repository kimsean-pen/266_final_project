(I can see)
I'm not gonna stop you
You talk so sweet

And it's dribbling like honey
It's just one taste
I see just what you're tryin' to do
Oh oh, yeah yeah

It's hard
Stakes are getting higher
No love for free man
It costs if you're the buyer
My life's for me
I see what you're tryin' to do, oh oh

(Come on)
Lazy lover, oh you
Slide me through your
Slide me through your
Lazy lover, I will slide
Through your window

And I'll give you, oh
The sweetest dreams you ever had
Make your early morning not so bad
I can see just what you're tryin' to do

That's a nice house
I like what you've done with the place
Your gingerbread and that
Greedy smile upon your face
I can see what you're tryin' to do, oh oh

(Come on)
Lazy lover, oh you
Slide me through your
Slide me through your
Lazy lover, I will slide
Through your window

And I'll give you the sweetest dreams you ever had
Make your early morning not so bad
I can see just what you're tryin' to do

But don't worry
I say get it over with
'Cause what you want to know, you've got it
On your finger tips

Don't you ask for more
That wave just tumbles me round
Till I'm lost somewhere-where
Baby I just can't make a sound

It's so unfortunate
But I've already been through this
And I can see just what you're tryin' to do
I can see just what you need to do
