When the moon is high in the heavens,
"And the sharp winds howl like wolves."

I lay in the darkness twisting and turning,
"My mind won't give me any peace."

I dream of when we were as one
My secret passion is known to none.
If only I could turn back time
"When your lips and heart they were only mine."

They were only mine...

Why do I think of our past together?
Your face haunts me - forever and ever
Dreaming of our time together
Your beauty haunts me, forever and ever

I dream of when we were as one,
my secret passion is known to none.
If only I could turn back time,
"When on my erected pride you were sliding down"

You were sliding down...

"Now I'm gone, after all"

Why do I think of our past together?
Your face haunts me - forever and ever
Dreaming of our time together
Your beauty haunts me, forever and ever

"Of all the shinning stars - you shine brightest of them all."

Why do I think of our past together?
Your face haunts me - forever and ever
Dreaming of our time together
Your beauty haunts me, forever and ever

In my dreams we are still together
Forever and ever...

Please let me sleep, forever...

And ever...

Forever and ever
