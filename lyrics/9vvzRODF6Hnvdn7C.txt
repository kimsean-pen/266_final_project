Chew my love
Under your tongue like it's your
Bubblegum
You're blowin' bubbles 'til
The taste is gone
You're coming over for the night
One night, one night, one night

Chew my love
Under your tongue like it's your
Bubblegum
Just spit me out when it becomes
More than fun
Cause I'm coming over for the night
One night, one night, one night

Conversation is violent
Baby you're too digital
Arbitrated physical
But keep me under your ceiling
Cause your concrete's chippin' in
Crumbling like grease on me, oh no
Don't take this swim for more than it is
It's one night, one night, one night

Chew my love
Under your tongue like it's your
Bubblegum
You're blowin' bubbles 'til
The taste is gone
You're coming over for the night
One night, one night, one night

Chew my love
Under your tongue like it's your
Bubblegum
Just spit me out when it becomes
More than fun
Cause I'm coming over for the night
One night, one night, one night

And now I'll pull you in close
It's a sweet and sour high
When you promise not to try
If I promise that I'd lie
We can drink the punch for this one last time
Just one more last time

Chew my love
Under your tongue like it's your
Bubblegum
You're blowin' bubbles 'til
The taste is gone
You're coming over for the night
One night, one night, one night

Chew my love
Under your tongue like it's your
Bubblegum
Just spit me out when it becomes
More than fun
Cause I'm coming over for the night
One night, one night, one night
One night, one night, one night
One night, one night, one night
One night, one night...
One night
