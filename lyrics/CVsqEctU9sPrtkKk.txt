Laa...

I wasn't jealous before we met

now every woman I see is a potential threat.
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice.
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice.
But now it isn't true
now everything is new
and all I've learned has overturned.
I beg of you...
Don't go wasting your emotion

lay all your love on me.
(don't go sharing your devotion)
It was like shooting a sitting duck.

A little smalltalk, a smile, and baby I was stuck.
I still don't know what you've done with me
a grown-up woman should never fall so easily.
I feel a kind of fear
when I don't have you near.
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you dear...
Don't go wasting your emotion

lay all your love on me.
Don't go sharing your devotion
lay all your love on me.
I've had a few little love affairs.

They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce.
I used to think I was sensible
it makes the truth even more incomprehensible.
'Cause everything is new
and everything is you
and all I've learned has overturned.
What can I do?
Don't go wasting your emotion

lay all your love on me.
Don't go sharing your devotion
lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
lay all your love on me.
Don't go sharing your devotion
lay all your love on me. (don't go)
Don't go wasting your emotion
lay all your love on me.
Don't go sharing your devotion...
