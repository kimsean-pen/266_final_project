I got a secret
What I've done ain't right
I got a secret
What I've done ain't right
The blame comes and goes
Eating at my soul
Where was my mind?

There was a snake charmer
Calling out my name
There was a snake charmer
Calling out my name
For my darkest thoughts
A couple bourbon shots
And I was game

It is a comfort
Veiling out the guilt
But when the devil comes
Our peace it jilts
I check both sides of streets
But my conscious' flees
God, help me see
