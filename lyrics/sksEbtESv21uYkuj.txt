I've been through the fire
I felt embers down my spine
And I've said "World would you please have some mercy on me?
Or could you please lift the curses on me?"
I said, you always did
Like it the hard way since you was a kid
Look at the scars on your leg, you know
You keep choosing the wild road

Ooh, I'm not sorry
Stay sick cause I follow my gut
They say I was pushing my luck
Ima push me a matte all black truck
No, I'm not sorry
Stay sick cause I follow my gut
They say I was pushing my luck
Ima push me a all black truck
Ima push me a all black truck
Ima push me a matte all-

I been through the storm
I heard thunder in my heart
And I've said "World would you please shine a light up on me?
Or would you show me a sign you love me?"
I said, you always did
Like it the hard way since you was a kid
Time after time, again
You keep the choosing the wild road
