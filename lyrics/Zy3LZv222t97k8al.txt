Stranger
I don't see you like I used to
It was a thievery of my eye
So long
You keep chasing like a rooster
Everything you lay eyes on

So I flee
I fly
I don't have no choice
I would rather
I would rather die
Than live with you in this life
Than live with you in this life

Cause you're just a backslider every single day
Backsliding like a chain
You're just a capturer on a lonely chase
Backslide into your grave

My babe
Guess he could stand a little cheatin'
Because his heart is made of stone
And now
I ain't got tears to cry, I'm leavin'
Even in your arms I'm alone

You go back to your old flame
And she'll love you once again
I'm just a blockade at this game
Your lips are lies
And your eyes the same

You're just a backslider every single day
Backsliding like a chain
You're just a capturer on a lonely chase
Backslide into your grave

You're just a backslider every single day
Backsliding like a chain
You're just a capturer on a lonely chase
Backslide into your grave
