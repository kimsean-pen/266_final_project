Every part of It beats
While time proceeds to rise In salt
Then slowly recedes
Dissolve and appear
A place that comes along
Hearing her timbre
It takes you away
And you call out

You push and receive
You know to call out

Every moment a seed
A tiny pit can rise or fall
But no one will receive
Resolve, reappear
Oh lazy girl alone
Heated In temper

It takes you away
And you call out

You push and receive
You know to call out

It takes you away
And you call out

You push and receive
You know to call out
