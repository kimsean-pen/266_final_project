Live with your back to the wall
The bigger they come, the harder they fall
Live with a heart made of stone
Slings and arrows and broken bones

One by one by one by one
Kings rise and fall
One by one by one by one
Heavy lies this crown of bones

Yeah, darkness behold
Yeah, this hell we call home
Yeah, darkness behold
Yeah, this hell we call home

Live with the eyes of the beast
Never the prey, the weak, or the sheep
Live with the strength to believe
Dead to the world, but we'll haunt their dreams

One by one by one by one
Kings rise and fall
One by one by one by one
Heavy lies this crown of bones
Yeah

Yeah, darkness behold
Yeah, this hell we call home
Yeah, darkness behold
Yeah, this hell we call home

Burn it, burn it all, burn it all to ash
Burn it, burn it all, burn it all to ash
Burn it, burn it all, burn it all to ash
Burn it, burn it all, burn it all to ash
Burn it, burn it all, burn it all to ash
Burn it, burn it all, burn it all to ash
Burn it, burn it all, burn it all to ash
Burn it, burn it all, burn it all to ash
Burn it all to ashes

Yeah, darkness behold
Yeah, this hell we call home
Yeah, darkness behold
Yeah, this hell we call
Yeah, darkness behold
Yeah, this hell we call home
Yeah, darkness behold
Yeah, this hell we call home
