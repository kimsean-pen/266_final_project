When i fall in love if will be forever
Or i'll never fall in love in a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun
When i give my heart it will be completely

Or i'll never give my heart
And the moment i can feel
That you feel that way too
Is when i fall in love with you
Maybe i'm old fashioned feeling as i do

Mabye i am living in the past
But when i meet the right one
I know that i'll be true
My first love will be my last
