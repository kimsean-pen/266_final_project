In a forest pitch dark
Glowed the tiniest spark
It burst into a flame
Like me
Like me

My name Is-obel
Married to myself
My love Isobel
Living by herself

In a heart full of dust
Lives a creature called lust
It surprises and scares
Like me
Like me

My name Is-obel
Married to myself
My love Isobel
Living by herself

When she does it, she means to
Moth delivers her message
Unexplained on your collar
Crawling in silence
A simple excuse

Nana na nana
Nana na nana

In a tower of steel
Nature forges a deal
To raise wonderful hell
Like me
Like me

My name Is-obel
Married to myself
My love Isobel
Living by herself

When she does it, she means to
Moth delivers her message
Unexplained on your collar
Crawling in silence
A simple excuse

Nana na nana
Nana na nana
Nana na nana
Nana na nana
