The drumbeat never changes tempo
It's steady like a rock
And like a rock it crushes you as it gets louder
The drum gets louder and louder
And you know there is no parking on the dance floor

And when you wake up you can feel your hair grow
Crawl out of your cave and you can watch your shadow
Creep across the ground until the day is done
All the while the planet circles 'round the sun
Everybody knows how this goes so let's get over it
And let's get this over with

Even when you're out of work you still have a job to do
Even when you don't know what it is
Your job knows what it is
What it is is it's coming to get you
I'm talking to myself even when I'm saying "you"

And when you wake up you can feel your hair grow
Crawl out of your cave and you can watch your shadow
Creep across the ground until the day is done
All the while the planet circles 'round the sun
Everybody knows how this goes so let's get over it
And let's get this over with

After all the spelling mistakes
After all the groping in the dark
Can this page of strange gibberish
Get a final punctuation mark?

You're still hanging around the clambake
After every clam has been baked
No applause
Awkward pause
Hand extended waiting for a shake

And when you wake up you can feel your hair grow
Crawl out of your cave and you can watch your shadow
Creep across the ground until the day is done
All the while the planet circles 'round the sun
Everybody knows how this goes so let's get over it
And let's get this over with

Hurry up and let's get this over with
You don't have to go home but you can't stay here
Everybody knows how this goes so let's get over it
And let's get this over with
