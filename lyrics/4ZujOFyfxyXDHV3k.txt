Mother!
You're holding my heart, screaming.
Motherfucker!
They left me broken, bleeding.
Son of...
The man you loved and left for.
The son of a bitch!
Who tried to show me death's door.

Everything's eliminated.
Everything is dedicated.
My belief destroyed my hated?
Never get what's overrated.

Love song for the dear departed.
Head stone for the broken hearted.
Arms to kill or flowers to steal?
Head trip for the mortal earthbound.
One sip of the blood that I found.
Lying here, I'm dying here.

As in...
Obituaries rain down.
It's okay!
We're lying naked face down.

Wasn't it decapitated?
Can you see me fascinated?
You're the only thing I've damaged
What you get to be mismanaged

Love song for the dear departed.
Head stone for the broken hearted.
Arms to kill or flowers to steal?
Head trip for the mortal earthbound.
One sip of the blood that I found.
Lying here, I'm dying here.

Don't bring me daffodils,
Bring a bouquet of pills.
See some geranium,
Cracked to the cranium.
Protect me when you can,
Respect me when I am,
Dying!

Love song for the dear departed.
Head stone for the broken hearted.
Arms to kill or flowers to steal?
Head trip for the mortal earthbound.
One sip of the blood that I found.
Lying here, I'm dying here.
Love song for the dear departed.
Head stone for the broken hearted.
Arms to kill or flowers to steal?
Head trip for the mortal earthbound.
One sip of the blood that I found.
Lying here, I'm dying here.
