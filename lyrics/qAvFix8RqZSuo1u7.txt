Love decay, love cast away
Words crumble into dust
Skin to skin
You're innocent but who am I to trust?

I feel the blow to turn around
Make love revive just one more time
Can we be creatures of the night?

I am bound to live forever
I'm alive enough to sense you
Why am I hiding?
Are we only dying?

Your breath of life
I feel your warmth like sunshine on a rock
Sin by sin
You're innocent and who am I to trust

I don't know how to turn this page
Make life revive, some day it ends
Can we be lovers in the light?

I am bound to live forever
I'm alive enough to sense you
Why am I hiding?
Are we only dying?

I am cursed to love in darkness
I'm alive enough to touch you
Why am I breathing?
Am I only dying to crumble into dust?

Why am I thriving?
Why am I denying?
Why am I longing?

I feel the blow to turn around
Make love revive just one more time
Can we be creatures of the night?

I am cursed to love in darkness
I'm alive enough to touch you
Why am I breathing?
Am I only dying to crumble into dust?

Are we only dying?
Crumble into dust

Love decay
