Whoa, whoa, whoa
Na-na-na-na
Tonight Here I am
There you are
This is the good life
Looking up at the stars
You know it's our time

'Cause we're here and in love
Tomorrow doesn't mean a thing
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
So we're young and we got some dirty minds
Ripped jeans and a bottle for the night We're the kids who can bring the world to life
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

So we're dumb and got some time to waste
Gotta go with the pocket full of change Tonight gonna make the best mistake
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Take me there
You know I really wanna go
Take me there
We'll never have to be alone
Moonlight It's a shot in the dark
But it's a good time
Yeah we're making a mark

And if it feels right
Take a piece of my heart
Tomorrow doesn't mean a thing
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
So we're young and we got some dirty minds

Ripped jeans and a bottle for the night We're the kids who can bring the world to life
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
So we're dumb and got some time to waste
Gotta go with the pocket full of change Tonight gonna make the best mistake
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Take me there
You know I really wanna go
Take me there
We'll never have to be alone
Take me there

Whoa whoa-oh-oh
Take me there
Whoa whoa-oh-oh
Take me there
Whoa whoa-oh-oh
Take me there
Whoa whoa-oh-oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Na-na-na-na
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Na-na-na-na

Take me there
Take me there
Take me there
You know I really wanna go
Take me there
We'll never have to be alone
Take me there
Whoa whoa-oh-oh
Take me there
Whoa whoa-oh-oh
Take me there
Whoa whoa-oh-oh
Take me there
Whoa whoa-oh-oh
