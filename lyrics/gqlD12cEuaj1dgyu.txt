Stepping out, away from a burning heat
The water we drink has never tasted this sweet
Fevered devotion, deep as the ocean
Saved us from what should have been
Cool winds will blow, we'll try to show how we feel

In your beat
Dancing with me

Overcome, drowned by a deafening roar
Heard it above, it's something we can't ignore
Night is eroding, daylight has broken
Bathed in the light of the sun
Melting away, we'll try to gauge how we feel

In your beat
Dancing with me
In your beat
Dancing with me

Why we gotta be so damn low?
Why we gotta be so damn low once again?
Why we gotta be so damn low?
Why we gotta be so damn low once again?

In your beat
Dancing with me
In your beat
Dancing with me
