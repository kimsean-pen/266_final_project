Survivalist

Silence grows, aware of the shadows
Death grips in the blink of an eye
Acknowledgement creates trepidation
Verity takes on no disguise

Is it all for nothing
To stop this demise?
Will I be strong enough
To buy us more time?

Will I become just a fading memory?
Will I become
Will I become just a fading memory?

My endeavor fight and outrun
Cleanse and move on, survivalist
My endeavor fight and outrun
Cleanse and move on, survivalist

Losing sight of all that has mattered
This is not my legacy
Untouchable strength and intention
A mammoth test of integrity

Is it all for nothing
To stop this demise?
Will I be strong enough
To buy us more time?

Survivalist

A lifetime impending
I'm stalling, the darkness can wait
Eternity's calling
I'm stalling, darkness can wait
A lifetime impending
Holding onto my home
Eternity's calling
I'm stalling, darkness can wait
A lifetime impending
Holding onto my home

Fight and outrun
Cleanse and move on
Fight and outrun
Cleanse and move on

Erase the horror
Survivalist
