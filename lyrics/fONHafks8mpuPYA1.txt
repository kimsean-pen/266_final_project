Listen, I try to question
What would you do for love?
What would you do?
Not tryna pressure
But before I give this to you
You got to be true, yeah

I'll give you one more try
I'll give you one more time
Because I can't deny
Your love, your love, your love

Yeah
I wanna be, wanna be where you are
Right now
I wanna be, wanna be where you are
With the lights out
I wanna be, wanna be where you are
Right now
I wanna be, wanna be where you are

'Cause there ain't no question
Why my door is open for you
I wanna be the one you run to yeah
Hey
Call it obsession
But my body's calling for you
I've fallen for you

I'll give it one more try
I'll give it one more time
Because I can't deny
Your love, your love, your love

I wanna be, wanna be where you are
Right now
I wanna be, wanna be where you are
With the lights out
I wanna be, wanna be where you are
Right now
I wanna be, wanna be where you are

Don't you wanna be?
