Hello and welcome to my room,
there's no easy way out,
we can sail on the rain on my yellow umbrella.

Stay back and hold your breath away,
all the clouds are in bed,
we can feed my guitars anytime in the morning,
in the morning,

in the rainbow.
Hello and welcome to my room,
there's no easy way out,
would you show me the way into Master Antenna?
in the mountains,

in the rainbow.
You are one of a kind,
you are one of a kind,
you are one of mine,

the only one in my life.
You are one of a kind,
you are one of a kind,
the only one I want

everyday of my life.
Breathe out and take your helmet off,
there's no war in my room,
we can lay on the grass, have a laugh every morning,
in the morning, ah,

in the rainbow, ah.
You are one of a kind,
you are one of a kind,
you are one of mine,
the only one in my life.
You are one of a kind,
you are one of a kind,
the only one I want
everyday of my life.
