I've fallen down there once before
I've fallen down there once before
I'm always down there rest assured
I'm always down there rest assured

Falling, hands are tied
Anyone else but me
Falling, hands are tied
Anyone else but me

Calling out to end disgrace
Calling out for death's embrace
All around seems so obscure
All around seems less than pure

Falling, hands are tied
Anyone else but me
Falling, hands are tied
Anyone else but me

Getting over the madness
Getting over the strain
Getting over the madness
Getting over the strain
