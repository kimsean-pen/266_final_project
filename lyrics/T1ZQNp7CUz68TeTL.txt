My baby baby
I want you so it scares me to death
I can't say anymore than "I love you"
Everything else is a waste of breath

I want you
You've had your fun you don't get well no more
I want you
Your fingernails go dragging down the wall
I want you
I woke up and one of us was crying
I want you
You said "little girl I do believe you're dying"
I want you
If you need a second opinion as you seem to do these days
You can look in my eyes and you can count the ways
I want you
Rob from always on the run is so bad and copy paste is a sin
I want you
Did you mean to tell me but seem to forget
I want you
Since when were you so generously inarticulate
I want you
It's the stupid details that my heart is breaking for
It's the way your shoulders shake and what they're shaking for
It's knowing that she knows you now after only guessing
It's the thought of her undressing you or you undressing
She tossed some tattered compliment your way
I want you
And you were fool enough to love it when she said
"I want you"

"I want you"

I want you
The truth can't hurt you it's just like the dark
It scares you witless
But in time you see things clear and stark
I want you
Go on and hurt me then we'll let it drop
I want you
I'm afraid I won't know where to stop

I'm not ashamed to say I cried for you
I want you

I want you
I might as well be useless for all it means to you
I want you
You've had your fun you don't get well no more
I want you
No-one else who wants you could want you more
I want you

Every night when I go off to bed
And when I wake up
I want you
I want you
I'm going to say it once again 'til I instill it
I know I'm going to feel this way until you kill it
