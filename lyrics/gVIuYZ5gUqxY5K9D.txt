You got some nerve, coming here
You got some nerve, coming here
You stole it all, give it back
You stole it all, give it back

Good morning, Mister Magpie
How are we today?
And now you stole it, all the magic
Took my memories

You know you should, but you don't
You know you should, but you don't

Good morning, Mister Magpie
How are we today?
And now you stole it, all the magic
Took my melody
