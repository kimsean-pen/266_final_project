ilu vanya, fanya, eari
i-mar, ar ilqa imen.
na uye sere indo-ninya simen, ullume;

ten si ye tyelma, yeva tyel ar i-narqelion,
fre ilqa yeva notina, hostainieva, yallume:
ananta uva tare farea, ufarea!

(The world is fair, the sky, the seas, the earth,
and all that is in them. But my heart resteth not here for ever,
for here is ending, and there will be an end and the fading,
when all is counted, and all numbered at last,
but yet it will not be enough, not enough)
