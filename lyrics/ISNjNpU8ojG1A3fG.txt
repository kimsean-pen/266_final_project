She got a bad reputation
She takes the long way home
And all of my friends seen her naked
Or so the story goes
Mistakes we all make them
But they won't, let it go
'Cause she's got a bad reputation
But I know what they don't

And I don't care what they, say about you baby
They don't know what you've been through
Trust me I could be the one to, treat you like a lady
Let me see, what's underneath
All I need is you

She got a bad reputation
Nobody gets too close
A sight of a soul when it's breaking
Makin' my heart grow cold
And into the deeper she's sinking
I'm beggin' her please, don't let go
She's got a bad reputation
But she's all that... all I want though

And I don't care what they, say about you baby
They don't know what you've been through
Trust me I could be the one to, treat you like a lady
Let me see, what's underneath
All I need is you

Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
Nobody knows the weight that's on her shoulders, said
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
She got it bad
She got it bad
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
Nobody knows the weight that's on her shoulders, said
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
She got it bad
She got it bad

They don't know what you've been through
And trust me I could be the one to, treat you like a lady
Let me see, what's underneath
All I need is you

Let me see, what's underneath
All I need is you

Let me see, what's underneath
All I need is you

She got a bad reputation
She takes the long way home
