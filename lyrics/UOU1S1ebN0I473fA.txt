Oh, everybody wants to think
They're not what they eat
That their body's great
Oh, everybody wants to think
That they're good at heart
When they're full of hate

Oh, everybody wants to think
That their luck will change
When there's no such thing
Oh, everybody wants to think
That they won't grow old
Yet they keep their change

I've been underneath the canopy
Lost in the spell
Shut up, every time you make it mean
You can't tell
In skin, sulky as a tendency
Trust what's untrue
I've been underneath the canopy
Waiting for you
