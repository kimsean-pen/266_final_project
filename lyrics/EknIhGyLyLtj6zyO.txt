We'd hit the bottom
I thought it was my fault
And in a way I guess it was
I'm just now finding out what it was all about

We'd moved to the west coast
Away from everyone
She never told me that you called
Back when I was still, I was still in love

'Till I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye, goodbye, I tried

And I twisted it wrong just to make it right
Had to leave myself behind
And I've been flying high all night
So come pick me up, I've landed

The daily dramas
She made from nothing
So nothing ever made it right

She liked to push me
And talk me back down
'Til I believed I was the crazy one
And in a way I guess I was

While I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye, goodbye, I tried

Dragging the sea of a trouble mind
Had to leave myself behind
Singing bye bye, goodbye, I tried

If you wrote me off, I'd understand it
'Cause I've been on some other planet
So come pick me up
I've landed

And you will be so
Happy to know
I've come alone
It's over

While I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye, goodbye, I tried

Down comes the reign of the telephone czar
It's okay to call
And I will answer for myself
Come pick me up

Come pick me up
I've landed
