The end is near
my summer days
All great things go away
Feel the cold comin' round the bend
Everything's going to change again.
down another day, down another day.
Oh, the winter I adore
Summers gone forever more
Someday she'll come back to me
Seasons change set me free
down another day, down another day.

Don't have to bore you with details (I'll never let you down)
and in the morning, the sunrise (will never let you down)
If I could hold you tomorrow (I'lll never let you down)
and when she's golden, the ocean (will never let you down)

The end is near, my winter fling
Change is melting everything
Now it's time to sink below
Season come, season go
down another day, down another day.

Don't have to bore you with details (I'll never let you down)
and in the morning, the sunrise... (will never let you down)
If I could hold you tomorrow (I'lll never let you down)
and When she's golden, the ocean (will never let you down)

I keep saying goodbye, saying goodbye, keep saying goodbye
she's always coming back. She keeps coming back. She keeps coming back.
I keep saying goodbye, saying goodbye, keep saying goodbye
she's always coming back. She keeps coming back. You keep coming back.

Don't have to bore you with details (I'll never let you down)
and In the morning, the sun rise... (will never let you down)
If I could hold you tomorrow (I'lll never let you down)
and When she's golden, the ocean (will never let you down)

down another day, down another day (will never let you down)
down another day, down another day
