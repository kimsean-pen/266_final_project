I hate when you go
But I hate when you're here
I was fine all alone
Before you appeared, hmm

But the second you come back
Got me talking fast, making me weak
Throwing everything off track, all your trouble

I'm in too deep
Now I know what they mean when they say
It's serious
How could this be?
When we touch, it's a dream
Oh, you're making me delirious
This is serious love
Love, love

Now I'm losing sleep
Been lost in your arms
Watching you watching me
I can feel your heart against my heart

Yeah, every time you do that
Got me talking fast, making me weak
Throwing everything off track, all your trouble

I'm in too deep
Now I know what they mean when they say
It's serious
How could this be?
When we touch, it's a dream
Oh, you're making me delirious
This is serious love
Love, love
(This is serious) Serious love
Love, love

Yeah, every time you do it
Got me talking fast, making me weak

I'm in too deep
Now I know what they mean when they say
It's serious
How could this be?
When we touch, it's a dream
Oh, you're making me delirious
This is serious love
Love, love
This is serious, serious love
Love, love
This is love
