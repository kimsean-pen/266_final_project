We built our dreams from the ashes of your nightmares
Carried our fathers' sins from the cradle to the grave
We forged a path through the darkness that you left us in
Now we ride in the belly of the beast

We are the diamonds that choose to stay coal
My generation born to witness the end of the world

Against the grain
Against the odds
Against the world
Forever the Underdogs

We are the bastard sons
We are the ones that refuse to grow cold
We are the Thorn in your side
We are the thieves in the night
And we're coming to take what's ours

No regrets
No regrets

We inherit the sins of the father, now reap the vengeance
No regrets
We inherit the sins of the father, now reap the vengeance

From the ashes of your nightmares
From the cradle to the grave
We forged a path through the darkness that you left us in
Now we ride in the belly of the beast
We are the diamonds that choose to be coal
My generation born to witness the end of the world
Born to witness the end of the world
Viva the underdog!
Viva the underdog!
Viva the underdog!
Viva the underdog!
Viva the underdog!
Viva the underdog!
Viva the underdog!
