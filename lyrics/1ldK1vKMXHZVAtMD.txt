Take away the memories.
Erase them, push them out to sea
An alternate reality,
A dream that feels so real to me.
Your thoughts on who I ought to be
Retaliating subtlety
Is all your life will ever be

Can you say that again?
Darling, you said, "Well, I swear I told you the truth."
Your memory is haunting me, baby
So trivial, yet pivotal

I left it all for you
But if it wasn't enough for you, baby
Well why didn't you just come out and say it?
Don't wake me up, don't fill my cup
You don't have the right to tell me when enough is enough, yeah
Such a waste of a pretty face, and now we're up in arms again

Can you say that again?
Darling, you said, "Well, I swear I told you the truth."
Your memory is haunting me, baby
So trivial, yet pivotal
"It'll never happen again, darling," you said,
But I knew it just wasn't true.
What you meant to me's a memory, baby
So trivial, yet pivotal

You're just a memory, you're just a memory.

I tried to slight the lies,
but I read the truth you hid behind those eyes.
Oh, what a waste of such a pretty face, baby.
Remember when you said, "I'll never let you down."

Say it to my face.
