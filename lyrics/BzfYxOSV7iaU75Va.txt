Theres a virus in my system.
Theres a virus in my brain.
Theres a virus in my system.
And its driving me insane.
Im just a lonely.
A lonely robot.
Maybe you can hear me
or maybe you still can not.

Theres a virus in my system.
Theres a virus in my brain.
Theres a virus in my system.
And its driving me insane.
I've been sending signals
through out spacee and time.
Floating radiation
flows into your mind.

Theres a virus in my system.
Theres a virus in my brain.
Theres a virus in my system.
And its driving me insane.
