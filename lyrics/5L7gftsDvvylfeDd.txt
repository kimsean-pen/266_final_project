Your words are so cold to me
Indisposed, don't hear your orders
Destroy the greatness of soul
Normalize what's in your hands

Take a look from the future
Get up from your dream and see
Deliverance soon is coming
For those who know
I take a sword in my hand now
I fight & kill Thanatos
Feel the ground under your feet
The roots so deep

Every step I chose to make
was just a kind of torture
I changed my ways
Now positive the fear became

Can't control my arms
Emergy too strong, I feel
Hypnotize myself, Blood boils inside

For those who know, I want to be
as clear, as real, as I protect
Nothingness is all around
I hate the taste of your words

Every step I chose to make
was just a kind of torture
I changed my ways
Now positive the fear became

I hate the taste of my lost illusions
I choose to live for the only
reasons I felt on the ground
I want to try
