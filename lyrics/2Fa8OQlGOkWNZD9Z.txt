Your head aches and you've had no rest
This days been one long test
Years pass too fast
Have to stop
Like an angel she appears
Created out of air
And all you troubles all your fears
Like blown away

Cause she winks at you
You feel your legs shake
You blow a kiss back
Then time stops until she turns her back

A swarm of heads turn around
And cross the street, oh
Waves of electricity
You feel the heat
You start walking fast
And blindly you're like an ant in a stack
And years pass too fast
Yet in your dreams, you know
Cause she winks at you
You feel your legs shake
You blow a kiss back
Then time stops until she turns her back
