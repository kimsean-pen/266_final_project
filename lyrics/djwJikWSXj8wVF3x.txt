Someday
They're gonna know that
You're a real human being

Caught me on a line
Filmed me just in the knick of time
You go down the road
Find what you're gonna find
Bring it back to me
We'll have a good time

Someday they're gonna know that
You're a real human being

Sideways glance
Did you figure out how to hold your face?
Someday we're gonna
Sit around and talk about
All the time we used to waste
And say, hey
It wasn't such a waste

Someday
They're gonna to know that
You're a real human being
