Massive hordes defecting
Dropping from God like flies

Wise to your temptation
Our strength turns us away from the light

Like vultures to the wounded
Twisting dogma into fact

Take refuge in illusion
No shelter from reality's storm

The waning flock still arrogant
Ignorant of their demise
Decadent halls once filled with devoted
Now crumble before their eyes

Our storm grows ever stronger
Extinguishing their light
Deny the great deceivers
The heretics will rise
Rise, rise, rise

Rise up from the ashes
Rise up from the shadows
In darkness we are one
Rise up our time has come
