If they tell me that the bees
Don't make honey anymore
What am I supposed to tell you
And if they tell me that the ocean
Is tired of her shores
Then tell me
What am I supposed to tell you

When I can't tell you anything

But the truth
I can't tell you anything
But the truth
What happens to an eagle's nest
In a storm
How does the mama
Keep the baby warm
What if the wind

Is telling us that it's time
And what if we're not ready to fly
Well I can't tell you anything
But the truth
I can't tell you anything
But the truth
Tree tops they touch the ground
In the morning walk with no sound
Hear no birds, hear no planes

Through the mud, feel the clay
Build it up, make it sing
Make it strong, give it wings

But I can't tell you anything
But the truth
And I can't tell you anything
But the truth
What is this place

Who am I
Why did we come here
What is this place
Who am I
Why did we come here
I don't know I don't know
But I don't know
That we're meant to know
I don't know I don't know
But I don't know
That we're meant to know
