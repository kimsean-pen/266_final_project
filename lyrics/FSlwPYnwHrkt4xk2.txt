Die

Pull the blood upon your face, grip dementia
I am now enslaved through hate
Suffer my fate, decide
Decide

Shot in to their blackened tombs
Death burning my eyes
Invert birth, great fiery womb
Time to ever-die
Die

Feeling death consuming
Death's head all around me

Feel death round
Feel death bound

Demons scream and pull me in
Look, behold the flesh
Kingdom built of rotting skin
Enter gates of hell

Feel death round
Feel death bound
Feel life die
Feel you die
Die
