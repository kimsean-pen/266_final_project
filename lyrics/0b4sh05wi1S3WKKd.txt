Farewell, farewell kings we once knew
Farewell, farewell to you and you

People, people in lost and found
People, people, we've hit the ground

Falling fast, falling harder
Falling faster in all of the
Chains that bind us
Seeking out our departure
Seeking out our heavenly future
Calling out, call protection
Calling out, calling out to
The hand that blinds us
Make it count, make it out
I make it count, make it out this danger

Poison paradigm
We are savages giving you poison lips
Walking miles, get obsessed
Conflicted calculated architects,
Echo a new directions
Fate loves desire
We are sirens of, of the Apocalypse
Poison paradigm
We are savages giving you poison lips

Welcome, welcome you glory bent
Welcome, welcome to the island
Glory, glory begin again
Glory, glory and betrayal

Falling fast, falling harder
Falling faster in all
Of the chains that bind us
Seeking out our departure
Seeking out our heavenly future
Calling out, call protection
Calling out, calling out
To the hand that blinds us
Make it count, make it out
I make it count, make it out this danger

Poison paradigm
We are savages giving you poison lips
Attitudes, privilege
Without regret, a heaven
Lost at sea, a toxic intuition
Fate loves desire,
We are sirens of, of the Apocalypse
Poison paradigm
We are savages giving your poison lips
Poison paradigm
We are savages giving your poison lips
Poison paradigm
We are savages, we are savages
