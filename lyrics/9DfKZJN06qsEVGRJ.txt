Don't want your body
Don't like your friends
She don't give a damn about your future plans
Don't like your mother
Don't like your taste
Don't even like the look of your pretty face
Your favorite t-shirt
Your favorite dress
All your favorite memories lying in the trash
Don't want your baby
Don't want your love
She just wants your money, honey, open up

Open up
Open your eyes, my love
She's not the one for you
Just wants one thing from you
Your money, your money

Don't wanna touch you
Don't treat you right
You just want someone who holds you through the night
Don't want your body
Don't want your love
She just wants your money, honey, open up

Open up
Open your eyes, my love
She's not the one for you
Just wants one thing from you
Your money, your money
Open up
Open your eyes, my love
She's not the one for you
Just wants one thing from you
Your money, your money

Open up
Open your eyes, my love
Open up
Open your eyes, my love
Open up (she don't wants your love)
Open your eyes, my love (just wants your money)
Open up (she don't wants your love)
Open your eyes, my love (just wants your money)
(She don't wants your love, she just wants one thing)
(Just wants you money)
(She don't wants your love, she just wants one thing)
