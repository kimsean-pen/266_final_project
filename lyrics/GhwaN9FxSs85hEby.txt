Rest in peace girl, your death is such a shame.
The paper said a bullet got in your way.
But I smell foul play, possible poisoning,
I had to bring you in for questioning.
I went to your grave, dug up your body.
Brought it to my house, where you lay.

So let's play doctor babe, we'll operate today.
Incisions must be made. You could help solve this case, for me.

I headed downtown, to share what I had found.
It's not a suicide, it's a crime.
I have a witness, it's clearly evident,
There had to be someone else present,
After time of death. Poison's in stomach,
How could she pull it if she's dead?

So let's play doctor babe, we'll operate today.
Incisions must be made. You could help solve this case.
We need a scalpel now, under white lights you lay.
We've got to hurry up, before the flesh decays away.

I'll catch the murderer and send him away.
I'll get the evidence from your last day.

Your last day... (your last day...)
Your last day... (your last day...)

So let's play doctor babe, we'll operate today.
Incisions must be made. You could help solve this case.
We need a scalpel now, under white lights you lay.
We've got to hurry up, before the flesh decays away, away.
