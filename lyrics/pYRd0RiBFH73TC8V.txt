Every time I leave you girl
He's the one that's near you girl oh I
even as I drive away
I can hear the words he'll say oh I
I guess I don't need her
it doesn't mean I can't get over her
Where you gonna go without me tonight
Don't you know what that means to me

You were in my dream again
And I could see you kissing him oh girl
Why'd you have to change my mind
Just as I was changing mine oh girl
I wish I'd never met you
It doesn't mean I can't get over you
What you gonna do without me tonight
Girl you know what you do to me
