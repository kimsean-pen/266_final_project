i dream i can't sleep
think i should leave
you can keep the fillings
in my teeth
there's no one to blame
cause this ain't a game
the disease and the cure
are one and the same
if i'm alive or i'm bored
if i'm dead or ignored
you'll be on my mind

i hope you'll agree
we didn't get wasted for free
cause if you believe
it's harder to see
the whole's the best part
of siamese hearts
forever in debt
forever disarmed
we'll bloom till we're young
till i'm on your mind
cause

you look like summer
wouldn't dare
to survive you
and i can't stand any colour
i can black out
that's what we're used to

since i'm nowhere
i've never felt more out of place
i'll burn my tongue
till i forget your taste
and the future might bring
the most beautiful past
when tomorrow's sunk
into my world of glass
nearly hoped
nearly home
