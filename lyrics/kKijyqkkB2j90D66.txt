I've been losin' sleep
I've been keepin' myself awake
I've been wandering the streets
For days and days and days

Oh if I'm road to road
Bed to bed
Lover to lover
And black to red

But I believe
I believe

There's no salvation for me now
No space among the clouds
And I've seen that I'm heading down
But that's alright
That's alright
That's alright
That's alright!

And I've been taking chances
I've been setting myself up for the fall
I've been keeping secrets
From my heart and from my soul

Going from road to road
Bed to bed
Lover to lover
And black to red

But I believe
I believe

There's no salvation for me now
No space among the clouds
And I've seen that I'm heading down
But that's alright

That's alright
That's alright
That's alright!

Road to road
Bed to bed
And lover to lover
And black to red

And road to road
Bed to bed
And lover to lover

No space among the clouds
And I feel I'm heading down
But that's alright
That's alright
That's alright
That's alright
That's alright
That's alright!

Road to road
Bed to bed
And lover to lover
And black to red

And road to road
Bed to bed
Lover to lover
To lover to lover
To lover to lover
To lover to lover
To lover to lover
To lover to lover

No salvation for me now
No salvation for me now
No salvation for me now
No salvation for me now
