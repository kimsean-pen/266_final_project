We like to wander into the violets
It feels like nothing and we're already late
I'll never be here
Enter the quietness
It feels like nothing and we're already late

You're always so smilin and no days spent paranoid
She helped me figure it out cause baby's livin in the void
I'll keep on trying and I'll promise to enjoy
You helped me figure it out cause baby's livin in the void
