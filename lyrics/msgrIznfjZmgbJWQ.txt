I wonder if you saw that I was sorry for the beating of my heart
When it woke you in the car park
And maybe I should tell you
That I've villainised by body for too long
Would it help you find excuses to move on?
Like I needed more excuses to be stronger

I'm no mother
But I've done a lot
To prove to those I love that they are good enough
I don't believe in luck so I am giving up

I hope to find a reason for my fear of feelings leaving at the start
It makes my sleeping harder
I don't know much about you
So I'm trying not to doubt you, but in time
I know you'll let me down and that is fine
A feeling I can't shake, it's getting stronger

I'm no mother
But I've done a lot
To prove to those I love that they are good enough
I don't believe in luck
I don't believe in much
Leave it all to trust or start to give it up
