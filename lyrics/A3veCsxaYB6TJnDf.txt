Like a virus needs a body
And soft tissue feeds on blood
Someday I'll find you
The urge is here

Like a mushroom on a tree trunk
As a protein transmutates

I knock on your skin
And I am in

The perfect match, you and I
I enter, contagious

You open up, saying welcome
Like a flame that seeks explosives

As gun powder needs a war
I feast inside you
My host is you
The perfect match, you and I
You fail to resist
My crystalline charm
Like a virus, patient hunter
I'm waiting for you
I'm starving for you
My sweet adversary
My sweet adversary
My sweet adversary
