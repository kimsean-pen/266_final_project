Our love is alive
And so we begin
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table
Stumblin' in

Our love is a flame
Burning within
Now and then firelight will catch us
Stumblin' in

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
You know these reckless thoughts of mine are following you
I'm falling for you
Whatever you do
'Cause baby you've shown me so many things that I never knew
Whatever it takes
Baby I'll do it for you

Our love is alive
And so we begin
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table
Stumblin' in

Our love is a flame
Burning within
Now and then firelight will catch us
Stumblin' in

You were so young
And I was so free
I may have been young, but baby that's not what I wanted to be
Well you were the one
Oh, why was it me?
'Cause baby you've shown me so many things that I've never seen
Whatever you need
Baby you got it from me

Our love is alive
And so we begin
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table
Stumblin' in

Our love is a flame
Burning within
Now and then firelight will catch us
Stumblin' in

Stumblin' in
Stumblin' in
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table
Stumblin' in

Aah, stumblin' in
Mmm, stumblin' in
Now and then firelight will catch us
Stumblin' in

Oh stumblin' in
I'm stumblin' in
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table
Stumblin' in

Whoa, stumblin' in
Aah, stumblin' in
I'm stumblin' in
Keep on stumblin' in
Now and then firelight will catch us
