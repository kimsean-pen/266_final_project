Woah, woah

Come down from the mountain, you have been gone too long
The spring is upon us, follow my only song
Settle down with me by the fire of my yearning
You should come back home, back on your own now

Woah

The world is alive now, in and outside I know
You run through the forest, settle before the sun
Darling, I can barely remember you beside me
You should come back home, back on your own now

Woah
You should come back home, back on your own now

And in the evening light, when the woman of the woods came by
To give to you the word of the old man
In the morning tide when the sparrow and the seagull fly
And Jonathan and Evelyn get tired

Lie to me if you will
At the top of Beringer Hill
Tell me anything you want, any old lie will do
Call me back to, back to you

Lie to me if you will
At the top of Beringer Hill
Tell me anything you want, any old lie will do
Call me back to, back to you
