When you call she doesn't answer
When you write she doesn't answer
You go out you see him with her
She told you she was sick at home

Her ring you gave her
Thrown away with all the letters
And when you see him with her
He doesn't even care at all

And she follows him around like you follow her around
And he doesn't even care and you figure it out
The only way you're gonna keep somebody around
Well I'm about to let you know

There's something I don't wanna understand
The only way a woman's gonna want a man
The only way you'll ever keep her in your hands
Is breaking apart her heart
Don't tell her she's the reason that you live
Don't give her everything that you've got to give
If you wanna keep the girl for as long as you live
Just Break it Apart her Heart

Can't you see the way she's crying
Well that's what keeps her trying
She knew that she could have you
And he don't give her what she wants

There's truth about this
You say you wanna be noticed
Well if you wanna be noticed
You gotta learn to break some hearts

Don't try to understand

There's something I don't wanna understand
The only way a woman's gonna want a man
The only way you'll ever keep her in your hands
Is breaking apart her heart
Don't tell her she's the reason that you live
Don't give her everything that you've got to give
If you wanna keep the girl for as long as you live
Just Break it Apart her Heart

Can you see
What you've done
What I've become
What I've become
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

I don't understand this cruelty
I don't understand but now i see

There's something I don't wanna understand
The only way a woman's gonna want a man
The only way you'll ever keep her in your hands
Is breaking apart her heart
Don't tell her she's the reason that you live
Don't give her everything that you've got to give
If you wanna keep the girl for as long as you live
Just Break it Apart her Heart
I don't understand this cruelty
I don't understand it's just not me
I don't understand this cruelty
But now I see
