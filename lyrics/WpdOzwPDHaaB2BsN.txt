Maybe
You don't have to smile so sad
Laugh when you're feeling bad
I promise I won't, chase you
You don't have to dance so blue
You don't have to say "I do"
When baby you don't

Just tell me
The one thing you never told me
Then let go of me
Hell, just throw me

Maybe if you wanna go home
Tell me if I'm back on my own
Giving back a heart that's on loan
Just tell me if you wanna go home

Oh maybe
You don't have to kill so kind
Pretend to ease my mind
When baby you won't
Oh sugar, you don't have to be so sweet
I know who you're going to meet
Don't say that I don't

So maybe
I won't let your memory haunt me
I'll be sleep walking with the lonely

If you're taking me home
Tell me if I'm back on my own
Giving back a heart that's on loan
Just tell me if you wanna go home
Tell me if you wanna go home
(Cause I'm just not sure)
Tell me if I'm back on my own
(How to get back there)
Giving back a heart that's on loan
(And I just can't bear)
Tell me if you wanna go home
(If you're not there)

(Baby!)
If you're taking me home
Tell me if I'm back on my own
Giving back a heart that's on loan
Tell me if you wanna go
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go, wanna

Cause I'm just not sure
How to get back there
And I just can't bear
If you're not there
Tell me if you wanna go home
(Cause I'm just not sure)
Tell me if I'm back on my own
(How to get back there)
Giving back a heart that's on loan
(And I just can't bear)

Just tell me if you wanna go
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go, wanna
Wanna go, wanna
Wanna go, wanna
