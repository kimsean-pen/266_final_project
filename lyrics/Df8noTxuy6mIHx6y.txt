I know I'm slow, I've been told
Things change I'm still young
I see the same
Nothing's been done
Don't be ashamed
I breathe through your lungs
I breathe through your lungs
I know I'm weird, I've been told
New fears they get old too
They'll get old soon
Like thinking of you
Like breathing for two
Like pushing through
Like headaches do
Oh where did I go wrong
Oh where did I go wrong
I can't think straight
I can't eat babe
I can't stay awake
I love too much
To hurt this bad
Oh, and I have too much
To be this sad
Soak me all up
'Til I can't feel nothing at all
I don't mind
I dreamt last night you were mouthing my name
Under blue skies
