Lovers
Give a little kiss and turn off the lights

Lovers
Give a little kiss before you fade away
One more bottle of red, red wine
She never kisses me that way
One more bottle, I loose my mind
One more time, one less time
I beg my lover,
give a little kiss and turn off the lights
I beg my lover,
give a little kiss before you fade away
One more bottle of red, red wine
She never caresses me that way
One more bottle, I loose my mind
One more time, one less time

I beg my lover,
give a little kiss and fade away
You, my lover
Give a little kiss and turn of the lights
