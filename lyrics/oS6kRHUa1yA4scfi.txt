It's a crime you let it happen to me
Never mind, I'll let it happen to you
I don't mind, forget it there's nothing to lose
But my mind and all the things I wanted
Every time I get it throw it away
It's a sign, I get it, I wanna stay
By the time I lose it I'm not afraid
I'm alive but I can surely fake it

How can I believe when this cloud hangs over me
You're the part of me that I don't wanna see

(Forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it)
(Forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it)

There's a place I see you following me
Just a taste of all that might come to be
I'm alone but holding breath you can breathe
To question every answer counted

Just fade away
Please let me stay
Caught in your way
(Forget it, forget it, forget it...)
Just fade away
Please let me stay
Caught in your way (forget it...)

It's a crime you let it happen to me
I don't mind, I love it, easy to please
Never mind, forget it, just memory
On a page inside a spiral notebook

Just fade away
Please let me stay
Caught in your way
I can live forever here
Just fade away
Please let me stay
Caught in your way
I can live forever here

How can I believe when this cloud hangs over me
You're a part of me that I don't wanna see
I can live forever here
