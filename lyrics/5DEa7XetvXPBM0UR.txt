Now I've Got Nothing To Look At
And I've Got No Pain To Deny
And I've Got No Body To Bleed For
And I've Got No Sun To Pull Down From The Sky
But I'm Saved, Yeah I'm Saved
And I Don't Understand It, I'm Saved
If Mercy Were To Hold Me Closely
And Hide Me In Her Place Of No Pain
The Angels Would Throw Down The Water
They Cried From One Hundred Million Eyes
And I Have A Feeling That's Growing
Somewhere Behind My Sleeping Mind
Yeah I'm Saved, I'm Saved
Yeah I Don't Know Why, But I'm Saved

When Sunlight Falls On Your Shoulder
You Look Like A Creature From Heaven
You're Holy When You Open Your Eyes
And Look Up Inside That Sheltering Sky
And You're An Angel, I'll Never Betray You
But I'll Always Be A Lonely Child
Yeah Still I'm Saved
I'm Saved
Yeah I Don't Deserve It
But I'm Saved
