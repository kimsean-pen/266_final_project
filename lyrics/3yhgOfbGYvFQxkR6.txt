Your smile's giving me
All that you know
I'm your design
Voices explode in the dark
Don't shoot the messenger
It's not our fault
Your words weighting me down
Smother me
I'm your design
Do you know
I'd take the empty road?
But it's too dangerous to explore
Is your world
Much safer than before
Because I don't feel whole?
Destroy entire worlds
Destroy entire worlds
Enter into the sound
I'll behave for you
Casting fear into doubt
I was made for you
Apathetic, Interaction
Another distraction
A Lack of compassion
For the weak you don't see
Hopelessly I
Can you see the flood?
Can you feel the urgency?
Can you see the sunset
behind the willow tree?
Apathetic, Interaction
Another distraction
A Lack of compassion
For the weak you don't see
