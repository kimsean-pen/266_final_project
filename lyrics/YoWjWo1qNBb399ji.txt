there comes a time
when we heed certain call
when the world
must come together as une
there are people dying
And its time to lend a hand to life

There greatest gift of all
We cant go on pretending day by day
That someone, somewhere will soon make a change
We are all a part of God's great big family
And the truth, you know,
Love is all we need

We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So lets start giving
Theres a choice we're making
We're saving out own lives
Its true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

Send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stones to bread
So we all must lend a helping hand
We are the world, we are the children

We are the ones who make a brighter day
So lets start giving
Theres a choice we're making
We're saving out own lives
Its true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
When you're down and out, there seems no hope at all

But if you just believe theres no way we can fall
Let us realize that a change can only come
When we stand together as one
We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So lets start giving
Theres a choice we're making
We're saving out own lives
Its true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
