It's gonna get harder from here
We've gotta get smarter
To make it out alive
Cause you say stop and we say go
Don't wanna be your
Tenth caller on the radio
So don't bother cutting me off short tonight
We let our words speak for themselves
Don't take it all so far
Don't make it that much harder
Than it already is for you to stand alone
For you...

To wake up knowing you've got the day
To take on without feeling okay
To make yourself unwilling to sleep away
(Sleep away the pain)
Don't take off running without my say
Don't pay that price
You thought you'd pay
You've got the choice You've got the time of day

Just don't sleep away the pain

Hold on tight to the things you're given
The camera caught it all
Aren't we all forgiven now?
Cause you say stop and we say go
The world outside is calling
On the telephone
They need answers
So we'll let them know
Tonight, we let our words
Speak for themselves
But maybe I'm not right
We're so damaged by the sunlight
Can we make it through together
Cause honey

I don't like this kind of weather
When i'm with you...

To wake up knowing you've got the day
To take on without feeling okay
To make yourself unwilling to sleep away
(Sleep away the pain)
Don't take off running without my say
Don't pay that price
You thought you'd pay

You've got the choice
You've got the time of day
Just don't sleep away the pain

It's gonna get harder from here
We've gotta get smarter
To get this all in line
Cause you say stop and we say go

To wake up knowing you've got the day
To take on without feeling okay
To make yourself unwilling to sleep away
(Sleep away the pain)
Don't take off running without my say
Don't pay that price
You thought you'd pay
You've got the choice
You've got the time of day
Just don't slip away the pain
