I'm standing on my knees
Life's passing by but no one sees
and there is nothing I can do

You take it all from me, don't want to die
but nothing to give in, sleepwalk away
Leave it all behind

You talk too much and make no sense but in the end,
what's going to change, it's time to grow it's time to go

Won't you come around? This is driving me down and I'm dying
I've got so much more to say to you

Take my hand and never leave though I am terrible
I'm running out of time, throw it all away

You talk too much and make no sense but in the end,
what's going to change, it's time to grow it's time to go

You take it all from me, don't want to die
but nothing to give in, sleepwalk away

I'm standing on my knees
Life's passing by but no one sees

Won't you come around? This is driving me down and I'm dying
