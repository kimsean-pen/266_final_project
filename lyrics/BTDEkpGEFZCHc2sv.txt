I know you need a little road to run
(I will forever remember everyday)
I see you looking where they ain't
Got none (I will never let it get away)
You took your dead to the house of
Plenty and you laid it at their feet
Don't waste your breath on the walk
Of the many while you wait for the mercy

Live long and don't forget
The stone around your neck
I understand you're abnormal to me
Isolation is a two way street

I need to know is it enough to go on
(Baby tell me what you wanna be)
I lie awake at night and talk to no one
(That's the reality)
You put your faith in the count of money
To produce their own receipt
What has the prick of conscience
Done to the use of guillotine

Live long and don't forget
The stone around your neck
I understand you're abnormal to me
Isolation is a two way street
