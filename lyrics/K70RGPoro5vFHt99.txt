Did you ever hear the one
About that bird-girl who went to seed
She took off from the rooftops and landed next to me
Said she'd seen it all
That greed in flames
Laughs
She wants to do it again
Now she's gone to ground
I guess she's sticking around
Where she can't be found
She can't be found
She's kinda sound
