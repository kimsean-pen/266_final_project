Devil in me
I only feel alive when I hurt you
Your misery
I cherish the moments you die inside

I suggest you run and hide

I'll fucking hurt you
I wanna kill you

Meet the devil in me
Do you like what you see?

And if I'm back on the streets, it's not sweat, I'm relieved
My whole life I've been bent on revenge
I'll put you in the same grave as your friends
Ask anybody, I'm as real as it gets
Bitch

I'll fucking hurt you
I wanna kill you

Meet the devil in me
Do you like what you see?
Meet the devil in me
Do you like what you see?
