It's ok, allow yourself a little hate
Hatred is not so bad when directed at injustice
You can turn the other cheek, just don't turn the other way

Enemy of the planet we finally have a common aim
a reason to forget about our differences
and stand as a united front

It's up to us, we must expose,
Humiliate American errorists
We'll start with one
The war has just begun

The war has just begun!
