And if you die, I'll catch you later
Same old shit, same old haters
I know you're mad about the Misfits guy in
your refrigerator Ah Ah, Ah Ah, Ah Ah... Ah Ah...

And if you die, I'll catch you later
Same old shit, same old haters
I know you're mad about the Misfits guy in your refrigerator
Ah Ah, Ah Ah, Ah Ah... Ah Ah...

Yas queen
We can make some pasta and drink a lot of beers
Someday I'll know that you were always there for me
Maybe I just need to keep my heart clean

You know you can do it all
Cause you said to me to be
You said to me to be
You said to me to be

Yas queen
We can make some pasta and drink a lot of beers
Someday I'll know that you were always there for me
Maybe I just need to keep my heart clean
