I dreamt of being a woman
No longer on my last leg
I dreamt of being a woman
I seen myself just like you
It always brings me down
I laid my lover, I regret
I'm still the man in your bed
I dreamed of running out tomorrow
My shoes still longer grow wet
I dreamt of being a woman
I dreamt of being like you
Wonder can't I understand
She knows who just I am
I laid my lover, I regret
Im still the man in your bed
And you can take it all away
Cuz I'm still a man today
