Time, not having an easy time
Never gonna have an easy time
Given the run around to me

Time, a changing, a wasting
Come and get up in my face again, yes
Time, given the run around to me
And I'm not having an easy time

Never having an easy
You know this time, it has never gone easy
Time, never having an easy
You'll never meet another like me

And I'm not having an easy time

Never having an easy
You know this time, it has never gone easy
Time, never having an easy
