There's no one living beyond the hands of fate
A number to get hung on that random way

Her light may never shine on your filthy wall
Degree of what you would want will have to fall
Oh don't we all

Weather will remain the same
If it's painted on your eyelids, high when you decide
Your weather will remain

Weather will remain the same
If it's painted on your eyelids, high when you decide
Your weather will remain the same
If it's painted on your eyelids, high when i decided
Why can't you?

Your light may ever shine on
Forgive, forget and roll on
Our light may ever shine on
Forgive, forget and roll on
