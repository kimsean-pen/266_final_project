Haha!
Dance Gavin Dance baby!
Downtown Battle Mountain Two!

First it's the casting call, but I'm playing basketball
My wife she notifies that I missed a call on my phone
Now why are you snooping, when you should be cooking?
If you read my texts one more time!

If you fill the pageant bowl, I will be masterful
Well full of liquid comedy, namaste, your baller bag is on its way
Red full of lexicons, polishing megatron
If you beat the hoe, you tell your bros, I need this yo!

Stop and don't panic, I've got a plan
Let's both pretend you didn't take that one night stand, oh

So hide your face, collect your things
This is what we call the walk of shame
Oh, pretty lady, I know the cost at the gate, you're almost there

Next it's the pinnacle of me being cynical
Can I be the lynch pin compelling to judge a lottery?
Baggy and awfully, bumpy and blistery
Brutally homeless and fluffy

Hey there, pretty girl, I'm already in your head (So nice, so nice to meet you)
Hey there, pretty girl, I'm already in (So nice, so nice to meet, so nice, so nice to meet you)
Hey there, pretty girl, don't hide what's inside (So nice, so nice to meet you)
Hey there, pretty girl, don't hide what's inside (So nice, so nice to meet, so nice, so nice to meet you)

Lift your head for the last time
Lift it higher and higher and high
How can you love what you can't see?
How can you love what you can't touch?
How can you love what you can't see?
How can you love what you can't touch?
How can you love what you can't see?
How can you love what you can't touch?

Hey there, pretty girl, I'm already in your head (So nice, so nice to meet you)
Hey there, pretty girl, I'm already in (So nice, so nice to meet, so nice, so nice to meet you)
Hey there, pretty girl, don't hide what's inside (So nice, so nice to meet you)
Hey there, pretty girl, don't hide what's inside (So nice, so nice to meet, so nice, so nice to meet you)
