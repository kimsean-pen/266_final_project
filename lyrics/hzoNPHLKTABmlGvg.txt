There's yelling in the hallway
I found refuge on a twin bed
Of this three-star hotel
I hear the laughter from the TV
Static, Rachel talks to Phoebe
About the cat that smells
And I know this place is haunted, oh
I swear I hear somebody knocking
But I can't really tell

And this outlet's busted
Phone died, and I can't charge it
What a life, man, what a life this is, mmm

Just me, myself, and nothing
But I taught me how to love it
Home is wherever I live

Ah, ah, ah ah
Ah, ah, ah ah

I remember I owe mom a call
As I hang my stray hairs on the
Shower walls for decoration
I wonder what I'd hear if rooms could talk
And I wonder why I'm thinking that at all
I'm going crazy

And this toilet's rusted
Food came, but I don't trust it
What a life, man, what a life this is, yeah

Just me, myself and nothing
But I taught me how to love it
Home is wherever I live

Ah, ah, ah ah
Ah, ah, ah ah

Hard to sleep sometimes
With no one by my side
I do my best to find the sense in it
The more the days go by
The more myself and I
Shake hands and realize the
Benefits of independence

And it's really something
To make homes of worn-out luggage
What a life, man, what a life this is, yeah

Just me, myself and nothing
But somehow I've learned to love it
Home is wherever I live

Ah, ah, ah ah
Home is wherever I live
Ah, ah, ah ah
Home is wherever I live
