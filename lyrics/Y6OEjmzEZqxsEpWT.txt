I saw love die in the fire in you
I saw the love being crushed a thousand feet below
I saw the rage rising in the morning sky
I saw the violence in each tear the families cried

Violence
Bring it to me, or I will bring in the end of creation
Bring it to me, violence
Or I will bring in the death of your nation
Bring it to me, violence
Or I will bring in the end of creation
Bring it to me, violence
Or I will bring in the death of this world that we live in

I saw love die in the fire in you
I saw the love being crushed a thousand feet below
I saw the rage rising in the morning sky
I saw the violence in each tear the families cried
Violence
Bring it to me, or I will bring in the end of creation
Bring it to me, violence
Or I will bring in the death of your nation
Bring it to me, violence
Or I will bring in the end of creation
Bring it to me, violence
Or I will bring in the death of this world that we live in

Violence
Bring it to me
