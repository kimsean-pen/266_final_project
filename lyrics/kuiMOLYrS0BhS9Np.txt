Go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on

I've been doing this my way, your way, our way
I can't make it work
When all I have is not enough
I've been doing all I can, my plan, your plan
And all I get is hurt
This game we're playing has to stop

I got you stuck in my head
And all you do is breaking me
I can't continue taking this
I tried my best to understand
But I cannot make sense of you
I've got to take a stand now baby

I don't want to waste another day
I don't want to live my life this way
I'm tired
I just want to lie back down and
I don't want to waste another night
I don't want to keep on chasing lights
So go on, go on, go on,
Go on, go on, go on
Bye Bye

I remember I met you
Let you get your way in everything
You took complete control of me
I remember you lying
Crying, trying to get away with it
But now I know cause now I see

I believed all that you said
I never questioned any lies
I never opened up my eyes
And all your words got me misled
But I am standing
I'm alive
I never had you on my side
Oh

I don't want to waste another day
I don't want to live my life this way
I'm tired
I just want to lie back down and
I don't want to waste another night
I don't want to keep on chasing lights
So go on, go on, go on,
Go on, go on, go on
Bye Bye
Bye Bye
Oh

I've been doing this my way, your way, our way
It doesn't work

I don't want to waste another day
I don't want to live my life this way
I'm tired
I just want to lie back down and
I don't want to waste another night
I don't want to keep on chasing lights
So go on, go on, go on,
Go on, go on, go on
Bye Bye

I don't want to waste another day
I don't want to live my life this way
I'm tired
I just want to lie back down and
I don't want to waste another night
I don't want to keep on chasing lights
So go on, go on, go on,
Go on, go on, go on
Bye Bye

Bye bye

Go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on

Bye bye
