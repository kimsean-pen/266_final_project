Life isn't easy from the singular side
Down in the hole some emotions are hard to hide
It's your decision it's a chance that you take
It's on your head it's a habit that's hard to break
Do you need a friend would you tell no lies
Would you take me in are you lonely in the dark

In the dark
In the dark
In the dark

You never listen to the voices inside
They fill your ears as you run to a place to hide
You're never sure if the illusion is real
You pinch yourself but the mem'ries are all you feel
Can you break away from your alibis
Can you make a play will you meet me in the dark

In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark

Don'tcha need me... hey, hey
Don'tcha need me... oh yea
Don'tcha leave me... hey, hey
Don'tcha need me... oh yea

You take no int'rest no opinion's too dear
You make the rounds and you try to be so sincere
You guard your hopes and you pocket your dreams
You'd trade it all to avoid an unpleasant scene
Can you face the fire when you see me there
Can you feel the fire will you love me in the dark

In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
