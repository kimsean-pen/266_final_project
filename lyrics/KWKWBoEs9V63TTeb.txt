I'm Mr King Dice
I'm the game'st in the land
I never play nice
I'm the devil's right hand man.

I can't let you past
cause you ain't done everything
bring me those contracts
come on bring em' to the king.

If you haven't finished your task
haven't worked assiduously
No I cannot let you past
Don't you mess with me

Heed just what I say
The Devil has his price
And I'll make sure you pay
I don't have time to mess round
And I hope you will agree
Bring me those contracts
