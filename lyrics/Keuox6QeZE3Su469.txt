Every breath is a prayer of some kind
I beathe in, I beathe out, I just breathe
And you're so well, blue wonderful
blue wonderful to me
Like the swimming in your eyes
I dive in, I dive deep, I just swim
And loose myself in you, blue wonderful,
blue wonderful again

Don't you know where you go, I will follow
In your footsteps I find my own feet
Addicted like I am to the blues
The kindest blue of all the blues I need

Yesterday that's someone else's song
The 65, summertime, long ago
long before you came, blue wonderful
blue wonderful I know
Ain't just someting I've just left behind
In the past, far away, used to be
But you're present my blue wonderful
blue wonderful to me

Go where you want when you want to
Just don't let the wind tear you free
Stick around the love that brings you home
Don't ever hang around with the breeze

Don't you know where you go, I will follow
In your footsteps I find my own feet
Addicted like I am to the blues
The kindest blue of all the blues I need

Every breath is a prayer of some kind
I beathe in, I beathe out, I just breathe
And you're so well, blue wonderful
blue wonderful to me
Like the swimming in your eyes
I dive in, I dive deep, I just swim
And loose myself in you, blue wonderful,
blue wonderful again
And loose myself in you, blue wonderful,
blue wonderful
blue wonderful
blue wonderful
blue wonderful
again
