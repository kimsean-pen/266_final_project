Well I've been spending my days with my thumb in the air
People been telling me son well you ain't getting nowhere
I shuffle my feet purely out of despair
And now I'm moving to you this I know my dear

Well I see fields of green dead and yellow too.
Waters bleeding red oh and seas of blue.
I tend to close my eyes and let the wind take me their
Now I'm lost and moving without a care
