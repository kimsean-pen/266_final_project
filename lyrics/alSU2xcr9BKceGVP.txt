I almost died at twenty-one

In January, driving northbound on Abbott Rd
the car in front of us slammed their brakes down hard
and slid off onto the right-hand shoulder

We were probably following too close,
but I honestly can't remember

We swerved into the turn lane
and lost control when we hit a patch of black ice
that would carry us right into the unavoidable path
of a Saturn barreling south in the opposite direction

My life did not flash before my eyes

I was trying to steer the van anywhere else
as time ground to a halt and froze

Then exploded violently
as metal collapsed into metal
at a horrific speed

There is always enough time to do the things you love
(until it's gone)
