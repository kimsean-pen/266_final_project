I'm sick of all this waiting
And people telling me
What I should be
What if I'm not so crazy?
Maybe you're the one who's wrong
Not me

So what you gonna do
What you gonna say
When we're standing on top
And do it our way?
You say we got no future
You're living in the past
So listen up
That's my generation

(Hey ho, let's go)
It's going down tonight
(Hey ho, let's go)
We're gonna do it till we die
(Hey ho, let's go)
'Cause I, I, I've got no reason to apologize
That's my generation

I don't need to say I'm sorry
I do what everybody wants to do
It's not so complicated
'Cause I know you want the same thing too

So what you gonna do
What you gonna say
When we're standing on top
And do it our way?
You say we got no future
You're living in the past
So listen up
That's my generation

(Hey ho, let's go)
It's going down tonight
(Hey ho, let's go)
We're gonna do it till we die
(Hey ho, let's go)
'Cause I, I, I've got no reason to apologize
That's my generation

Listen

Don't need to say I'm sorry
It's not so complicated
'Cause I know you want the same thing too

(Hey ho, let's go)
It's going down tonight
(Hey ho, let's go)
We're gonna do it till we die
(Hey ho, let's go)
'Cause I, I, I've got no reason to apologize
That's my generation

(Hey ho, let's go)
That's my generation
(Hey ho, let's go)
We're gonna do it till we die
(Hey ho, let's go)
'Cause I, I, I've got no reason to apologize
That's my generation
