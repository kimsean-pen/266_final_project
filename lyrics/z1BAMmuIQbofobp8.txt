Black was the night that followed me home in the rain
Dark was the light that left me alone in the day
And now it'll never stop the raining
And they say turn away
Get fisted
I can't wait for the feeling today
The left of my side took all the power away
The right in my eye holding the feeling of day
And now it'll never stop the raining
And I'll say turn away
Get fisted
I can't wait for the feeling today
Get fisted
Oh tonite
Get fisted
All Right
