She's gone out of the way,
To keep him a place in time
He's holding on with the grip of the titan
When she is made up her mind
She's gone, it's a shame
He couldn't convinced her to stay
I told your name of a crowd full of strangers
I saw you with my own aim

The look in your eyes has been sometimes
And I tried to move you, but I'm stuck to the ground
I didn't mean to be hanging around
I didn't think that I was getting you down

We tried to get ourselves together
We built a fire, we just couldn't handle the flames
Spent the night in search for something better
We cried, but that's no way to handle the AFFAIRS
But that's no way to handle the AFFAIRS

Take me back in your arms,
I'm dying to feel your embrace
He's holding on by the tips of his fingers
She says she needs more space
Take me back to the days
When at least the violence was good
My mind is racing and my heart's on fire
She's loving somebody new

We tried to get ourselves together
We built a fire, we just couldn't handle the flames
Spent the night in search for something better
We cried, but that's no way to handle the AFFAIRS
But that's no way to handle the AFFAIRS
