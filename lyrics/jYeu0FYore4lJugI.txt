Remembering me
Discover and see
All over the world
She's known as a girl

To those who are free
The mind shall be key
Forgotten as the past
'Cause history will last...

God is a girl
Wherever you are
Do you believe it?
Can you receive it?

God is a girl
Whatever you say
Do you believe it?
Can you receive it?

God is a girl
However you live
Do you believe it?
Can you receive it?

God is a girl
She's only a girl
Do you believe it?
Can you receive it?

She wants to shine
Forever in time
She is so driven
She's always mine

Clearly and free
She wanted to be
A part of the future
A girl like me...

There's a sky, illuminating us
Someone is out there
That we truly trust

There is a rainbow
For you and me
A beautifull sunrise
Eternally...

God is a girl
Wherever you are
Do you believe it?
Can you receive it?

God is a girl
Whatever you say
Do you believe it?
Can you receive it?

God is a girl
However you live
Do you believe it?
Can you receive it?

God is a girl
She's only a girl
Do you believe it?
Can you receive it?
