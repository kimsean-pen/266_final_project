i got something on my mind
makes me sad and makes my cry - oh no
johnny wanna live

just an ordinary day
an animal will pass away - oh no
johnny wanna live

who's to say he got no rights
even not a right to life
don't know why it leaves you cold
don't know how to make it show - oh no
johnny wanna live
johnny wanna live

got to give his skin away
for coats they wear on summerdays - oh no
johnny wanna live

beauty aid and all the rest
come directly from a test - oh no
johnny wanna live

through his eyes i look inside his heart
he can feel like me and you
can't defend himself cause he can't talk
and this is why i talk you

johnny isn't just a name
he stands for every creature's pain - oh no
johnny wanna live
johnny wanna live

go and try to look inside his heart
you can find your own mistakes
try to hide them thinking he can't talk
but he can read them in your face

i got something on my mind
it makes me sad
and it makes me cry - oh no
let him live

tell me why it leaves you cold
i swear
i'm gonna make it show - oh no
johnny wanna live
johnny wanna live
