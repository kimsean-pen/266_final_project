Oh let me sink into this blip of joy
I can't believe this is happening to me
It took so long to reach this mountain top
With just one kiss I forget I hate myself

It's just a little blip of joy
Can I feel it again

Surviving off this moment
So close to you
The grass is wet and for once
My heart is free
It took so long to reach this mountain top
With just one kiss I forget I hate myself

It's just a little blip of joy
Can I feel it again

I'm scared to ask what your middle name is
'Cuz that might be going too far
Gotta let this remain mysterious
'Cuz you're a wild dove
And I know you'll fly far
And I'll never see you again
But tonight my heart is singing
It's singing
It's singing
But tonight my heart is singing
It's singing

It's just a little blip of joy
Can I feel it again
It's just a little blip of joy
Can I feel it again
It's just a little blip of joy
Can I feel it again
It's just a little blip of joy
