I'm coming down with a heartache tonight
Only you can make it right
If I can't be with you holding you tight
There won't be no morning light

Every where I turn
I see your face
Reminding me of a higher place
Every time you smile
Angels cry
Every time you Walk On By

I'm not the only
Feeling lonely
Every time you Walk On By
I try to say something
But end up with nothing
Every time you Walk On By
(Every time you Walk On By)

I keep my cool I pretend I'm not here
Every time you come too near
I'm such a fool 'cause, this love is true and
If I don't tell you someone else surely will

Every where I turn
I see your face
Reminding me of a higher place
Every time you smile
Angels cry
Every time you Walk On By

I'm not the only
Feeling lonely
Every time you Walk On By
I try to say something
But end up with nothing
Every time you Walk On By
(Feeling lonely)

If I ever see you again
This craziness must find an end
I look at you
And I promise myself

I'm not the only
Feeling lonely
Every time you Walk On By
I try to say something
But end up with nothing
Every time you Walk On By

I'm not the only
Feeling lonely
Every time you Walk On By
I try to say something
But end up with nothing
Every time you Walk On By
Every time you Walk On By
Every time you Walk On By
