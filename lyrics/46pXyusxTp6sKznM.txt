Fire in the house
Burn that son of a
Whoo
I'ma shut this down
Kitty kat, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow
Hit it with the he, to the he to the how
Miss Jackson, oh she wear the crown
Brand new sound, got a brand new style
Coming with the banger like Boom Boom Pow
Wow
Yooh, ooh, ooh, child
Janet Jackson come soon the young town

We can' bang right now I'm right here
Lately I've been on, on a mission yeah
That I may never get another move in the air
Yeah
So tell me what you wanna do?
But don't do nothin' stupid
What is happening in front of you
All it is is love in the booth
When the DJ play this beat
We gon' dance like no one's watching
Hey Mr DJ bump the track
And won't you turn it up
I'ma dance all night and I don't care
Who's out there watching us
Just give me that fire
I'ma show you how to burn it up
Hurt your body, burn it up more
Burn it up and burn it up more
Hurt your body, burn it up more
That's how I burn it up
Ain't no sittin' down, gotta keep it up
Me and Missy got the whole room jumpin' up (that's right)
It's that motion from the second it drop
We get ahead with the beat is so hot, hot
So tell me what you wanna do?
But don't do nothin' stupid
What is happening in front of you
All it is is love in the booth
Here we go
When the DJ play this beat
We gon' dance like no one's watching
Hey Mr DJ bump the track
And won't you turn it up
I'ma dance all night and I don't care

I'ma show you how to burn it up
When the DJ play this beat
We gon' dance like no one's watching
Hey Mr DJ bump the track
And won't you turn it up
