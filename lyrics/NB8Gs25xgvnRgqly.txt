i had a quick lunch, then i drove off
it was a very bizarre departure from your house
the weather was beautiful
i stopped to call you and you said yes
you were nevertheless optimistic of our love,
but

when you're not around me, i get blue
i can't begin describing it to you, no
i feel a kind of invisible pain
without you there's no reasonable gain
norway norway norway

i've begun to dwell in misery
if only it was you that i could see, though
i feel a kind of unthinkable fear
there's no desire to live without you here
norway norway norway

i'm eating breakfast all by myself
it is a typically bland existence without you
filling the coffee cup
