You're putting me down again
But it doesn't sound sincere
I'm hitting the ground again
And it seems you've put me here
I know you've been hurt a lot
And the pain lasts to this day
I think you made a wall to protect
But its pushing me away

These Scars seem to guard your fragile broken heart
With each wound you grew stronger
A layer of armor
A shield, that keeps me out

But do you wanna be alone?
Do you really wanna be alone?
Do you wanna be alone?

I'm trying to look past the slits
And the mere little tricks up your sleeve
I'm jumping the hurdles you set
And I'm wanting to believe
Maybe you've been hurt so bad
That you can't except my love
When it comes to trusting again
Haven't you waited enough?

These Scars seem to guard your fragile broken heart
With each wound you grew stronger
A layer of armor
A shield, that keeps me out

These Scars seem to guard your fragile broken heart
With each wound you grew stronger
A layer of armor
A shield, that keeps me out

But do you wanna be alone?

I can't promise that I will do
All the things that you want done
But I will try
And I won't lie
Pick you up when you are down

Are you ready to jolt from that lonely ride
Of never trusting anyone?

These Scars seem to guard your fragile broken heart
With each wound you grew stronger
A layer of armor
A shield, that keeps me out

These Scars seem to guard your fragile broken heart
With each wound you grew stronger
A layer of armor
A shield, that keeps me out

But do you wanna be alone?
Do you really wanna be alone?
Do you wanna be alone?

Do you really wanna
Do you really wanna
Do you really wanna be alone?
Do you really wanna
Do you really wanna
Do you really wanna be alone?

Are you ready to jolt from that lonely ride
Of never trusting anyone?
