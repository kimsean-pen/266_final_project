Curled up like a vine
Trying to find it
A load of old joy lifting me
I'm worse for wear
Down at heel
All you people make me ill
You're not really touching me
Shapeshifting
Cut me out
Twist my arm
I work like a machine
Plaster lace and painted hands
Cut me out
Twist my arm
You hold me in your mind
The wind blows through
Screaming inside
Floating above
Watching the lights
Floating above
Shapeshifting
