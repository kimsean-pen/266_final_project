Burnt all the bridges I have passed
No looking back to the life I once had
-The hate for myself is all that's left now

"As blood runs down my arms
I feel peace in my heart..."

On my skin the razor blade is shining bright
The veins show clearly through, my blood is running wild

This wrath that runs inside my veins
This hate that burns inside the ruins of my heart
I've got to let it out
I can't control it anymore

"As blood runs down my heart
I feel peace in my heart..."

On my skin the razor blade is shining bright
The veins show clearly through, my blood is running wild
The deep red flowing within, longing to be free
A little pressure's all it takes to make me bleed... to death
