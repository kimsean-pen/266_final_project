Faded, we're fading
We ain't breathing lately
No tomorrow, not for you and I
Hate it, I hate it
Can't believe I'm sayin' it
Call my friends and tell 'em we had died

Our love, our love, our love
It is gone now
Our love, our love, our love
Took everything we had
Our love, our love, our love
Was real, I felt that
But it ain't coming back
No, it ain't coming back

I wish you everything you've ever wanted in your life
This tastes so bittersweet, it's like I'm going under
Burn all the letters, all of my secrets, things only you know
Bury my heart six feet under, throw us a funeral
I wish you everything you've ever wanted in your life

Faded, you're faded
Only thing that makes sense
Anything to take the pain away
Complicated, but I wanted us to make it
I was praying, waiting for a change

Our love, our love, our love
It is gone now
Our love, our love, our love
Took everything we had
Our love, our love, our love
Was real, I felt that
But it ain't coming back
No, it ain't coming back

I wish you everything you've ever wanted in your life
This tastes so bittersweet, it's like I'm going under
Burn all the letters, all of my secrets, things only you'd know
Bury my heart six feet under, throw us a funeral
I wish you everything you've ever wanted in your life

Burn all the letters, all of my secrets
Things only you'd know
Bury my heart six feet under, throw us a funeral
Burn all the letters, all of my secrets
Things only you'd know
Bury my heart six feet under, throw us a funeral

I wish you everything you've ever wanted in your life
This tastes so bittersweet, it's like I'm going under
Burn all the letters, all of my secrets, things only you'd know
Bury my heart six feet under, throw us a funeral
I wish you everything you've ever wanted in your life

Say your last, say your last
Say your last goodbye
Say your last, say your last
Say your last goodbye
