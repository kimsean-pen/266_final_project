Day by day,
Let's pave the path to escape.
Pave the way.
Tragic endings passed away.
Bring forth sincerity,
Bring forth the change.
This portrait of dishonesty will be slain.

I will not hold back.
I will not regret.
I won't hold back.
I won't regret.

This place I now call home is nothing more than a fallacy.
Nothing more than a fallacy...
This is not my home...

You got a one way ticket to hell,
With open arms to damnation.
