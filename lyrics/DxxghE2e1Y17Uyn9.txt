Freeze in the stare of the cold, full moon
And burn in the glare of the judging sun
Spill the blood down the serpent's stairs
You'll never be free until you break away

No streets of gold with the Lavey-athan
No pearly gates with the Lavey-athan

Slit the throat of the offering lamb
And hang the thralls from the holy branch
Congregate in the circle of stone
But you're just a piece of shit seen from the holy throne

No streets of gold with the Lavey-athan
No pearly gates with the Lavey-athan

Bow to your genetic needs
Revel in the comfort of a prophecy
Surrender reason for dependency
Nurse at the bosom of divinity

Shrouded in the clouds or in the heavens above
Dwelling in the deep or on a mountain top
Ambiguous writings lead the thousands by the hand
Get your sense of purpose from the clergy man

No streets of gold with the Lavey-athan
No pearly gates with the Lavey-athan.
