Been down in the valley
Smoking natural collie
Getting inspiration
Spreading it through the nation
Spreading it
Cause that's my work
Yes, I'm spreading it
Cause there's nothing else to do

People? look around you
Can't you see we're living in poverty?
This pain is too much for me
Oh Jah, oh Jah, oh Jah
Save the people
Free them from captivity
This pain is too much to be
Oh Jah, oh Jah, oh Jah

In the Jah, Jah Kingdom
You've got to be full of wisdom
Knowledge and overstanding
Giving you my command
Jah commands you
To do his work
And if you don't
You'll raise up stones

People? look around you
Can't you see we're living in poverty?
This pain is too much for me
Oh Jah, oh Jah, oh Jah
Save the people
Free them from captivity
This pain is too much to be
Oh Jah, oh Jah, oh Jah
