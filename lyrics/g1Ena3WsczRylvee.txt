Is anybody out there?
Is anybody listening?
Does anybody really know?
If it's the end of the beginning,
A cry

A rush
From one breathe
Is all we're waiting for
Sometimes the one we were taking
Changes every one before

It's everything you wanted, it's everything you don't
It's one door swinging open and one door swinging closed
Some prayers find an answer
Some prayers never know
We're holding on and letting go
Sometimes we're holding angels

And we never even know
Don't know if we'll make it
But we know
We just can't let it show
It's everything you wanted, it's everything you don't

It's one door swinging open and one door swinging closed
Some prayers find an answer
Some prayers never know
We're holding on and letting go
Yeah, letting go
It's everything you wanted, it's everything you don't
It's one door swinging open and one door swinging closed
Some prayers find an answer
Some prayers never know
We're holding on and letting go
It's everything you wanted, it's everything you don't
It's one door swinging open and one door swinging closed
Some prayers find an answer
Some prayers never know
We're holding on and letting go.
