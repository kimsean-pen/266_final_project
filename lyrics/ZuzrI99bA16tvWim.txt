Take a part of me
the plan slips out of me
I won't be won't be the one
who can never look back and care about you
it's like I'll always be the one you only hear about
Ooooh oh
Ooooh oh
Talk, let it tumble out
I let myself fall down when you're around
I'll race you to the top
You're up ahead
every little thing that they said
has gone away
I'll always grow dark when you're playing games
come on inside can you stay
and play it all away
Cos I can only talk with you
I just wana peep from you
and everything swims around
got both feet on the ground
hoping everything will stop but it's swirling around
all I wana do is change
but I'm so stuck in my ways
and every time I talk I forget
there's this who world outside of my head
sometimes I knock but there's nobody there
Cos I can only talk with you
I just wana peep from you
and everything swims around
got both feet on the ground
hoping everything will stop but it's swirling around
all I wana do is change
but I'm so stuck in my ways
and every time I talk I forget
there's this who world outside of my head
sometimes I knock but there's nobody there
