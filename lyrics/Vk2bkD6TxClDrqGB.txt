It's your life for now
Do what you want with it
Once they're dead and gone
Maybe I'll feel again

Now that you're older,
Where are you going?
Feels like it's over when I start to doubt

Nothing is closer
Goodbye composure
Making it harder when the lights go down

Back and forth I go
Show me the other way
Someday soon I'll know
But now I can only say

What do you want from me?

Now that you're older,
Where are you going?
Making it harder when the lights go down

Nothing is closer
No more composure
Making it harder when the lights go out

What do you want from me?

It's all I can say now
I can't run away now
(What do you want from me?)
I'm trying to grow old but it doesn't look fun

Sometimes I'm lonely
Call out my homie
(What do you want from me?)
The people around me who wanna turn up

Thought I'd never make it out
Then you came and showed me how
All I know is that I found
That things get better when you're around

When you stay back
I let it go
You won't feel alone

Back and forth I go
Show me the other way
One day soon I'll know
But now I can only say

Oh oh oh oh ohhh

(What do you want from me?)

Oh oh ohhh

(What do you want from me?)

That's all I can say now
When I lose my way now
I'm trying to turn up but it doesn't look fun

And sometimes I'm lonely
Call out my homie
The people around me, who wanna wake up

Oh oh ohhh

(What do you want from me?)

Oh oh ohhh

(What do you want from me?)

What do you want from me?
