Full moon make this night
Love will heal the wound
The glowing light
Will set things right, it's alright

Full moon wait in vain
Love for sure, come with rain
Rain for sure will make it right, it's alright

Full moon make this night
Love will heal the wound
Glowing light
Will make things right, it's alright

Full moon wait in vain
Love for sure, come with rain
Rain for sure will make it right, it's alright

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

Dark sky, rinse me with rain and I'll cry
Love tears, blurring my sight, it's alright
Filled up and want to be empty, rinse me, it's alright

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright

Dark sky, rinse me with rain and I'll cry
Love tears, blurring my sight, it's alright
Filled up and want to be empty, rinse me
