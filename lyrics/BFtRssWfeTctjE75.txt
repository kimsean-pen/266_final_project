Data trails, like fingernails
Scratch across, the sky?
Hard to know, figure out
Tell the truth, from lies
Everywhere, listening
Ever word, you say
Think I found, a way around
Ya think I found, a way

Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on

Satellite, I'm watching you
I'm one step, ahead
Satellite, I'm part of you
I'm inside, your head

Yes we can, yes we did
Eliminate, despair
Better watch, what you think
What was that, you said?
Everywhere, and everything
And every word, you say
Think I found, a way out
Think I found, a way

Come on

Satellite, I'm watching you
I'm one step, ahead
Satellite, I'm part of you
I'm inside, your head
Satellite, I'm watching you
I'm one step, ahead
Satellite, I'm part of you
I'm inside, your head

Satellite, I know you're up there somewhere
Satellite, I know you're up there somewhere
Satellite, (so very high)
I know you're up there somewhere
Satellite, (so very high)
I know you're up there somewhere
Satellite, (so very high)
I know you're up there somewhere
Satellite, (so very high)
I know you're up there somewhere
Satellite, (so very high)
I know you're up there somewhere
Satellite, (so very high)
I know you're up there somewhere
So very high
So very high
