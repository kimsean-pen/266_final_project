Cut me off from the rest of the world
It's my addiction
It turns me on

It's oh so quiet my end of the world
Ban all the music
It's all gone wrong

This is, this is it
They're tryn'a take it from me
Got this, this is it
Won't let them take it from me
Play an illegal song
And turn it up louder
Play an illegal song
And turn it up louder

There's a buzz in the air, I've been told
It's my affliction
Been sick so long

Switching off all the noise I've been sold
Ban all the music
It's all gone wrong

This is, this is it
They're tryn'a take it from me
Got this, this is it
Won't let them take it from me
Play an illegal song
And turn it up louder
Play an illegal song
And turn it up louder

This is, this is it
They're tryn'a take it from me
Got this, this is it
Won't let them take it from me
Play an illegal song
And turn it up louder
Play an illegal song
