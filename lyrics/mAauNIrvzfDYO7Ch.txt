Don't turn your back on me
Conceal and protect me
I need you to stop me
From reeling around
The time's gonna come
When you no longer need me
But stay by my side 'til the sun has gone down

When I am an old man
And live by the sea
Will all your thoughts fly to me?

As much as I want you
I can't hold on to you
When will you return to your old home again?
May love lie around you
Good fortunes surround you
You know where to turn to
When you need a friend

When I am an old man
And live by the sea
Will all your thoughts fly to me?

When I am far away from the places we've known
Will all your love bring me home?

When I am an old man
And live by the sea
Will all your thoughts fly to me?
When I am far away from the places we've known
Will all your love bring me home?
Bring me home?
