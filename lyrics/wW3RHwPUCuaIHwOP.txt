I've been talking to myself
Oh, I think I need your help
Oh, this love is make believe
Trapped inside a fantasy

And he came running out of the water
In the dead of the night he could see
As his shadow came towards her
She felt what she wanted to see
She whispered use me

What you touch you believe
It's a dangerous scene
When passion turns into greed

Cruel Sexuality
Am I a fool
To let you trouble me?
Cruel Sexuality

I don't even know myself
'Cause I'm becoming someone else
Where is rationality
When I'm lost inside a dream
I say just use me

When you chose to deceive
It's a dangerous scene
When passion turns into greed

Cruel Sexuality
Am I a fool
To let you trouble me?
Cruel Sexuality
Sexuality

Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me in your prison at night?
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me, why must you keep me

Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me in your prison at night?
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me, why must you keep me

Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me in your prison at night?
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me, why must you keep me

Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me in your prison at night?
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me, why must you keep me

(Cruel Sexuality)
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me in your prison at night?

(Am I a fool
To let you trouble me?)
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me in your prison at night?
