Swollen eyes that bleed for you
Cold steel bars I'm watching thru

You've been baptized in a lake of tears
Crucified yourself with your own fears

But you learn from what's killing you
And this time it's real
Beyond your prayers
Too numb to feel
Beyond your prayers

Deepest darkest thoughts you dream
Curing's harder than it seems
Slave to no one but your misery
Broken man lies where you used to be

Now watch the planets collide
