Do you remember my sister? how many mistakes did she make with those never blinking eyes? I couldn't work it out. I swear she could read your mind, your life, the depths of your soul at one glan
Aybe she was stripping herself away, saying

Here I am, this is me
I am yours and everything about me, everything you see...
If only you look hard enough
I never could.
Our life was a pillow-fight. we'd stand there on the quilt, our hands clenched ready. her with her milky teeth, so late for her age, and a stanley knife in her hand. she sliced the tyres on my b

She went blind at the age of five. we'd stand at the bedroom window and she'd get me to tell her what I saw. I'd describe the houses opposite, the little patch of grass next to the path, the gat

I can see little twinkly stars,
Like christmas tree lights in faraway windows.

Floating around orange and mustard planets.

I can see huge tiger striped fishes

Ad because it didn't hurt. her left hand was pretty good though. we'd have arm wrestling matches, I'd have to use both arms and she'd still beat me.

We buried her when she was 32. me and my aunt, the vicar, and the man who dug the hole. she said she didn't want to be cremated and wanted a cheap coffin so the worms could get to her quickly. s
