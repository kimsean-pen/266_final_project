Until the day you die, you'll always admit
That You were right, you were right
About all those things

Fire eye'd boy give 'em all the slip
Fire eye'd boy give 'em all the slip
If you gonna come you better make it quick
Fire eye'd boy give 'em all the slip

Until the day I die, Columbia I blame
Let us burn, back to life
To do it all again

Fire eye'd boy give 'em all the slip
Fire eye'd boy give 'em all the slip
If you gonna come you better make it quick
Fire eye'd boy gets his as quick

Fire eye'd boy give 'em all the slip
Fire eye'd boy give 'em all the slip
If you gonna come you better make it quick
Fire eye'd boy give 'em all the slip

Fire eye'd boy give 'em all the slip
Fire eye'd boy give 'em all the slip
If you gonna come you better make it quick
Fire eye'd boy gets his as quick
