And he was walking in the garden
And he was walking in the night
And he was singing a sad love song
And he was praying for his life

And the stars came out around him
He was thinking of his sins
And he's looking at his songbird
And he's looking at his wings

There, inside the garden
Came another with his lips
Said, "Won't you come and be my lover?
Let me give you a little kiss"

And he came, knelt down before him
And fell upon his knees
"I will give you golden mountains
If you stay a while with me"

And there was trouble taking place
Trouble taking place

There, inside the garden
They kissed and the sun rose
And he walked a little further
And he found he was alone

And the wind, it gathered 'round him
He was thinking of his sins
And he's looking for his songbird
He was looking for his wings

And there was trouble taking place
Trouble taking place
There was trouble taking place
Trouble taking place
