I've been cursed
I've been crossed
I've been beaten by the ones that get me off
I've been cut

I've been opened up
I've been shattered by the ones I thought I loved
You left me here like a chalk outline
On the sidewalk waiting for the rain

To wash away
Wash away
You keep coming back to the scene of the crime
But the dead can't speak
And there's nothing left to say anyway
All you left behind

Is a chalk outline
I've been cold
In the crypt
But not as cold as the words across your lips
You'll be sorry baby
Someday
When you reach across the bed

Where my body used to lay
You left me here like a chalk outline
On the sidewalk waiting for the rain
To wash away

Wash away
You keep coming back to the scene of the crime
But the dead can't speak
And there's nothing left to say anyway

All you left behind
Is a chalk outline
All you left behind
Is a chalk outline
(All you left behind)
You left me here like a chalk outline

On the sidewalk waiting for the rain
To wash away
Wash away
You keep coming back to the scene of the crime
But the dead can't speak
And there's nothing left to say anyway
All you left behind
Is a chalk outline
