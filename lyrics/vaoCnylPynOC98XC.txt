It's too nice out
Let's play hooky
And get high til we both float away
We won't show today
Doesn't matter what they say
What goes up can stay

If you tell me I'm the one
While we're lying in the sun
Would you sign it on a piece of paper?
Do you know what you're about?
Could we live beyond our doubts
In a world where we don't need erasers?

Could you ever love a thief?
Can I steal away your grief
And suspend your disbelief
Let's put on a show
'Cause it's never what you say
No, it's always in the way
That you say what you mean
Oh oh oh

Wrap your legs around my back
And hold me tight until we're talkin' in tongues
Then when we pass the spirit
We can yell forever at the top of our lungs

Just float
Just float
Just float

It's too nice out
Let's play hooky
And get high til we both float away
We won't show today
Doesn't matter what they say
What goes up can stay

Don't sweat the gooms
All we do is crack a smile
When we hear 'em callin'
"You should go get a room."
Every stop to think the pollen in the air
Is from all the flowers fuckin' each other?
But why not let them bloom?
Let's get consumed
Outside, outside, outside
Inside o' you

So forget me not
We're doin' trust falls
Up at the mountaintop
C'mon, don't let me drop
Now that we've found a spot
And when we swung high on the pendulum
We just hung there in the sky

Just float
Just float
Just float

It's too nice out
Let's play hooky
And get high til we both float away
We won't show today
Doesn't matter what they say
What goes up can stay
