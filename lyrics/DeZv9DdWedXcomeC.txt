Baby I'm sick inside
I'm definitely out of my mind
I know there's something not quite right
Disconnect, system override

You're so brave from your side of the glass
And you, you can't compute, you can't do the math
And you're, you're playing god with your remote control
But I already know that there's a flaw in my code and the
The truth is you silently study me
And there are consequences that you cannot see
And you ask yourself how did I unplug
But the simple truth is that I just don't give a fuck

I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
Baby I don't care
Baby I don't care
Oh I don't care
No I don't
You say you're the cure
But I smell your disease
I've figured you out
Like a rat in a cage

So come in tie me down try and reprogram me
Please run your tests tell me how I am malfunctioning
You cut me up sew me back together one more time
I'm not in sync, data breach can't bring me back online
You start to panic when you realize you try to
Shut me down when you look in my eyes no matter
How you try and rewire me
Or psychoanalyze my psychology

I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
Baby I don't care
Baby I don't care
Oh I don't care
No I don't
You say you're the cure
But I smell your disease
I've figured you out
Like a rat in a cage

You put away all your needles and knives
Tell me do you feel satisfied
Did you get what you came here for
I can tell you still want more

Did you get everything you need
Are you finished watching me bleed
Did you think you could just walk away
Did you think I'd just let you leave

Maybe you didn't think I would know
Maybe you didn't think I would see
Cause I'll never give what you want
I learned the truth a long time ago
I would die before I

Baby I don't care
Baby I don't care
Baby I don't care
Oh I don't care
Baby I don't care
Don't tell me you're pure
As you spread like a plague
I've figured it out
You're the rat
Baby I don't care
Baby I don't care
Don't tell me you're pure
As you spread like a plague
I've figured it out
You're the rat, rat in the cage

You're the rat in the cage
