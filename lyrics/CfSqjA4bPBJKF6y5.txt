I know tomorrow's not today
I'm on my knees but not to pray
I feel what's real just slip away
I hope you like my, I hope you love my
I hope you see my private public breakdown

The secret service
I make them nervous

I watch the traffic passing by
I'm pretty sure that I can fly
Over the trees, but twice as high
My strange behavior, I gotta let give
'Cause I'm the savior resurrected

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I don't need meds to tie me down
Or squads of feds to stand around
'Cause I love floating off the ground
So welcome to my, I hope you like my
I think I love my private public breakdown

And I assure you
That given time
I can cure you
