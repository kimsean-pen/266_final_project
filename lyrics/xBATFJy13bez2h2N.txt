Something isn't right, I feel it in my bones
Every time I look around, it follows me home
I think I'm paranoid

Something isn't right, I feel it in my bones
Every time I look around, it follows me home
And I get so stressed out
With nobody here to listen
When my head gets loud
From the weight of this vision

All this emptiness inside
I can't fill the void in my mind
Sometimes I just wanna die
Wish that I could tell you why
Is it all inside my head?
I just can't escape the noise
Is it all inside my head?
I think I'm paranoid
I think I'm paranoid
I think I'm paranoid

Is it all in my head? I can't escape the noise
Is it all in my head? I think I'm paranoid
Take me to the edge like hands around my neck
Hanging by a thread again, I think I'm paranoid

Something isn't right, think they start to notice
Hear it in the night, in and out of focus
And I get so stressed out
With nobody here to listen
Got a head full of doubt
From the weight of this vision

All this emptiness inside
I can't fill the void in my mind
Sometimes I just wanna die
Wish that I could tell you why
Is it all inside my head?
I just can't escape the noise
Is it all inside my head?
I think I'm paranoid
I think I'm paranoid
I think I'm paranoid

Is it all in my head? I can't escape the noise
Is it all in my head? I think I'm paranoid
Take me to the edge
Like hands around my neck
Hanging by a thread again
I think I'm paranoid

All this emptiness inside
I can't fill the void in my mind
Sometimes I just wanna die
Wish that I could tell you why
Is it all inside my head?
I just can't escape the noise
Is it all inside my head?
I think I'm paranoid
