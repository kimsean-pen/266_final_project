I can't sleep, no, not like I used to
I can't breathe in and out like I need to
It's breaking ice
Now, to make any movement
What's your vice?
You know that mine's the illusion
And all at once (as I'm trying) I can
help you out (just to get things right)

I'll be what you need (I kill myself to make
everything perfect for ya)
Goodbye apathy, so long apathy

So don't sit still, don't you move away from here
So goodbye apathy (as I'm trying), so long fancy free
(just to keep things right)

Goodbye apathy, (kill myself to make everything perfect for ya)
I don't wanna be you

I don't walk right, not like I used to
There's a jump in my step as I rush to see you
I could be happy here as long as you're near to me
As long as you're close to me
Now that I'm alright (as I'm trying) I can help you
out (just to keep things right)
I'll be what you need (I kill
myself to make everything perfect for ya)

I'll do anything...
Goodbye apathy
So goodbye apathy

So don't you stop pushing me, I can take so much
So goodbye apathy (as I'm trying), so long fancy free
(just to get things right while I)

Goodbye apathy (kill myself to make everything perfect for ya)
I don't wanna be... you...

Everybody is watching you
Everybody is watching me too
Everybody is watching you
Everybody is watching me too
Everybody is watching you (I can't sleep, no)
Everybody is watching me too (not like I used to)
Everybody is watching you (I can't breathe in and out)
Everybody is watching me too (like I need to)
Everybody is watching you (It's breaking ice now)
Everybody is watching me too (to make any movement)
Everybody is watching you (What's your vice?)
Everybody is watching me too (You know that mine's the illusion)
