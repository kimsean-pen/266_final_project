Come when you need me, leave me when you need to be free
Come when you want me, leave me when you need me to understand
Did you fall out of love, because you fell in love again?
Did you fall out of love, because you fell in love, with someone new?

When the new love, shined with all the promise of all I couldn't give to you.
And the new life offered all you wanted, and you had to choose

I helped to carry you, I took good care of you, I wanted us to continue
But I knew, that you would leave, when the time was right for you.

Life was a relay I passed it off to you. You ran away, and won the race
You never looked back, to see what happened to me, For I was only second place

When the new love, shined with all the promise of all I couldn't give to you.
And the new life offered all you wanted, and you were asked to choose.

We come together to share your sorrows - where you save yourself for someone else.
You keep your distance in times of hope, while I cry (for you) all by myself

When you're silver, you never come first, When you're silver, the truth always hurts.

I don't want unconditional love, Ill always need to be judged
I don't want a traditional love, Ill always need to be wanted/loved by someone else

When did the city make you so cold?
We share your sorrows but I dine alone...
When did the city make you so cold?
I cry alone - while you dine with someone else

When did the city make you so cold?
We cry together but I dine alone...
When did the city make you so cold?
We share your sorrows but I dine alone... I always dine alone...
