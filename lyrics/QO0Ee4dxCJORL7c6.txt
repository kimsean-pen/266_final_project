While we may believe
Our world - our reality
To be that is - is but one
Manifestation of the essence

Other planet lie beyond the reach
Of normal sense and common roads
But they are no less real
Than what we see or touch or feel

Denied by the blind church
Cause these are not the words of God
The same God that burnt the Knowing
