What drives me to my man
Earthly or divine or otherwise
Is no business of mine

You wasted my time
You wasted my time

Deep down I never did feel right
Even now sometimes that feeling's a lie

You wasted my time
You wasted my time

A heart long desperate oh just for a little bit
A heart long-desperate
oh for something I had all along

I don't need you love
I don't need you love
I don't need you to understand

I need you to listen
