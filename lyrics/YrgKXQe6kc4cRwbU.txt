Someday as I look at the sun
I think of you and traces we leave behind
Like a fallen piece we'll make a better start
But still end up alone
Looking down upon a place inside our heart
Dividing us in two
Somewhere all that we leave behind
Lingers on, longing for lullabies
You live, you learn, you love, you burn
You win, you lose, becoming you
Someday when I cry in the rain
I think of you looking through eyes of pain
Passing on a feeling that we can't deny
Over on to you
Fading memory is soon becoming blind
Dividing us in two
Somewhere all that we leave behind
Lingers on, longing for lullabies
You live, you learn, you love, you burn
You win, you lose, becoming you
