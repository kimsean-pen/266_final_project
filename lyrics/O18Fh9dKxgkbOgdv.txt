I caught your dog as she was running through the door
I saw your mom
Your father had his arms around her
Happy, your family
Could you please tone it down a bit?
I can't see me contracting morality from my genetics
He held her hand
So we'd sit back
My father said
That this'd pass
Hollow out
I hollow out the awful part, swollen in the pit of my gut
It's been collecting all and keeping all the penance that I owe
but I've been sleeping in 'cause I can't bleed her blood out of me
I keep a long list
That I reference so I can better understand what I've been missing
Not quite a person
Hollow out
I hollow out the awful part
Hollow out
I hollow out the awful part
There's good in me 'cause I can feel his influence
He tried for me
My father had his arms around her
