I'm underwater
And I'm on fire
There's nothing wilder than my heart
Just let the current
Set an emotion
Then nothing can keep us apart
We're all swimming into the light
I want you by my side
And I'm right here waiting for you
Right here waiting for you
We're all living on by our time
I've been holding my breath all night
Waiting for you

I'm diving into that deep end
And I'm not scared
I'm not scared
And I've been way over my head
And I'm not scared
I'm not scared
No...

I am an island
You are an ocean
I wanna float here in your arms
High as the mountains
Deep in devotion
There's nothing wilder than your heart
We're all swimming into the light
I want you by my side
And I'm right here waiting for you
Right here waiting for you
We're all living on by our time
I've been holding my breath all night
Waiting for you

And now I'm diving into the deep end
And I'm not scared
I'm not scared
And I've been way over my head
And I'm not scared
I'm not scared
No-oh...

I'd follow you straight to the bottom
Not afraid
Hell, I don't bother*
I wanna dive into you
I'd follow you straight to the bottom
Not afraid
Hell, I don't bother*
I wanna dive into you

I'm underwater
And I'm on fire

And now I'm diving into the deep end
And I'm not scared
I'm not scared
And I've been way over my head
And I'm not scared
I'm not scared
No-oh...

I'd followed you straight to the bottom
Not afraid
Hell, I don't bother.
I wanna dive into you
I'd followed you straight to the bottom
Not afraid
Hell, I don't bother.
I wanna dive into you
