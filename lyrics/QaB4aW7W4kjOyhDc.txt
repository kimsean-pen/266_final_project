Oah-kayyyyy!

You talk and talk and you just can't stop
But when it comes to mine - it's crock
What you say, is lackluster
I thrash emcees who try to bring a filibuster

Yeah, right, get off me
Tell me somethin new to start with thee
Said see you later, when you comin home?
It's a gift, it's a curse, it's a telephone

Now let's start over with a nice clean slate
Please stop stressin with the hurry up wait
Heard you the first time, that sounds great
But back up out my space, okay?
(Yeah yeah, right right) OKAY!

Okay!
Okay!
Okay!
Okay!

Got the pink ribbon, so pretty
My name's Mike D from New York City
I guess it's all, in the mind
What, I, leave, behind

Go to these schools like a nice mad professor
Then I show chagrin every word that you utter
Yes you said you are a big deal
But money calm down - for real!

Got, to control my mind

Get to slow down, rewind
What, is goin on in my head?
Was this guy on med?
(What is goin on in my head? Was that guy on meds?)
(What is goin on in my head?

What is goin on in my head? Was that guy on meds?
(What is goin on in my head?)
What is goin on in my head? Was that guy on meds?
(What is goin on in my head?)
What is goin on in my head? Was that guy on meds?
(What is goin on in my head?)

Now, I don't give a fuck who the hell you are
Please stop shoutin in your cellular
I never asked you for part of your day
So please stop shoutin in your phone, okay

You loud like a cop
Take a look and take a look and then stop
Took a minute get your mind unlocked
Get the rhythm when I do the wop

What's goin on in in my head?
And why has this guy gone all red?
Be kind, rewind
At least tell me what it is I did
Or just say what should I say
Hmmm... okay!

(Yeah yeah, right, right) OKAY!
Okay!
Okay!
Okay!
Okay!
