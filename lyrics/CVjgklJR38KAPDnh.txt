Nothing feels as good as when you lift me up
When I come get my heart
If I'm gonna get my trust
Ooh oh oh it's just how we feelin'
Ooh oh oh it's how I'm feelin

Tired of waiting all these fakin'
And I see enough
I need one thing, hold on nothing
I don't ask for much!

I just want your love
I just want your love
You're all I need
I just want your love
I just want your love
You're all I need

If I was to need one thing is know 'bout what you do
Oh, and you should know that this is a good thing
I won't be your fool
Ooh oh oh it's just how we feelin'
Ooh oh oh it's how I'm feelin

I just want your love
I just want your love
You're all I need
I just want your love
I just want your love
You're all I need

Tired of waiting all these fakin'
And I see enough
I need one thing, hold on nothing
I don't ask for much!

I just want your love
I just want your love
You're all I need
I just want your love
I just want your love
You're all I need
You're all I need
