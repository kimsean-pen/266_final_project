Bathe in the dark for me
Wait 'til you hear my feet

Through and through
They want to walk all over you
Gone where they can't follow

Bathe underwater with me
Swim 'til you're half asleep

Through and through
They want to sink and maroon you
Put on your bag, take me
Closer to trawl, but much, much further

Through and through
I'm the ocean under you
Put on your bag, take me
Closer to trawl, but much, much further

Closer to trawl, but much, much further
Closer to trawl, but much, much further
Closer to trawl, but much, much further
Closer to trawl, but much, much further
