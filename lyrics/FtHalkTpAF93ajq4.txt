Chemicals in that medical
Never knew I should've left for you
Guess its cool I need get it through
Guess I caught you in an awful mood
Not my fault I didn't talk it through
All just messed up, its all just news
We lay straight down with twisted views
Rapid eye talked our silent truth
Rather bang 2 heads with the skulls in the pan
Rather bang 2 heads with the mighty dam
Might be he saw that a' slight of hand
Then knocked his jaw silly with a fist full of can
Head face first hear the concrete slam
Out came is blood like a broken dam
Drunk old hitting to a bootleg jam
Left my dreams in box made of sand

All I see are these colours
We walk with distant others
But really what is it all to me
Someone help me I'm drowning
And these places all surrounding
But you where never looking to me
All I see are these colours
We walk with distant others
But really what is it all to me
Someone help me I'm drowning
And these places all surrounding
But you where never looking to me
