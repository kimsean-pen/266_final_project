Do you ever feel like the only one?
'Cause I always feel like the only one
Yeah, it ain't no fun!
See, she knows that I love her but I don't think she'll stay,
and she knows that I need her, but my love lost its weight
Spend my days longing for something real
Spend my days stuck in the way I feel

Another sad Saturday waiting for you babe
Another sad Saturday waiting for you, you you
Another sad Saturday waiting for you babe
Another sad Saturday waiting for you, you you

Do you ever dream of finer things
'Cause I always dream of the finest things
See, she knows that she's got it but she's still self absorbed
and she knows how to flaunt it, but she flaunt at the core
Spend my nights longing for something real
Spend my nights stuck in the way I feel

Another sad Saturday waiting for you babe (I'm waiting for you)
Another sad Saturday waiting for you (I'm waiting for you)
Another sad Saturday waiting for you babe (I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you)
Another sad Saturday waiting for you

I know you don't believe my
(and I believed it)
It all hurts the same
It all hurts the same
It all hurts the same
It all hurts the same

I know you don't believe my
(and I believed it)
It all hurts the same
It all hurts the same
It all hurts the same
It all hurts the same

Why won't you let me in?
Why won't you let me in?
I dare you to let me in
I dare you to let me in

I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait no more
I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait no more
