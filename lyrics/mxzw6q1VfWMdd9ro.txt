Oh you feel and you taste it and you want to go higher
So what do you do
And so you peak into the mountain where your desire goes
Spilt blood on this place it only echoes true all through the days
And so you peak into the mountain where your desire goes

Oh having the space to know the way it is coming down
Take it on down the line
Oh having the space to know the way it is coming down
Take it on down the line

Well it's hard to get ahead when the center is bleeding
They tear out the middle and they send it all away
Tasteless lead sitting on our tongues
And then we have to worry more about the ones we love
When you see there's smoke there's fire
When you see there's smoke there's fire
When you see there's smoke there's fire
When you see there's smoke there's fire

Oh having the space to know the way it is coming down
Take it on down the line
Oh having the space to know the way it is coming down
Take it on down the line

Oh you feel and you taste it and you want to go higher
So what do you do
And so you peak into the mountain where your desire goes
Spit blood on this place it only echoes true all through the day
And so you peak into the mountain where your desire goes
Oh having the space to know the way it is coming down
Take it on down the line
Oh having the space to know the way it is coming down
Take it on down the line
