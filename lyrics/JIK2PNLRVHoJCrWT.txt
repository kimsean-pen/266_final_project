I, I prefer your love
To Jesus

Little baby on your knees
Cause the world has got you down

Name tag to the sick at the side of them
Tight-walking the sidewalk in spite of them
As my head it moves from east to west
Mother, won't you open your arms and
Forgive me of all these bad thoughts I'm
Blinded to the faces in the fog

But all the good in me is because of you
It's true
I, I prefer your love
To Jesus
I, I prefer your love
To Jesus

Little baby on your knees
Cause the world has got you down

King size country, where in the worries I
Endlessly roseate by the pylons
As a careless sun set it's on the west
Sure as mother licking a finger
Wipe the blush and the smudge from my cheek and
Wonder what will become of your little one

But all the good in me is because of you
It's true
I, I prefer your love
To Jesus
I, I prefer your love
To Jesus

Little baby on your knees
Cause the world has got you down
