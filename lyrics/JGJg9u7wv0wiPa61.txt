I'm not as cool as what i'd like to be
I don't need you to tell me
When we go down to the country
I like it when you b side me

I know you're not alone tonight
That's alright with me
Yeah that's alright with me

I know you're alone tonight
Come over so am i

I think that you're great
Let's just be friends
And hold hands til 2am
It's okay when im just a b-side

I tell you what'd do if it was me
I don't mind how i am feeling hearing the side-b

I know you're not alone tonight
That's alright with me
Yeah that's alright with me

I know you're not alone tonight
Come over so am i

I think that you're great
Let's just be friends
And hold hands til 2am
It's okay when im just a b-side

I know you're alone tonight
Come over so am i

I think that you're great
Let's just be friends
And hold hands til 2am
It's okay cuz we were always be great

Let's just be friends
And hold hands til 2am
It's okay when im just a b-side
