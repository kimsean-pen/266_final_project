Huh-hah!
Huh-hah!
Huh-hah!
Huh-hah!
To the Door!
To the Door!
To the Door!
To the Door!
To the Door!
To the Door!
To the Door!
To the Door! Door! Door!

(Ahhhhhh!)
Where do you think you're going
With that bag of yours?
To the Door (Huh-hah!)
To the Door!

Where do you think you're headed!?
Come here back for more!
To the Door (Huh-hah!)
To the Door!

Baby don't go to the door (Huh!)
Drag your feet along the floor (Hah!)
Come on back into our den (Huh!)
We can drink some wine and then (Hah!)
Love me til' our lips are sore (Huh!)
Baby, don't go to the door (Hah!)
Baby don't go (Huh!), to... (Hah!)

But the streets are lined with Filth
The scum will rise to the top
In glass buildings they throw rocks
So I'm moving to Leipzig

(Ahhhhhh!)
Where do you think you're going?
I told you thrice before!
To the Door (Huh-hah!)
To the Door!
Don't leave this house
Rats run the streets
They're rotten to the core
To the Door (Huh-hah!)
To the Door!

Baby don't go, to the door (Huh!)
Drag your feet along the floor (Hah!)
Come on back into our den (Huh!)
We can drink some wine and then (Hah!)
Love me til' our lips are sore (Huh!)
Baby, don't go to the door (Hah!)
Baby don't go (Huh!), to... (Hah!)

But the streets are lined with Filth
The scum will rise to the top
In glass buildings they throw rocks
I'm moving to Leipzig

Streets! Filth! Move to Leipzig!
Streets! Filth! Move to Leipzig!
Streets! Filth! Move to Leipzig!
Streets!
Filth!
Filth!
Filth, filth
