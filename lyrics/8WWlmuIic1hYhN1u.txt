I will reach out
for your light
and grasp for the sky.

When raindrops fall
the blood in my veins
is filled with golden dust.
Raindrops fall
and the heart in my hands
is filled with golden dust.

Guide me the path
I will follow you
wherever you take me to.

When raindrops fall
the blood in my veins
is filled with golden dust.

Raindrops fall
and the heart in my hands
is filled with golden dust.
