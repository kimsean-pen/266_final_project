I can't pretend anymore
That I am not affected, I'm not moved
I could lie to myself
That I'm not always thinking of you

You make me strong
You show me I'm not weak to fall in love
But I thought I'd never need
Now I can't get enough

I always made it on my own
I always thought that I would keep control
You changed everything I believe in
Now I just can't fight this feeling, baby

I raise my hands and I surrender
'Cause your love, it's too strong
And I can't go on
Without your tender arms around me

I raise my hands and I surrender
I don't wanna resist
'Cause your touch and your kiss have shattered my defenses
I surrender

I have to admit
That I, I've never thought
I'd need someone this way
'Cause you open my eyes
So that I, I can see so much more

I always made it on my own
I always talk that I would keep control
You changed everything I believe in
And now I just can't fight this feeling, baby

I raise my hands and I surrender
'Cause your love, it's too strong
And I can't go on
Without your tender arms around me

I raise my hands and I surrender
I don't wanna resist
'Cause your touch and your kiss have shattered my defenses
I surrender

I surrender to the feeling in my heart
(Surrender, surrender)
I surrender to the safety of your arms
(Surrender)
To the touch of your lips, to the taste of your kisses

I raise my hands and I surrender
Oh, baby, baby
'Cause your love, it's too strong
And I can't go on
Without your tender arms around me

I raise my hands and I surrender
'Cause your love, it's too strong
And I can't go on
Without your, without your
I surrender

I raise my hands and I surrender
'Cause your love, it's too strong
And I can't go on
Without your tender arms around me
And I surrender

(I surrender, surrender)
I can't pretend anymore
(I surrender)
I could lie to myself
That I'm not always thinking of you
