We were together as one
All that we had can't be undone
Our love fading, now it's gone
Our time fading, so it's done

The blood that binds us
(It's the blood that binds us)
Till death unites us

Alone we die, my frozen Angel
Alone we fade away from this world
Alone you die, my frozen Angel
Alone you fade away, from this world

We were together as one
All that we had can't be undone
Our love fading, the feeling is gone
Our time ending, now it's done

Alone we die, my frozen Angel
Alone we fade away from this world
Alone you die, my frozen Angel
Alone you fade away, from this world

Alone we die, my frozen Angel
Alone we fade away from this world
Alone you die, my frozen Angel
Alone you fade away, from this world
Nothing I do, nothing I say
Fade away
My angel
