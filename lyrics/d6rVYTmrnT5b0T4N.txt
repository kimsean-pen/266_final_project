Buying, you're all buying
All the things you're denying
Sick of all this nothingness, everything is meaningless
All your laughs end in sighing
Feeding on your empty brain, everything is just a game
Lying, you're all lying
Ignorance should be a crime, all religions stand in line
Fighting, you're all fighting
If you know what is to be, why didn't you predict me?
Crying, you're all crying
So masturbate me, entertain me

We won't obey
You'll never get your way
We will always have our say
Just leave us alone
Leave our world alone
We can stand up on our own

Buying, you're all buying
All the things you're denying
Sick of all this nothingness, everything is meaningless
All your laughs end in sighing
Feeding on your empty brain, everything is just a game
Lying, you're all lying
Ignorance should be a crime, all religions stand in line
Fighting, you're all fighting
So masturbate me, entertain me

We won't obey
You'll never get your way
We will always have our say
Just leave us alone
Leave our world alone
We can stand up on our own
We won't obey

(Fight, fight)
Fight all your institutions
(Fight, fight)
Starting a revolution

(Fight, fight)
Fight all your institutions
(Fight, fight)
Starting a revolution

(Fight, fight)
Fight all your institutions
(Fight, fight)
Starting a revolution, ooh

So masturbate me, entertain me
We won't obey
You'll never get your way
We will always have our say

Just leave us alone
Leave our world alone
We can stand up on our own
'Cause we won't obey
