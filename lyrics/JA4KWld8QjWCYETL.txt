Hey
Are you up?
Don't mean to wake you
But I've got bad news
Hey
Is there someone you can talk to?
Hey, hey
Are you sitting down?

Impure toxic devotion
Runs through me like a river to a plastic ocean, yeah
Chemicals burn inside my heart
I'm holding on like a car that just can't start
And I could go for miles and miles
Yeah I could have crashed and still turned round
But it's too late, yeah
What's my fate?

Trash! trash! trash for you!
I'm trash! trash! trash for you
I'm trash
For you, I'm trash

Hey, remember when
It was good and
Kissing felt like oxygen?
It was green
But I can't see that hilltop now
It's all turned grey
And it was a landfill
Anyway

Impure toxic devotion
Runs through me like a river to a plastic ocean, yeah
Chemicals burn inside my heart
I'm holding on like a car that just can't start
And I could have go for miles and miles
Yeah I could have crashed and still turned round
But it's too late
What's my fate?

Trash! trash! trash for you!
I'm trash! trash! trash for you
I'm trash
For you, I'm trash
Trash! trash! trash for you!
I'm trash! trash! trash for you
I'm trash
For you, I'm trash

I'll only change you can burn me
But I'll never go away
I'll only change, you can burn me
But I'll never go away
Yeah, I'll only ever change
You can burn me, but I'll never go away
Yeah, I'll only ever change
Only ever change
Yeah I'll never go away

Trash! trash! trash for you!
I'm trash! trash! trash for you
I'm trash
For you, I'm trash
Trash! trash! trash for you!
I'm trash! trash! trash for you
I'm trash
For you, I'm trash
Trash! trash! trash for you!
I'm trash! trash! trash for you
I'm trash
For you, I'm trash
Ain't going away, yeah
