See by now I would have learned just how you love to hurt me
Before I get a chance to speak you're convinced I'm guilty

God knows I've been a very bad boy
You've been telling me
You've been telling me
But God knows I didn't break your toys but
You're blaming me
You're blaming me

I feel thrown out the window
You seem to enjoy
You don't have to be so
So hard on your boy
You don't have to be so
So search and destroy
I feel thrown out the window
You're too hard on your boy
You're too hard on your boy

Now I don't mind a little pain when I've really earned it yeah
But you got me whipped and chained when I don't deserve it

God knows I've been a very bad boy
You've been telling me
You've been telling me
But God knows I didn't break your toys but
You're blaming me
You're blaming me

I feel thrown out the window
You seem to enjoy
You don't have to be so
So hard on your boy
You don't have to be so
So search and destroy
I feel thrown out the window
You're too hard on your boy
You're too hard on your boy

A-Sha-a-sha-ame a-sha-a-sha-ame

Sha-a-sha-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ame

I feel thrown out the window
You seem to enjoy
You don't have to be so
So hard on your boy
You don't have to be so
So search and destroy
I feel thrown out the window
You're too hard on your boy
You're too hard on your boy
I feel
A-Sha-a-sha-amed a-sha-a-sha-amed
