It was one for you
It was three for me
It was very nice
It was everything
So here it is
In little pieces

I didn't win or lose
I just threw the cards
But I paid a price for it
It's alright baby
I'm doing the best that I can

The whispered secrets
They go on and on
No one says anything to anyone
You watch after her
Your word is law
She thought she was out there
Nobody saw

I didn't win or lose
I just played the part
But I paid a price for it
It's alright baby
I'm doing the best I can

I was silent
I was locked away
Silent all day
It was out of my hands, yeah

In my distress
I wanted someone to blame me
In my devastation
I wanted so to change

In my wake
Disaster was the only thing
That I could depend on
But it's alright baby
I'm doing the best that I can

And I'm trying hard to change
I'm doing the best that I can
He says, "Well I hear you're doing fine."
"And that you're doing it the best that you can."
