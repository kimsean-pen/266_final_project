I've been mistreated,
I've been abused,
I've been struck downhearted,
Baby,
I've been confused.
'Cause I know,
Yes, I know,
I've been mistreated.
Since my baby left me,
I've been losing my mind,
You know I have.

I've been lonely,
I've been cold,
I've been looking for a woman, uh
To have and hold.
'Cause I know,
Yes, I know,
I've been mistreated,
Yeah...
Since my baby left me,
I've been losing,
I've been losing,
I've been losing my mind,
Baby baby babe.
I've been mistreated,
I've been abused,
I've been looking for a woman,
I've been confused.
'Cause I know,
Yes, I know,
I've been mistreated,
Ooh o-o-oh,
Since my baby left me,
I've been losing,
Losing,
I've been losing my mind,
Baby, baby, babe.
Oh oh oh,
Oh woman, oh woman, oh woman.
I've been losing my mind.
