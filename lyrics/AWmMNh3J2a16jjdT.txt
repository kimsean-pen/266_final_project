This fluid feels like pain
This stoic mood is all in vain
I reach into the dark
I tear this other me apart
How many years ago?
How many deaths I can't let go?
My flesh is temporary
My God, extraordinary

You can't kill my mind
A man delivered
Can never make his way in darkness
I know tonight will end
But I won't give this life away again

Sifting through this same debris
Oh my father, call to me
This smoke is in my blood
This home is just no good
Save me from my bitterness
Give me up, I did my best
Shock this system full of shit
Mock this fucker lost in it

You can't kill my mind
A man delivered
Can never make his way in darkness
I know tonight will end
But I won't give this life away
But I won't give this life away again

A man surrendered
Can never find his own forgiveness
I know my life will end
But I won't give tonight away
I won't give tonight away again

This fluid feels like pain
This ruin feels like rain
I reach into the past
My future's fading fast
How many years ago?
How many I let go?
My flesh is all I have
My face is happenstance
This smoke is in my blood
This life is not enough
This life is not enough
This life is not enough
