High, we get so high
But we fall down
It's no surprise
Here we go, fighting
There you go again
Light on your own
Let this love turn to stone
Here we go, fighting
There you go again
Here we go again

So let me go, let me go
I don't know how we broke
Something incredible

You shot me in the heart this time
I hope you know, hope you know
You let it go
Lost it all
Something incredible
You shot me in the heart this time

Don't call me home
You only gave what you stole
There I go, hurting
There I go again
Here we go again

So let me go, let me go
I don't know how we broke
Something incredible

You shot me in the heart this time
I hope you know, hope you know
You let it go
Lost it all
Something incredible
You shot me in the heart this time

Only tried to make you
Only tried to make you mine
Only tried to make you
Only tried to make you mine

So let me go, let me go
I don't know how we broke
Something incredible

You shot me in the heart this time
I hope you know, hope you know
You let it go
Lost it all
Something incredible
You shot me in the heart this time
Shot me in the heart this time
Shot me in the heart this time
