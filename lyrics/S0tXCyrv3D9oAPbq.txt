Don't know if I should leave myself alone
If I should try at all
Ought to but I have no control
I'm rummaging around
I'm pummeling the ground

Ooh, why for?
Ooh, why for?
Ooh, why for?
Ooh

It's been a year, I'm still stuck in this hole
It's not your fault you found another home
So I've been trying to keep my weight above
I'm stumbling, I fall
I'm tripping all around
Ooh, around

Ooh, whoa
Whoa
Ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh

And I don't if I should just go
I'll be alright without you here
Dream I put you out my halo
Signs at my back as I see my tear
I guess I'll be alright this time
'Cause I can see you're doing fine
But I, I need to be by myself
I mean, I sing for myself, I bleed for myself
I breathe for myself
But you're still in my core
What do I want you for?
(What do I want you for?)
What do I need you for?
(What do I need you for?)

Why for?
Ooh, whoa
Whoa
Ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh
