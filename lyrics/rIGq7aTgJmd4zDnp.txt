Do you want me to show my love?
Do you want me to be who I am?
Make it irresistible
Make me feel like you know that I can
Bare my soul and bare my dreams
Maybe it's not all that it seems
Do you know what love is?
Do you wanna know if I know
Show me what your love is
If you wanna know what I know
Do you know what love is?
Do you wanna know if I know
Take me all the way
It's better if you say

Show me your love, love, love
Show me your love
Show me your love, love, love
Show me your love
Show me your love, love, love
Show me your love
Show me your love, love, love
Show me your love

What do you think of yourself?
Do you wonder who you are?
Do you think you're destructible?
Do you think you could be a part of me?
Do you think it all leads up to nothing?
Do you think we'll wake up in another place
Do you think it all leads up to something
Do you think we'll make it if we try to change?
Do you think we'll make it?
Do you think we'll wake up?
Do you think we'll wake up?
Feeling like we've changed
