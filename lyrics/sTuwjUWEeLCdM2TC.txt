Listen to the eye of intuition,
pattern it in play.
Stop the drift from drowning your heart in it,
just to waste away.
You don't even need them, you're your own you say;
bridges light your way.
I could only screen you from your window,
no more than delay.
You want it to reach an end.
You would like it over when you cannot save that someone in you
from you giving in.
I can't make you stand your ground.
Oh, do it for the truth you found.
It is notwithstanding how,
oh, all of us confide in you.
When you trust, your words are one.
You never gave your troubled mind
voice of instinct.
I will lie to you the way you did to have your say
in good company.
Turn the game around and make it work my way,
second you to me.
We will find a way to put our strife to end,
stronger than we were.
I will mend the circles we lost in the sand,
to what we defer.
You want it to reach an end.
You would like it over when you cannot save that someone in you
from you giving in.
I can't make you stand your ground.
Oh, do it for the truth you found.
It is notwithstanding how,
oh, all of us confide in you.
When we trust, our words are one.
You never gave your troubled mind
voice of instinct.
Trust, our words are one
let you know the faith you won,
heard your instincts.
You want it to reach an end.
You would like it over when you cannot save that someone in you
from you giving in.
