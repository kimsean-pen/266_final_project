No wonder you're looking thin
when all that you live on
is lipgloss and cigarettes
And scraps at the end of the day when
he's given the rest
to someone with long black hair
All those nights in, making such a mess of the bed
Oh you never ever want to go home
And he wants you so you may as well hang around for a while
call your Dad on the phone
He changed his mind last Monday
so you've got to leave by Sunday
yeah
You've lost your lipgloss Honey
Oh yeah
Now nothing you do
can turn him on
there's something wrong
You had it once
but now it's gone
And you feel such a fool
for laughing at bad jokes
and putting up with all of his friends
and kissing in public
What are they going to say
when they run into you again?
That your stomach looks bigger
and your hair is a mess
and your eyes are just holes in your face
And it rains every day and when it doesn't
the sun makes you feel worse anyway
He changed his mind last Monday
so you've got to leave by Sunday
yeah
You've lost your lipgloss Honey
Oh yeah
Now nothing you do
can turn him on
there's something wrong
You had it once
but now it's gone
Though you knew there was no way
it was going to last for ever
it still shook you
when he told you in a letter
that he didn't
want to see you
You nearly lost your mind
Oh yeah
You've lost your lipgloss Honey
Oh yeah
Now nothing you do
can turn him on
there's something wrong
You had it once
but now it's gone
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
ah-ah-ah-ah...
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...
Oh yeah
