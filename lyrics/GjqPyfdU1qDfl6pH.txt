Don't say a word
Don't be grateful
if I ever made you laugh
let's make believe
what's at stake here's more than just your reputation

she's got the photos, but no recollection
he's got the motive, but no transportation

you'll be carving this across my chest
are you cutting me out now
after crawling inside

turn away your head
what do I deserve, what do I deserve, instead
it's a surprise you haven't caught on yet
it's nothing personal, you're an embarrassment
don't cut me out

we're offering nothing but the best accommodations
just tell us who you are, just tell us who you are

we're offering nothing but the best accommodations
just tell us who you are, just tell us who you are

turn away your head
what do I deserve, what do I deserve, instead
it's a surprise you haven't caught on yet
it's nothing personal, you're an embarrassment
don't cut me out
it's a surprise you haven't caught on yet
it's nothing personal, you're an embarrassment
don't cut me out
