Should we dissolve this?
It's not doing any favours

Be my desire, my pleasure, my pain
Never could see this coming
Called it forever, we're caught in the game
Or maybe we're both too plain
Both in this, out a presion

You wanna ride but keep on rocking the boat
Soon it will tip us over
And there won't be another

There you go, there you go
You're saying all the things you want
Now I know I can take it
Now I see we are breaking down
Don't say it to me
There I go, there I go
I'm doing all the things you want
Now I don't think we'll make it
Now we are close to dead and gone

Just when I thought it had fall into bliss
Get weak without destruction
Fight you with fire to throw it away
You push me again and again and again
There's no surprises

I'll never forget that day
Talking your eyes, couldn't make what you're saying
You were caught on your mind, now we're dissipating
Easygoing, you're not temptation

There you go, there you go
You're saying all the things you want
Now I know I can take it
Now I see we are breaking down
Don't say it to me
There I go, there I go
I'm doing all the things you want
Now I don't think we'll make it
Now we are close to dead and gone

Should we dissolve this?
It's not doing any favours
Won't let it get between us anymore
