7-A
What number is this to?
7-A
Okay, don't get excited man, it's 'cause I'm short, I know

Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings
Of the bluebird as she sings
The six o'clock alarm would never ring

But it rings and I rise
Wipe the sleep out of my eyes
My shavin' razor's cold and it stings

Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen

You once thought of me
As a white knight on his steed
Now, you know how happy I can be

Whoa, and our good times start and end
Without dollar one to spend
But how much, baby, do we really need

Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen

Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen

Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen

Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen
