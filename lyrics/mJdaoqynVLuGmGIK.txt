I didn't know that I was broken
Until I found my missing piece
It seemed like every door was closing on me
And you were so far out of reach

Drunk on the night, you got lips like your wine
I got nothing but time for you
Feeling so high on that look in your eyes
I got nothing but time for you

(O-o-o-o-o-oh)
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
That loneliness is my disease (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
That you are the remedy (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
That you are the remedy (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
That you are the remedy

I didn't have no one to turn to
Yeah, I was circling the drain, mhm
Now you show me I can learn to, yeah
How to be okay again, oh-oh

Feeling so high on that look in your eyes
I got nothing but time for you, ooh

(O-o-o-o-o-oh)
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
That loneliness is my disease (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
That you are the remedy
(You are, you are, yeah)
(You are, you are, yeah)
That you are the remedy
(You are, you are, yeah)
(O-o-o-o-o-oh)
Yeah, you are the remedy
(O-o-o-o-o-oh, o-o-o-o-o-oh)

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
That loneliness is my disease
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
That you are the remedy

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
(I believe it, I believe it)
That loneliness is my disease (is my disease)
(O-o-o-o-o-oh)
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
(I believe it now)
That you are the remedy
(You are the remedy, oh yeah, yeah, oh)
(O-o-o-o-o-oh)
You are the remedy (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
You are the remedy, oh yeah (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
You are the remedy
