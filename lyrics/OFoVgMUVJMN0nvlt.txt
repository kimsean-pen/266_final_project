Suddenly I'm filled with hope
Today's much better than the day before
Everything looks beautiful
After the rain, after the rain
My world's in color now
My eyes get wide tryna take it in
Everything is good somehow
After the rain, after the rain

Buckets
Filling up my cup like fuck it
I'm running
Make a mess Wu-Tang bring the ruckus
I'm making a mess
Suck it
You left me out in the rain like I was nothin'
You ain't nothin', you're just frontin'
Walkin' 'round like you above it
You ain't above it, you're fuckin' budget
You make me sick to my stomach
I might throw up in a bucket

No more black clouds of dust
I can see forever if I wanted to
It's clearer than it ever was
After the rain, after the rain
Sometimes it hurts so much
Before you feel the freedom of the truth
These chains are destroyed by rust
After the rain, after the rain

Buckets
Filling up my cup like fuck it
I'm running
Make a mess Wu-Tang bring the ruckus
I'm making a mess
Suck it
You left me out in the rain like I was nothin'
You ain't nothin', you're just frontin'
Walkin' 'round like you above it
You ain't above it, you're fuckin' budget
You make me sick to my stomach
I might throw up in a bucket

I might throw up get a bucket
I might throw up get a bucket
