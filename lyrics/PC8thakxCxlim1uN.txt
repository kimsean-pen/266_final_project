Ah, the itchy flakes, it is a flaming
All the gels and cremes, it is pertaining
To a fungus mold cured by injection
Hope it's only ah, a yeast infection

Oh well it hurts when I, it hurts when I pee
Oh well it hurts when I, it hurts when I see

Now I vomit cum and diarrhea on the tile floor like oatmeal pizza
Fill my toilet bowl full of a cloudy puss
I feel the blood becoming chowder rust

Oh well it hurts when I, it hurts when I pee
Oh well it hurts when I, it hurts when I see

Roll into my bed which does consist of
lice bugs and fleas
and yellow mucus
Stained dirt, Vaseline, toe jam & boogers
Stomach acid worms that dance in sugared sludge
