Another day here
Another night there
Another mistake
I just wanna forget
It's been this way for the last two years
I can't seem to stop

Don't know how I feel
Don't know if I'm scared
All I know's I've got so many regrets
It's been this way for the last two years
I can't seem to stop

No, I can't do this on my own
Please tell me you won't go
And leave me alone and cold
Don't let me drown in my mind

Sometimes I'm alright
Sometimes I just hide
Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever make it
It's been this way for, for too many years
I can't seem to stop

Maybe I'll draw the line
Maybe after some time
I'll be okay for more than a weekend
And that's what I should've told myself for the last two years
I can't seem to stop

No, I can't do this on my own
Please tell me you won't go
And leave me alone and cold
Don't let me drown

No, I can't do this on my own
Please tell me you won't go
And leave me alone and cold
Don't let me drown in my mind

Someday I'll find the answer
If you take this chance on me
I won't let you down

Just don't let me drown
Someday I'll find the answer
If you take, I you take this chance on me
I won't let you down
Just don't let me drown

I can't do this on my own

Please tell me you won't go
And leave me alone and cold
Don't let me drown in my mind (don't)
Don't let me drown (woh oh oh)
Don't leave me alone and cold
If I drift away this time
Don't let me drown in my mind
