Margery
My first car
Summer star
After dark

Would you be my, would you be my
Would you be my first car
Would you be my, would you be my
Would you be my first car

Radio
Fuel low
Never slow
Here disco

Red, yellow, green
Proceed Margery
Green, yellow, red
Have now discarded

Angry drivers
I will wait
I have no plans
So won't be late
