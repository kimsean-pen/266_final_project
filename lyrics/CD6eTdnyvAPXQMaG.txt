Little darling, I saw you walking
I was sold
Nowhere to go, not to worry
We've got time to kill

Never want to forget your shape
But slowly I see you fade
See you fade

Little darling, oh we've wasted
Many days
Passion passing, others laughing
Like always

Never want to forget your shape
But slowly I see you fade
See you fade
