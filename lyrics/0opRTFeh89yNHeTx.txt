I wish i could walk by your side and
Be happy the other way
But me i've got no parachute

I wish you are like everybody
Smiling at the brand new day
But for me the night is powerful

Full moon is waiting
For a brand new lullaby
Full moon is waiting
For a brand new lullaby
Whatever happens to me now
I protect my soul
Too many people you know
Are waiting for the sun

I wake up at night and leave you for the stars
I've got to run and hit the boulevard

I wish i could walk by your side and
Be happy the other way
But for me the night is powerful

Postman is waiting
But i don't know where to sign
Postman is waiting
But i don't know where to sign
Whatever happens to me now
I protect my soul
Too many people you know
Are waiting in the sun

I wake up at night and leave you for the stars
I 've got to run and hit the boulevard

I wake up at night and leave you for the stars
I've got to run and hit the boulevard
