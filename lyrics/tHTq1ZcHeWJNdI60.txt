I am the sand stuck under miles of rock
watching the dry air sweep away my thoughts
as we travel protected by shards of glass
driving through the history of a million memories

In a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls
In a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls
In a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls
Climbing a thousand unclimbed trees
I don't know I want to know how it would feel
to be on top of one of these!

I am the root
quickly ascending
up through the surrounding dirt
quickly devoured by a hungry sun
quickly devoured by a hungry son
who is my father
and we are alike
we look alike we talk alike
we are alike
we are alike
we are alike we look alike
we talk alike

Thats why Im hungry
like the bellowing sky
this is no lie
as sure as light
entering eye
want to stay high
everything's cool too cool so cool
and I remember that everything falls

So I take a look around me now, as I speak
and I imagine a disinterested crowd
talking aloud
and I think of what I want most
and the crowd disappears
and a fixated gaze envelopes my wondering mind
and then she recruits and takes me to this place
I've been there before and that's where I saw her face

In a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls
In a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls
In a sea of a hundred dead and loving souls
Climbing a thousand unclimbed trees
I don't know I want to know how it would feel
to be on top of one of these!
