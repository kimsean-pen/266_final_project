I've been thinking 'bout that evening, darling.
We walked further than I thought we would.
You looked at me like I was your answer.
I looked at you like you meant something.
Do you miss me?
Why don't you call me?
No, he's not home.
Did I tell you how I missed you?
I think of you often when I'm alone.
Spent the evening in my bathrobe, darling.
I tried to wash away the thought of you.
You've been getting under my skin.
I didn't want this to mean nothin'.
Did you feel them?
Feel the fireworks, off on our own?
Did I tell you how I felt them?
I think of them often, when he gets home.
A little spark that don't mean nothin'.
A little spark never hurt no one.
A little spark that don't mean nothin'.
A little spark doesn't mean you're the only one
