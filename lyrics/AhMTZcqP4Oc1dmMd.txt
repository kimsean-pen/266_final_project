Paint it
Outside the frame
Waste it
Feel the same
Nothing changed

Get away
I want to watch it all collapse
One crown
And they all fighting for scraps

Go ahead
I want to watch you sink your teeth
Bite down
You're all the same underneath

We're breaking out
Violent sound
You're fading now

We're making
The air turn around
We're sedated
Just let it pull you out
Pull you out
Pull you out
They pull you out

White out
Side shore
Reach out
No I can't see no more

White out
Side shore

We're breaking out
Violent sound
You're fading now

We're making
The air turn around
We're sedated
Just let it pull you out
Pull you out
Pull you out
They pull you out

White out
Side shore
Reach out
No I can't see no more

White out
Side shore
Reach out
No I can't see no more
