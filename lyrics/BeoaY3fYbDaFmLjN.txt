Cold late night, so long ago
When I was not so strong, you know
A pretty man came to me
Never seen eyes so blue

I could not run away
It seemed we'd seen each other in a dream
It seemed like he knew me
He looked right through me
Yea

Come on home, girl
He said with a smile
You don't have to love me yet
Let's get high awhile
But try to understand
Try to understand
Try, try, try to understand
I'm a magic man

Winter nights we sang in tune
Played inside the months of moon
Never think of never
Let this spell last forever

Well summer lover, passed to fall
Tried to realize it all
Mama says she's worried
Growing up in a hurry
Yea

Come on home, girl
Mama cried on the phone
Too soon to lose my baby
Yet my girl should be at home
But try to understand
Try to understand
Try, try, try to understand
He's a magic man, mama
Aaa
He's a magic man

Come on home, girl
He said with a smile
I cast my spell of love on you
A woman from a child
But try to understand
Try to understand
Ohh ohh
Try, try to understand
Try, try, try to understand
He's a magic man
Oh yea
(Ooh)
He got magic hands

Aaa
Aaa
Aaa
Aaa

Come on home, girl
He said with a smile
You don't have to love me yet
Let's get high awhile
But try to understand
Try to understand
Try, try, try to understand
He's a magic man
Yea ohh
