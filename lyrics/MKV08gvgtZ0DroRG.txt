Go on and baby, get the lighter
We're gonna start the fire

The army of words in me
Silent the soldier weeps
Lying here back to back
Waiting for you to react

And sometimes, all I need is a good push
Roll over and whisper some goodness
Go on baby, you be the hero
Now, can we go back to zero?

Go on and get the lighter
We're gonna need some fire
Let's get a little higher
The battlefield is tired

Then why all, all that?
Go on and baby get the lighter
We're gonna start the fire

Just come here and cuddle up
I feel a little rough
I missed you in my sleep
Are you still mad at me?

The moon must have mended my bad mood
Come kiss me the way you're meant to
Last night I was just playing
Let's put it all away and

Go on and get the lighter
We're gonna need some fire
Let's get a little higher
The battlefield is tired

Then why all, all that?
Go on and baby get the lighter
We're gonna start the fire

Go on and baby get the lighter
We're gonna start the fire
Go on and baby get the lighter
We're gonna start the fire, start the fire

Murder!

Climb in, love me, climb in and love me
Go on now, baby, you get it

Had quite a heavy night
So girl, look it all up and bright
The most stubborn girl around
You really know how to bring me down

One more famous night to remember
Let's laugh at my silly temper
Now let's spend the morning sweetly
Get over here now and complete me

Go on and get the lighter
We're gonna need some fire
Let's get a little higher
The battlefield is tired

Then why all, all that?
Go on and baby get the lighter
We're gonna start the fire
Go on and baby get the lighter
We're gonna start the fire

Go on and baby get the lighter
We're gonna start the fire
Go on and baby get the lighter
We're gonna start the fire

Wow
Go on now, baby, you get it
Wow
