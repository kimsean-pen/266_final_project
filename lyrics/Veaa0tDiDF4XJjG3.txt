My mind does the time for the crime against myself
And it comes at the cost of sleep lost
Another day, another dollar
Another night is even harder to swallow

I contemplate my end
I count up all my friends
Weigh out the pros and cons
Who's going to miss me when I'm gone

Who?

Nothing keeps me sane
Like the long walks through the rain
Let the cold come over me
Let it wash away my shame
All the ones that have occupied my head
And all the ones the have occupied my bed

Get out
