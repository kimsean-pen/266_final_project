It was 4 in the morning, tears down my face
I chose to call it time
I tried hard for you baby, no one else mattered
I'd hoped that we'd be fine
As I walked down the hallway,
debris falling, feels like the end of time

I need to wash away the hours I cried last night

I cannot wait for the rain to remove this lover's pain
I cannot wait for the rain to come and fill me up again

Were you scared when I went away?
Did it cross your mind I was just as broken?
You remain underneath the dust
Now the very worst hasn't gone unspoken
I just cried, I only loved once, you were my whole life
Now you're confined to my darkest memories

I need to wash away the hours I cried last night

I cannot wait for the rain to remove this lover's pain
I cannot wait for the rain to come and fill me up again
I cannot wait for the rain to dissolve a lover's flame
I cannot wait for the rain to make a woman of me again

Pour me a drink and bring it over here
I don't want no ice, I'm already cold enough now
In our last days I would lie with you
And you would never even sensed the end was coming soon
(I'm trying but it hurts like mad)
Baby, what you doing now?
Acting like you don't even care that the world outside is broken down
And my lungs have no air

I cannot wait for the rain
I cannot wait for the rain to make a woman of me again
