Ooooh yes
Oh babe
Yes babe
Ooooh yes
Oh babe
yes babe
(I hope she answers my prayer tonight)

Open your heart and let me pour my lovin'
inside of you, baby...
You make me feel like livin' and breathin' again
I wanna touch you

Don't say no, just say yes
Your body's what I need
Don't say no, just say yes
I can hear you callin me

Your my diamond that shines all of the time...
oh mercy me, yeah...
You made me reach my peak
that day you told me that you wanted me,
don't be afraid baby...

Don't say no, just say yes
Your body's what I need
Don't say no, just say yes
I can hear you callin me

You are my season
and you are the reason
I feel the way I do
as our bodies become as one
you're my star
that's what you are (you, you are)

Don't say no, just say yes
Your body's what I need
Don't say no, just say yes
I can hear you callin me

Now let me hear you say yes,
say, say, say yes
say, say, say yes
say, say, say yes
oh yeah, oh yeah
(repeat)

(Speaking)
Come here baby, lay down right here

I don't wanna talk no more
I can feel you, your body, all over mine
Ooh open your door for me
I'm comin in
knock knock
knock knock baby
knock knock
knock knock baby
knock knock
knock knock baby...
