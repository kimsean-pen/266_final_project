To lead a better life
I need my love to be here
Here
Making each day of the year
changing my life with a wave of her hand
nobody can
deny that theres something there
there
running my hands through her hair
both of us thinking how good it can be
someone is speaking
but she doesnt know hes there
I want her everywhere
and if shes beside me I know I need never care
but to lover her is to need her everywhere
knowing that love is to share
each one believing that love never dies
watching there eyes
and hoping im always there
I want her everywhere
and if shes beside me I know I need never care
but to love her is to need her everywhere
knowing that love is to share
each one believing that love never dies
watching their eyes
and hoping Im always there
I will be there
and everywhere
here there and everywhere
end
