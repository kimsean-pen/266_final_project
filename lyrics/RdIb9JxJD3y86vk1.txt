I can respect you with my heart
And I feel your voice behind the train
There's no lesson
All the time you scream in my arms
You took a surprise, you made a surprise

I'm feeling the haze on us
I'm absorving the haze from us
And let me stay, let me stay, maybe one day

I can respect you with my heart
And I feel your voice behind the train
There's nothing I can do
All the time you scream in my arms
You took a surprise, you made a surprise

You're suffering
Feeling like between two sounds

Thank you so much
Thank you so much for your help
Thank you so much
Thank you so much for your help
Thank you so much again
Thank you so much for your help
