Excuse me sir, I would like to leave the ride
Too many emergencies this time
I forgot, I forgot all this, all the troubles at my fingertips
Too many emergencies this time

Excuse me sir, but what is in your bag
Feels like those evil things you had
I forgot, I forgot all this, all these things that they feed us with
Feels like those evil things inside

We caught the fire but nobody escaped
Loved other people, but I don't know their names
I don't know their names

I'm in no fit state, I'm in no fit shape...
To fall in love with you
To make a record of my life
To lose any more than I need
To watch my fingers bleed
To bust my body up
To drink out of your cup
To act a fool in love
Acting hurt's been tough
