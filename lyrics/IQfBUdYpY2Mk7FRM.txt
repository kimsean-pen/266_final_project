Heard you say
You lost your way
Through the constellation
I can guide you somewhere else
In the right direction
Don't listen to what they say
Super stars just flexing
Tune them out and come with me
We can get connected

Just look up
And follow
Your own star
There's nothing
You can't do

You're in this
Alone now
Just follow
Your own star

Everyone is occupied
With their own illusion
Might as well be in the sky
Away from all confusion
Hate and love will break your heart
Coming to a close tie
Angels arms can pull us from
The doubt that rots our insides

Just look up
And follow
Your own star
There's nothing
You can't do

You're in this
Alone now
Just follow
Your own star
