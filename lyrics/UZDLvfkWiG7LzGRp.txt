Aye, tell me, baby, have you ever seen a demon? Got you screamin'

Cruisin' in that foreign, drippin' red like it's bleedin'
Spanish bitch up on me and she tatted like she Lita.
Ride me like a Harley or your favorite two-seater.
Drop my life up on the ground like, fuck it, I don't need it.
Drop my life up on the ground like, fuck it, I don't need it.
Tell me, baby, have you ever seen a fucking demon? Got you screamin'.
Cruisin' in that rare.
Okay, like spit, water, choke, bitch, my life right here a joke
Wake up, no confidence, obviously, you know me though.
Feel the last tape was harder, why we out searchin' for Nirvana, uh?
Dyin' for conscious, stop it, what, you be in debt with no problem, mm
Stars in the sky, they alignin', yeah, my demons been my problems.
Bitch, I'm eight Backwoods to the
head, think we drown inside reality, agony.
Had me different, begged to differ,
hold up, like, diamonds can't make me smile.
But, yeah, that young nigga still got
that, still I tried, feelin' vibrant.
I was passed by, now, fuck, I'm nauseous,
got the weight of the world on my fuckin' back.
That's a fact for problems and commas,
Nail in the coffin, nigga,
get off me 'cause I had enough, drown in my sorrow until tomorrow.
