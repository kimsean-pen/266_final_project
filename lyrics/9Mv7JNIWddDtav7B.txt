Into a form
My skin will fade
After the storm
The white air stays

It covers the house
To keep them inside
The water sounds
As my feet glide

It ends right here if you go away
All your memories become an object
It ends right here if you go away
Like my father did; don't leave me crying

It ends right here if you go away
All your memories become an object
It ends right here if you go away
Like my father did; don't leave me crying

To be confined
I'm kept secure
What's happening
Is not to me

I'm out numbered
By those who feel
I wonder how
It's like to be real

It ends right here if you go away
All your memories become an object
It ends right here if you go away
Like my father did; don't leave me crying

It ends right here if you go away
All your memories become an object
It ends right here if you go away
Like my father did; don't leave me crying

It ends right here if you go away
All your memories become an object
It ends right here if you go away
Like my father did; don't leave me crying

It ends right here if you go away
All your memories become an object
It ends right here if you go away
Like my father did; don't leave me crying
