Well the sky broke in two
I found you dancing alone
Then the room filled up with you
And a song we both know
That's when you caught me with your eyes
Sending shivers down my spine
And then you whispered in my ear, you said
I can feel it too
And then you pulled me into you

Tonight, I got you where I want you
Closer I can tell you anything
You're the song that I sing
Tonight, let the music take us over
We'll fall in to forever, all is right
Cause I got you where I want you,
tonight
Through all of science and history
Well nothings ever stuck with me
But now I'm locked on to you
And I'm holding on to
The only thing I know
And now I'm never letting go

Tonight, tonight
The whole world could fall away
But you, and I
No we won't be afraid
Tonight
I got you where I want you
Closer I can tell you anything
