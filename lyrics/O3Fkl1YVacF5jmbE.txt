It's not the sin, this place
Not now
It seems like everyone is
Skipping town

But now you're gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
Auf wiedersehen
So long, so long, so long

I'd rather be anywhere but here
ANYWHERE BUT HERE
ANYWHERE BUT HERE
ANYWHERE BUT HERE

Without you

Said you had to leave
Said the city was killing
And so the smog
It got under your skin

But now you're gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
Auf wiedersehen
So long, so long, so long

I'd rather be anywhere but here
ANYWHERE BUT HERE
ANYWHERE BUT HERE
ANYWHERE BUT HERE

Oh, and you
Gonna get out of this dupm
Diamonds don't keep well in the rough
When, when you gonna get out of this dump?
Diamonds don't keep well in the rough

ANYWHERE BUT HERE
ANYWHERE BUT HERE
ANYWHERE BUT HERE
