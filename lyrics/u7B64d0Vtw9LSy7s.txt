Ooh I need your love babe
Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love babe
Just like I need you
Hold me
Love me
Hold me

Love me
Ain't got nothing but love babe
Eight days a week
Love you every day girl
Always on my mind
One thing I can say girl

Love you all-the-time

Hold me
Love me

Hold me
Love me

Ain't got nothing but love girl
Eight days a week
Eight days a week
I love you

Eight days a week
Is not enough to show I care
Ooh I need your love babe

Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love babe
Just like I need you
Oh, ho

Hold me
Love me
Hold me
Love me
Ain't got nothing but love babe
Eight days a week
Eight days a week
I love you
Eight days a week
Is not enough to show I care
Love you, every day, girl
Always on my mind
One thing I can say girl
Love you, all-the-time
Hold me
Love me
Hold me
Love me
Ain't got nothing but love babe
Eight days a week
Eight days a week
Eight days a week
