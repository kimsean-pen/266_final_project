I couldn't fight anymore
And I wouldn't lie anymore
All of the truths
That I couldn't ignore
I wouldn't fight in this war

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no crying
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no crying
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

I told myself I had to be a different someone
In order to win at a war I had already won
Yeah, I get it all from the saying I'll never give up
But look at me now
Yeah, look at me, I'm limitless
Look at me now
Yeah, look at me, I'm limitless

I am a woman who roars
Nobody opened my doors
I am a woman saying I want more
So give me what I'm asking for

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no crying
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

I told myself I had to be a different someone
In order to win at a war I had already won
Yeah, I get it all from the saying I'll never give up
But look at me now
Yeah, look at me, I'm limitless
Look at me now
Yeah, look at me, I'm limitless

I made it home
I made it known
I am here to stay
I made it home
I made it known
I am here to stay
I made it home

I told myself I had to be a different someone
In order to win at a war I had already won
Yeah, I get it all from the saying I'll never give up
But look at me now
Yeah, look at me, I'm limitless
Look at me now
Yeah, look at me, I'm limitless
