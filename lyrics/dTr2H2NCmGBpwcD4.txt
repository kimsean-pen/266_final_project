I knew these two people.
And, um... a boy and a girl,
And they liked to hang together.

They were nice people.
Um... they were the people,
That made you feel good
To be around.

Anyway, the thing was,
One day, they started acting
Kinda funny... kinda weird.

They started being seen,
Exchanging tokens of affection.
And there were rumors that they were,
Engaging in(?).

I think that they'd run out of time.

You know what happened to them?
You know what they do?
What they became?
