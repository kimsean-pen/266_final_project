Whatever happened here are people deranged
Deny evolution, reject climate change
In times of great concerns what will it take
A flood over Europe, a fist in the face or what?

It hurts my eyes to see you walking by yourself
And cover up that beautiful disguise
It hurts my eyes
No wonder if it's now and then too much for you
Abandon what they hardly recognize
It hurts my eyes, it hurts my eyes
It hurts my eyes, it hurts my eyes

On mornings like today it's pointless to go
Your dad left the table unable to stand
They said that was merely a figure of speech
You come to our city, prepare for the worst

It hurts my eyes to see you walking by yourself
And cover up that beautiful disguise
It hurts my eyes
Exposed but no one offers you a helping hand
Forgot what you already memorized
It hurts my eyes, it hurts my eyes
It hurts my eyes, it hurts my eyes
