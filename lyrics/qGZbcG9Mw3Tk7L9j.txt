"Okay, it's 3:17 AM. You're tuned in with your main man Tommy Inglethorpe. This next song's gonna keep you warm on a cold, cold night. So if you don't got a lover, just close your eyes. And listen, to Honne.

Like a rabbit in headlights
They're stunned by all your charm
And I feel so damn lucky
To have you on my arm

And I can't help but wonder
How we ended up alright
And I love you like no other
Cause this has never felt so right

Yeah you can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
Yeah you can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night

I want to treat you something special
Give you what you deserve
I want to take you to paradise
In a 1950's Merc

And I can't help but wonder
Just how we ended up alright
And I love you like no other
And this has never felt so right

You can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
Yeah you can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
Girl you can keep me warm

You can keep me real warm
There's just one thing

Girl you could have anyone
So why you choosing me and not leaving me on my own?
Girl you could be with anyone
So thanks for making me your number one

You can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
Yeah you can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night

Yeah wrap me up and keep warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
Oh yeah you can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
