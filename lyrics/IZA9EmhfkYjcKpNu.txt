Before my eyes - lies
nothing but lies
I cannot believe the scenes
taking place beneath our skies

It makes me wanna do my time
in a song or on the silver-screen
humanity is the biggest cancer
ever to be seen

Before my eyes - lies
civiliesation
ancient and wicked
destruction in creation

No matter how low you are
there's always someone to look down upon
and it goes
on and on

Emotionless - obscene
but a human life don't mean
anything to me
it's merely a seed of insanity
