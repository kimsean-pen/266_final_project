Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner, I don't care about everything
Out of control, I forgot to take my medicine
If I take this pill, that would be death of me
I am a disaster, I don't need a recipe
Tried to be sober, that didn't work for me
I don't know your name, please excuse my memory
Anti-social, get the fuck away from me
I got a problem

Rockstar life
I got the salts, I got the spice (vroom, vroom)

Fuck every night

And if she bad I hit it twice, yeah

(Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin')
Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
I got a problem nobody knows

Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner

Rollin' like a stoner
I got a problem nobody knows

One, two, three too many drinks, I think I might forget
How to count to ten, I tend to turn two shots into a fifth
I drive better when I'm drunk, I rock leather like a punk
Hennessy make me date Kennedys
I get to drunk to fuck
They say "Vic are you okay"?
Dude no way
I don't even know no more
I don't even blow no more, but I be leanin' like a cholo
Tony Hawk I go overboard, need to take it slow mo'

Your girl treat me like a polaroid, shake it for a photo
Swi-swi-swimming in alcohol
My, marco polo

Baby girl I am a loner, flyin' high and solo
Rollin' like a stoner, out of control
Cause I got a problem nobody knows

(Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin')

Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
I got a problem nobody knows

Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
I got a problem nobody knows

Pour another cup, yes
I can hear the voices, in my head
Tellin' me to jump off, of the edge
I got a problem, nobody knows
I got a problem, nobody knows
I got a problem, nobody knows
