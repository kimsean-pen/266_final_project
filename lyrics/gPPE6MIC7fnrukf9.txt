There ain't no way I'm gonna get any sleep
Sitting here knowing that I got in too deep
I don't know, she don't know
And we can't get it right

I been beating my head on the wall
Tired and frustrated, I got no one to call
I don't know, she don't know
But I can't make it right
And she can't get it right

It's a dead end ride
No one's gonna get out alive
When you're on a dead end ride
Give in your soul and your pride
Baby, it's a dead end ride

Don't like to compromise or say that I'm wrong
Throw in the towel, it's the same old song
When I don't know, she don't know
Then I can't make it right
And she won't get it right

It's a dead end ride
No one's gonna get out alive
When you're on a dead end ride
Give in your soul and your pride
Baby, it's a dead end ride

There ain't no screaming, only fear in the eyes
Wide awake or dreaming, yeah, you don't win a prize
Take it as it is and get the hell out of here
Put it in gear or you won't get anywhere

Then I can't make it right
And she won't get it right

It's a dead end ride
No one's gonna get out alive
When you're on a dead end ride
Give in your soul and your pride
Baby, it's a dead end ride
No one's gonna get out alive
When you're on a dead end ride
Give in your soul and your pride
Baby, it's a dead end ride
It's a dead end ride
Baby, it's a dead end ride
It's a dead end ride
