Smiled that kind of icy blue smile
Of a noonday reckoning
Tied together to
Tell-tale pictures
Sketched in sand castle plots and plans.
Similar starting points
Both for sin and shooting blanks
But it's always
The unseen sharp pang
The awkward rhythm of the dance
Like a tick-tock clock
In that heart of hearts...

Repeating (2x)
There is no happy here (8x)

Devil may care touches
Trickled down
Spine, thigh, and breast (4x)
May never
Truly
Illuminate
Illuminate the finer art of heartwork.

Devil may care touches
Trickled down
Spine, thigh, and breast (3x)
May never
Illuminate
Finer art
Heartwork
The finer art of heartwork

I was turning over
With the sheets
Facing your arched back
Thinking of how my eyes
Half-opened
Caught her arm
Moving from side to side
But never to me.
It's all connected
By blank words
To tell empty promises
Clumsy miscommunication.

So we say what we will
To see what we may
