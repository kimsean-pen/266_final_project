Here he comes with the HA-HA-HAS
That he gets from a bottle
To get at my soul
Take it to battle
And trample my dreams in the ground
Tear up my flowers
And scatter the petals around
Everlastingly yours

And he's standing in my way
But I'm not afraid
To reach down inside
There's something within me
That gives me the power to fight
To rip out his heart
And shatter his bones with a smile

There's nobody here (Nobody's here in this room)
Oh nobody's here (Nobody's here in this room)
Nobody's here
Ever escapes
With no blood on their hands
Oh nobody here
Ever escapes
With no blood on their hands

So he needs it in black and white
Maybe red in his colour
The summoning bells say welcome to hell
He trampled my soul in the ground
I'll take him to nowhere
And scatter his ashes around
Everlastingly yours

There's nobody here (Nobody's here in this room)
Oh nobody's here (Nobody's here in this room)
Nobody's here
Ever escapes
With no blood on their hands
Nobody's here
Ever escapes
With no blood on their hands
