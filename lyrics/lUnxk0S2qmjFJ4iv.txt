You're always scared I'm gonna leave
You're always scared that I'll start packing up my bags
While you're asleep and never come back
And never come back
And you're afraid you'll miss the signs
You try to pick up all the clues and things that build up over time
But it's not like that, it just isn't like that

And I know it always hits you late at night
When I'm working late and I'm not by your side, but

Don't listen to that voice
Darling, there's no need to be paranoid
Don't listen, it's just noise
Darling, don't be paranoid, yeah
Don't listen to that voice
Darling, there's no need to be paranoid
Don't listen, it's just noise
Darling, don't be paranoid, yeah

I know your past has messed you up
And you're still working out some issues
With the people that you love
But I'll be patient, you know that I'll be patient
'Cause I know that every time I don't pick up
That your mind starts wandering, you think too much, but

Don't listen to that voice
Darling, there's no need to be paranoid
Don't listen, it's just noise
Darling, don't be paranoid, yeah
Don't listen to that voice
Darling, there's no need to be paranoid
Don't listen, it's just noise
Darling, don't be paranoid, yeah

The thought that comes into your head
Only can make you upset if you let it
You don't have to make it worse
Think of this next time you're hurting
You deserve me, so

Don't listen to that voice
Darling, there's no need to be paranoid
(There's no need to be)
Don't listen, it's just noise
Darling, don't be paranoid, yeah
And I know it always hits you late at night
Don't listen to that voice
Darling, there's no need to be paranoid
When I'm working late and I'm not by your side, but
Don't listen, it's just noise
Darling, don't be paranoid, yeah

[Chorus]
Don't listen to that voice
Darling, there's no need to be paranoid
Don't listen, it's just noise
Darling, don't be paranoid, yeah
Don't listen to that voice
Darling, there's no need to be paranoid
Don't listen, it's just noise
Darling, don't be paranoid, yeah
Don't listen to that voice
Darling, there's no need to be paranoid
Don't listen, it's just noise
Darling, don't be paranoid, yeah
Don't listen to that voice
Darling, there's no need to be paranoid
Don't listen, it's just noise
Darling, don't be paranoid, yeah
