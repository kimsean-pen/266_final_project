Try to destroy me
I am a soldier
I am a riot
I am the new age
I am the liar
I am an idea
I am steadfast
I am present, future and past!

Like a forest burning
Time is running out
And the tides keep turning
I am here, I am now

Like a wave that's breaking
I will take you out
Try to destroy me, try to destroy me

Go!

Try to destroy me!

As much as you hold me, I will escape
Everything that you told me, I will change
Don't think you can rule me, I am a rock
Your words can't control me, It's only just struck

Like a forest burning
Time is running out
And the tides keep turning
I am here, I am now

You are a jokester
You aren't dying
Bring out the old days
The flames are rising
A burning empire
Is all I need
There is no truth in a fire
Burn so passionate

Tear me up
Don't make a difference at all
Take me down
Don't make a difference at all
Tear me up
(Don't make a difference)

Like a forest burning
Time is running out
And the tide keeps turning
I am here, I am now

Like a wave that's breaking
I will take you out
Try to destroy me
Try to destroy me

I am a soldier
I am a riot
I am the new age
I am the liar
I am an idea
I am steadfast
I am present, future and past!

Try to destroy me (Try to destroy me)
Try to destroy me (Try to destroy me)
Try to destroy me (Try to destroy me)
Try to destroy me!
