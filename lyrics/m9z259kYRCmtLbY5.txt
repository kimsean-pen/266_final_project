In the summertime we get way too high we don't think
Drugs on your mind and it's all in the sink
Cup full of liquor so it's hard not to drink
Girls on my line tryna fuck tryna fuck

Fuck love, it get harder to believe when she leave
Lust, he just looking for a bust and he leave
She a feen, do it all for the drugs that she need
You a Queen you don't need to be like her to succeed
I know it hurt every night you don't sleep for a week
You don't eat gotta smoke some weed just so you can sleep
In your dreams everything is real nothing's what it seems
Life's a trip more than we can see more than we believe

In the summertime we get way too high we don't think
Drugs on your mind and it's all in the sink
Cup full of liquor so it's hard not to drink
Girls on my line tryna fuck tryna fuck

Fuck outta my face I don't got time
Please don't say I'm yours If you're not mine
Tired of this shit I don't wanna cry
3 hands in the sky [?]
Codeine turning into pink
Pills on the bathroom sink
Gain the world, lose your soul
You love the watch, lose control

In the summertime we get way too high we don't think
Drugs on your mind and it's all in the sink
Cup full of liquor so it's hard not to drink
Girls on my line tryna fuck tryna fuck

Crush a bit, lil bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feeling lit, feeling like 2am summer night (yuh)
Drunk as fuck, Hope the cops don't pull us over
We got all these drugs in our system
How you think we suppose to numb the pain
In this generation everybody want the fame
How you think they keep up to the image that they claim
Buy a diamond chain that just seem to
numb the pain nothing else would be the same
