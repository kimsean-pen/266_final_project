The invention of the ship
Was the invention of the shipwreck
I tried to find out who I was
By jumping off the deck

I intentionally clipped the intervention like a trip wire
Picked a color tried to bribe the bad one back into his bed

And I don't, won't
I don't, Choose You
You

Underneath the Christian Court there was this saying in the bricks
That you don't determine greatness by a man's intelligence
No you won't determine greatness til you really start to dig
And you find out all those empty things that he lets discourage him

And I don't, I won't
I don't Choose
And I don't, I won't
I don't Choose you

I tried to walk away
You broke the cast and tried to say
"I am not the man you kill
I am not the man you choose"

See it back to back aways today
I tried to clean you tried to pray
"I am not the man you kill
I am not the man you Choose"

And I don't, won't
I don't Choose
And I don't, I won't
I don't Choose You
You
