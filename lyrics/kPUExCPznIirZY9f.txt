Hey, your glass is empty
It's a hell of a long way home
Why don't you let me take you?
It's no good to go alone

I never would have opened up
But you seemed so real to me
And after all the bullshit I've heard
Refreshing not to see
That I don't have to pretend
She doesn't expect it from me

So, don't tell me I
Haven't been good to you
Don't tell me I
Have never been there for you
Just tell me why
Nothing is good enough

Hey little girl, would you like some candy?
Your Momma said it's okay
The door is open, come on outside
No, I can't come out today

It's not the wind that cracked your shoulder
And threw you to the ground
Who's there that makes you so afraid?
You're shaken to the bone
And no, I don't understand
You deserve so much more than this

So, don't tell me why
He's never been good to you
Don't tell me why
He's never been there for you
Don't you know that why
It's simply not good enough

Oh, so just let me try
I will be good to you
Just let me try
And I will be there for you
I'll show you why
You're so much more than
Good enough

So, don't tell me why
He's never been good to you
Don't tell me why
He's never been there for you
Don't you know that why
It's simply not good enough

Oh, so just let me try
I will be good to you
Just let me try
And I will be there for you
I'll show you why
You're so much more than
Good enough
