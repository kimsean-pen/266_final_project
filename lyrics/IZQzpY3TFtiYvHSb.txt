my fridge ain't broken
my beer ain't cold
my bodies achin and I'm not even old
police start comin but I did nothin wrong
I sit here singin but I don't have a song

never had much, grew up with nothin
but the music always was somethin
been down and out
I've been on top of the world
a world that keeps on spinning on a turntable

don't have a room but I'm not homeless
I'm filled with doubt but I'm not hopeless
the stakes are up, but I got nothin at stake
got a wounded heart but it won't break

never had much, grew up with nothin
but the music always was somethin
been down and out, I've been on top of the world
a world that keeps on spinning on a turntable

ooooooo ah ooooooo
on a turntable
ooooooo ah ooooooo
on a turntable
ooooooo ah ooooooo
on a turntable
ooooooo ah ooooooo

traveled the world but I've been no where
all I do is worry, but I got no cares
and I drink too much but I still feel sober
this record plays
over and over

never had much, grew up with nothin
but the music always was somethin
been down and out
I've been on top of the world
a world that keeps on spinning on a turntable

ooooooo ah ooooooo
on a turntable
ooooooo ah ooooooo
on a turntable
ooooooo ah ooooooo
on a turntable
ooooooo ah ooooooo

I keep on spinnin
