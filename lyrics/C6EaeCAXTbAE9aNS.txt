I'll break you down
I'll take you down down
Fill you with sadness
Make your life madness

I'm having a hard time
I'm making you do the hard time too
I'm stuck in a bad way
And I'm gonna make you pay for it

Give me a mile
I'll take a hundred miles
Such a mistake
Sorry you made

I'm having a hard time
I'm making you do the hard time too
I'm stuck in a bad way
And I'm gonna make you pay for it

I'm having a hard time
I'm making you do the hard time too
I'm stuck in a bad way
And I'm gonna make you pay for it

I'm having a hard time
I'm making you do the hard time too
I'm stuck in a bad way
And I'm gonna make you pay for it

I know you're here
I know you're gone
I never asked you to stay
I'm waking up baby now tell me are you okay?
