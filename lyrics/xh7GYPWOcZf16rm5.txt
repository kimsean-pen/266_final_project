Kill the lights

Hello ladies and gentlemen
I'm glad you've graced me with your presence
You're in time to see me wrestle with my conscience
Staring into the si-si-silence

You see I came to save the stage
I hope I'm not too late
Passion called from back
Behind the curtain screaming

"Sonny, this is urgent
Fill these 50 voices with a purpose
But don't just give it away
Inspiration isn't cheap these days
You better make them earn it"

You better
Make them earn it
Make them earn it

You better
Make them earn it
Make them earn it
