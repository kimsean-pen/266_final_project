Turn up the music
and dream down the rain
Find love any lucid
No, things, won't never be the same again

There's a hole in the sky
There's a heart open wide
For a little while, it could fly
Here's to hoping that I would be ok
'Cause I know it's a beautiful life
A beautiful life
A beautiful life

Free would be drifting on
Just let the wave crash into you
Somehow we'll make it own
Underneath the sky, we're bleeding blue

There's a hole in the sky
There's a heart open wide
For a little while it could fly
Here's to hoping that I would be ok
'Cause I know it's a beautiful life
A beautiful life
A beautiful life

Come undone
Carry on
No more waiting, yeah ah
And begin to let go

If you hear
What I hear
We'll be alright
In a life full of life
Just let go

It's a beautiful life

Come undone
Carry on
No more waiting, yeah ah
And begin to let go

If you hear
What I hear
We'll be alright
In a life full of life
Just let go

A beautiful life
