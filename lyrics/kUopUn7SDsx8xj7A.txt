Floating down, I'm weightless
Finding other places I haven't know before
If you want some more
Come on and tell me, baby

Let me know
I don't wanna see you
Let me know
I don't wanna see you go
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da

Be my one and only
Before you leave me lonely
If you want my heart, tell me from the start
I really gotta know it

Let me know
I don't wanna see you
Let me know
I don't wanna see you go
(Let me know)

I don't wanna see you
I don't wanna see you
I don't wanna see you
Doesn't matter anyway
(Let me know)
You didn't break my heart, two-month scar
Gotta let me know
Come on, let me know, don't let me go
I don't wanna see you go
I don't wanna see you go
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da
