now I lay me down to sleep
I pray my soul to keep
if I die before I wake
I pray my soul to take

come on in
come on in
take me home tonight

now in perfect peace I rest/now I lay me down to sleep
in full salvation blest/I pray my soul to keep
for thy grace that keeps me still/if I die before I wake
safe from every ill/I pray my soul to take

come on in
come on in
take me home tonight

come on in
come on in
take me home tonight

now in perfect peace I rest/now I lay me down to sleep
in full salvation blest/I pray my soul to keep
for thy grace that keeps me still/if I die before I wake
safe from every ill/I pray my soul to take
