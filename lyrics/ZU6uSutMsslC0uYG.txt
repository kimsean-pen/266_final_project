This edict dictates
The mind will stay in a creative state
I'm not a scholar but I'm pretty sure
You've earned the right to keep creating

I cannot breathe
I cannot speak
Please let me leave or let me sleep
There's no leaving here
Never

Please tell me the benefits of keeping me locked up
Maybe if we tried hard working together
We'd escape insanity forever and ever

I took a look outside my window
I painted wings and tried to fly
Closed my eyes and I jumped
Imagination ran dry
Took a look outside my window
I painted wings and tried to fly
Break me out of this fictitious life

This edict dictates
The mind will stay in a creative state
I'm not a scholar but I'm pretty sure
Don't let me die like this

What else can I paint when I'm watching the skyline?
What is this crimson? Blood is much redder
Please expand this room

I'm just waiting here
I'm just pacing here
I'm just wasting here

I took a look outside my window
I painted wings and tried to fly
Closed my eyes and I jumped
Imagination ran dry
Took a look outside my window
I painted wings and tried to fly
Break me out of this fictitious life

I'm just waiting here
I'm just pacing here
I'm just wasting here

I took a look outside my window
I painted wings and tried to fly
Closed my eyes and I jumped
Imagination ran dry
Took a look outside my window
I painted wings and tried to fly
Break me out of this fictitious life
