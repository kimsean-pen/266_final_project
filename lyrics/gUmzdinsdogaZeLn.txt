I like to dance under streetlights
And walk up on the clouds
I like to shout from the rooftops
And surf on top of the crowd
For many years, many years
I was scared of the person I was
And I'm not perfect they say
But I know that I was born to be loved

Hey, hey, hey
Will they love me now?

Hey now, kid, you're my salvation
Just put it all out
Don't let your head down
All my life, they never told me
They never said that it'd ever be so hard

I like to spend all my money
On things that I don't need
I like to sleep all the day
'Cause this life is easier in dreams
Yeah, in my dreams, in my dreams
Well, I think about the places I have been
I can't regret what I have done
It's the past that makes me who I am

Hey, hey, hey
Will they love me now?

Hey now, kid, you're my salvation
Just put it all out
Don't let your head down
All my life, they never told me
They never said that it'd ever be so hard

Even when the sun goes down
I'll be there to hold and love you
Even when the day is done
I will be the one you can run to
Even when I'm dead and gone
I will always watch out for you now
And 'til the day we meet again
And 'til we meet again

Hey now, kid, you're my salvation
Just put it all out
Don't let your head down
All my life, they never told me
They never said that it'd ever be so hard
They never said that it'd ever be so hard
