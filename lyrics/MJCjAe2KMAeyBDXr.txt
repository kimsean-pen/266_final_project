Lay down, lay down
No more running round
Sleep away the morning hours
Lay down, lay down
Sparrow sing, ears ring
My baby doesn't hear a thing
Work that long old night away
Lay down sleep another day
Lay down, lay down
No more running round
Sleep away the morning hours
Lay down, lay down
Every muscle, vein and bone
Answers to that endless drone
I can hear my old machine
Still running even in my dreams
Lay down, lay down
No more running round
Sleep away the morning hours
Lay down, lay down
