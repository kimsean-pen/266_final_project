You've got control, learnt ably the principles
The bigger always devour the small
Never a servant
Acting more like demigod!
Exposed power led you to the throne
Vulnerable minds - Weak ones assert you on!
Bloodstained ties strengthens your name
Made them feel afraid
Afraid of death!
Feed them with fear like you feed them with bread!

DEATH sets the value on this world!
Religion's price
Authorities
Taste of flesh
Death is our favourite dope!

You waste life to reach higher and higher
Feeling immortal
The man who'll never expire!
Remember, time is the reaper
It will bury us all!
The hooded end and nothing more than a fragile body and mortal soul!
Hourglass of a hundred years
Everything turns into ash!
All your Empires will fall
With the last of the rotten cells
What is your heritage?

DEATH sets the value on this world!
Religion's price
Authorities
Taste of flesh
Death is our favourite dope!

Mother of life
Mother of pain
The birth of chaos
The harmony of fate
The fatal blood
The bond we can't avoid!
Search for the aeons lost in her name
The doomed game but worth the show
Begins her dance
Let the darts be thrown!
The worship of life drives the destiny's course
The cult of death kills the remorse!!!
