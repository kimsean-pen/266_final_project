I never wondered why I made a home in my head
Save the know I'm doing fine inside instead
Share a city only if the rest are offered too
I never wonder why my favorite places feel like you
I never wonder why my favorite places feel like you
Mmm
Buried in America, England pulled the sheet
Half an hour drive a couple miles down the street
Wonder what'll leave me if I miss the train at two
But I never wonder why my favorite places feel like you
I never wonder why my favorite places feel like you
Mmm
To put it lightly, I think I just might be
The worst at making a decision I'm proud of
Give me just a couple good looks back
To scratch my collar I know I'm not your father
And I know it's not your fault
You don't have to say it
You don't have to rub it in
Mmm
Got lost in the city you were on your way to bed
Thank the lord it's finally raining, god I wish I wasn't wet
Sure I'll stay a minute, swear I'm only passing through
I never wonder why my favorite places feel like you
I never wonder why my favorite places feel like you
Mmm
