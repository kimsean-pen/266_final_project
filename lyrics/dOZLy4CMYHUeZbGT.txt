We're drunk on love
So turn the music up
I wanna lose control
We're gonna lose control
We're going out tonight
Going with no invite
I want to take it all
We're gonna take it all

I'm a lover not a hater
Not a fighter or a player
And I'll party til the sun comes up
Getting a hangover without a cure
We could end up anywhere but that's all part of the rush

When the lights are shining that's where you will find me
Getting drunk on love
That's what we do
When I see you dancing
Gets me so excited, girl
I pour my love all over you

We're drunk on love
We're drunk on love

We're drunk on love
We're gonna light it up
The fire never ends
This fire never ends
And when tomorrow comes
We're gonna hear those drums
We'll do it all again
Let's do it all again

I'm a lover not a hater
Not a fighter or a player
And I'll party til the sun comes up
Getting a hangover without a cure
We could end up anywhere but that's all part of the rush

When the lights are shining that's where you will find me
Getting drunk on love
That's what we do
When I see you dancing
Gets me so excited, girl
I pour my love all over you

We're drunk on love
We're drunk on love

When the lights are shining that's where you will find me
Getting drunk on love
That's what we do
When I see you dancing
Gets me so excited, girl
I pour my love all over you
When the lights are shining that's where you will find me
Getting drunk on love
That's what we do
When I see you dancing
Gets me so excited, girl
I pour my love all over you
We're drunk on love
We're drunk on love
