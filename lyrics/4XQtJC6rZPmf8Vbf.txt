Come with me
Into the trees
We'll lay on the grass
And let hours pass

Take my hand
Come back to the land
Let's get away
Just for one day

Let me see you stripped
Let me see you stripped

Metropolis
Has nothing but this
You breath in the fumes
I taste what we kiss

Take my hand
Come back to the land
Where everything's ours
For a few hours

Let me see you stripped
Let me see you stripped

Let me hear you make decisions
Without your television
Let me hear you speaking
Just for me

Let me see you stripped
Let me see you stripped

Let me hear you make decisions
Without your television
Let me hear you speaking
Just for me
Let me see you stripped
Let me see you stripped
Let me see you stripped
Let me see you stripped
