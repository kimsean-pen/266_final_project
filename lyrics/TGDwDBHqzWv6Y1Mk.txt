It's so familiar to me
A gun in your hand, a hole in my chest
And now you strike a match and inhale
It's now to the point where it's all so routine
The anchor's up, your ship has been sailed

Close your eyes to fight
The demons deep within your mind
Satisfy your worst intentions
I'm your sacrifice

Dressing yourself up to kill
You do this for peace, you do this for love
But you know there has to be loss
Lives torn apart as you've hit your mark
You'll take your share at anyone's cost

Close your eyes to fight
The demons deep within your mind
Satisfy your worst intentions
I'm your sacrifice

The metal is cold to lift and to hold
But now my heart feels the warm undertow
I cannot breathe the way I feel about you suffocates
I will not speak the words I feel about you go to waste

I will lay here until my body washes up on shore
I'll sacrifice with everything I believed in before
I'll get back up and do it again

Close your eyes to fight
The demons deep within your mind
Satisfy your worst intentions
I'm your sacrifice
