Imagine driving down the one lane road
Down by the chapel we could be alone
And with the rain there's nowhere else to go
We'll watch it fall
Don't try and tell me you don't want to see
What it would be like to grow old with me

You're in love every other day
Cause you smile at me like you're dying to say
That your heart beat stops when I'm walking away
So don't walk away
You're in love
Every other day you're in love

Imagine drinking wine in Sicily
And you'll be kissing me on New Year's Eve
Nothing but cobblestone and red brick streets
You'd like the cold
Just tell me what it is that's holding you back
If we get lost we'll follow old train tracks

You're in love every other day
Cause you smile at me like you're dying to say
That your heart beat stops when I'm walking away
So don't walk away
You're in love
You're in love when you're holding me tight
But you're out of love when we're saying goodnight
And you don't know why I make you feel so right
But it feels right
You're in love
Every other day you're in love

Imagine you and me
And how beautiful we could be
Yeah

You're in love every other day
Cause you smile at me like you're dying to say
That your heart beat stops when I'm walking away
So don't walk away
You're in love
You're in love when you're holding me tight
But you're out of love when we're saying goodnight
And you don't know why I make you feel so right
But it feels right
You're in love
But it feels right
You're in love
But it feels right
You're in love
