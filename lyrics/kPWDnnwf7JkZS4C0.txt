When times are down, you know I'll be with you
Your times are up, it's time I see you too
All this bullshit drama I can see right through
Everybody wants something they can't have
So they're gonna put it on you

Wherever you go, yeah, you can take me there
Over the ocean, I can see us there
Let's run away, and be forever young
We'll catch the sun, where there's no need to run
Wherever you go, yeah you can take me there

Yeah, you can take me there

Yeah, you can take me there
Yeah, you can take me there

I see you, and you see me too
We may be broke, but we see the truth
All this bullshit drama I can see right through
Everybody wants something they can't have
So they're gonna put it on you

Wherever you go, yeah, you can take me there
Over the ocean, I can see us there
Let's run away, and be forever young
We'll catch the sun, where there's no need to run
Wherever you go, yeah you can take me there

Yeah, you can take me there

Yeah, you can take me there
Yeah, you can take me there
