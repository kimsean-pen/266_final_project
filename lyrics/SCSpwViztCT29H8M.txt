See the world from afar
Like dust from a star
Seduced by the sun
Will we ever find out who we are?
Fading into space
And Something is grabbing me

Spinning violently out of control
Just can't get a hold
Slowly pulling into the unknown

Cause I can't believe
This is happening to me
Another chance
For me to see infinity
The past is gone
I can feel it moving on
Another chance for me to start again
Moving through the event horizon

Into the abyss
There's much more than this
I am ready so take me
Take me into the nexus

Spinning violently out of control
Just can't get a hold
Slowly falling into the unknown

Cause I can't believe
This is happening to me
Another chance
For me to see infinity
The past is gone
I can feel it moving on
Another chance for me to start again
Moving through the event horizon
Moving through the event horizon
The event, the event horizon

Now I'm not afraid of the unknown

Cause I can't believe
This is happening to me
Another chance
For me to see infinity
The past is gone
I can feel it moving on
Another chance for me to start again
Moving through the event horizon
Moving through the event, the event horizon
