They bathe their limbs in transient guard
(They) take refuge in commune
With tooth and nail
This great ordeal
Is placed on square rigging
Like shining a candle at the sun
Not much harm will be done
Like drinking a wall
It's unlikely
Yet my stomach is weighed down by bricks

An animal
An animal
Called to the witness stand
A test of faith against all odds
On the book it lays it's hand
I solemnly swear to tell the truth
And nothing but the truth
So help me god, as I stand aloof
And thorns are nagging at my neck

In the lion's den
Do they still bite after you?
Do they still chase after you?
Come on in
In that lion's den
They never cared too much for you
They never took great care of you
Come on in
Just come on in
Come on in
Come on in

Blockheads and fools have it better than you
It's easy to forget that
While they fumble around
For a bona fide life
Their rents are payed by family members
Like shining a candle at the sun
Not much harm will be done
Like drinking a wall
It's unlikely
Yet my stomach is weighed down by bricks

In the lion's den
Do they still bite after you?
Do they still chase after you?
Come on in
In that lion's den
They never cared too much for you
They never took great care of you
Come on in
Just come on in
Come on in
Come on in
