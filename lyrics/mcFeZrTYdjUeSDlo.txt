White lies, but they're getting dark
Blurred lines, but they're getting clearer
Just tell the truth, ay, it's not that hard
You call me crazy
So am I crazy?
Your words don't hold any weight
I can't seem to get a straight answer
Don't trust you, but who's to blame?
I think you're crazy
But am I crazy?

Got me second guessin' everything you say
Thinkin' that I know you, but you're really a stranger
Doin' what you gotta do to get your way
You're reckless and selfish and you can't help it

Say you're talkin' to me honestly
But you're lyin' to me constantly, oh
All the bullshit, I don't need it
And honestly, I don't believe it, nah
Say you're talkin' to me honestly
But I don't want your dumb apology, no
Say you're sorry, you don't mean it
Sorry that I don't believe it, nah

Say too much, but it's not enough
Got me wonderin', 'what all are you hiding?'
Did you lie when you called it love?
Or am I crazy?
Somebody save me

Got me second guessin' everything you say
Thinkin' that I know you, but you're really a stranger
Doin' what you gotta do to get your way
You're reckless and selfish and you can't help it

Say you're talkin' to me honestly
But you're lyin' to me constantly, oh
All the bullshit, I don't need it
And honestly, I don't believe it, nah
Say you're talkin' to me honestly
But I don't want your dumb apology, no
Say you're sorry, you don't mean it
Sorry that I don't believe it, nah

Don't know what's reality
Made me question my sanity, oh
Don't know what's reality
Am I losing my sanity?

Say you're talkin' to me honestly
But you're lyin' to me constantly, oh
All the bullshit, I don't need it
And honestly, I don't believe it, nah
Say you're talkin' to me honestly
But I don't want your dumb apology, no
Say you're sorry, you don't mean it
Sorry that I don't believe it, nah
Say you're talkin' to me honestly (I don't need it)
But you're lyin' to me constantly (I don't believe it, no)
Say you're talkin' to me honestly (I don't need it)
But you're lyin' to me constantly (I don't believe it, no)
(Say you're talkin' to me honestly
But you're lyin' to me constantly
Say you're talkin' to me honestly
But you're lyin' to me constantly, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
