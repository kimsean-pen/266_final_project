Unleash the wolves
Carnage has no rules
Comparison, competition
We'll bury one and all

Look in the eyes of rage
A loyalty bred of suffering
The fire inside it burns eternally, victory
Look in the eyes of pain
The scars on our souls forever remain
Calling the sheltered of the broken wing
Join the fray

Bury our rivals
Shotguns, knives, rifles

A family of the unwanted, beaten, stunted, dysfunction
A brotherhood that is of violence and to tyrants, bow to none

Unleash the wolves
Carnage has no rules
Comparison, competition
We'll bury one and all

Look in the eyes of hate
A circle of hell they come to pray
United against all that come threatening
Lay to waste
Look in the eyes of the free
Bound to each other's longevity
Guarding the backs of apha's dignity, savagely

Bury our rivals
Shotguns, knives, rifles

A family of the unwanted, beaten, stunted, dysfunction
A brotherhood that is of violence and to tyrants, bow to none

Unleash the wolves
Carnage has no rules
Comparison, competition
We'll bury one and all

Come closer, walk with me in hell
Dear rival, fear in you I smell
A fist to face is all fair game now
The pack attacking, the sacrificial pray for the preyers

Reaping the sour seeds of death's bread
In tooth and claw the scent of the dead

Come closer, walk with me in hell
Oh rival, fear in you I smell
A fist to face is all fair game now
The pack attacking, the sacrificial pray for the preyers

War, that far one
Spreading our population far across the land
Loving to fornicate, respecting the command
Rally the warriors, tally the score
In every victory is solace but there's no satisfaction
No satisfaction
There is no satisfaction
There is no satisfaction
And there never will be

Bury our rivals
Shotguns, knives, rifles

A family of the unwanted, beaten, stunted, dysfunction
A brotherhood that is of violence and to tyrants, bow to none
A family of the unwanted, beaten, stunted, dysfunction
A brotherhood that is of violence and we fail to die

Unleash the wolves
Carnage has no rules
Comparison, competition
We'll bury one and all
Unleash the wolves
Carnage has no rules now
The night will fall
Beware the call
Dominate all
