Vengeance provoked
Behold the mark of Cain
Uncreate the genesis
Devoured by the abyss

Cleave the covenant
And powers that grant
Bury the testament
Tumbled by torment

Nocturnal
Infernal
The suffering eternal
Soaking the rays of celestial
Light
Noctiluca

Profane
Arcane
Benediction of bane
Falling through cracks of
Darkness
Obumbration

Kingdoms quake
Mountains move
Skies collapse
Sulphur descending
Suns eclipse
Seas overflow
End of days
Hades arising

The father
Son and the holy ghost
Tridents penetrate
Steel and flesh conjugate
Vaporize the spirits of distress
Sabaoth of legions
Redder the regions

Time in reverse
The god heads rear
The blood divine splattered on the three-pronged spear
The dagger of night
Hearts stabbed and cloaked
The banishing of the fallen one has been revoked

Bury the testament
Tumbled by torment

Kingdoms quake
Mountains move
Skies collapse
Sulphur descending
Suns eclipse
Seas overflow
End of days
Hades arising

Hades arising

Time in reverse
The god heads rear
The blood divine splattered on the three-pronged spear
The dagger of night
Hearts stabbed and cloaked
