Young love waits at the window
And I said go home
'Cause he don't know it's not his problem
And he don't know I'm not alone

Clock strikes 3 in the morning
And I lie sleepless
'Cause he don't know I broke my promise
And he don't know I've done this

In the early light
I found you with a bottle by the side
I can see by your eyes you know that I
I'm kissing you goodbye
I'm kissing you goodbye

What now?
That is the question
But it's not up to you
So I think I will leave you guessing
After all you put me through

In the early light
I found you with a bottle by the side
I can see by your eyes you know that I
I'm kissing you goodbye
I'm kissing you goodbye
I'm kissing you goodbye

In the early light
I found you with a bottle by the side
I can see by your eyes you know that I
I'm kissing you goodbye
I'm kissing you goodbye
I'm kissing you goodbye
