Take a trip to Anorak City
All the girls are young and so pretty,
And the boys all walking around,
They're all really groovy in Anorak Town
Take a trip to Anorak Station
There's a craze that's sweeping the nation
So don'y let your credibility slip
Let's all take a trip to Anorak City.
Take a walk down Anorak High Street,
Say "hello" to the people that I meet
I wanna be just like them, 'cause everyone you talk to acts just like a friend
Will you be my anorak, baby?
Come on honey, please don't say maybe
Say you will forever be mine
We'll stay until the end of time in Anorak City
