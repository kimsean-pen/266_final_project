I've got a picture of your house
And you're standing by the door.
It's black and white and faded
And it's looking pretty worn.
See the factory that I worked
Silhouetted in the back.
The memories are gray but man they're really coming back.
I don't need to be the king of the world
As long as i'm the hero of this little girl
Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it everyday
No matter what your friends might say
How I love the way you move
And the sparkle in your eyes
There's a color deep inside them
Like blue suburban skys
When I come home late at night
And you're in bed asleep
I wrap my arms around you
So I can feel you breathe
I don't need to be a superman
As long as you will always be my biggest fan
Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it everyday
No matter what your friends might say
We'll find our way
Now the lights are going out
Along the boulevard
Memories come rushing back and makes it pretty hard
I've got nowhere left to go
And no one really cares
I don't know what to do
But I'm never giving up on you
Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends might say yeah
I find a way
Heaven
Whoah, oohh, ohhh
Whoah, oohh, ohhh
Heaven
Whoah, oohh, ohhh
Heaven
It's not too far away
Yeah yeah
It's not too far away
It's not too far away
It's not too far away
It's not too far away
