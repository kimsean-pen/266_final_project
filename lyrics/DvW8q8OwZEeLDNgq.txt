her eyes could have only been born of this ocean
delph blue, longing and weepy
they want me so much to want you
all wrapped up beside you and winded
after you've taken me
my minds' roamin' free
dozin' dazin' driftin' out of this evening

with a verse so sweetly sung
to a world we've longed to come
but somehow we are not one

and all her lavender meadows, so fragrant and beautiful
and at your dining room table
the sun falls on my face so warm
and all the turbulent highways
ive taken to get here
to you in this home in this moment
for that i am greatful

though this house feels like an old lost song
that calls for me to play along
somehow i dont belong

the night lit by moon, the day sun
oh baby im wondering how come
the light is nearly gone

her soul could have only been born of a wild oak
so far reachin' and swayin' and free
but stands stoically alone
when the skies come apart
she leans over so helpless and cowering
until the storms come to cease
and somehow she's the only one standing

and though we've grown so close my love
and though these nights we've shared so many of
a part of me is numb

her eyes look up to me so open and true
our window's in perfect clear view
that somehow i cant see through
