In a perfect world
Of my own design
I'd get rid of the sun
In favor of the moonshine

And if the natural order
Were mine to define
The light in the tunnel
Would be a neon sign

'Cause I've always thought the nighttime
It feels like mine
If it were only up to me
The sun would never ever shine

Well the moon's invitation
It's gentle and it's kind
And it leaves everyone alone
And to me that is divine

With its mightiest demonstration
I feel so much less confined
And towards that kind of light
I will always be inclined

'Cause I've always thought the nighttime
It feels like mine
If it were only up to me
The sun would never ever shine

If I could go out on a limb
And make so bold a leap
I'd tell you, sun
To go down
And sink into the deep

'Cause I've always thought the nighttime
It feels like mine
If it were only up to me
The sun would never ever shine
