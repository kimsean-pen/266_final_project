I love this place
But it's haunted without you
My tired heart
Is beating so slow
Our hearts sing less
Than we wanted
We wanted
Our hearts sing 'cause
We do not know
We do not know

To light the night
To help us grow
To help us grow
It is not said
I always know

You can catch me
Don't you run
Don't you run
If you live another day
In this happy little house
The fire's here to stay

To light the night
To help us grow
To help us grow
It is not said
I always know

Please don't make a fuss
It won't go away
The wonder of it all
The wonder that I made
I am here to stay
I am here to stay
Stay
