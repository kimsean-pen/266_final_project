Lying in my bed
I hear the clock ticking and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new

Flash back, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after some times you pictured me

I'm walking too far ahead, you're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you said, go slow, I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

Time after time
