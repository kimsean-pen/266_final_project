It's not time to give this one more try, I don't think so
Last night you said you want a last lie
I can't let you wreck my plans
I'm planning to let you go

Oh, Only one thing is true, only one thing to do

Time to, delete you
Burning up all your pictures

Tearing up all your letters
Ripping up all your sweaters
This is, this is
For the better
Slashing up all your tires

Smashing up all your flowers
Grabbing back all my power
'Cause one mess says I don't need you
Delete you

Oh, oh delete you
Whoa oh oh

It's not time to say how much you care, I don't think so
I don't want you, I want you not there

I'm done I think that the time's come
To bring this thing to an end
I think this could be goodbye, I think you've run out of time

Time to, delete you
Burning up all your pictures
Tearing up all your letters
Ripping up all your sweaters
This is, this is
For the better
Slashing up all your tires
Smashing up all your flowers
Grabbing back all my power
'Cause one mess says I don't need you
Delete you
All I want from you is for you to disappear

All I need from you is for you to not be here
I guess it's time you got the news
Gonna replace you, erase you
Delete you, Delete you
Oh, oh delete you
Whoa oh oh, oh delete you
Burning up all your pictures
Tearing up all your letters
Ripping up all your sweaters
This is, this is
For the better
Slashing up all your tires
Smashing up all your flowers
Grabbing back all my power
'Cause one mess says I don't need you
Delete you
Oh, oh delete you
Whoa oh oh, oh delete you
Time to delete you
Whoa oh, delete you
