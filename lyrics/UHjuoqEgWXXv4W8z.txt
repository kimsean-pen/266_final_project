My darling, since you left me
Where can you be? Nobody knows now
I'm just a little lonely, but
Know that, love

I'm gonna be coming home (coming home)
Coming home (coming home)
Coming home (coming home)
I'm coming home

I'm coming back to you (to you)
Oh, baby, baby, baby
Please

Let me tell you something
I've seen so many hard times
Just about every place I go
But there will be no more hard times

No, no, no, no
I'm gonna be coming home (coming home)
Coming home (coming home)
Coming home (coming home)

I'm coming home
I'm coming back to you (to you)

Oh, darling, darling, darling, darling

Let me come
Darling, where can you be?
Please, somebody gotta know
My darling, where can you be?
Please, somebody gotta know
I'm gonna be coming home (coming home)
Coming home (coming home)
Coming home (coming home)
I'm coming home
I'm coming back to you (to you)

Oh, my, my, my, my little darling
I wanna just come back to you
Please, I'm begging with tears in my eyes
Let me come back to you
Oh, baby, baby
Baby...
Coming home (coming home)
I'm coming home (coming home)
I'm coming home (coming home)
I'm coming home
I'm coming back to you (to you)

Baby, I'm giving you all the soul that I have
I'm singing to you
And I want you to come back to me
Please, baby
Darling, let me come home back to you
Oh, lil' lil' baby
Let me come back to you
Mmmhmm
I love you, my darling
And I want you
Ay, baby, baby, baby
Please, just let me come home back to you
Oh, my, my, my
And it's so
I said I wanna come back to you
