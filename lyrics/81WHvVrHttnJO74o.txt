Show me what it is you've done
Pull the covers off in front of everyone
Sure you want us all to see
What you created for yourself in spite of me

You can try to tie me down
You can try to string me up
But you have no luck now

Please don't ever let me down again
It shouldn't be allowed
Please don't ever make me frown again
You have shown me how

Please don't try to be my friend again
'Cause I don't want you
I don't want you now
I don't want you now

So now you learned to make your bed
Far be it for me to be the one to pay your head
The truth is you know I could have pulled you up
But you'd already advertised that I had slashed the tires
Of your one man show

You can try to tie me down
You can try to stitch me up
But you have no luck now

Please don't ever let me down again
It shouldn't be allowed
Please don't ever make me frown again
You have shown me how

Please don't try to be my friend again
'Cause I don't want you
I don't want you now
I don't want you now

I don't want you now
No, I don't want you now
No, I don't want you now
No, I don't want you now

The truth is that I could have pulled you up

You can try to tie me down
You can try to string me up
But you have no luck now

Please don't ever let me down again
It shouldn't be allowed
Please don't ever make me frown again
You have shown me how

Please don't try to be my friend again
'Cause I don't want you
I don't want you now
I don't want you now
I don't want you now
