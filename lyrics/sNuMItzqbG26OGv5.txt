These days are getting longer
This song is gonna be so loud
You know one thing you told me?
You have a new name now

(This tim I'll stay for good)

We'll do that flash gold
It burned my shadow gray
Where have those far days got to now?

I saw him in the part-shade
He put his hands down low
What else did I see?
What else did they show?
You think it's so unlike me
Why did the city change me?
Red sky, my eyes closed
The fire came so slow

(This time I'll stay for good)
