Sugarboy, I'm in need
How I wish for somethin' sweet
Sugarboy, I am weak
Got a crush on tragedy

Oh, here I go
A casualty hanging on from the balcony
Oh, here I go
Makin' a scene
Oh, here I am
Your pain machine

I am a lot like you
I am alone like you
I am a lot like you
I am alone like you

I am a lot like you
I am alone like you
I am a lot like you
I am alone like you

Sugargirl, figurine
Pledge all your allegiance to me
Sugargirl, dissolve in me
Got a crush from kicked-in teeth

Oh, here I go
A casualty hanging on from the balcony
Oh, here I go
Makin' a scene
Oh, here I am
Your pain machine

I am a lot like you
I am alone like you
I am a lot like you
I am alone like you

I am a lot like you
I am alone like you
I am a lot like you
I am alone like you
