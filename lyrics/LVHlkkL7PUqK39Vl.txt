I cannot rely
(Rely!)
Death if I defy

I cannot rely
(Rely!)
Death if I defy

Procrastination abused
Retaliation ensued
(I cannot rely)
On fallen knees [?] confused
How are we [?]
(What!)
If I [?]

I cannot rely
Death if I defy

I would've pulled you down
With me from your sanctuary
Somewhere, somehow
You could've fooled me now
If you had the voice of a visionary
Somewhere, somehow
I would've let you down
All that remains [?] necessary

I cannot rely
(Rely!)
Death if I defy
(Defy!)

Instead of wasting
My efforts end up unused
(Death if I defy)
[?] and uncontrolled
Now I've got nothing to show
[?] and uncontrolled
Now I've got nothing to show

I would've pulled you down
With me from your sanctuary
Somewhere, somehow
You could've fooled me now
If you had the voice of a visionary
Somewhere, somehow

I would've pulled you down
With me from your sanctuary
Somewhere, somehow
I would've let you down
All that remains [?] necessary

Somewhere, somehow
Somewhere, somehow

So at least we'll drown in hate
(Disarray)
This is emptiness displaced
(Displaced)
[?] clear away
(Grow in disarray)

I would've pulled you down
With me from your sanctuary
Somewhere, somehow
You could've fooled me now
If you hadthe voice of a visionary
Somewhere, somehow

I would've pulled you down
With me from your sanctuary
Somewhere, somehow
I would've let you down
All that remains [?] necessary

Somewhere, somehow
