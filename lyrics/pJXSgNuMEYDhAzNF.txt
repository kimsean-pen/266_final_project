High love in asylum
Where you and I go
Our love in asylum
There we go, go, go crazy.
In a state of madness
Rapped up in your magic, ecstatic and addict,
Oh youre landing on another planet
And it feels like home here
Will never go back then
cause were crazy, Ill go crazy with you
Youre so crazy, Ill go crazy with you
High love in asylum
Where you and I go
Our love in asylum
Where we go, go, go. crazy.
Till the end we go crazy, go
Lose your mind where you need love in asylum
Where you and I go
Our love in asylum
Where you go, go go crazy
Cant nobody save me
Go down with you baby
Ill take you, youll take me
Too crazy, I go crazy with you
Yes go crazy, Ill go crazy with you
High love in asylum
Where you and I go
Our love is in asylum
There we go, go, go. crazy.
