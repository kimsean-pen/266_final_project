Got a little allowance from doing chores
Saving up for a Santa Cruz skateboard
Kid sister said "How much have you saved?"
I calculated then hung my head in shame

I spent it all at Circle K
Dreaming it was only pocket change

Half a mile astride my yellow bike
All the candy and soda pop I'd like
Windows covering one wall of the store
Shelves bathed in the golden-hour glow

I spent it all at Circle K
Dreaming that the light would never change
I spent it all at Circle K
And the good Lord smiled and looked the other way
