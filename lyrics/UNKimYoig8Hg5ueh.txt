had to kiss you one more time
so i followed you home
and i almost lost you at the light.
i've seen you a couple of times
but i had no idea
that you would be mine tonight.

i was to meet another girl,
but she didn't show
and you asked if i was alone, oh
the night came to an end
had to kiss you one more time
so i followed you home, oh

i'm just a boy
i'm on the side
yeah, believe me i don't mind
i'm just a boy
not quite your type
and that don't matter much tonight

yeah, you asked if you could call
but you didn't write it down
so i thought that we were through.
and when you said "hello"
i could not believe
that i got a call from you

it's like candy in a bag
you can put it on a shelf
it's there when you need a taste of, oh
sweetness makes you weak
don't eat it every day
just don't let it go to waste, yeah

i'm just a boy
i'm on the side
yeah, believe me i don't mind
i'm just a boy
not quite your type
and that don't matter much tonight

i'm not sure where i stand
call me when you're lonely
and i'll take you out again, yeah.
i hear you got another guy
i guess he makes you happy
call me a special friend.

i'm just a boy
i'm on the side
yeah, believe me i don't mind
i'm just a boy
not quite your type

i'm just a boy
not quite your type
and that don't matter much tonight
tonight
tonight
that's right.
