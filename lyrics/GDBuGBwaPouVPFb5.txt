I was walking outside in the moonlight
At the church on the ground that nobody know
When I hear it in your voice for the first time
I was staring at the light through the window
I was waking up early, feeling undone
I was crying outside on the front lawn
But you call me with no hesitation
And you love me with no reservation

You touch me like an angel
But you kiss me like a sinner
Got me dying for a miracle
Baby step into the holy water

Tied to your finger like an anchor
Every second go a little deeper
Hold my breath, keep getting out
Hold my breath, don't let it stop
I was up all night feeling messed up
Got a couple bad days I'm ashamed of
But you call me when you're thinking too much
Hold me back, I get up

You touch me like an angel
But you kiss me like a sinner
Got me dying for a miracle
Baby step into the holy water
You touch me like an angel
But you kiss me like a sinner
Got me dying for a miracle
Baby step into the holy water

If there's something I do, change it
I just wanna be the one remaining
And I'll take my chance cause I know you got a wild heart
But I've loved you from the start
I'll love you like you want it to end
I'll love so deep they won't understand
How could I stop when I know what it feels like
Yeah, I find myself so alive with your holy light

You touch me like an angel
But you kiss me like a sinner
Got me dying for a miracle
Baby step into the holy water
(Step into the holy water)
You touch me like an angel
(Touch me like an angel)
But you kiss me like a sinner
(Kiss me like a sinner)
Got me dying for a miracle
Baby step into the holy water
(Step into the holy water)
