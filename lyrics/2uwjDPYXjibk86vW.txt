When she walks
She swings her arms instead of her hips
When she talks
She moves her mouth instead of her lips

And I've waited for her for so long
I've waited for her for so long
I've wondered if I could hang on
I've wondered if I could hang on, yeah

"Let me go", she said
"Let me go", she said
Let me go
And I will want you more

Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
And I will want you

When she wants
She wants the sun instead of the moon
When she sees
She sees the stars inside of her room

And I've waited for her for so long
I've waited for her for so long
I've wondered if I could hang on
I've wondered if I could hang on

"Let me go", she said
"Let me go", she said
Let me go
And I will want you more

"Let me go", she said
Let me go
Let me go
And I will want you

"Let me go", she said
"Let me go", she said
"Let me go", she said
Let me go

"Let me go", she said
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go

Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Let, let me go

Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go

Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Let me
