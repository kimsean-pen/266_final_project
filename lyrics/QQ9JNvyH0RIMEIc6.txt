I feel like playing the game tonight
This town gets lonely after midnight
And when animal hunger runs deep
And now I'm never gonna get to sleep

Well some people claim, but I know, I know
The deepest, darkest place to go
You never get out once they let you in
You never get out once they let you in
You'll be nuttin but a club thing

What would you say to be paid to be one of the beautiful?
Such a beautiful face
Such a beautiful girl

And one thing's for sure, one thing's for certain
That if you get behind the velvet curtain
You'll see, there nothing's as sweet as it looks on my TV

You need a cold soul of concrete here
You got a view without pity
You need a cold soul of concrete here
Just like the soul, the soul of the city

(refrain X 2)
What would you say to be paid to be one of the beautiful?
Such a beautiful face
Such a beautiful girl

Beautiful girl

He watches from the corner
He waits for her to stumble
He knows that he's the king
The king of the cardboard jungle
He knows he cannot fight
What appears to enslave her
He's got a hunger
For the sweetest of flavor

Well, don't worry baby now
It won't be long
Once the hunger start to take you in
Before you know it, you will be gone, gone, gone
To be just another club thing

(refrain X 4)
What would you say to be paid to be one of the beautiful?
Such a beautiful face
Such a beautiful girl
