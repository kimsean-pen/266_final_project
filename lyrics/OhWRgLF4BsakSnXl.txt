I stumbled on this photograph
It kind of made me laugh
It took me way back
Back down memory lane
I see the happiness, i see the pain
Where am i?
Back down memory lane
I see us standing there
Such a happy, happy pair
Love beyond compare
Look a there, look a there
The way you held me
No one could tell me that love would die
Oh why did i have to find this photograph
I thought i had forgot the past
Now i'm slippin' fast
Oh back down memory lane
I feel the happiness, i feel the pain
Here am i back down memory lane
I'm in the sunshine
I'm in the rain
I thought it was over
Here i go again
The way you held me
No one could tell me that love would die

I don't wanna go
Travel up and down
Faster that the speed of sound
Back down memory lane
You steal my foolish heart
Don't let this feeling start
Back down memory lane
I don't wanna go
Back down memory lane

Save me
Save me

Back down memory lane

Save me
Save me
Save me, save me, save me

Back down memory lane
