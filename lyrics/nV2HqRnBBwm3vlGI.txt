She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don't matter cause it's gone
While the sun is bright
Or in the darkest night
No-one knows
She comes and then she goes

Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who is gonna hang a name on you
And when you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Don't ask her why she lives to be so free
She's gonna tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained
To a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost
But such a cost

Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who is gonna hang a name on you
And when you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Oh there's no time to lose I heard her say
You gotta catch your dreams before they run away
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams and you might lose your mind
Is life unkind

Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who is gonna hang a name on you
And when you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who is gonna hang a name on you
And when you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
