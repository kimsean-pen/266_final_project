Whenever I'm with him
Somethin' inside
Start's to burnin'
And I'm filled with desire
Could it be a devil in me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?

It's like a heatwave
Burnin' like a heatwave
Deep in my heart
I can't keep from cryin'
It's tearin' me apart

Whenever he calls my name
Sounds good, it's insane
I can't explain it, don't understand it
I ain't never felt like this before
Now that funny feelin' has me amazed
Don't know what to do, my head's in a haze

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Heatwave!
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Heatwave!
