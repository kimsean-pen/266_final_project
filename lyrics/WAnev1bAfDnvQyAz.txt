Farewell, more than a feeling,
Time's out, try to get through.

My heart is always colored,
My heart is sure to follow.

I'd like to see, I'd like to see
You prove to me,
You prove to me.

Sometimes the things you say,
Sometimes, still out of place.

This time it's said to you
This time you have to chose.

I'd like to see, I'd like to see
You prove to me,
You prove to me,
You prove to me,
You prove to me.
