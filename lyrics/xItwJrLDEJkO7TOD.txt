Now we started from
A background thing find diffusing
If I'm not on
I'll make this home

Back loose this faceless trip you'll induce that face all around
In every strung hold up commune

Anyone
Anyone

I'll be gone 'til I'm gone
Whatever it takes
To break this longing
Let these agents come and trace me
I'll be gone
Til I'm gone

Am I to blame
The room of wrong and illusions
Keeps me sane
Nothing but song

I'll be gone
Til I'm gone
Whatever it takes
To break this longing
Let these agents come and trace me
Said I'll be gone
Til I'm gone

I'll be gone
'til I'm gone
Whatever it takes
To break this longing
Let these agents come and trace me
Said I'll be gone
Til I'm gone

With all it's question assuming
The songs make what were all about
An agent form wont get you me
Everyone
Everyone

I'll be gone
Til I'm gone
Whatever it takes to break this longing
Let these agents come and trace me
Said I'll be gone
Til I'm gone

I'll be gone
Til I'm gone
Whatever it takes
To break this longing
Let these agents come and trace me
I'll be gone
Til I'm gone
I'll be gone
Til I'm gone
Whatever it takes
To break this longing
Let these agents come and trace me
I'll be gone
Til I'm gone
I'll be gone
Til I'm gone
Whatever it takes
To break this longing
Let these agents come and trace me
Said I'll be gone
Til I'm gone
I'll be gone
I'll be gone
