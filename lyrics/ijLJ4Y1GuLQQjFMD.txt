I love how you play with illusion
cause you know how badly we need them
to live our silly lives
But honey you're so real
and you dance around fear
and you tell me you love the way that I make you feel

And I'll call you Orlando
We don't have to play roles
unless it's just for fun
Cause darlin' you are
just who you are
and you don't make me feel like I'm the woman I am not

Do you mind if I call you Orlando?
We haven't even met yet but I know
that you're the one I want
And you can find me here
I'll be singing in your ear
and we will see each other as a mirror through the years

And I'll call you Orlando
We don't have to play roles
unless it's just for fun
Cause darlin' you are
just who you are
and you don't make me feel like I'm the woman I am not
Oh, hi Orlando
