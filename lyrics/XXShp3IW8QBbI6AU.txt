Could I be falling for you?
Is this a fantasy come true?
Is this a dream that I've waited for?
Am I the one that you adore?

I think I'm falling for you
What am I supposed to do?
'Cause you make me feel like I'm falling in love
Am I falling for you?

Could it be love, tell me boy, is it true?
I get a rush when I think about you

Lose control from my body and my soul
And when you hold me, I don't want to let go
Give me reason every reason
Just to love you babe

Everything that you do is so amazing
I can't believe what your body
Makes me wanna do
I'm having visions of me all over you

I think I'm falling for you
What am I supposed to do?
'Cause you make me feel like I'm falling in love
Am I falling for you?

But you must have known though I try to disguise
The way I feel was there fire in my eyes?
On that night when our bodies intertwined
I knew right there and then that you will be mine

Could I be falling for you?
Is this a fantasy come true?
Is this a dream that I've waited for?
Am I the one that you adore?
Adore, tell me

I think I'm falling for you
What am I supposed to do?
'Cause you make me feel like I'm falling in love
Am I falling for you?

I think I'm falling for you
What am I supposed to do?
'Cause you make me feel like I'm falling in love
Am I falling for you?

Everyday you seem to find
A way to make me go crazy
I just can't understand
But let me tell you one thing
You make me wanna sing

I think I'm falling for you
What am I supposed to do?
'Cause you make me feel like I'm falling in love
Am I falling for you?

I think I'm falling for you
What am I supposed to do?
