Would I tell you
If I couldn't see no way
Dare I bore you
I'd come for you
And rally you, I'd say
Lets go forward

Fuel my fire
The numbness (will) falls away
We find our way through
I'm'a do my thing
I'm 'a run a ring round their nothing
Walkin that line
It feel like an earthquake
Got me hemmed in but I'm hard to break

Goldfire
Ahhhh
Can't taunt me with your water
Ahhhh
Gold fire
Ahhhh
Incitin' the disorder
Ahhhh
Burning' through your borders
Oh you make me see
Ain't nothing what seems to be
I'm not frettin anything you say
Doesn't mean a thing to me

I'll keep telling you until you get (it)
Always sincere are you not ready yet
Locked down in the cell of your head
Got me outta bounds I care too much
I'mma do
I'mma do my thing
I'm 'a run a ring round your nothing
Walkin that line
It feel like an earthquake
Got me hemmed in but I'm hard to break

Goldfire
Ahhhh
Can't taunt me with your water
Ahhhh
Gold fire
Ahhhh
Incitin' the disorder
Ahhhh
Burning' through your borders
Oh you make me see
Ain't nothing what seems to be
I'm not frettin anything you say
Doesn't mean a thing to me

And my flame stayed 'til you clear out my way (Wah ooh)
And my flame stayed 'til you clear out my way (Wah ooh)
And my flame stayed 'til you clear out my way (Wah ooh)
And my flame stayed 'til you clear out my way (Wah ooh)
And my flame stayed 'til you clear out my way (Wah ooh)
