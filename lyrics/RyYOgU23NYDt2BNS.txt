Bury your head
Bury your head

I was feeling fine
You'll be coming clean tonight
And I'll be falling down with you once again
Call me your valentine, call me once tonight
And I will have said it's okay

The things you said, I'm rehearsing them
The things you said, I'm rehearsing them

They went back on us
(Closed eyes rolled back couldn't step it up)
I could know him to come over when
It's the thought that emerges
(Take back couldn't step it up)
I could never love, your eyes have changed

Bury your head
Has the child smashed you down
And the psalms will never call me again
(Fall down below)
I'll sleep tonight when you're okay
And I haven't said it's okay

The things you said, I'm rehearsing them
The things you said, I'm rehearsing them

They went back on us
(Closed eyes rolled back couldn't step it up)
I could know him to come over when
It's the thought that emerges
(Take back couldn't step it up)
I could never love, your eyes have changed

They will been the ones who'll see who comes
This is what you call love

They stole my lies
Sold right and all
They wandered around and round my mouth,
They stole my lies
Sold right and all
(Stole it all)
They have been the ones who've seen enough

They went back on us
(Closed eyes rolled back couldn't step it up)
I could know him to come over when
It's the thought that emerges
(Take back couldn't step it up)
I could never love, your eyes have changed

You'll be coming clean tonight...
