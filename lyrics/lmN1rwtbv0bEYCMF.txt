Carry it off to an old sky
If it never comes you will know why
A couple seconds alone goes to lost years
Kicked in the back, it's a good feel
The gray has lost its hope today
Okay
Blatantly fake, but you still chase
Cloudy ideas that are not fate
A couple hours alone, that's a decade
I love you to death, it's a mistake
The gray has lost its hope today
Okay
Again
Carry it off to an old sky
It never comes, you'll know why
A couple seconds alone turns to lost years
Kicked in the back, it's a good feel
The gray has lost its hope today
Okay
Again
