Open your eyes cause another day is dawning
Children of the night can you hear them all calling
Skies open up and the angels start falling
Listen to the beasts, do you hear them hollering

Start in the morning through till the evening
Dance like you are the only one around
Move like you want it, groove like you need it
Dance lose it all till the sun goes down

Free your mind cause tonight we are gonna break it down
Shake it, make it, funky down
Get so high as the toxins in your body
Are the base and drums and the ra ra ra

We are right on time
And all is fine
If you've lost your senses
Here have mine

Lose yourself
From the time you awake
Till the evening time
Until the sunshine breaks

Open your eyes cause another day is dawning
Children of the night can you hear them all calling
Skies open up and the angels start falling
Listen to the beasts, do you hear them hollering

Start in the morning through till the evening
Dance like you are the only one around
Move like you want it, groove like you need it
Dance lose it all till the sun goes down

Till the sun goes down

Welcome all to the amazing hysteria
You feeling what we bring to ya
Peace and love find yourself getting low tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight)

Father's praying on our soles
Children in the forest play
Angels come protect our souls
Because the beast is hunting for it's prey

Until the sun goes down
Until the sun goes down
Sun goes down
Sun goes down
Sun goes down
Sun goes down

Open your eyes cause another day is dawning
Children of the night can you hear them all calling
Skies open up and the angels start falling
Listen to the beasts, do you hear them hollering

Start in the morning through till the evening
Dance like you are the only one around
Move like you want it, groove like you need it
Dance lose it all till the sun goes down

Goes down
Sun goes down

Start in the morning through till the evening
Dance like you are the only one around
Move like you want it, groove like you need it
Dance lose it all till the sun goes down

Until the sun goes down
Until the sun goes down
Until the sun goes down
