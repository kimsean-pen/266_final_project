When the homeless clouds starts vanishing
And the river freezes over
I can watch the sunlight melt the snow
I can feel a new light start to grow

But I still got miles to go before I sleep
Still got miles to go before all is revealed
Still got miles to go before I sleep
Still listening to the chainless wind sing

I could build a nest in the frost and fire
While the sun is flaming on the ice
And stat unravelling this broken soul
It's time this time, and I can feel a new light

But I still got miles to go before I sleep
Still got miles to go before all is revealed
Still got miles to go before I sleep
Still listening to the chainless wind sing

I still got miles to go before I sleep
Still got miles to go before all is revealed
Still got miles to go before I sleep
Still listening to the chainless wind sing
