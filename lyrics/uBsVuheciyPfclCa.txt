i thought i'd found a reason to live
just like before when i was a child
only to find dreams made of sand
would just fall apart and slip through my hands

but the spirit of life keeps us strong
and the spirit of life is the will to carry on

adversity what have i done to you
to cause this reclusive silence
that has come between me and you

and the spirit of life remains in light
and the spirit of life remains inside

i never thought it would be quite like this
living outside of mutual bliss
but as long as the veins in our arm still stand up
the spirit of life will keep living on
