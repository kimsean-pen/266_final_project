You've done it all,
You've broken every code,
And pulled the rebel to the floor.
You spoilt the game, no matter what you say.
For only metal -- what a bore!

Blue eyes, blue eyes,
How come you tell so many lies?

Come up and see me, make me smile,
Or do what you want, running wild.

There's nothing left,
All gone and run away.
Maybe you'll tarry for awhile.
It's just a test, a game for us to play.
Win or lose, it's hard to smile.

Resist, resist,
It's from yourself you have to hide.

Come up and see me to make me smile,
Oh, or do what you want, running wild.

There ain't no more.
You've taken everything,
From my belief in Mother Earth.
Can you ignore my faith in everything,
'Cause I know what faith is and what it's worth?

Away, away,
And don't say maybe you'll try,

Oh, to come up and see me to make me smile,
Or do what you want, just running wild.

Ooh, la la la
Ooh, la la la
Oooooh

Come up and see me, make me smile,
Or do what you want, running wild.

Ooh, la la la
Ooh, la la la
Oooooh

Come up and see me to make me smile...
