I'm hurting you again
Too lonely to pretend
Like everything is new
I promise you to
Blow it all away

In your world
No one is crying alone
In your world
No one is dying alone

Too broken to belong
Too weak to sing along
I'll comfort you my friend
Helping you to
Blow it all away

In your world
No one is crying alone
In your world
No one is dying alone
