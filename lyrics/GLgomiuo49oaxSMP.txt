There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that she turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although I may not be the man some girls think of as handsome
To my heart she carries the key
Won't you tell her please to put on some speed, follow my lead
Oh, how I need someone to watch over me

There's a saying old says that love is blind,
Still were often told, "seek and ye shall find"
So I'm going to seek a certain one I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found her yet
She's the big affair I cannot forget
Only one I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add my initial to her monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

Won't you tell her please to put on some speed, follow my lead
Oh, how I need someone to watch over me
Someone to watch over me
