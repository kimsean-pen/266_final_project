The mighty sound of damnation calls
As holocaust sky draw near

Above the storms over Baeskades
Rule the power of the Vrilla

It's come to ride the seven winters
With winds of war and winds of cold

Lightning strikes the Northland
Leading us into seasons of frost

Stand in fog with so cold a heart
Watching the death of the sun

Valleys abound a thousand of coffins
The holocaust has just begun

It's the march of the blasphemous masses
Into damnation all will fall

Chapels of black unholy demons
Chanting the words of the funeral rites

Pure holocaust

Chanting words of funeral rites
Chapels of black unholy demons

Into damnation all will fall
It's the march of blasphemous masses

The holocaust's just begun
Valleys abound a thousands of coffins

Watching the death of the sun
ohh Stand in the fog with so cold a heart

Leading us into seasons of frost
Lightning strikes the Northland

Wind of war and winds of cold
It's come to ride the seven winters

Rule the power of the Vrilla
Above storms on Baeskades

As the holocaust sky draw near
The mighty sound of damnation call

Pure holocaust
