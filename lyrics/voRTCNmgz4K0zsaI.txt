Left out
An ocean on top
Blue tie
And orange won't let go
Let me be
Please won't please

Blush now
They can't know
Lifelong
History shows
That
Brown won't go
Brown just glows

And we'll light
Ourselves on fire
Just to see
Who really
Wants to believe
That it's just me

Tender
Humor in hair
Half me
With something to spare
Rhythm folds
Now go untold

Gently
My mistake
Old burn
Let it take you days
And for days now
I'll wait around

And we'll light
Our lives on fire
Just to see
If anyone will come
Rescue
What's left of me
