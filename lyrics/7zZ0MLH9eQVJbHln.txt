Taking side streets with the fast hearts that we're holding
After sunset through my Harlet to the ocean
I don't know when
I'll see you again
I don't know when
But this ain't the end
I know you love the lights
Know you love the lights
I-I know you love the nights
Know you love the nights
I-I know you love the lights
Know you love them that's why I'm taking you there
Leaving landmarks we can go to when we're older
I'll be right there when you're not here to be closer
I don't know when
I'll see you again
I don't know when
But this ain't the end
I know you love the lights
Know you love the lights
I-I know you love the nights
Know you love the nights
I-I know you love the lights
Know you love them that's why I'm taking you there
I know you love the lights
Know you love the lights
I-I know you love the nights
Know you love the nights
I-I know you love the lights
Know you love them that's why I'm taking you there
I know you love the lights
Know you love the lights
I-I know you love the nights
Know you love the nights
I-I know you love the lights
Know you love them that's why I'm taking you there
I know you love the lights
Know you love the lights
I-I know you love the nights
Know you love the nights
I-I know you love the lights
Know you love them that's why I'm taking you there
