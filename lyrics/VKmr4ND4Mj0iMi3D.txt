So the Count of Monte Christo
Threw the cape over his head
Gave me a penny for my thoughts
But wouldn't get no change, just
Old aged rhythmns
They were singing in his brain for
A mechanical crusade
tried to shoot down his areoplane

I see, you see
Ain't no more honey from this bee
I see, you see
Stung you've got a hold on me
I see, you see
Ain't no more honey from this bee
I see, you see
Stung you've got a hold

I want to make you feel so special
It's time to break the ice
Bless you and your wicked ways
For I guess that these are stranger days
But the tact must change for
The duchess to reveal her face
I'd give you all my pennies
For your gallantry at tomorrow's gate

When I see, you see
Ain't no more honey from this bee
I see, you see
I'm stung you've got a hold on me
I see, you see
Ain't no more honey from this bee
I see, you see
I'm stung you've got a hold

So the Count of Monte Christo
Threw the cape over his head
Gave me a penny for my thoughts
But wouldn't get no change, just
Old aged rhythmns
They were singing in his brain for
A mechanical crusade
tried to shoot down his areoplane

I see, you see...
