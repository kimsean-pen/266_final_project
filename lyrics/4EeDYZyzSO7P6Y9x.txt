In my mind, I've acquired a tangle
I can't undo
I've been thinking about nothing else...
Lately
Does it feel as if somebody's keeping an eye on you?
Peripheral vision
Playing tricks on you
Awoooh...
'been meaning to say
I just wanna be where you are
Before you escape
Awoooh...
Hush now
Don't explain
Wound up with a heavy heart
From waiting in the rain
Pardon me, baby
But who's the mystery girl?
Don't you try to calm me down
Don't you try to calm me down
Was it just you and her
Did you go in the photo booth?
Was it loud?
Was it hot?
Was it lively enough
For you?
Is she likely to be there
If I were to show up soon?
The little suspicions
Clinging onto me

Awoooh...
'been meaning to say
I just wanna be where you are
Before you escape

Awoooh...
Hush now
Don't explain
Wound up with a heavy heart
From waiting in the rain
Pardon me, baby
But who's the mystery girl?

Don't you try to calm me down
Don't you try to calm me down

Pardon me, baby
But who's the mystery girl?
Mystery girl...

Awooooh...
Ooohhh...

I know that we're growing apart
Because you planted the seeds yourself
(Awooooh...)
I know that we're growing apart
Because you planted the seeds yourself
Don't you try to calm me down!
Don't you try to calm me down!
Don't you try to calm me down!
Don't you try to calm me down!
