Those schoolgirl days
Of telling tales and
Biting nails are gone
But in my mind, I know

They will still live on and on
But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume

It isn't easy but I'll try
If you wanted the sky
I would write across
The sky in letters

That would soar
A thousand feet high
To Sir with love
The time has come

For closing books and
Long last looks must end
And as I leave, I know that

I am leaving my best friend
A friend who taught
Me right from wrong
And weak from strong
That's a lot to learn
What, what can I give you in return
If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you
Let me give my heart
To Sir with love
