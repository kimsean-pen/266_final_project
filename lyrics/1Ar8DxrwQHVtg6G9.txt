My girl looks like David Bowie
Not sure if it's a boy or a girl
She swears that life on Mars
Is better than to live on the ground
But everybody lives on the ground
Except the birds and the astronauts

My girl looks like David Bowie
It's all day christmas, champagne on ice
She's got a station to station sign
Written on both of her arms
Which way to go it's hard to decide
But I wouldn't ring no alarms

You think they took it all from you
Remember what your mother said when you were five years old
Now that you got it all for you
Remember what your mother said

Louise
Won't you take it easy
Life it ain't
No rock'n roll song

My girl looks like David Bowie
Thank you love the pleasure is blind
From the unknown workin' man
To the princess on the steeple that shines
Looking at the brighter side
Things cannot be that bad

My girl looks like david Bowie
One can tell with a glimpse of an eye
She used to wear high heel shoes
Only to reach for the stars
But the factory broke down
And she only met guys in bars

You think they took it all from you
Remember what your mother said when you were five years old
Now that you got it all for you
Remember what your mother said

Louise
Won't you take it easy
Life it ain't
No rock'n roll song
