I don't know
What happened to the boy,
Poor slave-toy
To the old sardine-can.

Either way, he's dead for all I care.
They are all dead... for all I care.

As an iron rule of thumb:
Voice and vision must be ONE.
Grateful to the hands you bring,
But quietly the angels sing.

Politeness was the hand that wrote
His name on parchment, graciously.
Only a servant by my side...
The only help he could provide.

'Cause as an iron rule of thumb:
Voice and vision MUST be one.
Grateful to the hands you bring,
But quietly the servants sing.

Grateful to the hands you bring,
But quietly the peasants sing.

GONE

So far, so good... so what?!
After 55 years odd,
Minor things have changed... a lot;
Too sad, if they had not.

One line, it stands out to this day,
When the sadness comes to stay.
Loneliness, it made me forget,
And what is gone, it won't come back.

So far, so good... so what?!
After 55 years odd,
Minor things, they may have changed the plot.
It would be sad, if they had not.
