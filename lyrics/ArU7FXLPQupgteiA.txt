We're televisions whose mouths and words
Don't line up like they should
You're hard concrete, while I'm stuck on
The blood staining it and where it came from

Coffee cups collect at the side of my bed
Red pins pushed through the places I've been
I tie them together with a string
The pattern just tells me, "Go to sleep"
I should go to sleep

I'm getting used to my skin but it doesn't fit right
I share my name with a stranger all my life
And I feel it all, Carolina in my blood
Run, brother, run

I was twenty-five when my dad died
My arm's fell weak, my heart grew tired
And every girl I tried to kiss
Gives that look you did so I choose to miss

Find the greatest books read to the end
In those last lines you'll find my friends
Like flies on tape, I keep them close
We may look dead but move our toes

I'm getting used to my skin but it doesn't fit right
I share my name with a stranger all my life
And I feel it all, Carolina in my blood
Run, brother, run

I keep your things in my garage
I won't drive away
I feel it all, Carolina in my blood
Run, brother, run
