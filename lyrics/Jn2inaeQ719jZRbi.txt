Your're over my shoulder, i think i'm possesed
your constant undertone is making me toothless
time's come to trim you gonna get out my knife
gonna cut you baby, out of my life
Daredevil, she-devil, printer's devil, evil
i love you like sin, but i won't be your pigeon
daredevil, she-devil, printer's devil, evil
i love you like sin, but i won't be your pigeon
The power that i give you i'm so sick of your voice
in my body you don't give me no choice
but to boot you, honey, to give you he shove
so take back your despot, i'll keep the love
Daredevil, she-devil, printer's devil, evil
i love you like sin, but i won't be your pigeon
daredevil, she-devil, printer's devil, evil
i love you like sin, but i won't be your pigeon
I'm searching my symbols, looking for a pistol
to laser you out it looks like a key hole
i'll just stick my key back, seamless and whole
no more idols got my own self control
Daredevil, she-devil, printer's devil, evil
i love you like sin, but i won't be your pigeon
daredevil, she-devil, printer's devil, evil
i love you like sin, but i won't be your pigeon
Daredevil, she-devil, printer's devil, evil
i love you like sinful love
Daredevil, she-devil, printer's devil, evil
i love you like sinful love
Daredevil, she-devil, printer's devil, evil
i love you like sinful love
Daredevil, she-devil, printer's devil, evil
i love you like sinful love
Daredevil, she-devil, printer's devil, evil
i love you, i love you like sinful love
Daredevil, she-devil, printer's devil, evil
i love you like sinful love
Daredevil, she-devil, printer's devil, evil
