I am a honey bee,
Shunned off from the colony
and they won't let me in

So I left the hive,
They took away all my stripes*
and broke off both my wings

So I'll find another tree
and make the wind my friend
I'll just sing with the birds
They'll tell me secrets of the world

But my other honey bee
Stuck where he doesn't wanna be
But my darling, honey bee
I'll come save you
Even if it means I'd have to face the queen

~ Da param pam param pam
Para ra ra pa pa ra ram ~

So I'll come prepared,
My new friends said they would help me
get my loved one back

They say it isn't right,
The bees have control of your mind,*
but I choose not to believe that

So we'll meet in the darkness of the night,
and I promised I will be there on time
We'll be guided by my new friends, the butterflies,
bring us back to our own little hive

Oh my other honey bee,
No longer stuck where he doesn't wanna be
Oh my darling, honey bee,
I have saved you
And now that you're with me,
we can make our own honey

~ Oh param pam param pam
Para ra ra pa pa ra ram ~
