Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely

And you're never coming round
(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit tired

Of listening to the sound of my tears
(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous

The best of all the years have gone by
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified and

Then I see the look in your eyes
(Turn around) bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart
(Turn around) bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight

Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Once upon a time I was falling in love

now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time there was light in my life

now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
total eclipse of the heart
Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart

Turn around bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart
And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight

We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Once upon a time I was falling in love
now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
total eclipse of the heart
total eclipse of the heart
A total eclipse of the heart
Turn around, bright eyes
