Show a little more
Show a little less
Add a little smoke
Welcome to Burlesque

Everything you dream of
But never can possess
Nothing's what it seems
Welcome to Burlesque

Oh!
Everyone is buying
Put your money in my hand
If you got a little extra
Well, give it to the band

You may not be guilty
But your ready to confess
Tell me what you need
Welcome to Burlesque

You can dream of Coco
But do it at your risk
The triplets grant you mercy
But not your every wish
Jessie keeps you guessing
So cool and statuesque
Behave yourself says Georgia
Welcome to Burlesque

Oh!
Everyone is buying
Put your money in my hand
If you want a little extra
Well, you know where I am

Something there in the dark
Is playing with your mind
It's not the end of days
But just the bump and grind
Show a little more!
Show a little less!
Add a little smoke
Welcome to Burlesque!.
