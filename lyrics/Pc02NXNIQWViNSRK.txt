Seen my share of
Broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone
Wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine

Angels come down
From the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us
Then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save

Seen my share of
Broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone
Wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

Don't go looking
For the reasons
Don't go asking
Jesus why?
We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by

Seen my share of
Broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone
Wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
