Arms by my side, heart on my sleeve,
The chandelier falls as I stand underneath,
Won't you give it up this time?
Won't you give it up to save?
Watch this come alive,
That was yesterday...

Tick tock,
Ready,
Holding,
To put hope back on the shelf

This is the last time
I stay up all night,
Forget everything and I'm starting with you
I love you but I,
I must say goodbye
Forget everything and I'm staring with you

Where do you run?
What can you lose?
Run from yourself but you're still stuck with you

Won't you give it up this time?
Won't you give it up to save?
Watch this come alive,
That was yesterday...

Clock's got his hands in the air as I'm fallin'
The clock's got his hands in the air as I'm calling out
Clock's got his hands by his sides I'm still waiting,
I'm still waiting,
I'm still waiting

Tick tock,
Ready,
Holding,
To put hope back on the shelf

This is the last time
I stay up all night,
Forget everything and I'm starting with you
I love you but I,
I must say goodbye
Forget everything and I'm staring with you

With you, with you, with you,
I'm starting with you

Forget everything and I'm starting with you

This is the last time
I stay up all night,
Forget everything and I'm starting with you
I love you but I,
I must say goodbye
Forget everything and I'm staring with you

With you, with you, with you,
I'm starting with you

Tick tock,
Ready,
Holding,
To put hope back on the shelf
