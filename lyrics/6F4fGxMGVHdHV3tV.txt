I lose my way, I lose my mind
I lose my, myself a million times
Oh, myself a million times, where am I?
And I thought my thoughts, I think a lot
Oh gosh, oh gosh It's not enough
I had a hole in the middle, a storm in my head, where am I?
I really don't know where to go
know, I really don't know where to go, oh
I keep staring through the window
I don't get you people
I keep staring through the window
I don't get you people
And I, don't know what I could have,
I don't know what I could have done
And I've seen you through the glasses passing by, like all my chances
Goodbye to all my chances
Goodbye to all my chances, yeah
I doubt my way, I doubt my mind
I doubt my, myself a thousand times
But on the other hand, I guess it's all up to you
But on the other hand, it's up to you, oh
I keep staring through the window
I don't get you people
I keep staring through the window
I don't get you people
People
People
Ah, looking at the people
I don't know what I have,
I don't know what I could have done
And I've seen you through the glasses passing by, like all my chances
Goodbye to all my chances
Goodbye to all my chances
Goodbye to all my chances
I don't know what I have,
I don't know what I could have done
And I've seen you through the glasses passing by, like all my chances
Goodbye to all my chances
Goodbye to all my chances
Goodbye to all my chances
