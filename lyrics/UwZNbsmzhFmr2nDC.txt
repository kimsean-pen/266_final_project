Lost in thought, recounting the cost
When sanity became askew
When turning the pages of life, concentrated
On killing the sorrow that tears us in two

A faded memory
Of what used to be
The burden and the noose
Just cut me loose
Just cut me loose

It can't be mistaken, the spirit is vacant
When hope for tomorrow is nowhere in view
Living so close to a weakness
That continues to keep you held down
Hear the sound
Of the voice that is screaming
What's lost is now found

A faded memory
Of what used to be (used to be)
The burden and the noose
Just cut me loose

Ghosts of the past
No longer torment me
I release the anguish

A faded memory (memory)
Of what used to be (used to be)
The burden and the noose
Begging you to cut me loose
The burden and the noose
Just cut me loose

Cut me, cut me, cut me loose
