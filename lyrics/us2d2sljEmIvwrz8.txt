All day I've faced a barren waste
Without the taste of water,
Cool water
Old Dan and I with throats burned dry
And souls that cry for water,
Cool, clear water

Keep a-movin', Dan,
Don't you listen to him, Dan
He's a devil not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water

Dan can you see that big green tree
Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waiting there for me and you
It's water
Cool, clear water

The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star's a pool of water,
Cool water

But with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on to water,
Cool, clear water

Keep a-movin', Dan,
Don't you listen to him, Dan
He's a devil not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water

Dan can you see that big green tree
Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waiting there for me and you
It's water
Cool, clear water
Cool, clear water
Cool, clear water
