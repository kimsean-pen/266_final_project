A man decides after seventy years
That what he goes there for
Is to unlock the door
While those around him criticize and sleep
And through a fractal on a breaking wall
I see you my friend,

and touch your face again
Miracles will happen as we trip
But we're never gonna survive, unless...
We get a little crazy

No we're never gonna survive, unless...
We are a little... Crazy
Yellow people walking through my head
One of them's got a gun,
to shoot the other one
And yet together they were friends at school
Ohh, get it, get it, get it, get it no no!
If all were there when we first took the pill
Then maybe, then maybe, then maybe, then maybe

Miracles will happen as we speak.
But we're never gonna survive unless...
We get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive unless...
We are a little... Crazy...
No no, never survive,
unless we get a little... bit...
In a sky full of people,

only some want to fly
Isn't that crazy?
In a world full of people,
only some want to fly

Isn't that crazy?
Crazy...
In a heaven of people there's
only some want to fly,
Ain't that crazy?
Crazy... crazy... crazy
But we're never gonna survive unless,
we get a little crazy
No we're never gonna to survive unless
we are a little... crazy
No no, we never survive,
unless we get a little... bit...
