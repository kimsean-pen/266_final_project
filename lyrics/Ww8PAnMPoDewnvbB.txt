I broke down last week
I couldn't pick myself up
My momma called me last week
I started to cry when I hung up
I had a threesome last night
I woke up all alone
I guess that's total freedom, that's nice
I should have turned off my phone

Baby I'm just too weak
Too weak to speak
Lets talk in a week

Baby I'm just too weak
Too weak to speak
Lets talk in a week

Six speeds, six speeds on my bike
Six speeds, six speeds on my bike
And I'm moving pretty fast
Moving, moving pretty fast from it
And I'm moving pretty fast
Moving, moving pretty fast from it

Pretty people seem so unhappy with themselves
If I had a face like that I'd never love no one else
And I don't want to cry
'Cause nobody ever cries if they're tough
Leave me out to dry, just so I can lie with the rest of the stuff

But nobody likes
That's too hard to bite
It's not worth the fight
Won't do it right
The one that nobody likes
Too hard to bite
Not worth the fight
Won't do it right

Six speeds, six speeds on my bike
Six speeds, six speeds on my bike
And I'm moving pretty fast
Moving, moving pretty fast from it
And I'm moving pretty fast
Moving, moving pretty fast from it
