I don't love how you love
But please dont leave me here alone
I don't feel how you feel
Well it's my fault I'm bones
I don't die how you die
I can't just waste away
You keep changing your life
Everyday

If it burns I'll keep fueling the same dream
If you fall I'll remember to save game
I don't want your remedy

I don't fall how you fall
I wont hold on, you cant let go
Well it's pain that I feared
I made you take it slow
I don't cry how you cry
Theres nothing left in me
You keep changing my life
Everyday

If it burns I'll keep fueling the same dream
If you fall I'll remember to save game
I don't want your remedy
If it burns I'll keep fueling the same dream
If you fall I'll remember to save game
I don't want your remedy

I don't want...
I don't need...
I don't want...

If it burns I'll keep fueling the same dream
If you fall I'll remember to save game
I don't want your remedy
If it burns I'll keep fueling the same dream
If you fall I'll remember to save game
I don't want your remedy

I don't want...
I don't need...
