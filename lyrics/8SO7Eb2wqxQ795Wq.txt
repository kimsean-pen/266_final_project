Perfect timing, something unpredictable
You remind me, of someone that I never know

And nobody wants you like I do
Nobody feels you like I could
Nobody sees you quite the way I do, way I do
And nobody treats you like I would
And we both know that

Life's too short, let's not waste
Any time, we can wait
Cause we might find, that there's no time
Cause life's too short

There's some situations that turn into relationships, damn
Too impatient, I can't sit back and wait for it

Cause nobody wants you like I do
Nobody feels you like I could
Nobody sees you quite the way I do, way I do
And nobody treats you like I would
And we both know that

Life's too short, let's not waste
Any time, we can wait
Cause we might find, that there's no time
Cause life's too short
You know that
Life's too short, let's not waste
Any time, we can wait
Cause we might find, that there's no time
Cause life's too short
