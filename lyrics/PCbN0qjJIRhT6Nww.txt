It all goes back to the first kiss
It was the one I thought I'd never miss
Maybe we were one of the lucky ones
Maybe I'm just not quite strong enough

This was supposed to be the easy part
But breaking down is what I found hard
Now I'm wearing this smile that I don't believe in
Inside I feel like screaming

She gave me every reason to believe I'd found the one
But my doubts somehow they sold me out

I'm bruised and scarred
Save me from this broken heart
All my love will slowly fade and fall apart
Someone please sing this lovesick melody
Call my name if you're afraid
I'm just a kiss away

I'm finding out in the hardest way
The consequence of every mistake I've ever made
Baby what's it like to be alone?
(Baby, what's it like to be alone)
I don't want to know, I don't want to know

She gave me every reason to believe I'd found the one
But my doubts somehow they sold me out

I'm bruised and scarred
Save me from this broken heart
All my love will slowly fade and fall apart
Someone please sing this lovesick melody
Call my name if you're afraid
I'm just a kiss away

So baby be honest
Is this what you wanted?
We lost what we started
And found out much more than we want to know
(More than we want to know)
About how we're letting go
(About how we're letting go)

So baby be honest
Is this what you wanted?
We lost what we started
And found out much more than we want to know
I'm bruised and scarred
Save me from this broken heart
All my love will slowly fade and fall apart
Someone please sing this lovesick melody
Call my name if you're afraid
I'm just a kiss away
