You shoot me down in flames
You put me down a lot
I'm givin' you my heart, go an' take it
Please be careful not to break it
Just remember it's the only one I've got
It's the only one I've got

Don't break my heart
Don't break my heart
(Uhh)
Don't break my heart

You make me laugh a lot and buy me silly things
And I'd rather be with you than anyone else
But if you make me mad
But if you make me mad
You'll wish that you had not
You'll wish that you had not

Don't break my heart
Don't break my heart
Don't break my heart
Don't break my heart

Where are the roses and whispered sighs
Where are the compliments and dreamin' eyes
It doesn't matter you see, I know you love me
Real basic love never dies
Ohh

Don't break my heart
Don't break my heart
Don't break my heart

Where are the roses and whispered sighs
(Don't break my heart)
Where are the compliments and dreaming eyes
(Don't break my heart)
It doesn't matter you see, I know you love me
Real basic love never dies
Don't break my heart
Don't break my heart
Don't break my heart
