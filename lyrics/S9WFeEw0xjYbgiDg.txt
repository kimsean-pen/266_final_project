My favorite song
My favorite song
Reminds me of the first time I went to space
It was such a long journey
It took hours, days, years
But when it was over...

Oh, it takes me back
That takes me back to the first time
I stepped into space
You were there!
You were there with all my best friends!

I remember!
I remember the look on your face!
The way you said, with your eyes.
You said...

And then I slipped out of the Sun's sphere of influence
Nothing was happening
It was so dizzying

And then you took everything from me
I was left here, a shell of my self
I was left here to pick up the pieces
And every piece was...

la
Give me love

That's when you saved me
At the last possible moment
You brought you big hand out
And scooped up my shit
And took me home

That day you gave a new faith
In how people can save one another
Instead of always putting out their hands
To crush

When you're out in space
You feel so good
Nanana nanana nanana nana

When you're out in space
You feel so good
Nanana nanana nanana nana

When you're out in space
You feel so good
Nanana nanana nanana nana

When you're out in space
You feel so good

When you're out in space
You feel so good
Nanana nanana nanana nana

When you're out in space
You feel so good

When you're out in space
You feel so good
Nanana nanana nanana nana

When you're out in space
You feel so good
