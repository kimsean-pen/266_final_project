It seems like yesterday
I heard the people say
Son you were born to stray
Someday you'll settle down
I guess there'll come a time
Maybe I'll tow the line
Right now I'm doing fine
Rolling from town to town

I don't care where I ride
I'll let my feet decide
Do anything but don't ask that I
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes

Guitars and ringing tones
In my blood and in my bones
Show me a bus
And I'll call it home
'Cuz I don't wanna change
On a lonely day
When they put me in my grave
Ain't a worry you need to save
Just hang up my rock and roll shoes

I don't care where I ride
I'll let my feet decide
Do anything but don't ask that I
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes

So let that motor run
Headed out towards the sun
I'm in the mood for moving on
But I'll be back someday

I don't care where I ride
I'll let my feet decide
Do anything but don't ask that I
Hang up my rock and roll shoes

I don't care where I ride
I'll let my feet decide
Do anything but don't ask that I
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoes

Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Hang up my rock and roll shoesYeah
Hang up my rock and roll shoes
I'm gonna Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Let me Hang up my rock and roll shoes

Hang up my rock and roll shoes
Why don't you Hang up my rock and roll shoes
