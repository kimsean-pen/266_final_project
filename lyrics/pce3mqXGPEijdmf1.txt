My darling, darling girl
Won't you shout it to the world?
My darling, darling, darling girl
Shout it out, my golden girl
Wrap yourself with all the world

Little bit of gold, little bit of pearl
Little bit of gold, little bit of pearl
(Oh, my golden girl)
Little bit of gold, little bit of pearl
(Wrap yourself in all the world)

Little bit of gold little bit of pearl
(Shout it, golden girl)
Little bit of gold little bit of pearl
(Wrap yourself around the world)
Little bit of gold, little bit of pearl
Little bit of gold, little bit of pearl

Wrap yourself around the world
(Little bit of gold, little bit of pearl)
