When I opened my eyes, I thought I was with her
But I was out of town, and out of breath
Wondering if I just heard the sound of a whisper
Coming through the drapes of my hotel

Lion, run away
Get out of your cage
Your luck will be over soon
Lion, run away
Just follow her trace
The hunt will be over soon

Never scared by the knife
I can always resist her
I can feel it crawling in my chest
I pulled her down to the ground
I was feeling a shiver
Now I never, never, never wanna leave again

Lion, run away
Get out of your cage
Your luck will be over soon
Lion, run away
Just follow her trace
The hunt will be over soon
