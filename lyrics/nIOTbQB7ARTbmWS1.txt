Worm infested rotten flesh - The stench is what I lust
Vomit on a corpse face - Maggots eat the crust
Fornicating zombies in a grave that reeks with death
Rotten fetus in the garbage - Hanger through it's head
Rabid dogs feed on a corpse, the bones are stripped of flesh
Twisted and disfigured children - Struck by violent death
Sickened in the mind by all the death that you have known
Forever you will smell the stench of rotting flesh and bone

Torturing your brain, driving you insane
The horror that you feel unfortunately is real

Pungent oozing pus - Drives you to disgust
Vomit on the floor - Can't withstand the gore
