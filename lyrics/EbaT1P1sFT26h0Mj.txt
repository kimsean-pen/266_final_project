I'll walk this long road
Till I find my way home
To somewhere familiar
To lay down my bones
The trouble is, nothing looks the same
The trouble is, I don't think it ever will

Oh, have you come for me?
Oh, have you come for me?

Pull me out of the ocean
Take me up in your arms again
Cast away, with the love you send
Such a strange education
Leads me into your arms again
Cast away, lost again

Stars in the dark sky
Pull my mind outside
But this conversation
Wants to bleed me dry
The trouble is, I don't know what to say
The trouble is, I don't think I ever will

Oh, have you come for me?
Oh, have you come for me?

Pull me out of the ocean
Take me up in your arms again
Cast away, with the love you send
Such a strange education
Leads me into your arms again
Cast away, lost again

...
I've walked this long road
Trying to get home
To someone familiar

Like this voice on the phone
Oh, have you come for me?

Oh, have you come for me?
Pull me out of the ocean
Take me up in your arms again
Cast away, with the love you send
Such a strange education
Sends me into your arms again
Cast away, lost again
...
Reach out
Reach out
Reach out
Reach out
Reach out and touch me
