Keep them locked away
Reduce them to strays
Clean their cuts and scrapes

Mercy, we abstain
Hope you're entertained
Snow covers the stain

Foray forever

Taught them with solace
They know a soft caress
To lower your defense

Hide all that you could
Done for the greater good
It's later understood

Foray forever
