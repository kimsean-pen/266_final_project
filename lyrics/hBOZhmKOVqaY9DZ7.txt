You are an iceberg It's plain to see
The rest of you does not show
It scrapes along the bottom of the sea
I want to help you
It's so hard to dig deep
Maybe that explains why you talk in your sleep

As we meet in the day we move our teeth
But still we are no where near underneath
We share some words
Like scorched birds
We seem to gray
And wither away

I am an iceberg It's plain to see
The rest of me does not show
It scrapes along the bottom of the sea
I have a crack somewhere beneath me
Maybe that explains why I can't always feel

As we meet in the day we move our teeth
But still we are no where near underneath
We share some words
Like scorched birds
We seem to gray
And wither away
