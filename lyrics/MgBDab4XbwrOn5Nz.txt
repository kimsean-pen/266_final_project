Look at me, here I am, I'm givin' all of my lovin'
Everyday of my life, to you
All you see, can be yours, if you show me, you want me
And just one, little hint will do

And I know, I give too much
And there is much that I sacrifice
But I've got all the reasons
When I look into your eyes

I know I love you even though I shouldn't
And you should know I've tried to stop

But you've got that somethin'
Somethin' I can't describe
It gives me that feelin'
It gives me that freakin' vibe

That makes me feel so fine
Makes it worth waitin'
Until the day that you will be mine, all mine

You decide to take your time, I just want you to know that
I'll always be here for you friends keep tellin' me
"You gotta let go", they say that I'm too good for you
And maybe that is true

But I'll just keep on lovin' you the way I did before
And you should know I've tried to stop

But you've got that somethin'
Somethin' I can't describe
It gives me that feelin'
It gives me that freakin' vibe

That makes me feel so fine
Makes it worth waitin'
Until the day that you will be mine

Somethin' so hard to find
And it keeps buggin' me
And I can't get you outta my mind
Oh no, no, no

Baby
Oh, you give me that feelin' baby, that feelin' baby
That freaky, freaky feelin' baby, baby, baby, baby
So let's do it again

'Cause you've got that somethin'
Somethin' I can't describe
It gives me that feelin'
It gives me that freakin' vibe

That makes me feel so fine
Makes it worth waitin'
Until the day that you will be mine

Somethin' so hard to find
And it keeps buggin' me
And I can't get you outta my mind
Oh no, no, no, no, no
