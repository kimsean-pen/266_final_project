Getting in there
Is the easiest part
Just keep your head down

It's finding meaning
Once you're in there
That's hard

refrain:
What's the point of speech
When all I do with it
Is just repeating myself

refrain2:
What's the point of a soul
When all I'm being is
A faulty copy of myself

But if you get off
Then I get off

What's the meaning of
Covering up yourself when
You are who you were born

What's the meaning of
Doing things that you
Obviously think are wrong

If you take one more step
I'll be behind you
To put my foot
Where yours were first

If you say one more clever thing
I'll just repeat it
And act like I said it first
