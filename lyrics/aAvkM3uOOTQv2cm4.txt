I don't want a love
that's burnin' fast
Ten to one
Ah that it won't last
Now I take a love
that's burnin' slow
Then bend an eye
and watch it grow

Let's make it last
Let's make it good
Let's make it last
Let's make it good
Whoa Lord

I don't want a love
Like apple pie
good while it lasts
Aww when it's gone you wanna cry
I don't want a love
like sunny day
out come the clouds
chase it away

Let's make it last
Let's make it good
Let's make it last
Let's make it good

Whoa Lord!

Whooooooooa
Whoa Lord

I don't want a love
like a race car
Hey, win today
and lose tomorrow
I don't want a love
that's burnin' fast
ten to one, hey baby
It won't last
