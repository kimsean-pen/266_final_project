I watch them slither through their lives with a knife in their hands
While the blade in their own back
They still can't fucking understand

Deceivers amongst themselves
Rotating their own vale closer to its eradication
The spineless serpents sink their teeth into the
skin of the ones they betrayed who bit back for revenge
The cycle never ends
Betrayers portraying, false degrading
Straight for the throat

I watch a world turn cold
This is the end of times
This is the darkest spawn

Creatures of this land formulating their extermination
Bastards of the damned abandoning their own creation
Faithless misery, turning their backs on their own families

I watch a world turn cold
This is the end of times
This is the darkest spawn
None of us are fucking safe
In a sick world full of snakes
This is the end of times
This is the darkest spawn
