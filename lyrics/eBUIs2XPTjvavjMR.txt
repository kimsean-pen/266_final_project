We're the silence that wakes your day
We're the song of your neighbor fighting room
We're the sirens across the street
Where the lane there becomes an avenue

Oh, we're right under your nose
We're the lovers that you don't know
Baby, we go and you follow
we are the lovers, the lovers you don't know

We're the lovers that you don't know
We're the song of your neighbor fighting room
We're the sirens across the street
Where the lane there becomes an avenue

Oh, we're right under your nose
We're the lovers that you don't know
Baby, we go and you follow
we are the lovers, the lovers you don't know
