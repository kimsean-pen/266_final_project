There's bound to be a ghost at the back of your closet
No matter where you live
There'll all ways be a few things, maybe several things
That you're gonna find really difficult to forgive

There's gonna come a day when you'll feel better
You'll rise up free and easy on that day
And float from branch to branch lighter than the air
Just when that day is coming, who can say? Who can say?

Our mother has been absent
Ever since we founded Rome
But there's gonna be a party when the wolf comes home

We're gonna comandeer the local airwaves
To tell the neighbors what's going on
And they will shake their heads and wag their bony fingers
In all the wrong directions and by daybreak we'll be gone

I'm gonna get myself in fighting trim
Scope out every angle of unfair advantage
I'm gonna bribe the officals; I'm gonna kill all the judges
It's gonna take you people years to recover from all of the damage

Our mother has been absent
Ever since we founded Rome
But there's gonna be a party when the wolf comes home
