Know what you doin' to me?
Findin' a way to live
Givin' it everything
Know what you doin' to me?
There's something inside of me
It's hopeful, but bittersweet.
I think in time you will see
The memories never fade
Time, we will feel the pain
I really hope you agree
I did what I said I would
Doing the things I should

Finally, I am seeing it clearer
Finally, we can be who we are

Know what you doin' in me?
There's nothing to forgive
Giving it everything
Know what you doin' to me?
We see what we want to see
God in a memory
I think it's time we let be
Things that we couldn't change
Won't make that mistake again
God, in my heart I believe
We do what we know we should
Headin' to something good.

Finally, I am seein' it clearer
Finally, we can be who we are
Finally, the future seems nearer
Finally, we can be who we are

Inside of this, feels right to trust nobody
You know it's time to go our separate ways
Inside of this, feels right to trust nobody
You know it's time to go our separate ways

Finally
Never knew it would be this hard
Didn't ever think we'd grow apart.
Never knew it would be so hard
Didn't ever think we would grow apart.
