Look back in silence;
The cradle of your whole life.
There in the distance,
Loosing its greatest pride.
Nothing is easy,
Nothing is sacred.
Why?
Where did the bow break?
It happened before your time.

There were people there, lovely as you'd ever care.
Tonight.
Baby you can start again.
Laughing in the open air
Have yourself another dream?
Tonight.
Baby we can start again.

Only the young can break away, break away.
Lost when the wind blow; on your own, ohh.
Only the young can break away, break away.
Lost when the wind blow; on your own, ohh...

Mother its cold here.
Father thy will be done.
Thunder and lightening are crashing down.
They got me on the run, direct me to the sun.
Redemption keeps my covers clean
Tonight.
Baby we can start again.

Only the young can break away, break away.
Lost when the wind blow; on your own, ohh...
Only the young can break away, break away.
Lost when the wind blow; on your own, ohh...

And the sun will shine again.
And the sun will shine again.
Are you looking for a sign?
Or are you caught up in the lie?
Ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha
Only the young can break away, break away.
Lost when the wind blow; on your own, ohh...
Only the young can break away, break away.
Lost when the wind blow; on your own, ohh...
Only the young can...
Lost when the wind blow...
Only the young can...
Ha ha ha ha ha
Lost when the wind blow...
