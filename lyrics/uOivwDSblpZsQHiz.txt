Lying awake at night
I wipe the sweat from my brow
But it's not the fear
'Cause I'd rather go now
Trying to visualise the horrors that will lay ahead
The desert sand mound
A burial ground
When it comes to the time are we partners in crime?
When it comes to the time we'll be ready to die

God, let us go now
And finish what's to be done
Thy Kingdom Come
Thy shall be done, on Earth
Trying to justify to ourselves the reasons to go
Should we live and let live
Forget or forgive
But how can we let them go on this way?
The reign of terror, corruption must end
And we know, deep down there's no other way
No trust, no reasoning, no more to say

Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers

Afraid...
Afraid to shoot strangers, afraid...
Afraid to shoot strangers, afraid...
Afraid to shoot strangers, afraid...
Afraid to shoot strangers, afraid...
Afraid to shoot strangers, afraid...
Afraid to shoot strangers, afraid...
Afraid to shoot strangers, afraid...
Afraid to shoot strangers

Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers
