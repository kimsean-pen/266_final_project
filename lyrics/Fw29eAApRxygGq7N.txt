My friend, I've let you down
I'm writing to the sound
Of the pain you once possessed
So long ago
When time was everything
The echoes still resound
From a place where everything
Seemed possible

I've wasted so much time
On waiting for you to see how much
You threw away
When time meant everything
Your promise fell apart
And I stood here without a way
To recover

My friend, you let me down
I'm writing to the sound
Of the pain I once possessed
So long ago
When trust was everything
The promise still resounds
From a place where everything
Seemed possible
