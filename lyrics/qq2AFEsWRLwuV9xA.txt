Blue morn London
Riding down the whitest hall
New like a stardawn
All of these streets with the shadows of the ones we've loved
And the hopes that we go for
Wolf - like and warn
You seem to show me how, show me how
My love is a room
My love is a open room for you
Because you are iridescent, my love
My love
You are iridescent, my love
My love
Love
And I was homeless
Caressed by the hands of god
From the windows I saw
All of my homes
In my head a few years from now
That I am open to
Cause you are iridescent, my love
My love
You are iridescent, my love
My love
Love
You are iridescent, my love
My love
