All this time running 'round
Legs and limbs
Millions of eyes
Searching, pulling, and devouring
Spoke before you shared the light
Why we lecture burning ground
Up the hill and down the hall
We try so hard
Try hard
But our time is stowed away

So I keep on running
So I keep on running
So I keep on running
So I keep on running

Up the hill, down the hall
You choose to do the walking
Up the hill, down the hall
You choose to do the walking

So I keep on running
So I keep on running
So I keep on running
