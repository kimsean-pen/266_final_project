Wish for what you never had
Wish for what you never had
Beg for words you've never heard
That told them to keep waving at the star
Told them to be beautiful...
But will they ever know who you are
Can they be all you ever needed
When those hands are not for tying.

I will let you shine, like the most sincere, little lie,
It will grow on you like tender force brutal love
Tender force brutal love

Closer to what you've become or to what you've never shown
Like a china-voice in a crowd
All her glory might come to overthrow you
With eyelids closed, it's time you let it go.
Can they be all you ever needed
When those hands are not for tying.

I will let you shine, like the most sincere, little lie,
It will grow on you like tender force brutal love
Tender force brutal love

I will let you shine, like the most sincere, little lie,
It will grow on you like tender force brutal love
Tender force, infralove
