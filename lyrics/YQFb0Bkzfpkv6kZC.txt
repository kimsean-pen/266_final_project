Dark skies will call me
Closer, so softly
Angels are falling
Your voice is calling

I won't cry now cause I'm in Heaven with you
I can die now cause I'm in Heaven with you
I won't lie now cause I'm in Heaven with you
I can fly now cause I'm in Heaven with you

Eyes wide, see nothing
Death is out hunting
He won't take my soul
Your touch makes me whole

I won't cry now cause I'm in Heaven with you
I can die now cause I'm in Heaven with you
I won't lie now cause I'm in Heaven with you
I can fly now cause I'm in Heaven with you

I won't cry now cause I'm in Heaven with you
I can die now cause I'm in Heaven with you
I won't lie now cause I'm in Heaven with you
I can fly now cause I'm in Heaven with you

I won't cry now cause I'm in Heaven with you
I can die now cause I'm in Heaven with you
I won't lie now cause I'm in Heaven with you
I can fly now cause I'm in Heaven with you
