I must write a letter to you
I must make myself clear
It's spot on time, right on cue
I am a clam, somebody said to me

It's obscene, there must be a motive behind
It's obscure there must be someone behind

A Muscovite Mosquito
A Muscovite Mosquito
A Muscovite Mosquito
A Muscovite Mosquito

A vivid image anyway
Someone said
You're a clam, consider this

Listen, oh, listen to me, you're far
A thousand miles away from here
I am here, I am here
In this ooze through country
Trampled down by mega people

A dispute will never end
A retrospection, it sounds obscene
A disconnection
A final balance sheet

For Muscovite Mosquito
For Muscovite Mosquito
It sounds obscene

It sounds so obscure
For Muscovite Mosquito
My final, my final balance sheet is gone for

For Muscovite Mosquito
I'm Muscovite Mosquito
I'm Muscovite Mosquito

It's spot on time, right on cue
You missed the chance
Somebody vexedly said

It's obscene, there must be motives behind
It's obscure, there must be someone behind
