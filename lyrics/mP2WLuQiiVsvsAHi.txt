Looking from the window above
Its like a story of love.
Can you hear me?
Came back only yesterday,
Moving farther away.
Want you near me.

All I needed was the love you gave.
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew;
Only you.

Sometimes when I think of her name
When it's only a game
And I need you.
Listen to the words that you say,
It's getting harder to stay
When I see you.

All I needed was the love you gave.
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew;
Only you.

All I needed was the love you gave.
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew;
Only you.

This is gonna take a long time
And I wonder what's mine.
Can't take no more. (Can't take no more)
Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand,
Behind closed doors.

All I needed was the love you gave.
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew; (All I ever knew)
Only you.
