Girls that glitter love the dark
We lace it through our bitter, black little hearts
And then we feign surprise when we see
that those we've loved to love have seeped
into our poisoned blood
Girls that glitter deceive death
We thread ourselves through innocent flesh
And then we feign surprise when we see
that those we've love to waste
they seem to be erased
Knit it through, thread it
Sew it to unsuspecting flesh
They won't regret it
Or so they say
And those you have loved
have snagged on your thorny veins
But they don't regret it
Or so you say
Girls that glitter desecrate a kiss
We break the code of happiness
And then we feign surprise when we see
That those we've loved have loved to leave
Girls that glitter defile hope
We think that love is just
tightening that sad little rope
And then we open our eyes and we see
through the gash
of a fluttering eyelash
We see love trying desperately to flee
But you don't ever have to fear
Just break its wings and it will never disappear
You don't ever have to fear
Just break its wings and it will never disappear
Knit it through
Capture it and stitch it to
your brittle little heart
At least that way
love can't tear it apart
Knit it through
Sew it to
They won't regret you
And if they do?
But the thing that girls know best
is that glitter covers all the ugliness
And they know one thing above the rest:
Sparkle covers evilness
Shimmer covers all the mess
Glitter covers darkness
And then came the moment
when the swarm of bees drowned
