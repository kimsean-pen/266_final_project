Early in the morning
She's running through my mind again
Girl, you got me wondering
If we should be more than friends

Do you wanna be?
Do you wanna be?
Do you wanna be?
Don't you wanna be my girl? (Girl)
(Girl, girl, girl, girl)
My girl, girl
Yeah, yeah

Every single evening
She's telling me about her day
My feelings getting creeping
I wonder if it's fair to say

Does she wanna be?
Does she wanna be?
Does she wanna be?
I think she wanna be my girl
My girl, oh (girl)
Damn

I don't know
Pretty sure though
It's like
I think she wants to be (girl, girl, girl)
At least I hope she does, shit
Girl, yea, ooh oh
Ta-da, ta-da

I think she wanna be
I think she wanna be
I think she wanna be
I think she wanna be my girl (girl, girl, girl)
My girl

Girl (girl)
Girl (girl)
Girl (girl)
