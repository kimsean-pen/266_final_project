Stonewall - go to bat
Unless you want to live like that
Stonewall - can't we see
We're our own worst enemy

Stonewall - go to bat
Unless you want to live like that
Stonewall - can't we see
We're our own worst enemy

A land said to have all, wealth in land, in man
Qualities soon to exhaust, as man's greed poisons the land
Streams, once fresh, were centres of life for so many a creature
Beauty without defence, polluted, never to replenish

Stonewall - go to bat
Unless you want to live like that
Stonewall - can't we see
We're our own worst enemy

Collage, blue and green, seen as golden industrial sites
Smudge as toxic pollutants destroy her remaining rights
The power of corporations, spewing chemicals into the air
Fines are imposed to discourage, but what's a dime to a millionaire

Stonewall - go to bat
Unless you want to live like that
Stonewall - can't we see
We're our own worst enemy

It's time to listen, and see the signs
It's time to listen and hear her cries

The one that gave us life is being burnt to the raw
Reaping unprotected riches, human nature's self-destruction flaw
The power of corporations, spewing chemicals into the air
Fines are imposed to discourage, but what's a dime to a millionaire

Stonewall - go to bat
Unless you want to live like that
Stonewall - can't we see
We're our own worst enemy

Stonewall - go to bat
Unless you want to live like that
Stonewall - can't we see
We're our own worst enemy
