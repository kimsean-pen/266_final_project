I've Been Traveling For So Long
So Lost Til' I Stumbled Upon
Two Roads In Front Of Me
I Had To Take My Time
To The Right I Could See A Church
I Took A Step In That Direction First
But, To The Left There Was A Watering Hole Where They Were Whiskey Drunk And Now That's Where I Wanna Pray
The Fun Down Here Goes On And On
If I Was Perfect, Then This Would Be Easy
Either roads isPlausible On Both I Could Drown
I Walk Through The Center, With No Rules To Guide Me
I Realize It's Difficult
But Now I Can See
There's Gotta Be Another Way To Go
A Way That's Much More Feasible
A Combination Of All These Lies A Central Path Without Choosing A Side
I Make Decisions, One At A Time
And No I Never Say That I'm Always Right
I'm Confident That When I Stand On My Own You'll See The Truest Form Of A Man When I'm Shining Through
The Fun Down Here Goes On And On
If I Was Perfect, Then This Would Be Easy
Either roads is Plausible On Both I Could Drown
I Walk Through The Center, With No Rules To Guide Me
I Realize It's Difficult
But Now I Can See
Oh
I Hear Them Now All Their Religious Right
(You're A Sinner, You're A Sinner, You're A Sinner)
The Left Isn't Better It's Just More Of The Same
Condeming All These People For What They Believe
I'll Climb To The Top Of The Mountian Again
No Harness Up To Save Me This Way
And The Closer To The Top I Get The More They Take Aim
But I'm Not You
I May Not Be Perfect But I've Always Been True
I May Not Be Worthy In Your Eyes
Climb Up From The Bottom For The Last Time
(The Last One, The Last One, The Last Time)
If I Was Perfect, Then This Would Be Easy
Even Though It's Plausible On Both I Could Drown
I Walk Through The Center, With No Rules To Guide Me
I Realize It's Difficult
But Now I Can See, Yeah!
