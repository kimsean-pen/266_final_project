I am slowly pushing on
Bruised but only waiting
To run run run - away
To run away

You better hide love, hide love, across the water
You better hide love, hide love, you know you oughta

Thoughts that hold me, I'm caught again
What's worse I'm only lingering
To run run run - away
To run away

You better hide love, hide love, across the water
You better hide love, hide love, you know you oughta

No more - No

You're high, you're high above the water
Do you never, never look below
To run run run - away
Run away

Better hide love, hide love, across the water
Better hide love, hide love, you know we oughta

No more, no, no more

No more, no, no more
No more, no, no more
No more, no, no more
No

Hide love, hide love water
