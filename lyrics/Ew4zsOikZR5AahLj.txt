While you were out the message says
You left a number and I tried to call but they
Wrote it down in a
Perfect Spanish scrawl
Perfect Spanish scrawl

Yet again, I'm missing you
It's a king size bed in a hotel someplace
I hear your name
I see your face
I see your face

The back street dolls and the side door johnnies
And the wide eyed boys with their bags full of money
Back in the alley going bang to the wall
Tied to the tail of a midnight crawl
Heaven wouldn't be so high, I know
If the times gone by hadn't been so low
The best laid planscome apart at the seams
And shatter all my dreams

Sometimes I feel like screaming

Close my eyes
It's times like these my head goes down
The only thing I know is the name of this town
Name of this town

Yet again, I'm missing you
It won't be long
I'm coming home
Until that distant time I'll be moving on
I'll be moving on

The back street dolls and the side door johnnies
And the wide eyed boys with their bags full of money
Back in the alley going bang to the wall
Tied to the tail of a midnight crawl
Heaven wouldn't be so high, I know
If the times gone by hadn't been so low
The best laid planscome apart at the seams
And shatter my dreams

It's only the name
Oh yeah, It's only the name, oh
It's only the name
It's only the name

The back street dolls and the side door johnnies
And the wide eyed boys with their bags full of money
Back in the alley going bang to the wall
Tied to the tail of a midnight crawl
Heaven wouldn't be so high, I know
If the times gone by hadn't been so low
The best laid planscome apart at the seams
And shatter all my dreams
