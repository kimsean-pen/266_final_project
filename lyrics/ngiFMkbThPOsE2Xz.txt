Sometimes I just wanna be on my own
Sometimes i just wanna be alone
At times I only need the radio on (just the radio)
But guess who's on the radio now?
They got me pumpin' on the radio
Turn off the stereo

Chorus:
I wanna live tonight
I wanna feel alive
Lets fall in love tonight
And leave this world behind

Ding don din don ei

You some kind of beautiful thing
Right now, I really want you
Somehow lost in the night
I found myself coming undone
In the instant I decided you're the one
And with the halo that are above your head

I'm save in your arms

Chorus:
I wanna live tonight
I wanna feel alive
Lets fall in love tonight
And leave this world behind

Ding don din don ei
uuuuh uuuuuh uuh
(Ding don din don ei)
uuuuh uhhh uuh

Chorus:
I wanna live tonight
I wanna feel alive
Lets fall in love tonight
And leave this world behind
