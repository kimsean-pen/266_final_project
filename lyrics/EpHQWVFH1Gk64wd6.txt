Broken by the love
This hurt divides itself
Decided that kissing you is bad for my health

So I'm gonna ride
I'm going the other way
I would've told you why
If there was any space for me
To say, to say

Oh, don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while
Oh, don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while

I looked you right in your eye
And asked you why it has to be this way
I don't know
And to my suprise, you did say
This is just you and I babe
You and I babe

Oh, don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while
Oh, don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while

So I'm gonna ride
I'm going the other way
I would've told you why
If there was any space for me
To say, to say

Oh, don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while
Oh, don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while
