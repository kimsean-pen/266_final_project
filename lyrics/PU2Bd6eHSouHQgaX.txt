Love of my life, I love you so
Love of my life, don't ever go
I love you only
Love, love of my life

Stars in the sky they never lie
Tell me you need me, don't say goodbye
I love you only
Love, love of my life

Stars in the sky, they never lie
Tell me you need me, don't say goodbye
I love you darling, I love you only
Don't ever leave me
Don't make me, don't make me
Don't make me lonely

Love of my life, I love you so
Love of my life, don't ever go
I love you only
Love, love of my life
