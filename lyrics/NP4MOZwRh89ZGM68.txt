And now the marriage vow is very sacred
The man has put us together
Now you ought to make it stick together
Come on, come on and stick together

You know we made a vow
To leave one another never

But now you never miss your water till your well runs dry
Come on now baby give our love a try
Let's stick together
Come on, come on let's stick together

You know we made a vow
To leave one another never

Well, if you're stuck for a while consider our child
How can it be happy without its ma and pa
Please stick together
Come on, come on let's stick together

You know we made a vow
To leave one another never

Now if you're stuck for a while consider our child
How can it be happy without its ma and pa
Please stick together
Come on, come on let's stick together

You know we made a vow
To leave one another never
