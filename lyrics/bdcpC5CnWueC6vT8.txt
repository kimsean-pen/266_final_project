Someday you might find your hero
Some say you might lose your mind
I keeping my head down now for the summer
I'm outta my mind let me pull the other
I'm gonna take that tiger outside for a ride

What a life!
What a life!

Keep on chasing down that rainbow
You'll never know what you might find
Over the sunset on the horizon
Maybe you dream but it tastes like poison
I'm gonna take that tiger outside for a ride

What a life!
What a life!
What a life!
What a life!

What a life!
What a life!
What a life!
What a life!

Someday you might find your hero
Some say you might lose your mind
