Makeup and all dressed up
Lace lingerie, red wine
Make myself feel damn fine
Not meeting anybody
Chocolate on strawberries
Save all your empathy
I'm on a date with me
Not needing anybody
"Heavy weight? Let me get that"
Hard to get, Hard to get back
I don't, I don't need your strength
no more I can open up a door on my own

Up all night
I don't give a fuck, I might
just think of me, myself, and I
When I'm without you
Don't mind me
Loving my own company, I don't need a somebody
When I'm without you
Here in my kingsize bed
Roses all over it
Enjoying it all alone
I'm just gonna love my body
I can be good and bad'
Fill all my needs like that
I am the best I've had I'm in love with my own body
"Heavy weight? Let me get that"
Hard to get, Hard to get back
I don't, I don't need your strength
no more I can open up a door on my own

Up all night
I don't give a fuck, I might
just think of me, myself, and I
When I'm without you
Don't mind me
Loving my own company, I don't need a somebody
When I'm without you

When I'm without, without you
One is better than two
I forget that, it was me and you

don't mind me, don't mind me
don't mind me, don't mind me
don't mind me, don't mind me
Up all night
I don't give a fuck, I might
just think of me, myself, and I
When I'm without you
Don't mind me
Loving my own company, I don't need a somebody
When I'm without you
When I'm without, without you
One is better than two
I forget that, it was me and you
