By the time you get over here
We will be gone
Everybody knows
We don't wait long
Some people say it's cause
We're on the run
People will talk
I heard them saying we look broken and gaunt
I heard them saying we look weathered and old
I heard them saying we were out of control
And you say
Don't stop looking around your shoulder
It's all that lying its making you bolder
It's all that crying it's making you older
It's time, It's time
To get a grip
We were constant runners
And when the going got tough
We'd leave it all in our dust
We were constant runners
Till the day finally came
When we ran straight out of luck
Runner, runner
Just keep on running
Runner, runner
Just keep on running
Now I look back
Perhaps it's fair to say you had a point
But in our defence we weren't alone
There were others
It felt like the whole world
Was running too
Don't stop looking around your shoulder
It's all that lying its making you bolder
It's all that crying its making you older
It's time, It's time
To get a grip
We were constant runners
And when the going got tough
We'd leave it all in our dust
We were constant runners
Till the day finally came
When we ran straight out of luck
We were constant runners
We were running away from the world
From ourselves
We were constant runners
Thought we were leaving it all behind
It's all gonna catch you up
We were constant runners
And when the going got tough
We'd leave it all in our dust
We were constant runners
Till the day finally came
When we ran straight out of luck
We were constant runners
We were running away from the world
From ourselves
We were constant runners
Thought we were leaving it all behind
