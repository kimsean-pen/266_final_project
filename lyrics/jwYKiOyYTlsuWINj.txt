Opening my eyes
Clouds go floating by
For a while
I see your smile
For a while I go high...
For a while I see your smile
Just for a while
I go high...

Now we fall in sleep
Ever lost you know
I could cry, in your eyes
I could cry, when we try

I could die in your smile
I could cry in your eyes
Makes me happy
I go high...
I go high
I go high
