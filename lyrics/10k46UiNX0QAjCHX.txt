When the money's gone, will you be my friend
Float a small row boat, till a ship comes in
When the winter nights, chills us to the soul
Will you feed the fire
Spin the straw to gold
When the money's gone

When the money's gone, will you get cold feet
Will you still be there, if the ends don't meet
If we're in the red, just forget the green
Take a bus with me, no more limousines
When the money's gone
Will you still want me

Oh what a fine life, I give to you
All you ever want (ever want)
Oh will you still be there
Will you pull me through
When the cash don't come
Ohooh if you're mine
Will you still love me
Wherever we fall
When the money's gone

Oh will you want me baby

Oh will you need me baby (oh will you need me)

Oh will you love me baby

When the money's gone

Money money money's all gone

When the money's gone babe babe babe babe babe
When the money's gone babe babe babe babe babe

When the money's gone
No more caviar
Will you eat fast food in a beat up car
Live life modestly, lost in lotto dreams
Will you find your way
Through it all with me
Through it all with me

Will you still love me

Oh what a fine life I give to you
All you ever want (ever want)
Oh will you still be there
Will you pull me through
When the cash don't come

Ohooh if you're mine
Will you still love me
Wherever we fall

When the money's gone

Oh will you want me baby

Oh will you need me baby (oh will you need me)

Oh will you love me baby

When the money's gone

Money money money's all gone

When the money's gone babe babe babe babe babe (when the money's all gone)
When the money's gone babe babe babe babe babe
When the money's gone babe babe babe babe babe

And a mile off the shore
Flies a bird who'll land no more
And as the tide pulls the sea

So you always will pull me

Forever more, forever forever

Oh what a fine life I give to you
All you ever want (ever want)
Oh will you still be there
Will you pull me through
When the cash don't come

Ohooh if you're mine
Will you still love me
Wherever we fall

When the money's gone

Oh will you want me baby

Oh will you need me baby (oh will you need me)

Oh will you love me baby

When the money's gone

When the money's all gone

Oh will you want me baby (it's gone)

Oh will you need me baby (when the money's all gone)

Oh will you love me baby

When the money's gone (gone)

When the money's gone babe babe babe babe babe

When the money's all gone, it's gone

Oh gone, gone, gone

When the money's all gone

The money's gone

Oooh the money's gone

Oooh the money's gone

Oooh the money's gone

Mmmh the money's gone

When the money's gone

Oooh the money's gone

Oooh the money's gone
