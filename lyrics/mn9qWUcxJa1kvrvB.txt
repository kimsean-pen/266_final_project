All the lies don't hold me,

But they're sinking in my skin,

Coursing through my veins

And the truth eludes me,

Losing sight of it again

Save me from myself

Close my eyes, see my life

Have I lost my way?

I hope this is the last time

Am I here to stay?

Nowhere left to hide

There's always a way to find the reason in a moment

Yeah, moment, yeah moment

To find the reason in a moment

Yeah, moment, yeah moment

To find the reason

There is truth inside me

But it feels out of reach

Will it come to me?

And you'll walk beside me

I'll see things that you see

Will you wait for me?

Close my eyes, see my life

Have I lost my way?

I hope this is the last time

Am I here to stay?

Nowhere left to hide
There's always a way
To find the reason!
Save your future for me
Save your time
Save your future for me
Save my life, save my life
Save your future for me
Save your time
Save your future for me
Save my life, save my life
Close my eyes, see my life
Close my eyes, see my life
Have I lost my way?
I hope this is the last time
Am I here to stay?
Nowhere left to hide
There's always a way to find the reason in a moment
Yeah, moment, yeah moment
To find the reason in a moment
Yeah, moment, yeah moment
To find the reason in a moment
Yeah, moment, yeah moment
To find the reason in a moment
Yeah, moment, yeah moment
To find the reason!
