Birds sing out of tune, songs with no refrain
Nested in purple trees, nothing seems to rhyme

Only when I'm dreaming
Is there harmony and meaning
Only when I'm dreaming of you

Empty hour glass; running out of time
Yesterday is here
Now will never pass

Only when I'm Dreaming
Is there harmony and meaning
I am only dreaming when I'm deeper in the arms
The arms of love
The arms of love

Birds are now in tune
Since I'm with you
Songs have sweet refrain
Since I'm with you
