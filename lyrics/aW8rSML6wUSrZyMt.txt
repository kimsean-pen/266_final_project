Must've been forces
That took me on them wild courses
Who knows how many poses
That I've been in
But them the main closest
Hark! It gives meaning mine
I cannot really post this, I flee the signs

I worry 'bout rain
And I worry 'bout lightning
But I watch them off
To the light of the morning

Marking the slope
Slung low in the highlands
(Where the days have no numbers)
If it's harmed, it's harmed me, it'll harm, I'll let it in

Oh, the old modus
Out to be leading live
Said, comes the old ponens
Demit to strive
A worry about Gnosis
It ain't gonna buy the groceries
Or middle-out locusts, or weigh to find

I hurry 'bout shame
And I worry 'bout a worn path
And I wander off
Just to come back home
Turning to waltz
Hold high in the lowlands
('Cause the days have no numbers)
It harms me, it harms me, it harms me like a lamb

So I can depose this
Partial to the bleeding vines
Suppose you can't hold shit
How high I've been
What a river don't know is
To climb out and heed a line
To slow among roses or stay behind

I've been to that grove
Where no matter the source is
And I walked it off
How long I'd last
Soaring to cope
Whole band on the canyon
(When the days have no numbers)
Well it harms me, it harms me, it harms me, I'll let it in
