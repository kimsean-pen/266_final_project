Staring
Through a broken window
Looking at the snow covered streets below
We don't have to stop right now
It only hurts when the night runs out
You said you're tired and you wanted to go home
Is this what the clouds feel like?
Never really happy, just quiet and polite
Surrounded and lonely at the same time
Don't you wish it was Friday forever?
Don't you wish the sun never came up?
Don't you miss being day drunk together?
I'd still be waiting if you ever get stuck
Don't you wish it was Friday forever?
Don't you wish the sun never came up?
Don't you miss being day drunk together?
I'd still be waiting if you ever get stuck
Slow down, take a moment with me
Got no where to go and I've got no one to be
Do you remember how we felt when we were all together?
Only ones left awake in the world
Counting the stars
Is this what the clouds feel like?
Is this what the clouds feel like?
Is this what the clouds feel like?
Never really happy, just quiet and polite
Is this what the clouds feel like?
Is this what the clouds feel like?
Is this what the clouds feel like?
Surrounded and lonely at the same time
Don't you wish it was Friday forever?
Don't you wish the sun never came up?
Don't you miss being day drunk together?
I'd still be waiting if you ever get stuck
Don't you wish it was Friday forever?
Don't you wish the sun never came up?
Don't you miss being day drunk together?
I'd still be waiting if you ever get stuck
Is this what the clouds feel like?
Is this what the clouds feel like?
Is this what the clouds feel like?
Is this what the clouds feel like?

Is this what the clouds feel like?
Never really happy, just quiet and polite
Surrounded and lonely at the same time
