I believe in a white stretch limousine,
with you in the back and it drives me up the wall
Tenderly I scrape you off the seat
and pretend that I'm a stranger to it all

Love lost, there's no love lost,
in this loveless carry on now,
there's no love left, was there ever any?

Words can stain like red wine on your
teeth, you can scrub but they will always remain
Is this defeat?
No tricks left up my sleeve just a
broken back from a heart that weighs a ton.

Love lost, there's no love lost,
in this loveless carry on now,
there's no love left, was there ever any?

If you know me, oh-oh, you should show me, oh-oh
Getting heavy, oh-oh getting lonely

If you know me, oh-oh, you should show me, oh-oh
Getting heavy, oh-oh getting lonely

Love lost, there's no love lost,
in this loveless carry on now,
there's no love left there's no feeling.

Love lost, there's no love lost, in this loveless,
carry on now, there's no love left, was there ever any?

I've got no love left
I've got no love left
