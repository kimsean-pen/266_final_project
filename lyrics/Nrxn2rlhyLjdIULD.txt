It's perilous and all our men shall need courage
For you see, for years as we wanted an opportunity
And now we know the adventure for which Argo's ship was destined

It's the Hermit and the Recluse
One sermon, one produce

From bummy to one hundred when he sold a pocket
Flow aquatic, known alone for my slow hypnotic
Though some fault and throw salt, kept a low systolic
Toast with five holsters from live culture, probiotic
My darts hit the mark on target, never overshot it
Infinite temperament, if mentioned it, know I got it
They tasked to play wit' you, I'm on a path past aspirational
Hope you saving data, we labelled the craft and create for you
Where clips devour scripts of power, this what I was made to do
That steady feeling straight to you?
Ready, willing, capable
Appear rain hits, couldn't get a miss, thirst was insatiable
Bowed and vowed to my mythology, put my faith in you
(Our father, who art in heaven
Hallows, hallows)

Mourned, he cried on the wrong side of the hardest track
Discover they supply you lies, I'm more artifact
I might touch illustrious, even though I started wack
Mind you a smarter rap what I rhyme for my cardiac
Spoke for grimy, hope you find me timely, when you need it
They rappers bad for the hatchlings, Im tryna' supersede it
What stalked this lion, brought the iron, they was too anaemic
Was ripe to fall, see writing on the wall, (few could read it)
My discretionary tales, for some unnecessary
For some irrelevant
The people love me deeply 'cus I speak that ugly elegant
True what I do is hood intel, intelligent
Ain't bold enough to hold your goal? Then air you out your element
If what you provide is not inspiring, I'm not amused
What word hurt me, Euterpe was the 9 I used
Hope you pick appropriate when this shit time to choose
Our boys hard as Spartans, if not trying hardest you try and lose
To shower in violence, begot violence, hate begot hate
They now surmising surviving all that, begot great
For pennys many in a night icing, try and stack cake
The more was rewarded if they draw, and you react late

Won't peep weakness though, my scars show
Disappearing history only hero on that argo
Some bail, set sail every harp blow
I'd rather stand, be the man, the gods know
