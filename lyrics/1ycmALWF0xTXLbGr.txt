They call it, a marijuana cigarette

Mmmhhh

Darlin' do you see the fright?
I'm holdin' on so tight
I close my eyes in spite
Of the fact I can't sleep at night

I can hear all the noise
Laughin' with the pretty boys
Actin' so fuckin' coy
Kill the lights, Kill the joy

Well I don't need a teacher or preacher
In silver and gold
I'm not a believer, I'm good on my own
And I don't need no bitch walkin' me home
I got this on my own, I got this on my own

Hunny's gotta go get high
If he doesn't then he thinks he'll die
Well maybe baby, my oh my
That's the key to gettin' by

I can handle one through three
Hunny that's clear to see
But what isn't clear to me
Is what it fuckin' feels like to feel free
What it fuckin' feels like to feel free

Well I don't need a teacher or preacher
In silver and gold
I'm not a believer, I'm good on my own
And I don't need no bitch walkin' me home
I got this on my own, I got this on my own

Hunny's gotta go get high
If he doesn't then he thinks he'll die
Well maybe baby, my oh my
That's the key to gettin' by
That's the key to getting by
