determined by many
determined by many
determined by many
determined by many

determined by many separations,
so controlling and understated,
determined today by those of us
who refuse to conquer hesitation
i don't see anything else in this room,
i don't think so
uh oh, oh oh

you're already 22
don't waste yr life in school
you could go back anytime
and i want to see you on tour

determined by many situations,
seemingly random considerations
determined tonight by those of
you who decide to do more than
just sit on the floor
i don't see anything else in this room
i don't see you, no not at all

i'm walking down the street
i'm skating to the show
i wanna see your band play
but there's no one here i know

determined by many separations
so controlling and understated
determinded today by those of us
who refuse to conquer hesitation
i don't see anything else in this room
to prove me wrong.
