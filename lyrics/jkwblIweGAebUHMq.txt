I've got you under my skin
I have got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart, you're really a part of me
And I've got you under my skin

I have tried so, not to give in
I've said to myself this affair, it never would go so well
But why should I try to resist when I know so well
That I've got you under my skin?

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night and repeats in my ear
Don't you know you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
For each time I do, just the thought of you makes me stop before I begin
Because I've got you under my skin

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice, that comes in the night and repeats to my ear
Don't you know you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
But each time I do, just the thought of you makes me stop before I begin
Because I've got you under my skin
