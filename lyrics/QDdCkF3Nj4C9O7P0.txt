Blood red sky
On a desert road
Gotta make my way
Down to Mexico
For what I did
I know that it was wrong

The fire in my heart
It will never die
Everything I love
Will be left behind
Ain't no turning back

Forever gone tonight
All my love
Anastasia, Anastasia
This may be our last goodbye
You can't save me
I am fading

Blood is on my hands tonight
All I need's a miracle
Lawman got me
Running forevermore
They'll hunt me down
Until the end of time

Oh my mama
I've gotta go
I'll never love another
How I loved you so
I'm so afraid to

Leave this all behind
All my love
Anastasia, Anastasia
This may be our last goodbye
You can't save me
I am fading
Blood is on my hands tonight
-Solo-
All my love
Anastasia, Anastasia
This may be our last goodbye
You can't save me
I am fading
Blood is on my hands tonight
Anastasia, Anastasia
For your honour, took a life
You can't save me
I am fading
Blood is on my hands tonight
-Solo-
