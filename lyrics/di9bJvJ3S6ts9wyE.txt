I turn the music up
I've got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight
Maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song

And all the kids they dance
All the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up
I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight

I turn the music up
I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop

Maybe I'm in the black
Maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

And we saw this light
I swear you
Emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar wall
Every siren is a symphony
And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall

Oh
Is a waterfall
Oh, oh, oh
Is a is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall
Oh, oh, oh

So you can hurt
Hurt me bad
But still I'll raise the flag

Oh
It was a waterfall
A waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
