Nothing's gonna stop me now
Nothing's gonna stop me now

There was a time
I couldn't get you out of my mind
And since the day you came
You tried to take control of me

Then came the day
I thought about running away
And now my bags are packed
Don't even think of holding me back

Nothing's gonna stop me now
And I don't wanna talk it over
I said nothing's gonna stop me now
Gonna break it up, gonna take my love away
Yeah, yeah

Day after day
I started slippin' away
You took my self respect
And you made a fool of me

Time after time
I turned it 'round in my mind
And now my mind's made up
To leave the past behind me

Nothing's gonna stop me now
And I don't wanna talk it over
I said nothing's gonna stop me now
Gonna break it up, gonna take my love away

Nothing's gonna stop me
Nothing's gonna stop me now
Nothing's gonna stop me
Nothing's gonna stop me now

Time after time
I turned it 'round in my mind
And now my mind's made up
To leave the past behind me

Nothing's gonna stop me now
And I don't wanna talk it over
I said nothing's gonna stop me now
Gonna break it up, gonna take my love away

Nothing's gonna stop me now
And I don't wanna talk it over
I said nothing's gonna stop me now
Gonna break it up, gonna take my love away

Nothing's gonna stop me now
And I don't wanna talk it over
I said nothing's gonna stop me now
Gonna break it up, gonna take my love away

Nothing's gonna stop me now
And I don't wanna talk it over
