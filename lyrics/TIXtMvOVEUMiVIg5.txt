Just try to think and understand
And you can fight back

Sorrow
Dishonour
Manipulation
It makes us live in agony
Hollowness
Corruption
Hypocrisy
There's no free will in our lives

You can't see what hurts
But you can feel it is strong
An invisible force acts against you
It leads you to madness

These restraints take away my strengths
It is useless to cut a sorry figure now
I know it's time for me to break these chains
I can't wait to see you flying away

Fight
Look at my face
And show all your grace
There's a feeling locked in a cage
There is no fate
If you don't try to escape
Use your mind and don't be afraid

You can't be who you are
The real you is locked inside you
Just try to think and understand
And you can fight back
