I know your name
I know the people out there feel the same
I know you're gone
I hope you got some friends to come along
I know you're out there
I know you're gone
You can't say that's fair
Can't you be wrong?
I feel ok
Sure, I know that's not what people say
Maybe they're wrong
Maybe you weren't on my side all along
I know you're out there
I know you're gone
You can't say that's fair
Can't you be wrong?
I know you're out there
You're still a case
It's still the place
Weren't you invited?
It's what you can't spare
Whatever's left, just hide the rest
And bring it right in
I know it's sick
I know you think a game is just a trick
Maybe I've changed
Just tell me was this all in vain?
I know you're out there
I know that space is not a race
Weren't you invited?
It's what you can't spare
Whatever's left, just hide the rest
And bring it right in
Maintained inside
I've lost my range
Feel the strain
Weren't you invited?
Just never try
It's still the place, you're still the case, now bring it right in
