This place is not quite what it seems
Or anything that I was told it'd be
New York, you know you make my heart skip
In my dreams I make it into Vegas.

Seattle hits me every time
I can't get Chicago off my mind
New Jersey taught me how to let go
And I've learned that's all that I need to know.

In this moment, we're connected -
If we fall, we fall together!

Get up, get up -
Sing it like you're screaming at me
Get up, get up -
I love the way you make it look so easy
East coast, west coast, show me what you've got now
Let's go, let's go!

Get up, get up -
Make my heartbeat pickup
Get up, get up -
Be-be-be-beating to the rhythm.

I spill my heart from coast to coast
Fall in love with everyone I know -
Sometimes it isn't where you're going
It's who you're with...

In this moment, we're connected -
If we fall, we fall together!

Get up, get up -
Sing it like you're screaming at me
Get up, get up -
I love the way you make it look so easy
East coast, west coast, show me what you've got now
Let's go, let's go!

Get up, get up -
Sing it like you're screaming at me
Get up, get up -
I love the way you make it look so easy
East coast, west coast, show me what you've got now
Let's go, let's go!

Get up, get up -
Make my heartbeat pickup
Get up, get up -
Be-be-be-beating to the rhythm.

Get up, get up -
Sing it like you're screaming at me
Get up, get up -
I love the way you make it look so easy
East coast, west coast, show me what you've got now
Let's go, let's go!

Get up, get up -
Sing it like you're screaming at me
Get up, get up -
I love the way you make it look so easy
East coast, west coast, show me what you've got now
Let's go, let's go!
Get up, get up -
Sing it like you're screaming at me
Get up, get up -
I love the way you make it look so easy
East coast, west coast, show me what you've got now...
