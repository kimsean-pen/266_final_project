There's a place in heaven prepared for me
When the toils of this life is over
Where the saints are clothed in white
Before the throne singing praises forever, forever more

In my Father's house there are mansions bright
If He said, then I know, I know it's true, yeah
There's a place for me beyond, beyond the sky
Brothers and sisters there is one for you

Jesus, He promised me a home over there
Jesus promised me a home over there
No more sickness, sorrow, pain or care
He promised, me a home over there

Jesus promised me a home over there
Jesus promised me a home over there
No more sickness or sorrow, pain or care
Jesus promised me a home over there
