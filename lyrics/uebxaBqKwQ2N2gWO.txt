The end crawls on the last two souls
In a barren world
All that's left is destruction
Prospect slit by a dreadful split
When the fates are done
The two sides of the whole will finally cross swords

He is the champion of unwanted souls
The defender of cowardly deviance everything that he wants
He takes it by force
He takes it no matter the cost

She is the brightest pure being of all
The descendant of mythical candor
In her conscience she keeps
The true key to be in touch with the heart of the world

You can't win this
Just step aside I'm tired of your spineless demeanor
Get on my side
Into the dark avoid your impending demise!

I'm not enticed by your words of demise
You won't lure me into joining your venture
Every blow from the dark
I'll fight back with light by wielding this Black Crystal Sword!

The ascent of primeval forces in the night ignites the ancestral fight

In the rise of primeval forces in the night
Our past and future collide

Impious Dystopia
A sentence of doom
Moving away from the truth
Wisdom is lost

Knowledge is out there for me
I will take it as I please

The ascent of primeval forces in the night ignites the ancestral fight

In the rise of primeval forces in the night
Our past and future collide

Impious Dystopia
A sentence of doom
Moving away from the truth
You're lost

Impious delirium
You chose the wrong path
It breaks my heart
I can't let you fulfill your plan
