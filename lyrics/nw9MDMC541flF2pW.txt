I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave everything that I had
But ya left me in the cold

But still I have faith
Somehow I believe
That if I keep love in my heart
It will find it's way to me

I could fight
Seek revenge
But thats not who I am
No I'm not giving in
I will rise above

I'm gonna keep walking
Though it may seem far
I'm gonna keep preaching
When life gets too hard
Not gonna let you bring me down
I'll take the high road

I'm gonna keep climbing
Till I see the top
I'm gonna keep trying
Though I may get lost
Not gonna let you bring me down
I take the high road

I'm gonna get by on the high road
Yes I will
I'm gonna get by on the high road

This pain that I feel
I will overcome
I know somewhere deep down inside
It's the pain that makes us strong
I could curse
I could shout
Take the easy way out
I forgive you
somehow I will rise above

I'm gonna keep walking
Though it may seem far
I'm gonna keep preaching
When life gets too hard
Not gonna let you bring me down
I take the high road

I'm gonna keep climbing
Till I see the top
I'm gonna keep trying
Though I may get lost
Not gonna let you bring me down
I take the high road

I get by
To be real
I can't keep it inside
I may fall sometimes
but I will survive

I'm gonna keep reaching
I'm gonna keep climbing
I'm gonna keep trying

I'm gonna keep walking
Though it may seem far
I'm gonna keep preaching
When life gets too hard
Not gonna let you bring me down
I take the high road

I'm gonna get by on the high road
I'm gonna get by on the high road
I'm gonna get by on the high road
I'm gonna get by on the high road
I'm gonna get by on the high road
