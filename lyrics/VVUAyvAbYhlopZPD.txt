It starts as one festering feeling
The kind that cuts from the flesh down to the soul
No way to make amends for the time behind the door
Street lights feed lies straight to the mind of the wishful wanderer
How could he give up?
No second chances to say goodbye.

Wrapped in this cold, nostalgic energy from the cries of the ones who are
Buried
Ascend beyond.

Life is ruthless and shot full of pain.
It lifts you up, leaves you out in the rain,
And it hurts just to know that you're not coming back again.
I will miss you my friend
Memories like a slug to the brain
Paint the walls with a love that will stain the darkest of nights
You left to join the stars and I cannot shake this off my chest.

In death we grieve until all have transcended from this realm
In time we will meet again.
Suddenly I can feel the connection between dimension ties
Open gut on the floor. Trembling down to the core.
What is this?

It's been a long ride without you
I'm lost inside my own world.
There's not a single day where I've feigned the acceptance,
But it's a somber stroll down this road that we call life.

The silence still is crawling out of my sedated sight.
How can I be free?

Wrapped in this cold, nostalgic energy from the cries of the ones who are
Buried
Ascend beyond.

Life is ruthless and shot full of pain.
It lifts you up, leaves you out in the rain,
And it hurts just to know that you're not coming back again.
I will miss you my friend
Memories like a slug to the brain
Paint the walls with a love that will stain the darkest of nights
Left to journey alone, but I can find my way back home.
