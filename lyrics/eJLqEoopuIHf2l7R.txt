Tell me, are you free?
Tell me, are you free?
In thought or word or deed
Tell me, are you free?

While the gallows stand, bullets lance the bravest lungs
We fold our hands and hold our tongues

Tell me, are you free?
When the fear falls on you
Tell me, are you free?
When the fear falls on you

Tell me, are you free?
Tell me, are you free?
In thought or word or deed
Tell me, are you free?

While the gallows stand, bullets lance the bravest lungs
Will I fold my hands or hold my tongue?
Or let the flames lick at my feet
And breathe in fire and know I'm free
Flames will rise and devour me
To breathe in fire, and know I'm free

Ohh...
