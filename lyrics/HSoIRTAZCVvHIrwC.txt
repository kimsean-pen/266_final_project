First floor, room 16
Smells like danger, even better
Set your goals, bless our souls
I'm in trouble, but it feels like heaven

You were like one of those guys
The kind with the wandering eyes
But I said, "Hey, what the hell?"
Once in my life I'll take a ride on the wild side

You were so full of yourself
But damn, were you cute as well
You liked my legs, I liked your moves
Anyone could tell not hard to deny that

Did it again, now I got it all wrong
But it felt so right, I can't believe it
And all the mistakes that went on for too long
Wish there was a way I could delete them

Second night in a row
Back in trouble, I don't get it
Gotta keep it down 'cause the lobby called
But we ignore them 'cause it's getting better

When it comes to men, it's known
That I end up choosing wrong
'Cause I always trip and fall
On the same old rock and repeat and go back

How blind a girl can be
To miss you hide your ring?
Lied about everything, I'm so naive
And I should have known that

Did it again, now I got it all wrong
But it felt so right, I can't believe it
And all the mistakes that went on for too long
Wish there was a way I could delete them

It may seem to you that I am in a place
Where I'm losing the direction of my life
But I'm sure that this is nothing but a phase
Right back at ya 'cause I'll survive

It may seem to you that I am in a place
Where I'm losing the direction of my life
But I'm sure that this is nothing but a phase
Right back at ya 'cause I'll survive

Did it again, now I got it all wrong
But it felt so right, I can't believe it
And all the mistakes that went on for too long
Wish there was a way I could delete them

Did it again, now I got it all wrong
