I must have read a thousand faces.
I must have robbed them of their cause.
Sickened thirst, sickened thirst.
Keeps it together.
Soft white glow in the cranium.
A bullseye made sedated.

Beware!

I must have read a thousand faces.
And all these voices won't give up.
Sickened thirst, sickened thirst.
Glues it together.
A catatonic leisure.
At 1000 miles per hour.

Beware!

So who's in charge in here?
Barking out loud so clear.
Because I'd really like to meet him.

So who's in charge in here?
In the rear view of this mirror.
Because I'd really like to meet him.

So who's in charge in here?
Barking out loud and clear.
Because I'd really like to meet him.

Uproar east, strike west.
(Sheng Tung, Che Hsi)
Have you ever tasted skin?
Sink your, sink your teeth in it.
Have you ever tasted skin?
Sink your teeth into.
Have you ever?
Beware!
