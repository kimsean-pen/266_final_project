Failed attempts have turned us into one pathetic twisted wreck
All is eerie, you're standing near me
I feel you breathing down my neck

You don't need to be so shallow
Turn your head prepare to follow

Deep incison operation
The tourtured one becoming two
Involuntary, solitary
Its nice to have a point of view

Dependency
Separate we never will be
Attached at the hip to me
Separate we never will be
When there's no privacy
Separate we'll never be seen
Attached at the hip to me
(attached at the hip to me, attached at the hip to me)
A part of my anatomy

You don't need to be so shallow
Turn your head prepare to follow

Have you ever seen another lying in a pool of blood?

Separate we never will be
Attached at the hip to me
Separate we never will be
When there's no privacy
Separate we'll never be seen
Attached at the hip to me
(attached at the hip to me, attached at the hip to me)
A part of my anatomy

You don't need to be so shallow
