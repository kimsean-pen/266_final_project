I left the sign with a candle
in the street light that shone there oh
where through the night the people danced
in linen and smoke
I still remember, the song in my head
each palm in time, every face in that light
as their mouths bellowed

now they tell me she's just vanished
some other place by the sea
but to me she was banished
by herself, not by me
no I still remember the streelights of old
now dull in the night
and the dancers gone quiet
but the sea still bellows

see the island on fire
and the towers alight
And built in silos of sea
underneath every street
lily small covered cities born us
and ancient rubble of time stolen
where the walls tremor under the sky
covered day after day by the tide
could I save them if I tried?
if only I could

we shine our light across the ocean
the joy of this city has burned
we shine our light across the ocean
the fire on ships will return to shine our light
we shine our light
we shine our light
