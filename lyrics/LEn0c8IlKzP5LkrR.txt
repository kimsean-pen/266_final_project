Hey look here
With your holocaust lovers
And your old pullovers
And you faux first smiles again
Claiming you're a nonconformist
To rags, wheels, hide what you feel
What a fear
Falling into the ocean as it chops and cracks
Dance in eternal darkness
Your lungs are harnessed never to see day again
What a fear
Fallen on the bathroom floor
Tired of the rising shore
Bleeding on the bathroom floor
Laying on the bathroom floor
What a fear
I love it how you love me so
Then you come and take my culture and go
I'll never tell you what I know
I'll never tell you what I know
What a fear

Hey, mayday
You wanna save me?
You'll never be another lover
Another lover, another lover
You'll only be a poor relation
Poor relation, Poor relation
You'll never find your powerful roar
Powerful roar, powerful roar
You'll never find your powerful roar
Powerful roar, powerful roar
What a fear
