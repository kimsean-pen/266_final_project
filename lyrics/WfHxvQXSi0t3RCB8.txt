One mind divided into three, For every problem a personality
Each one trying to protect, for the crisis a person they'll select
With sorrow comes reassurance, With confusion there's ignorance

Deny who they are, A fantasy gone gone too far

Protecting the weak points of the mind
Defensive personalities
Violent one minute calm the next
Defensive Personalities

Passed down from generations, Years of pain and complication
Darkness was a punishment, Memories time cannot mend
Brutalised from the day of birth, To reality they can't return

Existing in a world of three lives inside of one

Protecting the weak points of the mind
Defensive personalities
Violent one minute calm the next
Defensive Personalities
