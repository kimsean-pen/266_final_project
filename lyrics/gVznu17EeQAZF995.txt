I can't do what you do
I'm just able to tear it down
Yeah

Stay in a cold minute of sleep
Feel the world
Right through the ether

Twisting names inside of me
Electric atmosphere to be
Must carry on one last time
Cannot end what has begun

In your eyes
In your eyes
You're alive

But in my eyes
In my eyes
You'r a lie

You can't do what I do
I'm just able to ruin you... yeah
Stay in the cold ways of winter
See myself right through the ether

Twisting names inside of me
Electric atmosphere to be
Must carry on one last time
Cannot end what has begun

In your eyes
In your eyes
You're alive

But in my eyes
In my eyes
You'r a lie

In my eyes
In my eyes
You're the lie

In my eyes
In my eyes
You're the lie

In my eyes
In my eyes
You're the lie

In my eyes
In my eyes
You're the lie

In my eyes
In my eyes
You're the lie

In my eyes
In my eyes
You're the lie

In my eyes
In my eyes
You're the lie

In my eyes
In my eyes
You're the lie.
