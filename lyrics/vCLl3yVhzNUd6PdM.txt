Oh,
Silly me, my dear, for thinking that you'd stay.
Gave you my heart and then you ran away.
Either I'm stupid, I'm foolish, and you're playin' me. But it seems
We were never really meant to be.
So I thought I would try something new.
I wanted to find out if I could live happy without you. And it turned out I wasn't living at all,
But I wouldn't have ever known
If you had just played along.

I was living a dream believing things that just ain't true.
Oh, I can't believe I ever believed in you.
You had me chasin' fool's gold.
I was chasin' fool's gold.
I was chasin' fool's gold.

Somewhere deep down inside I knew you wasn't right.
But breaking your spell was a plan I never devised.
I would've been here forever living for you,
But I would have been living forever as your fool.

I was living a dream believing things that just ain't true.
Oh, I can't believe I ever believed in you.
You had me chasin' fool's gold.
I was chasin' fool's gold.
I was chasin' fool's gold.

I bit into the apple.
I took the wooden nickel.
I was blinded to my core.
And I went into the wrong door,
And furthermore.

I was living a dream believing things that just ain't true.
Oh, I can't believe I ever believed in you.
You had me chasin' fool's gold.
I was chasin' fool's gold.
I was chasin' fool's gold.

I was living a dream believing things that just ain't true.
Oh, I can't believe I ever believed in you.
You had me chasin' fool's gold.
I was chasin' fool's gold.
I was chasin' fool's gold.

I was living a dream believing things that just ain't true.
Oh, I can't believe I ever believed in you.
You had me chasin' fool's gold.
I was chasin' fool's gold.
I was chasin' fool's gold.
