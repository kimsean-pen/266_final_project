You went looking for me, dear, down by the sea
You found some little silver fish but you didn't find me
I was hiding, dear
Hiding all away
I was hiding, dear
I was a-hiding all away

Then you went to the museum and you climbed the spiral stair
You searched for me all among the knowledgeable air
I was a-hidden, babe
I was a-hiding all away
I was a-hidden, dear
I was a-hiding all away

You entered the cathedral when you heard the solemn knell
I was not sitting with the gargoyles
I was not swinging from the bell
I was hiding, dear
I was a-hiding all away
I was a-hiding, dear
I was a-hiding all away

All right now

You asked an electrician if he'd seen me round his place
He touched you with his fingers
Sent sparks zapping out your face
I was hidden, dear
I was a-hiding all away
I was not there, dear
I was a-hiding all away

A-well, you went and asked the doctor to get some advice
Well, he shot you full of Pethidine and then he went and billed you twice
But I was a-hiding, dear
I was a-hiding all away
I was a-hiding, dear
A-hiding all away

You approached a high-court judge
You thought he'd be on the level
Well, he wrapped a rag around your face and he beat you with his gavel
I was a-hiding, babe
I was a-hiding all away
I was keeping hidden, dear
I was hiding all away

You looked to the local constabulary
They said, he's up to his same old tricks
They leered at you with their baby blues and rubbed jelly on their sticks
I had to get out of there, babe
I was a-hiding all away
You better get out of there, dear
Hiding all away

All right, yeah
All right, yeah

You searched through all my poets from Sappho through to Auden
I saw the book fall from your hands as you slowly died of boredom
I had been there, dear, but I was not there anymore
I had been there
Now I'm hiding all away

You walked into the hall of fame and approached my imitators
Some were stuffing their faces with the caviar
Some were eating cold potatoes
But I was a-hiding, dear
I was a-hiding all away
I was hiding, dear
I was a-hiding all away

Well, you asked a famous cook if he'd seen me
He opened his oven wide
Well, he basted you with butter, babe, and he made you crawl inside
But I was not in there, dear
I was a-hiding all away
I was not in there, dear
I was a-hiding all away

You asked the butcher
Lifted up his cleaver
Stuck his fist up your dress
Said he must've been mad to leave you
But I had to get away, dear
I was a-hiding all away
I had to get away, dear
I was a-hidden all away

All right, yeah

Some of us we hide away
Some of us we don't
Some will live to love another day and some of us won't
But we all know there is a law and, that law, it is love
And we all know there is a war coming
Coming from above

There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
