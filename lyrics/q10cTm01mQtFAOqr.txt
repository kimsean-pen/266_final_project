Riddled by the trappings
Of words that makes the edges blur
Here on the outskirts
Of sincerity and pride
Stretched as far as words can reach
By the lure of higher meaning
There's something out there
Lost behind the power lines
It's all the same to me
It's all the same to me
Lost all faith in promises
And deadlines closing in
Tired of deciphering the wayward
Stands of truth

I don't care
'Cause I can't feel
I don't know
Anymore

Sure we've had a good run
With vowels, nouns and letters
But within its very nature
The ability to distort
There's nothing in the words I hear
That makes me want to take a stand
It has gone on for far too long
I chose to disengage
It's all the same to me
It's all the same to me
The ends of our conditioning
To swallow, take and like it
Rather keep me in the dark
Than look me in the eye

I don't care
'Cause I can't feel
I don't know
Anymore

It's all these same things pulling us down
To senses gone I cheer
It's all these same things making us blind
There's nothing here for me

Hear it coming
Heading for you now

I can't even stand the tone of arrogance
And denial on display
Here you are listless
Left for deaf
Thinking about what standards we set
In times of weary tongues
And ears that hear no end to it
Unwilling or unable
The difference left for times
Judgement
It's all the same to me
It's all the same to me
It passes on from wicked mouths
As victim takes on another role
New bold oppressor
Our teacher's product
Now stands tall

I don't care
'Cause I can't feel
I don't know
Anymore

It's all these same things pulling us down
To senses gone I cheer
It's all these same things making us blind
There's nothing here for me

Hear it coming
Heading for you now
Hear
