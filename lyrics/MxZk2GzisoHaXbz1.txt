Day and night
Your love is like a Quaalude
Keep me locked in tight, tight, tight
I'm sinking in your bedroom

I can't help this
Distance between us is bringing us closer
I know I'm fighting this

Sun on my hands and the wind in my hair
Never be back, I don't care
I wanna go driving
Just wanna go driving
I had a dream far away, far away
Walking, I need to go find it
I wanna go driving
Just wanna go driving

Night and day
I'm speeding on the highway
Skyline, won't nothing stand in my way

I can't help this feeling
I'm losing myself to the same shit
I know I'll finally miss it

Sun on my hands and the wind in my hair
Never be back, I don't care
I wanna go driving
Just wanna go driving
I had a dream far away, far away
Walking, I need to go find it
I wanna go driving
Just wanna go driving

(Wanna go driving, wanna go)
(Wanna go driving, wanna go)
(Wanna go driving, oh)
(Wanna go driving, oh)

When you're everywhere I go go
I'm diving in my own road
I'm letting down my window driving
When you're everywhere I go go
I'm letting down my window driving
I'm revving on my road, driving

With the sun on my hands and the wind in my hair
Never be back, I don't care
I wanna go driving
Just wanna go driving
I had a dream far away, far away
Walking, I need to go find it
I wanna go driving
Just wanna go driving
