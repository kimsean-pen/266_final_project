What's inside?
Feeling sore
You're uncomfortable
For what it's worth

Grief inside
Fake you out
It's uncomfortable
Sometimes

We said we would ride
We said we would take them out to sea
I wouldn't be
Within arm's length
Within arm's length
Within arm's length
Within arm's length

Tried to stay keen
But they killed our forces
Hold up your hands
But their deals they can't fills us
We're balancing
A call to arms

I was the reason
Hold up the visa
They came but didn't know us
We're balancing
A call to arms

They can take our insides
They can take our insides
They can take our insides
They can take our insides
