First there's walking
There's a skeptical protector
And laughter in the station
From a real forgery

With two minutes of the last song
You know there's nothin' like the past
Gonna set you up for nothin'
Just to see how long you last

I'm reveling with you, I'm suspended in the air
It's not fair, give it back
Never would've thought there's no air involved
New familiar

Walk closer, you can see it
Give up the open space
Sacrifice your days
With the news in the sun

Reduced to a pile
And you're leaving again
Always a different world
From where it all began

I'm reveling with you, I'm suspended in the air
It's not fair, give it back
Never would've thought there's no air involved
New familiar

I'm reveling with you, I'm suspended in the air
It's not fair, give it back
Never would've thought there's no air involved
New familiar, new familiar
