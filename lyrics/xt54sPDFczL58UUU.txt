Unafraid, unafraid of the will to draw near
Unafraid of the will to draw near

Precious sol
I think it sweet of you

Intergalactic
Are you an over compensator

Crusade to expand calendric systems
For a universe of round worlds
An object from afar
To expand

Faint object camera
Drawing near, drawing near
Faint object camera
Drawing near, drawing near, drawing near

Keep unafraid of the will to draw near you
Crusade to expand calendric systems
For a universe of round worlds
An object from afar
To expand

Crusade to expand calendric systems
For a universe of round worlds
An object from afar
