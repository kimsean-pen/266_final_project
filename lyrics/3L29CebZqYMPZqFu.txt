Everything becomes so defined
That in the end there's no definition
They do not mean a thing
They do not tell a story

We communicate more and more
In more defined ways than ever before
But no one was got anything to say
It's all very poor it's all just a bore

Someone has got to make the difference
Between the seeming and the meaning

The seeming over runs the meaning
