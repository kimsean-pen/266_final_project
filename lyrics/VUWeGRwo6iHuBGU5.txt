Buzilla baby
Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe we'll get over
Try and love might come your way
Here I am, on a cloud
If you want me take the chance try love out loud
As I drift through the sky
Shooting cupid's arrow you just might try
So don't miss baby, take your time
You only got one chance, yes
Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe we'll get over
Touch a four leaf clover
Love my getcha over
Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe we'll get over
Try and love might come your way
Like the way I am free
Going places, being things I wanna be
To settle down, is oh so hard
But I will grant you that one chance
So pick the right card
And don't miss it, take your time
You only got one chance, do wee ooh wee ooh
Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe we'll get over
Touch a four leaf clover
Love might getcha over
Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe we'll get over
Try and love might come your way
Free as a bird, yeah, yeah
To catch me is to catch a leprechaun
Hold on to your rabbit's foot
I just might be yours forever
Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe we'll get over
Touch a four leaf clover
Love might get you over
Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe we'll get over
Try and love might come your way
Catch a four leaf clover
(Touch a four leaf clover)
Touch a four leaf clover
Try and love might come your way
Touch a four leaf clover
(Touch a four leaf clover)
Try and love might come your way
Touch a four leaf clover

Try and love might come your way (Maybe you'll get over)
