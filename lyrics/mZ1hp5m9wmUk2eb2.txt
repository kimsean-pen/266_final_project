Little boy I know you want something from me
Yes I might be blind but I am free
Don't you try and take that away from me
Little girl I know you think that I'm a mystery
Yes you might be blind but you are free
Don't you cry and wish that away from me
It's God you need x2
We're young
We're young and lost and need something to put our hopes up
Need something to protect us.
It's God you need x2
Sit down and worship me x3
Forgive me x4
Sit down and worship me
Devote your life to peace
Sit down and worship me
Devote your life to peace, and breathe
