I'm coming up only to hold you under
I'm coming up only to show you wrong
And to know you is hard, we wonder
To know you all wrong, we warn

Ooooohh, oooohh
Ooooohhhoohhhhooh
Really too late to call, so we wait for
Morning to wake you, it's all we got

To know me as hardly golden
Is to know me all wrong, they warn

At every occasion, I'll be ready for the funeral
Every occasion once more
It's called the funeral
Every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral

At every occasion of one-billion day funeral
I'm coming up only to you show you down for
I'm coming up only to you show you wrong

To the outside, the dead leaves lay on the lawn
Before they died, they had trees to hang their hope
Oooohhhohhhhhh
Oooooohooooooh
At every occasion, I'll be ready for the funeral
At every occasion once more, it's called the funeral
At every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral
Every occasion of one-billion day funeral
