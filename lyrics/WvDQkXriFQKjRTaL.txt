Outrun the fight
I used to hide
in quiet places

I'll rephrase my cry
For I would keep on wondering
the rest of my life

You're all moving too fast
My biggest fear is
that we'll never ever last

I know, it's not that easy
Let's hit the brakes

Don't take no time
Unless there's a crime
to be committed

I guess we lost our faith
While we stand and wait
until nothing ever happen

I know, it's not that easy
Let's hit the brakes
