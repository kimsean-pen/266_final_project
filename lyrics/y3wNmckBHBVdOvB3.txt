Don't wanna lose you
Don't wanna lose
Don't wanna lose you
Don't wanna lose
I never knew you
I never knew
I never knew you
I never knew

You bought ...to every shape
To cross the deeper on every faith

Don't wanna lose you
Don't wanna lose
Don't wanna lose you
Don't wanna lose

I get impressed with everyword
The more you ask me the more I say
For the first time I never hide
I never dream for another man

Don't wanna lose you
Don't wanna lose
Don't wanna lose you
Don't wanna lose

My baby grieved
My face grieved without an emotion

In the darkness comes another
Another, another
Ordered by the ... the other the other

Don't wanna lose you
Don't wanna lose
Don't wanna lose you
Don't wanna lose
