I often stop and wonder
Why I appeal to men
How many times I blunder
In love and out again
They offer me devotion
I like it, I confess
When I reflect emotion
There's no need to guess

Falling in love again
Never wanted to
What am I to do?
I can't help it
Love's always been my game
Play it how I may
I was made that way
I can't help it

Men cluster to me
Like moths around a flame
And if their wings burn
I know, I'm not to blame
Falling in love again
Never wanted to
What am I to do?
I can't help it

Falling in love again
Never wanted to
What am I to do?
I can't help it
Love's always been my game
Play it how I may
I was made that way
I can't help it

Men cluster to me
Like moths around a flame
And if their wings burn
I know, I'm not to blame
Falling in love again
Never wanted to
What am I to do?
I can't help it
