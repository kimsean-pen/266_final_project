A fugitive from unreality
No sign of my god damned serenity
Lost in these barren lands
That have nothing I demand
Had to look for something new
And that day I found you
I found you, I found you

Living in a house of cards
Waiting for it all to fall
Hope for the best, plan for the worst
That's what my life is all about
Living in a house of cards
Waiting for it all to fall
Hope for the best, plan for the worst
That's what my life is all about

A qvasar from reality
With damaged mentality
I'll start editing your life
Replace the captain of your brain ship
Before we set sail for the fail

Living in a house of cards
Waiting for it all to fall
Hope for the best, plan for the worst
That's what my life is all about
Living in a house of cards
Waiting for it all to fall
Hope for the best, plan for the worst
That's what my life is all about

My destiny outruns me
And I can't find that key
To lock up everything that's bad inside of me
Don't you disagree
That your life would be
So much better without me, that isn't hard to see
Hard to see

Living in a house of cards
Waiting for it all to fall
Hope for the best, plan for the worst
That's what my life is all about
Living in a house of cards
Waiting for it all to fall
Hope for the best, plan for the worst
That's what my life is all about
Living in a house of cards
Waiting for it all to fall
Hope for the best, plan for the worst
That's what my life is all about
Living in a house of cards
Waiting for it all to fall
Hope for the best, plan for the worst
That's what my life is all about
