I walk along these streets until I Have you in my arms
Now that you're gone in my heart so wild and blue
And if I had the chance, I'd never let you go.
And doll if you haven't called back, I'm begging you please
True Blue, baby
True Blue, for you,
forever and now
No matter how far the distances
I just want you to know
that? my heart will always be true
true blue
for you
true blue
(incoherent)
true blue
true blue
true blue (for you babe)
