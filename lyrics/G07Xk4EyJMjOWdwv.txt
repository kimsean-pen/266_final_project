All that we've known's in harvest smoke.
This haze is our enemy.
Two facts enfold my heart and stone.
Nobody knows

When the winters a lie
And the forces fall
Will a silent you bring me home

When the winters alive
And the forces fall in me
I'll offset your tomb
And pull you from the sea

Porcelain tide nobody move.
These phantoms and wolfish dreams
All turn to white with leaded lungs
Can you see the light twisting.

When the winters a lie
And the forces fall
Will a silent you bring me home

When the winters alive
And the forces fall in me
I'll offset your tomb
And pull you from the sea

And you
Fall hard apart
The morn light drowns you
And you
Fall miles apart
What love will solve?

When the winters a lie
And the forces fall
Will a silent you bring me home

When the winters alive
And the forces fall in me
I'll offset your tomb
And pull you from the sea
