You found me deep beneath the water
This time it looked and felt so different
I'm begging to my loved ones, understand
I'm a useless man, the loving hand that you fell for
That you fell for

I took my fear back to Galileo
They told me son, just count your blessings
I wandered through those streets that you wouldn't mend
And I felt so low, the man I used to know
That you fell for, that you fell for

And oh, I wander
And oh, I live in fear
Cause when my shadow moves I shudder
For the fear inside my heart won't disappear, no dear

Cause I sold my spirit for your soul
I felt it running through my fingertips
I love you more than you will know
And I hope you understand
My strength lies in your hands

And oh, I wander
And oh, I live in fear
Cause when my shadow moves I shudder
For the fear inside my heart won't disappear, no dear

You took my only one, when I only wanted love
When I only wanted love
