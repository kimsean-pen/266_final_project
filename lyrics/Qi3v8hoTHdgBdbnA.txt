I live for the night, I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free falling
I live for the night, I live for the lights

I live for the high 'til I'm free falling (falling)

'Til I'm free falling (falling)
I live for the night

I am tryna holla
Got that ink up on my collar
Drinkin' 'til there's nada
Isn't whiskey, I don't bother
My bitches ain't no dimes, they be motherfuckin' dollars
So we stack our drinks up high, skyscrapin' 'til we taller
Ring ring, hit that up, show that universal love
If you bleed that red blood, dance until you get enough
Ring ring, hit that up, show that universal love
If you bleed that red blood, dance until you get enough

I'mma do what I want, whatever
I'mma rage 'til the dawn, all-nighter
Don't hold your breath, you know I'll sleep when I am dead

I live for the night, I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free falling
I live for the night, I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free falling (falling)

I live for the night
Free falling

I'm the Grim Reaper when I'm blaring out your speaker
Killin' off the weaker, welcome to the final feature
My head is in the clouds, you can say that I'm a dreamer
But I bang it super loud, turn that bitch into a screamer

I'mma do what I want, whatever
I'mma rage 'til the dawn, all-nighter
Don't hold your breath, you know I'll sleep when I am dead

I live for the night, I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free falling
I live for the night, I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free falling (falling)

I live for the night, I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free falling
I live for the night, I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free falling
I live for the night
