I like the feel of your name on my lips
And I like the sound of your sweet gentle kiss
And the way your fingers run through my hair
And how your sent lingers when you are not even there

And I like the way your eyes dance when you laugh
And how you enjoy your two hour baths
How you convince me to dance in the rain
With everybody watching like we were insane

But I love the way you love me
Oh baby, Strong and wild
Slow and easy
Heart and soul
So completely

I love the way you love me
I like the sound of ol' r'n'b
And you roll your eyes when I'm slightly off key

And I like the innocent way that you cry
from sappy old movies you seen a thousands of times
Ronan zingt niet mee
And I love the way you love me
Oh baby, Strong and wild

Slow and easy
Heart and soul
So completely
I love the way you love me
And I could list a million things (a million things)
I love to like about you (about you)
But they all come down to one reason (one reason)
I could never live without you
I love the way you love me
Oh baby, Strong and wild
(strong and wild)
Slow and easy
(slow and easy)
Heart and soul
(heart and soul)
So completely
I love the way you love me
I love (all) the way(s) that you love me
