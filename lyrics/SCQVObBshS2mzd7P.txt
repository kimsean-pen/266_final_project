Humans in the honest light
Love is a cold infection all right
Friday morning, one bad night
You have hurt the touch like a fever

Loosened my head from the beckoning light
Held in the palm trees of your eye
Til you let me down and leave her

You can't see me, can't see
You can't see me, can't see
You can't see me, can't see

Humans in the honest light
Love is a cold infection all right
Friday morning, one bad night
You have hurt the touch like a fever

You can't see me, can't see
You can't see me, can't see
You can't see me, can't see
