Just don't bother
Don't feed the animals
Don't let them run in circles
Don't be told
It just don't matter
It just don't matter
If you're more than ready run away
From dusk 'til dawn

Last night on the couch you're livid
It's a poor complain
It's the only thing you're sad and underweight
Whatever we're so close to serious
Whatever promise you made
I have no problem to say no

I'll never know
I'll never know
I'll never know you

Restrained
Reach out for me
I'll never know if you don't

It's just another
It's just another
Complicated case to settle
Down the road
Whatever we're too close to serious
Whatever promise you made
From dusk 'til dawn

Don't swear that it is your fault
You're sophisticated
I saw the chandelier
I'm foreign and under stress
Whatever we're too close to serious
Whatever comments you make
I hear the rattle to say no

I'll never know
I'll never know
I'll never know you

Restrained
Reach out for me
I'll never know if you don't
