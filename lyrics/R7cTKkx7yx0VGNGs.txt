Uno, dos, tres
It's been a really, really messed up week
Seven days of torture, seven days of bitter
And my girlfriend went and cheated on me
She's a California dime, but it's time for me to quit her

La la la, whatever
La la la, it doesn't matter
La la la, oh well
La la la

We're going at it tonight, tonight
There's a party on the rooftop, top of the world
Tonight, tonight
And we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it
But watch how good I'll fake it
It's alright, alright
Tonight, tonight

I woke up with a strange tattoo
Not sure how I got it, not a dollar in my pocket
And it kinda looks just like you
Mixed with Zach Galifianakis (huh)

La la la, whatever
La la la, it doesn't matter
La la la, oh well
La la la

We're going at it tonight, tonight
There's a party on the rooftop, top of the world
Tonight, tonight
And we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it
But watch how good I'll fake it
It's alright, alright
Tonight, tonight

You got me singing like
Wo-o-oh, come on
O-o-oh, it doesn't matter
Wo-o-oh, everybody now
O-o-oh (oow!)

Just don't stop, let's keep the beat pumping
Keep the beat up, let's drop the beat down
It's my party, dance if I want to
We can get crazy, let it all out

Just don't stop, let's keep the beat pumping
Keep the beat up, let's drop the beat down
It's my party, dance if I want to
We can get crazy, let it all out it's...

You and me, and we're runnin' this town and
It's me and you, and we're shakin' the ground and
Ain't nobody gonna tell us to go
'Cause this is our show, everybody

Wo-o-oh, come on
O-o-oh, all you animals
Wo-o-oh, let me hear you now
O-o-oh

Tonight, tonight
There's a party on the rooftop, top of the world
Tonight, tonight
And we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it
But watch how good I'll fake it
It's alright, alright
Tonight, tonight
It's alright, alright
Tonight, tonight
Yeah, it's alright, alright
Tonight, tonight

Just singing like
Wo-o-oh, come on
O-o-oh, all you party people
Wo-o-oh, all you singletons
O-o-oh, even the white kids
Just don't stop, let's keep the beat pumping
Keep the beat up, let's drop the beat down
It's my party, dance if I want to
We can get crazy, let it all out
Just don't stop, let's keep the beat pumping
Keep the beat up, let's drop the beat down
It's my party, dance if I want to
We can get crazy, let it all out it's...
