I watch my heart trap easy to water
I clap my hands
You were taking a bow

I sat and watched you leaving for an hour
I still can' believe it now

It could have been the other way
I could have been the one to make you stay
I thought it would be you and I

Could I have the last supply?
Could I hit the bullseye?
Could I hit the bullseye?

I saw my brother standing
At the altar
I thought at you as they were taking their vows

I sat and watched this picture for an hour
I still believe somehow

I could give what you wanted
You never told me what you needed
I could give what you wanted
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you need

It could have been the other way
I could have been the one to make you stay
I wish I was the other guy
I wish I was the one to make you cry

Could I have the last supply?
Could I hit the bullseye?
Could I hit the bullseye?
