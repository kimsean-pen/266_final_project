Hey-oh
Hell won't give me-

Mercy, mercy, knock down my door
Told me you were here to replace my scorn
Not so fast with your stick back face
I dare you to run when they get there

Oh, oh
Come and get it, come and get it

Feel my wicked ways running through my veins
Take a bitter taste of a shallow grave
I watched you burn, burn, burn
Till the many breaks, and you wash away
Gonna turn, turn, turn
To a ghost of awe, that you left on me

Dirty mercy, excuses to please
All your hollow words will get me on my knees
Head still hurts from the poison you spit
Even life's stink gotta do your bit

Feel my wicked ways running through my veins
Take a bitter taste of a shallow grave
I watched you burn, burn, burn
Till the many breaks, and you wash away
Gonna turn, turn, turn
To a ghost of awe, that you left on me

I take and take and take until I choke
Steal my money then I'm your goal
You take and take until I choke
Steal my money then I'm your goal
You take and take until I choke
Steal my money then I'm your-

Feel my wicked ways running through my veins
Take a bitter taste of a shallow grave
I watched you burn, burn, burn
Till the many breaks, and you wash away
Gonna turn, turn, turn
To a ghost of awe, that you left on me
