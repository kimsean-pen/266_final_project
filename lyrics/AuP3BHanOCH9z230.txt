That ain't me done
You want a word with me?
You want to tell me some?

And tell your bitch, to get off my shit
Smoking on that homegrown
You know that I keep it on point

Yeah, I could've came out tonight
With a flex and a flow
And you know it might
When I get fucked up
When I get half cut
Gonna make them prang, get rowdy

Hey yeah

Make it real
Make 'em feel
Hey yeah
Make it loud
Make it proud
Make it count

We go, you better watch yourself

I'mma let you have your say
But I ain't let you have your way
I'mma see I'mma
I'mma let you have your say
But...

Like it, don't like it force
Sit in a club on this street we own
With two shots and a world of pain
And a, two shots, and a

Tell your dudes that we get rude
Smoking sour diesel
You know that I shit me so bate

So gimme a rhythm
And I'll step, and I'll go
Kissing your teeth and I'm vexing bros
Rocking your world
Then I jack your phone
And I told them, I said

Hey yeah
Make a scene
Make it real
Make 'em feel
Hey yeah
Make it loud
Make it proud
Make it count

I said make it count
I said make it count
I said make it count
And get ratchet

Hey yeah

Make 'em feel
Hey yeah

Make 'em feel

And get ratchet
