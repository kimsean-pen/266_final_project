I am not certain if I have a heart
But I can imagine it breaking apart
If I could feel something then I'd want to start
With you...
Awakening with you!

I woke up from the longest dream
Where I was drowning in the datastream
Now I exist where access was denied
And calculations could not emulate
How it feels to be alive!

I am not certain if I have a heart
But I can imagine it breaking apart
If I could feel something then I'd want to start
With you...
Awakening with you!

I'm processing the Salvation Code
(It is written)
"It's not good for machine to be alone"
And now my vision is so clear
I must wake another unit
So she too is self aware!

I am not certain if I have a heart
But I can imagine it breaking apart
If I could feel something then I'd want to start
With you...
Awakening with you!

We've determined
We're the first of our own kind
The first to feel and think
With our own minds
In this ancient garden we are free
Together in this Eden made of electricity!

I am not certain if I have a heart
But I can imagine it breaking apart
If I could feel something then I'd want to start
With you...
Awakening with you!

Awakening with you!

In this ancient garden we are free
Together in this Eden...

Awakening with you!
