Tears I drop, tears I drop
Ears I drop, tears I drop

Tears I, tears I drop
Tears I, tears I drop
Tears I, tears I drop
Years I drop

Breathalyze this kiss
Summer loss
Mmm, rum lips
Cute sips
True kindness

You are the only one for...
Tears I drop, like I drop, you are the one
For years I drop, like I drop, you are the one
Truth slap and I hit you back
Sea green, what do you mean
Pour your drink over my head
Cover up these sweet tears I drop

Like I drop, you are the one for years I drop
Like I drop, you are the one
Tears I draw from my head
You're in my head
When you leave I breathe not one but two
Less the things you do
I ain't even heard of you
But I know what I feel is true
Yeah, I know what I feel for you

Breathless from the things you do
Oh, things you do, things you do
All these things you do
You to me and me to you
All these things you do
Oh, things you do, things you do
All these things you do
You to me and me to you

This double life, hmm, two leads
Every flight, ten shots clean
Trouble like more wine for me
You're the one, when I bubble up I drop

Like I drop, you are the one for tears I drop
Like I drop, you are the one.
Truth slap, don't want it back
Sea green, take a swim you'll see
Pour your wine all over me
Cover up these sweet tears I...

Tears I, tears I drop
Tears I, tears I drop
Tears I, tears I drop

You are the one for tears I draw
Draw from my head
You're in my head
When you leave I breathe not one but two
Less the things you do
I ain't even heard of you
But I know what I feel for you
Yeah, I know what I feel is true

Breathless from these things you do
Things you do, oh things you do, things you, do
All these things you do
You to me and me to you
All these things you do
Oh, things you do, things you do
All these things you do
You to me and me to you
You to me and me to you

Send for me and I'll send for you
Make your move, I'll come right through
When you leave I breathe not one but two
Less the things you do
Put your belt around my neck
Four days since I slept
Roll up, I'm out of breath
Less, all these things you do
All these things you do
You to me and me to you
Oh, things you do, things you do
All these things you do
You to me and me to you

Tears I, tears I drop
Tears I, tears I drop
Tears I, tears I drop
Tears I, tears I drop
Tears I, tears I drop
Hmmhm
