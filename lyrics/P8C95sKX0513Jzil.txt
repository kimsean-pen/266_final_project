Never thought it would happen again
Another smooth talker disguised as a friend
You sit among us but you cease to exist
Soaking it all in to spew from your lips
There's always one of you in the corner
There's always one of you at the door
We stomp and stomp and kick and crush
There's always one of you on the floor

Spy

You don't have anyone's back
You aren't on anyone's side
The ends will never justify
The goods that have to die
