Mortal once again
Making out, watch me pretend
And you whisper words forbidden
To see if I've been listening
Well now I'm listening

We won't both get our way
If we do, it won't be tonight anyway
So I hold you by the jaw
And kiss you to be sure
With so much more then before

It took a wild heart to tame mine
And it took a wild heart to charm
Now a wild heart has gone and floored me
With this ever lasting glance
But this ever lasting glance

I wouldn't have you any other way
Who wants love that makes sense anyway

I guess I asked for the truth
I guess I asked for it, brutal and unchained
But tonight it sounds improvised
Whatever has you so inspired
While I know you're inspired

And no one is better armed
To tear me down with a sleight of the tongue
And I could do the same
And see how long you can keep face
Let's see who's keeping face

But it took a wild heart to tame mine
And it took a wild heart to chance
Now a wild heart has gone and floored me
With this ever lasting glance
But this ever lasting glance

I wouldn't have it any other way
Who wants love that makes sense anyway

I wouldn't have you any other way
I don't want a love that makes sense anyway

But it took a wild heart to tame mine
And it took a wild heart to chance
Now a wildheart has gone and floored me
With this ever lasting glance
With her ever lasting glance
