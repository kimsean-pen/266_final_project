Too shy baby baby
I'm right at your boarder
Hearts out masquerading
Why can't I come over I wonder what you do
I'm looking at your perfect outlines
I wanna get with you
And get beyond your perfect outlines
Another one drops to pressure
Another dance in the dark Another love undercover
Outlines of the heart
Another one drops to pressure
Another dance in the dark
Another love undercover
Outlines of the heart
Outlines
Outlines
Outlines
Outlines
Another one drops to pressure
Another dance in the dark
Another love undercover
Outlines of the heart
Another one drops to pressure
Another dance in the dark
Another love undercover
Outlines of the heart
Another one drops to pressure
Another love undercover
It takes all your courage
To come any closer
Rise up silhouetting
Shoulder to shoulder
I wonder who are you
I'm looking at your perfect outlines
I wanna get with you
And get beyond your perfect outlines
Another one drops to pressure
Another dance in the dark
Another love undercover
Outlines of the heart
Another one drops to pressure
Another dance in the dark
Another love undercover
Outlines of the heart
Outlines
Outlines
Outlines
Outlines
Another one drops to pressure
Another dance in the dark
Another love undercover
Outlines of the heart
Another one drops to pressure
Another dance in the dark
Another love undercover
Outlines of the heart
Another one drops to pressure
Another love undercover
Another one drops to pressure
