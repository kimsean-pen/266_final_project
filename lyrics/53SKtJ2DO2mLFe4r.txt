I'm out
When she loved me
I'm still seeing honey sweet
She shouts
Don't you leave me
Don't you leave this incomplete

I wanna know if this road belongs
To my eyes and only mine
Then I go back
and show my love
A heart attack I'm told, I should have known
No more nights alone
So cold
Lets go back to sweet
Honey sweet

I'm out
I heard a heavy creek
Behind my window
honey sweet
There's no doubt
You still love me
You'd still love this incomplete

I wanna know if this road belongs
To my eyes and only mine
Then I go back
and show my love
A heart attack I'm told, I should have known
No more nights alone
So cold
Lets go back to sweet
Honey sweet

Tear drops stains dries in thunder,
Our two pain
Change my number
I've seen you two about it
Talk about rebounding

I go back
and show my love
A heart attack I'm told, I should have known
No more nights alone
So cold
Lets go back to sweet

I go back
and show my love
A heart attack I'm told, I should have known
No more nights alone
So cold
Lets go back to sweet

Honey sweet
Honey sweet
Honey sweet
Honey sweet
Honey sweet
