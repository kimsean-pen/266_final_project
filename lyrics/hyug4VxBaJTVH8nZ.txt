Broken limbs bound to funeral pyres, torches lit, skyward
Ceremonious light for the damned, the lord is now upon you
In chains they dread the coming day, cast away from home
Condemned with sins too great to atone, look now upon the light
Blood-red hatred and fear light the night
Broken limbs bound to funeral pyres, torches lit, skyward
Ceremonious light for the damned, the lord is now upon you
United in fear they cast them to the dark, the unknown beyond ourselves
You are a warning to those who dare to transgress against their will
As fear feeds greed they contemplate the worth of life
A price paid in blood and fire to those with eyes to see them burn
Boundless scornful hatred are the fires that blaze a storm of smoke
Breathe me in and sing of justice as the innocents unfurl
I can't escape the wrath of deities, I beheld his flames to watch my world burn
Detestable, scorned, unbowed
Unworthy of your perishing world
I cannot live for want of dying
I cannot see for embers block my view
"My god is in your head
His fire is in your blood
This world is in his hands
You are beyond repent"
Look now upon your final season, the grey canvas of snow and frost
Look now upon the light, your vessel into the dark
Dare I seek guidance as I pass through
Dare I seek reprieve, dare I live
And the stars will fall, burned grey, floating down
Distant lights begin to fade from view
The incense of flesh is the scent of the church
