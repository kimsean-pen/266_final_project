Sleep
Like pillow
No one there
Where
She won't care
Anywhere

Soft
As pillow
Touch her there
Where
She won't dare
Somewhere

Sweet
And mellow
Softer there
Feel
Like you grew
Stronger there

Speak
Your trouble
She's not square
Soft
Like her silk
Everywhere

Sleep
As pillow
Comfort there
Where
She won't dare
Anywhere

Look
In the mirror
She's not there
Where
She won't care
Somewhere
