I can't make you say my name
When all you know is hers
You're falling for that someone else, I know
I can't make you feel this way
My heart is sinking in
There's no way to change it for you

My feelings go forever
You're exactly what I needed
Even when we're breaking
I'll be loving you!
I'll be loving you!
Here we go again now
Running 'round in circles
I don't care my heart aches
'Cause I'll be loving you
I'll be loving you!

I thought you would feel the same
Your touch it said it all
But clearly you were quick to flaw, now I know
I thought you would make it right
And slowly start to mend
This broken love affair of ours, but no

My feelings go forever
You're exactly what I needed
Even when we're breaking
I'll be loving you!
I'll be loving you!
Here we go again now
Running 'round in circles
I don't care my heart aches
'Cause I'll be loving you
I'll be loving you!

You stopped my heart
Made it an echo of time gone by
Pulling the strings again
You make me cry
You make me scream
But love is holding me to you

My feelings go forever
You're exactly what I needed
Even when we're breaking
I'll be loving you!
I'll be loving you!

Here we go again now
Running 'round in circles
I don't care my heart aches
'Cause I'll be loving you
I'll be loving you!
