I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
And right now I'm on the inside
Lookin' out, 'cause

I standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning
Today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake
And let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out
With the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale
Can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor
The gas pedal, and hit the corner fast
The more asserted, never looking back
May hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve
As you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to, to avert a disaster
Lucky, no permanent damage
'Cause they hurt you so bad
It's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket
But you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past
Standing at inferno and chant

I standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

So familiarize
With what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart
And steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died
Because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means
You will survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you
From leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good
That you're willing
To forgive them even after
All that shit you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building
And the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in
But your fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof
You're just chillin' and you look down
'Cause you're so over them you could
Put the heel of your foot through the ceiling

As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds? Wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's gone down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt
In your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream

I standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn rising
A phoenix from the flames
Flame of love, we're going to fight the word, fight
Now it feels with these wings that I will fly

I standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light:
