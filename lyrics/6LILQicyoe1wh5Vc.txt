Here I am, still like stones
Trying to get me moving on
Man, I bleed for new age need
To make me whole inside

Let it pass, let it pass
Break away my brother
Let it pass, let it pass
You're out of sight

Here I am, running hot
A silver-stacking money hog
Need the key to man in me
To make the best of the night

Let it pass, let it pass
Break away my brother
Let it pass, let it pass
Break away my sister
Let it pass, let it pass
You pass it on to others
Let it pass, let it pass
Don't make a run for the night

Let it pass, let it pass
Break away my brother
Let it pass, let it pass
Before you pass it on to others
Let it pass, let it pass
Break away my sister
Let it pass, let it pass
Before you lose all sight
