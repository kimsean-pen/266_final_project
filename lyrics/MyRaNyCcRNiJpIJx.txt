Even now in heaven
There were angels carrying savage weapons

An eye for an eye...(for an eye...)
A tooth for a tooth...(for a tooth...)

Run, run, run,
But you sure can't hide...(hide... hide)

An eye for an eye...(for an eye...)
A tooth for a tooth...(for a tooth...)

Run, run, run,
But you sure can't hide...(hide... hide)

Does our ruin benefit to earth?
Does it help the grass to grow? The sun to shine?
Is this darkness in you too?
Have you'd passed through this night?

Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide...(hide, hide...)

Where you're going you're not coming back from

Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide...(hide, hide...)

An eye for an eye...(for an eye...)
A tooth for a tooth...(for a tooth...)
Run, run, run,
But you sure can't hide...(hide... hide)

An eye for an eye...(for an eye...)
A tooth for a tooth...(for a tooth...)
Run, run, run,
But you sure can't hide...(hide... hide)

This great evil
Where's it come from?
Had still the end of the world?
Who's doing this?
Who's killing us?
Mocking us with the sight of what we might have known

Run, run, run...(run, run...)
Run, run, run...(run, run...)

An eye for an eye...(for an eye...)
A tooth for a tooth...(for a tooth...)
Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide...(hide... hide)

An eye for an eye...(for an eye...)
A tooth for a tooth...(for a tooth...)
Run, run, run,
But you sure can't hide...(hide... hide)

(An eye for an eye...)
Are you righteous?
(A tooth for a tooth...)
Kind?
(Run, run, run but you sure can't hide...)
Does your confidence lie in this?
(An eye for an eye...)
Are you loved by all?
(A tooth for a tooth...)
Do you imagine your suffrage will be enough?
(Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide...)
Because you loved goodness and truth?
An eye for an eye...
A tooth for a tooth...
Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide...
Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide...(hide hide...)

What are you to me?
