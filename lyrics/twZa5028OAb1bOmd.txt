She's watching the taxi driver
He pulls away
She's been
Locked up inside her apartment
A hundred days

She says
Yeah, he's still coming
Just a little bit late
He got stuck at the laundromat
Washing his cape

She's just
Watching the clouds roll by
And they spell her name
Like Lois Lane
And she smiles
Oh the way she smiles

She's talking to angels
Counting the stars
Making a wish on a passing car
She's dancing with strangers
Falling apart
Waiting for Superman to pick her up
In his arms
Yeah
In his arms
Yeah
And waiting for Superman

She's out on the corner
Trying to catch a glimpse
Nothing's making sense
She's been
Chasing an answer
A sign lost in the abyss
This Metropolis

She says
Yeah, he's still coming
Just a little bit late
He got stuck at the Five and Dime
Saving the day

She says
If life was a movie
Then it wouldn't end like this
Left without a kiss
Still she smiles
Oh the way she smiles
Yeah

She's talking to angels
She's counting the stars
Making a wish on a passing car
She's dancing with strangers
She's falling apart
Waiting for Superman to pick her up
In his arms
Yeah
In his arms
Yeah

She's waiting for Superman
To lift her up
And take her anywhere
Show her love
And climbing through the air
Save her now
Before it's too late tonight
Oh
Like a speeding light

And she smiles
She's talking to angels
She's counting the stars
Making a wish on a passing car
She's dancing with strangers
She's falling apart
Waiting for Superman to pick her up
In his arms
Yeah
In his arms
Yeah

She's waiting for Superman
To lift her up
And take her anywhere
Show her love
And climbing through the air
Save her now
Before it's too late tonight
She's waiting for Superman
