Turtle shell
Hide inside
Hide inside
Turtle shell

Panoply
Carapace
Sarcopha-ga-gus
You hide inside
(Oh you do)

It's 8 to 5
In the shutdown showroom
Label somethings
Dots to connect you

And you hide alot
Hide alot
Out of sight
Yeah you hide all night

Turtle shell
Hide inside
Carapace
Sacrophagus

Sacrophagus-fa-fa-fa
Sacrophagus-fa-fa-fa
Sacrophagus-fa-fa-fa

Turtle shell
Turtle shell

I can hear it with you
Day after day
And if I'm later be found
No one can know
In the truth we throw down
A hammer or two

On a turtle shell
Turtle shell
Turtle shell
Turtle shell

Turtle shell
