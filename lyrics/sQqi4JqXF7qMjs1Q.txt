Come and walk with me
We can go where peaceful waters flow

If loneliness surrounds you
And rain clouds always hang around you
And wakin up each day gets you down
And if the life that you're leading
Seems hollow, then maybe what you're needing
Is someone to turn your world around

Come take my hand and walk with me
Let me teach you how to smile Let me teach you how to smile
Ll show you skies where gentle breezes blow
Yeah, hey

And I'll take you where peaceful waters flow
If you let me I'll take you where peaceful waters flow
Mmm, hmm
We can go where peaceful waters flow

Now if the sunshine hurts your eyes, boy
Then it's time for you to realize, boy
Beyond this moment there's
A better day aching every step of your way

Come take my hand and walk with me awhile
Yeah, hey, hey
Let me teach you how to smile
And I'll show you skies where gentle breezes blow
Hey, yeah, hey, hey, hey

And I'll take you where peaceful waters flow
Hey, hey, if you trust me, I'll take you there where peaceful waters flow
Mmm... hmm...
We can go where peaceful waters flow
