This ain't no mother fucking playground
Bitch we don't play 'round
I was wearing wigs
Think I'm moving on to braids now
Everything I do
That, she wanna do it too now
Watching how I move
Tryna study all the tools
But you can't, you a lame
I can tell your pussy stank
Riding in that big body, when I hop out bet it dank
I'm on E little bitch, but I got a full tank
Fake on me little bitch, bet it make a bitch shake
First time I hit a mill I went and got some Gucci
Tell these bitches pull up and they playing hooky
If you ain't got bottles or bands bitch, don't book me
Run up on her, dark alley, in a black hoodie

B-b-b-bitch this the sugar trap turn your shit to puddin'
I'm always in the stu' bitch look at what I'm cookin'
I'm always this in some new shit so these hoes lookin'
And if you run up I bet you getting your shit tooken

I'm a poppin' ass bitch let me remind ya
Don't hide, I can always come and find ya
Ain't no bitch in me bitch, come proper
In an Audi going fast, you behind us
I'm a poppin' ass bitch let me remind ya
Don't hide, I can always come and find ya
Ain't no bitch in me bitch, come proper
In an Audi going fast, you behind us

Hey, everyday is lovely, everyday is sunny
I don't need your money bitch I got my own money
Should of seen the shit comin'
Seen that bitch start punchin'
Red Audi fruit punchin'
If we fight you know my niggas gonna jump in
I ain't scared bitch
Just a whole lot of gang shit
I'm a bear you a mother fucking reindeer
Where I stay you can't mother fucking stay there
Yuh, and I had to make that shit clear bitch

I said I'm in a red Audi, bitches fruit punchin'
On a beat I don't punch in

I'm a poppin' ass bitch let me remind ya
Don't hide, I can always come and find ya
Ain't no bitch in me bitch, come proper
In an Audi going fast, you behind us
