Stupid Kung Fu,
You know what I'm talking bout
Darling, darling
You know who the song's about
Slave on human, but you know who I really am
I say Truman, I know you gon' understand when
Tears keep falling, and the brighten got the best of me
New York's calling, meet me on the balcony
Say lead me, lead me
But you know what I really mean is
Keep me, keep me

When you're lonely and you need someone
Can you pour me just a glass of wine?
I'll come running, I'll drop everything
'Cause you know that you're my everything
When you're busy look I understand
I can have you like the way I drown
When you're lonely and you need someone
Just call me and you got someone

Don't you know you got somebody?
You'll always got somebody
Don't you know you got somebody in me?
Don't you know you got somebody?
You'll always got somebody
You got somebody in me!

Stupid Kung Fu,
You know where I'm coming from
When genius happens
There's no need for thinking on
Oh, God bless you
Still thankful for the view
Giving tender love and care
To those who need of you

Mexico, Aro, Frida y Diego,
Venga, cajate, sabes que te amo,
Leave me, leave me
But you know what I really mean
Is all I really need is you
When you're lonely and you need someone
Can you pour me just a glass of wine?
I'll come running, I'll drop everything
Cause you know that you're my everything
When you're busy look I understand
I can have you like the way I drown
When you're lonely and you need someone
You just call me and you got someone

Don't you know you got somebody?
You'll always got somebody
Don't you know you got somebody in me?
Don't you know you got somebody?
You'll always got somebody
You got somebody in me!

Don't you know you got somebody?
You'll always got somebody
Don't you know you got somebody in me?
Don't you know you got somebody?
You'll always got somebody
You got somebody in me!

Need somebody
Just call me and you got somebody
I'll drop everything ye-yeah
Just know you are my everything, ye-yeah
Na-na-yeah-yah
