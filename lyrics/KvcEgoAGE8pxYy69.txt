Deluxe Pain

If I told you, I might hurt myself (Yeah)
Couldn't tell me you're with someone else
But I hide my feelings

Girl, you make me
Feel like you been fucking everyone
So make me feel like
I make you feel good
Hey girl, you make me
Feel like you been fucking everyone
So make me feel like
I make you feel good

If I told you, you might hurt yourself
Should I hide my feelings?
If I told you I'm with someone else
Would I hurt your feelings?

Have they written you a love song? (No)
And have they treated you the right way? (No)
Will I ever be a number? (No)
You know
I know

Girl, you make me
Feel like you been fucking everyone
So make me feel like
I make you feel good
Hey girl, you make me
Feel like you been fucking everyone
So make me feel like
I make you feel good

Won't you make me feel like I make you feel good?
Won't you make me feel like I make you feel good?
Won't you make me feel like I make you fâ€”

Hey girl, you make me (Ooh)
You make me feel like
I make you feel good
Hey girl, you make me (Ooh)
You make me feel like
I make you feel good

Maybe I've written you a love song
'Cause I still need you
But it won't do no good
It isn't over when it's over
'Cause I still feel it
But it won't do no good
Could all the mediocrity
Just fall beneath and
Hollywood be ours?

Deluxe Pain

Never gonna figure it out (Yeah)
Never gonna figure it out (Ooh)
Never gonna figure it out (Yeah)
Never gonna figure it
Never gonna figure it
Never gonna figure it out (Yeah)
Never gonna figure it out (Ooh)
Never gonna figure it out (Yeah)
Never gonna figure it
Never gonna figure it out

The sins of our fathers
They start to add up
Undress to our curses
And forget-me-nots
The sins of our fathers
We'll never shake off
Undress to our curses
And forget-me-nots

And I hate you (Yeah)
But I love you all the same
And when I love you (Yeah)
I hate you all the same

Yeah

Welcome to Clarity Land
There will be no pleasure
And there will be no pain
W-welcome to Clarity Land
There will be no pleasure
And there will be no pain
Welcome to Cla-a-a-a
There will be no pleasure
And there will be no pain
No outrage
Just spinning teacup rides
