Hey!
Keep yourself safe, keep yourself safe she said
You broke your own heart but there's no need to lose your head
Hey!
Keep yourself sane, keep yourself sane he said
You've gotta give up, give up, give up the [?] to start again

And it feels like falling in, falling in love
Yeah it feels like falling in, falling in, falling in love
Cause [?] me tonight

Hey!
Keep the lights on, keep the lights on I said
I wanna see you, not the shadows beneath my bed
Hey!
Keep your hearts on, keep your hearts on they said
And don't you give up, give up, give up on running wild again

And it feels like falling in, falling in love
Yeah it feels like falling in, falling in, falling in love
And I've been running in, running in circles, in circles and wasting my, wasting my time
Yeah it feels like falling in, falling in, falling in love
'Cause [?] me tonight

Believe in, believe in love [?] dreaming
Believe in, believe in you 'cause you've broken the broken [?]
Believe in, believe in, believe in wild heart dreaming so tell me, tell me
That love can save me tonight

Hey!

And it feels like falling in, falling in love
And it feels like falling in, falling in, falling in love
And I've been running in, running in circles, in circles and wasting my, wasting my time
Yeah it feels like falling in, falling in, falling in love
'Cause [?] me tonight
'Cause [?] me tonight
'Cause [?] me tonight
And I'm falling in, falling in love
