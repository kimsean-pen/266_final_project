Pentagram
Relentless
Sign Of The Wolf (Pentagram)
A lone soul at night sits and bays at the moon
Though sometimes he's a man it's a Pentagram
Shogun blasts as he runs with the wind
But he just can't win it's the Pentagram

And now don't know how but it's happening to me
Got the love from above but it's happening to me

Black cloud hang and it just won't leave
though be tries to believe it's a Pentagram
Hard to conceive and he wants to perceive
but he's destined to grieve it's the Pentagram

Now don't know but it's happening to me
Got the love from above but it's happening to me

I can't turn back now

Stories unfold but they've all been told
When he sold his soul to the Pentagram
And to end his life though the silver is old
He will reach his goal by the Pentagram

And now don't know how but it's happening to me
Got the love from above but it's happening to me

Tell me one more time
It's alright
I can't turn back now
Cause it's the sign of the wolf
