sunday night
I've finally found
I've finally found
something to plug up this snorry mouth
since the day ['cause today?] she said to me (she saw slee smore)
this house moves more than you (show so snow)
so I tell her I sleep (so so still snore)
to keep from thinking it through (bless me)
now it's all I can do (shovel snow)
when you pull the sheets up overhead (sometimes so you know)
and she sends me out
to shove snow drifts in my bed (she sings sun she snore)
you'll reach for the door
arms feel weak
you'll make a mistake
and fly fly ahead
and it's all I can do
when you pull the sheets up overhead
and send me out
to shove snow drifts in my bed
today she said to me (sneer snore seer soar)
wanna get even with you more (sneer snore seer soar)
so I tell her she can (so show sea shore)
even more than before (full mouth sneer roar)
you'll reach for the door
and your arms feel weak
you'll make a mistake
and fly fly ahead
and it's all I can do
when you pull the sheets up overhead
and send me out
to shove snow drifts in my bed
I've finally found
I've finally found
something to plug up this snorry mouth
-?- see the sight
posts [puffs?] around my bed
you thrust up and down
arms around my head
pressures not mine
both in spirit and time
whisper wine
I've finally found
I've finally found
something to plug up this snorry mouth
so I bet she says to me (so show sneer snore)
need to see [to my side?] (seal the sown shear stone)
but by the time I made the bed (sneer snore sheer shore)
till you made up your mind (so so so so)
you'll reach for the door
arms feel weak
you'll make a mistake
and fly fly ahead
and it's all I can do
when you pull the sheets up overhead
and send me out
to shove snow drifts in my bed
I've finally found
I've finally found
something to plug up this snorry mouth
