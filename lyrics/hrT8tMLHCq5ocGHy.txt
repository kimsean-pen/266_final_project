Half life wastes before it goes
It's funny how your bee sting touch never leaves me whole
It's not enough to stay here almost trying
You keep your last laugh watch this dying
It's just your half time vertigo
And if you want an answer, I don't know

Chorus
If you had completed me
Don't think I'd be pleased with you
Don't think I'd compete with you
With half of me to take

Half life nothing I'd call home
It's lucky how these phantom limb bee stings never show
It's not enough to leave this falling kindly
You burn my star down twice as brightly
It's just your half light undertow
But if you need forgiveness, I don't know

Half light breaks with nothing wrong
Just a corner of my bed where you don't belong
It's kind of you to notice no-one's dying
You had your last laugh, almost crying
It's just your half life long to know
And if you need a reason, so it goes
