Plastic blue invitations in my room
I've been waiting here for you
Reservations made for two
Sunlight fading

Black tongues speak faster than the car can crash
You supply the rumours and I'll provide the wrath
Romance is breaking every heart in two
Casting shadows in the pale shade of blue

Plastic blue conversations in my room
Saving every tear for you
Trusting every word untrue
Twilight fading

Fate changes faster than the death of light
You provide the envy and I'll provide the spite
Reflections cutting every face in two
Casting shadows in the pale shade of blue
