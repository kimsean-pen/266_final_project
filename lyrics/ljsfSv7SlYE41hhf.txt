On the subject of you being gone forever
I still can't believe it I can't see it
I should just stop counting days

On the subject of the future
Wouldn't it be nice to leave it open ended
And pretend it could go either way

If I could have you back again
I'd think about it once or twice I guess
If I could have you back
I'd reconsider maybe I'd say yes
On the other hand it would be
Better to have a life
Without the constant indecision over
If I could have you back
If I could have you back

On the topic of the time we spent together
I can't say I never wonder
If you ever think about those days

If I could have you back again
I think about about one or twice I guess
If I could have you back
I'd reconsider maybe I'd say yes
On the other hand it would be
Better to have a life
Without the constant indecision over
If I could have you back
If I could have you back

It's game over
You've lost this round
And now I get to turn you down
Thanks for all the lessons learned
I'm takin' in what I have heard
Practice makes perfect

If I could have you back again
I'd think about it once or twice I guess
If I could have you back
I'd reconsider maybe I'd say yes
On the other hand it would be
Better to have a life
Without the constant indecision

If I could have you back again
I'd think about it once or twice I guess
If I could have you back
I'd reconsider maybe I'd say yes
On the other hand it would be
Better to have a life
Without the constant indecision over
If I could have you back
If I could have you back
