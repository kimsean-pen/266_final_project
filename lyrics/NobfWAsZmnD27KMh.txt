If I show you, get to know you
If I hold you just for today
I'm not gonna wanna let go
I'm not gonna wanna go home
Tell me you feel the same

'Cause I'm 4 real, are you 4 real?
I can't help myself, it's the way I feel
When you look me in the eyes, like you did last night
I can't stand to hear you say goodbye

Well, it feels so right 'cause it feels so right
Just to have you standing by my side
So don't let me go 'cause you have my soul
And I just wanted you to know

I don't wanna look back 'cause I know that we have
Something the past could never change
And now I'm stuck in the moment and my heart is open
Tell me that you feel the same

'Cause I'm 4 real, are you 4 real?
I can't help myself, it's the way I feel
When you look me in the eyes, like you did last night
I can't stand to hear you say goodbye

Well, it feels so right 'cause it feels so right
Just to have you standing by my side
So don't let me go 'cause you have my soul
And I just wanted you to know

Hold me down, hold me now
I'm safe, I'm sound when you're around
Hold me down, hold me now
I'm safe, I'm sound when you're around

I'm 4 real, are you 4 real?
I can't help myself, it's the way I feel
When you look me in the eyes, like you did last night
I can't stand to hear you say goodbye

Well, it feels so right 'cause it feels so right
Just to have you standing by my side
So don't let me go 'cause you have my soul
And I just wanted you to know

'Cause I'm 4 real, are you 4 real?
I can't help myself, it's the way I feel
When you look me in the eyes, like you did last night
I can't stand to hear you say goodbye

Well, it feels so right 'cause it feels so right
Just to have you standing by my side
So don't let me go 'cause you have my soul
And I just wanted you to know
