Oh, the walking dead have rose again
Oh, hell is rolling, 'round the best

Oh yeah, tried to walk away
But you kept coming back for more
Oh yeah, I tried to walk away
But you kept coming back, you kept coming back for more

Say what you will, say you want the end
Like you never ever had it before
I'll give you everything beyond the truth
I'll give you everything and even more

Say what you will, say you want the end
Like you never ever had it before
I'll give you everything beyond the truth
I'll give you everything and even more, more, more, more, more

Oh, the graveyard rolls again
Oh, kill it all and kill it again

Oh yeah, I tried to walk away
But you kept coming back for more
Oh yeah, I tried to walk away
But you kept coming back, you kept coming back for more

Say what you will, say you want the end
Like you never ever had it before
I'll give you everything beyond the truth
I'll give you everything and even more

Say what you will, say you want the end
Like you never ever had it before
I'll give you everything beyond the truth
I'll give you everything and even more, more, more, more, more

Say what you will, say you want the end
Like you never ever had it before
I'll give you everything beyond the truth
I'll give you everything and even more

Say what you will, say you want the end
Like you never ever had it before
I'll give you everything beyond the truth
I'll give you everything and even more, more, more, more, more
