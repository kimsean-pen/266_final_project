I'm a go getta'
It's in my bloodline, you should know better
You be hassling the pussy, boy don't stress her
I could go get her in one try just to show levels
New drip with some old leather
Look how I do it, effortless when I'm moving, yeah
Look how I do it, effortless when I'm moving, yeah
Look how I do it, effortless when I'm moving, yeah
Step up out the way, get back in your lane

No, I ain't shaking hands If I don't trust ya'
Got a problem, then it's your problem, go and fuckin' solve it
White gold with the diamonds frozen, yeah I get it going
Dripping like a surfer that just stepped up out the coldest ocean
Woah, woah
Ready to roll, made my first hunnid' K
Damaged boy with a Nelly band-aid tatted on my face
Runnin' up the Louis store, try and take away some of the pain
I'm gettin' it in any way, any time, any place on whatever day
Miami strip club settings, that's neon
It's raining in here thought it was London for a second
Please don't step on the Prada because
I'll smash the Belvedere over your head without question
Now you look tipsy tipped over
Chip on your shoulder 'cause your shit is broken
Myself to myself, I was raised as a loner (Wait, wait, wait)
Wait, hol' up

I'm a go getta'
It's in my bloodline, you should know better
You be hassling the pussy, boy don't stress her
I could go get her in one try just to show levels
New drip with some old leather
Look how I do it, effortless when I'm moving, yeah
Look how I do it, effortless when I'm moving, yeah
Look how I do it, effortless when I'm moving, yeah
Step up out the way, get back in your lane

Suited up in the casino in Reno
Cigar in the mouth, like Pacino
Never be tuckin' in chains like I'm lookin' out for D-Bo
Let my shit hang like Kobe's arms after a free throw
We don't drown where-ever
When it rains, it pours, bring the Burberry umbrella
Prepare for any weather
Yeah, I stay ahead for any situation
Okay then
Keep the bar raising
Never get complacent (No way)

I'm a go getta'
It's in my bloodline, you should know better
You be hassling the pussy, boy don't stress her
I could go get her in one try just to show levels
New drip with some old leather
Look how I do it, effortless when I'm moving, yeah
Look how I do it, effortless when I'm moving, yeah
Look how I do it, effortless when I'm moving, yeah
Step up out the way, get back in your lane
