Sorry if I ever hurt you
And I never kissed you enough
And I just have trouble unwravling sometimes
The feelings that I kept locked up
And I know its my own misfortune
And I didn't hold tight enough
But I found it hard to keep myself whole
While drowning in my bitter blood
And I hate when you're with him
And I hate when you smile
And I hate that for once you don't seem like you've cried
And I hate that you've kissed him
And I hate that I'm sore
But most of all I hate that you're happier than before
I'll stay awake again and start feeling
The spot where you used to reside

And I'll lay beneath these cold empty sheets
Huddled and clutching my sides
And I know it's my own misfortune
And darling believe me I do
And you've got your problems, and hell I've got mine
But I find it hard that we're through
And I hate when you're with him
And I hate when you smile
And I hate that for once you don't seem like you've cried
And I hate that you've kissed him
And I hate that I'm sore
But most of all I hate that you're happier than before
And I hate when you're with him
And at night you're entwined
And I hate that I have to pretend that I'm fine
And I hate that I miss you but you miss him more
But most of all I hate that you're happier than before
Most of all I hate that you're happier than before
