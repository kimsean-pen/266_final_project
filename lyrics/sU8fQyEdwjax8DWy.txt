Go!

I am an enemy of everything
My life is not for sale
My heart is in this fight forever
What can you take from me?
When there's not a single fucking day I haven't fought to stay alive

We're finding hope in the hopeless
I am still their voice that gets stuck in your head

I am me
And I have come to scare you to death
Because that's what you deserve
You disgusting piece of shit

I know the only words that you have for me
Are give up and get out
You'd like to think, that we've been beaten
But we're here to stay, forever and always

Every single day not giving up, living up all my dreams
So go ahead and look like I'm inferior (inferior)

Condescension, suffering
Callousness and loathing
Are the badges I have earned for my cause
And i am finding hope within hatred
A reason to persist to push past everything

We are here, and we have come to scare you to death
Because that's what you deserve
You fucking fake ass hypocrites

I know the only words that you have for me
Are give up and get out
You'd like to think, that we've been beaten
But we're here to stay, forever and always
So loud, we are the ones that you pushed away
For drowning your voice out
You'd like to think, we've been defeated
But we're here to stay forever and always

We've been through everything and we all have our scars
We may be broken but you can't kill all of us

Go!

Think before you fucking speak
I am no villain
Think before you fucking speak
People fear what they don't understand
And so now beauty has become the fucking beast

Maybe you didn't hear me
I said go fuck yourself!

I know the only words that you have for me
Are give up and get out
You'd like to think, that we've been beaten
But we're here to stay, forever and always
So Loud, we are the ones that you pushed away
For drowning your voice out
You'd like to think that we've been defeated
But we're here to stay forever and always
