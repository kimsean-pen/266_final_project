Giving up too much
Giving up

Be gracious
Be thankful

Giving up too much
Giving up

Be honest
Be kind

We're waiting for the universe
We're waiting for the light to lead the way
Creating what we can't reverse
Nothing will ever be the same again
You had it all, you had it all
You lost control and let it go again
We're waiting for the universe to end

You much too strong for me
And I can't hold your hand like I used to
You much too hard for me
And I can't change your heart like I used to

And all that's left to say to you
It's to smile when the lights are on
This never was enough for you
Now we both know where we belong

Giving up too much
Giving up
I've never given this much to another, no, not to another lover
Giving up too much
Giving up
I've never given so much, never given so much, so much

We're waiting for the universe
We're waiting for the light to lead the way
Creating what we can't reverse
Nothing will ever be the same again
You had it all, you had it all
You lost control and let it go again
We're waiting for the universe to end

Goodbye, good night my love
Goodbye my love
