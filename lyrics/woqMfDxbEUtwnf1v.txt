A blowy sandy wind
On the black land, my river
Iteru dies away
The end is so close, there's no crying
And now time can't go back
Can hear the black creaking doors
Of the eternal land
'Cause Anubis is on the wait
To weigh my soul

The realm of the dead will guide my mind

Rite of the passage is like a war against the odds
Dangerous gates to cross to reach the afterlife
Walls of iron, lakes of fire, spirits around
I can't bring you with me my dear, to cross Osiris' land

Yeah, I am sailing down the Nile
يا ليل يا عين
Memories like ashes in the sand

Relieve me
Leave me here I'm dying
Isis knows how to bring me back to life
So relieve me
Yeah leave me here dying
Take me to your heart, I'll stay alive

Vices, my heart on scale, time for the weighing
Ma'at's survival
Feather decides, my end draws nigh
I'm feeling
Peaceful, carried by the wind
Inside my mind

The realm of the dead will guide my mind
يا ليل يا عين
Memories like ashes in the sand

Relieve me
Leave me here I'm dying
Isis knows how to bring me back to life
So relieve me
Yeah leave me here dying
Take me to your heart, I'll stay alive

Relieve me
Leave me here I'm dying
Isis knows how to bring me back to life
So relieve me
Yeah leave me here dying
Take me to your heart, I'll stay alive
