I am a space traveller on a distant Planet X
Seeking directions back to Earth
My heartbeat's everlasting
I fear not the unknown
The thought of you drives me on

Just let it roar
There is Hell inside of me that no one knows
Just let it roar
Oh baby put your fire in my soul

I race the cosmic storm winds
To see you once again
Deep inside I know I fool myself
But I don't care
This endless journey will never take me home
I carry in me hopeless love

Just let it roar
There is Hell inside of me that no one knows
Just let it roar
Oh baby put your fire in my soul

I ride a silver angel
I've circled every star
I've touched the the edge of the universe
But the closer I try to get to you
The more far away I'll be
I wanna scream

Just let it roar
There is Hell inside of me that no one knows
Just let it roar
Yeah baby put your fire in my soul

Let it roar
