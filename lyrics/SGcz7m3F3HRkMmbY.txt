Night air has the strangest flavor
Space to breathe it, time to savor
All that night air has to lend me
Till the morning makes me angry

In the night air, in the night air
In the night air, in the night air

I've acquired a kind of madness
Daylight fills my heart with sadness
And only silent skies can soothe me
Feel that night air flowing through me

In the night air, in the night air
In the night air, in the night air

I don't need those car crash colors
I control the skies above us
Close my eyes to make the night fall
The comfort of the world revolving
I can hear the earth in orbit

In the night air, in the night air
In the night air, in the night air

I've acquired a taste for silence
Darkness fills my heart with calmness
And each thought like a thief is driven
To steal the night air from the heavens

In the night air, in the night air
In the night air, in the night air
In the night air, in the night air
In the night air, in the night air
In the night air, in the night air
In the night air, in the night air
In the night air, in the night air
