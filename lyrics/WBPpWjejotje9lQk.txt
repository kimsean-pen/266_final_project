Im standing in the moonlight, like a shadow, on a graveyard
Lonely after midnight, with an arrow, through my heart
I wanna feel the starshine, let em' sparkle, on my pale skin
I wanna climb up so high, let my hair blow, in the wind

I want to navigate through your soul, through apocalyptic black holes
Want to navigate through your soul, your soul
Oh, seize the day, get swept away
Oh, face your fear, and come my way
Oh, seize the day, get swept away
Oh, face your fear, and come my way, it's never too late
Never too late

Underneath the dark light, there's a tribal celebration
Trying hard to reach out, for the magic sensation
Like hummingbirds of the night They're singing at the sorrow
They take me to the far side, to the land of the apollo

I want to navigate through your soul, through apocalyptic black holes
Want to navigate through your soul, your soul
Oh, seize the day, get swept away
Oh, face your fear, and come my way
Oh, seize the day, get swept away
Oh, face your fear, and come my way, it's never too late
Never too late
