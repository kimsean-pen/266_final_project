I would love to scream your name
And I would gladly fall in vain, for this

Grasping memories between my hips
Your lips, graze against my skin
Gracing every inch

You know you belong in my bed
I can't get you off of my brain
Feeling like it's never enough
Cus your love's got me going insane
Insane for your love

Baby won't you come a little closer, closer
I want you to see me when I smile, I smile
Oh just once touch has got me trembling
This sin, damn it feels so good
Feels just like it should

You know you belong in my bed
I can't get you off of my brain
Feeling like it's never enough
Cus your love's got me going in-

You know you belong in my bed
I can't get you off of my brain
Feeling like it's never enough
Cus your love's got me going insane
Insane for your love

Yeah you got me insane, insane
Insane for your love

You know you belong in my bed
I can't get you off of my brain
Feeling like it's never enough
Cus your love's got me going in-

You know you belong in my bed
I can't get you off of my brain
Feeling like it's never enough
Cus your love's got me going in-

You know you belong in my bed
I can't get you off of my brain
Feeling like it's never enough
Cus your love's got me going in-

You know you belong in my bed
I can't get you off of my brain

Cus you got me insane, insane
Insane for your, your love, your love, your love

Yeah you got me
You got me insane, insane, insane
Insane for your, your love, your love, your love

You got me insane, baby (Love, love, love, love, love)
You got me insane baby
You got me insane baby
You got me insane for your love (Love, love, love)
