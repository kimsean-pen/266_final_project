Were we meant to break?
Spent more time watching me leave
I think I'm just another mistake in your way
I know you're better off alone
And that it's time for me to let you go

Into the air
Away from the mess I'm in
Been dragging you underneath
My problems again

I wanted to tell you that you're free
In time you'll see
I just weighed you down
I wanted to tell you that you're free
In time you'll see
I just weighed you down

Were we meant to stay?
Or are we made to decay?
Waited for sun
All we got was rain
Saw your smile fade
While stress took me away
But you were on my mind
On my mind

I know it feels like I just left you to die
Been gone so long, can't fucking make this right
I know it feels like I just left you to die
Been gone so long, can't fucking make this right

I wanted to tell you that you're free
In time you'll see
I just weighed you down
I wanted to tell you that you're free
In time you'll see
I just weighed you down

So were we meant to break?
Did I lose your faith?
I know that I'm the one to blame
I'm empty the same

Now, I'm empty the same
Consumed by thoughts not meant to escape
I know I'm to blame
I'm empty the same

Into the air
Away from the mess I'm in
Been dragging you underneath
My problems again

I wanted to tell you that you're free
In time you'll see
I just weighed you down
I wanted to tell you that you're free
In time you'll see
I just weighed you down
