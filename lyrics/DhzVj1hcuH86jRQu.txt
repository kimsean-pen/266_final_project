Cursed like a flame
Cause the very last light is gone
I feel something coming as the morning down the hall

Voices darkness is coming from my soul
Should I fear you or should I just let go?

Oh, blackout, I gotta know where you're from
what are you trying to tell me I don't know
oh, blackout, now this glow has come you're in the dark
I could be anyone,
Time stand still but I feel you by my side
But even this moment is running out of time

Oh, blackout, I've gotta know where you're from
what are you trying to tell me I don't know
oh, blackout, now this glow has come you're in the dark
I could be anyone,

Oh, blackout, now this glow has come.
what are you trying to tell me I don't know
oh, blackout I won't tell where you're from cause you're in the dark
I could be anyone,
don't leave, don't leave me.
