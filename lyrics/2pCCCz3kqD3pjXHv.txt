I climbed up a mountain, and looked off the edge
And all of the lies that I never have led
Is one where I stayed with you, accross the sea
I wonder do you still think of me
I carry your image always in my head
Folded and yellowed and torn at the edge
And i've look upon it for so many years
Slowy im loosing your face

(chorus)
Oh the ocean rows us away, away, away
The ocean rows us away

Sixs and sevens we live on jet planes
And so many faces I don't know the names
So many friends now and none of them mine
Forgotten as soon as we meet
All of these moments are lost in time
Your caught on my head like a thorn on a vine
But to hurt but to mend me that I wonder why
Do I wish i've never known you at all

(chorus)
Oh the ocean rows us away, away, away
The ocean rows us away

Oh the ocean rows us away, away, away
The ocean rows us away

The sun and the moon
An ocean of air
So many voices
But nothing is there
The ghost of you asking me why
Why did I leave

(chorus)

Oh the ocean rows us away, away, away
The ocean rows us away

Oh the ocean rows us away away away

And I loose your hand through the waves
