This is a public warning
Be careful when you're out
We're having freaky weather
There's a lot of it about

On the terraces it's swinging
He's a monkey on the roof
You've seen him on the tele
So let me introduce

T - O - P - M - A - N
He's naughty by nature
T - O - P - M - A - N
On doubles and chasers
T - O - P - M - A - N
Be a little boy racer
T - O - P - M - A - N
Shooting guns on the high streets of love

In a crowd it's hard to spot him
But anonymity can cost
It's never cheap or cheerful
He's Hugo and he's Boss

He's riding through the desert
On a Camel Light
And on a magic carpet
He'll fly away tonight
(Open sesame)

T - O - P - M - A - N
He's naughty by nature
T - O - P - M - A - N
On doubles and chasers
T - O - P - M - A - N
Be a little boy racer
T - O - P - M - A - N
Shooting guns on the high streets of love
T - O - P - M - A - N
He sees her in double
T - O - P - M - A - N
Then he pukes on the pavement
T - O - P - M - A - N
He likes her all clean and shaven
T - O - P - M - A - N
Shooting guns on the high streets of love

T - O - P - M - A - N
He's naughty by nature
T - O - P - M - A - N
On doubles and chasers
T - O - P - M - A - N
Be a little boy racer
T - O - P - M - A - N
Shooting guns on the high streets of love
T - O - P - M - A - N
Shooting guns on the high streets of love
T - O - P - M - A - N
Shooting guns on the high streets of love
T - O - P - M - A - N
