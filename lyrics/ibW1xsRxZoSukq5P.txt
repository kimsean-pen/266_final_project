Is your misery like before
This is what you've waited for
Take your hand walk through the door
to set my mind out

Catch you push me to the floor
Dark light, dark light break
Watch my misery be transformed
To tear your heart out

And I'll surrender
(take your hits to lay down when you're dead and gone)
Not like before
And I'll Surrender
Won't be the first to fall

And your lies the pill to take
This is what you've waited for
Shattered fists can be replaced
Just give your heart up

Powerless the life you've made
Dark light, dark light break
Live to breathe another day,
Just clear my mind out

And I'll surrender
(take your hits to lay down when you're dead and gone)
Not like before
And I'll Surrender
Won't be the first to fall

There's this voice in my head and it stops me
But these words that are said, they don't break me
God knows that everybody says I'm going
The wrong way
Down
And these stories told could be yours

And I'll surrender
(take your hits to lay down when you're dead and gone)
Not like before
And I'll Surrender
Won't be the first to fall

(Is your misery like before) And I'll surrender
(Take your hand walk through the door) And I'll surrender
(Catch you push me to the floor) And I'll surrender
(Watch my misery be transformed) I won't surrender
