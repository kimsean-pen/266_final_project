It wasn't just your innocence No It wasn't temptation
It was just your own way Of placing the blame on me
Stop thinking that it's all in vain You keep trading your love for pain
Someday an answer will come Cause there ain't no way to escape
Baby I'm a prisoner Oh Chained by love
It's so easy to see I could never be free
I'm a prisoner Chained by love Chained by love
The answer for your loneliness Was only frustration
So you gave it all away By placing the blame on me
Remember how it used to be Your lies won't die that easily
Something's wrong Why can't you see There ain't no way to escape
Baby I'm a prisoner Oh Chained by love
It's so easy to see I could never be free
I'm a prisoner Chained by love Chained by love
It's so easy to see I could never be free I'm a prisoner Chained by love--
Hold my heart in misery CAUSE I'M A PRISONER
Did my time So let me be Let me go You owe it to me---
LEAD
Someday an answer will come your way Something's wrong Why can't you see
That there ain't no way to escape Escape
Baby I'm a prisoner Oh Chained by love
It's so easy to see I could never be free
I'm a prisoner Chained by love Chained by love
It's so easy to see I could never be free
I'm a prisoner Chained by love Chained by love
BREAK
It's so easy to see I could never be free I'm a prisoner Chained by love
