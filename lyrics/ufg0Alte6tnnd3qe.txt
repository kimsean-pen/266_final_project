I was standing by the ocean when I saw your face
I couldn't look at you
I guess you knew it but I never realized
That we were through

And now I'm down here all alone with every feeling that I own
You can't take that away
And with every breath we take and the illusions we create
Will come to you someday

And I was touched
By the hand of God
Never knew it
But of course I was

I never hoped to do the things in this world
I wanted to
Because everything I own
It belongs to you

I've never looked at you in a sexual way
In my life before
And I've never woken up like this
So desperately before

And I was touched
By the hand of God
Never knew it
But of course I was
I was touched
By the hand of God
Never knew it
But of course I was

Touched
By the hand of God
Never knew it
But of course I was
I was touched
By the hand of God
Never knew it
But of course I was
Ooh
Ooh
I was touched (touched)
I was touched (touched)
