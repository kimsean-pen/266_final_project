Late nights in Lake Park
I wait for you to see me
My eyes open standing watch for hours
Wearing your favorite thing

I woke pleasing you so slowly
I'm giving you diamond
The soft light
On your man brow
I'm asking you to show me how
How

Show me now
Show me a second face
Show me
How you make your second face

Fingers situate themselves in dark
Moving a way that is so easy
And in summer bright your shot
On the surface, warm, I throw
A box full of oranges
Syrup seeping out
Searching for a season smell
I run from you then walk back to you
Who I don't know
Sniffing for a line

Show me now
Show me a second face
Show me
How you make your second face

What did I do to make you feel so bad?
What did I do that you would make me feel so bad?
What did I do to make you feel so bad?
Feel so bad
What did I do that you would make me feel so bad?
Feel so bad, baby
