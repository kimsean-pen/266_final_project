In vein endeavor, a toroid, nacreous and bright
A triptych trinity of grace and height
Perceived and obsolete, merge into decay
Defeated, primordial grandeur

Into the void - Illuminate, elucidate, enlighten once bliss
Into the light - Occult, enwomb, disguise this abyss

Orbital ubiquity, blistering shining surface
A freedom of faith, conscience and creed
Spangled with stars, perished inanity
Vanished, dissolving polarity

Beyond all matter and moral
Within perpetual infinity
This cosmic body, a transcendent reality
This absolute unity, a multitude of forms

A human shell, scattered in eternal silence
A perennial stream of recurring thoughts
Trapped forever, as stellar ion cluster
Enchained, in idle captured state

Time - An Aeon of strain
Time - A sinuous deformity

This cosmic body, a transcendent reality
This absolute unity, a multitude of forms

Beyond all matter and moral
Within perpetual infinity
Unique universal spirits
As vivid and pure
