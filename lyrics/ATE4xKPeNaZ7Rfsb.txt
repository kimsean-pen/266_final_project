When the hurt is let in
Or the galls of feel all darken
For there is that girl I'm lovin
But they rip to wife or jumping
(Boy) life of boy where do you sleep? (boy, dance)
There's the girl where do you go?
(Boy) life of boy what do you see? (boy, dance)
What do you know, what do you know?
(Boy) why should I be a fantasy?
Don't nobody know no one else is?
Why would I be
Like a child they found dead again?
When the hurt is lit in lieu
Of the gall that feel all darkened
For there is that girls out lovin
But they rip to wife or jumping
(Boy) life of boy where do you sleep? (boy, dance)
There's the girl what do you see?
(Boy) life of boy how much do you know? (boy, dance)
What do you know, what do you know?
(Girl) why should I be a fantasy?
Don't nobody know no one else is?
Why would I be
Like a child they found dead again?
