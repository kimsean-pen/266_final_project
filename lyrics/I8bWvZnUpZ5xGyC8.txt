Take some Venom and Accept
That you won't see Nazareth
The Rainbow leads you home

Warrior sent to Milky Way
UFO shooting Gamma Ray
A Riot of Destruction

Watch the Rockbitch go Down, Vixen spread

When the Priest killed the Maiden in the Metal Church
Armored Saints and Warlocks watched the Slaughter
Rage of the Slayer forced the Pretty Maids
To Kiss the Queen in Crimson Glory

You were born a Motörhead
Bike's In Flames you race ahead
Udo the Kansas Rush

Racing with the Mötley Crüe
Annihilator chasing you
With Guns and burning Roses

Status Quo has been reached, Wasp's Unleashed

When the Priest killed the Maiden in the Metal Church
Armored Saints and Warlocks watched the Slaughter
Rage of the Slayer forced the Pretty Maids
To Kiss the Queen in Crimson Glory
(Guitar Solo)
Take a Skyride with me, then you'll see
When the Priest killed the Maiden in the Metal Church
Armored Saints and Warlocks watched the Slaughter
Rage of the Slayer forced the Pretty Maids
To Kiss the Queen in Crimson Glory
