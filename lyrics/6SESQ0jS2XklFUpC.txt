Baby come back to me
Baby come back to me
Baby don't set me free
Come back, come back please
You left me
You're gone
I'm living in the dark
I'm a wreck
I'm lost
A prisoner of your love

You're the one in my dreams
It's you
You're the only one for me
The one that I need
It's you
Baby come back to me

Baby where you going now
Baby where you going now
Take the pistol out your mouth
Baby don't you take me down
I cry for you
I saw you sinking deep
I'm holding on
It's not your time to leave

You're the one in my dreams
It's you
You're the only one for me
The one that I need
It's you
Baby come back to me

Take me back to you my love
Hold me in your arms
I won't hurt you anymore
And I won't let you down
Don't forget the love that we had
All we went through
In low and in high tide
I'll never fail you

You're the one in my dreams
It's you
You're the only one for me
The one that I need
It's you
Baby come back to me
