Just you and me, getting high and hanging out
Getting high and messing around
Getting high, and trying to figure it out
There was a sacrificial ritual inside my room last night
It was held there in secret, hard to see anything in the candle light
Now, there is melted wax all over my floor
And the scent of incense is rising up from underneath the door
Now, maybe it was not as serious as I am making it sound
Just, you and me getting high and hanging out
Getting high and messing around
Getting high, trying to figure it out
I feel the burn, my tired feet not much to go a few more streets
To see your face is all I need, my one and only, my sweet relief
And, you would think I never had it the way that this world mocks my magic
But, it was all for you to continue to be able
To continue to be able right now
Just you and me, getting high and hanging out
Getting high and messing around
Getting high, trying to figure it out
I don't need your reasons anymore
Don't need your reasons anymore,
Need your reasons anymore
I put my wrong finger in the hot wax,
Now, I can't play for you like that
The last thing I need, it's true,
Would be a stupid reason excuse for a reason to fight back
I can't begin, begin to tell you the way it all felt
When everything fell through
(GDP) You moved to New York to meet a beautiful girl
And drink fancy cocktails without a care in the world
But, you got scared they're all gonna find someone else
So, you find one and tell it things you're dying to tell
We got high as hell, and I forget how it went
It was a song about love, and at the time, it made sense
When the song ended, we just layed there in bed
You had fallen asleep, but I stayed up and read
I made a list of everything I said I never meant
Considered all the things I never said but I digress
I got dressed, kissed your forehead and left
You call me when you woke, but I was sleeping off the meds
