I wanna be loved
Don't wanna be hated
I wanna be friends
Don't wanna all this fake shit
I try all of that, I'm giving it back
I feel under pressure, I wanna relax
I wanna be messed up
Don't wanna be jaded

I'm too mixed up
(Too mixed up)
I'm too many colors
I'm too mixed up
(Too mixed up)
I'm too many colors
(Too many colors)

Am I in love or just obsessed
I didn't stop this gorgeous mess
I play this song like half to death
And everything's alright

I wanna be soft
I wanna be tasteful
I wanna be fair
I wanna be graceful
But I still loved it when it's maxed out (Maxed out)
Lean hard, pass out
Either way, I wanna be graceful

I'm too mixed up
(Too mixed up)
I'm too many colors
I'm too mixed up
(Too mixed up)
I'm too many colors
(Too many colors)

Am I in love or just obsessed
I didn't stop this gorgeous mess
I play this song like half to death
And everything's alright

We wanna be cool
We wanna be famous
We wanna be quiet
We wanna be faceless
And we want too many things
To give them an answer of who we should be
Or what we believe (hey)
We wanna be careless

I'm too mixed up
(Too mixed up)
We're too many colors
I'm too mixed up
(Too mixed up)
We're too many colors
I'm too mixed up
(Too mixed up)
We're too many colors
(Too many colors)
I'm too mixed up
(Too mixed up)
I'm too many colors
I'm too mixed
(Too mixed up)
I'm too many colors
(Too mixed up)
I'm too many colors
