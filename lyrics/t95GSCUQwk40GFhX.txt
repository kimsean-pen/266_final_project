I was unfinished, unclaimed
He sees me, I remember well

But he can't
That was nice
A distance of mine
I let it slide, I let it slide

Run and face, so different
A face appeared
I launch and I turn around
Touch, it's nice to touch her
We're the dust we see
Dust behind us

Nothing here, we are ungraced
All alone in the sea
