It was your palms and your feet
And every single thing between
We were an easy thing to do
I enthused over you
But melancholia...
Insomnia...
Saudade
They had me
It's hard to forget I'm looking back on a time
When every beat in your heart was beating for mine

You had the world at your feet
And you kicked it back at me
I had a hole in my heart
And you didn't have the decency to wait and see
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
Between the angels and infinity
There is a hideaway, a place to be for me
And when I'm better you can set me free

It's safe to say that you were mine
A songbird to a morning sunrise
How I miss my spotless mind
I lost it to the twilight
Much like our love
A songbird always flies without regret
And even after everything
We perished when the sun set

You had the world at your feet
And you kicked it back at me
I had a hole in my heart
And you didn't have the decency to wait and see
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
Between the angels and infinity
There is a hideaway, a place for me
And only when I'm better you can set me free

Every blind spot, and every nicety
I learned about your heart...
I watched them perish before me
