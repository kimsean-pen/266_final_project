I feel at home with shadows from ghosts of the living
I dance along to melodies as silent choirs sing
I'm sick of always giving when there's nothing left to lose
This place we're in is breaking, it's trying to break me too

I built these walls to keep the outside world from me
And I'll fight to stay in the hell of my own mind
It's safer on the inside
Underneath, where you can't ever get to me
And I'll fight to stay in the hell of my own mind
It's safer on the inside

Build these walls
It's safer on the inside
Build these walls
It's safer on the inside

Chaos reigns
Inside of all of us
All this pain
It's not where I belong
It's not my fate
And you're a hypocrite
You're the dying proof of it
Now I know

Broken people just like you can be so dangerous
Knowing you'll survive by feeding off the rest of us

I built these walls to keep the outside world from me
And I'll fight to stay in the hell of my own mind
It's safer on the inside
Underneath, where you can't ever get to me
And I'll fight to stay in the hell of my own mind
It's safer on the inside

Built these walls
It's safer on the inside
Built these walls
It's safer on the inside
Built these walls
It's safer on the inside
Built these walls
It's safer on the inside

It's safer on the inside
It's safer on the inside

I built these walls to keep the outside world from me
And I'll fight to stay in the hell of my own mind
It's safer on the inside
It's safer on the inside
It's safer on the inside
Underneath, where you can't ever get to me
And I'll fight to stay in the hell of my own mind
It's safer on the inside

Built these walls
It's safer on the inside
Built these walls
It's safer on the inside
Built these walls
It's safer on the inside
Built these walls
It's safer on the inside
