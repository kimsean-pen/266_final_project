She's a crooked Sheriff in a real straight town
She opened the door shake shake the lights go down
Clover honey and the Jimson Weed
Red leather skirt way up above her knees
Oh yeah, my baby's lowdown

She's a gone lost dirt road
There ain't no way back I been told
Well she's a story they all tell
She's a rebel, she's a yell
Oh yeah, my baby's lowdown

White heat in a cold rain
I'm a mergin here in your mergin lane
Jockey La Fayette, Big Eyed Al

The second hand moon's shining for my gal
She's a big red flag in a mean bullpen
She'll steal it from you, sell right
Back to you again
Well she's a whild rose, she's not settled
Cold gun of ice blue metal, oh
My baby's lowdown

White heat in a cold rain
I'm a mergin here in your mergin lane
Jockey la Fayette, Big Eyed Al

She's a cheap motel with a burned out sign
She'll take care of you definitely every time
She got a stolen check book and leg's upto here
Singing into a hairbrush
Right in front of the mirror
Oh yeah, my baby's lowdown
