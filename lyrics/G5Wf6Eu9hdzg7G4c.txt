Oh yeah!

Monday, Tuesday
We were cool.
Wednesday,
I found out 'bout you.

Caught my heart by tellin' lies.
You weren't what you advertised.
But silly me to believe.
Oh! Oh! Oh!

I was unique.
When I'm there you put on a show.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
You gotta go!
'Cause what's true about you?
Who are you when I'm gone?
Wanted to be with you,
Don't know what I was on!

'Cause you got me to forget me.

Oh! Oh Oh!
You know that's true!
Yeah you got me to forget me.
So, Friday I'll be over you!

Oh yeah!
No, no I ain't gonna cry.
Go and be with her tonight.
I really don't care what you do.

'Cause Friday I'll be over you!
And silly me to believe,
Oh! Oh! Oh!
I was unique.
When I'm there you put on a show.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
You gotta go!
'Cause what's true about you?

Who are you when I'm gone?
Wanted to be with you,

Don't know what I was on!
'Cause you got me to forget me.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
You know that's true!

Yeah you got me to forget me.
So, Friday I'll be over you!
