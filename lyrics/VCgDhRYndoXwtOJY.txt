Laid back, there's no need to hide
Watchin' TV with the gun at my side
There's no time to make a decision
I have to pay dues for the life I've been livin'
I can't stop, I can't see what's comin'
Goin' through hell with a chainsaw runnin'
Revved up I'm ready to blaze
Got no regrets 'cause it's the end of days
Nowhere, no one, no, our time, over

We're all gonna die one way or another
So while I'm alive I'll be a bad motherfucker, I'm bad
(I'm bad) I'm bad (I'm bad)
Worst nightmare you've ever had

Cold steel and a tank of gas
Ridin' through a desert made of broken glass
I see the edge, it's comin' fast
But I don't care if I come in last
Maybe I'm a fool to think that I can make it all the way
With everything against me all my confidence decays
I can hear it in the distance it's the devil's cry
I can see my name written in a burning sky
Nowhere, no one, no, our time, over

We're all gonna die one way or another
So while I'm alive I'll be a bad motherfucker, I'm bad
(I'm bad) I'm bad (I'm bad)
Keepin' it straight in a world gone mad
We're all gonna die one way or another
So while I'm alive I'll be a bad motherfucker, I'm bad
(I'm bad) I'm bad (I'm bad)
Worst nightmare you've ever had

Run, run away from me
'Cause time is blood, and blood is time
Run, run, run away from me
'Cause it all drains away

I'm not afraid to die
My soul is empty now
The clock, the ticking stops
And we are undone
Nowhere, no one, no, our time, over

We're all gonna die one way or another
So while I'm alive I'll be a bad mother-mother...
We're all gonna die one way or another
So while I'm alive I'll be a bad mother-mother... I'm bad
I'm bad, I'm bad

We're all gonna die one way or another
So while I'm alive I'll be a bad motherfucker, I'm bad
(I'm bad) I'm bad (I'm bad)
Keepin' it straight in a world gone mad
We're all gonna die one way or another
So while I'm alive I'll be a bad motherfucker, I'm bad
(I'm bad) I'm bad (I'm bad)
Worst nightmare you've ever had
