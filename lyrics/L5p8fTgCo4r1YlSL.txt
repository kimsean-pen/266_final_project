Run, run, run away,
Buy yourself another day.
A cold wind's whispering secrets in your ear.
So low only you can hear.
Run, run, run and hide

Somewhere no one else can find.
Tall trees bend their lean pointing where to go,
Where you will still be all alone.
Don't you fret, my dear.

It'll all be over soon.
I'll be waiting here for you.

Run fast if you can.

No one has to understand.
Fly high across the sky from here to kingdom come.
Fall back down to where you're from.
Don't you fret, my dear.
It'll all be over soon.

I'll be waiting here for you.
For you, for you.
Don't you fret, my dear (Don't you fret, my dear).
It'll all be over soon (It'll all be over soon).

I'll be waiting here...
Don't you fret, my dear.
It'll be over soon.
I'll be waiting here for you for you.
For you.
Run, run, run away...
Run, run, run away...
