Dance, it's all I wanna do
So won't you dance? I'm standing here with you
Why won't you move? I'll get inside your groove
'Cause I'm on fire, fire, fire, fire

It hurts when you get too close
But, baby, it hurts if love is really good
You just want more, even if it throws you
To the fire, fire, fire, fire

All the lovers that have gone before
They don't compare
To you

Don't be frightened
Just give me a little bit more
They don't compare
All the lovers

Feel, can't you see there's so much here to feel?
Deep inside your heart you know I'm real
Can't you see that this is
Goin' higher, higher, higher, higher

Breathe, I know you find it hard
But, baby, breathe, you'll be next to me
It's all you need and I'll take you there
I'll take you higher, higher, higher

All the lovers that have gone before
They don't compare
To you

Don't be frightened
Just give me a little bit more
They don't compare
All the lovers

Dance, it's all I wanna do
So won't you dance? I'm standing here with you
Why won't you move?
Even if it throws you to the fire, fire, fire, fire...

All the lovers that have gone before
They don't compare
To you

Don't be frightened
Just give me a little bit more
They don't compare
All the lovers
