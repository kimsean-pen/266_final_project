Got some bad news this morning
Which in turn made my day
When there's someone spoke I listened
All of a sudden has less and less to say
Ohh, how could this be?
All this time I've lived vicariously

Who's gonna save my soul now?
Who's gonna save my soul now?
How will my story ever be told now?
How will my story be told now?

Made me feel like somebody
Like somebody else
Although he was imitated often
Felt like I was being myself
Is it a shame that someone else's song
Was totally and completely depended on?

Who's gonna save my soul now?
Who's gonna save my soul now?
I wonder if I'll live to grow old now
Getting high 'cause I feel so alone now

And maybe it's a little selfish
All I have is the memory
Did I never stop to wonder
Was it possible you were hurting worse than me?
Still my hunger turns to greed
'Cause what about what I need?

And ohh
Who's gonna save my soul now?
Who's gonna save my soul now?
Ohh, I know I'm out of control now
Tired enough to lay my own soul down
