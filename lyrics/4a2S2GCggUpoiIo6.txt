Come to my hidden dance
Around my arms
Round
And I'll keep until that you want me, baby
Come to my hidden base
And around the stars
May I keep you warm?
I am mighty

Are you dying?
Ten feet up, ten feet up
Are you crying?
Time to stop, time to stop

Can
Can I hear your dance around myself?
Can you recall the alarm?
Being mighty

Are you dying?
Ten feet up, ten feet up
Are you crying?
Time to stop, time to still

Are you dying?
Ten feet up, ten feet up
Are you crying?
Time to stop, time to stop

Are you dying?
Ten feet up, ten feet up
Are you crying?
Time to stop, time to still
