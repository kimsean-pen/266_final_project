Your room, I leave
wide door open for me
- dead leaves upon the grass.
I walk myself clean through 70 dreams,
We broke like a paper seam.
But when it breaks don't cry,
I'll always hold some place for you.

I'm over you, get under me
This is the last time,
don't say it's the last time.
Call me up -
you've got me choking up.
If we're in love,
tonight we can getaway.

Too soon, I'll wait, they say
"Boy you should know,
this will never work out".

But you say "you're my best friend
- boy you should know -
what if forever works out?"
"Then if it works let's try?
I'll always hold some place for you".

I'm over you, get under me
This is the last time,
don't say it's the last time.
Call me up -
you've got me choking up.
If we're in love,
tonight we can getaway.

You said 'How could I?'
I say "it's a long time coming",
You say "Can we try?"
I say "It's a waste of time lovin'"

I'm over you, get under me
This is the last time,
don't say it's the last time.
Call me up -
you've got me chocking up.
If we're in love,
tonight we can getaway.

Tonight we can getaway
Tonight we can getaway
Tonight we can getaway
