Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you baby (dream about you baby)
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you no more
(dream about you baby)

When you left you took the sun right out of my sky
I'm wondering why you went away, never told me why
And then the sun goes down and the moon is near
I'm scared to death 'cause your face appear

Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you baby (dream about you baby)
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you no more
(dream about you baby)

Loneliness is haunting me when I go to bed honey
Like a character in a book that I have read huh
Now when the sun goes down the moon is near
I'm scared to death 'cause your face appears

Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it

Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you baby (dream about you baby)
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you no more
(dream about you baby)

When the sun goes down and the moon is near
I'm scared to death 'cause your face appears

Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you baby (dream about you baby)
Dream! No! No! (hold back the night, turn on the lights)
No more! No more! No more! (Don't wanna dream)
(dream about you baby)

So tired baby! (Hold back the night, turn on the lights)
Don't want to dream about you baby (Dream about you baby)
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you baby (dream about you baby)
