I've been talking to myself, acting kinda crazy
Coming with that money, but that money make me lazy
I don't need no saving, I just need a savings
Coming with that money, but that money make me lazy
Talking to myself, acting like a ghost
Fucking with these hoes but these hoes do the most
I got jelly for the toast, amateur to pro
I can make you go, I got Anna and Nicole

Couple lessons in the pool, big house, yeah, it's full
Take a swim with some power tools and my molecules
I'm a butterfly, with some cat eyes
I'm a submarine, under a limousine

I've been talking to myself, acting kinda crazy
Coming with that money, but that money make me lazy
I don't need no saving, I just need a savings
Coming with that money, but that money make me lazy
Talking to myself, like, like a ghost
Fucking with these hoes but these hoes do the most
I got jelly for the, I got jelly for the

I'm like no breaks, I'm a space shuttle
Calling every play, but never in the huddle

I've been talking to myself, acting kinda crazy
Coming with that money, but that money make me lazy
I don't need no saving, I just need amazing
Waterfall chasing, I'm the one baking ooh
