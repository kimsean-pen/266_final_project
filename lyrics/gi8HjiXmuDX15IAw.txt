Here I am, I'm the master of your destiny
I am the one, the only one, I am the God of kingdom come
Gimme the prize, just gimme the prize

Give me your kings, let me squeeze them in my hands
Your puny princes
Your so-called leaders of your land
I'll eat them whole before I'm done
The battle's fought and the game is won

I am the one, the only one
I am the God of kingdom come
Gimme the prize
Just gimme the prize

Move over, I said, move over
Hey, hey, hey, clear the way
There's no escape from my authority, I tell you

I am the one, the only one, I am the God of kingdom come
Gimme the prize, just gimme the prize
I am the one, the only one
I am the God of kingdom come
Gimme the prize
There can be only one
