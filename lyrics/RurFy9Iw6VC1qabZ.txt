One certain hand
Pushing my back forward
One confident hand
Pushing my chest back
With every deep breath
So little oxygen takes
Woke up without sleeping
Sighed without holding my
I think...

Woke up without sleeping
Sighed without holding my
Woke up without sleeping
Sighed without holding my
Woke up without sleeping
Sighed without holding my
Woke up without sleeping
Sighed without holding my
I think
At least I think

Porcelain, wet, and concrete

One certain hand
Pushing my back forward
One confident hand
Pushing my chest back
One certain hand
Pushing my back forward
Woke up without sleeping
Sighed without holding my
