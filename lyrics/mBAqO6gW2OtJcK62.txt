I want this love eternal
I don't care for my soul
when the lights go out for good
will you kiss me still
I'd do anything to keep that weight off you
but if it drags me down
will you kiss me still
I've been clean since the night we first met
but when I go back to dope
will you kiss me still
I don't want to lie here alone
will you lie beside me now
& kiss me still
all I want in life is to wilt in your love
when it all turns into dust
will you kiss me still
if no more beauty comes until the day I'm dead
will it have all been enough
will you still feel loved?
