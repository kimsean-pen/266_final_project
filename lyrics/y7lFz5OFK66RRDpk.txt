Are you buried alive?

I know you're rotting inside and no one knows you're hurting
You're searching for light, but all you know is burning
Can't find the cure for something no one can see
Can't find the answers when there's no room left to breath

Trapped in
The darkness swallowing
Desperate to feel yourself again
Too late
I see no hope in your eyes
Are you buried alive?

I can't stop, my path is set
All I know is violence

I know you're rotting inside and no one knows you're hurting
You're searching for light, but all you know is burning
Can't find the cure for something no one can see
Can't find the answers when there's no room left to breath

Trapped in
The darkness swallowing
Desperate to feel yourself again
Too late
I see no hope in your eyes
Are you buried alive?

I'm a liar, deceiver it dwells inside
I'm a cynic, I'm desperate to find out why
All the whispers of every last demon inside
If I listen to them, they will take my life

Silence!

Can't find the cure for something no one can see
It won't stop
