Triumph through tragedy. Every decision, every choice that we make
All it takes is just one victory or just one simple mistake
To change the course. Count the loss. Determine the road that we must take
The road that we create
Strength through the determined
Can't you see that triumphs through tragedy?
Cause us be there's no illusion. This life will drag you through so much despair
Draw your own conclusion. Through reason and purpose we persevere
To change the course. Count the loss determine the road that we must take
The road that we create
Strength will bleed through the determined
Can't you see we have a purpose
All we need is to believe. There is triumph through tragedy
Never give in to despair and hopelessness
Never give in when your will begins to break
Never give in
When you're on the edge step back to find your balance
When the walls are closing in tear them down
