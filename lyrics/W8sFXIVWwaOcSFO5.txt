hollow visions
verse
all the thoughts that live inside keep growing
theres no nightmares, all dreams, all dreams
your futures sought, caught
what you've always wanted what you need
feel all the visions all around bring clarity
and find exactly what you find and seek
but fossilised thoughts never really turn out
as to be
cus theres no use
they are
hollow visions x 3
loose
they are
hollow visions x 3
hollow visions all around me
hollow visions you'll see, i'll see
the fossilised thoughts swirling all around is like a dream
the futures died and lies around no clarity
these hollow visions, hollow visions, hollow visions
are just the dark taunts
shadows curing all that we can be
so theres no use
they are hollow visions
were bound and tied (with)
hollow vision our future blind
hollow visions don't bear in mind
hollow visions its no world of mine
hollow visions
fossilized thoughts never really turn out as to be
all the thoughts that lived inside kept growing
theres all nightmares, no dreams, no dreams
the futures died and lies around no clarity
never find when you find and seek
cus fossilised thoughts never
turn out as to be (theres no use)
