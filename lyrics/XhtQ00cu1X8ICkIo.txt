Hit em' with a brick, hit em' with a bat
Hit em' with a brick, hit em' with a bat
Smash a little prick, hurt a little prat, when I
Hit em' with a brick or hit em' with a bat,

From the off and the get go
O, could take their best shot, cos their best flow slow,
Then nigga, they want chat like they kept up
No there's only one boss to the next up pro,
O Kiddi K, yo, did he say, that
Did he make, dough, 'fore he sprayed, raps
Oh yeah, giggity, and your bae got a spag
Said she went home, but she came to the flat
She got on mine, it's as snakey as that
But don't mind, you'll catch an A to the back
It's only a matter of time, before I conquer the map
You playing conkers with me? I cause the conker to crack
See, I'm nice when I see you, so I can afford a masseuse
She says she senses my chi and suggested subtle cahoots
A criminal, considering she wouldn't fuck if she knew
I'm planning world domination while she ucking the oo
Trust, this is the truth, fuck, what's a brother to do?
Them man are plugging, unplugging, then plugging the food
It's like they like it, trust me when they run to the loo
It's got me thinking they're enjoying trying to hide what they do
It's kinda worrying that man are out there lying to you
So I'm tying my shoes, and kicking them for trying to tune
Bruh, if you was that good you'd have a Fire in the Booth
You better settle down boy, you got some climbing to do
You likkle pussy, you man do what Simon would do
You wait for commands, never try inspiring youths
Whereas G's affect the culture when we vibe in the booth
We're vibing the root, that's why the fandom like what we do
Write on the route, then man have got some driving to do
Them man are plugging, unplugging, then plugging the food
Yeah they repeat it, hope you know it's something that's true
So far in this tune I've just been rhyming like you, but wait
Look at the way that I'm fucking the game when I'm
Picking and packing the place, you're in a predicament
Talking and ticking, this ting is about go off in your face
No tick or attacker is hitting the back of the net
I'm a Balotelli you're a bum
The [?] brothers are bombs
I'm good at conjuring sums
The sicker the rapper, and trickier the pattern
The bigger the badder the bar
The bigger the badder the cheque
The bigger the badder the yard
The quicker the radder the car
The thicker the back on the bras
The pickier that man have become
The bigger, the badder the beast
The bigger the brat that is done
Brother I'm ready for war, you know but wait
Man ain't fucking about with no alternate occupation
Figure the way I came and fucked the game with no procrastination
Did it and upped with minimal fuss
It's evident that, we're not on the same shit
Man, they be talking a bag of the bull
And a bag of the bull never something I'm taking
Anaphylactic shock, for gal that go down and suck these nuts
But manna are telling me G keep up with man and the
Eminem [?], busting
In fact I'm a problem for all of them man, you know man
I'm a problem for all of the dons, run em along
Ca Wizzy be here, and Wizzy be strong
So what is it? Like, what is it on?
Cus man, I got bars for them, to cart a Cartier
And half of them, so I can't laugh until I'm bunnin harder
Than regard to men, they laughing now, and catching argot
I'll amend ya, I'll offend ya,
I'll astand it, how the kids are passing em but
Wait
Man ain't fucking about with no alternate dumb suggestion
Figure the way I stroke that pussy on my crazy punch selection
Dipping and ducking, minimal fuss,
a swift upper cut, it's something you're getting
Mandem be talking a bag of the bull,
and the man they be chatting cus they see us on set and
Wait, you ain't moving weight, and you ain't pushing weight
So why you in my face? Getting all up in my space?
Got some young niggas, and they like to swing
So I hit them with the swing, like
Sway, look him in the face, who's he trying to be?
Who's he trying to copy? Better not be me
Slap him in the cheek, take a couple tooth
The little nook will get a little bit of
This, a little bit of that
So when I hear the shit, the smelly kind of chat
I tell him how it is, and yeah they might react
So I hit em' with a brick, or hit em' with a bat
A little bit of this, a little bit of that
So when I hear the shit, the smelly kind of chat
I tell him how it is, and yeah they might react
So I hit em' with a brick, or hit em' with a bat

Hit em' with a brick, hit em' with a bat
Hit em' with a brick, hit em' with a bat
Smash a little prick, hurt a little prat, when I
Hit em' with a brick or hit em' with a bat,
