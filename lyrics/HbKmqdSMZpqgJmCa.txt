It was always for fun
Stick 'n' pokes on the run
It was always for laughs
What are you doing right now?

We were always in a rush
We didn't eat very much
We didn't sleep very much
What are you doing right now?

I called you on the phone
Do you ever feel alone?
Would you like to feel alone with me right now?

Just meet me by the bridge
I wanna show you how to live
And if you show me how you live
Let's get started

And if you meet me by the bridge
I wanna show you how to live
And if you show me how you live
Let's get started

It was always for fun
We weren't hurting no one
But are we still having fun?
Are we still having fun?

We were always in a rush
We didn't eat very much
We didn't sleep very much
What are you doing right now?

I called you on the phone
Do you ever feel alone?
Would you like to feel alone with me right now?

Just meet me by the bridge
I wanna show you how to live
And if you show me how you live
Let's get started

And if you meet me by the bridge
I wanna show you how to live
And if you show me how you live
Let's get started
