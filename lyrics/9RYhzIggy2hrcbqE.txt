Now when you say you want to slow down
Does it mean you want to slow dance?
Maybe you want a little extra time
To focus on our romance.

What do you mean I got it backwards?
You know we're gonna be forever.
Why are you tellin' me goodbye?
Aren't you gonna stay the night?

Are we really over now?
Maybe I can change your mind?
Soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times.

Now I walk under a pink sky, (ooh)
Love has flown along and passed me by.
I pour my heart out to your voicemail
Let you you know I caught a bus
To your side of town.

And now I'm standing at your doorstep
(Ooh), with Los Angeles behind me.
If you don't answer I'll just use the key
That I copied 'cause I really need to see you.

If your not here when I break in
I'm gonna go to your closet
Just so I can smell you skin.
As the chemicals swim
I know I'll never love again
I swear I'll never love again!

Baby, are we over now?
Maybe I can change your mind?
As soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times!

I'm not one of those crazy girls
I'm not one of those crazy girls
I'm not one of those crazy girls
I'm not one of those crazy girls

Hey, baby, are we over now?
Maybe I can change your mind?
As soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times!

Baby, are we over now?
Maybe I can change your mind?
Soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times!
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.
Now I'm one of those crazy girls
Now I'm one of those crazy girls
Now I'm one of those crazy girls
Now I'm one of those crazy girls
