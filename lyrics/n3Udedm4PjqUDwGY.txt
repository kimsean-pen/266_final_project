Standing in ash, the tide the monsters ain't working
Mine is known from worry yet its always broken
Try to cry sometime but can't, cuz' choking
Sitting while the world outside keeps on turning
Everything is everything (woo wo wo wo)
Oh I don't plan to never ring (rang)
If you're making ends, baby don't complain (no no no no)
Because everything is everything (thing)
Cute girl from the corner, store stop the curtain
tried this love once or twice but it ain't working
Long gone all things that define an old lady
Things doesn't change from when he was a little baby
Somebody tell the man!
Everything is everything (woo wo wo wo)
Oh I don't plan to never ring (rang)
If you're making ends, baby don't complain (no no no no)
Because everything is everything (thing)
Everything is everything (woo wo wo wo)
Oh I don't plan to never ring (rang)
If you're making ends, baby don't complain (no no no no)
Because everything is everything (thing)
Roaches in this place the one thats not running
The highest blast in outside Juben lifes been playing
The summers hot, the women so fine the birds are singing
It's a feels down when theres people worse off
Doing everything they can!
Everything is everything (woo wo wo wo)
Oh I don't plan to never ring (rang)
If you're making ends, baby don't complain (no no no no)
Because everything is everything (thing)
Everything is everything (woo wo wo wo)
Oh I don't plan to never ring (rang)
If you're making ends, baby don't complain (no no no no)
Because everything is everything (thing)
Everything is everything (woo wo wo wo)
Oh I don't plan to never ring (rang)
If you're making ends, baby don't complain (no no no no)
Because everything is everything (thing)
