In the end
I saw you
Visions of something
I wasn't used to
And I let it all go
In my heart, in my body
In all
And it all go, go
And it all go
And it all go
And it all was going to come around
And i knew it will be all
Feel my heart my soul in fire
And I won't know,
No I won't know
Who you are
Cause it all falls
Cause it all falls down
And it all falls down
And it all falls down
And you never let it go
Cause it all falls down
