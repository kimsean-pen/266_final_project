Too wild to care, you got animal stare
You can't stay anywhere in your eyes
Think you're leadin' me on but you can be anyone
'Cause I know you'll be gone 'fore I rise

An' we're goin' through the motions
Yeah, we're goin' through the motions
Yeah, we're goin' through the motions
Goin' through the motions

Stayin' with you gave us somethin' to do
I almost thought it was true for a while
'Cause there's love in your lies, you're so thinly disguised
You couldn't tell right from wrong if you tried

An' we're goin' through the motions
Yeah, we're goin' through the motions
Yeah, we're goin' through the motions
Goin' through the motions

To thee I dedicate this photograph
I'll even sign it 'Love to you' again
And when it's faded and forgotten in some book
You'll sometimes look, you'll sometimes look, you'll sometimes look

It's a game, it's a game, no let's call it a shame
'Cause there's no one to blame just to pay
You were a friend for a day, so don't cry if I say
That you got what you want, it's okay

An' we're goin' through the motions
Yeah, we're goin' through the motions
Yeah, we're goin' through the motions
Goin' through the motions

Yeah, yeah, we're goin' through the motions
Yeah, we're goin' through the motions
Yeah, we're goin' through the motions
Goin' through the motions

Hey hey, yeah, yeah
We're goin', yeah, yeah, yeah, we're goin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, we're goin'
