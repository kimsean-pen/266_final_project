Evergreens in a dream of an island ave
Draw a line in the sand and we'll smooth it down
At least I will get in the middle, call my phone anytime
And we'll try, to guess right
Waking when the white sunlight's out
Waiting through the days and nights out
It's a slow cinnamon summer
Your spell's pulling me under
Going in a wooded hollow
Showing me the moves to follow
It's a slow cinnamon summer
Your spell's pulling me under
It's a hand on the ground that's around for an hour of hope
It disappears as the sea takes it in and swallows it whole
And just as it leaves, just as it's sinking
The morning will save our souls
From too cold, to keep low
Waking when the white sunlight's out
Waiting through the days and nights out
It's a slow cinnamon summer
Your spell's pulling me under
Going in a wooded hollow
Showing me the moves to follow
It's a slow cinnamon summer
Your spell's pulling me under
Waking when the white sunlight's out
Waiting through the days and nights out
It's a slow cinnamon summer
Your spell's pulling me under
Waking when the white sunlight's out
Waiting through the days and nights out
It's a slow cinnamon summer
Your spell's pulling me under
Going in a wooded hollow
Showing me the moves to follow
It's a slow cinnamon summer
Your spell's pulling me under
