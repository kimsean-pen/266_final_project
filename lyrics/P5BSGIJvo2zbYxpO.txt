When you just give love and never get love
You? d better let love depart
I know it's so and yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Your sweet love brings such misery
Misery and pain
I guess I'll never, never, never
Never, never be the same
Since I fell for you

It's so bad, it's so sad but I'm in love, in love with you
You love me but then you turn around and snub me
Oh, what am I supposed to do?
I'm still in love with you

I guess, I, I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues most every night, every night
Since I fell for you

Ooh, what a day, ooh, when I met ya
How would I know? Ooh, but what can I do?
Because I'm still in love with you

I guess I'll never, never, never
Never, never, never see the light
I get the blues most every night, every, every night
Since I fell for you, since I fell for you

What can I do without you?
