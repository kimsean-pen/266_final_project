Tell my thoughts to resign
And lift you from my mind
I'm not ready, I'm not strong enough
To cradle the weight of your love

Just take a minute, take a breath
Lay down your head on my sunken chest
I saw a flicker, then just smoke
But as you left I was calling your name at the night

Thought we were done
Young love will keep us young
I thought we were done
Young love will keep us young

I thought we fell to the ground
I see you whimper with no sound
Open my mouth to breathe some words of peace
But the silence gives nothing back to me

So I'll be a shadow of the flame
I'll bend down to kiss you then erase my name
And I'll be a whisper on the wind
My hands are shaking from holding so tight for so long

The flame burned out in a??
But now I see it's got nothing to do
It's got nothing to do with you

I thought we were done
Young love will keep us young
I thought we were done
Young love will keep us young
I though we were done
Young love will keep us young
I thought we were done
Young love will keep us young
