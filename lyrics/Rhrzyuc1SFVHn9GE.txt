I understand that you are happy now
But can you tone it down? Oh no
Your pictures kill me with your deadly smile
But can you tone it down? Oh no

I heard you're staying at the centre
No, you ain't sleeping there alone
Then I saw that you were in the Hamptons
Wonder who's there to keep you warm

Where are the sneaky vacations
Google invites applications
Posting it all on your pages
All of it just to enrage me, baby
Oh no, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, all of it just to enrage me, baby

I understand that you are happy now
But can you tone it down? Oh no
Your pictures kill me with your deadly smile
But can you tone it down? Oh no

Wish you could hear these words pouring out my mouth
You got me twisted 'bout you when I know you're proud
I understand that you are happy now
But can you tone it down? Oh

You tryna make a reputation
Nobody thinks you take it slow
We had to have this conversation
Because I think you miss my touch

Where are the sneaky vacations
Google invites applications
Posting it all on your pages
All of it just to enrage me, baby
Oh no, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, all of it just to enrage me, baby

I understand that you are happy now
But can you tone it down? Oh no
Your pictures kill me with your deadly smile
But can you tone it down? Oh no
Wish you could hear these words pouring out my mouth
You got me twisted 'bout you when I know you're proud
I understand that you are happy now
But can you tone it down? Oh

Can you?
Can you tone it down?
Can you?
Can you tone it down?
Can you?
Can you tone it down?
Tone it down

I understand that you are happy now
But can you tone it down? Oh no
Your pictures kill me with your deadly smile
But can you tone it down? Oh no
Wish you could hear these words pouring out my mouth
You got me twisted 'bout you when I know you're proud
I understand that you are happy now
But can you tone it down? Oh
