Summertime was when we met all drunk at that party
she walked away with me that night
since then we hung out daily
we held hands and had some fun but it was ended shortly
when whats-his-name came into place
and you fell for him slowly
She pushed me away ever since that day with him
And i'm at home just sick of s again

Because I need her
but she's already leaving me
and i need her and i need her and i need her bad
but she's already leaving me
but oh well

Crazy how life goes on without me
maybe one day i'll find the one to save me
but can't you be that person to answer me?
but it was all your fault, since you left me

She pushed me away ever since that day with him
And i'm at home just sick of s again
Because I need her
but she's already leaving me
and i need her and i need her and i need her bad
but she's already leaving me
but oh well
