We are murderers
We are murderers
We are murderers
We are murderers

Sing bitter sermons with your name
All the evil to be blame
Save your soul still wanting more
From this glittering life's store
There is something in your mind
Telling you that it's no crime
As long as we go to confession

We are murderers
We are, we are, we all
We are murderers
We are, we are, we all

Bleed our sacred Gods and weep
Evolution into sheep
Living in euphoric sleep
All the toys we so much need
We are playing in our ground
With a solid fence around
So our eyes can't see the horror

We are murderers
We are, we are, we all
We are murderers
We are, we are, we all
We are murderers
We are, we are, we all
We are murderers
We are, we are, we all
We are, we are

The rulers of a burning world
We are, we are
The angels drowning deep into it's
Blood
We are murderers (We are, we are)
We are murderers (We are, we are)
We are murderers (We are, we are)
We are murderers (We are, we are)
We are murderers (We are, we are)
We are, we are, we all
We are murderers (We are, we are)
We are, we are, we all
We are murderers (We are, we are)
We are, we are, we all
We are murderers (We are, we are)
We are, we are, we all
We are, we are
The rulers of a burning world
We are, we are
The angels drowning deep into it's
We are the ones
Turning all the led our gold
There is no chance
No chance of washing
All this blood away
This blood
This blood
