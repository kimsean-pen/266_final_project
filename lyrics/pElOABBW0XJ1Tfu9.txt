I was walking home
Looking at the trees
Got the feeling that they
Were looking back at me

Thoughts that occurred to me
Where not of the usual kind
And I don't take it granted no
I don't call them mine
I don't call them mine
'Cause in my life things
Are built on

Constant surprises
Coming my way
Some call it coincidence
But I like to call it fate

Constant surprises
Coming my way
Some call it coincidence
But I like to call it fate

The higher forces want to connect
Last night in my dream I was talking to you
You know who you are
Were you dreaming too
'Cause in my life
Things are built on
Are built on

Constant surprises
Coming my way
Some call it coincidence
But I like to call it fate

Then on my way home I met this guy
He was not so shy
You know not that kind
We spoke then suddenly I could read his mind
You think it's mad
But I don't fool myself
You think its odd
'Cause in my life
In my life things are built on
They built on
They built on

Constant surprises
Coming my way
Some call it coincidence
But I like to call it fate

Constant surprises
Coming my way
Some call it coincidence
But I like to call it fate.
