Ever since birth
I've been attracted by the sinister
All the malignant, cruel forces of the world
Yet at times I've been mislead by her opposite
And it is with great shame
I acknowledge these mistakes

Father... who art not in heaven
Hear my cries of true remorse
To let a mortal being ever coincide with thou
Must be punished by a fate

Worse than death
I find comfort in sadness and in grief
Thinking of all those beautiful things that
Could have been
Now put me in a position
where i would have to choose
My devotion to evil
Will always come before you

For countless days and countless nights
I've been wandering
These worn-down streets all alone
And it is in there angstridden moments
I find nutrition for my starving

Misanthropic soul
(Solo)
I find comfort in sadness and in grief
Thinking of all those beautiful things that Could have been
Now put me in a position where i would Have to choose
My devotion to evil
Will always come before you
No matter what you do
No matter what you say
Whoever you may pray
Christianity a worldwide
Satanas worldwide
