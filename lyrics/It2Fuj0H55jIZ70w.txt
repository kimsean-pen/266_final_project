She was his
She would take his children
Black and white
Right to her own breast
There were times
When he could mix
With ordinary white company
Though? the subject never came up
No one would notice
He had what they call passing complexion
He had what they call passing complexion
He had what they call passing complexion
He had what they call passing complexion
He'd been white, he'd been black
They asked him, black like that?
Yeah!
