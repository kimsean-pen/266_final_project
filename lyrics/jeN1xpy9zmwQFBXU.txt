There's something about you that keeps me tied
It happened too fast to understand
Believing in what you say to pass the time
I wonder if you ever picture me instead

I will stick to your heart
I won't give you up
I will stick to your heart
I won't give you up

You give it to me time and time again
Your secret warmth it's only mine
If you treat me right then we could start to fade
The line where you and I begin

I will stick to your heart
I won't give you up
I will stick to your heart
I won't give you up
I will stick to your heart
But I won't give you up
I will stick to your heart
Bet I won't give you up

I will stick to your heart
I won't give you up
I will stick to your heart
And I won't give you up
I will stick to your heart
And I won't give you up
I will stick to your heart
But I won't give you up
I will stick to your heart
And I won't give you up
