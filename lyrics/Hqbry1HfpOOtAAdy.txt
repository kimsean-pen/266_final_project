There's a storm across the valley
Clouds are rolling in
The afternoon is heavy
On your shoulders
There's a truck out on the four lane
A mile or more away
The whining of his wheels
Just makes it colder

He's an hour away from riding
On your prayers up in the sky
And ten days on the road
Are barely gone
There's a fire softly burning
Supper's on the stove
It's the light in your eyes
That makes him warm

Hey it's good to be back home again

Sometimes this old farm
Feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey it's good to be back home again
There's all the news to tell him

How you've spent your time
What's the latest thing the neighbors say
And your mother called last Friday
Sunshine made her cry
You felt the baby move just yesterday
Hey it's good to be back home again

Yes it is
Sometimes this old farm

Feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey it's good to be back home again
And all the time that I can lay this tired old body down
To feel your fingers feather soft upon me
The kisses that I live for

The love that lights my way
The happiness that living with you brings me
It's the sweetest thing i know of
Just spending time with you
It's the little things that make a house a home

Like a fire softly burning, supper on the stove
It's the light in your eyes that makes me warm
Hey it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm
Feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey it's good to be back home again
Hey it's good to be back home again
You know it is
Sometimes this old farm
Feels like a long lost friend
Hey it's good to be back home again
I said hey it's good to be back home again...
