A crooked arrow and a broken heart
We stick together chasing hurricanes
You got the healing, got the wicked spark
And I don't even know your name, I don't even know your name

A sugar bullet and a loaded gun
We keep on low just to get the high
Your light is brighter than a thousand suns
And I don't even know your name, I don't even know your name

And we can just ride, ride, ride
You can be the highway, I will be your sunset
And we ride, ride, ride
You feel like the moonlight, I can be your summer night
And we ride, and we ride
You can be the highway, I will be your sunset
And we ride

Bear feet on the dashboard
Raise your hands to the universe
No matter what you can call me home
And I don't even know your name

And we can just ride, ride, ride
You can be the highway, I will be your sunset
And we ride, ride, ride
You feel like the moonlight, I can be your summer night
And we ride, and we ride
You can be the highway, I will be your sunset
And we ride

Don't wanna know where you're coming from
Or how to find where you want to go
No matter what you can call me home
And I don't need to know your name

And we can just ride, ride, ride
You can be the highway, I will be your sunset
And we ride, ride, ride
You feel like the moonlight, I can be your summer night
And we ride, and we ride
You can be the highway, I will be your sunset
And we ride

You can be the highway, I will be your sunset
And we ride
