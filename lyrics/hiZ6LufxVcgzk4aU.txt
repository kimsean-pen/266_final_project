I never saw your face
But I can tell you're there
And waiting at the Right Hand

Satan laughs
But I can swear I hear all
The saints on their way down

Here come the Shirts in Brown and Black
With the flashing lights
They're hiding
In different colors in the dead of night
They're running Waller County, Texas where 4, 000 died
And down in Jackson, Mississippi they don't have to hide

But innocence is alive
And it's coming back one day
Oh, yes it is

Here come them boys in black and white
With the kerosene
It's been the same evil power since in '63
They hang in Homewood, Alabama with the whitest sheets
And in Montgomery County, Maryland from a sapling tree

But innocence is alive
And it's coming back one day

I don't think you're gonna get away
With the Seal I can hear them singing
Kindra Chapman (we're coming back)
And brother Andre Jones (we're coming back) we're coming back
Lennon Lacy (we're coming back) I can here him
Sandra Bland (we're coming back) we're coming back
And Roosevelt Pernell (we're coming back)
Keith Warren (we're coming back)
Alfred Wright (we're coming back)
We're coming back and any day now, it won't be long

The hand that brings the gavel down
Is the hand that ties the noose
The hand that finds you behind
And ties the thirteen loops

But that hand is gonna fold
The day is coming soon
When we fill it full of dust
And resurrect the truth

But innocence is alive
And it's coming back one day
Oh, yes it is, yes it is
