See the signs adorning the sky
With fear in your eyes
In hope up the sunrise

Hearts beat fast as the moon turns black
And the trees catch fire from the bleeding sky
Stars are fading and the sun won't show
All their hearts are bleeding as the moon turns black

To the edge
To the moon
We will be swept away
It's the end, the end, the end
Hear them cry out to the moon
Oh will the earth abide?
It's the end, the end, the end
It's the end, the end, the end
It's the end, the end, the end

End it may
With ice or in flames
Your tears will dry
In hope of the divine

Hearts beat fast
Moon turns black
Hearts beat fast
Moon turns black

To the edge
To the moon
We will be swept away
It's the end, the end, the end
Hear them cry out to the moon
Oh will the earth abide?
It's the end, the end, the end
It's the end, the end, the end
It's the end, the end, the end

To the edge
To the moon
We will be swept away
It's the end, the end, the end
Hear them cry out to the moon
Oh will the earth abide?
It's the end, the end, the end
Oh is it the end?
Oh is it the end?
