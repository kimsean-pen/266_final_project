Please, don't talk about me
With all your friends

Stuff that big, bottomless cup in my hand (I'll never leave you)
Fill up this riddle with curses, old man (so easy to say)
Acting like enemies out of my way (I never loved you)
Still won't break up with the things I have made (stay the hell out of my way)

Sick of being on my game
And understated
Wanna throw it all away
And open up with something new
Taken all that I can take
I'm gonna make it
Wanna throw it all away
And open up with something new
Brand new

That's it, it's over, I'm done
Give me the keys to the car
I'll put the pedal to the metal
As you're falling apart
And I don't wanna see the phony look on your face
I should have never fallen for it in the first place
Touch me, fool me
Tame me, make me
All about it

Then I bleed, you scream
Shame me, I'll leave
Over dramatic

Nah, I don't do that anymore
No people, just places I adore
Too fed, I lost the feeling
Leave it alone, I'm asleep so I'm healing

All great things have battle scars
You wanna swap this belief with a greater art?
My flesh road has only grow into a mattress fit for mounting

Stuff that big, bottomless cup in my hand (I'll never leave you)
Fill up this riddle with curses, old man (so easy to say)
Acting like enemies out of my way (I never loved you)
Still won't break up with the things I have made (stay the hell out of my way)

Sick of being on my game
And understated
Wanna throw it all away
And open up with something new
Taken all that I can take
I'm gonna make it
Wanna throw it all away
And open up with something new
Brand new

I've faced this allergy, It won't go away
Upgraded salary, employment virus aid
I've faced this allergy
It's everything I thought that I could fake

I'll live in the moment
You gave me a reason
Then I fell asleep in the bathroom
Mixing magic potions
Looking for a meaning
To get myself out of this costume

Sick and tired of counting
Bubbles in the ceiling
Feel like a prisoner in my head
I was only trying
To forget the feeling
I get when I think of you
Beautiful and tragic
Beautiful and tragic

I see me riding off, off through the clouds (beautiful and tragic)
I see me riding off, off through the bitter end
I see me riding off, off through the clouds (beautiful and tragic)
I see me reriting off, off all my bitter ends (I'm so sick)

Sick of being on my game
And understated
Wanna throw it all away
And open up with something new
Taken all that I can take
I'm gonna make it
Wanna throw it all away
And open up with something new
Brand new
