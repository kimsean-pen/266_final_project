drops

give up, let down
can't believe what i found
(keep quiet, be silent, these words from your mouth)
build up from ground
wipe clean of your frowns
(turn around before we run aground)

one more wrong
costs you all
sticks like glue
obstructs my view

speak up, adapt
watch closely, keep track
(streamlined, live by the rules applied)
thin line to walk, no time to stop
(this life your glorify a waste of time)
give up, let down
can't believe what i found
(keep quiet, be silent, these words from your mouth)
build up from ground
wipe clean of your frowns
(turn around before we run aground)

one more fault
costs you all

until i'm through
