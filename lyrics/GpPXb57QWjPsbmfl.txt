Too good to be true our worlds collide
Now I understand why
Its been so long on the other side
Feel my heart was gonna die
So look straight into my eyes
Tell me the truth and not lies
Put your hands up testify

And my heart will come alive
And my heart will come alive
And my heart will come alive

Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoooooa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa

Too good to be true our worlds collide
Now I understand why
Its been so long on the other side
Feel my heart was gonna die
So look straight into my eyes
Tell me the truth and not lies
Put your hands up testify

And my heart will come alive
And my heart will come alive
And my heart will come alive

And my heart will come alive
