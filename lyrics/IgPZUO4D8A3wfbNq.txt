When I find myself alone
i think of you on your own
in silence staring at the sun
i thought our love had just begun
but then i find myself inside
your broken heart it's open, open wide

when was love ever mentioned
you say to me now
this was not my intention

Every night i lie awake
i can feel my heart break
but then i lie and close my eyes
we are together now
heartbreak

my dreams are lost and full of hope
they take me all around the globe
i dream of dying every night
my heart it aches for you

but then I save you
then I find my self inside
your broken heart it's open, open wide

when was love ever mentioned
you say to me now
this was not my intention

Every night i lie awake
i can feel my heart break
but then i lie and close my eyes
we are together now
heartbreak

Every night i lie awake
i can feel my heart break
then i lie and close my eyes
we are together now
heartbreak

Heartbreak

Every night i lie awake
i can feel my heart break
but then i lie and close my eyes
we are together now
