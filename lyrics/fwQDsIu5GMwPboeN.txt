Baby, I used to watch your flowers grow
Now it's raining and all your petals turns to stone
I've been praying, I turn around and see my rose
But you faded, you let me down
Now it's time to go

That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You left me to late our time is done
That's why I'm long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
ou left me to late our time is done

Baby, I think you've got your timing wrong
Hating, exploring this high we're riding on
And it's crazy to think that I could be reborn
If you saved me but
Now it's too late and we'll never know
You're like a diamond and I'm like glass
Like oil and water we always clash
Sometimes my confessions are hard for me
I'll tell you now I'm setting you free

That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You left me to late our time is done
That's why I'm long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You left me to late our time is done

With broken wings
I can't fly
Girl I need you to save me, angel of mine

With broken wings
(With broken wings)
I can't fly
(I can't fly)
Girl I need you to save me, angel of mine

With broken wings
(With broken wings)
I can't fly
(I can't fly)
Girl I need you to save me, angel of mine

With broken wings
I can't fly
Girl I need you to save me

That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me fly alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You left me to late our time is done
That's why I'm long gone
You need to let me die alone
That's why I'm long gone, long gone
You need to let me die alone
With broken wings
I can't fly
