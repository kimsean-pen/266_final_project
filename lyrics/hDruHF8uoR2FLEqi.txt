you dip your hands into my flesh
and say you won't reveal a scar
I must have faith in this procedure
it's a miracle, it's a wonder
a thousand hidden needles
in a thousand covered nerves
stick pins in my receptacles
look to your voodoo doll, your mojo
staying alive at five
for you to cure my ailments
another soul is saved
with your bogus medications
what color shall we have today?
depends on how I feel you say
consult your research on the media
see blue, will calm my hysteria
staying alive at five
for you to cure my ailments
another soul is saved
with your bogus medications
staying alive at five
with your empty containers
another corpse ornaments your waiting room
a placebo effect reversed
a placebo effect
a placebo effect
will you ever ever regret the placebo effect?
can you ever ever forget the placebo effect?
oh, oh
oh oh oh oh oh
oh, oh...
