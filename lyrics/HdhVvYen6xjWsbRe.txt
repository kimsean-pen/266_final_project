I'm alone, I'm a broken home
I gave you all the bricks that I own
And no, I'm letting go
I'm breaking these walls down, breaking these walls down

If you wanna adventure then flutter home
But if you wanna travel, then go alone
Yeah, what's the point in us if I'll never know
Yeah, if you're gonna leave then I'mma let you go

Go away, I'm tired of the pain
Go away, I'm done with yesterday
(Flutter, flutter)

I fell, where my demons dwell
My own, it's a nightmare, I call it hell
Oh well, time to get back up
Climbing and climbing, I'm done with this ride
Is what I tell myself, so I can feel something else
Yeah I guess I had my bad days, but it doesn't mean I lost myself

Darling where were you, when my heart was on the ground
I thought time would prove, that you would stick around
I guess time stands still, a king without his crown
Now I'm breaking, and you're faking, girl
You never made a sound

Go away, I'm tired of the pain
Go away, I'm done with yesterday
(Flutter, flutter)

If you wanna adventure than flutter home
But if you wanna travel, then go alone
Yeah, what's the point in us if I'll never know
Yeah, if you're gonna leave then I'm gonna let you go
If you wanna adventure than flutter home
But if you wanna travel, then go alone
Yeah, what's the point in us if I'll never know
Yeah, if you're gonna leave then I'm gonna let you go
