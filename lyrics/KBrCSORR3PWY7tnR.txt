I will take all the violence
I will take all the pain
You can have all the sunshine
Keep it all out the way
I could survive on nothing
Carrying all the blame
Make me believe I'm worthless
Make me feel like a slave

Bring your anchors and do whatever you can
To get under my skin
Learn to change your shape
And then you tell me again
That it's all in my head

Cover up information
Bury my given name
All with good intentions
Only a false trade
Build a world around me
Tell me that I am safe
Defense is necessary
It's keeping me from running away

Bring your anchors and do whatever you can
To get under my skin
Learn to change your shape
And then you tell me again
That it's all in my head
Bring your anchors and do whatever you can
To get under my skin
Learn to change your shape
And then you tell me again
That it's all in my head

Learn to change your face
And then you tell us again
That it's all in our heads

It's all in our heads
It's all in our heads
