Sailing silver waves
Through the skies and 'round your eyes
And in the pockets of the tide
A meeting place by night

Sequin covered swans
They're used to make their own mosaics
A ceremony comes
An exponential fate

The dance of the cosmos shows
The stitches of space that slowly come and go
The dance of the cosmos shows
As above, so below

A whippowil in flight
Turns east towards Westphalia
In search of lost time
With the magic of true light

Tone zodiac in tune
With the fossil of our theme park
And falling from the seams
Sees the steeple, swarm delight

The dance of the cosmos shows
The stitches of space that slowly come and go
The dance of the cosmos shows
As above, so below

The dance of the cosmos shows
The stitches of space that slowly come and go
The dance of the cosmos shows
As above, so below

Galloping, galloping, beams faster
Galloping, galloping, beams faster
Galloping, galloping, beams faster

Joining together and still faster
Joining together and still faster
Joining together and still faster
Joining together and still faster
Onwards past, never and still faster

The dance of the cosmos shows
The stitches of space that slowly come and go
The dance of the cosmos shows
As above, so below

The dance of the cosmos shows
The stitches of space that slowly come and go
The dance of the cosmos shows
As above, so below
