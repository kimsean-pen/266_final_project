When the world has gone mad
And there's nowhere to roam
The lights are all on but nobody's home
There comes a time
When you look up to the sky
And ask why do my favorite songs always make me cry
And am I losing

My sanity, my sanity
I've nothing to lose, so please let me be
I've got a firm grip and strong roots like a tree
Burrowed deep in reality
I won't let you go, what else can there be
You're all I have

When you swore to be true
Our bed was belief
But alternative facts snuck in like a thief
There comes a time to release the cord of self
And with confidence declare your state of perfect mental health
Never doubting

My sanity, my sanity
I've nothing to lose, so please let me be
My life is a song, a short melody
Harmonizing with reality
I've got it real bad, there's no remedy
You're all I have, my dear sanity

Sometimes there's no sane reason for optimism

Oh my sanity, my sanity
I've nothing to lose, so please let me be
My life is a song, a short melody
Harmonizing with reality
I've got it real bad, there's no remedy
My world picture is exemplary
I won't let you go, what else can there be
You're all I have, my dear sanity
