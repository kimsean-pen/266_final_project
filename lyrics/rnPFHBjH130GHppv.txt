Where are you tonight
I couldn't say goodbye
Your words still echo in my mind
The stars fall down lighting up the sky
If I had one more chance I would have done it right

The sky falls down at your command
The city will roar with the sound of terror
And our world will crumble
At the sound of your voice
So take my words, it's not my choice

There's no looking back
Live for right now
I'm so far away, so far away
With no difference between right or wrong
I'm so far away, so far from you

The sky falls down with a single glance
From your eyes, we walk as strangers in these times
All of what we know is about to end
We'll keep on fighting, but we'll never win

There's no looking back
Live for right now
I'm so far away, so far away
With no difference between right or wrong
I'm so far away, so far from you

Goodbye
Goodbye

So far away, so far away

There's no looking back
Live for right now
I'm so far away, so far away
With no difference between right or wrong
I'm so far away, so far from you

Goodbye
