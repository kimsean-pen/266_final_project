As leaves fleeting fall from above
Under skies ever here
Darkness comes to the door
Table place set before its honored seat
The chase has come and gone
Yearning to be let go
Colors in the mirror
Better still, to inform
Skies ever here
Been this way throughout time
Been this way throughout my life
Your heart brings me home
Been this way throughout time
From the tumult of the heave
Not born of belief
Your heart brings me home

As seasons come here to rest
Lilting rays aglow
Obsidian flow
Fire hewn within the stone
Life that has come before
Looming fears of the wilt
Shadows at the door
Colors in the mirror
Been this way throughout time
Been this way throughout my life
Your heart brings me home
Been this way throughout my life
From the tumult of the heave
Not born of belief
Our nature redeemed
Unburden our grief
Your heart brings me home
Lifting off, renewed
Astral form in flight
Enthrall every hue
Unknown to our eyes
Every cell of being
Outside of mind
Mantra not apart
From ineffable heart
Endless worlds in endless mind
Caught in dreams of our own design
Dressed and groomed tradition dead
All around you the infinite
Seeing
Beauty in falling leaves
