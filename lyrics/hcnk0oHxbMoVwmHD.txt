What's she got that I don't have?
Does she fill those spaces that I left you?
When you wake up every night, does the scent of regret ever haunt you?
Put this under your skin!

Cause I am me, and I won't change for anyone
Me and I won't change for anyone
For anyone like you
Does the weight of consequence drag you down until it pulls you under?

(Pulls you under)
Does she lend an eager hand to save you from the future of being with her?
Are you with her?
Put this under her skin!
Cause I am me, and I won't change for anyone

Me and I won't change for anyone
For anyone like you
Why would I, why would I change?
Why would I change?

Put this under your skin!
Cause I am me, and I won't change for anyone

Me and I won't change, I won't change!
What's she got that I don't have?
What's she got that I don't have?
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
