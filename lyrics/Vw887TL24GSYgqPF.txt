Even though the words were spoken in whispers
They were loud and they were clear
From the kitchen steps, through the ceiling vents
So careless and cavalier
I swear to god I never meant for this
But I'm crippled with resentment
And if I could speak I would ask one thing
You wouldn't bother answering
How could you do this to me?

I'll hide behind nightmares and blank stares
While you justify your treason
You had me in your crosshairs

Don't act surprised to see the knife in your spine
With your initials etched in the handle
I guess what comes around, comes around
I guess what goes around, comes around

I've been grasping onto pages
From the book that you burned ages ago
Just a glimpse at the bigger picture
What else could be left to show?

How could you do this to me?
I'll hide behind nightmares and blank stares
While you justify your treason

From the driver seat of a Cherokee, I can finally see
From the kitchen steps, through the ceiling vents
Clarity, clarity

I'll hide behind nightmares and blank stares
While you justify your treason
You had me in your crosshairs
