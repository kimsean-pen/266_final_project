Oh, the price that we pay
For the lives we betrayed
Only washes away
When we turn to stardust

This moment in time
My life will collide
Born from the sky
This world demands life

The life that we seek
The life that we seek
The life that we seek
The life that we seek

Floating in silence
The price we pay
Begins with boundless pain
Awaken, only to die
For a new life

I can hear them scream
I can see them bleed
I can hear them scream
I can see them bleed
