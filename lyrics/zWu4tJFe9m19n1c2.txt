The city underneath
That passes by
The city on top of the world
Is the victim to
Whatever we do

Everywhere we turn away
To find another reason
To never return
As were passing through
The city we view

Way down
Way down
Way down
Way down

They wake you
They sit in the streets
And wave at you
The city beneath
Away from you
They sit in the streets
And wave at you
The city beneath
And there the same as
I'm the same as you

Everywhere I look
The people stare in the direction
That they're headed for
In herds that they move
Through streets under you

If they ever find
A way to exist
Without pushing themselves to a war
Until' all that they lose
Can't ever be used

Way down
Way down
Way down
Way down

They wake you
They sit in the streets
And wave at you
The city beneath
Away from you
They sit in the streets
And wave at you
The city beneath
And there the same as
I'm the same as you

They sit in the streets
And wave at you
The city beneath
Away from you
They sit in the streets
And wave at you
They wave at you
They wave at you
They wave at you

They sit in the streets
And wave at you
The city beneath
Away from you
They sit in the streets
And wave at you
The city beneath
And there the same as
I'm the same as
There the same as
I'm the same as you
