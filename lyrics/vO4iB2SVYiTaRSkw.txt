I used to be scared of death,
But now its my only friend.
I found comfort in it's embrace
And solace in the grace that it leaves me each night.
I am no longer afraid to die because my world's become so empty
You were so young, I owe this all to you.
You live in my every word, you're the reason that i'm still alive
No one deserves to die, I never got to say goodbye.
So this is my goodbye to you,
And I hope wherever you are,
That you hear how my voice sounds now,
How in six years I haven't drowned,
In the shadow that I have become,
In the shadow of my everyday,
In the darkness that I have become,
In the shadow of my everyday
And I still miss you,
You were the place that I called home,
And I am so alone.
