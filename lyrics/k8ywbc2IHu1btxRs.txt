I took the Polaroid down in my room
I'm pretty sure you have a new girlfriend
It's not as if i don't like you
It just makes me sad whenever i see it

'cause i like to be gone most of the time
And you like to be home most of the time
If i stay in one place i lose my mind
I'm a pretty impossible lady to be with

Joey never met a bike that he didn't wanna ride
And i never met a Toby that i didn't like
Scotty liked all of the books that i recommended
Even if he didn't i wouldn't be offended

I had a dream that i had to drive to Madison
To deliver a painting for some silly reason
I took a wrong turn and ended up in Michigan
Paul Baribeau took me to the giant tire swing

Gave me a push and he started singing
I sang along while i was swinging
The sound of our voices made us forget everything
That had ever hurt our feelings

Joey never met a bike that he didn't wanna ride
And i never met a Toby that i didn't like
Scotty liked all of the books that i recommended
Even if he didn't i wouldn't be offended
(Wouldn't be offended)

Now i'm home for less than twenty-four hours
That's hardly time to take a shower
Hug my family and take your picture off the wall

Check my email write a song and make a few phone calls
Before it's time to leave again
I've got one hand on the steering wheel
One waving out the window
If i'm a spinster for the rest of my life
My arms will keep me warm on cold and lonely nights

Joey never met a bike that he didn't wanna ride
And i never met a Toby that i didn't like
Scotty liked all of the books that i recommended
Even if he didn't i wouldn't be offended.
