This door has been shut for days
And it's all too familiar
Can't I just crack a window
Can't I just shake it off?

I'm sure I've tasted this before, before, before
I'm sure I've tasted this before

Everything is out of reach
And I just want to see outside
The air, the air has been getting thin
I feel like cutting it open tonight, tonight, yeah
And falling on the floor

There's nothing left unused in here
There's nothing left to say

I haven't talked in days
And I'm really not too sure
What I sound like anymore
My vision has gone and my mouth is full of sores, of sores

I feel like dripping it dry tonight, yeah
For over and over again
It's time, it's time to open up the door, the door
