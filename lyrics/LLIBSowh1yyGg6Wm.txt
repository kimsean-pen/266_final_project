Great manipulator
Fold your wings
Condescend to me
In back alley streets
Where broken words stretch endlessly

Where a moment steals destiny
Unravel me

Where pain is measured
In the depth of a scream
The redder the blood
The more sacred the belief
To become lost the more you seek

How could I capture my being?
A flash of a moment
A chemical decree
Where emotion cloaks meaning
Can you trace the edges of a dream?
A formless memory?

Confusion crowned king
Communication comes
Sputtering
Dog-mouthed ravings
Silent razor
Spilling me

Spent breath
And echo of death
Labyrinthine, do you know me?

The million-tongued beast
With a vile answer
To every morbid inquiry
A hydra head upon the neck
Of every dead-end street
A tragic circle
Of every linearity
Each word of hope
Can only spell defeat

The Tyrant comes crawling
Calling, internally
To make me adversary
To kill the God in me
