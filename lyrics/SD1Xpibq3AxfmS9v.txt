Hey, hey, they live this day and night
This is sacrifice, no fucking compromise
Hey, hey, they have the heart to resist
While the hunters hunt, they will persist

This is where tragedy is bought and sold
It seems their pain is worth its weight in gold
You know they're here when the water is red
Our fading life support is hanging by a thread
A message etched on broken ships

Hey, hey, they live this day and night
This is sacrifice, no fucking compromise
Hey, hey, they have the heart to resist
While the hunters hunt, they will persist

And you can hear them cry, they're calling out
To the mother lost, she's bleeding out
She's bleeding out
Their innocence is heaven sent
Their malevolence, it will not relent
A graveyard sits upon the shore
They won't swim together anymore

The tide will rush with waves of fear
Selling souls, the Devil is near
The tide will rush in waves of fear
Selling souls, the Devil is near
The Devil is near

If we're gonna survive on this planet, we have to respect the rights
Of all those species to survive 'cause we need them more than they need us

A message etched on broken ships
We'll be here till corruption quits
There is a voice, though they cannot speak
Not yet ready to admit defeat
You can hear them cry, they're calling out
To the mother lost, she's bleeding out
You can hear them cry, they're calling out
To the mother lost, she's bleeding out
Their tragedy is bought and sold
It seems their pain is worth its weight in gold
