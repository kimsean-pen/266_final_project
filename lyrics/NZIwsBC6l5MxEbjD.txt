I don't need you to save me
I don't need you to cure me
I don't need you
And your antidote
For I am my disease
I don't need you to free me
I don't need you to help me
I don't need you
To lead me through the light
For I will always fall
And rise again
Your venomous howling
'Cause I'm a survivor
Yeah I am a fighter
I will fall and rise above
And in your hate I find love
'Cause I'm a survivor
Yeah I am a fighter
I will not hide my face
I will not fall from grace
I walk into the fire, baby
All my life I was afraid to die
But now I come alive inside these flames
You don't want me to love you
You don't want me to need you
You don't want to look at me
For you will turn to stone
You don't want me to hurt you
You don't want me to bite you
You don't want me
Or my aching soul
For I will only fall
And rise again
Your venomous howling
I'm a survivor
Yeah I am a fighter
I will fall and rise above
And in your hate I find love
'Cause I'm a survivor
Yeah I am a fighter
I will not hide my face
I will not fall from grace
I walk into the fire, baby
All my life I was afraid to die
But now I come alive inside these flames

(...)
I don't need you to save me

'Cause I'm a survivor

Yeah I am a fighter
I will not hide my face
I will not fall from grace
I walk into the fire, baby
All my life I was afraid to die
But now I come alive inside these
Alive inside these
Alive inside these flames
