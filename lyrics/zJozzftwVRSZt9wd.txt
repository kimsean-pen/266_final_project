I didn't mean to hurt you when I hurt myself
It's just an empty lie screaming out for help
No, I didn't mean to scare you
But I couldn't see that when I went to hell
I was taking you with me
When I close my eyes
I'm climbing in the dark
Trying not to fall apart
Sometimes I get so high
Falling is the only out I see
And I don't wanna take you down with me

Take you down
Take you down with me
(Don't wanna take you down, take you down)
Take you
Down with me
(Down with me)
(Down with me)
(Take you down)

This life is like a race and
When it cuts I bleed
But it's in my hand
And I'm doing it to me
Sometimes it's like an ocean
And it gets too deep
There's no way that now you could rescue me

When I close my eyes
I'm fighting in the dark
Trying not to break your heart
Sometimes I get so high
Falling is the only out I see
And I don't wanna take you down with me

You need to let it go now
Before you drown

I know that you won't understand
You need to let go of these hands
Cause I'm going now
And I don't wanna take you down with me
(And I don't wanna take you down with me)
Take you down, down with me
