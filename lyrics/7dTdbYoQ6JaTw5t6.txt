Till we get it right baby, yeah
Mix it up till we get it right, yeah
If anything stay in your lane, you in my city now
Put diamonds on me and my ridas on me
Came like Lebron, only trill niggas doing this shit
Ridin' on 'em never dyin' on em
Man you can't tell me a motherfuckin' thing, bruh
Yah

Triple threat, triple wreck the bed
Left it drippin' wet, drippin' wet
Whip that chicken wet, I just trip with that
Trip with that bitch I'm whipping wet, put that on the set
On the set, I iced up the set, put that on my neck

On my neck, stay in your lane, this game will lay you down
Bring the day, last night was safe, til' they Mercedes down
Pinky rang, iced out my chain
These hoes can't play me now
Really think there's no mistake till they Mercedes now

Dumb down nigga I'm here for the sex, I must confess
Hit your hope and left that shit drippin' wet, I must confess
Fuck this rap shit I'm just here for the check, I must confess
Popo throw the hundred years on the desk, I won't confess

Bro my dope it smoke like ain't no tomorrow, yo that's my motto
Fuck your homies make you po' out the bottle, bitch I'm a rider
Bro my dope it smoke like ain't no tomorrow, yo that's my motto
Fuck your homies make you po' out the bottle, bitch I'm a rider

Triple threat, checked them with the TEC
Left 'em drippin' wet, triple threat, she a triple threat
Booty pussy neck, pussy neck paint this pussy wet
Guess who pushin' that, pushin' that, I crossed out the set
Left 'em drippin' wet, drippin' wet

Stay in your lane, this game will lay you down
Really think, no wedding ring, ten different ladies now
What you claim, I bang the same, we straight gang gangin' now
Package cain, hard white cocaine, I'm whippin' babies now

Double bitch I'm just here for the sex, I must confess
Hit your hope and left that shit drippin' wet, I must confess
Fuck this rap shit I'm just here for the check, I must confess
Popo throw the hundred years on the desk, I won't confess
Bro my dope it smoke like ain't no tomorrow, yo that's my motto

Fuck your homies make you po' out the bottle, bitch I'm a rider
Bro my dope it smoke like ain't no tomorrow, yo that's my motto
Fuck your homies make you po' out the bottle, bitch I'm a rider

My diamonds on me and my ridas on me, yeah yeah
Ridin' on 'em never dyin' on em, yeah
My diamonds on me and my ridas on me
Ridin' on 'em never dyin' on em, yeah
