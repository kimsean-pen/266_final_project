Well, every road I see leads away from me
There's not a single one that leads me home
All the roads keep saying, "Friend, come see what's 'round the bend"
So is it any wonder that I roam

All the places I have been keep a-callin' me back again
Down in the pines I hear the cold wind blow
My heart keeps tellin' me, footloose and fancy free
But the road goes by and calls me as it goes

Well, maybe somewhere there's a someone waitin' there with a smile
And maybe there'll be someplace I can stop and rest a while
'Cause maybe you weren't meant to be just a rollin' stone
And there's a road to travel on that leads you back to home

Oh, but I'll keep travelin' on, keep a-lookin' at the dawn
Till I can lay this lonesome body down
And when that day has come, I never more will roam
And every road I see will lead me home
And when that day has come, I never more will roam
And every road I see will lead me home
