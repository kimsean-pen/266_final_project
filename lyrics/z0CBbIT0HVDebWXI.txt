Well, I didn't see it coming and you always kept me running
At the rough times, which were all the time
And I didn't know your name when I saw you in the rain
On a cold night, which was every night
Was it easy for you? 'Cause it ain't been for me
And lately, well, I've been lonely
And time moves slow everywhere that I go
Because, Penelope, you were my energy
I kind of miss you in a way, but I can't say

I guess I'm laidback about your love
I guess I'm laidback about your love
I'm pretty crazy about your love
I guess I'm laidback about your love
I guess I'm laidback about your love
I'm pretty crazy without your love

You were always looking stunning, I was too busy bunning
To take notice, I hope you know this
Delete the pictures off my phone, watching TV on my own
Like a lowlife, I guess you were right
And every single day, everybody seems to say
"Are you alright, mate?" when I'm not, mate
I'm getting pretty good at lying and my chores are multiplying
'Cause, Penelope, you're now my enemy
I kind of miss you in a way, but I can't say

I guess I'm laidback about your love
I guess I'm laidback about your love
I'm pretty crazy about your love
I guess I'm laidback about your love
I guess I'm laidback about your love
I'm pretty crazy without your love

Guess I'm laidback, guess it should be my middle name
Well, I can't go back, I've only got myself to blame
Guess I'm laidback
Well, I guess I'm laidback
I kind of miss you in a way, but I can't say

I guess I'm laidback about your love
I guess I'm laidback about your love
I'm pretty crazy about your love
I guess I'm laidback about your love
I guess I'm laidback about your love
I'm pretty crazy without your love

Guess I'm laidback, guess it should be my middle name
Guess I'm laidback
Well, I guess I'm laidback
Yes, I'm laidback
Well, I guess I'm laidback
