This isn't goodbye
I just need a little time to hide
We're forever you and I
And you know it

Wouldn't give it all away
'Cause we weathered that
Storm and the pouring rain
When I need a little love
You show it

And nothing beats that high
But coming down from you
Well it takes just a little time
So I put it in writing

This is au revoir, I won't go that far
You'll still see me, you'll still hear me
Love you dearly, ahh
And this is not the end, I'll come back again
You'll still see me, you'll still hear me
Love you dearly, yours sincerely

Ah ah, ah ah ah ah
Ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah ah ah
Ah ah

Every little word
Every dance I do when I'm shaking it for you
Even when it hurts
There's nothing on earth I wouldn't do for you

'Cause nothing beats that high
But coming down from you
Well it takes just a little time
So I put it in writing

This is au revoir, I won't go that far
You'll still see me, you'll still hear me
Love you dearly, ahh
And this is not the end, I'll come back again
You'll still see me, you'll still hear me
Love you dearly, yours sincerely

Ah ah, ah ah ah ah
Ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah ah ah
Ah ah

Give me those thrills, I won't forget you
Put it all down in a love letter
Love letter
Love letter
Give me those thrills, I won't forget ya
Put it all down in a love letter
(Sincerely yours) Love letter
So I put it in writing (put it in writing)

This is au revoir, I won't go that far
You'll still see me, you'll still hear me
Love you dearly, ahh
And this is not the end, I'll come back again
You'll still see me, you'll still hear me
Love you dearly, yours sincerely

Ah ah, ah ah ah ah
Ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah ah ah
Ah ah

Give me those thrills, I won't forget you
Put it all down in a love letter
Love letter
Sincerely yours
