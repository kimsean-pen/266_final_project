I'm incognito
like a shadow that moves through the night
you sit by your window and wait
And I can see you as the moon hits your eyes
Its my guide

Shinning to show me the way
Shinning to show me the way

You got me walking through the bushes baby
Your bodys like a charm
Oh Ooh

Your silhouette that gets me

Yeah this darkness turns me
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Kiss Me, Kill Me,
Nobodys gunna see you touch me feel me

You got me walking through the bushes baby
Sneak out the back
Al have you back
Before he knows your gone

I feel the freedom as we just left the bright city lights
The skys filled with stars From the rain

For the moment when you see your dreams come alive
I know that well never be safe

As the sun comes to take you away

You got me walking through the bushes baby
Your bodys like a charm
Oh Ooh

Your silhouette that gets me

Yeah this darkness turns me
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Kiss Me, Kill Me,
Nobodys gunna see you touch me, feel me

You got me walking through the bushes baby
Sneak out the back
Al have you back
Before he knows your gone
Before he knows your gone
Before he knows your gone
Before he knows, he knows, he knows

You got me walking through the bushes baby
Your bodys like a charm
Oh Ooh

Your silhouette that gets me

Yeah this darkness turns me
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Kiss Me, Kill Me,
Nobodys gunna see you touch me, feel me

You got me walking through the bushes baby
Sneak out the back
Al have you back
Before he knows your gone
