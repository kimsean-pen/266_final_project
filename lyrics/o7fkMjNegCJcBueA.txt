Burned at the stake for the
Accusation of heresy
Endless torture till victims
Developed stories
Undeserving sentencing out of
Religious animosity
Christian ethnography of killing
The false accused
A religion based on the murder of heretics
The name of Christ used as a tool of death
History tied into endless violence
Hate and war based on
The creed of the church
Heretics nailed to a crucifix
Blood of Christ a staple of death
Religious fraud rhetoric of the pope
Lies and murder for profit
