In the hearts of men
In the arms of mothers
In the part we play
To convinve others

We know what we're doing
We're doing it right
They've written books on the subject
But then you may still feel surprised
By your tone over the phone
To your sister while waiting in line
At the shopping mart
Outside of town

In the hands of teachers
In the books you read
In the things we say
When we lost the lead
I still try to speak up
But my voice won't make a sound

And I thought it all over
Too many times
When there is no use
And the lights are all out
I just give it up and I walk home
Past the shopping mart that's just closing down

You tell yourself you are, must be what you be
Who's to say who is who and what is what
If you simply don't agree
Now time will come to claim you
And it will have its way
Don't make no mistakes
Don't regret
Don't waste the time that is left
And then do it all with a goddam smile

In the hearts of men
In the arms of mothers
In the parts we play
To convince others
