The gentle little elaine,
Spinning his hat on a cane
Stepping out, out for change
Good morning all, it's a beautiful day
The generals are winning a war
Seemed suicidal before
You came alone, now
I'll protect you, long as you stay
Lllllaaaaa
One of a kind
You'll be walking in the sun
Living in the day
Last night I was about to throw it all away
If patience started a band,
I'd be her biggest fan
Look at me, I'm talking to you
I don't want the lead in your play
The star's just a part of the scene
The gentle man in green
Paying off, out on the street
I can't go home, it's not on my way
Llllllaaaaaa
Things are never done, car's parked in the sun
Living in the day
Last night I was about to throw it all away (4 times)
