Careful waking up the giants
He's a bigger man and a better man than I am
He'll rise up when we hear the sirens
Where's the truth when your heart's not lying?
I believe that the end's not dying
I only listen to the wind when its crying
We're the rhythm of the darkest nights
We're the truth that's been left unspoken
We're the shadows far beyond the lights
We're waking, waking, waking up the giants
Sail away the water's rising
Leaving our regrets behind us
Right before we fail, we'll find it
Right behind the storm it was hiding
I believe the end's not dying
I only listen to the wind when it's crying
We're the rhythm of the darkest nights
We're the truth that been left unspoken
We're the shadows far beyond the lights
We're waking, waking, waking up the giants
We're the rhythm of the darkest nights
We're the truth that's been left unspoken
We're the shadows far beyond the lights
We're waking, waking, waking up the giants
Waking up the giants
Waking up the giants
Waking, waking, waknig up the giants
Waking, waking, waking up the giants
We're the rhythm of the darkest nights
We're the truth that's been left unspoken
We're the shadows far beyond the lights
We're waking, waking, waking up the giants
We're the rhythm of the darkest nights
We're the truth that's been left unspoken
We're the shadows far beyond the lights
We're waking, waking, waking up the giants
Waking, waking, waking up the giants
Waking, waking, waking up the giants
