Sometimes the breaks don't go my way
Sometimes there's no good news today
Sometimes it all just hits the wall
Sometimes i think it's all my fault
But i'm not stressing out
You know i could be dowtown, lost in the crowd
Without even one tiny ray of sunlight,
Breaking through the clouds.

: Chrous:
But, I got the sun when i need it
I got the moon
I've got someone I can talk to
'Cuz i get to everyday see you
I got the sun, got the moon

Raindrops like ice cubes on the ground
And a sound like people talking
There's a lotta things tryin' to keep me down
But i better just keep on walking
'Cuz i'm not stayin here
And looking up at my forecast, its clear
You wrap me up in blue skies
Whenever you are near

: Chrous:
But, I got the sun when i need it
I got the moon
I've got someone I can talk to
'Cuz i get to everyday see you
I got the sun, got the moon

I've got the sun. I've got the moon
I got my best friend
(best that i ever had)
I got a lifeline
(to get me through when it gets bad)
Feels like an angel's following on my heels
hey hey hey hey
You are my sunshine

Ive got the moon
Ive got someone i can talk
"cuz i can everyday see you...
