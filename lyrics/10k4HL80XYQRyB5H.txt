Fuck

These are the hardest four years of my life,
They walk right by me heads turned with closed eyes
They don't even see me
At night in my house I'm still all alone
This is not a home
They don't even see me

The scars on my body, they don't even bleed
I never do this for me
The scars on my body, they don't even bleed
I only do this for you to see

How am I supposed to
See through your eyes
When you never saw the
Stars were falling at your feet?

Is it a song? Is that what they need?
For so long I've tried to get them to hear me
Picking and stabbing, their words feel like knives
Tearing and ripping the seams of my life

I've tried to convince them
Their words hurt like stones
I just wish they'd just leave me alone

I am on my knees
I need you to hear to me
I am on my knees
Hear me, please

How am I supposed to
To hear what you hear
When you never heard the sound
Of our glass hearts breaking
With every tick of the clock when you are gone?

How am I supposed to see through your eyes?

I know what you've been through,
This hell was my life
You have to keep pushing,
I've seen through your eyes

Your days are like pages,
The chapters unread,
You have to keep turning
Your book has no end
