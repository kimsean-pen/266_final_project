Who's going to save tonight
It is hard to not give in because you're no longer breathing
And who's going to save tonight if I don't
Who's going to save tonight
I am down on my knees but I'm too proud to say please
And who's going to save tonight if you won't

All the roads we are traveling up and down
Don't you want our hearts to sing, I'll know myself
But I wonder where you came from, yeah-eh oh-o
Following every step, up and down, running high
Still so far away, and I wonder where you came from, woh-oh yeah-eh

Who's going to save us now when our enemies' calling
When I'm down and I'm falling, baby
Who's going to save us now if we won't
Oh, I don't want to hurt tonight
There is much good in me and there's much good in you
So we got to save tonight 'cause they won't

All the roads we are traveling up and down
Don't you want our hearts to sing, I'll know myself
But I wonder where you came from, yeah-eh oh-o
Following every step, up and down, running high
Still so far away, and I wonder where you came from, woh-oh yeah-eh

Why start a fire when it's all worth saving
Don't you want to know, don't you want to feel me closer too
I walk through wires 'cause it's all worth breaking
And don't you want to know, don't you want to feel me closer too

All the roads we are traveling up and down
I would carry anything that's all I know
You got to tell me where you came from, yeah-eh oh-o
Following every turn up and down want to learn, everything tonight
And I'm going to go to where you came from, woh-oh yeah-eh

'Cause I'm going to go to where you came from
