I would search this world for you
Even though you can't imagine
I wanna take you to China
I wanna kiss you in Rome

I'd use rocket ships, mine sweepers
Transistor radio receivers
I wanna hold you, wanna hold you too tight
Gonna break every bone of everybody in sight

When I'm flying so high
(Flying so high)
Like a bird in the sky
But you're dragging me down, yeah
But you're dragging me down, yeah
But you're dragging me down, down, down, down

I hear your talking and whispers, pale drawn out nails and fingers
I'm seeing shapes behind the curtain
You're looking older but you can't be certain
You're so tired
(You're so tired)

But you just can't sleep
You're so shallow
(You're so shallow)
But you're in too deep

Your hands shaking
Body's lifting, body's mine
I know, I know
'Cause I told you so

When I'm flying so high
(Flying so high)
Like a bird in the sky
But you're dragging me down, yeah
But you're dragging me down, yeah
But you're dragging me down, down, down, down

Oh, you're dragging me down, oh you're dragging me down
Drag, drag, dragging me down, oh you're dragging me down
Oh, you're dragging me, dragging me, dragging me, oh
(You're dragging me down)

(Oh)
I never can quite remember
(Oh)
Was it June, July or September?
(Oh)
That you sold your soul to me, to me
(Oh)
That you sold your soul to me, to me

When I'm flying so high
(Flying so high)
Like a storm in the sky
But you're dragging me down, yeah
But you're dragging me down, yeah
But you're dragging me down, yeah

When I'm flying so high
(Flying so high)
Like a bird in the sky
But you're dragging me down, yeah
But you're dragging me down, yeah
But you're dragging me down, down, down, down

Dragging me down, dragging me down
Dragging me down, dragging me down
Dragging me down, dragging me down
Dragging me down
