Me and Mary Jane - Black Stone Cherry

Me and Mary Jane got a thing goin' on, goin' on
Creepin' up slow, hangin' 'round my back door, my back door!

1:
Blowin' smoke like a freight train,
Yea, we're wilder than some mustangs,
Got the top down and Skynyrd up,
We're laid back, but we're on the up

Ain't nothin' like a Friday night,
And that smell to getcha feelin' right,
I've waited all week for this,
The head party I don't wanna miss

Pre-Somethin' in the air,
And it's takin' control,
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Baby, come on, let it go!

Me and Mary Jane got a thing goin' on, goin' on
Creepin' up slow, hangin' 'round my back door, my back door,
If we get caught, everyone'll see us stoned, see us stoned,
Me and Mary Jane got a thing goin' on, goin' on

2:
We're livin' for the good time,
Good friends across the county line,
The climb is gettin' steeper,
So baby, don't fear the reaper

At midnight, another round,
Fire it up just to burn it down,
It don't come any cheaper,
And nothin' tastes sweeter
