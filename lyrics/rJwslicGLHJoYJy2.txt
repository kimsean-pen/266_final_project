ln the shadows he saw four eyes, lit by fire... fire
He'd never done that with a lover, before... before
Meanwhile everyone else got lost in quiet, by the rivier
Seeking for more, of course he found better
He saw them, they saw him
But everyone just kept on going
What he saw was different
He should have gone to bed
But instead he stuck around for the mood
ln the shadows he saw four eyes, lit by fire... fire
He'd never done that with a lover, before... before
Either early or too late, it was number seven... and it happened
High like a bird with his beak through the window
He saw them, they saw him
But everyone just kept on going
What he saw was different
He should have gone to bed
But instead he stuck around for the mood
He saw them, they saw him
But everyone just kept on going
What he saw was different
He should have gone to bed
But instead he stuck around for the moon
He was seeking for more, he was seeking for more...
