Riding on a bicycle, looking at trees and stuff
Got to school feeling, I dont want to die today
All my friends got problems, going through all kind of stuff
Got to school feeling
Everything will be okay
Everything's gonna be okay
S'Gonna be okay
Tell me its okay
Die another day

Over, dont give up on me, im trying really hard
Swimming in the ocean, looking at birds and planes
I dont wanna die today, i just dont wanna live
Got to school feeling
Everything will be okay
Everything's gonna be okay
S'Gonna be okay
Tell me its okay
Die another day

Yeah its a beautiful day
Clap your hands if you're feeling good
Everything's gonna be okay
Clap your hands if you're with me

Yeah its a beautiful day
Clap your hands if you're feeling good
Everything's gonna be okay
Clap your hands if you're with me

I dont wanna die today, i just dont wanna live
Got to school feeling
Everything will be okay
Everything will be okay
Everything will be okay
Got to school feeling
Everything will be okay

Yeah its a beautiful day
Clap your hands if you're feeling good
Everything's gonna be okay
Clap your hands if you're with me

Yeah its a beautiful day
