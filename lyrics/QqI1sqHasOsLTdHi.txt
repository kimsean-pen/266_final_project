Love hurts, ask Courtney she killed Kurt
I do a bitch like Sid to Nancy if she cheat on me first
I'ma get the world's attention 'for I bleed on this earth
You gon' really get the message if you play this reverse
Okay lyrical combat fatality, who wanna battle me
Because I'mma shatter every atom in his whole anatomy

So instead of me when you stepping closer
You becoming my enemy for the penalty
My antennas up sipping the Hennessy
Okay, Christmas list a bad bitch and some better weed
A new desert E's, 911 with the cherry seats
Drunk driving, doing 90 down the tunnel
with the lady gun on my hip
Bumping Capital Punishment

Just watch and observe the turbulence from the wordsmith
You're hardly worth it and it irks me, what's the purpose?
From the surface I emerge without immersin'
Momma nurse me, unemployed but not thirsty
Fresh out of the box, nina a virgin
Bout to pop a cherry and leave spots on your jersey
Bitches call me 2Cup Shakur, Hennessy pour
Weapons you drawing my integrity on
The thin line between love and hate, kill you
Smoke a blunt at your wake, see you in hell at the gates
My sweater shredded like Freddie but that's the way that it's made
Zombie gang, get the fuck out my face
The fuck is you say?

Y'all play bang-bang
This a army run up on you
Insufficient when I get you
You can keep the pistol on you
Hit the call, it's my dog
Army made official on you
Name brand, god damn
Whole thang glisten on you
Y'all play bang-bang
This a army run up on you
Insufficient when I get you
You can keep the pistol on you
Hit the call, it's my dog
Army official on you
Name brand, god damn
Whole thang glisten on you

Armaggedon
Never leave home without my weapon
This song
Who want one on one with the dead man
Dem why, why wah get destroyed with dem Kevlar
Whole team, whole scene, whole thing, getta
Anything dem a trust, gonna sell off
Liar tell some boy they mean baylage
Play your position, we sinners and not sinners
We always been hot splitters
We won't if the cops get us

Speaking of cops, they shot this cop on my block
He said you know what time it is? I guess he ain't had no watch
Bitch follow, niggas watch, in the game,
hit a spot, for the fame
Money more than a game than a watch, hit a spot
On your blog, let me dig up in your pocket
Let me stack up on your options
Cancelling your profit

Got a problem, got a vent
Got a shot, got a sin
Gotta rob, gotta spend
Is it you, is it him?
Is it us, is it them?
Wonder how we make amends
Watch how they circle the block, hate us cause of our skin
Got a problem, got a vent
Got a shot, got a sin
Gotta rob, gotta spend
Is it you, is it him?
Is it us, is it them?
Wonder how we make amends
Watch how they circle the block, hate us cause of our skin

Y'all play bang-bang
This a army run up on you
Insufficient when I get you
Even keep the pistol on you
Hit the call, it's my dog
Army made official on you
Name brand, god damn
Whole thang glisten on you

Y'all play bang-bang
This a army run up on you
Insufficient when I get you
You can keep the pistol on you
Hit the call, it's my dog
Army made official on you
Name brand, god damn
Whole thang glisten on you
