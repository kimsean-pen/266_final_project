Last night a little dancer came dancin' to my door
Last night a little angel came pumpin' on the floor
She said, hiya baby, you've got a license for love
And if it expires, pray help from above

Because in the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell, more, more, more
In the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell, more, more, more, more

She don't like slavery, she won't sit and beg
But when you tired and lonely, she's there to be
What set you free, and bought you to me, babe
What set you free, I need you here by me

Because in the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell, more, more, more
In the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell, more, more, more

And he lives in his own heaven
There to collects from 7-11
Well, he's out all night in American heaven
Just as long, just as long it don't mess up her hair

I walked the walls for you, baby
Ten thousand miles for you
I dried your tears of pain
A thousand times for (you)
I'd sell my soul for you, baby
For money to burn with you
I'd give you all and have none, babe
Just-a-just-a-just-a-just-a-just-a have you here by me
Because in the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell, more, more, more
In the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell, more, more, more, more
