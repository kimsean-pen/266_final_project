Go!

A wraith with an angel's body
A demon with a smile of gold
You soul-sucker, I won't become like you
A killer with the perfect weapons
Crystal eyes and a heart of coal
You soul-sucker, I won't lose myself in you

Look how pretty she is when she falls down
Now there's no beauty in bleeding mascara
Her lips are quivering like a withering rose
She's back again

What the fuck do you think love means?
It's more than words and more than feelings sucking me dry
Is my marrow that sweet?
Your dead lovers have left a trail of broken hearts and misspent hopes
Sucking them dry
Does their marrow taste of sweetness?
Sweetness, I hope you choke

Look how pretty she is when she falls down
Now there's no beauty in bleeding mascara
Her lips are quivering like a withering rose
She's back again, she's back a...
She's back again, she's back
