The sun is up, summer love
My head spins around like a rollercoaster
Gonna pass it by mine
I turn the key, I lose my wings
I feel life is eternal, never ending
There's a demon in me

The west side town, never know if I will break my neck
No no, I pray don't drown, I might close my eyes to die
'Cause I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted
I can't see what's on, wasted
Don't leave me 'cause I wanna lose my mind today
I'm wasted, uh

In disguise, I might hide
Good kids wanna hold in place the city
When we have the time, oh oh
I run away just for one day
This road makes me feel like the world is changing
And don't coming down

The west side town, never know if I will break my neck
No no, I pray don't drown, I might close my eyes to die
'Cause I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted
I can't see what's on, wasted
Don't leave me 'cause I wanna lose my mind today
I'm wasted, uh

The west side town, never know if I will break my neck
No no, I pray don't drown, I might close my eyes to die
'Cause I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted
I can't see what's on, wasted
Don't leave me 'cause I wanna lose my mind today
I'm wasted, uh
