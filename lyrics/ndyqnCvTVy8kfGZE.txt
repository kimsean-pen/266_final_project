Every endless word
I have nothing here
Sick of all that was
Tired of all that is

Every hated love
I am broken in
Sick of fucking up
Tired of falling in

And all that I regret
I have before and will again

It's over now
(Are you running away?)
I come apart
(As I lay awake!)
It's in my blood
(Let the sky fall down!)
I won't let go
(My oblivion!)

Counting every breath
I am my own fear
Nothing ever was
Nothing ever is

Every halo lost
I am worn within
Nothing left to harm
Nothing left to live

And all that I regret
I have before and will again

It's over now
(Are you running away?)
I come apart
(As I lay awake!)
It's in my blood
(Let the sky fall down!)
I won't let go
(My oblivion!)

Face the monster I've become
(And fight! I will not become!)
In the ground we rise to burn
(Maybe your life will let me love!)
Forgive my heart

It's over now
I come apart

It's in my blood
(Let the sky fall down!)
I won't let go
(My oblivion!)
