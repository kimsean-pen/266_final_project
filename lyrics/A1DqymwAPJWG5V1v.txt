I was lost
In the dead of night
But then came angels
I could not fight on
All of a sudden, I'm fading
I was blinded, by the light
Til you say

Babe
It's okay, it's okay now
Let it out, let it love, let it rain now
Hold me now, hold me down, hold me always
Babe, babe, babe now
Babe, say my name, it's okay now
Say it loud, shout it out, down the hallway
Love me now, love me now, love me always
Babe, babe

There were sirens
Out to get me
So by now, I swear I've heard it all
I just pray
You choose to catch me
But either way, you were always worth the fall
So I said

Babe
It's okay, it's okay now
Let it out, let it love, let it rain now
Hold me now, hold me down, hold me always
Babe, babe, babe
Babe, say my name, it's okay now
Say it loud, shout it out, down the hallway
Love me now, love me now, love me always
Babe, babe, babe, now
Babe, say my name, it's okay now
Say it loud, shout it out, down the hallway
Love me now, love me now, love me always
Babe, babe

Oh hey, all the things that they say
Love cause the thing they choose to hate
Is just a love that they're afraid of
But see, I'm not afraid to take a leap
Not afraid to get too deep
Singing long live the angels
And Hey Hey
Take note of colors in your dreams
Things aren't as dark as they may seem
Rememer fear isn't no way to fall
And I say wha luck to find you in this life
I've been around so many times
I've never found someone so beautiful

So babe
It's okay, it's okay now
Let it out, let it love, let it rain now
Hold me now, hold me down, hold me always
Babe, babe, babe now
Babe, say my name, it's okay now
Shout it out, Say it Loud down the hallway
Hold me now, hold me now, hold me always
Babe, babe, babe, now

So babe
It's okay, it's okay now
Let it out, let it love, let it rain now
Hold me now, hold me down, hold me always
Babe, babe, babe
Babe, say my name, it's okay now
Say it loud, shout it out, down the hallway
Love me now, love me now, love me always
Babe, babe, babe, now

So babe
It's okay, it's okay now
Let it out, let it love, let it rain down
Hold me now, hold me down, hold me always
Babe, babe, babe
Babe, It's okay, it's okay now
Say it loud, shout it out, down the hallway
Love me now, love me now, love me always
Babe, babe, babe, now
