I thought I was a spaceman
Digging out my heart
In some distant sand dunes in a car park

Because the desert has encroached moon
The places where we lived
And people like me fight to keep the demons in
But we never succeeded
We never succeeded
In fact, we failed

I thought I was a spaceman
Digging out my heart
In some distant sand dunes in a car park

By the empty harbour
Where the junk boat phantoms float
The fight for Happy Valley
Sadly, the line broke

Thought I'd found my black box
Washed up on the shore
On outlying islands past the landfall

Thought I thought I'd found it
But that was not true at all
I'd walked into a bar and raised hell

Cut the chasm out me
Always and always the same
Put the ghost in writing
And let it be (you again)

I thought I was a spaceman
Digging out my heart
In some distant sand dunes in Hyde Park

I thought I was a spaceman
Digging out my heart
In some distant sand dunes you again

I thought I was a spaceman
Digging out my heart
In some distant sand dunes you again
You again
You again
