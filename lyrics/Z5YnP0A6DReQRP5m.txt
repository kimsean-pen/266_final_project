No I shouldn't have mentioned
Wasn't worth the attention
Wasn't worth it when I thought about it
Wish that I could take it all back
Can we go another direction
So we can enjoy ourselves
When I give it everything I want love it
And never have to give it all back

Forget about every lie I said, and the ones you told me back
Forget about every way I bled just to get nothing back
Yeah I did it for a second too long, now I'm done with that
Cause everything I'm doing now is gonna have a purpose

What if it was all left up to us
What if it we decided it was up to us
What if we divided it up for once
A side for glory, and a side guts
A side for them, and a side for us
What if it was all left up to them
We would be divided and conquering
And conquer them

You could have mentioned
That you needed attention
Is it even worth it now to talk about it
I wish that we could take it all back
Can we go another direction
Instead of trying to enjoy ourselves

Forget about every lie I said, and the ones you told me back
Forget about every way I bled just to get nothing back
Yeah I did it for a second too long, now I'm done with that
Cause everything I'm doing now is gonna have a purpose

What if it was all left up to us
What if it we decided it was up to us
What if we divided it up for once
A side for glory, and a side guts
A side for them, and a side for us
What if it was all left up to them
We would be divided and conquering
And conquer them

I don't wanna go this far anymore

What if it was all left up to us
What if it we decided it was up to us
What if we divided it up for once
A side for glory, and a side guts
A side for them, and a side for us
What if it was all left up to them
We would be divided and conquering
And conquer them
