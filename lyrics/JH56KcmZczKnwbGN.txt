Talk bad, walk bad, tear the place up
Work bad, my damn eyes are on ya
You got something all the girls want
And I just want to get to know ya

Don't quit, keep this going on all night
Shake that, hey that body's so right, oh
You got something all the guys like
And I just want to get to know ya

Tell me what you want and I'll give it
Just as long as you know where we're headed
Back to my place when it's all over, oh, oh,
That's when I'm sober baby

Ohh, gonna make you mine tonight
I wanna rock with you 'til sunrise
Can I, let me do all the little things you like

Oh-wee tell me what is your name
All I know is I'm loving that frame, ohh,
Everything about you drives me insane
And I just want to get to know ya
Cause all that I see when I'm looking at you
Is all the crazy things I want to do
Let me get close to you and I'll show all you need and more
Ohhh,

So gonna make you mine tonight, night,
I wanna rock with you 'til sunrise
Can I, let me do all the little things you like
Ohh, so will you let me blow your mind, mind
Want you to have the time of your life
Can I, let me do all the little things you like
I'm gonna make you mine tonight
I wanna rock with you 'til sunrise
Can I, let me do all the little things you like

Game zone, let me know
Baby we can take it slow,

But you shine like a star
If you let me, I can take you so far
And baby now,

Whatever you want to do, baby it's up to you,
Tell me what's on your mind,
I want to do all the things you like.
