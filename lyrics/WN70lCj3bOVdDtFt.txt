Sometimes I worry when you're working late
I know you got a lot on your plate
I see your passion and I think it's cool
I think it's sexy that you live your truth
Now I might tell you speed it up
But I won't tell you give it up
'cos I'm not like the regular
Together we're so much better

It might not be good for anyone else
But it's good for us
And I'm so glad that I found somebody that I can trust
Babe I've got you-u-u-u
And you've got me to-o-o-o-o

I know you could be out there doing dirt
But you know what our love is worth
And folks always expect the worse
But i see us on top of the world
Yeah, I might tell you speed it up
But I won't tell you give it up
'cos I'm not like the regular
Together we're so much better

It might not be good for anyone else
But it's good for us
And I'm so glad that I found somebody that I can trust
Babe I've got you-u-u-u
And you've got me to-o-o-o-o

Listen up, yeah we got potential
So I'll keep it simple, when it comes to you
Yeah, yeah
We're my favourite people
So whether things go up or down
It's still you

It might not be good for anyone else
But it's good for us
And I'm so glad that I found somebody that I can trust
Babe I've got you-u-u-u
And you've got me to-o-o-o-o

It might not be good for anyone else
But it's good for us
And I'm so glad that I found somebody that I can trust
Babe I've got you-u-u-u
And you've got me to-o-o-o-o
