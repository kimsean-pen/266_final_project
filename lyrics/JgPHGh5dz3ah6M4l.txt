Out like a butterfly, in like a bee
June is here, yes yes siree
Happy times for you and me

May was totally lame
Nothing happened at all
July will not rock very much
I have to go visit my grandma

School's out for summer
Totally not a bummer
Hey, let's jam to that Don Caballero
Chew some gum and do the mack nasty

Because it's June, it's June June June
Just because it's June, June, June
June June June June June
Gives me more time to read "Dune"

Totally wack
