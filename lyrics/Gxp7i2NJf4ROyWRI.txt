I need a place to go
Yeah, that's what you told me
So I went to your house
To try to find you in your room
Why can't I find you now?

Walking along tonight
Wishing you were still here
Wishing things were alright

We tried, oh yeah
We tried and we died
Oh yeah, we died

We tried, oh yeah
We tried and we died
Oh yeah, we died

We took down the icicles
The way it melts in your hand
You told me you loved me
At an age I didn't understand
I didn't understand

Walking along tonight
Wishing you were still here
Wishing things were alright

We tried, oh yeah
We tried and we died
Oh yeah, we died

We tried, oh yeah
We tried and we died
Oh yeah, we died

Where will we go
When we get old?
Where will we go
When we get old?

We tried, oh yeah
We tried and we died
Oh yeah, we died

We tried, oh yeah
We tried and we died
Oh yeah, we died

We tried, oh yeah
We tried and we died
Oh yeah, we died

We tried, oh yeah
We tried
