I know you, who are you now?
Look into my eyes if you can't remember
Do you remember, oh?

I can see, I can still find
You're the only voice my heart can recognize
But I can't hear you now, yeah

I'll never be the same
I'm caught inside the memories, the promises
Are yesterdays and I belong to you
I just can't walk away
'Cause after loving you
I can never be the same

And how can I pretend I've never known you?
Like it was all a dream, no
I know I'll never forget
The way I always felt with you beside me
And how you loved me then, yeah

I'll never be the same
I'm caught inside the memories, the promises
Are yesterdays and I belong to you
I just can't walk away
'Cause after loving you
I can never be the same

You led me here
Then I watched you disappear
You left this emptiness inside
And I can't turn back time
No, stay!
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares to you
I can't let you go
Can't let you go
I can't let go

I'll never be the same
Not after loving you
Not after loving you, no
I'll never be the same
I'm caught inside the memories, the promises
Are yesterdays and I belong to you
I just can't walk away
'Cause after loving you
I can never be the same

I can never be the same
I will never be the same
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I just can't walk away
No, I can't walk away
From you
