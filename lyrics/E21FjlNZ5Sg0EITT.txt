January clipped your wires
The summer went straight through your tires
Every faded sign that passed you
Used to point the way towards you
Lately you've come to enjoy the generosity of strangers
The mechanisms you employ
And you've gone, you know that I'm not scared to go home
We have got to know, know that I'm not scared to go home

Light aircraft they overfly you
Instruments they veer towards you
Every fallen stone that passed you
Used to form a wall around you
Maybe you've come to rely on the generosity of strangers
The mechanisms you employ
You've gone, you know that I'm not scared to go home
We have got to know, know that I'm not scared to go home

January clipped your wires
The summer went straight through your tires
Every faded sign that passed you
Used to point the way towards you
Lately you've come to enjoy the generosity of strangers
The mechanisms you employ

You've gone, you know that I'm not scared to go home
We have got to know, know that I'm not scared to go home
