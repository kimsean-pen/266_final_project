My time, all my life
Some way, I saved
The memory, the pending,
The family, surround me

A god given time,
A god given gift of life.
A time to take away,
To kill the pain,
To give me to the ground.

The pills, the windowsill
Razor blade, great escape
So lonely, the feeling,
The slipping, the bleeding

Good lord where are you found?
Carry judgement way underground
I hear you laughing out loud
Should've changed my way by now...

Hero...

A god given time,
A god given gift of life.
A time to take away,
To kill the pain,
To give me to the ground.
