Your on the telephone
Telling me that she's gone
Now we've been down this road a million times before

Cause it's a sweet sensation
Thinking of all that hot temptation
You know it's going right where you want
Yeah, you know what's going on

I keep breaking my own rules playing your love fool
Trying to forget about the consequence
We keep saying we should and yeah we know we could stop
But really what it all comes down to is

It feels so good
It feels so good, when I'm in your arms

Don't you know, It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good

You say it's dangerous you don't wanna be exposed
But I know your like a mess and your not gonna let it go

Cause it's a sweet sensation
Thinking of all that hot temptation
You know it's going right where you want
Yeah, you know what's going on

I keep breaking my own rules playing your love fool
Trying to forget about the consequence
We keep saying we should and yeah we know we could stop
But really what it all comes down to is

It feels so good
It feels so good, when I'm in your arms

Don't you know, It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good

It feels so good
Feels so good
Just move with me
Move with me
Move with me

Oh, won't you move with me
Move with me
Move with me

I keep breaking my own rules playing your love fool
Trying to forget about the consequence
We keep saying we should and yeah we know we could stop
But really what it all comes down to is

It feels so good
It feels so good, when I'm in your arms

Don't you know, It feels so good,
It feels so good
It feels so good
