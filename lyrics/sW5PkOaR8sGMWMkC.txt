You can drive your fast car
Through the village 'til you die
Or you could take another deep breath swinging
For the days I could watch you run

Through the white lighted street
Where the houses stay the same
Where we could drink
'Til we'd never remember our names

You could bring me to life
You could bring me to life

So we can hang our noose under stars bright ready to glow
And we could fall in love for the weekend
We're on the edge baby, two hearts starting to slow
And we could fall in love for the weekend

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

We can dream in white hot color
And ecstasy will fade into the silence of our dead night freezing
When the smoke cleared I awoke here
Caught in the patterns of the mess that we've been making
We can play pretend 'til it gets dark
And count the seconds until everything falls apart

You could bring me to life
You could bring me to life

So we can hang our noose under stars bright ready to glow
And we could fall in love for the weekend
We're on the edge baby, two hearts starting to slow
And we could fall in love for the weekend

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

We're the new kids waiting on the edge and we're ready to go
We could fall in love for the weekend
We're on the edge of a shotgun ready to blow
And we could fall in love for the weekend

Just give me one shot in my veins and I'll be ready to love
So we could fall in love for the weekend
You know I'm trying too hard but it isn't enough
So we could fall in love for the weekend

Oh oh oh oh

So we can hang our noose under stars bright ready to glow
So we could fall in love for the weekend
We're on the edge baby, two hearts starting to slow
So we could fall in love for the weekend

We're the new kids waiting on the edge and we're ready to go
And we could fall in love for the weekend
We're on the edge of a shotgun ready to blow
And we could fall in love for the weekend

Oh oh oh oh
