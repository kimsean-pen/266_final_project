You keep me spinnin' around
Round(7x, echo)

I was thinkin' bout yesterday
I was thinkin' bout tomorrow
In a dizzy kinda sorta way
Like vertigo
I've been tryin' hard to figure out
But it's drivin' me crazy
Well you'd think I'd know by now

A is last Z is first
Livin' life in reverse 'cause that's the way it works

Spinnin' around I've got this funny feeling
Turnin' my whole world upside-down
I'll keep my heart, my eyes on you
Cause you keep me spinnin around

What we're doin' doesn't have a sequel
Don't wanna lose your balance
Oh you know you gotta keep your equilibrium
Goin' backwards to go forward
All these definite maybes
It's like runnin' around in circles

Make it last, take it slow
Just forget what you know
Cause that's the way it goes

Spinnin' around I've got this funny feelin'
Turnin' my whole world upside-down
I'll keep my heart, my eyes on you
Cause you keep me spinnin' around, spinnin' around

Every now and then I feel your peacefulness surround me
Then once again it all goes
Up and down
Over, under, round and around

Go, Go, Go
Jump, Jump
Go, Go, Go, J-5
Spinnin' around (oh yeah, yeah)
Upside-down (oh yeah, yeah)
J-5 in the house (hey)
Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump
Turnin', turnin' me upside-down (Down)
Spinnin', Spinnin, Spinnin' me around (Round)
Go(jump) Go (jump) Go (jump) Go (jump)
Spinnin'around that's the way it works
Take it slow and not so fast(fast)
Z is first and A is last(last)
Up and down, all around (hey, hey)
Turnin' my whole world upside-down

Oh yeah it's not the take it's the give
'cause that's the way okay, that way it is

spinnin' around i've got this funny fellin'
turnin' my whole world upside down
i'll keep my heart and my eyes on you
'cause you keep me spinnin' around!
