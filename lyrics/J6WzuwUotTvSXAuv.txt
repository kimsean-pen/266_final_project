Soft sympathetic patch of ground
Where I can lay my heavy burden down
Oh beautiful scene in decay
There to remind us that nothing stays the same

If this be my last night on earth
Let me remember this for all that its worth
If this be my last night on earth
Let me remember this for all that its worth

Wild fruit, sands, override on the vine
Wild creatures come gather round to suckle their wine
The birds they feed before they take flight
As the weary sun succumbs to their heavy eyelids that is life

If this be my last night on earth
Let me remember this for all that its worth
If this be my last night on earth
Let me remember this for all that its worth

Intoxicated birds glide in a swarm
They sing to me their drunken tunes

This is your last night on earth
Remember us for all that we were
Take sweet memories with you, with you
And plant those seeds somewhere new

This is your last night on earth
Remember us for all that we were
Take sweet memories with you, with you
And plant those seeds somewhere new
