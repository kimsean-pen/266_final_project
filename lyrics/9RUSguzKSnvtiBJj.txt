I'd die before I let you in

Lost in a moment of time
Self-destruct, switch on
I try, but it happens the same
Every day

Here I go, standing on the edge
Holding on to the bitter end
This is it, this is me
With the weight of the whole world on my shoulders again
As I look up to the sky
All the pain that is in my eyes
It's all the things that you don't see
But you best believe that it's haunting me

Stuck inside this fucking mind
Goodbye, I will shut down
Mission abort, down for the count
Stuck in a cycle, trapped in a nightmare
Losing what matters, see if I fight fair

Here I go, standing on the edge
Holding on to the bitter end
This is it, this is me
With the weight of the whole world on my shoulders again
As I look up to the sky
All the pain that is in my eyes
It's all the things that you don't see
But you best believe that it's haunting me

I'm afraid, I'm afraid
This is what I can't be
Get away, get away
I just wanna be happy
I'm afraid, I'm afraid
This is what I can't be
Get away, get away
I just wanna be happy

I set sail on a voyage unknown
Aboard a vessel that I call my soul
And I've been searching for what makes me whole
Sinking in the ocean on an empty boat
Take me home
I'm lost all alone, all alone
I set sail on a voyage unknown
Aboard a vessel that I call my soul
And I've been searching for what makes me whole
Sinking in the ocean on an empty boat

Here I go, standing on the edge
Holding on to the bitter end
This is it, this is me
With the weight of the whole world on my shoulders again
As I look up to the sky
All the pain that is in my eyes
It's all the things that you don't see
But you best believe that it's haunting me

That it's haunting me
