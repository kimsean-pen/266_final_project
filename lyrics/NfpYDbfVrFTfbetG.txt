Thank you for being such a friend to me
Oh, I pray a friend for life
And have I ever told you how much you mean to me?
Oh, you're everything to me

And I am so lost for words
And I am so overwhelmed

Please don't go just yet
Can you stay a moment please?
We can dance together
We can dance forever

Under your stars tonight
And I am so overwhelmed
By a thousand broken wings
A thousand broken wings

So close your eyes but don't dream too deep
And please pass me some memories
And when I fall you're underneath
A thousand broken hearts
Carried by a thousand broken wings
A thousand broken wings
A thousand broken wings

A thousand voices singing reasons
Of understanding why it happens
A thousand voices singing reasons
Of understanding why it happens
A thousand voices singing reasons
Of understanding why it happens
