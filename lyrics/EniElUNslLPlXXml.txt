Dead walking!

I've got to get out,
Got to get away from here somehow,
I've got to get out,
Got to get away from this crowd.

Rise, come alive, have hope,
Our fight, the struggle in life,
To make our own way across to the other side.

Show me the light,
Illuminate the night,
Got to get out of sight,
Stop fueling this endless fight.
[x2]

Realize!
Realize, you've been living a goddamn lie,
I've been watching the shadows moving in different ways,
I have seen the way the world has changed,
I don't trust the dark these days.

I've been watching the shadows moving in different ways,

To make our own way across to the other side.

Show me the light,
Illuminate the night,
Got to get out of sight,
Stop fueling this endless fight.

As I fall away, I'll find myself someday, somehow, someway [x3]
