I come from far and wide
Travel in her cross' great divide
Once it has ran the course
I'll be one step close to the source

Whether it not I'll be rolling on
Rolling on
Rolling on to your long gone
Please refrain from believing in me
I'll only cause you grief
It's my common courtesy to bother you blatantly
Whether or not I'll be rolling on
Rolling on
Rolling on to your long gone
Rolling on
If this tourney ever comes to a stop of
Rolling on
I'll be forever feeling guilty
No matter where I'll be

I'm rolling, rolling on
To your long gone
I'm rolling, rolling on
To your long gone
