This ain't rock'n'roll, this is genocide
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicon hump and your ten-inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Todd Browning streak he was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see

The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal
I keep a friend serene

(Will they come?)
Oh, baby, come unto me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby

You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
That Halloween Jack is a real cool cat

And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh Tarzie, go man go

Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face her is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch

Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed, Diamond Dogs are stabilized

I'll keep a friend serene

(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come unto me
(Will they come?)

Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby

You'll catch your death in the fog

Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
(There's gonna be sorrow) Try and wake up tomorrow
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come unto me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Bow-wow, woof woof, bow-wow, wow
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Dogs
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them, ooo
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Keep cool
Diamond Dogs rule, ok
Hey-hey-hey-hey
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
