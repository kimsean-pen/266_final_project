I got the drank, I got the smoke in rotation
Head on a swivel, rotation
I got the backdoor swinging, rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation

112th street, dude, slime, tell a friend
Parking lots, dope spots, hard rock, I'ma get
Duke it out and shoot it out, fuck a opp, who was him?
Pack him out, I stall him out, we need to find out where he live
GTA, 2 elevens, double dutching, Mack-11s
Section 8, welfare, EBTs on the dresser
Crash dummies, real killers, fast money kill niggas
Blast for me, real nigga, ask for me, deal with you

Pay your fare, play it fair, here's a scale, weight it here
Kick a door, head choke, take it all, hit the stairs
Yellow bricks, peddle bricks, get a ounce, get a zip
Shawty bounce, hit his hip, make that body do a flip
I'm a vet, I'ma rep, I'm a boss, I'ma flex
I'ma turn up for the set, take this bottle to the neck
Pre-rolls for the hoes, more licks for the homies
Five hundred for the K, share it with the members only

I got the drank, I got the smoke in rotation
Head on a swivel, rotation

Pull up, pop shit
Hop out drop shit
Chopsticks on me
Pull up, pop shit
Hop out drop shit
Chopsticks on me

To all the real niggas, let's pledge allegiance right now
Okay, I slide by myself, I don't need no help (that's right)
Chopper on the seat, no safety belt (say what?)
I slide by myself, I don't need no help (that's right)

Get off if you mad, get off if you mad
Get off if you mad, get off if you mad
I'ma get off if I'm mad
Get off if I'm mad, get off if I'm mad
I'ma get off if I'm mad
