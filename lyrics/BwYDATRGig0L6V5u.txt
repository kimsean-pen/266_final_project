it's a white ocean and a tight emotion
and our homes are chosen, yet still wear all burden
it's been a while now since that old town,
down by the water
picking stones from the ground
take me HOME,
to the friends I've always known
take me HOME
back to the place where I belong
(Guitar break)
a distant coast line, what peaks insight,
washing the white of that Ocean's Tide.
need to slow down and look around,
not that far from the place we came.
take me HOME
to the friends I've always known,
take me HOME,
back to the place where I belong.
(Guitar break)
