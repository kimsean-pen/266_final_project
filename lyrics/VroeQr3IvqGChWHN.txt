I tasted, tasted love so sweet
And all of it was lost on me
Bought and sold like property
Sugar on my tongue

I kept falling over
I kept looking backward
I went broke believing
That the simple should be hard

All we are, we are
All we are, we are
And everyday's a start of something beautiful

I wasted, wasted love for you
Traded it out for something new
But it's hard to change the way you lose

If you think you never won
'Cause all we are, we are
All we are, we are

And everyday's a start of something beautiful
And in the end
The words won't matter

'Cause in the end
Nothing stays the same
And in the end dreams just scatter

And fall like rain
'Cause all we are, we are
All we are, we are
And everyday's a start of something beautiful
Something real
All we are, we are
All we are, we are
And everyday's the start of something beautiful
Beautiful
