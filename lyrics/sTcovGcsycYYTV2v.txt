When the night wont fall and the sun wont rise
and you see the best as you close your eyes
when you reach the top as you bottom out
but you understand what its all about

Nothings ever what it seems
in your life or in your dreams
it dont make sense what can you do
so I wont try making sense of you

Chorus:
Love just is... Whatever it may be
Love just is... You & Me
Nothing Less and Nothing More
I Dont Know what I love you for
Love just is

When You ask to stay and then disappear
it seems you're gone but you're really here
when every move seems out of place
but every kiss is filled with grace

Somethings never get defined
in your heart or in your mind
It dont make sense what can u do
so I wont try making sense of you

Chorus

Dont Ever ask me for reasons
I cant get to you
Dont ever ask me for reasons
Why I Live for you... I Just Do

Nothings ever what it seems
in your life or in your dreams
it dont make sense what can you do
so I wont try making sense of you

Chorus
