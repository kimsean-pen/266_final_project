Call him Mr. Raider call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain
Call him Mr. Raider call him Mr. Wrong
Call him insane
He'd say: I know what I want
and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr. Vain

Call me Raider call me Wrong
Call me insane call me Mr. Vain
Call me what you like
As long as you call me time and again
Feel the presence of the aura
of the man none to compare
Loveless dying
For a chance just to touch a hand
or a moment to share
Can't deny the urge that makes them
want to lose themselves to the debonair one
Hold me back the simple fact is
that i'm all that and i'm always near
one sexy can't perplex me now
You know who's raw
as if you didn't know before
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you and then I want a little more

Call him Mr. Raider call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain
Call him Mr. Raider call him Mr. Wrong
Call him insane
He'd say: I know what I want
and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr. Vain

Girls are all over the world
they hope and pray and die for men
Like me cause I'm the one
begotten son that breaks the mould
Get a look at male epitome
Style has never seen
That makes you want to grab and hold
and squeeze real tight
Whose gonna be the one to save
you from yourself
When you wanna take a bite
please oh baby please
You beg you want you say
You got to get some caught
Up in the charm that I laid on thick
And now there's nowhere
to run
just another fish to fit the
worm on the hook of my line
Yeah I keep many females
longing for a chance to win my heart
with S E X and plenty
