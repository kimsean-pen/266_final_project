He's just a slutty little flirt and sister he's only gonna hurt you (watch yourself)
Ladies I'm screaming out to you from the depths of this phallocentric tyranny
My self-conceptions awaiting your invasion clumsy penetration punishment (oh yeah)
When the hope of another wet nightmare is all we have to live for

Can't help it if it's true, don't wanna be your man, just wanna play with you (play with you)
I can't help it if it's true, don't wanna be your man, no I just wanna (play with you)

He predicted the eight-bit empire now he occupies the blur as well
When asking why their kisses are sorrowful remember the howl of our first verse
(My memento little star)

Ooh ahh (4x)

(And again)

Ahh!
Ninjas!
(Ninjas)
Prove it!
(Prove it)
Right!
(Right)

Can't help it if it's true, don't wanna be your man--play, play--with m-Ahh!

Can't help it if it's true, don't wanna be your man, just wanna play with you (play with you)
I can't help it if it's true, don't wanna be your man (Hey!)
