Fear me
I am destruction of innocence
I am the violence embedded in flesh
I am the pain in the bones of the mortal shell

The dark heart of the Earth
I am Hell
I am hell

Fear me
I am destruction of innocence
I am the violence embedded in flesh

I am the pain in the bones of the mortal shell
The dark heart of the Earth
I am Hell

Fear at the throats of the father of deception
Let the blood of the cowards flow as the wines
False claims of retribution
May they choke on their lies

Lay waste the relics
Silence the hymns of deceit

You will know pain
You will see the true face of panic
Devastation now and forever
Reign of darkness

The masses one with the cursed
Godless in time
No longer a helpless slave
To the mask of the divine

Lay waste the age of man
Return to the Earth
You will know pain
You will see the true face of panic

Devastation
Now and forever
Reign of darkness

Fear me
I am destruction of innocence
I am the violence embedded in flesh

I am the pain in the bones of the mortal shell
The dark heart of the Earth
I am Hell.
