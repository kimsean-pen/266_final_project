I saw a man-shape
Within the bone-dome
Went to ask who 'twas
From the ether-mouth
Was told 'twas myself
In shape of Mannaz
And that it was not quiet
But came through in waves
These waves can only be seen
By the eye-third
From the below
When the above broke

Go stand by the edge
The mouth spoke out
And separate the words
From the noise-stream

So many words I saw
From earth and the other-world
Of the sun, of the Sea
Of the Blood and Seed

Hindsight into the present
The twos of time in harmony
The bear dreaming while
Hunting prey-flesh while dreaming

The sacred knot is tied
The mind-knot will hold
The shadow bound for ever more
Beast and beast, fish and fish

I waded out into the stream
From both sides
The water was space
We were time
We are time
We became again
We are once more
We will be again
