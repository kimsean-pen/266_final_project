You think there will be no one
To listen to you
When you confess your sins
You feel so left alone

You wait for someone
To give you a sign
You wait for someone
To show you the way

I travelled through dark times
Like a light in the dark,
I'm shining from above
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive

I travelled through dark times
Like a light in the dark,
I'm shining from above
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive

I'll be there for you
When you pray to me
You have to believe
In my bright existence

I'll be there for you
When you pray to me
You have to believe
In my bright existence

You think there will be no one
To listen to you
When you confess your sins
You feel so left alone

You wait for someone
To give you a sign
You wait for someone
To show you the way

I travelled through dark times
Like a light in the dark,
I'm shining from above
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive

I travelled through dark times
Like a light in the dark,
I'm shining from above
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive

I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive

I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive

I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive

I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive

I'll be there for you
When you pray to me
You have to believe
In my bright existence

I'll be there for you
When you pray to me
You have to believe
In my bright existence
