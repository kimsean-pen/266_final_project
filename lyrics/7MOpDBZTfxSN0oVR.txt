Did you ever contemplate when all was lost you hesitate
And nothing seems the same?
Have you ever hid your face, in such disgrace, decisions made
A picture with no frame?

Can you hold on one more day?

Say you're okay
I'm afraid that tomorrow is just too far away
Fight the pain
It just feels like forever is crashing down on me
Down on me, me, me

Rain will fall
Wash all the pain
It shields the soul, you turn the page
To face another day
Let me know that you will wait and I will pay for my mistakes
To feel the sun again

Can you hold on?

Say you're okay
I'm afraid that tomorrow is just too far away
Fight the pain
It just feels like forever is crashing down on me

Don't let go, time will heal
Just don't let go (don't let go, don't let go)
One day we can learn to start again

Say you're okay
I'm afraid that tomorrow is just too far away
Fight the pain
It just feels like forever (feels like forever) forever
It feels like forever is crashing down on me
Down on me, me, me
Down on me!
