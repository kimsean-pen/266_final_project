Ming: How peaceful it looks
Ming: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Klytus: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, most effective, your majesty. Will you destroy this... Earth?

Ming: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

Flash, a-ah, saviour of the universe
Flash, a-ah, you saved everyone of us (Ming: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)

Flash, a-ah, he's a miracle
Flash, a-ah, king of the impossible

He's for everyone of us
Stand for everyone of us
He saved with a mighty hand
Every man, every woman
Every child - He's a mighty flash

Flash, a-ah

Flash, a-ah, you saved everyone of us

Just a man
With a man's courage
You know he's
Nothing but a man
He can never fail
No-one but the pure at heart
May find the Golden Grail
Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh
