Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends
Oh baby, it might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious

'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh baby, baby

Oops!... I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby

Oops!... You think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

You see my problem is this
I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes, they truly exist

I cry, watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool
In so many ways

But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me

Oops!... I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby

Oops!... You think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

"Jätkät hei, mä lähen meneen ny ihan oikeesti"
"Hei Ankku hei, ennen ku lähet ni kato mitä mä toin sulle"
"Ei jumalauta, hyvännäkönen. Siis eiks tää oo siis..."
"On on, sixpack, kyll"
"Eihän sun ois tarvinnu hyvä mies"
"Sitä paitsi meill' on noita väkeviä"
"Nii nii, mut aamuks!"

Oops!... I did it again to your heart
Got lost in this game, oh baby, baby
Oops!... You think that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

Oops!... I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby

Oops!... You think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
