Rio Summit, '92
Street people kidnapped, hid from view
"To save the Earth", our rulers met
Some had other secret plans

No!
No!
No!
No!

Biotech
Say what?

Strip-mine the Amazon
Of cells of life itself
Gold rush for genes is on
Natives get nothing

Biotech
Biotech
Biotech
Is Godzilla
(Godzilla)

Mutations cooked in labs
Money-mad experiments
New food and medicine?
New germs and accidents!
Like Cubat√£o
"World's most polluted town"
Air melts your face
Deformed children all around

Bio-technology
Ain't what's so bad
Like all technology
It's in the wrong hands
Cut-throat corporations
Don't give a damn
When lots of people die
From what they've made

Biotech
Biotech
Biotech, is AIDS?
Stop!
