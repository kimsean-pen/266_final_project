I walked down from the mountain
Failed to find youth from the fountain
I summoned the Gods of old by a song
And then I killed them all

When there was a storm I sang louder
After I failed I tried harder
If I didn't like how the lake reflected me
The lake would dry

I am a human
Disgraceful is humanity
I am a human
Destroyer of many worlds, not one
I can end another animal
Deeming they are suffering
But this ample mercy's not for me

Man came down from the mountain
Blind for the love all around him
The last beautiful heartbeat

We could save our world, but we are what we are
We should love our Earth, but we are what we are
It takes care of our loved ones
But we are what we are...

You haven't thought of this, have you?
The place we call home, without value
If you didn't like how the songbird greeted thee
The bird would die...

The ship we leave behind us has no anchor
Thus your only child will sail too far from the sun...

We could save our world, but we are what we are
We should love our Earth, but we are what we are
It takes care of our loved ones
But we are what we are...

We could save our world, but we are what we are
We should love our Earth, but we are what we are
And take care of our loved ones
But we are what we are...

We could love our world, but we are what we are
We should save our Earth, but we are what we are
It would save our loved ones
But we are what we are...
But we are what we are...
But we are what we are...
But we are what we are...
But we are what we are...
But we are what we are...
But we are what we are...
But we are what we are...
But what are we?
