Chemical days so I can draw
Conclusions in my ways
I've come to take as law
Always you'd be the aftersight
Always you'd be the aftersight

If the car beside you moves ahead
As much as it feels as though you're dead
You're not going backwards
You're not going backwards
If the car beside you moves ahead
As much as it feels as though you're dead
You're not going backwards
You're not going backwards

How can you sleep?
How can you sleep?

Chemical days so I can draw
Conclusions I've come to take as law
Always Pakistan and Netherlands

If the car beside you moves ahead
As much as it feels as though you're dead
You're not going backwards
You're not going backwards
If the car beside you moves ahead
As much as it feels as though you're dead
You're not going backwards
You're not going backwards
