Clouds above go sailing by
I found my meaning in this life
clear white is flying in my eyes,
underneath a blue, blue sky
The waves come rolling in with the tide.
I've been away too long
and everyday I missed you more.
You look like you did before
only prettier.
Everyday I love you more.

All the people rushing by, by, by
looking for meaning in this life
so used up, and blinded by lies,
They're underneath the blue, blue sky
the way they seldom seem to smile
I don't know why.

'Cause I've been away too long
and everyday I missed you more.
You look like you did before,
only prettier.
Everyday I love you more.
I love you more,
everday I love you more,
and more.

Cause I've been away too long
and everyday I missed you more.
You look like you did before,
only prettier.
And everyday I missed you more,
and more and more and more and more.
I've been away too long
and everyday I missed you more
oh you look like you did before
only prettier
everyday I love you more.
