I pray to God, that he makes me feel alright
Hope he gets me through this one more night
I pray to God, he's like one too many drinks
And my intuition starts to sink

It's like ba-da-da-da-da-da
Your shadows, they follow
And they're haunting me
Ba-da-da-da-da-da
Where'd you go?
This hollow soul is lonely

I'm on my knees, begging pretty please
I'm so love drunk stupid off these memories
Mother Mary please, have mercy on me
The Sun came up and I can't believe you're over me

When I'm hung over you
When I'm hung over you

I swear to God, that I won't do this again
I've already wasted all my sins
I swear to God, I'm so sick of what you do
But I'll never get enough of you

It's like ba-da-da-da-da-da
Your shadows, they follow
And they're haunting me
Ba-da-da-da-da-da
Where'd you go?
This hollow soul is lonely

I'm on my knees, begging pretty please
I'm so love drunk stupid off these memories
Mother Mary please, have mercy on me
The Sun came up and I can't believe you're over me

When I'm hung over you
When I'm hung over you

I swear to God
I swear to God
I swear to God
I swear to God
I swear to God
I swear to God
I swear to God
I swear to God

When I'm hung over you
When I'm hung over you

I'm on my knees, begging pretty please
I'm so love drunk stupid off these memories
Mother Mary please, have mercy on me
The Sun came up and I can't believe you're over me

When I'm hung over you
When I'm hung over you

I swear to God
I swear to God
I swear to God
I swear to God
I swear to God
I swear to God
I swear to God
I swear to God

When I'm hungover
