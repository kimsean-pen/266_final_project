I'm too tired to smile again
And I'm too hurt to ever be friends
There's no use in lying again
And I'm too bruised to fight anything

I'm so tired of being afraid
And I'm so sick of wasting away
And there's no truth in whatever you say
You tore my heart out again and again

I can feel you in my chest
You're suffocating every breath
And I can't scream and shout anymore

Anymore, Anymore, Anymore

And maybe I'll jump ship
Cut my losses cash my chips
I can sail alone, leave that love that I've called home
And I will call your bluff
Hope to god that it's enough
Though it cuts my soul
It's the only thing I've ever known

You tore out my heart
You tore out my heart
You tore out my heart
