This place is set to break
It's just as safe from the outside tonight

And I want that
I face the storm's appetite
From the Lighthouse

And I want that
I embrace the storm and the night
Whole...

What do the waves have to say now?
What do the waves have to say now, now?
Slow now...

And let the waves have their way now, now
Slow...
And let the waves have their day

And I want that

Here I've been living unloosened from sin
Upward and Outward
" Begin, begin. "

Here I've been loosened, unliving within
Inwardly Urgent
I'm sinking again

The Lighthouse
