Can I touch you?
Are you out of touch?
I guess I never - noticed that much

Geranium lover
I'm live on your wire
Oh come and take me - whoever you are

She's a lot like you
The dangerous type
She's a lot like you
Come on and hold me tight...

Oh inside angel
Always upset
Keeps on forgettin'
That we ever met
Can I bring you out in the light?
My curiosity's got me tonight

She's a lot like you
The dangerous type
Ooh she's a lot like you
Come on and hold me tight...

Museum directors
With high shaking heads
They kick white shadows
Until they play dead
They want to crack your crossword smile
Oh can I take you out for awhile, yeah?

She's a lot like you
The dangerous type
She's a lot like you
Come on and hold me tight

She's a lot like you
The dangerous type
She's a lot like you
Come on and hold me tight
Tonight
She's a lot like you
The dangerous type
She's a lot like you
Come on and hold me tight

Come on and hold me tight
