I'm feeling like you're in my mind
Every moment you let pass me by
And all I need is a peace of mind
'cause baby I won't sleep tonight

I'm feeling like you're in my mind
Every moment you let pass me by
And all I need is a peace of mind
'cause baby I won't sleep tonight

We'll get so high tonight
Just you and I
We'll get so high tonight
We'll touch the sky

I can feel us giving it up
I can feel them giving it up for you
I can feel us giving it up for me

I'm feeling like you're in my mind
Every moment you let pass me by

We'll get so high tonight
Just you and I
We'll get so high tonight
We'll touch the sky
