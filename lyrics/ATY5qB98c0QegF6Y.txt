I was struck by a mighty gust of wind
Seeing you seeing him
Is this love?
Jealousy sinking in
Seeing you seeing him
Seeing you seeing him

I've been feeling so insecure
Like is it gonna come true if I say it?
Rolling blackouts in your heart
Gave you a henna tattoo
And it's fading
Gave you a henna tattoo
And it's fading

Your eyes close slow like poppies in starlight
And I feel your breath, white paper fan
You're my love, can't you see I'm your man?
Tell me
When you're seeing me you're seeing it, yeah
When you're seeing me you're seeing it

'Cause I've been feeling so insecure
Like is it gonna come true if I say it?
Rolling blackouts in your heart
Gave you a henna tattoo
And it's fading
Gave you a henna tattoo
And it's fading
And my henna tattoo
And it's fading
