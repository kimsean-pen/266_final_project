I see your ghost
It finds no rest
Leaning close
From crest of bed

"So lonely is the night, pull me in tonight"
Loneliness has...

Chest races
My best evades
Tongues will climb
And we taste escape

Own me for this night
Hold me close tonight
Loneliness has only shown me I can't let you go...

Tainted nails paint the red of tails
You're guiding gust through every trail
Writing lust through every trail

Deep screams underneath these sheets
Pull us tautly
Leave us thrown
Haunt inside me
Leave us thrown

We both belong to longings of past
Can you see the pyre below?
We both belong to longings of wrath
Can you feel the fire grow?

"Lonely is the night, pull me in tonight"
Loneliness has only shown me I can't let you go
This burning paints us wet with silhouette sweat
Own me for tonight
Hold me close tonight
Loneliness has only shown me...
Loneliness has only shown me I can't let you go
This burning paints us wet with silhouette sweat

We both belong to longings of past
Can you see the pyre below?
We both belong to longings of wrath
Can you feel the fire grow?

Loneliness has only shown me
I can't let you go
Slowly show me
How to let you go
