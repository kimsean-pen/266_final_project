I got a dirty little secret
My lover's hidden in my closet
I've got wrong feelings it's a shame
They say I'm sick I'm to blame
I've got my heart in a locket

They have something against us now
They have something against us now
You know that babe it hurts so good
I feel this love just like I should

Fire we would burn in fire
As if by loving each other
We're commiting a murder murder
Remember we're fighters
Society is the killer
But I don't care if we are together

Fire as lovers we are sinners they say
Fire, we'd be burning like liers they say
Fire, like the flame burning in my heart for you
Fire Fire

Taboo taboo taboo

I can't resist you are like a magnet
You take me to another planet
Where we don't care about prejudice
We would be in peace
I look at you and God I forget

Something against us now
They have something against us now
You know that babe it hurts so good
I feel this love just like I should

Fire we would burn in fire
As if by loving each other
We're commiting a murder murder
Remember we're fighters
Society is the killer
But I don't care if we are together

Fire as lovers we are sinners they say
Fire, we'd be burning like liers they say
Fire, like the flame burning in my heart for you
Fire

Under my skin
You are the sweetest tattoo
I'm gonna embrace my sin
I don't care if I'm a fool
Taking one on the chin
I'm gonna fight for you
Physically there's electiricty
Can't repress I confeses you posses me
Burning in the

Fire burning in the fire they say
Fire as lovers we are sinners they say
Fire, we'd be burning like liers they say
Fire, like the flame burning in my heart for you
Fire Fire fire

Taboo taboo taboo oh
