First I saw you standing there,
Eyes so wide beneath your hair,
Cold warm blacker than the sun
Syour head like stronger strong.

Stood like soldiers in the line
Heard the bells of midnight train.
We turn great walls to fields of green
The only faith that we could scream

It's while you're still young
Find your heart and find your soul.
Now where have you gone?

No matter where you're going and no matter where you've been
You never need anybody else's call now
I never met no one like you, never met no one like you
Never met no one like you, don't bring me down.

There's a dream that haunts my mind
Wild black horses having fun,
Kind of free I've never been,
The kind of beast I've never seen.

Why do all things end in pain?
I called the ghosts and asked their names.
Is that love you're running from?
If you lead, then I will come.

(Pre-)
And while you're still young
Find your heart and find your soul.
Now where have you go?

No matter where you're going and no matter where you've been
You never need anybody else's call now
I never met no one like you, never met no one like you
Never met no one like you, don't bring me down.

Basta, de cuentos, es tiempo de lo nuestro,
tengo, tu alma, bien metida dentro.
Basta, de cuentos, es tiempo de lo nuestro,
tengo, tu alma, bien metida dentro.

And while you're still young
Find your heart and find your soul.
And while you're still young
Find your heart and find your soul.
And while you're still young
Find your heart and find your soul.
Now where have you go?

No matter where you're going and no matter where you've been
You never need anybody else's call now
I never met no one like you, never met no one like you
Never met no one like you, don't bring me down.
