I feel fine
Now the rain has gone and the sun has come to shine
Nothing can get me down today
Head over heels
Got my mind made up as I'm driving through the fields
Nothing can get me down again

Catch me if you can
I've gotta make a get away

As the sun goes down, waking up my dreams
And in my mind you're with me once again
Out of my heart, into your head
And inside my heart there's a place for you
And in my mind I'm with you once again
Out of my heart, into your head

Chasing the sun
Trying to get away
From the rain that's gonna come
Hope I make it all the way

I'm lost in a crowd
Trying to find my way
But the rain keeps falling down
Doesn't matter anyway

Catch me if you can
I've gotta make a getaway

As the sun goes down, waking up my dreams
And in my mind you're with me once again
Out of my heart, into your head
And inside my heart there's a place for you
And in my mind I'm with you once again
Out of my heart, into your head

Take a look at the sky
Feel the sunshine
In your heart
In your head
In your own time

As the sun goes down, waking up my dreams
And in my mind you're with me once again
Out of my heart, into your head
And inside my heart there's a place for you
And in my mind I'm with you once again
Out of my heart, into your head

Out of my heart, into your head
Out of my heart, into your head
