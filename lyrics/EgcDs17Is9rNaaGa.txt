Your Mine
And I want you to know
That every second minute of, of the day
Can't lie
I could picture being with you
'Till you take my last breath away
I'll be there, when you wake in the morning
Lay in the evening
I'll be right there
When you say you really need me, yeah
I'm laying stop for the long rhyme, yeah
So, give me all of you
And I'll give you all of me
Never thought I'd find somebody
I'll do anything
To keep around,
Me, a while now
Keep around,
Me, a while
'Till I Found You
Oooohhh (Yeah)
'Till I Found You
I'm losing my mind, down, then I found one
Then I Found You

So fine
I swear I'd do some time
If it meant just while we never fade away
And All night
I could look into your eyes
While the moonlight complement your face
I'll be there, when you wake in the morning
Lay in the evening
I'll be right there
When you say you really need me, yeah
I'm laying stop for the long rhyme, yeah
So, give me all of you
And I'll give you all of me
Never thought I'd find somebody
I'll do anything
To keep around
Me, a while now
Keep around
Me, a while
'Till I Found You
Oooohhh (Yeah)
'Till I Found You
I'm losing my mind, down, then I found one
Then I Found You

I Found You
I Found You
I Found You (I Found you)
I Found You
I Found You
I Found You (I Found you)

So, give me all of you
And I'll give you all of me
Never thought I'd find somebody
I'll do anything
To keep around
Me, a while now
Keep around
Me, a while
And even for a second
If you think my mind will change
You crazy there's no way that I will let you slip away
I'll keep you 'round
Me, a while now
Keep it 'round
Me, a while
'Cause I Found You
Oooohhh (Yeah)
'Cause I Found You
I'm losing my mind, down, then I found one
Then I Found You
