If I told you that it wasn't easy
If I told you now would you believe me

Now if I told you that it wasn't easy
If I told you now would you believe me
I couldn't convince you if I tried
You weren't around all the times that I cried
I was crying, if I told you

If I told you, if I told you
If I told you, if I told you
If I told you, if I told you

If I told you, if I told you
If I told you, if I told you
If I told you
