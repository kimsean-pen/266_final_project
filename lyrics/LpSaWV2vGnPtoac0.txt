They drag me underground, the lights are slowly fading
The world I thought I knew I never knew at all
The dead don't make a sound unless you're chasing rainbows
And then they scream your name, clawing at the gates

So pull me out and hold me down
Let's find a way to lose ourselves

Take me to the sun, I feel I'm chasing rainbows
And now I'm lost and I'm alone, waiting for a chance to
Sink my teeth into another desperation
Now into your lonely paradise

Are we just dreaming in the city that never sleeps?
'Cause I can't be seeing what my eyes tell me
Am I just dreaming? This can't be in my veins
Everything I ever knew will never be the same

So chew me up and spit me out
Let's find a way to save ourselves
So pull me out and hold me down
Let's find a way to lose ourselves

Take me to the sun, I feel I'm chasing rainbows
And now I'm lost and I'm alone, waiting for a chance to
Sink my teeth into another desperation
Now into your lonely paradise

And now I feel it
Yeah, I feel it in my blood
I can't fight this anymore
I've given up
I've given up

Take me to the sun, I feel I'm chasing rainbows
And now I'm lost and I'm alone, waiting for a chance to
Sink my teeth into another desperation
Now into your lonely paradise

Take me to the sun, I feel I'm chasing rainbows
And now I'm lost and I'm alone, waiting for a chance to
Sink my teeth into another desperation
Now into your lonely paradise, yeah
