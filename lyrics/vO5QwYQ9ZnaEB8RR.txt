I don't live today
Not in this world we see this way
I don't cheat a game
Not in this field we have to play

"Dear, dear land, I fought for thee
Brought thee peace and victory"

Go on cowards, go on bastards
I don't care no more
All is worse now, all is darker
I can't breathe this air

"Dear, dear land, I fought for thee
Brought thee peace and victory"

Bloody wires, clockwork soul
What choice is left for me?
The Earth is dying, go on humans
My pain has no gain

"Dear, dear land, I fought for thee
Brought thee peace and victory"
