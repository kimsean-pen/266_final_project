There's a boy with his head
Pressed up to the window
Of a bus heading out of town
In his breath on the glass
He draws with his finger
A map of the roads they go down
Circles of street lights
Are the only signal
That there's people out there in the black
He waves goodbye, to the town he grew up in
He knows that he'll never come back

The night outside is five below
His heart is pumping blood
On his lips a perfect smile
His eyes begin to flood

Because tonight's the kind of night
Where everything could change
Tonight's the kind of night
Where everything could change

The rumble strip clack
And the rattling frame
Beat out a pulse on his head
The engine hums, a humble tune
A melody of rubber and lead
Under lamp light glow
And paradise stars
An infinity of dancing white light
He sees that his debt
Is to experience only
And not to those who'd plan out his life

The night outside is five below
The moon is in the sky
His heart is full of perfect joy
He whispers his goodbye

Because tonight's the kind of night
Where everything could change
Tonight's the kind of night
Where everything could change

And tonight he's not gonna come back home
Oh tonight he's not gonna come back home
Oh tonight he's not gonna come back home
Ohhh
Ohhh

Oh tonight's the kind of night
Where everything could change
Tonight's the kind of night
Where everything could change
Tonight's the kind of night
Where everything could change
Tonight's the kind of night
Where everything could change
