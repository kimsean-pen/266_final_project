Everything you see, everything you see
Can be measured, weighed, or gauged
Just like the one's who will keep you company
All of the things that you'll ever be
All of the things that you'll ever be

When all the kids count Hallelujahs
We're seven miles high
Climbing up laser beams
That light the electric seas

All the kids are the rubber souls
The kids are just fine
Kids are just fine
Kids are just fine

There's nothing you can do
Nothing to know that you always knew
So we'll all live on and just celebrate the end
With all of the things that have come to pass
All of the things that have come to pass
All of the things that have come to pass

When all the kids count Hallelujahs
We're seven miles high
Climbing up laser beams
That light the electric seas

All the kids are the rubber souls
The kids are just fine
Kids are just fine
Kids are just fine

All the castles they command
They'll come sink their teeth in
And all the waves are crashing down
We'll just sink our toes in

When all the kids count Hallelujahs
We're seven miles high
Climbing up laser beams
That light the electric seas

All the kids are the rubber souls
The kids are just fine
Kids are just fine
Kids are just fine

But the kids are just fine
Kids are just fine
Kids are just fine

The kids are just fine
Kids are just fine
Kids are just fine
