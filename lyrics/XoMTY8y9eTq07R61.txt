Meltin' like a sundae
Burning in my eyes
Peelin' like a sunburn
Microwave my smile

Meltin' like a sundae
Monday you'll hate me
Hurts just like a sunburn
Burns until it bleeds

I can see myself bein' with yourself
When the summer buzz starts wearin' off
I can see myself bein' with yourself
If the summer buzz would just wear off
