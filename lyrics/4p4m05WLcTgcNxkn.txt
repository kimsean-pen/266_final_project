I know it's been a long time comin'
Since I saw your face
It's been so long since we're together
In the back seat of your car

Ooo, oh
You used to be my girl
Hold me close 'cause I remember
How could I forget

No erasin'
I've felt this once before
No erasin'
No runnin' anymore
My soul's burnin'
Just like it was before
No erasin'
Our love just won't let go
Oh...

Summer nights in sweet surrender
Underneath the stars
One more time we're here together
In the back seat of your car

You used to be my girl
Hold me close 'cause I remember
How could I forget

No erasin'
I've felt this once before
No erasin'
No runnin' anymore
My soul's burnin'
Just like it was before
No erasin'
Our love just won't let go
Oh...

Told you of my love today
Rain comin' down
You laughed with me and sheltered me and
(Turned me on)
You won't see me, you won't see how
(You done me wrong)
You done me wrong, and you won't try

No erasin'
I felt this once before
No erasin'
No runnin' anymore
My soul's burnin'
Just like it was before
No erasin'
This love won't let go

I told you of my love today
Rain comin' down
You laughed with me and sheltered me and
Turned me on
