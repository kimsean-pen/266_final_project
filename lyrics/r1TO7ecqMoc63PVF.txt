A person that can't think and do
I'm not one of them, no I ain't
I'm not one of them, no I ain't
I was totally wrong yeah
Stop thinking
I'm right, yes I am
Stop thinking
I'm right, yes I am
Think over
As if you are possessed by something

I thought I had it, but I wsd wrong man
I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere
So I was wrong man

A person that can't think and do
I'm not one of them, no I ain't
I'm not one of them, no I ain't
I was totally wrong yeah
Stop thinking
I'm right, yes I am
Stop thinking
I'm right, yes I am
Think again carefully
As if you are haunted

I thought [I thought] I could do it
Is it too late now?

Ah
Reality tells that myself now can not do anything
I can't do anything
Ah
But I wanna get off to a start
Just gotta take yourself in and move on
I want to make a start

It isn't easy to take in yourself that can not do anything
Have faith to make the right decision, you moron!

Ah
Now is the start line
Take in your shitty self along with your tears on your face
There are visions you can see once you begin a new start
There are things you can do once you start new

Get down to zero, right now
Accept your inability
Take down your past self
Do you have the guts
Get down to zero, right now
Accept your inability
Take down your past self
Do you have the guts to restart again?
