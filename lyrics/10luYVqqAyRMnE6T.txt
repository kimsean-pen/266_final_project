Yeah
We've known each other
For a long long time
But I never really noticed
All the magic in your eyes
I've been around you
A thousand times before
And you've always been a friend to me
But now I'm wanting more

I must have been so blind (Oh-ho-oh)
I never realized
You're the one that's right for me
All the while I couldn't see
And now I feel so strange
I'll never be the same
Going 'round and 'round in circles
And I don't know what to do
'Cause baby

I've been thinking about you (Oh, yeah)
In the most peculiar way
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love with you

There's no explaining how I feel inside
I'm going through a transformation
That's so hard for me to hide
I had a revelation that
Finally opened my eyes
The one I spent a lifetime searching for
Was right here all the time
I was oblivious so very out of touch
All the while I couldn't see
You're the one that's right for me
And now my world has changed (Oh-ho-oh)
I'll never be the same
Going 'round and 'round in circles
And it's all because of you
Sweet baby

I've been thinking about you (Oh-ho-oh)
In the most peculiar way
(In the most peculiar way)
I've been thinking about you (got you on my mind)
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love with you

I've been thinking about you (Baby, baby)
In the most peculiar way
(In the most peculiar way)
I've been thinking about you (got you on my mind)
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love with you

Don't you know
That you're blowing my mind (my mind)
What you do to me (No, no)
I can't describe
Baby I can't hold back anymore
I just can't conceal it
You're the one I really adore-oo-oo-oo-oo-re (Whoo-hoow)

I've been thinking about you (Oh-ho-oh)
In the most peculiar way
(In the most peculiar way)
I've been thinking about you (Well, I got you on my mind)
In the most peculiar way
(In the most peculiar way)
I've been thinking about you (I've been
thinking, thinking, thinking about you)
In the most peculiar way
I've been thinking about you (I've been
thinking, thinking, thinking about you)
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love with you
I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar way

I've been thinking about you (Oh)
It's unbelievable to me (Oh)
But suddenly I think (Oh)
I'm falling-falling in love with you
In the most peculiar way
(In the most peculiar way)
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think, yeah (Oh)
