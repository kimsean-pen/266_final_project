I think I'd be better off alone
Without you, without you
Without you, without you
I don't mind when I sleep all alone
Without you, without you
Without you, without you
I think I'd be better off alone
Without you, without you
Without you, without you
I don't mind when I sleep all alone
Without you, without you
Without you, without you

I think I found the antidote
I think I found another road
I think I found some fucking hope, nope
I think I'm tryna find a way
To rid of all these darker days
But my mind's trapped inside a maze
So I'll run so far from these shadows
Makeshift but my heart's still fragile
I'd drown but the water's too shallow
My heads still caught in the gallows
Your kiss is my remedy
I fall to the ground so desperately
Baby I know that you're mad at me
Filling all the voids like cavities

I think I'd be better off alone
Without you, without you
Without you, without you
I don't mind when I sleep all alone
Without you, without you
Without you, without you
I think I'd be better off alone
Without you, without you
Without you, without you
I don't mind when I sleep all alone
Without you, without you
Without you, without you

I guess this feeling lasts forever
I guess we'll never be together
You're colder than i can remember
But the ice is melting quickly
I'm still wishing that you'd miss me
But you're gone and I never could replace you
Mistraced new face but it ain't you
Rebuilding the forts that I made you
No love but my hearts tryna breakthrough
My chest cause its caving in
I dwell in a cell in a realm of sin
Six shots to the face of rum & gin
I'm dead in the head so I guess you win

I think I'd be better off alone
Without you, without you
Without you, without you
I don't mind when I sleep all alone
Without you, without you
Without you, without you

I think I'd be better off alone
Better off alone
Better off alone
I don't mind when I sleep all alone
I sleep all alone
Without you, without you
