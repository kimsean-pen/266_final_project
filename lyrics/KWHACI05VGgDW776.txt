I know, I know we're lost
I know, I know we're lost
I can't help myself when we drive
Oh, don't hold us back, this midnight drive
You see the stars are out tonight
You see the stars are out tonight
I know, I know we're lost
I know, I know we're lost
I can't help myself when we drive
Oh, don't hold us back, this midnight drive
You see the stars are out tonight
You see the stars are out tonight
