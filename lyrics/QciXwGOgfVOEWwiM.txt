I've been dreaming lately about you
I wish you never went away
Wanna go back to New Year's Day
I've been getting so emotional
No longer feel you next to me
I'm swimming in these memories

And every time I close my eyes it's you and me
I feel your energy in all these lucid dreams
I really wanted you to stay
Ever since you went away

I've been walking down this lonely road
And lost about which way to go
It's something that I can't control
I found that thing that reminds me of you
I guess I gotta let it go
But I'll never let you go

And every time I close my eyes it's you and me
I feel your energy in all these lucid dreams
I really wanted you to stay
Ever since you went away

Time goes slowly
You're the only
You'll come and go
Til tomorrow
I'll see you again...

And every time I close my eyes it's you and me
I feel your energy in all these lucid dreams
I really wanted you to stay
Ever since you went away

I've been dreaming bout you
Wanna let you know
Can't stop thinking bout you
Never let you go
You're my angel baby
Watching over me
I'll see you again
We'll be running free

And every time I close my eyes it's you and me
I feel your energy in all these lucid dreams
