What happened to us all?
Have we slept through it?
Taking hits off the surface
It's too hard to swallow
When their judgments are concentrated
On everything they know

Was it all enough? (No fair)
Or did it wake you up from your sleeping?

I've overheard it once
This has gone on before
It's too one and the same
When you're accounted for
We seem so far away from
These things we used to know
We seem so far away from
Everything we are

Everyone that moves around me
They're saying nothing
That makes the fight a blur
Say we're something
That no one wanted to hear
They know that everything is wrong

Was it all enough? (No fair)
Or did it wake you up from your sleeping?

I've overheard it once
This has gone on before
It's too one and the same
When you're accounted for
We seem so far away from
These things we used to know
We seem so far away from
Everything we are

All we are is golden
This won't mean a thing
All we are is golden
This won't mean a thing
