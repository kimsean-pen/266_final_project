If there's a problem then go and fix it
It's such a simple phrase but I can't grasp it
I lay awake at night
With the fear of dying if I close my eyes

What's the point of existence
With this incurable sickness
Just show me the door
Give me a place to rest

What I would give to sleep my life away
I'd never feel alone again
And yet it's still the same when I'm dreaming
Cause at the end of the day it's just me in my own head
It's just me in my own head
It's just me in my own head

I may never know
Just how deep the rabbit hole goes
Medication won't solve it
But I guess it's a solution till I find the true culprit

What's the point of existence
With this incurable sickness
Just show me the door
Give me a place to rest

What I would give to sleep my life away
I'd never feel alone again
And yet it's still the same when I'm dreaming
Cause at the end of the day it's just me in my own head

It's just me in my own head
It's just me in my own head

What I would give to sleep my life away
I'd never feel alone again
And yet it's still the same when I'm dreaming, it's just me

What I would give to sleep my life away
I'd never feel alone again
And yet it's still the same when I'm dreaming
Cause at the end of the day it's just me in my own head

It's just me in my own head
It's just me in my own head
At the end of the day it's just me
