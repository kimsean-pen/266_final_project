An Angel is always been thought
To be one of God's most precious works
I guess that's how she had u fooled
Cause she was an Angel in disguise
Hurt and pain could never come from her
So left me only to find hurt and pain involves her

But now you see your mistakes

And now u see your angel was a fake
But my love was never misplaced
See baby my love is true
And most importantly Still I Love You
(Still I Love You)

Angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
Until she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still I love you
Angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
Until she broke your heart that day

And left you in the rain
But still I love you
I found it quite strange
The way you said her name
And when you look in her eyes
I see the lust you can't deny

It's more to this than what you say
Cause in your sleep you called her name
You say she's just a friend
I knew right then cause the rain began
Angel in disguise she was

But somehow you fell for her
Until she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still I love you
Angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her

Until she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still I love you
She seemed so familiar the day that I met her
Who was she foolin' I had a clue what she was doin'

Thoughts of suspicion brought to my attention

I fell in her game I'm so lost
Please stop the rain
Angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
Until she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain

But still I love you
Angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
Until she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still I love you
And when my music stops
And when my tear drops

And when the rain ends
My heart will beat again
And when my music stops
And when my tear drops
And when the rain ends
My heart will beat agaim

Angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
Until she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still I love you
Angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
Until she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still I love you
I love you
I will never do the things she did
Take my heart and run away with it oh no
'Cause I really really love you
