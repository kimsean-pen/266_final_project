I have closed my eyes
Now I can see clearly
There is no path because consciousness has failed me
I can't begin to know
This world has turned my mind to stone

Consciousness has failed me
Consciousness has failed this world

Eternity lost
Eternity lost

Beyond stone
The endless wait to transcend
Beyond stone
The endless wait to transcend
Beyond stone
The endless wait to transcend into a consciousness
Beyond stone
The constant fall and descend into the void of time all alone

The endless wait to transcend
The constant fall and descend

We cannot open up our minds
Consciousness has failed us all
We can't begin to know
This world has turned our minds to stone

Consciousness has failed this world
Consciousness has failed this world

Beyond stone
The endless wait to transcend
Beyond stone
The endless wait to transcend
Beyond stone
The endless wait to transcend into a consciousness
Beyond stone
The constant fall and descend into the void of time all alone

Eternity lost
Eternity is lost
