I wanna be your lover,
I wanna be your friend.
I wish I could tell you I'd last till the end.
I'm in a blue haze.
A blue haze.

I wanna be a preacher,
I wanna be a king.
And now I know why everything is in
A blue haze.
A blue haze.

My friends have all left me,
Away on the breeze.
There's a crushing silence where love's a disease.
Like a fever it grips me,
Like a lover it holds.
Scared of getting older,
Scared of dying alone.
I'm in a blue haze.
A blue haze.

And I'm carried on the back of a wave of gloom.
I'm told I'll see the shore again soon.
I'm in a blue haze.
A blue haze.

I'm living in dark rooms,
Playing at God.
Staring at blank walls,
Pretending I'm not
In a blue haze.
A blue haze.

My friends have all left me,
Away on the breeze.
There's a crushing silence where love's a disease.
Like a fever it grips me,
Like a lover it holds.
Scared of getting older,
Scared of dying alone.
I'm in a blue haze.
A blue haze.
