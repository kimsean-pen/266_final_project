Diamonds on a silver platter weren't enough
And you thought about those cigarettes you burned for love
ahhh haaa
So many others tried to crack your heart
waah haaa
Weak defenses are the only things you've got
And I was blaming you
ohhhh
An ego so inflated
And red infatuation so strong
Decades overdue
ohhhhh
Regretting all the patience
I'm sorry that I waited too long
oooohhh
Sorry that I waited too long
Sorry that I waited too...
So if Jupiter is finally fading out this time
Let the fairy tales we wrote about go black and white
So many others tried to crack your heart
Weak defenses are the only things you've got
So I was blaming you
An ego so inflated
And red infatuation so strong
Decades overdue
Regretting all the patience
I'm sorry that I waited too long
Sorry that I waited too long
Too long
