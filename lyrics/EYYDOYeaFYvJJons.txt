Au revoir, auf wiedersehen
You won't see another morning
You won't see another evening
Good night

Buenos noches, oh senor
Senorita see ya later
Buenos noches, bye-bye

There are many here among us
Who feel that life is a joke
And for you we sing this final song
For you there is no hope

Sayonara suicide
Hari kari kamikaze
You won't see another evening
Goodbye

Buenos noches, oh senor
Senorita see ya later
Buenos noches, bye-bye

There are many here among us
Who feel that life is a joke
And for you we sing this final song
For you there is no hope

Bye-bye, so long, farewell
Bye-bye, so long, sayonara
Bye-bye, au revoir, auf wiedersehen

Bye-bye, so long, farewell
Bye-bye, so long, suicide
Bye-bye, so long, hari kari, kamikaze
Suicide, suicide, suicide
