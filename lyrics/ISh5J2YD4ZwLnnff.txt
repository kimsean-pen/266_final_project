Don't take for granted what i feel
Life always change
I'm afraid of being in pain
I will be brave
But don't ask me to give you any certs
This would make of me you me your slave

Too many times
I've been caged
By the promise inside

You should know
What I'm fighting for
And I still love you more
Like a bird loves his wings
Just let me hold you
You could hear through my voice
And see through my eyes
The promise inside

Yes, I've been rended, and all I need is
A quiet surrender
But I'm tense and scared instead

In my life
I've been caged
By the promise inside

You should know
What I'm fighting for
And I still love you more
Like a bird loves his wings
Just let me hold you
You could hear through my voice
And see through my eyes
The promise inside

Precious soul
Fill me with your core
Wash away my past tears

You should know
What I'm fighting for
And I still love you more
Like a bird loves his wings
Just let me hold you
You could hear through my voice
And see through my eyes
The promise inside
