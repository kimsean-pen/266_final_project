Phantoms of disorder
Move silent through our world
Unseen and veiled by chaos
Planting seeds of dissent
Assassins of peace
Enforcers of power

The smell of fear and weakness
Draws them to their prey
The kingdoms they tear down
Become the carrion on which they feed
Predators in wait
Devils in flesh

Turning dreams to black
Bring nightmares to us all
Greed is their God
And your Gods they will devour

Poisoning morals... Reigning in nations
Plotting fate... Abolishing faith
Stop at nothing... Ransom the sun
The darkness takes hold
When the Jackals come

Their war is already won
Your world will end
When the jackals come
