I never thought you'd explode through my eyes
I never ever was amused
Dear liver down on your knees
I never wanted to be alone

Good God
I'd love to...
I had to

I never though you'd implode through my mind
I always wanted to be infused
I lied psychic spy
I never wanted to be alone

Good God
I'd love to...
I had to

You are real
Sometimes
You are unreal
Ceilings peel
Sometimes

I never though that you'd explode through my eyes
I never ever was amused
I lied psychic spy
I never wanted to be alone

I'd love to...
I had to
