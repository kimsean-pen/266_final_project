Why they wanna see my spine, Mommy?
Why they wanna see my spine?
It's gonna hurt again, Mommy
Much worse than last time

Am I gonna see God, Mommy?
Am I gonna die?
It really hurts, Mommy
Am I gonna die?

Smile on, mighty Jesus
Spinal meningitis got me down
Smile on, mighty Jesus
Spinal meningitis got me down

I'm feelin' greasy, Mommy
Please don't let me die
Stinky vaseline, Mommy
Please don't let me die

Am I gonna see God, Mommy?
Am I gonna die?
It really hurts, Mommy
Am I gonna die?

Smile on, mighty Jesus
Spinal meningitis got me down
Smile on, mighty Jesus
Spinal meningitis got me down
