Limit every second left
'Til I'm off balance (Oh love)
I'm there in spirit
Each and every breath I spend
You are collecting
See it through
I would die for you

Each and every breath I spend
You are collecting
Limit every second, left
'Til I'm off balance
Each and every breath I spend

Oh my love, how I love
Take your time
How my love takes your time
Whom I love, how I love

Oh my love, how I love
Take your time
How my love takes your time
See it through
