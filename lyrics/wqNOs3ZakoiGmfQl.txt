It's in my blood, it's in my water
You tried to taint me
Taint me from the start

With that deadness in your eye
Flash your flesh
Desperate for a need to rise

With a silver crystal lung
How will you use to know how to shine?
In a place that's safe from heart
But I had been blessed with a wilder mind

You can be every little thing you want nobody to know
And you can try to drown out the street below
And you can call it love
If you want

But hold her now
I find myself awake
Waiting on the edge again

You sleep so sound with your mind made up
Drinking from your cup of broken ends

With a silver crystal lung
How will you use to know how to shine?
In a place that's safe from heart
But I had been blessed with a wilder mind

You can be every little thing you want nobody to know
And you can try to drown out the street below
And you can call it love
If you want

But I thought we believed
In an endless love
Well, I thought we believed
In an endless love
