I've got a new walk and a new point of view
A new purpose for everything I do
I got a, a new rule on me, real folks around
If you're wondering, I'm about to tell you now

See, it's the same pretty face but a brand new smile
Same Ledisi but she ain't walking, she's flying
New game, making big moves
See if love found me it can surely find you, say it

I ain't even got one sad tear left in me
All I really want is to see the whole world

Stand up tonight, take off, aye
Yeah, we celebrating life, the only way
It don't matter who you are or where you're from
If you been working hard give yourself a round of applause

Bravo, bravo, bravo, come on, clap for yourself
Bravo, bravo, bravo, yeah, yeah

There ain't a wrong time or a wrong place to flaunt
If you feel good then go on and show it off
They can say what they wanna, just let 'em try
I don't listen to 'em, baby, lemme tell you why

See, it's the same pretty woman with the brand new smile
Same Ledisi but she ain't walking, she's flying
A new game, making big moves
See if love found me it can surely find you, say it

I ain't even got one sad tear left in me
All I really want is to see the whole world

Stand up tonight, take off, aye
Yeah, we celebrating life, the only way
It don't matter who you are or where you're from
If you been working hard give yourself a round of applause

Bravo, bravo, bravo, come on, clap for yourself now
Bravo, bravo, bravo, yeah, yeah

So, ladies put your best dress on, get your hair done
Do it real big, it's a celebration
Fellas, come on, everyone
Let me hear you clap now if this is your one

I ain't even got one sad tear left in me
All I want is to see the whole world

Stand up tonight, take off, aye
Yeah, we celebrating life, the only way
It don't matter who you are or where you're from
If you been working hard give yourself a round of applause

Bravo, bravo, bravo, come on, clap for yourself now
Bravo, bravo, bravo, yeah, yeah
Bravo, bravo, bravo, give yourself a hand clap
Bravo, bravo, bravo
