They don't know I'm missing
I don't know my way around
All these doors they fit in
But I don't live on solid ground

No patience in my mind
But the voices treat me kind, oh oh
I got the shadows on my back
Don't know what it is I'm living for

Am I just another complication?
'Cause what happened to the conversation?
And I know that I can't talk, no
'Cause I've been searching for a complication

Feel the courage kick in
As I go out and paint the town
'Cause we don't know the city
So we get drunk and we fall out

'Cause I've got no patience in my mind
But the voices treat me kind, no
I've got the shadows on my back
Tell me what it is I'm living for

Am I just another complication?
'Cause what happened with the conversation?
And I know that I can't talk, no
'Cause what happened with the conversation?

Am I just another complication?
'Cause what happened to the conversation?
And I know that I can't talk, no
'Cause I've been searching for a complication
