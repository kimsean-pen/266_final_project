Heaven, all the heavens of the world
Are you looking for anything?
Heaven, with eyes bright, green
Every day my eyes are older
I grow a bit closer to you

Hearts, all the hearts of the world
I don't know how I wear a heart so much
Even when I run,
The city can't see my eyes
Under the

I play a game of tennis
Passing fires of fight

Mother, mothers of the world
All singers with eyes closed
Singer on the 5th floor
Your hands that I wait when you disappear
How could you sing
That every day I talk to you

Mister, all the misters of the world
...worry, looking for
All kind of escape

Cities, all the cities of the world
What are you wearing?
I live alone on the 5th floor
Of the apartment building

What am I looking for you?
Oh can I escape you?
