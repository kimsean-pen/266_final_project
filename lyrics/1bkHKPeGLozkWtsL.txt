I wish somebody would just sleep here over
to check I'm breathin'
To lie that everything's all right
The situation's a bit more complicated
than I make it, I feel a bit too broke to fight
Now I'm the dress that's hangin who never gets to be put on
A singer with a broken tongue
A rotten apple, a flattened cola
Everything in time
Everything has got a line
You'd like to change
But it takes some changing
Try bein' honest, I'll tell you what I really see
A car on car collision, where no on gets to make it home
A broken bodie's pieces scattered on a phantom road
You never see it comin don't ya know
I don't know what I expect to happen
A rabbit from a hat, The clock to turn it all back
The damage done but it feel no easier
Then when it started. I hate to hear that time will make...

All my anger lighter
It's hard just to hear the name
You say that you've been workin on it
I know but I still feel the same
I see it but I feel the same way
