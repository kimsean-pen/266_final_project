I know how to love
And I know who I am
Come on let me love you a little
And help me understand
Tell me bout your loss
And tell me bout your gains
I will be everything that you need in
Just one little frame

Come on let me cook for you baby
Just relax cuz I'm cleaning too
I love you like I've known you forever
I just need you to make some room
Come on let me cook for you baby
Just relax cuz I'm cleaning too
I love you like I've known you forever
I just need you to make some room
Cuz ohh honey oh darling I do love you

Can't you see? (Can't you see)
How wonderful this love could be?
If you just spend it with me
We could be! (We could be)
The happiness we both need
If you just need it with me

You can show me off
To everyone you know
You can trust that I'll act like a lady
Until you take me home
Tell me bout your loss
And tell me bout your gains
I could be everything that you need in
In just one little frame

Come on let me cook for you baby (c'mon)
Just relax cuz I'm cleaning too
I'll love you like I've known you forever
I just need you to make some room
Come on let me cook for you baby (c'mon)
Just relax cuz I'm cleaning too
I'll love you like I've known you forever
I just need you to make some room
Cuz oooo honey oooo
Oh darling I do love you

Can't you see? (Can't you see)
How wonderful this love could be?
If you just spend it with me
We could be! (We could be)
Something happy we both do need
If you just need it with me
This could be! (This could be)
Something wonderful we both do need
If you just need it with me
We could be! (We could be)
Something happy we both could be
If you just be it with me
