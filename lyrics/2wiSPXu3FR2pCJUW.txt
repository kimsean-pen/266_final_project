I wanna tell you there's a really good reason
Why I came home wasted in the middle of the night
A tiny kingdom at the bottom of the trees
Where I was always a winner and I was usually right

Oh, you can watch it when you get a bit older
But for now in the bad bits, I should cover your eyes
She painted pictures with the tips of her fingers
Sewing buttons to Bambi, tying strings to a kite

Turning into black and white
Underneath the swinging lights
Barely awake
But I still got my stripes
'cause you're the killer with the colored kite

I wanna tell you there's a really good reason
Why I came down easy, spinning threads to a throne
A tiny kingdom at the bottom of the trees
Where I was always a winner and I was barely alone

Turning into black and white
Underneath the swinging lights
Barely awake
But I still got my stripes
'cause you're the killer with the colored kite

Tangled up, tongue tied
Tell me what to do
Tangled up, tongue tied
Tell me what to do

Turning into black and white
Underneath the swinging lights
Barely awake
But I still got my stripes
'cause you're the killer with the colored kite

Turning into black and white
