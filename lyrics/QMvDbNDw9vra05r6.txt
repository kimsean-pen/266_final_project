Auxilium meum a Domino

The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures
He leadeth me beside the still waters
He restoreth my soul

He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil; For Thou art with me
Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me

Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies
Thou anoitest my head with oil; My cup runneth over
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever
