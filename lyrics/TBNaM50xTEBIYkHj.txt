911, what's your emergency?
Pull the trigger on the stick and let's go

I'm sayin' hands up, don't shoot
And no finger on the trigger ain't afraid of truth
So you wanna be in trouble till you see a motherfucker
That is only undercover that'll fuck with you
Fists up, drop the cuffs
That's the price you've gotta pay
A good or bad
Protect us, I'm no slave

Another case and acquittal
Another wife turned a widow
Woah (Hands up, don't shoot)
Woah (Hands up, don't shoot)
Another heart breaks a little
A child left in the middle
Woah (Hands up, don't shoot)
Woah (Hands up, don't shoot)
Another officer down

I see them lights flash, hit the gas
No one wants to hear the truth
So you me to intimidate you motherfucker
That has never been scared to lose
Slam brakes catch a case
A little bitch that's on patrol
The devils dance does not advance
The one in control

Another case and acquittal
Another wife turned a widow
Woah (Hands up, don't shoot)
Woah (Hands up, don't shoot)
Another heart breaks a little
A child left in the middle
Woah (Hands up, don't shoot)
Woah (Hands up, don't shoot)
Another officer down

Fuck your life get up
Pull that fucking trigger, let's go
