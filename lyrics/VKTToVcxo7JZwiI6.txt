I'm driving in circles, shoulda bought that new phone
I cant find my way to, all the places I call home
I'm (on my own)
I'm at the station pumping gas, yeah I'm taking out the trash
I'm (all alone)

And who's there? Who's there?
Since you been gone, I learned how to move on
How to be myself, I don't need nobody still
I'm doing so good, I forgot that I could
Live like this, woohh
First step, take a deep breath
You don't need a reason why

You can, you can take, take time
You can, you can walk, run, dive

Close call, you think you might fall
But all you gotta do is try
Even angels, even angels learn... to fly
Coming home and it's late night, shoulda left the lights on
I can't help but imagine, all the things that could go wrong
I'm (on my own)
I'm in the kitchen on the chair, reaching for the top shelf
I'm (all alone)
And I'm ok, I'm alright

Since you been gone, I learned how to move on
How to be myself, I don't need nobody still
I'm doing so good, I forgot that I could
Live like this, woohh
First step, take a deep breath
You don't need a reason why
You can, you can take, take time
You can, you can walk, run, dive
Close call, you think you might fall
But all you gotta do is try
Even angels, even angels learn... to fly
Everyday I'm stronger, cant get better, if it, if it don't hurt
Why? Oh I! Oh I!
See me in my next life
Cause heartbreak's a teacher, and I'll love, I'll love a little bit deeper
Why? Oh I! Oh I!

Yeah
First step, take a deep breath
You don't need a reason why
You can, you can take, take time
You can, you can walk, run, dive

Close call, you think you might fall
But all you gotta do is try
Even angels, even angels learn...
to FLY!!!!!!
FLY!!!!!!
FLY!!!!!!
FLY!!!!!!
Close call, you think you might fall
But all you gotta do is try
Even angels, even angels learn how to fly
