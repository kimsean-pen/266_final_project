Driving past homes loose
In the night you once took
How can I feel free
When all I want to be
Is by your side
In a new municipality
Open the
Past the houses and gardens
Doesn't all change things
Awaiting there for me
That's not anything like my reality
To be by your side in a new municipality
That's not anything like my reality
