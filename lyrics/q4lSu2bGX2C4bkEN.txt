I can't sing it strong enough
It's that kind of strength I just don't have
If you watch the lights change
Don't hold them hanging

You think it's easy, but you're wrong
I'm not one half of the problem
Zurich is stained and it's not my fault
Just hold me back or let me run

So what does it mean, a mistake or two
If it's the kind of mistake no one can trace
To the fountain where we sold it
And he held them hanging

You think it's easy, but you're wrong
I'm not one half of the problem
Zurich is stained and it's not my fault
Just hold me back or let me run

You think it's easy, but you're wrong
I'm not one half of the problem
Zurich is stained and it's not my fault
Just hold me back or let me run
