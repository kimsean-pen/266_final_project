Take my hand said Cleopatra
Take me to the fires to burn
Save your passion and your kinship
Take me to the flames the flames
The flames the flames

Pay my price in pearls of wisdom
Tell me stories of my fame
Scented oil on troubled water
Take my love in vain

Break the heart break the heart
Break the heart of my very soul
Cast it on the desert sand
This dance catches fire with me

Take my body clean of blame
I am the heat inside the flame
Take my body clean of shame
I am the heat inside the flame
I am the heat I am the heat

Play my song the serpent whispered
Golden skin and eyes of flame
Painted heart and painted nails
She ran her fingers down the scales

Just back from the snake dance baby
I love you when you shed your skin
Just back from the snake dance baby
Open the door lets go in

Just back from the snake dance baby
I love you when you burn me up
Just back from the snake dance baby
This dance catches fire with me

Snake dance
