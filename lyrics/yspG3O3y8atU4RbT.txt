Someone with the thing you say,

La darla da, I receive the news so small and try look in I'll understand
I can't hear and I don't know, and the . so small, until I chase the dream.

So gone and . and then make sense, .wow wow
And the lake with just strange the woman's wow wow
Wow wow, and the link with just strange woman wow wow
And I'm too bored to understand, well good I'm done,
After the wild with me

There's a play for . they walking never know just keep on .
In the green wild light I am gone,
My extra shoulder's gone
At the shoes may be have morse .
And they walked to work the sea
As the flavor to the sound of the rocking that no one ever know this people
At the green wild I am gone by extra shoulders gone
If the shoes may .
And they walked to work the sea
As the flavor to the sound of the rocking that no one ever know this people

There's a humor in the way they walk through the flower walks
That doesn't look for me,
It was just stars it's grown, its love is emotionally
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah

There's a humor in the way they walk through the flower walks
The way they walk, they way they walk away
