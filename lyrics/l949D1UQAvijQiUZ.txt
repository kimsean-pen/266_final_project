You came into the picture like a natural
You were unexpected, got me spiritual
I don't wanna say it, but maybe it was fate
And I can not contain it

And I know, and I know it's a different love
And I know, and I know that you make me better
It's a love that will keep me holding on
And I know, and I know we only get better

I came into your picture such a broken fool
A million different pieces looking back at you
Believe me when I say this, I was giving up
But now you come and save me

And I know, and I know it's a different love
And I know, and I know that you make me better
It's a love that will keep me holding on
And I know, and I know we only get better

Ohh, ay, ay, we only get better
Ohh, ay, ay, we only get better
Ohh, ay, ay, we only get better
Ohh, ay, ay, we only get better

Love can terrify, love can start a fire
Holding on tonight, we're burning like a lighter
Everything inside us burning with desire, now

And I know, and I know it's a different love
And I know, and I know that you make me better
You're enough and you keep me holding on
And I know, and I know we only get better

Ohh, ay, ay, we only get better
Ohh, ay, ay, we only get better
Ohh, ay, ay, we only get better
Ohh, ay, ay, we only get better
