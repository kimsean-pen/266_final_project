The sun shone in,
The glint in your eye,
Your beautiful face,
Your beautiful face.
I held her tight,
Close to my heart,
I didn't know it would break,
I didn't know it would break.

I don't believe there's nothing more,
It's all inside.
We always said its forever in,
This beautiful life.
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do

And I'm trying not to feel this music's for you...
and over HEY
and over HEY
and over HEY
and I'm trying not to feel this music's for you...
and over HEY
and over HEY
and over HEY

I held her tight,
Close to my heart.
I didn't know it would break.
I didn't know it would break.

I don't believe there's nothing more,
It's all inside.
We always said its forever in,
This beautiful life.

And I'm trying not to feel this music's for you,
and over HEY
and over HEY
and over HEY
and I'm trying not to feel this music's for you,
and over HEY x19

Its alright
Its alright
Its alright
Its alright
