Is this better
Tell me that's better way
I'm not afraid
I'm not gonna how from the vultures above, serpents below
We won't let me to rest, but I won't go
Yeah

Is it better to time a live another day
I'm not afraid
I'm not gonna wrong from the scars and within, burning your skin
We won't let me to rest, but I won't go
Yeah, I won't go

I wanna stand up, a hundred feet tall
'Cause fear we never lead my way
I'm ready to run, a hundred miles strong
I've never be the same

Waking the lions in me
I'm waking the lions in me
Waking the lions in me
Waking the lions in me

Burning to ash, I'll die until I'll rise again
I'm not afraid
I'm not gonna stop til' I
Break down this cage
Escape from this chance
You'll never silence my voice
No, I won't go
No, I won't go

I wanna stand up, a hundred feet tall
'Cause fear we never lead my way
I'm ready to run, a hundred miles strong
I've never be the same

Waking the lions in me
I'm waking the lions in me
Waking the lions in me
Waking the lions in me

Far way too long
I slept inside the dark
Burn now I rise
It's time to make a move

Waking the lions in me
Waking the lions in me
Waking the lions in me

I wanna stand up, a hundred feet tall
'Cause fear we never lead my way
I'm ready to run, a hundred miles strong
I've never be the same

I wanna stand up, a hundred feet tall
'Cause fear we never lead my way
I'm ready to run, a hundred miles strong
I've never be the same

Waking the lions in me
I'm waking the lions in me
Waking the lions in me
Waking the lions in me
I'm waking the lions in me
I'm waking the lions in me
