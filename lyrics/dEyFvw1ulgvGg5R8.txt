A dead issue
Don't wrestle with it
Deaf ears are sleeping
A guilty bliss
So inviting (let me in)
Nailed to the cross
I feel you
Relate to you
Accuse you

Wash away us all
Take us with the floods

(Then throughout the night)
(They were raped and executed)
(Then throughout the night)
(They were raped and executed)
Cold hearted world

Your language unheard of
The vast sound of tuning out
The rash of negativity
Is seen one sidedly
Burn away the day
The nervous
The drifting
The heaving

Wash away us all
Take us with the floods

(Then throughout the day)
(Mankind played with grenades)
(Then throughout the day)
(Mankind played with grenades)
Cold hearted world
(And at night)
(They might bait the pentagram)
(And at night)
(They might bait the pentagram)
Extinguishing the sun

Wash away man
Take him with the floods

Die...
Die...

Die...
Die...
