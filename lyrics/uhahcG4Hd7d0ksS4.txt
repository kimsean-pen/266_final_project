These walls are disappearing
And I don't seem to care
It gets larger, and larger
And there's color everywhere
Bodies are lighter than ever
Floating off the ground
Noises from the windows
But I can't hear a sound
And all of my limitations
Begin to fade away
In this place I have freedom
Is here I wish to stay
Thoughts become distant feelings
Going with the flow
I'll just sit still now
And begin by letting go
Begin by letting go
Begin by letting go
Begin by letting go

These walls are disappearing
And I don't seem to care
It gets larger, and larger
And there's color everywhere
Bodies are lighter than ever
Floating off the ground
Noises from the windows
But I can't hear a sound
And all of my limitations
Begin to fade away
In this place I have freedom
Is here I wish to stay
Thoughts become distant feelings
Going with the flow
I'll just sit still now
And begin by letting go

These walls are disappearing
And I don't seem to care
Noises from the windows
But I can't hear a sound
I can't hear a sound
I can't hear a sound
And all of my limitations
Begin to fade away
In this place I have freedom
Is here I wish to stay
Thoughts become distant feelings
Going with the flow
I'll just sit still now
And begin by letting go

These walls are disappearing
And I don't seem to care
It gets larger, and larger
And there's color everywhere
Bodies are lighter than ever
Floating off the ground
Noises from the windows
But I can't hear a sound
But I can't hear a sound
But I can't hear a sound
But I can't hear a sound
But I can't hear a sound
But I can't hear a sound...

Begin by letting go
