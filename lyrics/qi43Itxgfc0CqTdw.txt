Say you wanna get involved
Maybe you should tell your face
'Cause I don't wanna take the fall
Everytime you go insane

I can't understand you when you talk like that
Waiting on something that's never coming back
Looking for proof, but the proof's that your you
[?] Never good enough of

Ohh!
Why you wanna play me like a chump?
Won't you go and play with someone else
Why you wanna do me like that, do me like that?
Oww!
Why don't you just tell me what you want?
You don't have to play me like a chump
Why you wanna do me like that, do me like that?
Why you wanna do me like that?
Why you wanna do me like that, do me like that?

The photographs on your wall
Make you feel like you're getting older
But freedom is not a loner
I'd even sing it to you when I'm sober

How close can you get to the edge?
That's the real measure of success
You like playing Russian Roulette
With five and a half bullets

Ohh!
Why you wanna play me like a chump?
Won't you go and play with someone else
Why you wanna do me like that, do me like that?
Oww!
Why don't you just tell me what you want?
You don't have to play me like a chump
Why you wanna do me like that, do me like that?

How close can you get to the edge?
That's the real measure of success
You like playing Russian Roulette
With five and a half bullets

Ohh!
Why you wanna play me like a chump?
Won't you go and play with someone else
Why you wanna do me like that, do me like that?
Oww!
Why don't you just tell me what you want?
You don't have to play me like a chump
Why you wanna do me like that, do me like that?
Why you wanna do me like that, do me like that?
Why you wanna do me like that, do me like that?
Why you wanna do me like that, do me like that?
Why you wanna do me like that, do me like that?
