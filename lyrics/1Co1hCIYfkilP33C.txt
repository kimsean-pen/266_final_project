When we were younger
We thought everyone was on our side
Then we grew a little
And romanticized the time I saw
Flowers in your hair
Takes a boy to live
Takes a man to pretend he was there

So then we grew a little
Knew a lot
And now we demonstrated it to the cops
And all the things we said

We were self assured
It's a long road to wisdom
It's a short one to being ignored

Be in my eye
Be in my heart
By in my eye, eyeyeye
Be in my heart

So now I think that I could love you back
And I hope its not too late
'Cause youre so attractive
And the way you move
I won't close my eyes
Takes a man to live
Takes a woman to make him compromise
Be in my eye
Be in my heart
Be in my eye, eyeyeye
Be in my heart
