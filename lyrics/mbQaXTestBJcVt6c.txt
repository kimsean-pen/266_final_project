Well
This is, for my band
The ones who shared the struggle
The ones in the picture,
I sat on my sofa
My friends all went to college
I still live in my dad's house!

Thinking, about it
Although you may regret it
You said it 'cos you meant it
Always, together
A touch of cabin fever
We find out what we really feel

This girl that I'm so sick of
This girl that I'm so sick of
This girl that I'm so sick of
This girl that I'm so sick of

When I, was fifteen
I swear it looked so easy
You go out and you get paid
Cut you, an LP
You slam it on the TV
And now its just another day down
And it's just another month gone
God knows how many shows
Yeah we still keep moving on and on
Yeah well that's rock'n'roll I spose

Girl...
Girl...
This girl that I'm so sick of
This girl that I'm so sick of
This girl that I'm so sick of
This girl that I'm so sick of

Well my name is Freddy Kreuger
I've got the elm street blues
I've got a hand like a knife rack
And I die in every film!

Yeah yeah, come on and...

This girl that I'm so sick of
This girl that I'm so sick of
This girl that I'm so sick of
This girl that I don't love
