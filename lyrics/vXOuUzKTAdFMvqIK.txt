I see the place that we belong together, together.
Like we were something more.
And it felt like maybe we could last forever, forever

But you led them to our hideout,
Forced their way inside. Now
They want us to surrender, us to surrender
But I could go all night right here between their crossfire.
We'll send them up a message.
I'll send a message
Saying, "Give it up, give it up."

We've got no place to go caught up in a rodeo.
Oh, no. Please, god, tell me we're dreaming.
We've got nowhere to run, they've all got loaded guns.
Oh, no. Please, god, tell me we're dreaming

Oh, ah
Please, god, tell me we're dreaming

Wait for the dust to settle down around us, around us
And stick to what we know.
I think the air is finally safe to breathe again, to breathe again

The world is in your palm now,
So take a breath and calm down
'Cause you have been selected, you've been selected
A few will ever find out and
If you don't see why,
Well, at least you got your nest and, you've got your nest and
So live it up, live it up

We've got no place to go, caught up in a rodeo.
Oh, no. Please, god, tell me we're dreaming
We've got nowhere to run, they've all got loaded guns.
Oh, no. Please, god, tell me we're dreaming

Oh, ah
Please, god, tell me we're dreaming
Oh, ah
Please, god, tell me we're dreaming

Well, then give it up, give it up
Ohohohohohohoh
Ohohohohohohohoh
Ohohohohohohoh

But you led them to our hideout,
Forced their way inside. Now
They want us to surrender, us to surrender
But I could go all night right here between their crossfire.
We'll send them up a message.
I'll send a message
Saying, "Give it up, give it up."

We've got no place to go, caught up in a rodeo.
Oh, no. Please, god, tell me we're dreaming
We've got nowhere to run, they've all got loaded guns.

Oh, ah
Please, god, tell me we're dreaming
Oh, ah
Please, god, tell me we're dreaming
