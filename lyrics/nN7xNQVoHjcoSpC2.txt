These sentiments are second hand.
He's fighting for his heart but he is losing ground.
She's unintended, not unloved, and you're the one to keep her safe and sound.

In time, you'll see it.
Don't look down, even though they're looking down on you.

Her shoes are scuffed, she drags her feet too much.
But baby lift your face, you don't need to justify your place.

If I could show your future you would light up like the sun.
These sentiments are second hand.
She's fighting for your future but she's gaining ground.

In time, you'll see it.

Your house is built on solid ground, you'll be just fine in time.
Just see it through.

Hey Mrs. Might, I know that you believe in her.
Hey Mr. Beaten Down, you found your heart again.
In the hope that you built your house around, you gave your little light a brand new start.
