Warm winds blowing
Heating blue sky
And a road that goes forever
Been thinking 'bout it lately
Been watching some TV
Been looking all around me
At what has come to me
Been talking to my neighbour
And he agrees with me
It's all gone crazy
Well my wife returns from taking
My little girl to school
She's got beads of perspiration
As she tries to keep for cool
She says that mess it don't get no better
There's gonna come a day
Someone gonna get killed out there
And I turn to her and say
Texas she says what
Texas she says what
They got big long roads out there
Warm winds blowing
Heating blue sky
And a road that goes forever
I'm going to Texas
We got to get out of here
We got to get out of here
Well I got a little brother
Several metres high
He's built just like a quarterback
He swears he'll testify
He says he's been to Texas
And that's the only place to be
Big stakes, big girls, no touble here
That's the place for me
I'm going to Texas
I'm going to Texas
Watch me walking
Watch me walking
