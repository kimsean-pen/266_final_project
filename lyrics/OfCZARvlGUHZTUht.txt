Oh well uh, you might think I'm crazy
To hang around with you
Or maybe you think I'm lucky
To have somethin' to do

But I think that you're wild
Inside me is some child

You might think I'm foolish
Or maybe it's untrue
(You might think) You might think I'm crazy
(All I want) All I want is you

You might think it's hysterical
But I know when you're weak
You think you're in the movies
And everything's so deep

But I think that you're wild
When you flash that fragile smile

You might think it's foolish
What you put me through
(You might think) You might think I'm crazy
(All I want) All I want is you

And it was hard, so hard to take (So hard to take)
There's no escape (There's no escape)
Without a scrape (Without a scrape)
But you kept it going, till the sun fell down
You kept it, going

Oh well uh, you might think I'm delirious
The way I run you down
But somewhere, sometimes
When you're curious
I'll be back around

Oh, I think that you're wild
And so uniquely styled

You might think it's foolish
This chancy rendezvous
(You might think I'm crazy) You might think I'm crazy
(All I want is you) All I want is you, ah-oo
All I want is you (All I want is you)
All I want is you
