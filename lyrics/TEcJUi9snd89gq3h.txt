it happen so easy at the start
cause you use to been understood
and one day i caught you looking down couldn't read you like i thought i could
i never knew why you gave it all up
is that it was this something i miss
in the silences that we couldn't seem to break through
should've known mean it more than this to hold on to you

just told me that to who's got you singing again
who put that light back in your eyes
who's got you singing again
the thing you have i wish i comeback
with the right line and see through down the blind
its just the matter of time

i know, that you've been a little risk it you're not the type to let it lie
but im here count to what i still got left was in the days when you gave it all
up is that it was this something i miss
in the silences that we never seem to break through
should've known mean it more than this to hold on to you

just told me that to who's got you singing again
who put that light back in your eyes
who's got you singing again
the thing you have i wish i comeback
with the right line and see through down the blind
its just the matter of time

who's got you singing again
who put that light back in your eyes
who's got you singing again
the thing you have i wish i comeback with the right line and see through down the blind
but just the matter of time

who's got you singing again
who put that light back in your eyes
who's got you singing again
the thing you have you got it back
never seen you mourn so easy
never seen you love like that
never knew how much i was miss it
