Sought out, killed by chance, raped and slaughtered
Rockets wake me at night
I must leave the certain death
One of the few who values life

All my hope is over
In this sea I abide
Now I sink like a stone
In dark hues I confide

Put a torch to my home
The others are gone, buried
All I have lost, I miss them
Their death is in vain

Waves, take me to the truth
Will I ever be found?

Burning salt in my throat
They've come so far, as have you
A drowning at dusk, farewell

Haven't they paid enough?
They're more than a memory in my own life
Something worse than
Something worse than a slow goodbye

Died by chance
Died so far, hundred miles behind

All my hope is over
In this sea I abide
Now I sink like a stone
These waters hold my cries
No one will bury me
