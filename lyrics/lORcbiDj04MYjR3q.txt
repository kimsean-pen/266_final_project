Living in the City - By Rhys Lewis & Tobias Kuhn

I've been living in the city too long,
I've been given everything that I've got,
Been a sinner and a saint,
Crazy, and sane.
I've been living in the city too long.

I've been working my fingers to the bone,
But as quick as money comes, it all gone,
And like London in the rain,
The pleasures got pain,
I've been living in the city too long,
Too long!

And I'm just trying to find me
Some kind of life I've dreamed about.
And we're all tired and lonely,
Hoping to figure this all out.
There's a part of my soul,
That wants to let go,
Wants to just run away.
But the rest of my soul says I should stay,
I should stay!

I've been living in the city too long,
There's things that I've gained and I've lost,
But I can still count on one hand
The friends that I have,
I've been living in the city too long.
Never used to get the feeling missing out,
But there's so much going on it gets me down,
Because whichever way I turn,
It could be better or worse.
I've been living in the city too long,
Too long!

I'm just trying to find me
Some kind of life I've dreamed about,
And we're all tired and lonely,
Hoping to figure this all out.
There's a part of my soul that wants to let go,
Wants to just run away.
But the rest of my soul says I should say,
I should stay!

I've been living in the city too long,
I've been living in the city too long,
I've been living in the city too long,
I've been living in the city too long,
I've been living in the city too long.

I'm just trying to find me
Some kind of life I've dreamed about,
We're all tired and lonely
Hoping to figure this all out.
There's a part of my soul that wants to let go,
Wants to just run away.
But the rest of my soul, says I should stay!
