Don't think of things we used to do when we knew each other
Why bother?
That stupid arrow stuck inside my heart is holding no longer
... (?)

Only 'cause, that's all I can do
That's all I can do
That's all I can do
That's all I can do

I picked up all the pieces of
myself up, all the things you left behind
And nearly lost my mind
I know you didn't mean it, but I couldn't see it any other way
That day

Only 'cause, that's all I can do
That's all I can do
That's all I can do
That's all I can do

That's all I can do
That's all I can do
That's all I can do
That's all I can do

That's all I can do
That's all I can do
That's all I can do
That's all I can do

That's all I can do
That's all I can do
That's all I can do
That's all I can do
