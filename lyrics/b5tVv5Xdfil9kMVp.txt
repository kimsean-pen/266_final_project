We walk through war in the halls of dead protocols
We came so close, demands were met
That's when the rug was ripped out from under our feet
A vicious crime, cold betrayal and deceit

Then reality hits you like a stab in the back
Like a slap in the face, a premeditated attack

On and on
The battle knows no victory
On and on
Weapons high, reject defeat

Decrepit smiles shine like fire lying through their teeth
It's a memory you want to forget
From one second to another the whole world went under
The future cuts so deep, tangibility bleeds

Then reality hits you like a stab in the back
Like a slap in the face, a premeditated attack

On and on
The battle knows no victory
On and on
Weapons high, reject defeat

Weapons high!

On and on
Till the victory is dead and gone
On and on
Kill the history, the wrong side won

On, on and on!
On, on and on!

On and on
The battle knows no victory
On and on
Weapons high, don't let the history repeat

The battle knows no victory
Weapons high, reject defeat
