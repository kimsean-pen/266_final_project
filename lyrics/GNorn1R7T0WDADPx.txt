Fading lines
Mystery sign
Mirrored lives
In the end of time

And every night is a night of the good conversations
It's something in your mind and I feel like I'm ageless
And every night is a night of the good conversations
It's something in your mind and I feel like I'm ageless

Secret charms
Smoke-filled lungs
Slightly dance
Off our hands

And every night is a night of the good conversations
It's something in your mind and I feel like I'm ageless
And every night is a night of the good conversations
It's something in your mind and I feel like I'm ageless
And every night is a night of the good conversations
It's something in your mind and I feel like I'm ageless
And every night is a night of the good conversations
It's something in your mind and I feel like I'm ageless
And every night is a night of the good conversations
It's something in your mind and I feel like I'm ageless
