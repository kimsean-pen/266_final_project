I hear all the things you're saying
I know you've been misbehaving
All the people you've abandoned
Voices carry through the canyon

I know all the games you're playing
I know where your games were made in
All the herds you had your hand in
Voices carry through the canyon

Voices carry through the canyon
Voices carry through the canyon
Voices carry through the canyon
Voices carry through the canyon
