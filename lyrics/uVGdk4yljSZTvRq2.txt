Ice cap miles thaw to freedom
Set the antarctic legion
Awake limbs, to reach a sun's rays
Blood thaws throghout the unused veins

Antarcticans near the titan's base
Matterhorn's climb initiates
Mountain's highest point receive
Boards the skybarge to cross skysea

Matterhorn's children set free
From slab arise stoned priest
Hierophant sun prevails
Windship at last now sails

Glacier formate upon the ice age siege
Walk the icebergs towards the cities
Glacier formate upon the ice age siege
Rise the icebergs as war machines.
