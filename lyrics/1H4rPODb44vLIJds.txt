Forty days and nights I've spent alone
The shadow hungry angel inside of me grows cold
Bloodshed on my mind
A slave to these walls
Get away from the life sucking call
Set me free

Grant a pardon for the meddling soul
The lives of the fallen deserve to take the spirits toll

Within the asylum of a guilty fucking conscience I fell
I feel he presence of insanity creep up my spine
To lock me away in this hell

Death has made it's abode on my shoulders
It clings to the palm of my hand eternally
Within ascendance I shall relive the slaughtering
You'll sing to the dirt, praying for the break of dawn

Night will bring the presence of a
ravenous demon setting out to terrify
Soul destructive like imploding stars
There's nothing but the darkness to guide the way
(There's nothing left inside)
There's nothing left but the darkness to guide the way

Scald the inside
Fold the endless search within you
Scale the insight
For the day it lies before us
Somewhere in time...

Off in the distance we can see, shining, clear, our demise to be
We're not listening to ourselves

Somewhere in time
We welcomed in the midnight leave
But in the distance we can see, shining, clear, our demise to be
We're not listening to ourselves
