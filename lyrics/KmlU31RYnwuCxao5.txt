If I was the wife of an acrobat...
Could've had it all... Could've had it all...

Where's all the money gone? - I'm talking to you,
All up the hole in your arm is the needle,
a much better screw.
But oh, what will you do alone? Cos I have to go.
Where is this life of fun that you promised me?
Nothing here works but your works and I mean it
I have to leave
But oh, what will you do alone? Cos I have to go.

If I was the wife of an acrobat would I look like the living dead, boy?
You're on the wire and can't get back, Let's talk about the living dead
Could have had a car, could have had it all,
Could have walked in the sky but we stare at the wall.

I know where the money's gone - I know what you do
Cos I've seen the hole in your arm and the needle's a much better screw
but oh, what will you do alone? Cos I have to go.
