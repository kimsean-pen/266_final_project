Face down
Feeding into you, find the weakness
Holding it down till we kill it
Every once in awhile
I get caught in that silver lining

No one ever lives it
What's the meaning?
What's the meaning?

Somewhere, we all lost the spirit
Lost it all

So save us
Just so we know
That the bitter taste, we need it
And we forgive ourselves and leave it all

I want it now
Choke it all down till we're speechless
Keep holding your breath till I need it
Every once in a while
We all want that silver line

No one ever lives it
What's the meaning?
What's the meaning?
Somehow I know I'm not alone

So save us
Just so we know
That the bitter taste, we need it
And we forgive ourselves and leave it all

In the space that's between right and wrong
The better days deceived us
We let ourselves believe it all
And God just bites his tongue
God just bites his tongue

We chase the seconds away
Like the wind and the rain
I always loved the storm

We pray to see better days
Please God be willing

So save us
Just so we know
That the bitter taste, we need it
And we forgive ourselves and leave it all

Beneath it all between right and wrong
The better days deceived us
And we let ourselves believe it all
And God just bites his tongue
