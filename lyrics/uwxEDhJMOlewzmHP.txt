What is this
If it ain't love then it's over
Understand me when I tell you
That we just can't keep on holding on to this

Now your friends
They're all saying that I'm no good
Are you kidding, this is mental
'Cause you know what we had was broken from the start

Now we're both standing here
I'm doubled up with fear
The hardest words to drop
But this love has got to stop

Take a bow and say goodbye
Let the hours pass on by
Now you get to feel so high
It's over
It's all over now

What is this
If it ain't love then it's over
And understand that nothing lasts forever

And now I say to her
As loud as a silencer
We just can't carry on
And in the morning I'll be gone

Take a bow and say goodbye
Let the hours pass on by
Now you get to feel so high
It's over
It's all over now

Take a bow and close your eyes
For a moment fantasise
Now you get to feel like
Get to feel like
It's all over now

And tell me that I'm free
So I can see the world
No more tears, this is the end
The final curtain call

Take a bow and close your eyes
For a moment fantasise
Now you get to feel like
Get to feel like
It's all over now
It's all over now
It's all over now
