Arise
My shining beacon
A burning mass revealing nothing more
I created the sun to conceal whats behind
A destroyer of worlds

The seas increase
They will not fall again
Destructive forces annihilate the earth
Swinging the giant rock towards the stars

Upon the wrecking ball encircling the sun
Our mortal coil dissolves into the flame
The seas increase
They will not fall again

Under the ruthless
Sun you'll burn
In the fire and flame of
Your self-righteousness

Arise
My shining pillar of hate
A burning mass revealing nothing more
I created the sun to conceal whats behind
A destroyer of worlds

Abominations
In my inferno you will burn
In the fire and flame
Of your self-righteousness

Scavengers
The worlds worst disease
Like maggots laid
In the seam

Consuming all until
The corpse dissipates
This lifeless vessel exhausted
A victim of our own hate

Abominations
The destroyer of worlds is upon us now
No judgment for your failure
Just execution

A trial by fire
Annihilation of man
No judgment
Just execution.
