Feel my pain
And your whimpers of broken mind
And slow I fade
As the darkness inside you shines

I promise not to fight if you say you don't like it
I bet you can't, I bet you can't
A promise so sublime as to keep you enlightened
I bet you can't, I bet you can't
I promise not to fight if you say you don't like it

Taking and taking from the rich and the restless
Your shameless poison games
I just got to be famous
You're jaded and broken like the poor and the wretched
But time will sour milk just the same
I just got to be famous

I promise not to fight if you say you don't like it
I bet you can't, I bet you can't
A promise so sublime as to keep you enlightened
I bet you can't, I bet you can't
I promise not to fight if you say you don't like it

Well who's gonna stoke the fire?
Who's gonna stoke the fire... now?

Well who's gonna stoke the fire?
(None of them)
Who's gonna stoke the fire?
(None of them)
Who's gonna stoke the fire?
(None of them)
Who's gonna stoke the fire?

I just got to be famous

I promise not to fight if you say you don't like it
I bet you can't, I bet you can't
A promise so sublime as to keep you enlightened
I bet you can't, I bet you can't
I promise not to fight if you say you don't like it
I bet you can't, I bet you can't
I promise so sublime if you keep you enlightened

Well who's gonna stoke the fire?
(None of them)
Who's gonna stoke the fire?
(None of them)
Who's gonna stoke the fire?
(None of them)
Who's gonna stoke the fire?
