... For years I have traveled in coldness,
But my heart is warm as the darkened sun above me...
Nothing can never take away
What I've seen with these tired eyes

Face of the weeping night
And the shade of the fading light

The dawn will never rise again for my eyes
And I will never sleep again
I've lost my hope time after time
Cause the light has erased from the sky

Now when the darkness has become part of me
I got to let my shadows free
Cause I never looked behind, I never tried to find
Something that could have made me one
Now when the sorrow has taken control of me
I got to let my shadows free
Cause I never looked behind, I never tried to find
Something that could have made me one
Something that I could reach the Sun
