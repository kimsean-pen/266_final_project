The kid that worked down at the local Baskin-Robbins
Got a tattoo of a lipstick print attached above his collar
I watch him relocating pistachio to a waffle
Thinking I had lost the plot if not the passion for the novel

He asked me what I wanted. I ordered something daft
He said he liked the tattoo Alex drew me of the bats. Thanks
I like it too but modestly confess in present company my coloring is not the main event

Look at that neck. The message is immediate the guy F's chicks
I spent a lot of years making friends with cool artists
So when they drew me tattoos I could truly feel important
It's a 22 year old inside a cube of brick and mortar
Got me questioning my morals in a corny pecking order
I should give a shit less
Cherry? No. Whip? Yes

Lotta Years
Uh, Lotta Years

The girl that worked down at the local juice place
Got a head full of dread locks down to her waist
I watch her add the spinach to the ginger to the grapes
My hair was underwhelming, my juice was fucking great

Some lady orders Maca, compliments the locks
She asked how many years it took the girl to grow the crop
"It took a lot of years and then eventually I cut them, kept them, reattach them anytime I want them."

My mind's fucking blown
Future is amazing, I feel so fucking old
I bet you clone your pets and ride a hoverboard to work
I used a folding map to find the juice place in the first
These kids are running wild I'm still recovering from church
You should have seen me in the nineties I could ollie up a curb
You should have seen me in the eighties I was bumping New Edition dragging acne into Hades

Lotta Years
