I'll never bother keeping up with you
Burning the candle at both ends it's true
You know the writing's on the wall
Why do you ride to take a fall

Slow down you're moving way too fast
(Your feet don't ever touch the ground)
Slow down You know you'll never last
(You're seeking that which can't be found)
Slow down your haste is making waste
(Your feet don't ever touch the ground)
Slow down and join the human race
(You're seeking that which can't be found)

I tried to tell you time and time again
You know you'll have to pay the consequence
Now you're obsessed with such a pace
Now slow and steady wins the race

Slow down you're moving way too fast
(Your feet don't ever touch the ground)
Slow down You know you'll never last
(You're seeking that which can't be found)
Slow down your haste is making waste
(Your feet don't ever touch the ground)
Slow down and join the human race
(You're seeking that which can't be found)

You seem to turn around and round in vain
You're like the dog that tries to catch his tail
Tell me just what you're running from
One day you're here and the next you're gone

Slow down you're moving way too fast
(Your feet don't ever touch the ground)
Slow down You know you'll never last
(You're seeking that which can't be found)
Slow down your haste is making waste
(Your feet don't ever touch the ground)
Slow down and join the human race
(You're seeking that which can't be found)
