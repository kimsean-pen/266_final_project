Girl, you say you want it
And I have no trips about it
And these played-out faces around me
Want you to know where they go
But they ain't got nothing on you
To say I'd open your mouth for me
I've got you locked down like police
And no three-to-five, you're doing life, so

Please don't knock over my heart
Cause my heart is full of you
Yeah, my heart is full of you
I don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Cause my heart is full of you
Yeah, my heart is full of you

These noisy voices, phony
They say I'm not really for you
Cause I slept around before you
And I had fun, but now I am done
So put your arms around me
And I'll put away the snowflakes
And you'll be my only, only
And no three-to-five, you're doing life, so

Please don't knock over my heart
Cause my heart is full of you
Yeah, my heart is full of you
I don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Cause my heart is full of you
Yeah, my heart is full of you

After a while I fanned the fire
Then I knew that you were wild
I think that the time is now
I think that the time is now, so

Please don't knock over my heart
Cause my heart is full of you
Yeah, my heart is full of you
I don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Cause my heart is full of you
Yeah, my heart is full of you
