Incomplete
Cast in the concrete
Walk this city street
Granite sky
My machine
Built the factories
Feeds the worker bees
Get in line

Round and round and round
The wheels come down
Dreaming of the steam, the pounding sounds
Round and round and round
The wheels come down
Won't you electrify my soul
Intensify it all

Little girl
In a concrete world
Artificial hurt
In your eyes
You won't see
Any living trees
Any flower field
In my time

Round and round and round
The wheels come down
Dreaming of the steam, the pounding sounds
Round and round and round
The wheels come down
Won't you electrify my soul
Intensify it all

I like the plastic people, paper world
The silver moon, the iron sun
I'll fold you paper flowers little girl
For you'll never see a real one

Round and round and round
The wheels come down
Dreaming of the steam, the pounding sounds
Round and round and round
The wheels come down
Won't you electrify my soul
Intensify it all
