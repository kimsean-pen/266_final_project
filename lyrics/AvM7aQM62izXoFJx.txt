I can be on your brain, on your mind
I can be like a crane for your ride
Oh no, I can be, be in Paris all the time
Don't you play with me, heard you play all the time

I act pretty when I'm with my girls
And you act silly when you're with your boys
And I got problems, but I guess they're mine
And I got issues, well, I guess they're yours
And my friends try to get it, they never
Keep this for myself like whatever

And when I'm on my own
I think of ways to tell ya
But when it comes out wrong
I hope you'd understand
And when I'm all alone
I think of ways to show ya
I put it in a song
I hope you'd understand

I hope you understand

I can be like a flame in the night
I can be like the rain on your fire
No, no, I can be, I wanna yurn, I'm alive
Don't you play with me, heard you play all the time

I act pretty when I'm with my girls
And you act silly when you're with your boys
And I got problems, but I guess they're mine
And I got issues, well, I guess they're yours
And my friends try to get it, they never
Keep this for myself like whatever

And when I'm on my own
I think of ways to tell ya
But when it comes out wrong
I hope you'd understand
And when I'm all alone
I think of ways to show ya
I put it in a song
I hope you'd understand

Sometimes I see it and I wonder
Oh oh, I die but just said your number
It's hard to say why I'm so wiry
Forgive my attitude, I'm sorry
You only wanna know me better
I dismissed your shit like whatever

And when I'm on my own
I think of ways to tell ya
But when it comes out wrong
I hope you'd understand
And when I'm all alone
I think of ways to show ya
I put it in a song
I hope you'd understand
And when I'm on my own
I think of ways to tell ya
But when it comes out wrong
I hope you'd understand
And when I'm all alone
I think of ways to show ya
I put it in a song
I hope you'd understand

I hope you understand
I hope you understand
I hope you understand
