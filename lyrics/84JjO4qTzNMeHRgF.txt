Yeah
Man, this is the softest thing I ever did, but
It's about something that's pretty important to me

And that's you
And that's true
Really wish that I ain't care about you anymore
But I do
What do I do when the rap life
Make a muhfucka choose up in that fight?
Make a young couple do something sad like
Bein' broke up even though we had life.
Fuck it, I don't even know what I coulda done
Lookin' back thinkin' "That's what I shoulda done"
Wanted you back
But when the fact is I always put you second to rap
I'm not mad that you wouldn't come.
And even though I had to move, I ain't move on
Really wish you was a boo I could prove wrong.
But she knows what I'mma do with the new songs
And she know em pretty soon when ya dude on
Running the rap game, with that lane.
Always gotta be up on that train, or that plane
Ain't nobody wanna feel that pain, or that strain
Wishin' I ain't gotta get that fame
Or I'd claim you, know I'd give you my last name.
But that blame on me
Chasin' something, feelin' dumb cuz you all I need.
Hope you wait until I'm done and I'm all free
But you know I'm never knowin' when that's gon' be

And I'm sorry.

It's the hardest rule to follow (I'm thinkin' of you)
I really wish that I could call you (What can I do?)
You can find another me tomorrow
and that's the hardest pill to swallow, babe.
If I woke up and I called it quits (Cuz I'm thinkin' of you)
If today I gave up all of this (I don't know what to do)

Maybe I could get you back tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, baby.

And that's you
And that's true
Really wish that I ain't care about you anymore
But I do
What do I do when the rap life
Make a muhfucka choose up in that fight?
Make a young couple do something sad like
Bein' broke up even though we had life.
When I'm bein' dumb and stupid
Who the fuck is gonna hit me with the mothafuckin' jerk face?
Who gon' let me know to hit my mother on her birthday?
Who gon' let me know when I be shoppin' if a shirt's gay?
And when I'm on the road I be missin' that.
Always lookin' at my phone, you would give me crap.
Ever since I've been alone I've been thinkin' back
Listenin' to you auto-tune in my mic phone makin' us laugh.
You know the past was a blast but it never could last.
Pretty sad when your love got a separate path
Used to read when there's nothing to do
But it's funny
Doin' nothing's never nothing
When it's something with you.
You know I wanna still talk, even text and call
Whenever somethin' goin on I be pressin' "Moll"
Up in the phone til I press the X
Stressed the next one'll best the ex
And you'll forget, but it's best.
You the best to me girl, always bake me somethin'
And when they ripped off, you replaced my buttons.

But don't be pissed off if I hate your husband
Cuz even when I can't say "Love ya"
I love ya

It's the hardest rule to follow (I'm thinkin' of you)
I really wish that I could call you (What can I do?)
You can find another me tomorrow
and that's the hardest pill to swallow, babe.

If I woke up and I called it quits (Cuz I'm thinkin' of you)
If today I gave up all of this (I don't know what to do)

And that's the hardest pill to swallow, baby.

And that's you
And that's true
Really wish that I ain't care about you anymore

But I do
What do I do when the rap life
