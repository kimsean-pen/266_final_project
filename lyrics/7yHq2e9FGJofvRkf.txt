In the light of the day
You can hear the old ones say
Was the sound last night the wind?
Can you feel the change begin?
By the fall of the snow
A single soul will go
With footsteps on the white
There's an unholy light

There's a hole in the sky
Something evil's passing by
What's to come
When the siren calls you go
To run with the wolf

When the world makes a turn
The eyes of one will learn
That a sound just like the wind
Only makes the change begin
By the end of the rain
The feeling's passed again
From the things that snap and bite
An unholy light

There's a hole in the sky
Something evil's passing by
What's to come
When the siren calls you go
To run with the wolf

There's a break in the ground
Like the swirling waters
Angry as they pull you down
When the siren calls you go, yeah
To run with the wolf
Run with the wolf

There's a hole in the sky
Something evil is passing by
What's to come
When the siren calls you go yeah
To run with the wolf
Run with the wolf

Like a beast in a field
You know his fate is sealed
He runs with the wolf, oh
Run with the wolf

Sees his mate
He knows it's late
There he goes
To run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run with the wolf
Run with the wolf
Run with the wolf
Run with the wolf

Run, run, run
There we go
Run, run, run, run
Run with the wolf
