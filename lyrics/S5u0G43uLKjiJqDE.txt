You had a rough week
You left your boy because he cheats
You stay up late and drink yourself into a daze
You blame yourself if you only had a bit more wealth
You'd go on a holiday
into the beach, wash it away
away, away
wash it all away
away, away (wash it all away)
tell me is it love or luster
be honest, be honest
'cause i'm losing your trust
you promised, you promised
tell me is it love or lust
be honest, be honest
'cause i'm losing your trust
so get on it, oh you're off it
oh!
he misses your touch
what a great excuse for falling in love
if he tries hard enough
eventually, you're gonna crush
he's never come clean
it's not good for your self esteem
he'll do it again
and it'll probably be with your bestfriend
oh well, oh well
it'll probably be with your bestfriend
oh well, oh well
it'll probably be with your best friend
tell me is it love or luster
be honest, be honest
'cause i'm losing your trust
you promised, you promised
tell me is it love or lust
be honest, be honest
because im losing your trust
so get on it, you're off it
Oh!
you've had a rough week
you left your boy because he cheats
you stay up late
and drink yourself into a daze
tell me is it love or luster
be honest, be honest
'cause i'm losing your trust
you promised, you promised
tell me is it love or lust
be honest, you're off it
oh!
wash it all away
wash it all away
wash it all away, away, away
