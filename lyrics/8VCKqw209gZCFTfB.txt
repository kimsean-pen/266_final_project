Out of tune boys, out of tune boys
Signposts to the sun
Single file boys, single file boys
Signposts to the sun
High as you can go
Lennon to Munroe
Claw their way to the stars
High as you can go
Lennon to Munroe
Clawed their way to the stars
I think they knew.
And I don't care who you are
Just sign the line
And away you fly.
Unexpectedly rejected
Safety for the few
Same excuses resurrected
None of them are true.
High as you can go
Grace Kelly to Garbo
Clawed their way to the stars
High as you can go
Grace Kelly to Garbo
Clawed their way to the stars
I think they knew.
No I don't care who you are
Just sign the line and away you fly.
Take a chance and join the dance
And you can make the sound
Take a chance and join the dance
And we can go to ground
Go to ground.
And I don't care who you are
Just sign the line and away you fly.
