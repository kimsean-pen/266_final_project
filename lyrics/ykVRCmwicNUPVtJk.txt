What if I told you my soul was cruel?
And what if I told you there was nothing you could do
My callous hints you refused to take
When I was just waiting for someone to give me a break
And suffice, make me make my time.
Sacrifice, your sanity and your time to be what I need.
What I told you my soul was not for you?
And what I told you there was nothing I can do.
Cause there's nothing there just between the sheets
And oh the perpetual calls, you're making me dread the drive back east
To say the least, I knew you wouldn't suffice.
Make me make my time.
Sacrifice, your sanity and your time to be what I need.
Make me meet my prime.
You look so nice, that'll never satisfy.
Cause you don't make me feel a thing.
And I want to feel something.
Cause you don't make me feel a thing.
Cause I don't feel a thing.
What if I told you my soul was cruel.
And what if told you there was nothing you could do.
But suffice, make me make my time.
Sacrifice, your sanity and your time to be what I need.
Make me make my time.
You look so nice, that'll never satisfy.
