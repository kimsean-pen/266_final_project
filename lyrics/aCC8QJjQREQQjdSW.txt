[Verse 1]
When I want to
You know I got to shout it out
So proceed I just want to careen
But I got to wait it out
When it feels right
You know I got to shout it out
Take a shot
And it's not what I thought
Maybe I'll just take a bow

Even though
Your heart seems gold
Oooh it's so cold

If it's just business then I really wanna know
If it's just business then I really wanna know
If it's just business then I really wanna know

I'll take the next car
Go ahead and ride it out
You're in my lane
But it's not quite the same
I can't help but shout it out
To the next bar
You don't show so I sweat it out
I'm outta my league
But I can't make a scene
I probably should just take it out

Even though
Your heart seems gold
Oooh it's so cold

If it's just business then I really wanna know
If it's just business then I really wanna know
If it's just business then I really wanna know

Even though
Your heart seems gold
Oooh it's so cold

If it's just business then I really wanna know
If it's just business then I really wanna know
If it's just business then I really wanna know
