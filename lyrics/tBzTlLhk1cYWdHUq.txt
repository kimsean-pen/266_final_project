Another day I call and never speak
And you would say nothing's changed at all
And I can't feel much hope for anything
If I won't be there to catch you if you fall

Again (oh again)
It seems we meet (meet and mend)
In the spaces (spaces safe)
In between (between intent)
We always say (always say too much)
Won't be long (long been gone)
Oh, but something's always wrong

Another game of putting things aside
As if we'll come back to them sometime
A brace of hopes and pride of innocence
And you would say something has gone wrong

Oh again (again we fail)
Seems we meet (meet and mend)
In the spaces (wend our way)
In between (between intent)
We always say (always say too much)
Won't be long (long been gone)
Oh but something's always wrong

And again (again we fail)
Seems we meet (make amends)
In the spaces (wend our way)
In between (between each end)
We always say (looking back)
Won't be long (moving on)
Oh, but something's always wrong
Something's always wrong
Something's always wrong
