Dreams, I have dreams
When I'm awake, when I'm asleep
And you, you are in my dreams
You're underneath my skin, how am I so weak?

And now, in my dreams
I can feel the wait, I can just come clean
I keep it to myself, I know what it means
I can't have you but I have dreams

How long can you hold your breath?
Can you count to ten, can you let it pass?
And keep, can you keep it in?
And keep it behind lashes, can you make it last?

And now, in my dreams
I can feel the way, I can just come clean
I keep it to myself, I know what it means
I can't have you but I have dreams
And I have dreams, I have dreams

Mind, can you read my mind?
Has it come undone, am I showin' signs?

And now in my dreams
I can feel the wait, I can just come clean
I keep it to myself, I know what it means
I can't have you but I have dreams
And I have dreams, I have, I have, I have dreams
