Sever every tie, untangle every lie
Your words don't mean anything anymore no
Never satisfied but I'll compromise myself for you
Anymore anymore no
Your so complicated I'm so over it

Don't tell me that everything is all right
(I know you know)
Don't tell me how to live my life
I'm breaking through tonight

You can crash and burn this time
As I leave it all behind
These scars won't breath anymore anymore no
Sounds like a goodbye
So bury you alive
Your six feet down getting lower
Going no where
It's not complicated
I'm just over it

Don't tell me that everything is all right
(I know you know)
Don't tell me how to live my life
I'm breaking through tonight

Take this, hate this
You can feel the fire
Suffocating from your new life
Through escaping say good night
Darkness taking all your life

Don't tell me that everything is all right
(I know you know)
Don't tell me how to live my live
I'm breaking through tonight
(Don't tell me)
I'm breaking through tonight
(Don't tell me)
I'm breaking through tonight
