See the curtains hanging in the window
In the evening on a Friday night
A little light shining through the window
Lets me know that everything's all right

Summer breeze, makes me feel fine
Blowing through my mind
Summer breeze, make me feel fine
Blowing through my, makin' me feel all right
Making me feel, making me feel fine
Makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind

Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom
July is dressed up and playing her tune
And when I come home, from a hard day's work
And you're waitin' there, yes you're waitin' there without a care in the world

I see the smile awaiting in the kitchen
A food a-cooking and a place there for two
I see the arms that reach out to hold me
In the evening when the day is through

Summer breeze, makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze, make me feel fine
Blowing through my, makin' me feel all right
Making me feel, making me feel fine
Makes me feel right
Blowing through the jasmine in my
Blowin', blowin', blowin through the jasmine in my
Blowin', blowin', blowin through the jasmine in my
Blowin', blowin', blowin' through the jasmine in my
Blowin', blowin', blowin throuh the jasmine in my Blowin', blowin...
Blowin' through tge jasmine in my mind

So I walk on up to the doorstep
Through the screen and then across the floor
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowing through my mind love
Summer breeze makes me fine
Blowing yeah your makin' me all right
Makin' me feel making me feel fine
Make me feel right
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
In my mind
