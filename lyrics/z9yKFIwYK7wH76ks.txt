Less conversation
No moral obligation
To tell me how you feeling tonight, right
Minds over racin'
Visions got me shakin'
Motor station changing your mind
Mind, mind, mind

I see what's at the ending of the rat trap
Lady Jabowakee's eatin' bed bugs
The rabbit dug a hole straight through to China
So where do we go?
And where is the rabbit's hole?

I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm sinking in
I'm moving in
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away

Ol' Tom Turtles
A hustler and a cousin
His lizard like complexion ain't right
Motor city's moving
The big grizzler's groovin'
He's a number one percenter tonight

Right on
Right on
Right on
Right on

I see what's at the ending of the rat trap
Lady Jabowakee's eatin' bed bugs
The rabbit dug a hole straight through to China
So where do we go?
And where is the rabbit's hole?

I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm sinking in

Don't let the grip on this subside
Chips will only grow one shoulder at a time
The lesson of all lessons of our lives
And forget about the troubles for a time, time, time, time

I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yea
I'm feeling like I'm sinking in
I'm moving in
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away

I see what's at the ending of the rat trap
