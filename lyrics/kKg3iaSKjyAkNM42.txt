Yo, that's that Ye blood
That's that fucking crack
This that Kanye West shit blud, turn you crazy
Yeahhhh!
Nothing great about fucking Britain
Futuristic platinum five times bitch!

Crack dealer
Phone passed around like ambipur
Shotgun shells turn your face pizza
Never shot guns, just a drug dealer (hah)
Just a drug dealer
Got one song it's called drug dealer
Nothing to say but drug dealer
You're mediocre like Kate and Peter

When I show you up
Fisticuffs, show you short
Pump me full of Mountain Dew till your
limbs turn pulp and your skin turns blue
Impossible couldn't obstacle, I make it possible, cause it's what I do
Teacher said "what you gonna be when you're older?"
Drug dealer - what else can I do?

Business man I don't business man
Minding my business, got business plans
Your foundations been built on sand
Sinking sand, now you're sinking man
Your chick, she was linking man
Before she linked you she had tings in hand
Call her your princess, man but her only interest is linking man

I don't care what you think, old man sell crack for a living
Just down living
Cause she sweat it then I don't make a difference
I'm OT safe, you don't know me - safe
Nothing great about Britain, is and it isn't
Rockport jeans, patterned memories
Same situation a boy was given (yeah the boy was given)

Crack dealer

Flying saucers turned cocaine
Battered fish to Oysters all upgrade
Council house the violence what we gonna do today?
I was running from in trident cause it's always the same
Didn't do nothing, always get the blame
Lower class but my class is so fucking flames

Angry? Nah, I can't contain
Fucking punched the wall till my fucking
knuckles break, feel don Cause I'm feeling pain
Traveled the country, hundreds of trains
Hundreds of lanes, hundreds of lanes
Hundreds of people that all act the same

Think to myself something's gotta change
Think to myself something's gotta change
Think to myself something's can't change
Think to myself something's gotta change
Think to myself something's gotta budge
Think to myself something's gotta go

Trust in slow he's the chosen one
Think to myself something's gotta go
Think to myself something's can't change
Think to myself something's gotta change
Think to my- ah...

Fuck it man
Hahahaha, fuck it!
Give a fuck about the last fucking chorus
Some time mine
We're gonna make a difference in this shit man
Seriously man, this your future self talking man
