Wakin' up feelin' good and limber
When the telephone it ring
Was a bad man from California
Tellin' of a stone he'd bring

And of better days
From this town, we'd escape
If we holler loud and make our way
We'd all live one big holiday

So we listened and up the river
And recorded all the sounds
Was some shakin' and some record playin'
All the leather kids were loud
