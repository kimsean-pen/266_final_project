Three boys in a burning panzer doing nothing
Not to shove our throats in the flames
We shan't let go
Oh friend, oh foe, oh friend, oh foe

Beauty Towne
How little have we learned
Beauty Towne
The fruit that we deserve

And we had, and we had
And we had more than we could take
Three Orcs under plague of darkness
And like Egypt, we had it coming all along

I won't believe
Oh fiend, oh foe, oh fiend, folio

Beauty Towne
The hair remains the same
Hanging the rope of shame
And we tried and we failed
Not to live this way again

Beauty Towne
The hair remains the same
Hanging the rope of shame
And we tried and we failed
Not to live this way again
