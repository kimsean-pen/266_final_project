All dressed up and nowhere to go
I think i'm taking this trip alone
30 seconds til i pass
The questions you will never ask
Your regrets will haunt you
You know i never had to

But i'm saving myself from you

And did you notice anything
The changes made
Now it's safe to say
You will never change your ways

I went to your house but you weren't at home
I'm sure you coveniently shut off your phone
I don't think that i'll ever be
The person that you want of me
When all that i can think about
It's you i have to figure out

But i'm saving myself from you

And did you notice anything
The changes made
Now it's safe to say
You will never change your ways

You would give up anything
To prove your point
There's nothing left to say
You will never change your ways

But i'm saving myself from you
Yeah i'm saving myself from you

All dressed up and nowhere to go
I think i'm taking this trip alone

And did you notice anything
The changes made
Now it's safe to say
You will never change your ways

You would give up anything
To prove your point
There's nothing left to say
You will never change your ways
