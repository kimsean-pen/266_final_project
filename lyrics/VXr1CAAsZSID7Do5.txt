We are struggling, we are striving
In the search for a place to stay
There is no guarantee of surviving
We're putting ourselves in harm's way

Tell me, what's wrong with everybody today?
Suffer, losses and dealing with human fears
It is neither livable nor acceptable over years

We're all seekers
On the run for love, on the run for hope
We're all seekers
Always searching for a life worth living

We are troubling, we're disturbing
In the search for a place to stay
There is no guarantee of surviving
Dreams and reality like night and day

Tell me, what's wrong with everybody today?
Distress signal this time for all humankind
We are about to crash and burn
We are on our own, there's no return

We're all seekers
On the run for love, on the run for hope
We're all seekers
Always searching for a life worth living
We are all searching for a life worth living

They irritate, they infuriate, they inflame, they chafe
They irritate, they infuriate, they inflame, you are not alone
You are not alone
We may start to take time and take part
For what may be changed
We may start to take time and take part
Defeat inertia for a change

We're all seekers
On the run for love, on the run for hope
We're all seekers
Always searching for a life worth living
We are all searching for a life worth living
