In the far desert
On a distant blasted plain
A forgotten corner
Amid the death of all things
Not under the blinding sun
Or the cultivator's toil
Only in darkness
Does the flower take hold
It blooms at night
It blooms at night

In the old city
In abandoned shells
On a desolated edge
Amid the death of all things
Not under the scornful eye
Or the corporation's hand
Only in darkness
Does the flower take hold
It blooms at night
It blooms at night

In my own head
Near the hole where hope drains out
And fear is branded deep
Amid the death of all things
Not under law or the thoughts I had before
Only in darkness
Does the flower take hold
It blooms at night
It blooms at night

In a valley filled with flowers unseen in the dark
In a valley filled with flowers unseen in the dark

It blooms at night
It blooms at night
It blooms at night
