It's useless. I tried but to no avail,
To tell you how much I know. How much I care.
Come home.

Breathe until your lungs fail.
You can sing till you go deaf.
Everyday that you don't call her,
I can feel it. You're coming down.

I am sick.
I am horrified at everything I hear.
The youngest daughter lost her way.
Everyday repeats itself again.
The cycle of our misery, it drives us all insane.
Please come home.

The poison takes away from us
Now you're sick to death from all the drugs.

Breathe until your lungs fail.
You can sing till you go deaf.
Everyday that you don't call her,
I can feel it. You're coming down.
