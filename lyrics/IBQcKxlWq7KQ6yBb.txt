I'm feeling like we're knowing it oh
Don't know where we went, woah
Why it gotta come to this for?
Can't get caught up throwing stones at a glass house

If you look in the mirror
And I look in the mirror
Ain't nobody perfect
Ain't nobody perfect
'Cause you'll keep pointing fingers
And I'll keep pointing fingers
It's like we're throwing stones at a glass house
And it shatters

What you givin me that look for?
Baby this ain't nothin but a conversation
This love ain't fair, locked up, got me feeling like I'm on probation

I keep holding on
I need you to chase me like you chase paper
Roll with me like you roll the paper
I'm open if you open
Open if you open

I'm down, down

If you look in the mirror
And I look in the mirror
Ain't nobody perfect
Ain't nobody perfect
'Cause you'll keep pointing fingers
And I'll keep pointing fingers
It's like we're throwing stones at a glass house
And it shatters

It just shatters
It keeps shattering
Nothing matters
If it's no trust between these hard walls
And it's all built up on lies and faults

Then it shatters
Know me, squeeze me and hold me
Then it shatters
Know me, squeeze me and hold me
Then it shatters
Know me, squeeze me and hold me
Then it shatters
Know me, squeeze me and hold me

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

If you look in the mirror
And I look in the mirror
Ain't nobody perfect
Ain't nobody perfect
'Cause you'll keep pointing fingers
And I'll keep pointing fingers
It's like we're throwing stones at a glass house
And it shatters

It just shatters
It keeps shattering
Nothing matters
If it's no trust between these hard walls
And it's all built up on lies and faults

Then it shatters
Know me, squeeze me and hold me
Then it shatters
Know me, squeeze me and hold me
Then it shatters
Know me, squeeze me and hold me
Then it shatters
Know me, squeeze me and hold me
