Get up, get out
Move 'em, move 'em, there's no doubt
I'm all wrong, you're right
It's all the same with you

I'm too thin, too fat
You ask why
So why, so why?
So why, so why?

On and on
And on and on
On and on
And on and on

Don't wanna grow up
I wanna get out
Hey, take me away
I want to shout out
Take me away, away
Away, away, away

Round and round, here we go again
Same old start, same old end
Turn my head and turn back again
Same old stuff, never ends

Do this, do that
Can't deal, can't deal with that
I tune in, tune out
I've heard it all before

Hello, goodbye
Never asking me why
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye

On and on
And on and on
On and on
And on and on

Don't wanna grow up
I wanna get out
Hey, take me away
I want to shout out
Take me away, away
Away, away, away

Don't wanna grow up
I wanna get out
Hey, take me away
I want to shout out
Take me away, away
Away, away, away

Don't wanna grow up
I wanna get out
Hey, take me away
I want to shout out
Take me away, away
Away, away, away
Round and round, here we go again
Same old story, the same old end
Turn my head and turn back again
Same old stuff, never ends
