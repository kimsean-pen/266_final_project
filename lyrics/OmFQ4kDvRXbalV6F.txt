O-O, Let's start the war damn sexy
O-O, And fuck what good girls may say
I say, l open a bottle in taxi
And I'm ready to be under you big time

You know I beat your gun
You know I beat your gun
You know I beat your gun
And I'll be done

You know I beat your gun
You know I beat your gun
You know I beat your gun
And I'll be done
And I'll be done

O-O, I wanna fight with you so bad
O-O, And break my hand on your ass
I say, throw me on the dancefloor like on the bed
And I'm ready to be under you big time

You know I beat your gun
You know I beat your gun
You know I beat your gun
And I'll be done
And I'll be done

You know I beat your gun
You know I beat your gun
You know I beat your gun
And I'll be done

You know I beat your gun
You know I beat your gun
You know I beat your gun
And I'll be done
And I'll be done
