This is only a rumour I heard
So I don't know how much truth it has
But it seems to have somethin' to do
With the theory of unified fields
The theory holds the key
To all the world's mysteries, says Mr. Lamue
You're not me, and I'm not you
But it could just be that we're the same
We all talk too much
We all think too much
Rap, rap, everybody rap
Rap, rap, do you think you can rap
Rap, rap, everybody rap
Rap, rap, do you dig, I dig rap
Rap, rap, everybody rap
Rap, rap, do you think you can rap
Rap, rap, everybody rap
Rap, rap, do you dig, I dig rap
Let's talk about phenomena
Did you know that there are corpuscles
We all emit through a force field
By which we can communication
Except we all think
And talk and sing so loud
We don't notice them
We're headed in the same direction
Don't you know
Neither down nor up
We all talk too much
We all think too much
Rap, rap, everybody rap
Rap, rap, do you think you can rap
Rap, rap, everybody rap
Rap, rap, do you dig, I dig rap
Rap, rap, everybody rap
Rap, rap, do you think you can rap
Rap, rap, everybody rap
Rap, rap, do you dig, I dig rap
There's just one thing
I'd like to say's
I'm not in the best condition
I can see it up ahead
But it's like
A heat haze, just out or reach
With Maitreya the saviour
Waiting there on the other side
The enormous egg
That holds us all
In like mother's womb
We all talk too much
We all think too much
Rap, rap, everybody rap
Rap, rap, do you think you can rap
Rap, rap, everybody rap
Rap, rap, do you dig, I dig rap
Rap, rap, everybody rap
Rap, rap, do you think you can rap
Rap, rap, everybody rap
Rap, rap, do you dig, I dig rap
