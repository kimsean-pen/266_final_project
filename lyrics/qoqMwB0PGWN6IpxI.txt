We struggle to our feet
We all yearn to be free
We fight yet we're weak
We all call out our grieve
This goddamn life is our disease
But we can't always fucking weep
We can always turn the tide
We can all stand up and sing: "Never alone"

We fight together, not alone
We fight together, not alone
No matter where our bodies roam
This place is now what we call home, never alone

Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
We shed our tears and fight our fears
As we are one, the lonely hearts
Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
We shed our tears and fight our fears
As we are one, the lonely hearts

We sink, or we swim
When we're drowning in our grief
But we can't ever lose hope
We have to stay afloat
We struggle to breathe
We can win if we stand and believe
We are lost on our own
But we'll find our way home
We can always turn the tide
And we can all stand up and fight, never alone

We fight together, not alone
We fight together, not alone
No matter where our bodies roam
This place is now what we call home, we are never, ever alone

Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
We shed our tears and fight our fears
As we are one, the lonely hearts
Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
We shed our tears and fight our fears
As we are one, the lonely hearts

We are not lost here together
We are not lost anymore
We'll turn the tide, we'll calm the storm
We are ready for war

We are ready for war
We are ready for war
We are not lost here together
We are not lost anymore

Never alone, never apart
'Cause we're the lonely hearts
Three, two, one, go

Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
We shed our tears and fight our fears
As we are one, the lonely hearts
Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
We shed our tears and fight our fears
As we are one, the lonely hearts

"Hello? Are you there? Listening?
I'm just trying to get in touch, man
I've been so fucking, so fucking down lately, like
I don't know what's happening, I'm just so tired all the time
I'm trying to sleep, I just, I just lay there quiet
Can't speak 'cause everyone around me is passed out
And my fucking mind is raging
Uh, hello? I don't even know why I called
I think it, I think it might be time for me to leave
Just call it quits, I'm sick of this
It's the same fucking day, every day
I think I sleep, I can't be sure though, it's all the same now
Drink, drink, drink again, I'm tired, man
I think it, you don't wanna hear this, I'm a mess
I'm sorry, man, I just don't know who to turn to
No one really hears me, you know?
I speak, at least I think I speak, but no one hears me
I've said enough
Hello? Hello? I shouldn't have called"
