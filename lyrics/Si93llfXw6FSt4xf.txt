We're gonna fight
We're gonna win
We're making skate a fucking threat again

We're on the prowl
For something cool
We're gonna shred your empty swimming pool

We're doing slappy's at the Circle K
And I did gnarly boneless while my walkman blasts out JFA

Don't be a pussy
There's no need to cry
So shut up and get rad
'Cause now it's time to skate or die
Yeah you don't need to know the reason why
Just shut up and get rad
'Cause now it's time to skate or die

Go!

Mullen's my god
He brings me joy
The second coming of skate and destroy

Brian was brave
He hit a cop
He won a trip down to the donut shop

We're waging war against the posers of the day
If we play our cards right someday
We might be in the Bones Brigade

Don't be a pussy
There's no need to cry
So shut up and get rad
'Cause now it's time to skate or die
Yeah you don't need to know the reason why
Just shut up and get rad
'Cause now it's time to skate or die

Shut up and get rad
It's time to skate or die
So shut up and get rad
'Cause now it's time to skate or die
Shut up and get rad
It's time to skate or die
So shut up and get rad
'Cause now it's time to skate or die
Shut up and get rad
It's time to skate or die
So shut up and get rad
'Cause now it's time to skate or die
Shut up and get rad
It's time to skate or die
So shut up and get rad
'Cause now it's time to skate or die
Skate!
