If I'm high on the hill, she'll still been looking down at me
What does she see that brings her closer every day to my heart?

If I'm away from home and think I'm all alone
She's there, somewhere
I look around to see and looking back at me
She's there, beware

She's creeping like a hungry cat
I've seen it before, I know it can mean that

The lady's starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck
The lady's starstruck, running after me
The lady's starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck
Yeeeah!

I could fly to the moon but she'd soon find a way to be there
I never knew for a while that a smile made them really care

She wants a souvenir, to everyone it's clear
She's hooked, one look
She wants a photograph but everybody laughs
But not me 'cause I see

She's creeping like a hungry cat
I've seen it before, I know it can mean that

The lady's starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck
The lady's starstruck, running after me
The lady's starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh my, the lady's starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck
The lady's starstruck, running after me
The lady's starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck
Oh, oh
Oh oh oh, uh oh

Oh my
The lady's starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck
The lady's starstruck, running after me, yeah
The lady's starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck
Yeeeah! Yeah

It used to be a game, now I can't repeat my name at all
She seems to believe that I never can refuse a call

She wants a souvenir, to everyone it's clear
She's hooked, one look
She wants a photograph and everybody laughs, ha
But not me 'cause I see

She's creeping like a hungry cat
I've seen it before, I know it can mean that

The lady's starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck
The lady's starstruck, running after me
The lady's starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck
Bad luck

The lady's starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck
The lady's starstruck, running after me
The lady's starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck
Bad luck, bad luck, bad luck

And back in a tree
I'm looking back at me
Blind and off my stare
I've just got to beware
The lady's starstruck, yes, she's bad luck
Bad luck
