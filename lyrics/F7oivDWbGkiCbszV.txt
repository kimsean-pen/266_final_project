Woke up this morning,
My dog was dead.
Someone disliked him
And shot him through the head.

Woke up this morning,
My cat had died.
I know I'll miss her,
Sat down and cried.

Came home this evening,
My hog was gone.
People here don't like me,
I think I'll soon move on.

Now somethings happened
That would make a saint frown.
I turned my back and
My house burned down.

Woke up this morning
My dog was dead
Someone disliked him
And shot him through the head

I woke up this morning
And my cat had died
Don't you know I'm gonna miss her
Sat down and cried
