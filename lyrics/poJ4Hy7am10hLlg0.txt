Last night I dreamt that I was you.
I was dressed in all black with dark glasses and attitude.
Such a pose I could simply not hold through days in the northern town that I had once called a home.

and they all said that you were the king of a gloomy disruption that surfaced when you would speak.

to a brownstone up three flights of stairs and it's on...

If I could have (had) my way this year would bridge '66 (again?)

Trust fund hipsters were casing the room chock full of amphetamines.
The overturned kick drum boom set the pace with incomparable cool.

And if the tempo was lousy it was lost on all but you...
