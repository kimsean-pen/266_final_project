Icaros, I dare you
For I possess the wings of faith
Though, heavy on my shoulders
(No measurement can prove their weight)
Still, a burden are they not to me
I am the challenger of gravity

The fear is not the fate I seek
My destiny will build upon
The mighty turbulence beyond
If I fall I will rise again

Some of envy
Some of fear
Admonish by the graves of those who fell
Praise the fool that pure of heart
Leaps off your finger
Into grace

Icaros, your voice once melted
Into the choir of the fallen ones
I have heard, I have seen
The purity of their song

Icaros
You fate embrace
A manifold of angels
I summon thee
From shattered graves
And call upon the wind
Receive my bow of reverence
Then spread your wings
