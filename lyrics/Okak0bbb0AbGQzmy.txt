Here on these cliffs of Dover
So high you can't see over
& while your head is spinning
Hold tight, it's just beginning

You come from parents wanton
A childhood rough & rotten
I come from wealth & beauty
Untouched by work or duty

& oh, my love, my love
& oh, my love, my love
We both go down together

I found you, a tattooed tramp
A dirty daughter from the labor camps
I laid you down on the grass of a clearing
You wept, but your soul was willing

& oh, my love, my love
& oh, my love, my love
We both go down together

& my parents will never consent to this love
But I hold your hand

Meet me on my vast veranda
My sweet, untouched Miranda
& while the seagulls are crying
We fall, but our souls are flying
& oh, my love, my love
& oh, my love, my love
& oh, my love, oh my love
& oh, my love, my love
We both go down together
