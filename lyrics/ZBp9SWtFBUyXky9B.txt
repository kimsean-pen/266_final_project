If you want to hang out, you've got to take her out, cocaine
If you want to get down, down on the ground, cocaine
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie, cocaine

If you got bad news, you want to kick them blues, cocaine
When your day is done and you want to run, cocaine
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie, cocaine

Your thing is gone and you want to ride on, cocaine
Don't forget this fact, you can't get it back, cocaine
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie, cocaine

She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie, cocaine
