First there was biology, then pornography
So says the Moral Majority
Telling you and me what we can watch and read
I don't need some dumb schmuck telling me

Nice communities, middle class families
Too much cleanliness, too much stupidity
I don't need nobody telling me
How to listen, how to speak

Whatever happened to the first amendment?
The way these people talk, they've never even heard it
