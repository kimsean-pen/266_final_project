So you think you know it all
But that's just the arrogance of youth
I've been there and I've done it, baby
I'm tellin' you the truth
Your Momma was a tear away
I used to think I knew it all
Thought I could play the game and not get played, no
But then the fall.

Don't you go pull a fast one
I used to be an awful rascal
Do you think you invented being bad?
I used to be a real rough-hewn
But had to become a tough one
Do you think you invented being bad?
(repeat)

I bet you think I look respectable
You should've seen me in my prime
You'd have thought that I was headed for, oh yeah
I life of crime.
I bet you think that you're the clever one, clever one
The one that got away.
Well, I've seen them come and seen them go, oh yeah
But I have it made.

I'm as sweet as I can be
I've earned respectability.
Do you know I have a history?
You won't get to pull the wool over my eyes
Fool, if you think you'll make a fool of me

Nothing you do remotely new.
It all been done, when I was young
In younger days I went astray
You mighta say, it's all a haze

It's all been done, your brand new craze
It all begun at Momma's place

Don't you go pull a fast one
I used to be an awful rascal
Do you think you invented being bad?
I used to be a real rough-hewn
But had to become a tough one
Do you think you invented being bad?
(repeat)
