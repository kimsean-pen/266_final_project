Remind me, I'm golden
The fortress above the sun
Why don't you spend nowhere with me?
Follow the river and the path of the ones
Write our names on the shore

Forever I can't find
Struggling in a world undefined
Or decide how you want it to be
I'm not eternity

Fly into the distant, disappear for awhile
I can't make sense of this
But we're here today feeling alive

It starts to fall apart
Let me take control, reminisce
The days and nothing more
Something I will find again, deliver us
Can't hear the words you say
But it doesn't really matter
I give the world to you
If you just...

Fly into the distant, disappear for a while
I can't make sense of this
But we're here today alive

Fly into the distant, disappear for a while
I can't make sense of this
But we're here today alive
