I miss you more...

In my thoughts you're far away
And you are whistling the melody,
Whistling the melody
Crystallizing clear as day
Oh I can picture you so easily,
Picture you so easily

What's gonna be left of the world if you're not in it?
What's gonna be left of the world, oh

Every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more

Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
I miss you more
I miss you more
I miss you more
I miss you more
I miss you more
I miss you more
I miss you
I miss you
I miss you
I miss you more

I miss you more

I miss you more

Caught off guard by your favourite song
Oh I'll be dancing at a funeral
Dancing at a funeral
Sleeping in the clothes you love
It's such a shame we had to see them burn
Shame we had to see them burn

What's gonna be left of the world if you're not in it?
What's gonna be left of the world, oh

Every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more

Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more

I miss you more
I miss you more
I miss you more
I miss you more
I miss you more
I miss you more
I miss you
I miss you
I miss you
I miss you more

I miss you more

I miss you more
