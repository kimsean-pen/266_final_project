When I was surrounded by the world, you were the only one who came.
And you were the only one astounded, which kept me grounded,
As the other girls thrashed my very name.

Then I looked over just in time to see her smiling back at me.
And saying everything's okay as long as you're inside my blue veins.
Your blue veins.

Yeah, and the feeling that you gave me...
No matter what I do or where I go, it will always remain.
And those who would enslave me to get to me,
Must get past you and will have no luck.
Cause you'll protect me from all pain.
(its true, you know what.)

The most beautiful...
Yeah, the most beautiful thing cause anything else can't compare.
Must be the blood that's running through your blue veins.
Your blue veins.
Your blue veins.

And I know you won't deceive me like the rest, and there's nothing you need to explain.
You always were the first one to believe me when I said to you, girl, 'I think it's gonna rain.'
But I could be wrong.

Yeah, but all of these things,
All these things, they're all truly nice but ain't nothing,
Ain't nothing compared to the love that's running through your little blue veins.
Your blue veins.
