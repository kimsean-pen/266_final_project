Suppression makes a weight
That strips the life of everything
To scared to walk away
Down in your heart
The image of a life

You're dying just to be there
Just crying on your knees

Be weary of the things you want
(The thorn in your paw, you crave)
You can't predict what's coming
Unlock your fingers from my hand
You never see the things you have
(There's always a way, to change)
Slice up and not across
When you're trying to make the deepest cut

Illusion makes a gape
That kills the flow of everything
To dumb to walk away
Down in your mind
You never even tried

You're dying just to be there
Just crying on your knees

You couldn't say her name in a single way
You never found the time
She didn't make a sound when she hit the ground
In the image of her life

Be weary of the things you want
(The thorne in your paw, you crave)
You can't predict what's coming
Unlock your fingers from my hand
You never see the things you have
(There's always a way, to change)
Slice up and not across
When you're trying to make the deepest cut

Be careful of what you desire
(The thorn in your paw, you crave)
You can predict what's coming
Unlock your fingers from my hand
You never give the things you want
(There's always a way, to change)
Slice up and not across
When you're trying to make the deepest cut
