We'd gather around
All in a room
Fasten our belts
Engage in dialogue

We'd all slow down
Rest without guilt
Not lie without fear
Disagree sans judgement

We would stay and respond
And expand and include
And allow and forgive
And enjoy and evolve
And discern and inquire
And accept and admit
And divulge and open
And reach out and speak up

This is utopia

This is my utopia
This is my ideal
My end in sight

Utopia
This is my utopia
This is my nirvana
My ultimate

We'd open our arms
We'd all jump in
We'd all coast down
Into safety nets

We would share and listen
And support and welcome
Be propelled by passion
Not invest in outcomes
We would breathe and be charmed
And amused by difference
Be gentle and make room
For every emotion

This is utopia
This is my utopia
This is my ideal
My end in sight

Utopia
This is my utopia
This is my nirvana
My ultimate

We'd provide forums
We'd all speak out
We'd all be heard
We'd all feel seen

We'd rise post-obstacle
More defined, more grateful
We would heal, be humbled
And be unstoppable
We'd hold close and let go
And know when to do which
We'd release and disarm
And stand up and feel safe

This is utopia
This is my utopia
This is my ideal
My end in sight

Utopia
This is my utopia
This is my nirvana
My ultimate
