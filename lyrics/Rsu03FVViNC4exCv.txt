My knife - it's sharp and chrome
Come see inside my bones
All of the fiends are on the block
I'm the new king, I'll take the queen
'Cause in here we're all anemic
In here - anemic and sweet so

Go get your knife, go get your knife
And come in
Go get your knife, go get your knife
And lay down
Go get your knife, go get your knife
Now kiss me

Oooh well I can float here forever
In this room we can't touch the floor
In here we're all anemic
In here - anemic and sweet so

Go get your knife, go get your knife
And come in
Go get your knife, go get your knife
And lay down
Go get your knife, go get your knife
Now kiss me

Ohh I could float here forever
Ohh Anemic and sweet
Ohh I could float here forever
Ohh Anemic and sweet so

Go get your knife, go get your knife
And come in
Go get your knife, go get your knife
And lay down
Go get your knife, go get your knife
Get filthy
Go get your knife, go get your knife
And kiss me
