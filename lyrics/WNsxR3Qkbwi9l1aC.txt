Not tonight, Josephine
In an army's strength
Therein lies the d√©nouement
From here you're haunting me
By the Seine
Oh, so beautiful
Only not to be of use
Impossible
Possible, oh yes

So strange, victory
Twelve hundred spires
The only sound Moscow burning
Empty like the Tuileries
Like a dream
Vienna seems
Only not to be of use
Impossible

I see balloons, oh yes

In the last extremity
To advance or not to advance
I hear you laughing
Even still you're calling me
Not tonight
Not tonight
Not tonight, Josephine
