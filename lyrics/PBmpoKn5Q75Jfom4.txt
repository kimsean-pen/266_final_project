I'm going to miss the way I missed you.
But I'm okay if you're okay.
I've been lonely when I'm with you.
But now I'm lonely all the same.
If you need to find yourself
in the arms of someone else
I wish you on your way
but my love
I've never been too good a change
I've never been too good a change
I'm gonna miss the way I kissed you.
But I'll be brave if you'll be brave
and this is only the beginning
Although it feels just like the end
If you need to take some time
I'd surrender, love of mine.
I wouldn't make you stay
But my love,
I've never been too good a change
