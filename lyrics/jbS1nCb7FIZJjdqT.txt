Come to me now
I will host you
I'm the alchemist of our times
I know exactly what you need

You've climbed so high
You've gone so far
So you deserve something special

Come to me now
I will cure your soul
I'm the savior of our times
I know exactly what it needs

You've let yourself go
You've felt so down
So my hi-tech salvation is just for you

(Obsession)
(Obsession)
Obsession

Obsession
Obsession
Obsession

To be the best, the most beautiful and above everyone
Not allow oneself to be left behind
Know what is what and what is out, aim for excellence
And perfection you can only dream about
Oh, go go go!

Before my fame evaporates I must be at the top
So I control my body mental state, unable to slow down
Before the final dusk appears I must do more than this
It's the only way to make it through in these hyperactive times

Before my fame evaporates I must be at the top
So I control my body mental state, unable to slow down
Before the final dusk appears I must do more than this
It's the only way to make it through in these hyperactive times

It's my obsession
Obsession
Obsession
Obsession!

Doggedly at any cost
Obstinately more and more
Can't allow myself to stop
The ice broke, I'll never give up
(Give up, give up) Again
(Give up, give up) Again
(Give up, give up) Again

Hi, it has been a while since last time
I was certain I could live without
All those private talks I couldn't stand
But now the truth is you're the best friend I have
