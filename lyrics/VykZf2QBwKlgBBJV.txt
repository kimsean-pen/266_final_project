I watch the sun go down and up again and think of you.
You're just too busy seeing red when all I see is blue.
I'm sorry, baby, for what I did to you.
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm sorry, baby.

I don't wanna hear a love song.
I don't wanna hear a love song.

I watch the sun go down and up again and think of you.
You're just too busy seeing red when all I see is blue.
I'm sorry, baby, for what I did to you.
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm sorry, baby.

I'm in the night and faint so long I'm thought as lost and gone.
So, just speed up, slow down,
it's time to go and this I know.
