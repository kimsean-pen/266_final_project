In came the girl withe the sad eyes and
Asked him over again
Was I too weak? was I a child? and
Can't we leave here and start again?

Said I don't mind if you take me down and
I don't ming if you brak it all, but
How much more can you take from me?
How much more can you take from me?

I'd like to take you inside my head
I'd like to take you inside of me
You came from heaven, is all he said,
You came from heaven and you came here to me,
And I love you...

He drove it fast to make the night
And looked at his angel, where she lay
Resting her head, and closed her eyes
Outside the heat and the summer fades
Deep in the sky, a storm he'd seen
Deep in the sky, a storm he'd seen
There ain't nothing, no girl so sweet
Took her from heaven and gave her to me
