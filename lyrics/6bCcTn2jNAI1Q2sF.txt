I'll never love somebody
I'll never love somebody
Leave me cold
Trouble song in the moonlight
Will be my bride

I'll never need somebody
I'll never need somebody
Leave me alone
A worried mind in the violence
Will be my guide

I'll never hold somebody
I'll never hold somebody
For very long
I make love, but only for a night
And I'll be gone

I'll never love somebody
I'll never love somebody
Leave me cold
The trouble song in the moonlight
Will be my bride
Will be my bride

Will be my bride, will be my bride
