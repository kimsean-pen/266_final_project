I eat boys like you for breakfast
Where's my salt 'n pepa now?
Oregano, basil and thyme and my Tapatio
I eat boys like you for breakfast

You've got a striking physique
Don't underestimate the hunter
Let's play hide and seek
You came to my island
You stepped on my lawn
You pissed off the dog too
You won't last 'til dawn
You insulted my mother
Caught you groping my sister
You crapped on my father
Say your last prayers mister

I eat boys like you for breakfast
Where's my knife and fork now?
Onions, tomeitos, tomatoes, poteitos potatoes

The rabbit was bragging of how fast he could run
Made a fool of the turtle chillin'in the sun
The race was on and the rabbit thought he won so he fell asleep
Now hear him weep
It's your chance to repent for all the days you spent playing king of the hill
It's an easy match but there is just one catch
By now you should know the drill
Yes you should know that

I eat boys like you for breakfast
Where's my knife and for now?
Onions, tomeitos, tomatoes, poteitos potatoes
I eat boys like you for breakfast

Sir, you've got a striking physique
Don't underestimate the hunter
Now let's play hide and seek
I eat boys like you for breakfast
