It got me going in a vertical loop
(And I love it, love it)
I'm underwater, I don't wanna compute
('Cause I'm above it, 'bove it)
I hyperventilate, it's making me hight
(I feel you like it, like it)
I got my ticket and I'm ready to ride
(Just let me try it, try it)

I got a feeling I can never explain
(Wanna give it, give it)
It's nothing serious, I just wanna play
(I wanna live it, live it)
I never thought you could do better with me
(I bet you did it, did it)
We elevate it to a higher degree, higher degree
(And I dig it)

We slip and slide
To excite the mind
Take a dip inside
Aquatic motor ride
We do really fly
Into the the mind side
An ecstatic sky
Aquatic motor ride

(Inside your love) Jacuzzi rollercoaster, Jacuzzi rollercoaster
(In a) Jacuzzi rollercoaster, Jacuzzi rollercoaster
At zero gravity, you're making me feel
(Kinda dizzy, dizzy)
I keep of thinking 'bout you keeping me near
(To come on visit, visit)
I keep on rising, riding into the night
(And I love it, love it)
And this a mystery, it's so out of sight
(Taken from above it, 'bove it)
It gets exhilarating as we dip and we dive
(Diving deep and [?])
I let my life keep stay in the light
(Giving on tripping, tripping)
So let me take you to the highest degree, highest degree
(Are you above it? 'Bove it)
Get on the station, bring your lover to me
('Cause you love it)
We slip and slide
To excite the mind
Take a dip inside
Aquatic motor ride
We do really fly
Into the the mind side
An ecstatic sky
Aquatic motor ride
(Inside your love)
