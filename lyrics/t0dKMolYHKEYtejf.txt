Would you tell me tough love style, put judicial weight on me?

If you're thinking anything, if you're thinking endlessly.
If you're thinking anything, if you're thinking...

I feel the breeze, feel feathers of an arrow.

I take my aim, so you feel me coming close.

Would you take a calm and tender terminal kind of care?
Would you touch me, cling and wage on intimate fight for me?

If you're thinking anything, if you're thinking endlessly.
If you're thinking anything, if you're thinking...
