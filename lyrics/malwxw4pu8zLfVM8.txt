I know we're doing
Everything that we want to
Meanwhile, are we losing?
Because we won't let go
And yet we go
Let's start thinking what we're doing
Don't let nothing change your mind
Let's start heading homeward bound
Get off the ground
Stop losing, yeah losing
Keep risin' to the top
You gotta wake up your body
and wake up your body
and wake up your body
and move it around
Wake up your body
wake up your body
wake up your body and move it around
Keep on believing
All the dreams inside of you
And don't stop achieving yeah
Let some love shine on through
And don't fight the feeling
Keep on dealing
Everybody, keep on moving
Cause I know we can get it over, so baby
Let's keep rising to the top
And we won't let nobody stop us
We'll just keep trying, yeah
Oooh baby
You gotta wake up your body
and wake up your body
and wake up your body
and move it around
Wake up your body
wake up your body
wake up your body and move it around
Big time illusions
Create a lot of confusion
But the time has finally come
Let's get it done
Keep moving, yeah moving
Let's keep rising to the top
And don't let nobody stop us
Just keep trying, yeah
Keep on giving to each other
Spread some love a little farther
Keep on giving all you got
Said we're rising to the top
We won't let nobody stop
What we're doing, yeah
Keep moving your body
The feeling's getting stronger
What we're doing
Just keep moving your body
The feeling's getting stronger
