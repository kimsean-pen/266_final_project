Turn on channel seven at a quarter to eight
You see the same damn thing it's just a different day
And no one really knows why this is happening, but it's happening
And everywhere you go it's just a different place
You've got the same dark feelings, see the same sad faces
No one really cares that this is happening

We come into this world
We are all the same
And in that moment there's no one to blame

But the world is black
And hearts are cold
And there's no hope
That's what we're told
And we can't go back
It won't be the same
Forever changed
By the things we've seen, seen

Living in this place it's always been this way
There's no one doing nothing so there nothing's changed
And I can't live when this world just keeps dying, it's dying
People always tell me this is part of the plan
That God's got everybody in his hands
But I can only pray that God is listening
Is he listening?

But living in this world
Growing colder every day
Nothing can stay perfect now I see

But the world is black
And hearts are cold
And there's no hope
That's what we're told
And we can't go back
It won't be the same
Forever changed
By the things we've seen, seen, seen

We come into this world
And we are all the same
And in that moment there's no one to blame
But we're living in this world
Growing colder every day
Nothing can stay perfect now I see

The world is black
And hearts are cold
And there's no hope
That's what we're told
And we can't go back
It won't be the same
Forever changed
By the things we've seen, seen, seen

Turn on channel seven at a quarter to eight
You see the same damn thing it's just a different day
And no one really knows why this is happening
