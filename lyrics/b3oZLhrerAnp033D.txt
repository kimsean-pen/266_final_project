Shit, I'm tired so turn me around
Can't sleep worth a shiny nickel if I had one
And I know, I know, I know
I don't know where I'm going
Guess I'm not much of a man, am I?
Looks like my uncle pinned me right
'Cause guess who's out the door
Sorry, stupid-looking sore

And as I drive by cemetery night
Close both of my eyes
Turn twice, then drive
Turn twice, then drive
Then I will know
Which way the doggies like to look in the morning
When their owners are sleeping in

Oh and the world, it is bleeding
In black and ivory
And the golden light upon the rising water through the trees
Is pleading with me
And now I know which way I'm going to go

As I wake up my own mind
Find likeness in my life
Say 'no' we won't be alike
I will be better this time

And I'll drive by cemetery night
Close both of my eyes
Turn twice, then drive
Turn twice, then drive
And now I know which way I'm going to go
