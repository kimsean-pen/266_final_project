There's a magical sound
Sliding over the ground
Making it shiver and shake
And a permanent cry
Falling out of the sky
Slippery and sly like a snake

With a delicate move
Kind of shifty and smooth
A shadow has covered the light
Then a beam in the shade
From a silvery blade
Has shattered the edge of the night

I know she waits below
Only to rise on command
When she comes for me
She's got my life in her hands

When a movement behind
Hit the side of my mind
I trembled and sit away
Then another assault
And I started to falter
Fibres of steel turned to clay

With a bubbly turn
Now the water should churn
And push it way from the core
And a lady in white
Will bring sun to the night
Brighter than ever before

I know she waits below
Only to rise on command
When she comes for me
She's got my life in her hands
Lady of the lake

There's a magical sound
Sliding over the ground
Making it shiver and shake
And a permanent cry
Falling out of the sky
Slippery and sly like a snake

With a delicate move
Kind of shifty and smooth
A shadow has covered the light
Then a beam in the shade
From a silvery blade
Has shattered the edge of the night

Straight down I'm swirling around
Blinded and bruised by the strain
There must be some way to see
Diamonds out of the rain

I know she waits below
Only to rise on command
When she comes for me
She's got my life in her hands
Lady of the lake
