I'll get away, get in the car
I'll reach the shore before sunrise
And I'll watch the moon and the stars
I'll tell them everything about us

I left last night and I reached the shore
Trying to find everything I lost
In a thousand waves
A million waves oh
Still, somewhere I'm sure
That I will see your face
I will see you there

Oh, morning sun, before you'll rise
Before you'll come and shine again on us
Let me find, let me find, let me find
Some comfort in the night
And I don't mind what I've lost
I've reached the shore
And nothing ever changed
In a thousand waves
A million waves
Oh still I look for love

And all I see is your face
all I see is your face
all I see is your face
I bleed but I'm choosing you again
I'm done but I'm ready to begin
all I see is your face
I bleed but I'm choosing you again
I'm done but I'm ready to begin

So I come back home to you

So I come back home to you
So I come back home to you
So I come back home to you
So I come back home to you
So I come back home to you
So I come back home to you
So I come back home to you
So I come back home to you
