I throw all of your stuff away
Then I clear you out of my head
I tear you out of my heart
And ignore all your messages

I tell everyone we are through
'Cause I'm so much better without you
But It's just another pretty lie
'Cause I break down
Every time you come around

Oh, oh

So how did you get here under my skin
Swore that I'd never let you back in
Should have known better than trying to let you go
'Cause here we go, go, go again

Hard as I try I know I can't quit
Something about you is so addictive
We're falling together
You'd think that by now I know
'Cause here we go, go, go again

You never know what you want
And you never say what you mean
But I start to go insane
Every time that you look at me

You only hear half of what I say
And you're always showing up too late
And I know that I should say goodbye
But it's no use
Can't be with or without you

Oh, oh

So how did you get here under my skin
Swore that I'd never let you back in
Should have known better than trying to let you go
'Cause here we go, go, go again

Hard as I try I know I can't quit
Something about you is so addictive
We're falling together
You think that by now I know
'Cause here we go, go, go again

Again
And again, and again
And again, and again
And again

I threw all of your stuff away
And I cleared you out of my head
And I tore you out of my heart

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

So how did you get here under my skin
Swore that I'd never let you back in
Should've known better than trying to let you go
'Cause here we go, go, go again

Hard as I try I know I can't quit
Something about you is so addictive
We're falling together
You think that by now I know
'Cause here we go, go

Here we go again
Here we go again

Should have known better
Than trying to let you go
'Cause here we go, go, go again

Again

And again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again
And again, and again
