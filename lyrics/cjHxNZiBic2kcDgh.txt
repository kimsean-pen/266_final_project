You know who you are
This is for you

Yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, ohh

I thought I knew who you were
I see now you were a lesson to learn
And all I am to you now
Is a bridge that's been burned

Now I was the first to believe
I made you part of my musical dream
And your thanks to me
Came without an apology, yeah

We wrote 'Loving Me 4 Me', 'Don't Walk Away'
'Can't Hold Us Down', all part of our history
'Don't forget Infatuation', 'I'm a Fighter'
'Feeling Under-appreciated'

Yeah, this song is for you to remind you
That I moved on, sang my songs, I've got no regrets

Hope it all was worth it
Looks like I didn't need you
Still got the album out, ha!
