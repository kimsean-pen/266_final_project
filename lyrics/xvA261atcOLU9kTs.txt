I hate everyone that I meet
But I'm getting better
Think before I speak because I
I know I've got a temper
(I know I've got a temper)
Screws are shaking loose
I'm bent and buckled
My teeth are clenched

Think I've blown a fuse
There's blood on my knuckles
The smile on my face is fake
And the vein on my head suggests you get running

I've had enough, had enough
Had enough, had enough yeah
Cause I've had enough
Think I'm reaching the limit
You should keep your distance
Cause I've had enough

Take a deep breath and count to three
And then I'll be behavin'
I feel like people just don't get me
Maybe I'm crazy

Think I've blown a fuse
There's blood on my knuckles
The smile on my face is fake
And the vein on my head suggests you get running

I've had enough, had enough
Had enough, had enough yeah
Cause I've had enough
Think I'm reaching the limit
You should keep your distance
Cause I've had enough

Well I guess it could be me
Quite possibly
I might be scared or insecure
I have been to hell before, the blame ain't yours
But the vein on my head suggests you get running
Cause I've had enough
Cause I've had enough

Think I'm reaching the limit
You should keep your distance
Cause I've had enough

Hey now, don't you know
I said hey now, don't you know, know
Cause I've had enough
Hey now, don't you know
I said hey now, don't you know, know
Cause I've had enough
