i am in the wilderness
you are in the music in the man's car next to me
somewhere in my sadness
i know i won't fall apart
completely

when i need to be rescued
and i need a place to swim
i have a rock to cling to
in the storm
when no-one can hear
me calling
i have you i can sing to

and in all this
and in all my life

you are the lovers rock
the rock that i cling to
you're the one
the one i swim to in a storm
like a lovers rock

i am in the wilderness
you are in the music in the man's car next to me
somewhere in my sadness
i know i won't fall apart
completely
and in all this
and in all my life

you are the lovers rock
the rock that i cling to
you're the one
the one i swim to in a storm
like a lovers rock

you are the lovers rock
the rock that i cling to
you're the one
the one i swim to in a storm
like a lovers rock

when i need to be rescued
you're there
when i need a place to swim to
in the storm
i think of you
and in all my life
and in all my life

you are the lovers rock
the rock that i cling to
you're the one
the one i swim to in a storm
like a lovers rock
