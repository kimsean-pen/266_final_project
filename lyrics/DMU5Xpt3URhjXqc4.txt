Reveal thy name!
What is your essence?
The creation of ashes and anger
Thy face is covered by whispers and shadows
Open Thy secrets and tell me,
What brought you here?
Death and darkness follow Thy steps.
You burn and left behind the places of hangmen
And disappear into the blackness
around the face of my beloved.
Heat and light are devouring us
inside the dead womb of emptiness
Is there hope it will let us out?
No!
And when you will aks why is it so cold,
My finger will point to it,
so don't be scared.
The end is nigh
His shadow is crawling behind your back.
How did we anger the lords?
Why does the curse follow us?
Is there an answer?
No...
There's only a silence...
