In my mind
And nailed into my heels
All the time
Killing what I feel

And everything I touch
(All wrapped up in cotton wool)
(All wrapped up and sugar coated)
Turns to stone

And everything I touch
(All wrapped up in cotton wool)
(All wrapped up and sugar coated)
Turns to stone

I am fused just in case I blow out
I am glued just in case I crack out

Everything I touch
Turns to stone
Everything I touch
(All wrapped up in cotton wool)
(All wrapped up and sugar coated)
Turns to stone
