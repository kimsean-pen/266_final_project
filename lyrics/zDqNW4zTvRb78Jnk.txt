I open my eyes
Reach for the phone
Not a word from ya baby
It don't leave my sight since we had that fight
Can't remember but maybe
I blew you up in the middle of the night again
You were drinking with your friends
You ignored it, but you got it

I get so neurotic about it baby
Cause I know you're reading your phone
I can't help I'm going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it
I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck and I almost wreck it
I always got it on me just in case you want me
So if you're looking for my love then light it up

Every time I unlock my screen
I hope I see one of them red lipstick I miss you pictures
I'm on your clock
You're in control
You want me now, baby go figure
My world's at the tips of your fingers

I get so neurotic about it baby
Cause I know you're reading your phone
I can't help I'm going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it
I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck and I almost wreck it
I always got it on me just in case you want me
So if you're looking for my love then light it up

Yeah baby light it up

I go to sleep, I check it
In the middle of the night I check it
I feel the buzz in my bed and I don't get no rest
I always got it on me just in case you want me
So if you're looking for my love then light it up

Yeah baby light it up
