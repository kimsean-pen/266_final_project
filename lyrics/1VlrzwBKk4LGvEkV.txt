A legion of demons
Born from boundaries of death
Like an onslaught of evil
To destroy this Earth

Covering the morbid skies
Like a mist of sulphur
I can see Satanas
Cursed of death

Terminate masses and reigns
With bloody axes of hate
The beasts of son of devil
Tormenting the preachers of Christ

The humans try to react
To this nuclear war
Which is like a endless pain
Burning in the fire of Hell

Covering the morbid skies
Like a mist of sulphur
I can see Satanas
Cursed of death

A legion of demons
Born from boundaries of death
Like an onslaught of evil
To destroy this Earth
