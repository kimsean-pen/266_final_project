(One night in heaven, one night in heaven)
(One night in heaven, one night in heaven)

Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah

Sometimes I get to thinking while you are far away
Just how much I miss you and how time it ticks away
So sad when we are fighting, too much tension too much hate
Sometimes I need reminding before it gets too late

Just one moment in my day, yeah
Take me up to a place
So far away in your heavenly space

One night (One night), mm, one night in heaven
When you touch me
You take me up high with the clouds in the sky
One night (One night), whoa, one night in heaven
When you kiss me
You light up my life, make me feel so alive

While people create problems, lie and cheat in vain
Come lay with me in my bed and wash away the pain
Take me on a journey and let the pleasure start
Take me on a journey that leads straight to your heart

Just one look I can see it in your face, yeah
You're my love satellite
In orbit with you such a beautiful place

One night (One night), mm, one night in heaven
When you touch me
You take me up high with the clouds in the sky
One night (One night), whoa, one night in heaven
When you kiss me
You light up my life, make me feel so alive

Just give me one night
Just give me one night
Just give me one night
Just give me one night
Oh I'm in heaven baby
(Oh I'm in heaven baby)
Oh I'm in heaven baby
(Oh I'm in heaven baby)

One night (One night), mmm one night in heaven
When you touch me
You take me up high with the clouds in the sky
One night (One night), whooh, one night in heaven
When you kiss me
You light up my life, make me feel so alive

One night,
Just one night
One night,
One night, one night one night
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
One night
One night, one night, one night
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
One night, whoa, one night in heaven
When you kiss me
You light up my life, make me feel so alive
