It might be too late to say
But I love you so much
Some things just got in the way
I know we kinda lost touch
It's just so hard to make time
And maybe we don't ever get a chance
But now things seem to unwind
While the universe is crumbled at our feet
And I'll cut this out of me
If you'll cut this out of you
And we'll both forget to bleed
Because we've got no more to lose
I know we've been in a cage
But I'm sure we could be free
And we're both so full of pain
But I'll cut mine out of me
