taking potions to sleep through the daytime
waking up to the heat of the night
no horizons no exchanges
we'll get it on with those summertime lights

pretty lovers pretty lovers
this night is warm so give me your charms
pretty lovers pretty lovers
this night is ours cause the daylight won't come
the daylight won't come

breakfast parties and low body visions
touching souls on the burning walls
this coffee's contagious as after school kisses
we're singing songs on the boulevard of charms
when the wind is calm, I'm all me yeah I'm all on

pretty lovers pretty lovers
this night is warm so give me your charms
pretty lovers pretty lovers
this night is ours cause the daylight won't come

who's the last standing who's the last lover to call (pretty lovers pretty lovers)
who's a gonna make it, take it, to the solar withdrawal
cause pretty lovers are falling for ya

this night is warm (sunshine can wait)
on a wish it will ripen (sunshine can wait)
my body can breathe in this dark heat it needs
cause the daylight won't, daylight won't, daylight won't come

this night is for my solar withdrawal
this night is for my solar withdrawal
don't need no other lover, don't need the day to come
just need the heat and we'll get it on
