Cruel to the eye
I see the way he makes you smile
Cruel to the eye
Watchin' him hold what used to be mine

Why did I lie?
Why did I walk away to find?
Ooh why? Ohh why?

I can't breathe easy
Can't sleep at night till you're by my side
No, I can't breathe easy
I can't dream yet another dream
Without you lying next to me, there's no air

Curse me inside
For every word that caused you to cry
Curse me inside
I won't forget, no I won't baby I

Don't know why, don't know why
I left the one I was looking to find
Ooh why? Ohh why? Why?

I can't breathe easy
Can't sleep at night till you're by my side
No, I can't breathe easy, breathe easy
I can't dream yet another dream
Without you lying next to me there's no air

Out of my mind
Nothing makes sense anymore
I want you back in my life
That's all I'm breathing for
Can't sleep at night till you're by my side
Yeah, now I can't breathe easy
I can't dream yet another dream
Without you lying next to me, there's no air
There's no air
