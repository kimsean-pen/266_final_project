I tried to make a break, what a fool
I should've known I never listen
I'm in a cage, an animal, I'm in a cage
But the reptiles, they won't let me go
I think they want you to stray

Watch the monkey dance, give 'em a taste
Look at him he's always smiling
Help me to escape! Your mouth agape
You foreign tourist
Woe is me, it will be a funeral, a circus
I'll rap on the cell door

Questions are a fire that needs feeding to survive
So just you let those flames die down

Trained by consequence and the lash
It leaves me breathless
Their praise is a poison to us all
In the moonlight
Their scars flash like jewelry
Get too precious
Get locked up in a cage

Want to get, gotta risk
Any move misconstrued and you're screwed
Tongues flash and flick as if they're screamin
Oh they lie just like any lover
Oh do they, those kisses will burn

Under the lights, they snap a finger
You jump, you answer
Like a naive hooker with a big dumb smile
For the reptiles
I guess you'll never know
They won't let you go
Cause you're the soup du' jour
That's for sure

Questions are a fire that needs feeding to survive
So just you let those flames die down
See them reptiles crawl? Getting closer
Why won't someone come to drive them away?

Don't rest too long
It's a mistake you can't take back
Take one lying down for a change
And oh, it's like cleaning up
After an orgy when it's over
I wish someone would burn this place to the ground.
