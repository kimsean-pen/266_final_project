Wherever you go
Wherever you may wander in your life
Surely you know
I always wanna be there

Holdin' you hand
And standing by to catch you when you fall
Seein' you through
In everythin' you do

Let me be there in your mornin'
Let me be there in you night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right

Let me take you through that wonderland
That only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there

Watchin' you grow
And goin' through the changes in your life
That's how I know
I always wanna be there

Whenever you feel
you need a friend to lean on, here I am
Whenever you call
you know I'll be there

Let me be there in your mornin'
Let me be there in you night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right

Let me take you through that wonderland
That only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there

Let me be there in your mornin'
Let me be there in you night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right

Let me take you through that wonderland
That only two can share
All I ask you is let me be there
All I ask you is let me be there
