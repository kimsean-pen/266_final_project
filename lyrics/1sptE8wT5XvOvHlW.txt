Awakening. World Suffering
Twisted things emphathize with nothing.
Trampling. Screaming. Uncaring
He doesn't know in which place he's in.
Rusty razors cut his skin
Over and over and over again.
Dead resolve and relentless pain.
Acid's flowing within his veins.
Memories suppressed deep within
Resurfacing. It's growing from sin
The sin of I-never-put-up-a-fight.
He's looking back now: He's wasted his life.
He's creator. Warden. Prisoner
Builder of walls around pitiful halls.
He built a lock so I threw away the key
This is how little you mean to me.
The spirit is void from the soul's lonely throne.
There's no meat anymore. Only bone.
Once-was-razors cutting your skin
Screaming. Screaming. Screaming
Over and over and over again
And again and again
And again.
