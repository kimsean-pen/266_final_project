The enemy is after me again
Afraid of the sea and what's down there
I need to sleep
It's been a whole week
'Cause tears keep falling into my pool
Bright lights driving right into me cold
I need to sleep
It's been a whole week
'Cause tears keep falling into my pool
Bright lights driving right into me cold
My bones keep breaking
Tearing me away from the quiet
The silence of my soul, of my soul from the quiet
Night time, grueling, just time to waste
Heights they kill me, leave scarring on my face
'Cause I never, ever, ever fall into sleep
And I've never, ever, ever felt so weak
'Cause tears keep falling into my pool
Bright lights driving right into me cold
My bones keep breaking
Tearing me away from the quiet
The silence of my soul, of my soul from the quiet
I wanna fall down
I wanna fall down
I wanna fall down
