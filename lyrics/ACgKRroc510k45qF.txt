Okay, I'm the one who took you for granted
I've made my mistakes
Wake up let's not break up

(Thrill me)
You've got a love so strong
(Thrill me)
You really turn me on
(Thrill me)
Wait till tomorrow night
(Thrill me)
I'm gonna treat you right

You said that I would never let you be alone
How many times have you been on your own
Worked for the days and all the things you try to do
If only my heart would never let you through because you

(Thrill me)
You've got a love so strong
(Thrill me)
You just can't do me wrong
(Thrill me)
Wait till tomorrow night
(Thrill me)
I wanna treat you right

Feel
Ok, feel so good
Your hands were like silk on my back
Come on, come on

Oh yeah
Feel it baby

The truth is you've gone and left me on my own
How can I face the fact that you're really gone
Love was a phase we'd have to pray to make it true
If only my heart would've never let you through because you

(Thrill me)
You've got a love so strong
(Thrill me)
You really turn me on
(Thrill me)
Wait till tomorrow night
(Thrill me)
I wanna treat you right

Oh yeah
Feel so good
Feel, feel me, feel me
Feel me, feel me, feel
