You took my penny and you dropped it down the well.
You thought it was your luck but you it let you down again.
And I blame you.
I blame you.

You took my hand and you lead me off a cliff.
I thought that i could trust, but you let me down again.
And I blame you.
I blame you.

Love please stay just for a minute
I know there's something that you didn't notice
I know you can't stay just for a minute
Cuz you're not that type.

I blame you.

Love please stay just for a minute
I know there's something that you didn't notice
I know you can't stay just for a minute
Cuz you're not that type.

You said time and time again that I'd make you run away
But I want you, I need you.

Love please stay just for a minute
I know there's something that you didn't notice
I know you can't stay just for a minute
Cuz you're not that type. (2X)
