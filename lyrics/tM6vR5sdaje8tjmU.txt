Try and see it
Restless
I'm not there
Or not there yet

But if I'm coming
I must be whole enough
I found out my body
Innocent rest when I'm near you becomes amorance
I'm so tired
Of such activity
I must justify
My presence by being --

I must keep a steady gaze
Keep a steady gait
And I may become someone else

Here it comes
Here it comes
Here it comes

Here it comes
Here it comes
Here it comes

In the moment
Of confusion
I don't know what to say
And I hear myself ask

It doesn't have to be me
Could've swap it in please
The part b is a subconscious

My desire takes place
Anywhere everywhere
Everywhere

Here it comes
Here it comes
Here it comes
Here it comes

Here it comes
Here it comes
Here it comes
