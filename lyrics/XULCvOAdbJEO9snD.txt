She likes the boys who can dance
Yeah, she likes musicians
Signed pictures of them all, hanging there by her bedroom shelf
She just wants to be like the girls on the television
'Cause no one ever told her, it was okay to love herself

Oh-oh-oh-ohh
Be still, beating heart
'Cause this is her show
And you'll never be the star

'Cause she falls in love every night
Don't even know your name, but know it's right
You know it in the crowd just by her eyes
It's not her fault that she wants who she wants, yeah
She falls in love every night
And she don't even know what love is like
She been dancing in the dark for all her life
It's not her fault that she wants what she wants, yeah

She sings her favourite songs, does her make up in the bathroom
She dances in the mirror, lays her dresses out on the bed
She'll leave her lipstick on you like a tattoo
So when you try to wash it off
You'll remember that you can't forget

Oh-oh-oh-ohh
Beat still, beating heart, ohh
'Cause this is her show
And you'll never be the star

'Cause she falls in love every night
Don't even know your name, but know it's right
You know it in the crowd just by her eyes
It's not her fault that she wants what she wants, yeah
She falls in love every night
And she don't even know what love is like
She been dancing in the dark for all her life
It's not her fault that she wants what she wants, yeah

Ohhh
Ohhh
Ohhh
It's not her fault that she wants what she wants, yeah

It's not her fault that she wants what she wants
