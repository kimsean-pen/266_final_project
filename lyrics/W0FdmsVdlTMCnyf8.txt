She called me up late last night
A quarter past three
She's waiting on the bright moonlight
She's waiting for me

I don't understand
She already knows I'm on my way
She starts calling
How controlling
What's on to her and say

You know what you're doing to me
You know what you're doing to me
You know what you're doing to me
You know what you're doing to me

No work, no worries here
Everything's for free
When the world turns upside down
You should blame it on me

I don't understand this
She already knows it's wrong
She starts calling, I start falling
And then I dream my hero says

You know what you're doing to me
You know what you're doing to me
You know what you're doing to me
You know what you're doing to me

Try to hold and say
She can lead my hands
My body is shaking
My bones are breaking
I should talk to her and say

You know what you're doing to me
You know what you're doing to me
You know what you're doing to me
You know what you're doing to me
