How would you feel if I was to kneel right down,
at your feet, right now?
Is the way it's going to be from
now until to forever,
Let's have less of getting clever with me

Who would you blame for blowing the flame right out?
Is it me?
There is no doubt I can do what I want to do from
now until forever,
Let's have less of getting clever with me

You're wasting your time
and my time as well la la la living a lie,
I guess that time will tell.
You're making excuses
'bout the things you never done.
Walking in circles, blinded by the sun.
Blinded the sun.

I don't mean to sound unkind,
to you.
You just have to go and find
something else to do.
And don't ask me what went wrong
the list goes on and on and on and on.
The list goes on and on and on and on.
The list goes on and on.
