Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I was treading on the beach, summer underneath my feet
Somewhere I'd never seen
Momma lead me by the hand
'Til the grit stuck with the dam
And the foam fizzed adrift
When we both stroll in

I can feel the detritus lifting
And it moves like I knew that I was free again
And without thinking I ventured out swimming, across the sea
The current battles way down below me
Drifting, but holding on
I keep my head up to watch the shore

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

After many years apart, hoping I would find the path
I arrived at the start
In the shadow of a cliff, memories floating in the wind
I spread out to the tide
On my own this time

I can feel the detritus lifting
But a teardrop tickled as it ran away
But it got worse, then I washed it off swimming, across the sea
I get the feeling
I always have been swimming, across the sea
The current battles way down below me
Drifting, but holding on
I keep my head up to watch the shore
Swimming
Swimming
