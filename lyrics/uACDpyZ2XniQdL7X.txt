He's been wearing a happy face
It's for his own sake
Yeah they're still not awake
They're still not up today

Yeah he's down in his bad luck
He's been stuck in a rut
He imagines who will take his place
Reenacting his bad luck again

Gradually they're not gonna wait
For it ain't quite the perfect fate
But he's gotta react before they can say
Before he's beneath a shallow grave

Yeah he's down in his bad luck
He's been stuck in a rut
He was bound, face down a pit
Reenacting his bad luck over and over again
(Oh! Again and again!)
