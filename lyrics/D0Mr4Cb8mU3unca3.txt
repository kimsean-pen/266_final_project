Morrigan you come again
Morgan La Fay, raven on my sill of frost
Far away from the sea of the setting sun
Isle of fire and albatross
Taught so well, Magic Merlin the wizard
Maiden of beauty dressed in rainbow
Come to me
Come to me
Come to me

Damon girl the daughter of Saul
Queen of the Underworld... She'll have us all
Damian who's seductress of lust
The peasants and Kings
Your heart she will turn into dust
Damian she's the mortal of man
Lives in my dreams in darkness
Reaches out her hand
Come to me
Come to me

Fata Morgana. . . She will take you
You're a hungry scarred harlot
Hunting another heart
Morrigan fallen angel
Kneeled upon the widows altar
Temptress of my dreams...
She's the widow of my dreams

Far beyond the realm of dream, your wildest dream
Ascend to the plane, an imaginary game we play
Past the golden pillars of the lore to Lemuria

Morrigan upon her throne
She's a mirrored mirage of my desire
Passion slave, her life I gave, jump into her fire

Fata Morgana... She will take you
You're a hungry scarred harlot
Hunting another heart
Morrigan, fallen angel
Kneeled upon the widows altar
Temptress of my dreams. . .
She's the widow in my dreams
Luring me to ecstacy
Damian my fantasy
