I go humble
You're so curiously pure
Only before you I am humble

I go humble
You amaze me
Only before you I am humble

I should be arrested
For my emotional stunts
Only before you I am humble

I'm queen of provocation
I wake people up
Only before you I am humble

I go humble
I adore you
Only before you I am humble

I should be arrested
For my emotional stunts
Only before you I am humble
