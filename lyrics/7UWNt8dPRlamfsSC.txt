I recall when we were younger
On a day not unlike today
When things began between us
Straight from the heart or God, or even love itself

And I saw the mailman
But he failed to deliver

And just like that the air began to feel different
And the light hit things just right
And I became so easy
And just like that we fell

I see it all the days
In the surface of the reception
As long as the sun does shine
Baby, please come back
Baby, please come back
