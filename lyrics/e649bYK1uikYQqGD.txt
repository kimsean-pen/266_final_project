Some day you'll see
Surrounded by angels
Floating atop of the sea

On banded knees
Don't go where they go
Don't sing all the songs they sing

Nobody knows you the way you know you
But I think I do
But I thought I knew
Yeah, I thought I knew
Nobody knows you the way you know you
But I think I do
When I thought I knew
Yeah, I thought I knew

Between these walls
Her bark-stripped limbs, casts shadows frighteningly tall
I slow to a crawl
I jump and I yell but she hears nothing at all

Nobody knows you the way you know you
But I think I do
When I thought I knew
Yeah, I thought I knew
Nobody knows you the way you know you
But I think I do
When I thought I knew
Yeah, I thought I knew

Stay, stay the same
'Cause everything else will change
And I've always been to blame
So please just stay the same

The currents pull me in
The tide has reached my chin
My seaweed tickles skin
Just let the water win
I'm freezing to the bone
You'll never be at home
Just watch, you're running out
Just watch your body go

Nobody knows you the way you know you
But I think I do
When I thought I knew
Yeah, I thought I knew
Nobody knows you the way you know you
But I think I do
When I thought I knew
Yeah, I thought I knew
