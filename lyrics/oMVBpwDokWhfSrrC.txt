Well it's been almost a year to the moment
When I finally realized it was over
And I knew that loves wasn't
Good enough of a reason for me to stay

Well I saw you yesterday
You were driving
And I tried so hard to forget you were alive
And as you passed by I began to cry

Over things that I did not say
And hiding beneath

My blankets and sheets I'm finally free
I'm killing the ghost of you
And the ghost to awakening in me
Yeah yeah
So I'm taking my heart and getting' me out

And love's something that I wouldn't want to live with out
So I'm taking my heart and I'm getting me out of
My own my own my own
Well it takes all of my strength to be stable

And I force your insults under the table
And if you were wise you would compromise
And allow my to live my way
'Cause I am not a force to be reckoned with

And you don't have a clue what you're messing with
And you can't see through to the best of me
'Cause it's more than your heart can take
And hiding beneath
My blankets and sheets I'm finally free

I'm killing the ghost of you
And the ghost to awakening in me
I'm awakening me
I'm awakening me

I'm awakening me
Yeah yeah
So I'm taking my heart and getting' me out

And love's something that I wouldn't want to live with out
So I'm taking my heart and I'm getting me out of
My own my own my own
I'm taking my heart and setting me free
And baby now you're just another song to me
And the edge of your sword isn't sharp enough
For me to bleed
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
