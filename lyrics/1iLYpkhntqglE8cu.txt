Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

Nobody ever loved me like he does
Oh yes, he does, oh yes, he does
And if somebody loved me like he do me
Oh yes, he do me, oh yes, he do

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

I'm in love for the first time
Don't you know it's gonna last?
If this love would last forever
If this love would lasts so [Incomprehensible]

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

And from the first time that he really done me
Oh yes, he done me, he done me good
I guess nobody ever really done me
'Til he done me, he done me good

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
