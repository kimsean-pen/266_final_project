I found out what I've been missin'
Always on the run
I've been lookin' for someone

Now you're here like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see

That you give good love to me, Baby
So good, take this of heart mine into your hands
You give good love to me
(You give good love to me)
Never too much
(Never too much, will never be)
Baby you give good love

Never stoppin' I was always searchin'
For that perfect love
The kind that girls like me dream of

Now you're here like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see

You give good love to me, Baby
So good, take this of heart mine into your hands
You give good love to me
(You give good love to me)
Its never too much
(Never too much, will never be)
Baby, you give good love
Uuh

Now I, I can't stop looking around
It's not, what this loves all about
Our love is here to stay, to stay

Baby, you give good love
(You give good love to me)
You give
(Never too much, will never be)
So good, take this of heart mine into your hands

You give good love to me
(You give good love to me)
Never, never too much
(Never too much, will never be)
