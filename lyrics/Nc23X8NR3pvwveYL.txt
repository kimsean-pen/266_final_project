I better save my appetite
For all the cake I'mma eat tonight
Close your eyes and make a wish

Looking pretty by candlelight
Naughty minds they think alike
I got just the perfect gift

Celebration time is coming
New sensation ain't that something
It's that one thing we all came for
Everyone they, they wanna be you

Let's party like it's your birthday
Party like it's your birthday
Come on and put your lips together
Blow the candle out

Party like it's your birthday
Party like it's your birthday
I wanna make you feel real special
Put your name in lights

We are gonna party like it's your birthday
Gonna party like it's your birthday
Gonna party like it's your birthday
Blow the candle out

We are gonna party like it's your birthday
Gonna party like it's your birthday
Gonna party like it's your birthday
Blow the candle out

All your dreams will come alive
You want the one to put in the time
Surely I've done something right?

Separated from the rest
I'd say you're better than the best
Night is yours and you are mine

Celebration time is coming
New sensation ain't that something
It's that one thing we all came for
Everyone they, they wanna be you

Let's party like it's your birthday
Party like it's your birthday
Come on and put your lips together
Blow the candle out

Party like it's your birthday
Party like it's your birthday
I wanna make you feel real special
Put your name in lights

We are gonna party like it's your birthday
Gonna party like it's your birthday
Gonna party like it's your birthday
Blow the candle out
