February 12th, 1973
The prayers of thousands were answered
The war was over and the first of the prisoners returned
Needless to say it was the happiest day in up to thirteen years for most
Others, the real nightmare had just begun
The nightmare of readjustment
and for those, we will pray

ah aaaooooahaha ooooo
Woah oh oah
Woah oh oah
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh woah

Woah oh oah
Woah oh oah
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh woah

Woah oh oah
Woah oh oah
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh woah

Woah oh oah
Woah oh oah
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh woah

Woah oh oah
Woah oh oah
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh woah

Father, bless the soldier who has returned home from the war
He has fought with all his might
yet he knew not for what or who he was fighting for
Death waited in the shadows
as he crawled by night for his country
his enemies was many
including the habit he still cannot break
Father, we pray that we might understand what has happened to his mind
and help us understand his reaction to the changes that has taken place here at home
And Father, smile upon us with your grace, for we will need you more than ever
help him understand that when his loved ones remarried
they were truly under the impression that he was dead
and would never return
Oh Lord, we pray

And Father, why must wars be fought?
Someone said this war ended with "Peace with Honor"
but can that truly be?
Is there such a thing?
Thousands of boys gave their life, and for what?
Do anybody know?

Oh Lord, give us the strength to undertand ourselves
For we are a mysterious animal
Man
And as the boys march home to the witch's castle
They will all need your help
I can hear them calling, calling out to you Father
for there is no one else that can help
Smile upon us, oh Lord
For we are very weak
Very weak
Very Weak
Very weak
Very weak
