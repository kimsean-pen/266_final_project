I am guilty
Ashamed of what I've done, what I've become
These hands are dirty
I dare not lift them up to the Holy one

You plead my cause
You right my wrongs
You break my chains
You overcome
You gave your life
To give me mine
You say that I am free
How can it be, Yeah
How can it be

I've been hiding
Afraid I've let you down, inside I doubt
That You could love me
But in Your eyes there's only grace now

You plead my cause
You right my wrongs
You break my chains
You overcome
You gave your life
To give me mine
You say that I am free
How can it be, Yeah
How can it be, Yeah

Though I fall, you can make me new
From this death I will rise with you
Oh, the grace reaching out for me, Yeah
How can it be
How can it be

You plead my cause
You right my wrongs
You break my chains
You overcome
You gave your life
To give me mine
You say that I am free, Yeah

You plead my cause
You right my wrongs
You break my chains
You overcome
You gave your life
To give me mine
You say that I am free

How can it be, Yeah
How can it be, Yeah
