Those eyes they transmit
All your loving
Echoes light into dark hearts
I would swear I've seen this, left beside me
Your eyes they hypnotize

She keeps me here so spellbound
Her love pulls me near to stranger ground
I've lost my mind there
This dark magic mirror, spellbound

A heart-shaped face
With words as cold as stone
I can't believe this is my fate

She raised your head
Now the night, it's coming down
I accept this fate i accept my love you won't be long
You keep me here so spellbound
Your love pulls me near to sacred ground
I lost my mind there
This dark magic mirror, spellbound
And i can't leave now
Leave her now (x2)

She keeps me near so spellbound
Her love pulls me near to stranger ground
I lost my mind there
This dark magic mirror, spellbound (x2)
So spellbound (x3)
