Love, it ain't all too much
Say there wouldn't be another to love
Something in the way you talk to me
Something in the way you talk to me
(Uh huh)
(Music)
Do you have to come tonight?
Realize there I have no love
Something you really taught to me
Something so crazy temporally

As if you know
Know, know
As if you know
Know, know
(Music)
Know if you let my life
Hidden on love (?)
Something in the way you talk to me
(??) Seen
As if you know
Know, know
As if you know
Know, know
As if you know
Know, know
As if you know
Know, know
As if you know
Know, know
As if you know
Know, know
As if you don't
(Music)

As if you know
Know, know
As if you know
Know, know

As if you know
Know, know
As if you know
Know, know
