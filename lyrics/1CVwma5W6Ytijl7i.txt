Hey, caveman!
When did you see the sky last time?
How deep is
That treasure you are told to find?

The reflect of what you feel, what you breathe
Is that what you really are?
Caveman!
Hey, caveman, what's your life so far?

Quench your thirst with a spit
Satisfy your hunger with shit
Make a bed full of trash
Do you think you're doing well?

Wash your face in some sweat
Out of shame and disrespect
Day by day wake up in sorrow
And go to work in hell!

Poverty and hunger are everything
That's waiting for you outside
Stay in here! They will take care of you
Relax, you are unlikely to endure

Caveman!
When did you see the sky last time?
How deep is
That treasure you are told to find?

The reflect of what you feel, what you breathe
Is that what you really are?
Caveman!
Hey, caveman, what's your life so far?

Once the dust ate your eyes away
And donated sweetest apathy
But still you sense your brothers' hollow heartbeat

And gruff voices of your family
I can see furrows on this face fouled with fly-ash
There's nothing remained but a tiny piece of coal in your chest

Bygone world was depredated long ago
Now, they are here to plunder your home
But don't mourn!
Shit!

Abandon all hopes about freedom.
No hoard of value can replace it
Abandon all hopes about freedom
No hoard of value can replace it.

Punch a blunt fang of this rusty cavil into stones!
Come on and fracture another course to the better world!
Get down to work!

Dig!
Harder!
Faster!
Deeper!

Harder!
Dig!
Harder!
Faster!

Deeper!
Harder!
Dig!
Harder!

Faster!
Deeper and harder!
Dig!
Harder!

Faster!
Deeper!
Harder!
Dig!
