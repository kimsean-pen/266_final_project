Well it's cold, the lake is frozen
She floats across at night
No brace then to be broken
I know who haunts that night

So if you're gonna let me down
Let me down easy
And if you're gonna let me down
Let me know
Let me know right now
And if you're gonna let me down
Let me down easy
And if you're gonna let me down
Let me know
Let me know right now

Before the words are spoken
I know what's on your mind
So now it's in the open
Don't wanna know
Don't wanna know
Why

Cause if you're gonna let me down
Let me down easy
And if you're gonna let me down
Let me know
Let me know right now
And if you're gonna let me down
Let me down easy
And if you're gonna let me down
Let me know

Cause I have to know
Cause I have to know
Cause I have to know
Cause I have to know
Cause I have to know

If you're gonna let me down
Let me down easy
And if you're gonna let me down
Let me know
Let me know right now
And if you're gonna let me down
Let me down easy
And if you're gonna let me down
Let me know

Let me know right now
