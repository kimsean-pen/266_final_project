Rain is falling on a European street
Park your car outside and be discreet
My light will be on
There's a view from my window
But it's nothing, hurry on

Rain is falling in and out of time
In slow designs through neon signs
I wish you were here
Dark and unclear
As the night time traffic looks to me

Can you hear secret music?
Secret lives on secret nights
Can you hear secret music?
Secret lives on secret nights
Can you hear secret music?
Secret lives on secret nights

Can you sing a song quietly? (And the words will remind me)
Can you sing a song quietly? (And the words will remind me)
Can you sing a song quietly? (And the words will remind me)
Can you sing a song quietly? (And the words will remind me)
Can you sing a song quietly? (And the words will remind me)
Can you sing a song quietly?
Can you sing a song quietly?
Can you sing a song quietly?
