Ah dreamy lips, set in motion, flashing
Ah breathless hush, poundin' soft, lasting
Oh glossy mouth, a taste untamed, moving
Carousel, up and down
Just like you

Oh baby
Just one more time to touch you
Just one more time to tell you
You're on my mind
Baby, why can't I have you?
You're breakin' my heart in two
You know what I'm goin' through

Oh baby, why can't I have you?

Oh candy smile, all the while, glinting
Your eyes like mica, a lethal pout, hinting
(Felt the pressure)
Ooh and I felt the pressure, tight and warm, softly striking
(Ooh tripped and stumbled)
Ooh I tripped and stumbled

I cling forever
I go all night

Oh baby
Just one more time to touch you
Just one more time to tell you
I'm not so blind
Baby, why can't I have you?

Always breakin' my heart in two
You know what I'm goin' through
Uh oh baby, why can't I have you?

(Baby) oh baby (why can't I have you?) why can't I have you?
You know what I'm goin' through
(You're breakin' my heart in two)
You're breakin' my heart, breakin' my heart
(You know what I'm gonna do)
(You're breakin' my heart) breakin' my heart
(Baby) oh baby (why can't I have you?) I need you
(You know what I'm goin' through)
You're breakin' my heart (you're breakin' my heart in two)
Oh baby, I need you so much, I need you, touch
(You know what I'm gonna do)
(You're breakin' my heart)
(Baby) oh baby (why can't I have you?)
(You know what I'm goin' through)
