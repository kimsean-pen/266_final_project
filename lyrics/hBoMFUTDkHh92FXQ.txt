Wake up, go to work
Come home, it's not working
We've been living our whole lives
On a system that is broken

Your words, I hear them
They' re sharp, can't get near them
We've got one lost chance
One more time to make this happen

We've got one time, time to get this right
2 times and you know it's not my style
3's company, just you and me
We need to figure this one out
4 letter words are all you said
5 minutes later we're in bed
Can't count you to love me
But
I can't count the days since you've been gone

Wake up, I come home
I realize that it's not working
You're gone, it echoes
I missed the noise of all our fighting

And you know that I don't mean the words I say
And I know that you don't wanna to stay away
How long I'm gonna be
Counting the days you're gone

We've got one time, time to get this right
2 times and you know it's not my style
3's company, just you and me
We need to figure this one out
4 letter words are all you said
5 minutes later we're in bed
Can't count you to love me
But
I can't count the days since you've been gone

Ever since I saw you
There was no one else
Just you and me, you were all that I could see
But I got this problem
Don't know how to stay
What I mean, What I mean...

We've got one time, time to get this right
2 times and you know it's not my style
3's company, just you and me
We need to figure this one out

We've got one time, time to get this right
2 times and you know it's not my style
3's company, just you and me
We need to figure this one out
4 letter words are all you said
5 minutes later we're in bed
Can't count you to love me
But
I can't count the days since you've been gone
Wake up, go to work
Come home, it's not working
We've been living our whole lives
On a system that is broken...
