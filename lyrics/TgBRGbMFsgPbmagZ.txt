I'm a match, she's kerosene
You know she's gonna burn down everything
She's an arsonist in her pass time
And I've been burned for the last time
Time, time, time, woah
I've been burned for the last time
Time, time, time, woah
I've been burned for the last time

It started out like any other morning
The sky was red, he took it as a warning
She hit the hive now the bees are swarming
He played the victim till the crowd starts forming
She's got a history of making a scene, yeah
She tells a story, she gets started like
He's the executioner and she's the queen
And he's the one whose neck is in the guillotine, he says

I'm a match, she's kerosene
You know she's gonna burn down everything
She's an arsonist in her pass time
And I've been burned for the last time
Time, time, time, woah
I've been burned for the last time
Time, time, time, woah
I've been burned for the last time

The smoke clears out when he's been awaken
He said this life could be mine for the taking
She need a drink so she starts shaking
And played a victim til his heart stops breaking
No real tears cause she don't mean it
This landscape used to be so scenic
And he could make it out if he could dream it
Rising up from the ash, he's a phoenix

I'm a match, she's kerosene
You know she's gonna burn down everything
She's an arsonist in her pass time
And I've been burned for the last time
Time, time, time, woah
I've been burned for the last time
Time, time, time, woah
I've been burned for the last time

You play with me, you're playing with fire
You play with me, you're playing with fire

I'm a match, she's kerosene
You know she's gonna burn down everything
She's an arsonist in her pass time
And I've been burned for the last time
Time, time, time, woah
I've been burned for the last time
Time, time, time, woah
I've been burned for the last time
