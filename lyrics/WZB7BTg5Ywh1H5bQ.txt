People say they've got minds of their own
They'll get sucked in - then they'll know
They get brainwashed into doing things
Things that they never really believed
Get up fight back - take a stand
Time is now - take a stand
Before it's too late - take a stand
Get up fight back
They hear - they see - take a stand
They're looking for an easy way out
Got to make sure they don't sap the will from you
Got to make sure they don't make a fool out of you
Get up fight back - take a stand
Time is now - take a stand
Before it's too late - take a stand
Get up fight back

You've got to - take a stand
Until you die - take a stand
In my grave - take a stand
I'll never give in - take a stand
