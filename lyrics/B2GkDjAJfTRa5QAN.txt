My heart skips skips skips, skips skips skips a beat

I can see you're not yourself
Even when you're here with me
I know that you're somewhere else

So put another record on
Kiss and lead me on
Nothing really matters when we're dancing
Listen to the same sad song playing on repeat
Cause every time we come this close

My heart skips, skips a beat
So come on, spin me around
Now, I don't wanna go home
Cause when you hold me like this
You know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone

And when you hold me like this
That's when my heart skips, skips a beat
Oh oh oh, oh oh!

So hung up, we can't let go
If you really have to leave
One more time just move me slow
So put another record on
Play it on repeat
Nothing really matters when we're dancing

Cause all you ever need to know
Is what you do to me
That every time you hold me close
My heart skips, skips a beat
So come on, spin me around
Now, I don't wanna go home

Cause when you hold me like this
You know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone
And when you hold me like this
That's when my heart skips, skips a beat
Oh oh oh, oh oh!

Hey, you make my heart skip a beat like
Hey lady let me take you out to eat like
Uh I'm fittin' to knock it out the park girl
So put your boyfriend on, three strikes
Outta here, greedy I don't gotta share
We gon' be up til the morning we don't gotta care
I'ma sit back and play my cards like solitaire
You and your friends come with us, like we outta there
Olly Murs, Chiddy yea!

So come on, spin me around

I don't wanna go home
Cause when you hold me like this
You know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone
And when you hold me like this
That's when my heart skips, skips a beat
Oh oh oh, oh oh! Heart skips, skips a beat.
Oh oh oh, oh oh!
My heart skips, skips a beat
