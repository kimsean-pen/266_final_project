There's magic in the water that attracts all men
Across hills and down streams
The turning of the tide
Outlook
Future bright
Selfish
Beauty shines
Light cloud rain drive on
13 years to this day red planet aligned
Into sight 60, 000 years of light
Fascination with a mountain put to sea
Built to slay and conquer
All with teeth of beasts
