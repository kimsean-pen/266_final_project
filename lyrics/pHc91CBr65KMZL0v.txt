The party fell out of the window
Laughing like a Marvel hero
Now they're down playing the street
The winter's biting out their feet
The old cathedral bell still rings
And children love to laugh and sing
Love to scream and play the game
Before they be what they became
I light the silver candle
Stare out the two-pane window
That smoke escaping through the chimney
I have lost the gifts they tried to give me
Oh, they never went too far
I'm praying to some distant star
To tell me how things really are
Some forgotten causes how it seems
Though simple, still achieve their dreams
I only had my way
Life would be filled with summer days
But it's when tonight that tries to teach
Meanings that lie just out of reach
The message is the simple one
Only got by certain ones
The ones who breathe this atmosphere
If that's not you, try not to fear
You'll be left with many friends down here
