What do you think of that?
I'm sleeping down at the laundromat
If you should pass by be sure to drop my bag
Come 'round and meet my friends
They'll be there with me right through to the end
Right through to the end
Right through to the end

What do you think of that?
I'm sleeping down at the laundromat
If you should pass you should drop my bag

But I don't have no clothes to clean,
to put inside the machine
It was the craziest place I've ever been

Oh, come around and meet my friends
They'll be there with me right through to the end

Say I told you so

Maybe bad times come and go
You don't know that right now but then you'll never know

What do you think of that
I'm on the street like an old stray cat
If you should look for me you'd know exactly where to go

Oh, come around and meet my friends
They'll be there with me, with me to the end

What do you think of that
I'm sleeping down at the laundromat
If you should pass by drop right in

But I have no clothes to clean
To put inside the machine
It was the craziest place I've ever been

Oh, come around and meet my friends
They'll be there with me right through to the end
