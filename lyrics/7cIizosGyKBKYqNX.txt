I know, I know
The doors won't close
The pipes all froze
Just let it go

I know, I know
(Argue with me)
The doors won't close
(I've got plenty)
The pipes are froze
(of dishes and time)
Just let it go
(cords in a bind)

I know, I know
(knots that we make)
The doors won't close
(fatal mistakes)
The pipes are froze
(let's recreate)
Just let it go
(an easier time)

I still can't find you
'Cause I still can't find you
