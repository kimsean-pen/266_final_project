Someone died
Gun-shot, right outside
Your father, he's dead
I see him in my head
Childhood's End
Goodbye, my holy friend
Love me, it's a sin
Can you see me caving in?

Went down, went down, went down
Went down, went down, went down
It's went down, went down, went down
On me, me, me
Me, me, me
Me, me, me
Me, me, me
Yeah

Brother's feel
Killing time standing in the field
Our fate, it is sealed
At birth we made a deal
I don't cry
God tell me why
Love death
Night flight
Best friend crucified

Went down, went down, went down
Went down, went down, went down
It's went down, went down, went down
On me, me, me
Me, me, me
Me, me, me
Me, me, me
Yeah

Won't someone come home
Won't someone come home
Won't someone come home
Won't someone come home
Won't someone for me, me, me
Me, me, me
Me, me, me
Me, me, me
Yeah
