I'm alive
I feel it now
I never knew I'll find it on you
Out of line we got ourselves
In a look, wait we are not fine
Wait, you are not mine!

We find our eyes stuck looking at
Our eyes are making out
We're not made for this
Fighting love
Our eyes stuck looking at
Our eyes are making out
We're too close to be out of touch!
Out of touch, ooh oh

Out of touch
Lay away, quiet corner
Side by side, we follow our minds
Walk it on, then we trip
On the line, wait we are not fine

Wait, you are not mine!
We find Our eyes stuck looking at
Our eyes are making out
We're not made for this
Fighting love
Our eyes stuck looking at
Our eyes are making out
We're too close to be out of touch!
Our eyes stuck looking at
Our eyes are making out
We're not made for this
Fighting love

Our eyes stuck looking at

Our eyes are making out
We're too close to be out of touch!
I can't stay low
I'm always glad when we wake up
I'm just as there as you
So, when we wake up
I can't stay low
I'm always glad when we wake up

I'm just as there as you
So, when we wake up
Our eyes stuck looking at
Our eyes are making out
We're not made for this
Fighting love

Our eyes stuck looking at
Our eyes are making out
We're too close to be out of touch!
Our eyes stuck looking at
Our eyes are making out
We're not made for this
Fighting love
Our eyes stuck looking at
Our eyes are making out
We're too close to be out of touch!
Oh oh, out of touch
Oh oh, out of touch
Out of touch
