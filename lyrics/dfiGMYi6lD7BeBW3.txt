Bo, bo-bee, bo-bee, bo
Bo, bo-bee, bo-bee, bo

I couldn't bear to be special
I couldn't bear
Couldn't bear
I couldn't bear
Right?

Bo, bo-bee, bo-bee, bo

So, don't look at me and say
That I'm the very one
Who makes the cornball things occur
The shiver of the fur

Don't expect so much of me
I'm just an also-ran
There's a mile between the way you see me
And the way I am
So don't stare at me that way
Of course it gives me pride
But I won't take on the risk
Of letting down the sweet, sweet side
Did you mean to humble me?
So you did it unsuspectingly
Oh words are trains
For moving past what really has no name

Bo, bo-bee, bo-bee, bo
Bo, bo-bee, bo-bee, bo

I couldn't bear to be special
I couldn't bear
Couldn't bear

So don't look at me and say
That I'm the very one
Who makes the cornball things occur
The shiver of the fur
Right?

Boo, ba-bah
Boo-boo, ba-bah
Boo-boo...
