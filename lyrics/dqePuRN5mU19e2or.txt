Staring at the mirror through your hair
You can't see everything that you did to me
With your automatic eyes, five years disappeared
Five years disappeared that night

Do you want me to stay, do you want me to go?
Do you think I recognize
The look on your face when you think that I know?
Blinded as the shades draw closed
Time's up for us
Would you want me to go if you knew what I know?
If you knew what I know

Staring at the wall above the bed
I can't sleep with all the secrets that you keep
With your automatic eyes,
Five years disappeared
Five years disappeared that night

Do you want me to stay, do you want me to go?
Do you think I recognize
The look on your face when you think that I know?
Blinded as the shades draw closed
Time's up for us
Would you want me to go if you knew what I know?
If you knew what I know

Do you want me to stay, do you want me to go?
Do you think I recognize
The look on your face when you think that I know?
Blinded as the shades draw closed
Time's up for us
Would you want me to go if you knew what I know?
Do you want me to stay, do you want me to go?
Do you want me to stay, do you want me to go?
Do you want me to stay, do you want me to go?
Do you want me to stay, do you want me to go?
If you knew what I know
