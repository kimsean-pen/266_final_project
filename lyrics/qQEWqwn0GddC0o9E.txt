Dry eyes, roaring falls, God knows I've travelled far,
So far, but this is where it ends.
Found you, right about the time that you found me,
For once I was doing something right!
Night fell, you asked.

Are you lost in paradise my love or have you found a home,
It's an awfully lonely road to walk alone?
But as I searched your flashing indigo eyes, it echoed true, that I loved you.

Dawn woke; I knew that it was time for my return,
But this time it would likely hurt as hell.
Sometimes, way across the ocean on a far away shore we both stand and we both call, both call â€“

That if you give love and live love, then you'll never be alone,
That if you give love and live love then you'll always have a home.

We were lost in the field trading tales of home,
But everyone knew that your gaze was my home.
