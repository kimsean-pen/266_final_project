There you are with your college friends
You played in their marching band
I can't help but wish I knew you then
But I guess I know you now
It looks as if I stumbled right into the palm of your hand

Hey, you
Hey, Mr. Knock-On-My-Door
I'm sorry that I've been emotions galore
Am I crazy for wantin' a little bit more?
A little more of you
A little more, a little more of you

This feelin's hard to ignore
Please, say you'll never get bored
Can you blame me for wantin' a little bit more?
A little more of you
A little more, a little more of you

Say that it's the same
Take a drill right to my brain
Oh, the way you did just yesterday
I guess I get it now
It looks as if I stumbled right into the palm of your hand

Hey, you
Hey, Mr. Knock-On-My-Door
I'm sorry that I've been emotions galore
Am I crazy for wantin' a little bit more?
A little more of you
A little more, a little more of you

This feelin's hard to ignore
Please, say you'll never get bored
Can you blame me for wantin' a little bit more?
A little more of you
A little more, a little more of you

Hey yeah, hey yeah
Ooh
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Ooh
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Ooh
Hey yeah, hey yeah

A little more of you
A little more, a little more of you
