I'd swim across lake Michigan
I'd sell my shoes
I'd give my body to be back again
In the rest of the room

To be alone with you
To be alone with you
To be alone with you
To be alone with you

You gave your body to the lonely
They took your clothes
You gave up a wife and a family
You gave your ghost

To be alone with me
To be alone with me
To be alone with me
You went up on a tree
Aah, aah, aah

To be alone with me
You went up on the tree
Aah, aah, aah
I've never known the man who loved me
Aah, aah, aah
