Let me breathe for you.
Let me know you too.
Let me take the pain from you.
Oh...

And let me see you through your eyes
I will be at your side.
I'll surround you
And protect you.

Let me glow with you
And I will cut all the blues
To decorate your room.
Oh...

Let us consciously decide
That we will be each others guides
To navigate the room.
Oh...

Ooh...
Aah...
Ooh...
Aah...

Let me breathe for you.
