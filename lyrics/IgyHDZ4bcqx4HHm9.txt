How come you never k ow what you've got until it's gone
Too bad cause I never felt so good with anyone
How fool was I in the thinking I was gonna be alright, OK, fine

So everyday I fight a little harder to forget her
I lie here, convince myself tomorrow will be better

The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind when I close my eyes at night
Who's gonna save me now she's gone
The trouble is there's a part of me that still can't let go of her memory
And now I know what it is
Love is what the trouble is
Love is what the trouble is

How come she said you never wear you're heart where I can see
Too bad cause now I'm the one who's sorry
How stupid was I in the thinking I was gonna be alright, OK, fine

So everyday I find a little something to remind me
No matter how I'll try, can't put the past behind me

The trouble is I can't get her out of my mind when I close my eyes at night
Who's gonna save me now she's gone
The trouble is there's a part of me that still can't let go of her memory
Now I know what it is

Love has left me lonely
I'm alright, I'm OK, I'll be fine, give it time
But the only

Trouble is I can't get her out of my mind when I close my eyes at night
Who's gonna save me now she's gone
The trouble is there's a part of me that still can't let go of her memory
And now I know what it is
Now I know what it is
Cause love is what the trouble is
Love is what the trouble is
