Took a car to Rio
Cross the border to Mexico
Ten hours straight down to the sea
And my heart was racin'
'Cause I know that you'll be waitin'
Same time and place we always meet

Outside, drinking, the moonlight
You fill up all night, my fantasies
Outside, stars are in your eyes
We're dancing all night, more memories

One more time, under the Salinas skies
As I hold you in these arms of mine
One more time, under the Salinas skies

Never mind siesta
We can start our own fiesta
We're the only ones left on the beach
Foamy like the ocean
Let me drown in your emotions
I'm ready to learn if you will teach

Outside, drinking, the moonlight
You fill up all night, my fantasies
Outside, stars are in your eyes
We're dancing all night, more memories

One more time, under the Salinas skies
As I hold you in these arms of mine
One more time, let's celebrate our love tonight
I can tell by the look in your eyes

Next year-ear
We'll be right here-ere
We'll meet again-ain
No sad goodbyes
One more time, under the Salinas skies

One more time, under the Salinas skies
As I hold you in these arms of mine
One more time, let's celebrate our love tonight
I can tell by the look in your eyes

Next year-ear
We'll be right here-ere
We'll meet again-ain
No sad goodbyes
One more time, under the Salinas skies
