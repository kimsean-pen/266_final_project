Your home is where you're happy
It's not where you're not free
Your home is where you can be what you are
'Cause you were just born to be
Now they'll show you their castles
And diamonds for all to see
But they'll never show you that peace of mind
'Cause they don't know how to be free
So burn all your bridges
Leave your old life behind
You can do what you want to do
'Cause you're strong in your mind
And anywhere you might wander
You can make that your home
And as long as you got love in your heart
You'll never be alone
Just as long as you got love in your heart
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
