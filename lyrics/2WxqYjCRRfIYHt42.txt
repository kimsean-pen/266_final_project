There's no point in asking
You'll get no reply
Oh just remember I don't decide
I got no reason it's all too much

'Cos we're not all there
Oh don't pretend 'cos I don't care
I don't believe illusions 'cos too much is real
So stop your cheap comment
'Cos we know what we feel

Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
We're vacant
Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
Vacant

Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
Ah but now
And we don't care

There's no point in asking
You'll get no reply
Oh just remember I don't decide
I got no reason it's all too much

We're pretty a-pretty vacant
We're pretty a-pretty vacant
And we don't care
