Here in a church, a small boy is kneeling
He prays to a god, he does not know, he cannot feel
All of his sins of childhood he will remember
He will not cry, tears he will not cry

Man of sorrows, I won't see your face
Man of sorrows, you left without a trace
A small boy wonders, what was it all about?
Is your journey over - has it just begun?

A vision of a new world, from the ashes of the old
"Do what thou wilt!", he screams from his cursed soul
A tortured seer, a prophet of our emptiness
Wondering why, wondering why...

Man of sorrows, I won't see your face
Man of sorrows, you left without a trace
A small boy wonders, what was it all about?
Is your journey over - has it just begun?

A man of sorrows racked, with thoughts that dare not
speak their name
trapped inside a body, made to feel only guilt and shame
His anger all his life -"I hate myself!", he cried
"Do what thou wilt! - do what thou wilt!", he cried

Man of sorrows, I won't see your face
Man of sorrows, you left without a trace
A small boy wonders, what was it all about?
Is your journey over - has it just begun?

Man of sorrows, I won't see your face
Man of sorrows, you left without a trace
A small boy wonders, what was it all about?
Is your journey over - has it just begun?
