I'm waiting for you baby
it's time for show and tell
A prisoner I was captured
I'm under your spell.
I want to be your woman
come on and be my man.
This feeling that I have for you
I understand.

Passion... Passion...

This dream of love is restless
it really is so strong.
I want to give you all my love
before it's too far gone.
Our love is like a lion
it's hungry for it's prey.
Come on and show your lovin'
I really can wait.
