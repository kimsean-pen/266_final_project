We said we want
We said we wanna get a little bit lighter
Continuing our reach to be higher
You know we all need a little bit of love
Standing above what's been done
The world is shaking and we're all under fire
So concerned who's pointing the gun
Will you believe what we all can become
Standing above what's been done

To lead is to leave
Your hands on the heat
Feed me, she screams from the screen
"Shield us, shape us"
This is the first thing we need
A future comprised
Of two threads and a needle
Injuries, empathy
All will be healed
Will we produce or enslave
Procreate or erase?

We said we want
We said we wanna get a little bit lighter
Continuing our reach to be higher
You know we all need a little bit of love
Standing above what's been done
The world is shaking and we're all under fire
So concerned who's pointing the gun
Will you believe what we all can become
Standing above what's been done

Hit the marker, have your feet catch
Ears up to hear the trigger snap
One in front of the other
Every hurdle I wonder
Are we moving backwards or forward?
