And this a protoje
Chronixx a weh you say
Ok, (oh well)
Who knows, who knows, who knows, who knows
I just go where the trade winds blows
Sending love to my friends and foes
And I suppose I'm pleased
To be chilling in the West Indies
Jah provide all my wants and needs
I got the sunshine rivers and trees
Green leaves oh yea
When me see jah me see a way
Drastically stray from hiprocrosy I say (yea)
Every man to they own philosopy
I live the proper way and then mi read a chapter a day
Man deh in a city hungry and nuh eat
And food deh down a country just a drop off a di trees dem
You say proverty nuh real den
Is what the reasoning revealing
Who knows, who knows, who knows, who knows
I just go where the trade winds blows
Sending love to my friends and foes
And I suppose I'm pleased
To be chilling in the West Indies
Jah provide all my wants and needs
I got the sunshine rivers and trees
Green leaves oh yea
When the rain pitta pat pon the roof
Herb just a steam pepper pot pon the still
Life is a dream if you got gratitude
Go tell the regime dem can't stop what we do now
Information you think on your own
Or else you are a slave to the things that you know
What do you know if you learn everyday
So be careful a things weh you say
Who knows, who knows, who knows, who knows
I just go where the trade winds blows
Sending love to my friends and foes
And I suppose I'm pleased
To be chilling in the West Indies
Jah provide all my wants and needs
I got the sunshine rivers and trees
Green leaves oh yea
Africa in a we soul but a Jah in a we heart
Its of importance for i n i fi gather
If we cannot show now a balance that we had
How do we proposed now to carry it abroad
Cannot go to ethipoia and don't have a plan
The building of a nation a hand a help a hand
Everyone a love a one, every man is just a man
It shall be a coronation when we land, land, land
Who knows, who knows, who knows, who knows
I just go where the trade winds blows
Sending love to my friends and foes
And I suppose I'm pleased
To be chilling in the West Indies
Jah provide all my wants and needs
I got the sunshine rivers and trees
Green leaves oh yea
Who knows, who knows, who knows, who knows
Am pleased to be chilling in the West Indies
Jah provide all my wants and needs
