Goodbye weekend, so long darling
Macky's been a bad bad boy
And when their preaching is sure to change me
Should rearrange me or so they thought

So don't go telling me how this boy should be leaving his own life
Sometimes rough but generally speaking I'm fine
If you don't agree with the things that go on within in my life
Well honey that's fine there's no itch in wasting your time

Suddenly, place me, give me a sign
Repeat the metra when you're stepping out of line
Give me another, something to be
May help out the country boy but it won't work out on me

So don't go telling me how this boy should be leaving his own life
Sometimes rough but generally speaking I'm fine
If you don't agree with the things that go on within in my life
Well honey that's fine there's no itch in wasting your time

So don't go telling me how this boy should be leaving his own life
Sometimes rough but generally speaking I'm fine
If you don't agree with the things that go on within in my life
Well honey that's fine there's no itch in wasting your time
