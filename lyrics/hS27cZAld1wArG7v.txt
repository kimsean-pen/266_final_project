We're from mister 305, dade county
Mister worldwide, all around the world (hey, hey)
We're international, so international
International, so international

You can't catch me boy
I'm overseas at about a 100g's for sho'
Don't test me boy
'Cause I rap with the best for sho'
305 til the death of me
Cremate my body let the ocean have what's left of me
But for now forget about that
Blow the whistle baby you the referee

You put it down like New York City
I never sleep
Wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat
Oh Miss International Love (Girl is)
Oh Miss International Love

I don't play football but I've touched down everywhere
(Everywhere) everywhere
I don't play baseball but I've hit a home run everywhere, everywhere
I've been to countries and cities I can't pronounce
And the places on the globe I didn't know existed
In Romania she pulled me to the centre
She said, "Pit you can have me and my sister"
In Lebanon yeah the women are bomb
And in Greece you've guessed it the women are sweet
Been all around the world but I ain't gon' lie
There's nothing like Miami's heat

You put it down like New York City
I never sleep
Wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat
Oh Miss International Love (Girl is)
Oh Miss International Love

Down in DR they looking for visa's
I ain't talking credit cards if you know what I mean
En Cuba la cosa 'ta dura
All the women get down if you know what I mean
In Colombia the women got everything done
With some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen
In Brazil they freaky with big ol' booties
And they thongs blue, yellow and green
In LA tengo all las Mexicanas
In New York tengo all las Boricua
Besitos para todas las mujeres en Venezuela
Muah, y en Miami tengo cualquiera

You put it down like New York City
I never sleep
Wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat
Oh Miss International Love
Oh Miss International Love

There's not a place
That your love don't affect me baby
So don't ever change
I cross the globe when I'm with you baby

Hey
Chris Brown
This for the women worldwide
Let's ride

You put it down like New York City
I never sleep
Wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat
Oh Miss international love
Oh Miss international love

You put it down like New York City
I never sleep
Wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat
Oh Miss International Love
Oh Miss International Love

Ooo-oo-ohhh (We're international, so international)
Ooo-oo-ohhh (International, so international)
Ooo-oo-ohhh (We're international, so international)
Whoa-whoa- oh whoa-whoa--oh international love
Whoa-whoa- oh whoa-whoa--oh international love
