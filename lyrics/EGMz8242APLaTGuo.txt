We're leaving today
After dust-ridden shutters close
And heartbeats they rush
Then to cease in your embrace

These scars though-out the night
Left no more fighting in us
No tears to fill the void
In a place even devils fled

The wretched tongues
Wording their pain on to me
Until even tide enters
There's no place out of here

(For grace to life me up every molecule
whispered to make peace with the unreality
I felt I was slipping downwards
into darkness
...and in darkness I stayed
until sadness closed its eyes)

Ships passing in the silvery night,
Carrying this vicious, benevolent heart
And in sadness we part...
In the dark of you, in the dark of me

(Release these hearts from the turmoil)

Tired and cold,
A tale since eons of old...
So elusive this intemperance of escape

So much has fallen and is falling still
Into the hands of the ever madding crowd

So we're leaving today
As dust-ridden shutters close
To site that glimmer of hope
And breathe, if only for a while

These stars that turned the tide
Left no more fighting in use
No hope to find the dawn
In a place even specters dwell

Ships passing in the silvery night,
Carrying this vicious, benevolent heart
And in sadness we part...
In the dark of you, in the dark of me

(Release these hearts from the turmoil!
Only Love before they drown...)

Tired and cold,
A tale since eons of old...
So elusive this intemperance of escape

So much has fallen and is falling still
Into the hands of the ever madding crowd
