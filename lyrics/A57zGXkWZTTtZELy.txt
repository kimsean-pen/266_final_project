Now drop yourself with no concern
On how to breathe
When your mind is burned
On optimistic, on overload
Can we shift the heat back
To when your heart's grown cold

In severed light
Our souls are damaged
And with that caged
To the cause of light
Now I can see
Another language
Gone optimistic
We're gonna survive

We're the tail-end of the sun
To a greener hideaway
Where in peace I found my fun
Till I heard the future say

I'm in an army, a megaquake
A force of nature
All hell ashake
Improve our days now, cause we might not sleep tonight
Suffused are we to the cause of light!

On optimistic
On overload
Can we shift the heat back
To when your heart's grown cold
And now we know why
And know what we must do
Aware of the cracks
The heart shines through

We're the tail-end of the sun
To a greener hideaway
Where in peace I found my fun
Till I heard the future say

We're the tail-end of the sun
To a greener hideaway
Where in peace I found my fun
Till I heard the future...

(Would you believe my life was so fine)
A bed of roses
And rollercoasters
(Would you believe my life was all right)
A bed of roses
And rollercoasters
A bed of roses
And rollercoasters
