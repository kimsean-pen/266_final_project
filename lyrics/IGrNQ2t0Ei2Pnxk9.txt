Look at your life, my father. What have you done?
In sixty years of living in shame and steady being on the run
And what you tell your sons and daughters. What do you fear?
I know who will hear your prayer when the end is near

They're calling you a sinner
Since the day you're born
And wrote it in your mind
But still you've got a chance to turn
Or live a lie

What about you, mother. Why were you weeping every night?
Thought it kept you on the tracks, always been by your side
What were the things that you've been dreaming of?
Where could you have been without the celestial one?

They're calling you a sinner
Since the day you're born
And wrote it in your mind
But still you've got a chance to turn
Or live a lie

Entering this holy house
Feel safe from the one below
But are you really pure in the eyes of your god?
Or is it just another show
Let me read in your eyes
See the bottom of your soul

You've never been a sinner, maybe you're not the only one
The world it won't be shaking and burning on that day when you're gone
You'll never see the things that you've been dreaming of
As long as you are bound to all these empty words

They're calling you a sinner
Since the day you're born
And wrote it in your mind
But still you've got a chance to turn
Or live a lie
