Let the stillborn come to me
Their souls shall melt into a mass of death
Commence the ritual beyond the veil of life
Poison my heart, shred my veins

Claws of death
Cold light blind my eyes
Call upon the undead
Blazing inferno
Powers that be
Dragging me further down...

Fixed on the altar
Come forth
Belial

Inject
Dead blood

Jaws of old
Gaping in the abyss
Calling out for fettered souls
Feeding the darkness
This rotting life
Death will witness our ordeal
