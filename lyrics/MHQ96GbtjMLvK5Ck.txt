Always wanting you, but never having you,
Makes it hard to face tomorrow 'cause I
Know I'll wake up wanting you again.
Always loving you, but never touching you,
Sometimes hurts me almost more than I can stand.

I'd been better off if I'd turned away and never
Looked at you the second time.
'Cause I really had my life all together till your eyes meet mine.

And there I saw a yearning and a feeling 'cross
The room that you felt for me.
Wish I'd had a way of knowing that the things we had in
Mind could never be.

Always wanting you, but never having you,
Makes it hard to face tomorrow 'cause I
Know I'll wake up wanting you again.
Always loving you, but never touching you,
Sometimes hurts me almost more than I can stand.
