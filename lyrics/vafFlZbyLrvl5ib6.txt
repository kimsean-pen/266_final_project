A certain shade of green
Tell me is that what you mean?
All signs around
They say move ahead
Could someone please explain to me
Your ever present lack of speed

Are your muscles bound by ropes
Or do crutches cloud your day
My sources say the road is clear
And street signs point the way

You gonna stand around 'til 2012 AD?
What are you waiting for?
A certain shade of green
I think I grew a gray watching you procrastinate
What are you waiting for?
A certain shade of green!

Would a written invitation
Signed choose now or lose it all?
Sedate your hesitation
Or inflame and make you stall

You've been raised in limitation
But that glove never fit quite right
The time has passed for hand me downs
Choose a new
Please evolve
Take flight

You gonna stand around 'til 2012 AD?
What are you waiting for?
A certain shade of green!
I think I grew a gray watching you procrastinate

Green...
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
A written invitation?
A public declaration?
A private consolation?
Remember when you...

I think I grew a gray watching you... procrastinate!

You gonna stand around 'til 2012 AD?
What are you waiting for?
A certain shade of green!
I think I grew a gray watching you procrastinate

What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for...
