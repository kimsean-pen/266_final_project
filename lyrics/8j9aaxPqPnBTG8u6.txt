I'm all out of place
It's raining on this race
You're all out of place my babe
It's written on your face, oh-oh

Bring yourselves to me
I'm not afraid to hit them
Bring yourselves to me
I'm not afraid to hit them

You kept me waiting
I'll count to five first
How do you feel?
I want

Oh alright, let this fable
The seams becoming clear
But can you feel the heat in here?
The sweat of my tears, mm

I'll keep you waiting
Make your move first
You kept me waiting
I'll count to five first
How do you feel?
I want
I'm hungry for you

I'll keep you waiting
Tell me how to bleed
Make your move first
I'll give you time to change
You kept me waiting
Tell me how to bleed
I'll count to five first
I'll give you time to change

I'll keep you waiting
I'll keep you waiting
Make your move first
Oh, make your move first
You kept me waiting
I'll keep you waiting
I'll count to five first

How do you feel?
I want you
