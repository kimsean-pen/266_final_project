Holding ties to each other
I felt the empty space
One more try to remember
The look in your velvet face

There's only dreams now
There's all these lies now

Holding lights to a canvas
That's only steps away
I sometimes can't remember
Those looks your velvet gave

Cuz man
There's only dreams now
There's all these lies now
I'm holding on now

Then I'm not so sure
Not so sure
Not so sure about it

I wanna dance in the courtyard
I wanna dance while holding you
I wanna dance in the courtyard
I wanna dance while holding you
I wanna dance in the courtyard
I wanna dance while holding you

There's more time now
There only dreams now
There's only lies now
I'm holding on now

I'm not so sure
Not so sure
Not so sure about it
Then I'm not so sure
Not so sure
Not so sure about it

Not so sure
Not so sure
Not so sure about it
And I'm not so sure
Not so sure
Not so sure without you
I'm not so sure
Not so sure
Not so sure about it
And I'm not so sure
Not so sure
Not sure without you
Without you
