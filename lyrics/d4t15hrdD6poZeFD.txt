Your cheatin' heart
Will make you weep
You'll cry and cry
And try to sleep

But sleep won't come
The whole night through
Your cheatin' heart
Will tell on you

When tears come down
Like fallin' rain
You'll toss around
And call my name

You'll walk the floor
(You'll walk the floor)
The way I do
(The way I do)

Your cheatin' heart
(Your cheatin' heart)
Will tell on you
(Will tell on you)

When tears come down
Like fallin' rain
You'll toss around
And call my name

You're gonna walk the floor
(You'll walk the floor)
The very way I do
(The way I do)

Your cheatin' heart
(Your cheatin' heart)
Is gonna tell on you
(Will tell on you)
