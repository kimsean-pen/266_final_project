Every rich white kid's got something to say
Shut the fuck up

First world problem child
Yo, you lost your way
Born on easy street
Never step foot on MLK

Easy living in your position
With a white last name
Pre-conditioned to be the villain
Another suburban day

Every rich white kid's got something to say
Shut the fuck up
(First world problem child)
Every rich white kid's got something to say
Shut the fuck up
(First world problem child)

Fortunate and favored
You spit the same old flavor
You can use a taste of another race
What's it like to be your neighbor?

Knock knock, coming in hot
We don't need the key, we can break the lock
To your gated house, show the sheltered the real shit
Bring the mother fucking truth out

First world problem child
Step in their shoes, and walk a mile
First world problem child
Step in their shoes, and walk a mile

I'm a surgeon with a switch blade
I'll cut you see if you still bleed
You wouldn't know a problem
Cause you got everything you need

I got iron in my arteries
You got a wall between yourself and reality
Show the sheltered the real shit
Bring the motherfucking truth out
(Bring the motherfucking truth out)

Show the sheltered the real shit
Bring the motherfucking truth out
(Bring the motherfucking truth out)

Every rich white kid's got something to say
Shut the fuck up
