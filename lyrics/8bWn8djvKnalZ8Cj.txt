Let's not pretend
We're not a loose cannon ending
And I tried to take it backwards and it wasn't enough
Ooh, not thinking 'bout you

So when I come try you out
Like a drink I tasted once
That I set aside no thinking 'cause it wasn't enough
Ooh, not thinking 'bout you
Ooh, not thinking 'bout you

Some fire's burning, breathe in
Clear the smoke from my lungs
In a stare down conversation where you don't make a sound
And it's lost all of the meaning 'cause it wasn't enough
Ooh, not thinking 'bout you

But can I come try you out?
(So you said it was good, so it's good till it's gone)
But can I come try you out?
(So we're dead to the feeling and gone in the morning)
And it's lost all of the meaning 'cause it wasn't enough
Ooh, not thinking 'bout you

Ooh, not thinking 'bout
Not thinking 'bout
So you said it was good, now it's good that it's gone
Not thinking 'bout you

So when I come try you out
Like a drink I tasted once
That I set aside not thinking 'cause it wasn't enough
Ooh, I'm not thinking 'bout you

So when I come try you out
So when I come try you out
And it's lost all of the meaning 'cause it wasn't enough
Ooh, not thinking 'bout you

Ooh
Ooh, not thinking 'bout you.
