3 a.m. and all my friends are looking at me sideways
Give me a minute
Maybe I'm too drunk and I'm not doing this the right way
But let me finish

I'm so happy that you're happy with her, wait that's a lie
Almost called or tried to text you like a million times
3 a.m. but I don't care I had to tell you someday
The way I'm feeling

I can still feel you
You're everywhere
I can taste your lips
Hear your voice in my head
And I know that I should shut my mouth
And just hang up the phone
But I still want you
I just thought you should know

Bet you're in the kitchen hoping she don't hear you whisper
Just a minute
Do you ever think of me when you lean in to kiss her
Do you miss it? Oh

'Cause I can still feel you
You're everywhere
I can taste your lips
Hear your voice in my head
And I know that I should shut my mouth
And just hang up the phone
But I still want you
I just thought you should know

I just thought, I just thought
I just thought, I just thought
I just thought you should know
I just thought, I just thought
I just thought, I just thought

I'm so happy that you're happy with her, wait that's a lie (oh)
Almost called or tried to text you like a million times

I can still feel you
You're everywhere
I can taste your lips
Hear your voice in my head
And I know that I should shut my mouth
And just hang up the phone
But I still want you, oh

I can still feel you
You're everywhere
I can taste your lips
Hear your voice in my head
And I know that I should shut my mouth
And just hang up the phone
But I still want you

I just thought you should know
I just thought, I just thought
I just thought, I just thought
I just thought you should know
I just thought, I just thought
I just thought, I just thought

Don't wanna be without you
Don't wanna be without you, baby
I just thought you should know
I just thought, I just thought
