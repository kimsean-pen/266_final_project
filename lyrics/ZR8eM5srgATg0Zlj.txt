Bow down I'm invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes
This time I will take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight

Believe me, you've never met a motherfucker like me
Bet you've never seen the things that I've seen
Bottled up inside
This time I'm taking back my life

I'm rising up
I've had enough

I'm feeling invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes
This time I will take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight
I'm feeling invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes
This time I will take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight

I'll break you, in a hundred different ways and I'll make you
Remember my face
Thought that I would let you leave?
It's hard to stop what you can't see

I'm rising up
I've had enough

I'm feeling invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes
This time I will take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight
I'm feeling invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes
This time I will take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight

Bow down I'm invincible tonight
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes
This time I will take you for a ride
I'm invincible

I will waste you (Invincible)
When you can't escape me now (Invincible)
I will break (Invincible)
You down (Invincible)

I'm feeling invincible tonight
Take your time
Take a look into my eyes
This time I will take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight
I'm feeling invincible tonight (Invincible)
I'm alive
Take a look into my eyes (Invincible)
This time (Invincible)
I will take you for a ride
I'm invincible tonight
Invincible
Invincible
Invincible
