City, city of Satan
City, city of Satan

Oh, let me tell you about a city known as Satan
City, city of Satan
Where all the people look so good, you gotta hate them
City, city of Satan

But when you feel it and your blood runs hot
You gotta keep on rockin', give it what you got
In the city, city of Satan, city, city of Satan

A thousand years of lies and still they gotta fake it
City, city of Satan
You gotta wear a mask if you wanna make it
City, city of Satan

But when you feel it and your blood runs hot
You gotta keep on rockin, give it what you got
In the city, city of Satan, city, city of Satan

You don't really wanna go there
You don't really wanna make it, go home
Put your make up on, make your hair real pretty
And meet me tonight down in Satan's city

Oh, Satan's city, boy I gave you all my leather
(Yes I did)
Oh, Satan's city, man you gave me stormy weather

But when you feel it and your blood runs hot
You gotta keep on rockin', give it what you got
In the city, city of Satan, city, city of Satan

Everybody now, city, city of Satan
Everybody now, city, city of Satan

You don't really wanna go there
You don't really wanna make it, go home
Put your make up on, make your hair real pretty
And meet me tonight down in Satan's city

Spend the night forever

Ooh, ooh, ooh woo, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh woo, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh woo, ooh
