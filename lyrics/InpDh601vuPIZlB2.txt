Underneath our feet

Crystals grow like plants
(listen how they grow)
I'm blinded by the lights
(listen how they grow)
In the core of the earth

(listen how they grow)
Crystalline
Internal Nebula
(Crystalline)
Rocks growing slowmo
(Crystalline)
I conquer claustrophobia
(Crystalline)

And demand the light
We mimic the openness
Of the warmth we love
Doth till our generosity equalize the flow
With our hearts
We kiss all quartz

To reach love
Crystalline
Internal Nebula
(crystalline)
Rocks growing slowmo
(crystalline)
I conquer claustrophobia
(crystalline)

And demand the light
Octagon, polygon

Pipes up an organ
Sonic branches
Murmuring drone

Crystallizing galaxies
Spread out like my fingers
Crystalline
Internal Nebula
(crystalline)
Rocks growing slowmo
(crystalline)
I conquer claustrophobia

(crystalline)
And demand the light
Internal Nebula
(crystalline)
Rocks growing slowmo
(crystalline)
I conquer claustrophobia
(crystalline)
And demand the light
It's the sparkle you become
Conquer the anxiety
It's the sparkle you become
Conquer the anxiety
