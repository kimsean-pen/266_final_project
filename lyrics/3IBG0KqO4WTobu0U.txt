Sunlight falling down above us
We belong to all that we asked for
You do talk about the signs with passion
Your soul I discovered at this shore

Stick with me forget the sorrow
And maybe tomorrow we'll shorten the distance
Get on the train to embrace this chance

Your soft hands covering my ears
City sounds growing my fears

Stick with me erase the sorrow
And maybe tomorrow we'll embrace this chance
Get on the train to shorten the distance, the distance
We'll shorten the distance
Distance, the distance

Distance
