Would your bare your neck
To the walking dead
Secretly, at least
Within the safety of your head?
Tell me, isn't it nice
Every once in a while
Being the centre of attention
Of a loving, parasite
Would your bare your neck
To the walking dead
Secretly, at least
Within the safety of your head?
Tell me, isn't it nice
Every once in a while
Being the centre of attention
Of a loving, handsome, parasite
Answering your call
The invitation of the scar
For being wanted, accepted
For the way you feel you are?
