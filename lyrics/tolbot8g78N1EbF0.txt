Watch out...
Something's not right...
Something's here through the day...
And still here at night...
And it doesn't matter if you go outside or stay inside your room
It's always there...
Always everywhere...

You hear singin'
Ah...

Don't move...
There's somebody else in the room...
I see flashes of gold and silver and black...
Lit by a silvery moon...
And it doesn't matter if you're rich or poor, you've seen it all before...
It's always there...
Always everywhere...

You hear singin'
Ah
Singin'
Ah

All the memories we've lost
To the times when you pay the cost
Will we all be better now
If we keep on singing loud?

Ah
Singin'
Ah
Singin'
Ah
Singin'
