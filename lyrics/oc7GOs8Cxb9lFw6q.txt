My love
It's so hard
my love
is going so surprised

your love
it's so fine
your love
why is it gotta be so hard?

Our love
Is not your fault
Dissapear
Is what I want yes it is
Our love
Why's it gotta be so hard?
Our love
Always leaving me in the dark

My love
Left me with a broken heart
Our love
My love

Your lost
And I'm alone
Tell me you hear
But you move on

So shine on
Shine on
I let you go
And I wonder you'll know

Our love
Why's it gotta be so hard
Our love
Always leaving me in the dark
My love
Left me with a broken heart
Our love
My love

Our love
Why's it gotta be so hard
Our love
Always leaving me in the dark
My love
Left me with a broken heart
Our love
My love
