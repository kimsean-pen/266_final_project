Come, I'll tear you apart
Pump some blood in your heart
Let me love who you are
Be the moon to your star

I'm the ghost of your past
I'm not your first, but your last
You're the pearl, I'm the glass
And I've been wanting to ask

'Coz a million songs've been written about this
It's an ancient old cliché
Oh, when are you gonna love me?
La, la, la, la. La, la, la, la. La, la, la, la
When are you gonna? La, la, la, la
When are you gonna love me?

Come, I'll sing you a song (come, I'll sing you a song)
'Bout how I felt all along (baby)
Let me tell you the truth
I've been waiting for you

You're the ghost of my past
You're not my first, but my last
(I tell you) You're the goat, I'm the grass
And now I'm gonna ask

'Coz a million songs've been written about this
It's an ancient old cliché
Oh, when are you gonna love me?
La, la, la, la. La, la, la, la. La, la, la, la
When are you gonna? La, la, la, la
When are you gonna love me?

Baby you are the pearl and I am the glass
You are the goat and I am the grass
You're the skies and I am the grass
I've been waiting

'Coz a million songs've been written about this
It's an ancient old cliché
Oh, when are you gonna love me?
La, la, la, la. La, la, la, la. La, la, la, la
When are you gonna? La, la, la, la
When are you gonna love me?
