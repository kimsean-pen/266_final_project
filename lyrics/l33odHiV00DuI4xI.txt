Stay
With me for a while
What's gonna happen
As I am laying in your arms
And
Before the goodbye
I wanna try it
Run out the clock
But it still alarms
Just gimme gimme angel kiss
Cuz you the only one I miss
Just gimme gimme angel kiss
Cuz you the only one I miss
Just gimme gimme
Love
That makes me feel so weak
My body's saying
You are the right one
But I'm blind
Eyes
The only way to speak
It's not complicated
Cuz we can read each other minds
Just gimme gimme angel kiss
Cuz you the only one I miss
Just gimme gimme angel kiss
Cuz you the only one I miss
Just gimme gimme angel kiss
Just gimme gimme angel kiss
Cuz you the only one I miss
Just gimme gimme angel kiss
Cuz you the only one I miss
Just gimme gimme angel kiss
Just gimme gimme angel kiss
Just gimme gimme angel kiss
