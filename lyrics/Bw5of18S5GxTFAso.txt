I found someone,
That looks just like you
I found a girl,
I think I like her too

Tonight's the night
Lets go for a ride
I wanna drown in your California eyes

I'm driving fast
I need to slow down
I've seen this road
That go I'm like No
I don't care
I'll dance on my own
We are young but we are halfway home

I'm in the mood
Tell me what you wanna do
We let it snow
And drive a mountain view
Like Super-Heroes
We catch the stars and moon

We got this one last night
With our hands up high
Make me feel alive
When my mind's a slave for you
(Not looking for love, just looking for you-uh)
I got this one last one night
I got nothing to hide
Baby, don't be shy
'Cause my Kiss won't lie to you
(Not looking for love, I'm looking for you-uh)

I wear sunglasses
All through the night
Our skin is glowing
From the red traffic light
And if you feel me
That our bodies colide
I wanna dive in your California High

I'm in the mood
Tell me what you wanna do
We let it snow
And drive a mountain view
Like Super-Heroes
We catch the stars and moon

We got this one last night
With our hands up high
Make me feel alive
When my mind's a slave for you
(Not looking for love, just looking for you-uh)
I got this one last one night
I got nothing to hide
Baby, don't be shy
'Cause my Kiss won't lie to you
(Not looking for love, I'm looking for you-uh)

Hey!
Get me High
Hey!
Get me High
Hey! (I got this one last time)
Get me High (I got nothing to hide)
Hey! (Baby don't be shy)
Get me High
Because my kiss won't lie to you!
