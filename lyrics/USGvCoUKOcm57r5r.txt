The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his newfound friends

He said, I been where I liked
I slept with who I liked
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice

But now I don't know why
I feel so tongue-tied

I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving, cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis

It got edited fucked up
Strangled, beaten up
Used as a photo in Time Magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon

I
Don't
Know

Why I
Feel
So
Tongue-tied

Don't
Know
Why
I feel

So
Skinned alive

My thoughts are misguided and a little naive
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis
Yeah, no one likes a smart-ass but we all like stars
That wasn't my intention, I did it for a reason
It must have got mixed up, strangled, beaten up
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis and

I
Don't
Know
Why I
Feel
So
Tongue-tied
