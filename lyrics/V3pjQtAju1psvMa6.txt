Strange infatuation seems to grace the evening tide
I'll take it by your side
Such imagination seems to help the feeling slide
I'll take it by your side
Instant correlation sucks and breeds a pack of lies
I'll take it by your side
Oversaturation curls the skin and tans the hide
I'll take it by your side

I'm unclean, a libertine
And every time you vent your spleen
I seem to lose the power of speech
Your slipping slowly from my reach
You grow me like an evergreen
You never see the lonely me at all

I...
Take the plan, spin it sideways
I...
Fall
Without you, I'm nothing
Without you, I'm nothing
Without you, I'm nothing
Take the plan, spin it sideways
Without you, I'm nothing at all
