Stay without me

A tired heart that barely works
Still moving at the speed of light
Blood still runs, blowing through places
That make the body ache
Calloused hands can't let go
Hold on for another day
Stay without me, I have no one
Wandering in the grey

Who will hold the people that cannot be held?
Who will walk the crime scene and collect all the remains?
Who will find the pieces and put them in a box?
Who will sing to anyone, with no place in the world?
