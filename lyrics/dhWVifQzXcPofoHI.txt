Someone else can make you happy.
Someone else can show you a good time...
A good time...
Someone else can say "I'm Sorry"...
Someone else can fire, until you realize...
'Till you realize...
But not like i do...
Not like me.
Someone else can make you happy...
Someone else can give you all you need.
When you need.
Someone else can say "I'm Sorry"...
Someone else can fire, until you bleed...
'Til you bleed...
But not like i do...
Not like me.
(Instrumental)
Into the closet, say goodbye.
Take your clothes, hating, but your mind.
You'll sleep tonight.
Knowing tonight...
It hurts your eyes...
Knowing tonight...
