You know I'm here
Waiting for you.
I know you like me,
This moment here
Is slipping away.

Just say what you want,
Take what you need,
Everything is yours,
Only if you want it.
Reach out for love
Don't be afraid,
Don't, don't be afraid
Trust me when I say that

Time won't wait for us,
I just want your kiss,
I don't wanna miss this moment.
Time won't wait for us,
Open up your heart,
Say that we won't miss this moment.

Time won't stay still.
Only know what's between us.
I just wanna love you,
Don't know if I will.
