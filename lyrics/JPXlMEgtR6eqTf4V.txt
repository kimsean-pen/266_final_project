I didn't notice anything strange
About the picture in your picture frame
It was drawn of a fountain in your body
Bought for a fiver it was probably
Didn't mean a lot to me
Lot to me

You tell me that you'd never sell this
That the artist himself was beneath this
That life itself is within this
And I looked at the sky to worship the ground

And you never asked for nothing at all
Even after it clawed at your door
And you do your best to fold me
And unfold me again

Time will make fools of us all
It's time to find meaning or control
Every time we go out now you pretends
Pretends we're not lovers just friends
And it gets to me
gets to me

Tell me the meaning of life is
To be happy and to give up love
But you've never lost something you loved
I turn around how could I be angry at you?

And you never asked for nothing at all
Even after it clawed at your door
And you do your best to fold me
And unfold me again
And unfold me again

And it gets to me
Gets to me
Tell me the meaning of life is
To be happy and to give up love
But you've never lost something you loved
I turn around how could I be angry at you?

And you never asked for nothing at all
Even after it clawed at your door
And you do your best to fold me
And unfold me again
And unfold me again
And you never asked for nothing at all
