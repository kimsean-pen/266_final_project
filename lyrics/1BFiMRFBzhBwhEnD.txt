Each and every day
Hiding from the sunshine
Wandering in the shade
Not too old, not too young

Every night again
Dancing with the moonlight
Somewhere far away
I can hear your call

(I'm) Out of my head
Of my heart and my mind
'Cause you can run but you can't hide
I'm gonna make you mine

Out of my head
Of my heart and my mind
'Cause I can feel how your flesh now is crying out for more

Ain't no fairytale
What I see in your eyes
Awaiting your mistake
Not too close, not too far

Sneaking in the pain
Every truth becomes lie
I won't trust myself
Once I hear your call

I'm out of my head
Of my heart and my mind
'Cause you can run but you can't hide
I'm gonna make you mine

Out of my head
Of my heart and my mind
'Cause I can feel how your flesh now is crying out for more

I'm out of my head
Of my heart and my mind
Out of my head
Of my heart and my mind

(I'm) Out of my head
Of my heart and my mind
'Cause you can run but you can't hide
I'm gonna make you mine

Out of my head
Of my heart and my mind
'Cause I can feel how your flesh now is crying out for more
