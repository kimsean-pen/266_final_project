You've got me surrounded
It feels like I'm drowning and I don't want to come up for air
I lost everything, I threw myself in and you took me where no one was there
Well you can take what you need, take the air that I breathe and I'll give away all that I own
Whatever I lose, is put back by you in a way that you'll never know

'Cause I can't be without you

I'll be there when you need me most
I'll be there if you're ever alone
Together, we can grow old
I can't leave you
I can't leave you, no

There's no air around me, when we get this close but there's no where I want to go
You keep it a secret if you feel the same and leave me dying to know

'Cause I can't be without you

I'll be there when you need me most
I'll be there if you're ever alone
Together, we can grow old
I can't leave you
I can't leave you

You're my way out
You're my way through
And I can't, I can't
Be without you
You're my way out
You're my way through
And I can't
Be without you

So be there when I need you most
Be there, whenever I'm alone
Together, will we grow old
I can't leave you
I can't leave you

I'll be there when you need me most
I'll be there if you're ever alone
Together, we can grow old
I can't leave you
I can't leave you, no
