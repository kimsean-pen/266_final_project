Lost all self-control
Don't know where to go
Take a piece of soul
In my mind I take a hold

Confusion
Solution
Conclusion
Resolution
I can feel
I can see
The resolution
I do
I do

Put myself through tests
Move from East to West
Fight for what is best
Can't forgive the token stress

Confusion
Solution
Conclusion
Resolution
I can feel, I can see
The resolution
I do
I do
I can see the resolution
I do
I can see

Strange to lose the show
Take it fast then slow
Captive to myself

I can see

I do
I do
I do
I can see the resolution
I do
