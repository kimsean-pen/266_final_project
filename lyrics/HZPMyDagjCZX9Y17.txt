Looking for my breath
In these dark and stormy days
All I do is miss you
Darling one, in so many ways

Should I not look back
I know hour's getting late
I won't sing of sorrow, but please
Don't take your love away

Somewhere in the mountains
And somewhere in New York
We'll forget the hour
There's that song we hummed before

I heard them talk of sunshine
Life in restful ways
I won't sing of sorrow, but please
Don't take your love away

Some nights will haunt me
Until the daylight comes around
I'll be fine, it's all I really own
It's always been around

Hanging on the dream of you
I will fall through days
But I get up stubborn
All your warmth and funny ways

Should I not look back
I know, hour's getting late
I won't sing of sorrow, but please
Don't take your love away

Some nights will haunt me
Until the daylight comes around
I'll be fine, it's all I really own
It's always been around

I run before the days
Will have me to believe
Your dance within me
It's only but a dream

Somewhere in the mountains
And somewhere in New York
We'll forget the hour
And the long, long road
