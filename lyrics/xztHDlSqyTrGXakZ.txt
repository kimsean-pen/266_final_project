Oh and you won't let me dance with you
And you won't let me dance
You dance the night by
See no sign
You're dancing it right on the fence

Your Friday night gets hard at times
You only come once a year

Well they set you here on the weekend
and dress you up open wide
Well they sent you here on the darkened
and they dressed you up open wide
They ance and standing away from you,
oh you did it up all the time
Surely standing away from you
oh you lit up all the time

I miss you now
I miss you now, right now
Won't you come 'round
We'll work it out somehow

Make a wish
Make it happen
Count to three
Make it happen
all your dreams
all your plans
all your lifetime
Make it now

Well you rock me in my dreams now
while you sounding off all alone
well you set it off in my dreams now
well you set me off all alone

You dance at night
but I can see no signs
you're dancing the night on the fence
Your Friday night gets hard at times
still dancing it right on the fence

Well they set you here on the weekend
and dress you up open wide
Well they sent you here on the darkened
and they dressed you up open wide
They dance and standing away from you,
oh you did it up all the time
Surely standing away from you
oh you lit up all the time

I miss you now
I miss you now right now
Won't you come 'round
We'll work it out somehow

Make a wish
Make it happen
Count to three
Make it happen
all your dreams
all your plans
all your lifetime
make it now

Make a wish
and make it now

I miss you now
I miss you now right now
Won't you come 'round
We'll work it out somehow
