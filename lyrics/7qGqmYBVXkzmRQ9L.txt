I am the moon man
They thought I would make it
But I never made it
Guess I'm just a regular Joe with no home
I need to get recognised
You know the names, I know the lies
Still, I never made it
They don't deserve all this greatness
Do they know my name?
What did he say?
Sorry babe, I will not be home today
Do they know my name?
What did he say?
Sorry babe, I will not be home today
Do they know my name?
What did he say?
Sorry babe, I will not be home today
Do they know my name?
What did he say?
Sorry babe, I will not be home today
I am the moon man
I am the moon man
I am the moon man
My mother's the greatest
She's always my saviour
One day I'll return the favour
But I lost my love now
I need to preach what I've lost now
Am I that hard to forgive?
Do those who love deserve to live?
Do they know my name?
What did he say?
Sorry babe, I will not be home today
Do they know my name?
What did he say?
Sorry babe, I will not be home today
Do they know my name?
What did he say?
Sorry babe, I will not be home today
Do they know my name?
What did he say?
Sorry babe, I will not be home today
I am the moon man
I am the moon man
I am the moon man
I am the moon man
