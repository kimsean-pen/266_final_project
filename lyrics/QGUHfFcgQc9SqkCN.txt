Killing inside
I am corrosion - Killing inside
Killing inside
I am destruction - Killing inside

Killing inside
I'm burning fear - Killing inside
Killing inside
I am the killer - Everyone dies

Look in my eyes
They come to murder, murder now
Everyone dies
Inflicting pain to all

Look in my eyes
The worms are rising out
Everyone dies
They kill from inside out

Killing inside
I am terminal - Killing inside
Killing inside
I am fatal - Killing inside

Killing inside
I am immortal - Killing inside
Killing inside
I am forever - Look in my eyes

Look in my eyes
They come to murder, murder now
Everyone dies
Inflicting pain to all

Look in my eyes
The worms are rising out
Everyone dies
They kill from inside out

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I feel no fear
What I fear is what is killing inside
And I know that the end is near

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I feel no fear
What I fear is what is killing inside
I know that the end is near

Everyone dies...

Look in my eyes
They come to murder, murder now
Everyone dies
Inflicting pain to all

Look in my eyes
The worms are rising out
Everyone dies
They kill from inside out
