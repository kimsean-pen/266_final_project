Now here comes counter-action for satisfaction
Ya, Someone come fe rock the nation
Give you like a medicine injection, you know?
Do it Jah
Ca' Natty sat upon the rock and watch the wicked dem drop
Sat upon the rock and watch the wicked dem drop
Then he launch an attack and dem a two boy drop
He launch and attack and dem a two boy drop

Natty trod into the jungles of Africa
Cho, Natty trod into the jungles of Africa
He open the Bible so he read of a chapter
Started to chant up the roots and culture
Tell it to the brothers and he tell it to the sister

He sat upon the rock and watch the wicked dem drop
He sat upon the rock and watch the wicked dem drop
Man you coulda never hide from Jah
Cho man I said you coulda never hide from Jah

Come on I say you get away from man but you no get away from Jah
you get away from man but you no get away from Jah
Say you coulda never hide from Jah
Come on you say you coulda never hide from Jah

Come on now Natty tread up on the mountain top
I tell you Natty tread up on the mountain top
Come on now mek we chant down Babylon
Come on now mek we chant down Babylon
Down to the ground
Say on your way up, on your way down
You rigging and jigging to the number one sound
Mek we chant down Babylon down to the ground
We chant down Babylon down to the ground

No matter where you run you just can't hide
You slip you slide you gwan broke your backside
Natty sat upon the rock and watch the wicked dem drop
Natty sat upon the rock and watch the wicked dem drop
Natty charge and attack and dem a two boy drop

You come up with your hammer you come up with your saw
You come up with your hammer you come up with your saw
You build a lickle house in a Africa
When you build a lickle house in a Africa

In a Babylon a pure man slaughter
I say inna Babylon a pure man slaughter
Me can't get no fun, neither laughter
Me can't get no fun, neither laughter

He sat up with African daughter
Ca' Natty sat up with the African daughter
Natty sat upon the rock and watch the wicked dem drop
Sat upon the rock and watch the wicked dem drop
Sat upon the rock and watch the wicked dem drop
Then he charge and attack and dem a two boy drop
You coulda never hide from Jah
You coulda never hide from Jah

I say you can't go to Zion with a carnal mind
You can't go to Zion with a carnal mind
Seh dem with dirty mind you have to leave them behind
You can't go to Zion with your M16
Your hands and your heart have to be pure and clean
Clear off with the guns and the magazine?
I tell you I beg you pass me the ital green
Come on now natty chant up the roots and culture
Come and get it to the brothers and sister
Ca' Natty sat upon the rock and watch the wicked dem drop
Sat upon the rock and watch the wicked dem drop
