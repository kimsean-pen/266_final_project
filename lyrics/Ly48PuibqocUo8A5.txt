Nothing left for me to say
There's no more wicked games to play
It's time for me to walk away
I am allright

I feel like I'm on a high
A new beginning that is my life
I'm turning to the rythm of the night
I am allright

The music is making me grow and
The only thing that keeps me awake is me knowing
There's noone here to break me or bring me down
And noone here to hurt me or fool around

I have no more time for you to hurt my feelings
Done enough to prove I'm all that I believe in
We are at the end no more stupid lies
I'm better off without you here by my side

So no there is no longer you and I - you and I
You and I - you and I
You and I - you and I
You and I
There is no longer you and I - you and I
You and I - you and I
You and I - you and I
You and I

Don't care what other people say
I know you fool around all day
Now it doesn't hurt me anyway
I am allright

And when the day turns into night
I'm in a club forgetting you and I
And when I'm think of how you treated me
You proved me right

The music is making me growing
The only thing that keeps me awake is me knowing
There's noone here to break me or bring me down
And noone here to hurt me or fool around.

I have no more time for you to hurt my feelings
Done enough to prove I'm all that I believe in
We are at the end no more stupid lies
I'm better off without you here by my side

So no there is no longer you and I - you and I
You and I - you and I
You and I - you and I
You and I
There is no longer you and I - you and I
You and I - you and I
You and I - you and I
You and I
