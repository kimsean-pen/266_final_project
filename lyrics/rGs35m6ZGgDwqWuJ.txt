It's a series of bars, thrift stores, & churches
Lining the streets
While women with gold crosses push kids
Into half-formed beliefs
If Lot was righteous
I think I'd rather not be
We lean on fences built from
Out-dated morality
It's a gang mentality
It's a dangerous thing

They don't ask you to think, just to
Repeat after me
& assume you're too careless

To look at it critically

You'll stop progress if it contradicts what
You're told to believe
I refuse to spend life on my knees
These billboards that flaunt
These scare tactics
Make me think you're only good if
You're afraid of being punished
Every single Sunday
Church bells wake me up
But it's never enough
To pull me out of bed
The church on Main Street
Has got its doors painted red
& I guess
It's so the Angel of Death passes over it
On its way to get gas
The church on Broad Street
Has got a neon sign that says "Jesus Save Me"
& I guess it's so God can see from where He is
In the cheap seats
I refuse to spend life on my knees
& I won't let
Somebody else
Somebody else
Somebody else make my decisions for me
If we're all
Just Christians
Or lions
Then I think I'd rather be
On the side with sharper teeth
I don't need saving
