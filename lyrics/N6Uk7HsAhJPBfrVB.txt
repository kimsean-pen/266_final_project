Come out of the shadow
Step into the light
This could be the moment
Are you ready to fight?

Don't you know, you know?
You're not the only one
Why so low, so low?
What are you waiting for?

All I ever hear are whispers
All they ever hear are whisper
But I just wanna

Hear your voice, don't be afraid
Why don't you scream a little louder?
Turn it up, I know you can
Come on and scream a little louder

Oh, oh oh, oh oh
Why don't you scream a little louder?
Oh, oh oh, oh oh
Why don't you scream a little louder?

Wanna be remembered?
Stand out of the crowd
Don't choke on the fire
It's tryna burn you out

Why so low, so low?
What are you waiting for?

All I ever hear are whispers
All they ever hear are whisper
But I just wanna

Hear your voice, don't be afraid
Why don't you scream a little louder?
Turn it up, I know you can
Come on and scream a little louder

Oh, oh oh, oh oh
Why don't you scream a little louder?
Oh, oh oh, oh oh
Why don't you scream a little louder?

Come out of the shadow
Step into the light
This could be the moment
It could change your life

All I ever hear, a whisper's
But I just wanna

Hear your voice, don't be afraid
Why don't you scream a little louder?
Turn it up, I know you can
Come on and scream a little louder

Oh, oh oh, oh oh
Why don't you scream a little louder?
Oh, turn it up, I know you can
Why don't you scream a little louder?
Oh oh, oh oh
Why don't you scream a little louder?
