Virus, virus, virus...

Virus!

When every hour could be the last
Why would we wait?
Why would we wait?

And every road could be unsafe
But we'll be okay
We'll make it, we'll make it

It's just who we are
Say where to go
And I know that I won't slow down
It's just who we are
Yeah, we will do anything we dream about

How about now?
How about now?
How about now?
How about now?

Virus!

How about now?
How about now?
How about now?
How about now?
