When the world is breaking down around you taking everything that you know

What you didn't know
Is that we can go forever

If we want to we can live inside of a moment

The one that we own

You and me we got this
You and me we're beautiful, beautiful

We are, we are, we're gonna be alright
We got, we got, we always got the fight in us

And we are, we are, we're gonna live tonight

Like there's no tomorrow cause we're the afterlife

Living like you're dying isn't living at all
Gimme your cold hands

Put 'em on my heart
Raise a glass to everyone who thinks they'll never make it through this life
To live a brand new start

You and me we got this
You and me we're beautiful, beautiful

We are, we are, we're gonna be alright
We got, we got, we always got the fight in us
And we are, we are, we're gonna live tonight
Like there's no tomorrow cause we're the afterlife

Cause we're the afterlife
Cause we're the afterlife

Every time I close my eyes I hear your favorite song telling me not to run
not to worry anymore
I can't hold on tight to nothing better than the rest
so is now or nevermore

We are, we are gonna be alright
We got the fight in us
We are, we are, we're gonna live tonight
Like there's no tomorrow cause we're the afterlife

We are, we are, we're gonna be alright
We got, we got, we always got the fight in us
And we are, we are, we're gonna live tonight
Like there's no tomorrow cause we're the afterlife
Cause we're the afterlife
Cause we're the afterlife
We are, we are, we're gonna be alright
We got, we got, we always got the fight in us
And we are, we are, we're gonna live tonight
Like there's no tomorrow cause we're the afterlife.
