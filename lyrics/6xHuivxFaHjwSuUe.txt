Saturday night, ate our lives completely.
The future looked bad, it was all we had.
Saturday came and we lost our minds completely.
Ready or not, 'cause it's all we've got.
Something had to change now.
Pressure find it's way out.
Saturday stretched to an endless line
the morning as far as the end of time
and if we don't lose our heads
then we'll all be fine.
Saturday night was our promised land
and Saturday all that we ever had
and we reached for ourselves
when we raised our hands.
Saturday night, you know where to find me.
Miles away from the long dull day.
Lost in a dream
and the world seems far behind me.
I'm somebody else.
I escaped myself.
Something has to change now.
Pressure find it's way out.
For now...
let me lose myself for a while.
Let me lose myself.
Saturday stretched to an endless line
the morning as far as the end of time
and if we don't lose out heads
then we'll all be fine.
Saturday night was our promised land
and Saturday all that we ever had
and we reached for ourselves
when we raised our hands.
