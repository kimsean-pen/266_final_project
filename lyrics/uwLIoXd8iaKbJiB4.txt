Though it's over now
And I cope somehow
And the cold winds blow
I hear you

What is now a dream
For a while it was real
And I can't conceal
That I miss you

But our love
Was like catching a snowflake
As it reached our hands
It was already gone

Though our case stays closed
I keep chasing ghosts
Every time it snows
I see you

And I feel no cold
As you lend me your coat
Through the pale white glow
I feel you

But our love
Was like catching a snowflake
As it reached our hands
It was already gone

This love
Was not ours to take
It was fated to break
Thought it was beautiful

But I lost you on the way down
Even though I tried so hard
To be with you to hold on to
You with all my broken heart
But I lost you on the way down

But our love
Was like catching a snowflake
As it reached our hands
It was already gone

This love
Was not ours to take
It was fated to break
Thought it was beautiful

Catching a snowflake
Was like catching
It was catching a snowflake
