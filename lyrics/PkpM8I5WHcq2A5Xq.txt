I will never let you leave my sight
I've been staying up lately, all night
Making sure you get to bed safely
Dreaming of when it will be you and me

Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh

You go there and I'll go too
I'll be the one that follows you
Watch you sleep and watch you wake
Notice all the moves you make
(Be your rock, I'll be your guide)
(Without you it's suicide)
Can't wait til the day we meet
(Until then I'll watch you sleep)

Oh (I'm just tying the knot)
Can't wait to catch you all alone
Oh (I'm just tying the knot)
Girl, then I swear I'll take you home
Whether you want it or not
Whether you like it or not

Whether you want it or not
Whether you like it or not

I will never let you leave my sight
I've been staying up lately, all night
Making sure you get to bed safely
Dreaming of when it will be you and me

I've got the sickest picture of you in my mind
I get the strangest urges all of the time inside
Take part in this demonstration, rope mixed with wine
I hope to follow through with you cause the timings right

Stuck inside the living room
Tangled faces, glow in tune
(Commenting is hardly rude)
I can't monitor what I consume

Body count competition
Childhood memory demolition
(Slap your wrist, except the sentence)
Ain't my fault if I'm irrelevant

Oh (I'm just tying the knot)
Can't wait to catch you all alone
Oh (I'm just tying the knot)
Girl, then I swear I'll take you home
Whether you want it or not
Whether you like it or not

Whether you want it or not
Whether you like it or not

I'm always watching you
