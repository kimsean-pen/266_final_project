The bright sun in the blue water
We fight less and love harder
You tell me that I'm the one
I tell you it's just for fun

We walk the beach at midnight
And watch the stars in the clear skies
We both say I love you
But it's alright

The bright sun in the blue water
We fight less and love harder
You tell me that I'm the one
I tell you it's just for fun

We walk the beach at midnight
And watch the stars in the clear skies
We both say I love you
But it's alright
