Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na

He takes your hand, I die a little
I watch your eyes, and I'm in riddles
Why can't you look at me like that?

When you walk by, I try to say it
But then I freeze and never do it
My tongue gets tied, the words get trapped

I hear the beat of my heart getting louder whenever I'm near you

But I see you with him, slow dancing
Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him, I'm breaking
Oh, how I wish that was me

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na

He looks at you the way that I would
Does all the things I know that I could
If only time could just turn back

'Cause I got three little words that I've always been dying to tell you

But I see you with him, slow dancing
Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him, I'm breaking
Oh, how I wish that was me

With my hands on your waist while we dance in the moonlight
I wish it was me that you'll call later on 'cause you wanna say goodnight

('Cause I see you with him, slow dancing)
(Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see)

But I see you with him, slow dancing
Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him, I'm breaking
Oh, how I wish–
Oh, how I wish–
Oh, how I wish that was me
Oh, how I wish that was me
