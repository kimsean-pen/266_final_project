In a world
Where we think
That we've seen
Everything

In a world
Where we think
That we rise above
All things

In a time
That is so fast
You have to run
So you won't get lost

In a time
That is so loud
You have to scream
To get recognised

In a land
Where you must fight
For a little Fragement
Of human right

In a system
That uses war
To spread its spirit
Around the globe

A religion
That uses hate
To plug its message
Into your brain

A revolution
That turns back time
Forgets what we have
Learned to be

I'd like to say
I have to say

You... don't know nothin'
You... don't know nothin' about
You... don't know nothin'
You... don't know nothin' at all!

A public
Where shoes do shine
And money beats
Respect for life

In a world
That is cleaned
Of all secrets
That nature kept

A public
Where death's reduced
To be excitement
In late night news

In a time
Where children learn
To ignore the world
Around them

I'd like to say
I have to say

You... don't know nothin'
You... don't know nothin' about
You... don't know nothin'
You... don't know nothin' at all!

I'd like to say
I have to say

You... don't know nothin'
You... don't know nothin' about
You... don't know nothin'
You... don't know nothin' at all!
