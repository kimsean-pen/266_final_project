I've a little red rooster
Too lazy to crow 'fore day

I have a little red rooster
Too lazy to crow 'fore day

Keep everything in the barnyard
Upset in every way

Oh the dogs begin to bark and the
Hound begin to howl

Oh, the dogs begin to bark
Hound begin to howl

Oh watch out strange kin people 'cause the
Little red rooster on the prowl

If you see my little red rooster
Please drag him home

Yeah if you see my little red rooster
Please drag him home

There been no peace in the barnyard
Since the little red rooster been gone
