It don't matter to me
If you really feel that
You need sometime to be free
Time to go out searching for yourself
Hoping to find
Time to go to find

It don't matter to me
If you take up with some
One who's better than me
'Cause your happiness is all I want
For you to find
Peace, your peace of mind

Lotta people have an ego hang-up
'Cause they want to be the only one
How many came before it really doesn't matter
Just as long as you're the last
Everybody moving on and try to find out
What's been missing in the past

And it don't matter to me
If your searching brings you
Back together with me
'Cause there'll always be
An empty room waiting for you
An open heart waiting for you
Time is on my side
'Cause it don't matter to me

It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me

'Cause there'll always be
An empty room waiting for you
An open heart waiting for you
Time is on my side
'Cause it don't matter to me
