Lonely consolations from a tv screen
and further things unseen
Pixeled consolations don't know what they bring
but it's not empathy

Dream from palpitations your ideas fade
they begin to stray
But you can always make it up along the way
from what you're meant to say

(?) exitation from the cluttered sounds
where the voices drown
Morbid fascination in (?)
it becomes unwound

If only this were real you'd see it clear as day
and not some other way
Terrible (?) oozing through the ground
you were never found

Take me from these arcade blues
i don't know what to do, i don't know what to do
Take these hands, let them loose
something else to do, find something else to do
