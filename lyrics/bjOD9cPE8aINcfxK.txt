Pressure, pressure calls my name
I think it's time that I should
Push it back and entertain it
I measure, measure in my brain
All of the times that I've been
Too afraid, it's time to change it

Time is the key but the devil just keeps on knocking
I don't want to stand at the doorway of the forgotten, oh, oh oh
Fear wears a smile but I'll be the last one laughing
Try to take me down, no it ain't ever gonna happen, no, oh oh

No, not today
Not gonna make the same mistakes
No, not today
Not gonna cave, not gonna break

Under the pressure
Under the pressure
Never gonna break
No matter what it takes

Under the pressure
Under the pressure
I never gonna break
No matter what it takes

Pressure, pressure calls my name
I think it's time that I should
Push it back and entertain it
Forever, ever like a game
Stacked up the cards against me
But now I think my luck is changing

Time is the key but the devil just keeps on knocking
I don't want to stand at the doorway of the forgotten, oh, oh oh
Fear wears a smile but I'll be the last one laughing
Try to take me down, no it ain't ever gonna happen, no, oh oh

Under the pressure
Under the pressure
I never gonna break
No matter what it takes

Under the pressure
Under the pressure
I never gonna break
No matter what it takes

No, not today
Not gonna make the same mistakes
No, not today
Not gonna cave, not gonna break

No, not today
Not gonna make the same mistakes
No, not today
Not gonna cave, not gonna break

Under the pressure
Under the pressure
I never gonna break
No matter what it takes

Under the pressure
Under the pressure
I never gonna break
No matter what it takes

I never gonna break
No matter what it takes

I never gonna break
No matter what it takes
