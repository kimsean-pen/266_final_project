On a quiet afternoon
Staring out of your room

Feeling blue
What am I gonna do?
Look at me, just close your eyes
Try to realize
Look at me, just close your eyes
Try to realize

Coffee's there
On the floor
From the night before
Shades are drawn
Against the sun
Where is everyone?

Look at me, just close your eyes
Try to realize
Look at me, just close your eyes
Try to realize
