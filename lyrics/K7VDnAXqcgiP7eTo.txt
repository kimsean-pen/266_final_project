Confusion in her eyes that says it all
She's lost control
And she's clinging to the nearest passer by
She's lost control
And she gave away the secrets of her past
And said, "I've lost control again"
And a voice that told her when and where to act
She said, "I've lost control again"
And she turned around and me and took me by the hand
And said, "I've lost control again"
How I'll never know just why or understand
She said, "I've lost control again"
And she screamed out kicking on her side
And said, "I've lost control again"
And seized up on the floor I thought she'd die
She said, "I've lost control "
She's lost control again
She's lost control
She's lost control again
She's lost control
And I had to phone her friend to state my case
And say, "She's lost control again"
And she showed up all the errors and mistakes
And said, "I've lost control again"
And she expressed herself in many different ways
Until she lost control again
And walked upon the edge of no escape
And laughed, "I've lost control"
She's lost control again
She's lost control
She's lost control again
She's lost control.
