Just one step
A different day
Would I know you at all?
Would I know you at all?
When your kingdom falls
And you family fade
But it wasn't your fault
It was never your fault

And I realise
You have to feel alive
And all your worries will escape through the door
And you'll wake up all alone on the floor
It's not too late
Just rely on me now

Nine months on
And people fade
I wouldn't be here at all
I wouldn't be here at all
'Cause I fell in line
At a different place
And it wasn't my fault
No it was never my fault

And I realise
You have to feel alive
Inside
And all your worries will escape through the door
And you'll wake up all alone on the floor
It's not too late
Just rely on me now

And all your worries will escape through the door
And you'll wake up all alone on the floor
It's not too late
Just rely on me now

And all your worries will escape through the door
And you'll wake up all alone on the floor
It's not too late
Just rely on me now
