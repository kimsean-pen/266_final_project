Now I'm a demon running wild
All minds are upon me
So come out and reveal your deepest fear
When your heart gives in too soon
To Gods
Gods.

Now I'm collecting your souls tonight
A million fires before your harvest comes
To burn out
Wear the mask of a heathen
For the moon's lonely eyes
They see
They see
The Gods
Gods
Gods
Gods.

To Gods
Gods
Gods
Gods.
