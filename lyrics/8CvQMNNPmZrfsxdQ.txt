So don't take me (take me) home again
I'd rather be standing on my own two feet

Trying not to push anything away
There's only so much I can take (My fist lets the wall take the blame)
I'm not sad. I'm not numb. I'm not anything at all.
But I definitely feel a change
All the smoke in my eyes feels good enough to stay blind
And lately I've been wondering why

You're not the only one, no you're not alone
I can't stress this enough, but just to let you know
It's all about the way that you picked up the phone
I might as well have spilled my guts to a dial-tone

So don't take me (take me) home again
I'd rather be standing on my own two feet

Give me back my light
Without it, it's hard to see at night (my eyes will adjust with time)
I can still feel your touch
I just miss you so much
Your work won't be left undone

You're not the only one, no you're not alone
I can't stress this enough, but just to let you know
It's all about the way that you picked up the phone
I might as well have spilled my guts to a dial-tone

So don't take me (take me) home again
I'd rather be standing on my own two feet
Letting the air out of this bad situation
Painting my walls blank, it's time to start again
