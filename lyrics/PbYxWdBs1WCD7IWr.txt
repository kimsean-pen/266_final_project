It wasn't just the words that were thrown around,
It was the sound when the hit the ground runnin'.

I remember the smell in the room,
It was a bad tatto like cheap perfume.

The days turned to weeks, months into a year,
I gotta bring up all the things that I want her to hear.

Losing sight of reality while losing the fight to try to forget,
All I have are the memories of every single word you said.
Every single word you said.

I remember that day,
Everything changed.
I remember that day,
That image never fades away.
I remember that day,
Something died inside of me.
I remember that day,
That everything changed.

It wasn't just a senseless situation,
Making something out of nothing now.

Are you forgetting that rumors and reputation
Don't help your situation.

If memory serves me right,
You were serving up nothing but a plate of lies.

Losing sight of reality while losing the fight to try to forget,
All I have are the memories of every single word you said.
Every single word you said.
