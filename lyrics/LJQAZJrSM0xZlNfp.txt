The echo of your goodbye lingers like a shadow
How can I make you stay a little longer?
Stay a little longer
Stay a little longer
Blinded by the look in your eyes
If the world's on fire, I still won't mind
Romantic stagnancy was softly killing me
It's fine for me if it's fine for you
Stick around and we'll see this through
Moonlit misery sounded great to me
But as the ocean ebbs and flows
Your love, it comes and goes
The echo of your goodbye, it lingers like a shadow
And how can I make you stay a little longer?
Stay a little longer
Stay a little longer
You are just a heaven, deaf to what I say
Hell will surely listen but it never feels the same
You are just a heathen, blind to what I see
This spontaneity makes me wanna leave
But as the ocean ebbs and flows
Your love, it comes and goes
The echo of your goodbye, it lingers like a shadow
And how can I make you stay a little longer?
Stay a little longer
Stay a little longer
Moonless midnight
I'll drown inside your dark deluge for my whole life
Pitch black sunshine
You waste up all my daylight, and I'm so tired
The echo of your goodbye, it lingers like a shadow
And how can I make you stay a little longer?
Stay a little longer
Lingers like a shadow
