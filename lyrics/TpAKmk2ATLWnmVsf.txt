Don't say I know what you're thinking
It's plain to see
I see my opportunities shrinking
In front of me
I know you've made up your mind
But don't say
Although I know of no crime
It's the same
Guilty
Guilty you've found me
Guilty
Guilty you've found me
Guilty
Guilty you've found me
Guilty
Guilty you've found me
I wonder why you haven't the time for
The reasons why
To hear the truth might alter your mind or
Open your eyes
I know you've made up your mind
But don't say
Although I know of no crime
It's the same
Guilty
Guilty you've found me
Guilty
Guilty you've found me
Guilty
Guilty you've found me
Guilty
Guilty you've found me
I know you've made up your mind
But don't say
Although I know of no crime
It's the same
Guilty
Guilty you've found me
Guilty
Guilty you've found me
Guilty
Guilty you've found me
Guilty
Guilty you've found me
