Dear Claire she gets up at three
She makes some toast and a cup of tea
But she forgot and watched TV
As the water all boiled down
The place almost burned down

Dear Claire she was a pioneer
Her sister said she flew in WWII
She stares out the kitchen door
She says it looks like rain
I'm sure it's gonna rain

The secret life of Claire
I wish I had the key
The treasures buried there
In the secret life of Claire

Dear Claire
I go and help her once a week
She tells me stories and I ask her what she needs
She told me back in '44 she slept with Eleanor
Sometimes she gets confused
For all we know it's true

The secret life of Claire
I wish I had the key
The treasures buried there
In the secret life of Claire

Dear Claire
She wonders why the leaves have turned
And why the summer's been so short this year
And Claire she asks for my name
Have you been here before?
Are you someone I should know?
Then perhaps you'd better go

The secret life of Claire
I wish I had the key
The treasures she could share
In the secret life of Claire
I wish that I'd been there

The secret life of Claire
Oh how I wish I knew
And I bet she wishes too
In the secret life of Claire
