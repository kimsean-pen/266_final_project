Choose me
Choose me

I doubt I was the only one
Hearts broken on my back with the light on
I doubt I was the only one
Hearts broken on my back with the light on

When the wind blows, just know time is running
Just know, I know, time
When the wind blows, just know time is running
Just know, I know, time

Chosee me
Choose me

Choose me
Choose me

When the wind blows, just know
When the wind blows, just know

I doubt I was the only one
Hearts broken on my back with the light on
(Choose me) I doubt I was the only one
(Choose me) I doubt I was the only one
Hearts broken on my back with the light on
