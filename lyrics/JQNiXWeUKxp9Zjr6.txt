I don't want to buy what they're selling these days
Saying feeling and falling is all a mistake, no, no
And why does everybody look at young hearts feeling love
Like it's just a matter of time before they break, no, no

They started saying when you can't hide, run
When you can't run, hide
Started thinking love's a loaded gun
Nobody wants to fight
And when did we all stop thinking that the world stops spinning in a kiss goodnight?
And when did our heartbeat beating too fast stop meaning it was worth the while?
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
And I don't wanna run

I don't wanna hide

Traded out our eyes to light a screen
Traded out holding hands to holding back everything, no, no
No, no, oh
And words got shorter, and quiet got longer

And all of a sudden love started looking like a memory
No, no, no

They started saying if you can't hide, run
If you can't run, hide
Started thinking love's a loaded gun
Nobody wants to fight
And when did we all stop thinking that the world stops spinning in a kiss goodnight?
And when did our heartbeat beating too fast stop meaning it was worth the while?
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved

And I don't wanna run
I don't wanna hide, no
Hmm, no, huuuh...

They started saying when you can't hide, run
When you can't run, hide
But love don't gotta be a loaded gun
Or a losing fight
And when did we all stop thinking that the world stops spinning in a kiss goodnight?
And when did our heartbeat beating too fast stop meaning it was worth the while?
But I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
I wanna, I wanna be loved
And I don't wanna run
I don't wanna hide
And I don't wanna run
I don't wanna hide
And I don't wanna run
I don't wanna hide
