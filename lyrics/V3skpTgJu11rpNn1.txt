feels like i cannot kiss you hard enough
not even if i bore right through you
it's just such physicality is not that much,
past our youth

we're set to be dead men whenever
to leave here tetherless
and at the end of our lives
it's good to be the only thing left

smile for me if you can
i want to have that in my head
smile for me if you can
i want to have that in my head
