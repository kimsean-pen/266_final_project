Feet don't fail me now
Don't fail me now
Don't fail me now
You're all I got

So feet don't fail me now
Don't fail me now
Don't fail me now
You're all I got

You were all my riches
Spent my love till there was nothing left
You were all my sickness
But you cured me of my loneliness

And I lost faith
Nothing left here to say
The ghost of us is fading
And that's what I was chasing

I got faith
Saying it'll be okay
Step by step
I know I'll make it through

So I'm saying all now
Gotta go now
Hold on
Nothing's gonna bring me down

So I gotta reach out
There's a way out
Praying feet don't fail me now
You're all I got

Second chances
Don't call me like they did the first time
All the neighbours
Knew it was done before you and I

And I lost faith
Nothing left here to say
The ghost of those who's fading
And that's what I was chasing

I got faith
Saying it'll be okay
Step by step
I know I'll make it through

So I'm saying all now
Gotta go now
Hold on
Nothing's gonna bring me down

So I gotta reach out
There's a way out
Praying feet don't fail me now

Take what you want, babe
Take what you need, babe
You can have it all
But you can't have me

So I'm saying all now
Gotta go now
Praying feet don't fail me now

Feet don't fail me, don't fail me now (don't fail me)
Feet don't fail me, don't fail me now (don't fail me)
Feet don't fail me, don't fail me now (don't fail me now)
You're all I got

Feet don't fail me now
Feet don't fail me now
Feet don't fail me now
You're all I got
