Looking from a window above,
it's like a story of love
Can you hear me?
Came back only yesterday,
I'm moving farther away
Want you near me

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

Sometimes when I think of her name when it's only a game
And I need you
Listen to the words that you say
it's getting harder to stay
When I see you

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

This is gonna take a long time
and I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more
Wonder if you'll understand,
it's just the touch of your hand
Behind a closed door

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you
