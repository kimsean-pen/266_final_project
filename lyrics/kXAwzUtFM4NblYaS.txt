This is a mean old world, to live in, all by yourself
This is a mean old world, to live in, all by yourself
This is a mean old world to be alone
Without someone to call your own
This is a mean old world, to try and live in, all by yourself

I wish I had someone, someone who'd love me true 2x
If I had someone who loved me true
Then I know I wouldn't be so blue
This is a mean old world to try and live in, all by yourself

No, this is a mean old world to live in, all by yourself
Mean old world, to live in, all by yourself
This is a mean old world to be alone
Without someone to call your own
A mean old world, to try and live in, all by yourself

Sometimes I find myself dreamin I found a love 2x
Sometimes I dream I really found a love
someone who loved me true as the stars above
For this is a mean old world to try and live in, all by yourself
