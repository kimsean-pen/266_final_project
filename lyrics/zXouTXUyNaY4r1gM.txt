Oh Marcello, how I wonder
La Madonna, she tell the truth, no?
She been saying I'll have a baby
When he grow up he become a killer

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Understood

Oh Marcello, never thought I'd
Really love you but I do so
My head waiter's head on your platter
Just say the word and make him kiss my gutters

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Understood, understood

Una mille, una mille, una mille, una mille
Una mille, una mille, una mille, una mille
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good

Oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Understood, understood
Oh Marcello, how I wonder
La Madonna, when she speak she tell the truth, no?

She been saying I'll have a baby
When he grow up he become a killer and kill everybody
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Understood, understood
Oh, Marcello! Oh, Marcello!
