I want to see you down
If I can help to get us
Completed or alike
The tide will never let up
They say it's just a favorite by the sign
That we are strangers from another place
I keep it close to me
That we are going one day to pull ourselves around
Land this is a long round

You've never promise nothing
I always gave you something wrong
We never kept confronting
And all we knew was someone's wrong
You never stopped at bluffing
Too bad you gave me what we asked for moving on
I know you might be staying
When all I wanted was just to know
And if you think we maybe another time, another place
They say it where you'll met me
'Cause this is dangerous for all we thought we planned

The reasons that we hope
Came here to really think through
A change in what we know
Just you wish it brings you
'Cause we know if they say another message
Keeps them leading you on bit by bit
Whatever happens, we'll be searching??
Till they blink to keep me and to hold
Someone to forget to

You've never promise nothing
I always gave you something wrong
We never kept confronting
And all we knew was someone's wrong
You never stopped at bluffing
Too bad you gave me what we asked for moving on
I know you might be staying
When all I wanted was just to know
And if you think we maybe another time, another place
They say it where you'll met me
'Cause this is dangerous for all we thought we planned
