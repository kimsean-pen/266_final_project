Meet farway back whenever
And now we've just been cruising with a ton of clothes
And we'll meet up with whoever
Cuz the truth is we hardly know
Tick in the wind, it's our gift
Put in the chocolate and back to you
Seein' in my eyes, I see it all the time
Give me all the trust, never enough for you
Close in(Now's the time?) time, when you can let your comfort go
And let your worries take control
Don't put us down I can feel my hope is fading
Streets is filling with the tense in you With you we're moving together
And you, the slip in the wait till forever

Come over here and dance with me It's true, we're doomed to never see ...
But winter seemed an endless stream
But I love when we bring stuff together
Come over here and talk to me
It's true, we're doomed to never see)...
But winter seemed an endless stream But I love when we bring stuff back together
