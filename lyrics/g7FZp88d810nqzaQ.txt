I know you've been alone for a while
You hide behind that half-hearted smile

You used to fear a nuanced opinion, now it's so blunt you can finally capture a moment
If it ever existed, whether it be love or hope
If telling the truth is no longer in the group's interest then the individual will no longer see the value in telling it
That's where we're at now and addictions will scream out loud
And you said, "If someone loves you, that doesn't mean they have to save you
But you still expect them to and that's just the truth"

There's a light inside of me
Searching through the light inside of you
There's a light inside of me
Searching through the light inside of you
I love you

Rebellion feels like an addiction, and would we wanna break the rules, we will
'Cause there's a thrill, but if no one teaches us what the rules are
We won't know what to break, so we'll destroy everything
And we'll take it 'til we have nothing
And it's not a way to live, but through this it's all I've learned
You can disagree with someone but you can't let them out of your heart
Or turn, 'cause life is too precious
To hate someone is not cultured, or even meaningful
And you cannot drink poison expecting someone else to die
So let go of all your broken lies
I wish I would learn sooner
The only recourse should be integrity
There's no weapon in hand so you don't have to worry about an enemy
'Cause we will all die, and we will all live forever
We will all die, and we will all live forever
We will all die, and we will all live forever
Whenever you're ready, we'll all live life together

There's a light inside of me
Searching through the light inside of you
There's a light inside of me
Searching through the light inside of you
I love you
