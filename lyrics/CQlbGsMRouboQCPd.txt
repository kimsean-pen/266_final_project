The Universe unfolds:

Out the gate,
Best take me out the game
Think I'd best -
Take two cos I get blue,
Cos I want to...

Alpha male
And I'll fight tooth and nail
For nothing-
I'll slip through,
And affect you
Cos I have to...

Can I get a witness:
Oops I forgot my sickness
Oops you forgot your lipstick luck again...
And who's with us?
We're flies at the reptile party
Oops you forgot your lipstick luck again...

In my leagues of hate
I'll tick me off the page
A shakedown
One word, and you'll slip through
And resent you

And I am the girl
As far as I can tell
And I'm tripping
Too deep
Down my own hole
At the death knoll

Can I get a witness:
Oops I forgot my sickness
Oops you forgot your lipstick luck again...
And who's with us?
We're flies at the reptile party
Oops you forgot your lipstick luck again...

Trust us, we're the thorns in your crown-
Court jesters.
But the lines in the skies infest us.
And the crimes in the rhymes of the U.S
Ask the weapons inspectors.

Out the gate,
I'll take me out the game
Think I could -
Fool you, cos I have to
And I want to...

Go girl, get made
And I'll park the Chevrolet
And we'll spark the black hearts
In the theme park.
Till it gets dark.

Can I get a witness:
Oops I forgot my sickness
Oops you forgot your lipstick luck again...
And who's with us?
We're flies at the reptile party
Oops you forgot your lipstick luck again...

Can I get a witness:
Oops I forgot my sickness
Seems you forgot your lip-synced lark again...
And who's with us?
We're the life of the reptile party
Oops you forgot your lipstick luck again...
