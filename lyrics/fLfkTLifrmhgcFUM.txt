For once I want to be the car crash
Not always just the traffic jam
Hit me hard enough to wake me
And lead me wild to your dark roads

Headlights before me
So beautiful, so clear
Reach out and take it
'Cause I'm so tired of all this fear

My tongue is lost, oh, I can't tell you
Please just see it in my eyes
I pull up thorns from our ripped bodies
And let the blood fall in my mouth

Headlights before me
So beautiful, so clear
Reach out and take it
'Cause I'm so tired of all this fear

Headlights before me
So beautiful, so clear
Reach out and take it
'Cause I'm so tired of all this fear
