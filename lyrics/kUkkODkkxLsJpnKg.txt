I drive a new path so I won't have to pass the place where you first held my hand
And I'm just trying to get back to normal
Not too stiff, too formal
What do I do with my hands?

Now I'm drifting through our regular store
Pretending I'm not wishing you behind every door
And I can't remember what my words were good for
Now I don't get to say I love you anymore

Oh oh
I'm swimming back to shore
Just trying to keep your
Memory from washing over me
And oh, I'm sure I'll find my voice once more
But what are words good for
If I don't get to say I love you anymore

I try not to be distracted by the absence of your coat thrown on my floor
But every part of me can't help but see the places
You should be, the spaces in between our words

Now I'm drifting through our regular store
Pretending I'm not wishing you behind every door
And I can't remember what my words were good for
Now I don't get to say I love you anymore

I'm swimming back to shore
Just trying to keep your
Memory from washing over me
And oh, I'm sure I'll find my voice once more
But what are words good for
If I don't get to say I love you anymore

Rain soaked cobblestones
The streets you walked me home
Your pictures on my phone
(And I don't get to say I love you anymore)

Storm swept in your name and covered me with rain
Now nothing feels the same
Now I don't get to say I love you anymore

I'm swimming back to shore
Just trying to keep your
Memory from washing over me
And oh I'm sure I'll find my voice once more
But what are words good for
If I don't get to say I love you anymore
