Deep down that was your all that I had
Dangling into the bed, I pray I'm there
I can't find the words to break your curse
Something inside the book or it bursts

It's wasn't I, I found the knife
Buried inside the bed, the looks of love

I WANT YOU
I need you, brother
I WANT YOU
I need you, brother

Who would've thought anything gone tonight
Is young and mine
Feeling extreme, I want you to breathe
The rest of your own fire

Diving into the bed, the night is young tonight
Even in space I look for your face
A spark or the light, baby

I WANT YOU
I need you, brother
I WANT YOU
I need you, brother

Coming through, connection with you
It makes my soul aroused
Unspoken like a machine
The force and the fire

Ease through, I found it in you
The animals are there
Shimmering through the evil in you
The dark is in the dark

I WANT YOU
I need you
I WANT YOU
I need

I WANT YOU
I need you, brother
I WANT YOU
I need you, brother
