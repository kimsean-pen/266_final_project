I woke up and saw the sun today
You came by without a warning
You put a smile on my face
I want that for every morning

What is it I'm feeling?
'Cause I can't let it go
If seeing is believing
Then I already know

I'm Falling Fast
I hope this lasts
I'm falling hard
For you
I say, let's
Take a chance
Take it while we can
I know you
Feel it too
I'm Falling Fast
I'm Falling Fast, yeah

Doesn't matter what we do
You make everything seem brighter
I never knew I needed you
Like a sad song needs a sea of lighters

What is it I'm feeling?
'Cause I can't let it go
If seeing is believing
I already know

I'm Falling Fast, God
I hope this lasts 'cause
I'm falling hard for you
I say, let's
Take a chance
Take it while we can 'cause
I know you feel it too
I'm Falling Fast
I'm Falling Fast

I hope you know
I hope it lasts
I'm falling hard
I'm Falling Fast
We can go
No holding back
For you
I hope you know
I hope it lasts
I'm falling hard
I'm Falling Fast
For you
We can go
No holding back

I'm Falling Fast
I hope this lasts
I'm falling hard for you
I say, let's
Take a chance
Take it while we can
I know you feel it too
I'm Falling Fast
I'm Falling Fast
