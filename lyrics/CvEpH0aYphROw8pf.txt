I hope I'm right when I'm speaking my mind
I hope I'm right when I'm speaking my mind
I hope my life is no sign of the times
I hope my life is no sign of the times

I've been looking for the golden trees
I don't wanna see the killing on those leaves
Haven't we all
Haven't we all
Haven't we all
Haven't we all
Maybe I'll just press my hands on it
Haven't we all
Haven't we all
Haven't we all
Haven't we all
Haven't we all
Haven't we all
It's a lot for me to take

Where do we
Where do we
Where do we
Where do we
Where do we
Where do we

I hope I'm right when I'm speaking my mind
Where do we

I hope I'm right when I'm speaking my mind

I hope my life is no sign of the times

I hope my life is no sign of the times

I've been looking for the golden trees
I don't wanna see the killing on those leaves
Haven't we all
Haven't we all
