I'm a fool now that it's over
Can you guess my name?
I make my money singing songs about you
It's my claim to fame
When they say it's over
it's not all over, there's still the pain

And I'd come running
I'd come running back to you again
Oh I'd come running
I'd come running back to you again

If I said I was sorry
would you still leave me?
I never thought you'd go
'til you did, believe me
When they say it's over
it's not all over completely

'Cause I'd come running
I'd come running back to you again
Yes, I'd come running
I'd come running back to you again

I miss that girl

The show is over
and we must all go home
Just leave me by myself
I'll be alright here on my own
If it's all over, it's all over
And I'm all alone

And I'd come running
I'd come running back to you again
Don't you know I'd come running
I'd come running back to you again

Lord oh my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,
my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Oh tra la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
Lord oh na, na, na, na, na, na, na, now...
