When I'm next to you the sky is the limit
I get the best of you
We're connected by the soul and the spirit
I know you through and through
Time keeps moving a thousand miles a minute
No, some things never change (some things never change)
I'm not losing you and don't you forget it
No, I could never stray
Keep giving me all your love
I'll give you every, everything I got
Keep giving me all your love
I'll give you every, everything I got

Keep giving me all your love
I'll give you every, everything I got
Keep giving me all your love
I'll give you every, everything I got

It's for love
It's for love

It's for love, for love, for love, for love (it's for lo-o-ove)
It's for love, for love, for love, for love (it's for lo-o-ove)
It's for love
Keep giving me all your love
I'll give you every, everything I got
Keep giving me all your love
I'll give you every, everything I got

Keep giving me all your love
I'll give you every, everything I got
Keep giving me all your love
I'll give you every, everything I got
It's for love, for love, for love, for love (it's for lo-o-ove)
It's for love
It's for love, for love, for love, for love (it's for lo-o-ove)
It's for love
