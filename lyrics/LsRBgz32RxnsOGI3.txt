Riding high on an angel's wings
And a devil sings inside my head
Oohhhhh ohhhhh
All alone on a Friday night
With an empty bottle by my side
Oohhhhh ohhhhh

And now I'm looking for the reasons why I'm alive
And now I've finally come to realize
I can't erase
This feeling
I can't escape
And now I'm lying on the floor
And I really need to find the answers
Lying on the floor cause I've given every piece of me
And I'm breathin

(And I'm breathin)

Now the lights are flashing
And I'm crashing to the other side
Oohhhhh ohhhhh
Need another time around
Get me off the ground give me one more try
Oohhhhh ohhhhh

And now I'm looking for the reasons why I'm alive
And now I've finally come to realize
I can't erase
This feeling
I can't escape
And now I'm lying on the floor
And I really need to find the answers
Lying on the floor cause I've given every piece of me
And I'm breathin

And they prayed for
Can he make it through
I'm not leaving
I'm not leaving you

Riding high on an angel's wings
And a devil sings inside my head
Ohhhh oohhh
Waking up from a dream I'm in
And the nurse walks in she looks and says
Ooohh ohhh
And everything will work out right

I can't erase
This feeling
I can't escape
And now I'm lying on the floor
And I really need to find the answers
Lying on the floor cause I've given every piece of me
And I'm breathin
I can't erase
This feeling
I can't escape
And now I'm lying on the floor
And I really need to find the answers
Lying on the floor cause I've given every piece of me
And I'm breathin
