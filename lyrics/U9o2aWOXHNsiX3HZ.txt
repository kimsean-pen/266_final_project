Chewed up, I've been kicking rocks, kicking shit
I've been rolling off that 8-1, don't try this
Narcotics in my bloodstream, I don't feel a damn thing
Moral of the story: don't die kids

See, I just want a little when that bass hits
Listen to my words: don't do this
Yeah, I'm not insecure, I'm stupid
So stupid

I'm sorry that I scared your mother
Plus I'm sorry that your dad died
Now I don't wanna start no trouble
But I got a couple rules you should live by

Take drugs, stay high
View the fucking earth from the outside, yeah
Pop pills through the day time
And if I die tell my mumma that I died like a rockstar
Fuck the cop car, they will never catch us
Like a rockstar, living too fast, like a rockstar

Birds sing when the drugs hit
I feel my heart kick
Double up the dose, go brainless
Break necks in the mosh pit
And if I bleed then I drink codeine
Go painless

See, I don't sniff lines when my friends do
Ten girls lined up for the band's room
And if you don't get high, don't pretend to
It's kinda sad dude

I never meant to scare your mother
But she ain't never met my type (Yeah, no)
And I've been fucking hoes and poppin' pillies, shouting Stoney
But it's not just how I feel, this is real life

Take drugs, stay high
View the fucking earth from the outside, yeah
Pop pills through the day time
And if I die tell my mumma that I died like a rockstar
Fuck the cop car, they will never catch us
Like a rockstar, living too fast, like a rockstar

Tell 'em that I died like a rockstar
Tell 'em I got high like a rockstar
Put me in design, and they put me in the dark
Keep my legacy alive like a rockstar

Lifestyle, on the edge, give me your forgiving
See I worship the dead, they worship the living
I done popped a molly, got my geek on, weed blowing
Make this shit your motherfucking theme song, yeah

Take drugs, stay high
View the fucking earth from the outside, yeah
Pop pills through the day time
And if I die tell my mumma that I died like a rockstar
Fuck the cop car, they will never catch us
Like a rockstar, living too fast, like a rockstar

Like a, like a, like a rockstar (rockstar)
Fucking rockstar (oh, no, oh-oh)
