Oh abysmal thoughts pushing me down to the ground
Oh abysmal thoughts, please

Take me away from this dark place
All I wanted to do was love you
How could you do this to me?

Oh abysmal thoughts pushing me down to the ground
Oh abysmal thoughts, please
Oh beautiful thoughts where have you gone now
Oh beautiful thoughts, please

Who have I become?
Is there no way to come back?
Oh how could you do that to me?

Oh abysmal thoughts pushing me down to the ground
Oh abysmal thoughts, please
Oh beautiful thoughts where have you gone now
Oh beautiful thoughts, please

Oh abysmal, abysmal, abysmal
Oh abysmal, abysmal, abysmal
Oh abysmal, abysmal, abysmal
