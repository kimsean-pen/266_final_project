Under the surface
We're all the same
Searching for purpose
I'm sorry I'm not
All the things that you want
All the things thought I should be
I guess I'm not like you
Not something you're not used to
Maybe something brand new, you've never seen

Wish I could read your mind
Come on let me inside
I'll never waste your time

Wish you could somehow see
That i will always be all that you want from me

Tell me who's to blame
Do you feel better?
Causin me pain
So much pain
I'm sorry I'm not all the things that you want
All the things that you thought I should be
I guess I'm not like you
Not something you're used to
Maybe something brand new you've never seen

Wish I could read your mind
Come on let me inside
I'll never waste your time

Wish you could somehow see that I will always be
All that you want from me

It's my time it's my turn
But I need to make this on my own
You're not right I'm not wrong
so just let me go
I'm sorry I'm not all the things that you want
All the things that you thought I should be

Wish I could read your mind
Come on let me inside
I'll never waste your time

Wish you could somehow see
That I will always be all that you want from me
You gotta let it
You gotta let it go
You gotta let it go
