We were together since we were five
She was so pretty
Emma was a star in ev'ryone's eyes.
And when she said she'd be a movie queen
Nobody laughed
Her face like an angel
She could be anything.

Emmalene. Emma
Emmalene
I'm gonna write your name high on that silver screen.
Emmalene
Emma
Emmalene
I'm gonna make you the biggest star this world has ever set

At seventeen we were wed
And worked day and night to earn our daily bread.
And ev' ry day
Emma would go out searching for that play
That never ever came her way.

You know
Sometimes she'd come home so depressed
I'd hear her crying in the back room

Feel so distressed.
And I'd remember back
When she was five

To the words that used to make
Emmalene come alive.

It was Emmalene
Emma
Emmalene

It was cold and dark
December night

When I opened the bedroom door

To find her Iying still and cold up on the bed;
A love letter Iying on the bedroom floor

It read:

Darling, I love you
But I just can't keep on living on dreams no more
I tried so very hard not to leave you alone.
I just can't keep on tryin' no more

Emmalene - Oh Emmalene- Emmalene
