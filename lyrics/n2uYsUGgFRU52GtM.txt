Sick of this ceiling and tired of the bedroom floor
Swimming in the hallways, looking for an open door
I've tried to sleep, I've sung these songs before
They come back to me in different colours

These shadows and numbers are staring me down
Yeah, I hate the feeling they're hanging around

Ah, maybe this time, maybe this time we'll be fine
We could make shapes out of old ways
Watch them fight the sky
The mind is a cage no bird is used to
When we fly, whatever we make is never a waste of time

Breathing my demons
Funny how they all blow smoke
Talking to the good ones
And laughing at the songs we wrote
I've had this dream,
a little less intense when I'm sleeping (When I'm sleeping)
And my tongue keeps speaking different colors

These shadows and numbers keep staring me down
Ooh, you know I hate it when they do that
