Yo yo, yo yo
Yo yo, aye, aye
Aye aye, aye aye
Aye aye, aye aye
Aye aye, aye aye

Aye yo, I'm wilding like Lemony Snicket
I throw 4 with cause, what the world was his ticket
Topped off the Tek and I can't even fit it
I'm smoking on loud so I probably don't hear it
Make-Making niggas say my name when he in it
I married his Will but I'm not Jada Pinkett
I'm counting -I'm counting-I'm counting up, Bitch

Finger lickin', you know I'ma eat I don't need no utensils
I get attention he need Ritalin
Rollie my wrist I can't fuck with no minute man
OG diet body lookin' like cinnamon
I'm the nigga and these niggas be feminine (niggas be bitches)
I'm smokin' on G in the Tesla (Yes)
Treat the world like its my bitch, bet not touch her
Pretty little bitch, I might fuck around and bust ya
Niggas know I get my coin like a usher
Tool with the gang you ain't big enough
We don't give a fuck if a bitch a feelin' us
Kickin' that hoe out my section
I ain't throwin' no bread if that bitch ain't thick enough
Can't lay the pipe Aretha o tell him just give it up
Niggas they still wanna lick it up
I don't care if I'm that brinks truck
I'ma still hit my plug like nigga come fill it up (Gas)

Franklins Aretha (Rest up)
Two seater I need it
Ice on me (Froze)
You ain't even believe me
Rollie on, ain't got no time for a bitch
Gotta remind me a bitch (Big Dreezy)
Drippin' I'm fly with this shit
If I want it he gon' by me this shit

Checked your resume and you ain't official
A knockoff substitute, I'm the teacher
Heard you sent for me, but I ain't one to miss you
Put paper on you bitch, you don't want no issue
Bitches just running in circles
That shit just come up when I search you
I'm in your screen no commercial
He kissing me say I'm a Hershey
I'm fully loaded, body built like Coca Cola
I'm reppin' the game, no controller
Can't put my life in your Motorola
I got some lil titty's don't need a bra
No bitch, I don't give a fuck 'bout the blogs
Ooh yeah, blow fat as fuck
Faden up look like I'm smoking a log
Chockin up front I walk in the event and I'm throwing up money
Done with your hoe, I'm dumpin' em off like I'm flicking a blunt
Stunt hard, Knievel, flexin'
Rat hoes, policing FEDs
On fire, a phoenix
True shit, believe me
