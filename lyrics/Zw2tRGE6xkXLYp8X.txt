Here we are!

Can you tell that story? It's my favourite one
I'm a fucking disappointment, I can't entertain you anymore
These stupid states of mind
(Everyone!)
Punishing me all the time
But don't cross your boundaries and think that it's cool
Misguided by darkness and lost on the road

I'm such a sucker for the rain

Here we are,
crashing once again into the centre of your moonlit face, our caved in ribs
Your tears, they fall on my tongue and our lips are letting go
We lay on the side of the road

Go!

Pull the trigger tight and watch our distances explode
(Explode!)
If distance seems forever where's your home sweet home?
If anything should happen to me, I'll want you to know
I've loved you since, ever since then
Don't dance around me, I know what it means
No communication cannot be received

But I'm such a sucker for the rain, yeah
(Oh)

Here we are!
Crashing once again into the centre of your moonlit face, our caved in ribs
Your tears, they fall on my tongue and our lips are letting go
We lay on the side of the road

Don't... chase... your... nightmares!

Yeah!

Here we are
Crashing once again into the centre of your moonlit face, our caved in ribs
Your tears, they fall, our lips are locked and let the girls in
I can never let them, never let them go

The side of the road

So take a deep breath and chase them with mine!
Your southern hearts would tell a deep, wild mind!
