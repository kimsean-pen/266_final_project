Reckless men
So righteous, so clean
Towards the light
So bashful, so pure

Who told you to abandon life
Your strength, free will
And bow for the light? The light
And turn from the spinning wheel

Fear of the judgment, obey

You have the key to mystery
Pick up the runes, unveil and see
Judgment comes, before us lie
The paths of war and you may die

You have the key, cross over and see
The old and wind-cold tree
Walk the steps
And you'll hear the winds that cry

You have the key to mystery
Pick up the runes, unveil and see
Judgment comes, before us lie
The paths of war and you may die

You have the key, cross over and see
The old and wind-cold tree
Walk the steps
And you'll hear the winds that cry

Search beyond the blinded eyes
(Listen before you preach)
Don't leave yourself behind

Honor life, when life has ceased
(Welcome the dawn)
Beware the glory tales

Watch their deeds, so just and fair
Crusaders, appointed by God

Who told you to
Step inside and preach?
Did you forget
The daggers lurking in the dark?

Couldn't you listen
Or didn't you ever learn how?
Were you saved? Were you saved?
So you could slaughter with grace?

You have the key to mystery
Pick up the runes, unveil and see
Judgment comes, before us lie
The paths of war and you may die

You have the key, cross over and see
The old and wind-cold tree
Walk the steps
And you'll hear the winds that cry

You have the key to mystery
Pick up the runes, unveil and see
Judgment comes, before us lie
The paths of war and you may die

You have the key, cross over and see
The old and wind-cold tree
Walk the steps
And you'll hear the winds that cry

Search beyond the blinded eyes
(Listen before you preach)
Don't leave yourself behind

Honor life, when life has ceased
(Welcome the dawn)
Beware the glory tales

Hold on, don't fade away
Don't be afraid to bleed
Don't be afraid to dream

Hold on, don't fade away
Don't be afraid to bleed
Afraid to dream
Let the elders enlighten the path
They have cried for you, died for you

Ride on, ride on
Ride on, ride on
