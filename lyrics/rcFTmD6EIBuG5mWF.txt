Lo and behold, baby
These are the things you make me do
Katherine Wheel, I'm burnin' for you
I'm burnin' for you

Come on and break me a limb at a time
Wrap me around your spokes so tight
There's no letting go
Spin me around to blur the line between you and I
What are you waiting for?

Lo and behold, baby
These are the things you make me do
Katherine Wheel, I'm burnin' for you
Please don't stop until my heart no longer screams
Katherine Wheel
Katherine Wheel

Holding hands won't be enough
In a world giving head to a gun
Love in Theory and Practice
Chapter One

Lo and behold, baby
These are the things you make me do
Katherine Wheel I'm burnin' for you
Please don't stop until my heart no longer screams
Katherine Wheel
Katherine wheel

I twist and turn
In your arms swirl
The dizzier I get the clearer I see
With you I'm at peace with the war within

Lo and behold, baby
These are the things you make me do
Katherine Wheel I'm burnin' for you
Please don't stop until my heart no longer screams
Katherine Wheel
Katherine Wheel

Lo and behold, baby
These are the things you make me do
Katherine Wheel I'm burnin' for you
Katherine Wheel I'm burnin' for you
Katherine Wheel I'm burnin' for you
Katherine Wheel
Katherine Wheel
I'm burnin' for you
