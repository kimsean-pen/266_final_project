I get a feeling morning and evening
Baby when you get home
I got a vision, my superstition's gone

Baby, I'm shining, you got me flying
Throw me a silver line
Pull me down slowly
Kiss me and hold me tight

We can't hide it, we can't fight it
Just feel as you believe

I put a spell on my heart for you
Wishin' on a little star for you
Kinda magic in everything we do

I'd live and I'd die for you
Get a little bit high for you
Forever couldn't come too soon
Running circles round the moon

I'm moving over, you're getting closer
Heaven is in your eyes
Mystical wonder flowing into our lives

Spirits are waking to love that we're makin'
Angels are on our side
Watchin' and waitin', catching the joy we cry

We can't hide it, we can't fight it
Just to feel as you believe

I put a spell on my heart for you
Wishin' on a little star for you
Kinda magic in everything we do

I'd live and I'd die for you
Get a little bit high for you
Forever couldn't come too soon
Running circles round the moon

Out of my mind
Chasin' circles of love
Just to find every lifetime
It's always you

I got a spell on my heart for you
Wishin' on a little star for you
Kinda magic in everything we do

I'd live and I'd die for you
Get a little bit high for you
Forever couldn't come too soon
Running circles round the moon

Spell on my heart for you
Wishin' on a little star for you
Kinda magic in everything we do

I'd live and I'd die for you
Get a little bit high for you
Forever couldn't come too soon
Runnin' circles round the moon
