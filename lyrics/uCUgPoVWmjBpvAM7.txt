My mistakes are clearer
As my time here slips away
I'm scared of the mirror
I am trapped inside me

Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free

My life is a tight noose
That I tighten every day
The lies that I've used to deceive myself
Are getting deeper, deeper in my head

Is there a place for me where I can hide?
From my eyes and my mind
Every pill I've ever tried
Tastes dull after a while

There's no rest for me when I sleep
Or lie still for weeks
Now when I wake there's a pause
Then my mind knows it's still waiting for you to

Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free

Will it be peace for me when I die
Or will a piece of me still cry?
Waiting for another end
For the heat death to descend

Will I feel a chill on the night?
That the last star's last light
Dims to nothing
And the darkness unfolds

Is there time after death?
Or does it freeze with my last breath?
Is there time till my death?
Here as a test?
Or is it the only chance I have
To beg you to

Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free
