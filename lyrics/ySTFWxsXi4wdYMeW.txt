Skankin', groovin', hallelujah
Skankin', groovin, help me Jah Jah
Skankin', groovin', under pressure

Under the pressures of life and it tough
Nuh stay down mama, time fi get up
Nuh bother with the downful style, strictly upful vibes and pick it up
When the bills dem, the rent and the mortgage due (weh' mi chalice)
When your best friends are gone and its only you
Light up a spliff turn up the music

And who say life nuh hard
And every man got their struggle
