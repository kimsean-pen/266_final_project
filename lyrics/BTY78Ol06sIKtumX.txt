If one drink can make tonight slip my mind, then I
Should drink up so I can forget that I have lived my life
You are an example of better things to come
So I'll wait on some other escape that leads me nowhere fast
I've gotta ask

You've got nothing to lose
Except for me and you
And I don't want that attitude
When you know I can do, I'll do better than you

If one can drink can make tonight slip your mind, then you
Should drink up so you can convince yourself that I'm cute
We are an example of why not to fall in love
It takes a turn, and then it hurts
More than you could dream of

When you've got nothing to lose
Except for me and you
And I don't want that attitude
When you know I can do, I'll do better than you
And you've got nothing to prove
Oh, no, wait, yes you do
You wear it so well that we think it's true

You can't stay, I want you gone
You're pulling the carpet I was standing on
You can't stay, I want you gone
You're pulling the carpet I was standing on
You can't stay, I want you gone
You're pulling the carpet I was standing on
Here's the exits, exits, exits

You've got nothing to lose
Except for me and you
And I don't want that attitude
When you know I can do, I'll do better than you

We are an example of
(Why not to fall in, why not to fall in love)
We are an example of
(Why not to fall in, why not to fall in love)
