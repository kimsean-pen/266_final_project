I can feel it
All around me
I can see your
Love inside me
I feel stronger
When I'm close to you
I can hear you
Know you're coming
By the way my heart is beating
You're the reason
Sky is turning blue
You make me feel high
I turn to you when I hear you call
You make me feel high
I can't get enough of your love
You make me feel high
I know you're the one I was waiting for
All of my life
I've been waiting too long
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
I've been waiting too long
I can see your
Light is burning
I can feel the wind is turning
In the distance
I can see your face
Love's a promise
I believe it
It's a journey
I can make it
Cause you lift me
To another place
You make me feel high
You make me feel so high above
You make me feel your love's enough
You give me... you give me love!
(I can't get enough of your love)
Come on my light, give me love
You make me feel so high above
You make me feel your love's enough
You give me... you give me love!
(I can't get enough of your love)
Come on my light, give me love
