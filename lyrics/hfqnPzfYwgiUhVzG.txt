Baubles, bangles, hear how they jing-jing-a-ling-a
Baubles, bangles, bright shiny beads
Sparkles, spangles, my heart will sing, sing-a-ling-a
Wearing baubles, bangles and beads
I glitter and gleam so
Make somebody dream
So that someday
He may, buy me a ring, ring-a-ling-a
I've heard that's where it leads
Wearing baubles, bangles and beads
Baubles, bangles, hear how they jing-jing-a-ling-a

Sparkles, spangles, my heart will sing, sing-a-ling-a
Wearing baubles, bangles and beads
I glitter and gleam so
Make somebody dream
So that someday
He may, buy me a ring, ring-a-ling-a
I've heard that's where it leads
Wearing baubles, bangles and beads

I glitter and gleam so
Make somebody dream

He may, buy me a ring, ring-a-ling-a
I've heard that's where it leads
