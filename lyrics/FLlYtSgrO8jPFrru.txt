In the blue of this night
Where it ends in the light
When you couldn't sleep
You would come for me

Wonder eyes, motion high
And I don't dare, slip on by
Make us suffer, like no other
Is nothing like lapis lazuli
Let it go, back to me

Like no other you can't be replaced
Like no other you can't be replaced
Like no other you can't be replaced
Like no other you can't be replaced
Like no other you can't be replaced
Like no other you can't be replaced
Like no other you can't be replaced
Like no other you can't be replaced
Like no other you can't be replaced...
