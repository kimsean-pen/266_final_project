Need someone but mustn't hurry
Something more but don't you worry
Need some time but mustn't hurry
Saw the blood but it's not scary

Need a song but mustn't hurry
Something more but don't you worry
Need some time but mustn't hurry
Saw the blood but it's not scary

Babies pushing boundaries
Babies pushing boundaries
Drove out in the morning
Where shame is going to burn
Shame is going to die

I'm feeling weak
A beast to seek
Licking my fingers
Got the last crumb
My curiosity
Found a cavity
And something to stick in

Got my own family
Got my babies
My own family
Got my babies
My own family
Something to stick in
