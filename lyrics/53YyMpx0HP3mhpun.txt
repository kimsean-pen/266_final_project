I love the way you walk,
Don't you know you're a cool motivator?
Love the way you walk
Love the way you walk

I love the way your eye
Does shine like an Egyptian ruby
Love the way it shines
Love the way it shines
Shine on!

I love the clothes you wear,
They're so mean, they're so free, they're so handsome
Love the clothes you wear
Love the clothes you wear

I love the broken crown,
The one you stole from the King and held for ransom
Love the broken crown
Love your broken crown
I love it!

I love the golden cat,
You know, the one that you keep in your bedroom
Love the golden cat
Love the golden cat

I love the velvet hat,
You know, the one that caused a revolution
Love the velvet hat
Love the velvet hat
I love it!

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Love the way you walk
Love the way you walk
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Love the way you talk
Love the way you walk
Walk on!
