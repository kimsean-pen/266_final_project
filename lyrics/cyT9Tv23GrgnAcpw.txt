Old friend of mine,
Down by the sea side,
Skipping stones,
We watch the changing tides,
Far from home,
Now we sleep in rolls
Stories told,
Walkin down windy roads

The water flow,
Down in the valley,
Where we arose,
And hike the mountain side,
Cobblestones,
All through the cities,
On the road,
We've come to know that
Time is all we have

So we go.
And won't look back.

We will run
With a heart that is oh so young
We have come
To a place we can go as one
We will run

We found a place
Among those five towns
Along the coast
Where colors came to life
On the road
So many faces
Both young and old
We've come to klnow that
Time is all we have

So we go.
And won't look back

We will run
With a heart that is oh so young
We have come
To a place we can go as one
And ohh
My life
Was lost in time
But now
I see
My heart is free

We will run
With a heart that is oh so young
We have come
To a place we can go as one

We will run
With a heart that is oh so young
We have come
To a place we can go as one
