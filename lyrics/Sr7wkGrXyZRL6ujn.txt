Whoo, yeah.
Sometimes I wake up in the dark night.
And in my mind there's a picture of you.
I know someday this dream will come alive.
So for now your shadow will do.
I've never seen your face but I know you're in my heart.
Baby some day, some place, I'll hold you in my arms.

I have a gift for you. Something I've held on to.
Waiting for your sweet caress. (Sweet caress.)
No ribbon has been untied from all that I hold inside.
And only you will possess
This heart of innocence.

I lay my head down on a pillow of white.
Here in the dark, I am cradled in peace.
No loss from yesterday to harm me at night.
No tears to dry. No sad memories.
There's a heart to hold and I will safely keep
The strength that's in my soul
Until you come to me.

I have a gift for you. Something I've held on to.
Waiting for your sweet caress.
No ribbon has been untied from all that I hold inside.
And only you will possess
This heart of innocence.

Every night I make a wish before I fall asleep. (I'll make a wish.)
That destiny will take your hand and lead it to me.
Oh.
I have a gift for you. Something I've held on to.
Waiting for your sweet caress. (You know I'll be waiting there for you.)
No ribbon has been untied from all that I hold inside.
And only you will possess
This heart of innocence.
Ohhh. OhhhI have a gift for you. Something I've held on to.
Waiting for your sweet caress. (Sweet caress.)
No ribbon has been untied from all that I hold inside.
