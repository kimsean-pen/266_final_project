You doubt your strength or courage, don't come to join with me
For Deth surely awaits you with sharp and pointy teeth
An animal so vicious no others fought and won
So on the fields of battle, we are the chosen ones

Human bones blanket the dirt of the heathen's lair
That we must pass this den of Deth, the only path from here
But I walk in the light, the time to die has come
No one shall take my life, I am of the chosen ones

Black shadows fill the sky as the creature's eyes grow near
Raise the shield of the holy pilgrim high into the air
Heaven's powers fill my arms, onward now to fight I'm sent
Oh, the beast is coming to put you to the test

Look out!

Now this land is mine to pillage
Rape and steal and take at will
Never let you cross this path
I reign for now, I stay
I stay to kill!

You doubt your strength or courage, don't come to join with me
For Deth surely awaits you with sharp and pointy teeth
An animal so vicious no others fought and won
So on the fields of battle, we are the chosen ones
