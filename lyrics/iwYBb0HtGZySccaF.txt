Well, this is just a simple song
To say what you done
I told you about all those fears
And away they did run
You sure must be strong
And you feel like an ocean being warmed by the sun
When I was just nine years old

I swear that I dreamt
Your face on a football field
And a kiss that I kept
Under my vest
Apart from everything
With the heart in my chest
I know that things can really get rough

When you go it alone
Don't go thinking you gotta be tough
To bleed like a stone
Could be there's nothing else in our lives
So critical... As this little hole
My life in an upturned boat
Marooned on a cliff

You brought me a great big flood
And you gave me a lift
Girl, what a gift
Will you tell me with your tongue
And your breath was in my lungs
And we float up through the rift
I know that things can really get rough
When you go it alone

Don't go thinking you gotta be tough
To bleed like a stone
Could be there's nothing else in our lives
So critical... As this little hole
Well, this isn't be a simple song
To say what you done
I told you about all those fears

And away they did run
You sure must be strong
And you feel like an ocean
Being warmed by the sun
Remember walking a mile to your house
A glow in the dark?
I made a fumbling play for your heart
And the yet struck a spark
You wore a charm on the chain that I stole
Special for you
Love's such a delicate thing that we do
With nothing to prove
Which I never knew
