Forever

It's been hours seems like days, since you went away
And all I do is check the screen to see if you're okay
You don't answer when I phone guess you wanna be left alone
So I'm sending you my heart my soul and this is what I'll say

I'm sorry, oh so sorry
Can't you give me one more chance
To make it all up to you

E-mail my heart and say our love will never die, and I
I know you're out there and I know that you still care
(I know you care)
E-mail me back and say our love will stay alive
Forever, E-mail my heart

I can see you in my mind
(My mind)
Coming on the line
(On the line)
And opening this letter that I've sent a hundred times
Here's a picture of us two
(Us two)
I look so good on you
(On you)
And can't you please forgive me
For the hurt I put you through

I'm sorry, oh so sorry
Can't you give me one more chance
To make it all up to you

E-mail my heart and say our love will never die, and I
I know you're out there and I know that you still care
(I know that you still care)
E-mail me back and say our love will stay alive
Forever, E-mail my heart
(What you say, what you say, what you say)

I'm sorry, oh so sorry
Can't you give me one more chance
To make it all up to

E-mail my heart and say our love will never die, and I
I know you're out there and I know that you still care
(I know that you still care)
E-mail me back and say our love will stay alive
Forever, forever
(What you say, what you say, what you say)
Forever, E-mail my heart
(What you say, what you say, what you say)
