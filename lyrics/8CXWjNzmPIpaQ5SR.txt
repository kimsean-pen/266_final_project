Hide the key
'Cause I'm coming over
To settle the score (whoa, whoa)
Don't forget how well I know you
Stop asking and keep dancing.
You don't stand a chance, girl
You'll fall apart
Stop talking with your hands, Girl
You'll have to start
Over, over again
Maybe I'll call him up and call you out
Maybe next time you should turn around
Over, over again
Put, put, put your heart where your mouth is
And put, put, put your heart where your mouth is now
Hide the key
'Cause I'm coming over
To settle the score (whoa)
(do, oooh, do, oooh)
Stop asking, and keep dancing
You think that I am blind girl
My eyes were always floating in your wine girl
You'll have to starve
Over, over again
Maybe I'm the one that plays the game
Maybe I tend to make the same mistake
Over, over again
Baby, you should put, put, put your heart where your mouth is
And put, put, put your heart where your mouth is now
Hide the key
'Cause I'm coming over
To settle the score (whoa)
Don't forget how well I know you
I'll take, take, take you down
(do, oooh, do oooh)
Stop asking and keep dancing
(do, oooh, do, oooh)
Stop asking and keep dancing
I'm talking 'bout change
You really want to see the way
But if you want to see
Then you need to settle down
We are talking 'bout change
You really want to see the way
But if you want to see
Then you need to settle down, down, down, down
Hide the key
'Cause I'm coming over
To settle the score (whoa)
Don't forget how well I know you
I'll take, take, I'll take, take you down
(do, oooh, do, oooh)
Stop asking and keep dancing
(do, oooh, do, oooh)
Stop asking and keep dancing
