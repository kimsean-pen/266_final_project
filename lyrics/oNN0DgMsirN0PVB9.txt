Eyeline the driveway
Eyeblack the door
Sky all around me
Levels life from roof to floor

Trees and knees are lovely
Seek it, find the core
I have grown to life
Like all in silence, wait for more

Everywhere with helicopter
Hard to follow when I'm slow
Everywhere with helicopter
Sending off where lightning goes

I will try to fight them
I will let them nowhere to go
Try escape the pace
I'll say God bless you, let me know

We know the answers
We fill us in
I do not diminish
Start to finish, front to end

Everywhere with helicopter
Hard to swallow when I'm slow
Everywhere with helicopter
Censor of the lightning ghosts

Everywhere with helicopter
Hard to swallow when I'm slow
Everywhere with helicopter
Sending off where lightning goes
