I may not have a job but I have
something that is much more valuable than this
I may have a couple friends well I'll be damned if I didn't
Owe me, owe me,
everybody owes me a price to seek for my account to pay
I'll keep drinking passion tea just to get the taste of it
Just to get the taste of it

Screeching guitars

Stings and bites are contagious and I
just might try to keep them to myself
Bees and dogs are as harmless as frogs in your basement
Tell that guy I'm sorry that I lied to and made everyone upset, again
I'll keep up with the reporting on all of these events
On all of these events

Screeching guitars

I may not have a job but I have
something that is much more valuable than this
I may have a couple friends well I'll be damned if I didn't
Owe me, owe me,
everybody owes me a price to seek for my account to pay
I'll keep drinking passion tea just to get the taste of it
Just to get the taste of it
