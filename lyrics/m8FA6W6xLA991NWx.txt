So many silhouettes tonight
All have their own special goals
Did you come to take my heart?
I'm here to find my silken part
A summer ride
A summer heatwave
So many silhouettes defaced
Searching for an hour to waste
There's a glance i took to heart
I'll cry to find my silken part
A summer ride
A summer heatwave
A hurricane, a desperate struggle
A trouble nest, a blur
A summer rave, a banging muddle
The fire
Enslaved to the burning crowd
Dazzling light is making me blind
