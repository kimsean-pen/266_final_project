My life is all that I've known
And it's all that keeps me here
My time is all that I own
So I won't let it slip away...

How long can this life go on
Who we are what we are...
I'll see you on the other side

Wouldn't you rather live it on your own
Even when it bends you over
So when it comes time to go home
You don't let them fade away...

How long can this all go on?
How long till it's over?
And how long till it all comes down?
...And how bad do we need a new reminder?

How long can this life go on
Who we are what we are...
I'll see you on the other side

How long can this life go on
Who we are what we are...
I'll see you on the other side

How long can this life go on
Who we are what we are...
I'll see you on the other side

I'll see you on the other side
I'll see you on the other side
