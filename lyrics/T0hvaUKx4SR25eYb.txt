Hello, goodbye all my lovers
(Time is ticking) the sun is going down, down, down
I'm sitting in my teacup, spinning
Watching the world slowly drown, drown, drown
In this house that has taught me nothing
People ask why not burn it down?

I feel like a rag doll
All those flowers on the cop car
Black cat in a top hat
Can't wait no more, can't wait no more
And I feel like spring has begun
And I'm dancing with the wild ones
Wake up children and let it be
We sail on the ocean and the seven seas

And I go go go go...
No no no no
I can't take it anymore

Well, what you got isn't always what you need
But you got me on the floor
What ya gonna do with me?
And you, you hide away in that, that secret place
I promise I won't do no harm on this good lords day

But I feel like a rag doll
All those flowers on the cop car
Black cat with a top hat
Can't wait no more, wait no more
And I feel like spring has begun
And I'm dancing with the wild ones
Wake up children and let it be
We sail on the ocean and the seven seas

But I go go go go...
No no no no
I can't take it anymore

And I feel like a rag doll
All those flowers on the cop car
But I'm much too tall
I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting to catch you now

And I'm feeling like a rag doll
And I'm waiting on your god now
But I'm much too tall
I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting to catch you now

I don't care what they say
I'm floating away
Far, far away
Lost in the mental estate
They say I'm okay
As they're dragging me away

Through the doorway
Through the pathway
I see the maps on the back of my hands
They don't hesitate
They don't compensate
They only see the truth of the damned
But they want you
And they need you
And they take what you got
And they'll kill you where you stand
My friend, my friend

I don't care what they say
I'm floating away
Far, far away
I don't care what they say
I'm floating away
Far, far away

Through the doorway
Through the pathway
I see the maps on the back of my hands
They don't hesitate
The don't compensate
They only see the truth of the damned
But they want you
And they need you
And they'll take what you got
And they'll kill you where you stand
My friend, my friend

I don't care what they say
I'm floating away
Far, far away
Lost in the mental estate
They say I'm okay
As they're dragging me away
