I'm the young father of every great boy
Don't let them catch you in my sights
Who's seen my father sees nothing at all
I saw my father, he's blinding

Over time, pretty lies
Break angels, break angels

On the holy night, no end of day
I felt the light, I lie awake
On the holy night, no end of day
You are the light, I am the way

I'm the young father of every great boy
Don't let them catch you in my sights
Don't say my father took any cheap whore
In me, my father's still fighting

Over time, pretty lies
Break angels, break angels

On the holy night, no end of day
I felt the light, I lie awake
On the holy night, no end of day
You are the light, I am the way

Over time, pretty lies
Break angels, break angels
Oh, can you perfectly recite
So I may hear those pretty lies?
Break angels

On the holy night, no end of day
I felt the light, I lie awake
On the holy night, no end of day
You are the light, I am the way
On the holy night, no end of day
I felt the light, I lie awake
On the holy night, no end of day
You are the light, I am the way
