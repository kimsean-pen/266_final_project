Peace be unto thee, unless you want a piece of me
Whose side are you on?
You can't hide
You can't run
You wage war on life,
Logic lost in brainwashed minds
Storming heaven, it's not too late
Hit them hard, crash the gates
I see your way of life and I think it's a joke
"Don't step out of line, you're walking a tight rope!"
Before long I'll be dead and gone
Locked up for the firing squad
Old guard changes hands
This will be your last stand
You had yours
I want mine
Second chance: Denied
I see your way of life and I think it's a joke
"Don't step out of line, you're walking a tight rope!"
Before long you'll be dead and gone
Locked up for the firing squad
Warfare everywhere?
I shudder the thought!
Lined up with the firing squad,
Now take your best shot!
