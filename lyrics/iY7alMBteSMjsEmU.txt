I wish I could simplify
But I don't
I see you (?)
Never know more
How I wish you'd be dignified
But it's no use
And I'll sing for a simple life
While I swing from the noose
Enough

We're falling like fireflies straight from the shore
Waiting to realise we're caught in the storm
All of your compromise and all of your talk
Fade out with no surprise and swallow you whole
Enough

Delegate your unison
Waiting for the click of desire
Navigate your fingertips
Watch the apple fall from his eye
So down we came into your home
Taking all our scriptures' design
Never were you all alone
All he want's a piece of the pie

So don't you feel the colours as they fade?
Ripples in an ocean of the same
(?)
So help me forget
