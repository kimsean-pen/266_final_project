In slavery of the blood thirst
Drink from their hearts
If your brother shows mercy
Tear him apart
Apart

Follow me through the winds that curse our name
Out into the land of the slain

Drink from their hearts
Tear their bodies apart
Assemble the wicked
Their souls will be lifted

These machines will not see defeat
As they sever your arteries
Mindless skeletons under control
Slay them all 'til their blood is cold
Watch the limbs fall at your feet
Move your eyes
Through which I can see
With your hands tear through their flesh
Don't bother cleaning the mess
Kill all the rest

Beg to be freed
You're wasting your breath
As you try and speak
Under siege
Brought to your knees
Your imminent death awaits as you plead
Suffering

Follow me
Follow me
Into the land of the slain
Cursing their names we ride
Follow me
Follow me
Into the land of the slain
Cursing their names tonight
