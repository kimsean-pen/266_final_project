Chill down, I'm doing great
Doing well is pretty vague
Single mama I wanna get that number
You look as strong as you did before

But you know old time, one to one
Class historian

You cut in line, you cutting cake
You cut in line, it was a big mistake
But you can get back in, you can get back in
You know that you're cutting ties when you're cutting time

You know old time, the tired one
Class historian

You know you'll never gonna let your sue√±os
You know you really gonna wet my dream
But you know you get it up, you gotta get that number
You look the same as you did before
But you can get back in, you can get back in
You know that you're cutting ties when you're cutting time
But you can get back in, you can get back in
You know you're catching the fever
You know you're catching the fever, you know that
You know old time, the tired one
Class historian
You know old time, the tired one - you it's a
Class historian
You know old time, the tired one - you it's a
Class historian
Back then, you could get back then or
You could get back then
You know i'ts a Class Historian
