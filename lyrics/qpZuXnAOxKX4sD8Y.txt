Hey angel
Consider, your position
Framed to be consumed
Savory...
Savoring, your sympathy
Hey angel
Fly over, and bless me
See you feign surprise
Well I'm all eyes
And you're all you
Need to be
Hey angel
whatever, position
We consider fit, to put you in
You'll protest your... complicity
Easy now...
One hand will wash the other (2x)
Hey angel
Fly over, and bless me
See you feign surprise
And I'm all eyes
And were are we?
He thought me (3x)
Easy now...
One hand will wash the other (2x)
