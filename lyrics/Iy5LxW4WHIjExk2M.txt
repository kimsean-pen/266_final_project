Go to imaginary parties in our make believe Ferrari
Baby, let's get fresh, I know we know how

Come a little closer, baby, we can pretend like I'm the new kid in town
Take me for a ride around if that's what you like, but if you're driving I'm down
We can make a movie, baby, you can be Gable and I can be West
Call me Tarantino, because you and me know that it's what I do best

I, oh, I, oh I want to make it better than it's ever been before
And I, oh, I, oh, I gotta keep, gotta keep you coming back

If it's all we ever wanted, than baby play along
'Cause it makes me feel alive
Go to imaginary parties in our make believe Ferrari
Baby, let's get fresh, it's like we just met

If you wanna catch fire, we'll get a little hotter
Wanna keep you satisfied
Just you and me together in out imitation leathers
Baby, let's get fresh, I know we know how

Tell me about your fantasy 'cause I can do anything and don't ya hold back
I can call the shots and you can call me what you want, oh baby, how about that
I can be a doctor if you show me what hurts and I can make it alright
We can have a slumber party, you show me yours, and I'll be showing you mine

I, oh, I, oh I want to make it better than it's ever been before
And I, oh, I, oh, I gotta keep, gotta keep you coming back

If it's all we ever wanted, then baby play along
'Cause it makes me feel alive
Go to imaginary parties in our make believe Ferrari
Baby, let's get fresh, it's like we just met

If you wanna catch fire, we'll get a little hotter
Wanna keep you satisfied
Just you and me together in out imitation leathers
Baby, let's get fresh, I know we know how

If it's all we ever wanted, then baby play along
'Cause it makes me feel alive
