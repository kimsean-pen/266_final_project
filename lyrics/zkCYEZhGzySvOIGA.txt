Sorrowful stories
I hear all that's shown
His posturish shiver on his things
And she's always known
Things from the forest die here
But I don't
Dead forest things are offered here
But I'm not

Their faith never cries
Giving in, getting in
Wishing what her sad grin finds
Things from the forest die here
But I don't
Dead forest things are offered here
But I'm not
