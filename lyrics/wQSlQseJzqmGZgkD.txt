Silence shields the pain, so you say nothing
Feel they've rigged the game and you're done with lovin'
Only you can see the darkness in the northern lights

Phoenix from the flames, we will rise together
They will know our names, can you feel it?
Shelter me from pain, I always wanna feel this way, oh yeah
Just like a phoenix from the flame

Wish they'd take you back 'cause you miss Heaven
Too many bags to pack, so leave them where they are
Tonight, you're flying on a golden dream

Phoenix from the flames, we will rise together
They will know our names, can you feel it?
Shelter me from pain
I always wanna feel this way, oh yeah

Everybody's talking, nobody's listening
Too busy thinking about what you've been missing
Everybody said "You're gonna take it too far, baby, now"
Well come on

When you're done with lovin'
It comes down to nothing
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

Phoenix from the flames, we will rise together
They will know our names, can you feel it?
Shelter me from pain, I always wanna feel this way, oh yeah
Just like a phoenix from the flame

Phoenix from the flames
They will know our names, can you feel it?
Shelter me from pain, I always wanna feel this way, oh yeah
Just like a phoenix from the flame

Why don't you come and deny it?
You know you can't deny it
I always wanna feel this way
Just like a phoenix from the flames
