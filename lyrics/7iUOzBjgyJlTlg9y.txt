Going down a last act scene
Curtain call begin bowing
Self-appointed abuse king
Hellbound, that's my belief

Black eat white, cassette thrill
Whatever come, eat your fill
Choke on bones, flowing stream long stilled
The truth is to some degree we all steal

Hey now
Come 'round
Hellbound
Going way down

Justified, a self-made man
All I do is do what I can
Edges sharpened, blasted sand
Bizarre, devoted fan

Black eat white, cassette thrill
Whatever come, eat your fill
Choke on bones, flowing theme blown will
The truth is to some degree we all steal

Hey now
Come 'round
Hellbound
Going to stay down

Washington, a fish belly rust
Sad chapter read last page first

Black eat white, cassette thrill
Whatever come, eat your fill
Choke on bones, flowing dream now killed
The truth is to some degree we all steal

Yeah...

Hey now
Come 'round
Hellbound
Going way down
