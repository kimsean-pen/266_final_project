Do you like this song?
What the **** was that?

What do you want to hear repeatedly on the radio this year?
(Something that sounds like the music I already listen to, but with different words)
(Don't know really, if its on, I'll listen to it)
We've got guitars and track tunes, anything else is a bonus

Well, it's pretty good, but ya know, I need to ask my friends what they think first
