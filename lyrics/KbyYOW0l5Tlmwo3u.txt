Well, I looked at her face
And then I knew she changed
My heart turned black

And then the sky turned gray
Yeah, my heart turned black
Then the sky turned gray

And so I sat in my room

For twenty seven days
No she never called
I had something to say
No she never called

I had something to say
Well, I don't know much and I don't know how
Why would she put me through such torture

I would have given my life for her
She was the one that knocked me over
Now I'm alone sitting on the corner

Well, I heard she's great

And her new boyfriend's lame
Well, she can go to hell
I'll never be the same
Well, and she can go to hell

I'll never be the same
And these open wounds
Will heal with time they say
Yeah, my heart turned black

And then the sky turned gray

Yeah, my heart turned black
And then the sky turned gray
Well, I don't know much and I don't know how
Why would she put me through such torture

I would have given my life for her
She was the one that knocked me over
Now I'm alone sitting on the corner
Why would she put me through such torture
I would have given my life for her
She was the one that knocked me over
Now I'm alone sitting on the corner
Well, I don't know much and I don't know how
Why would she put me through such torture
I would have given my life for her
She was the one that knocked me over
Now I'm a alone sitting on the corner
Why would she put me through such torture
I would have given my life for her
She was the one that knocked me over
Now I'm alone sitting on the corner
