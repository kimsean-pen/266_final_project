I feel the rain on my skin
Wash away all the pain I was in
I see the sun in the sky
No longer know how it feels to cry
And it really doesn't matter
So what? So what?
That I've been hesitating so long, so long

Somebody turn up the light
'Cause right now must be my time to shine

They said I couldn't, they told me that I wouldn't
But if they could see me now
They'll see I'm something, that I'm not scared of nothing
And the world will hear me shout
We sing oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Might call me crazy
But I've been thinkin' maybe you would change your mind
If you could see me now

Drop me in the ocean, I'll swim
Put me in with the lions, I'll roar
There's a survivor within
So much stronger than I was before

They'll never saw me coming
So what? So what?
'Cause they been sleepin' on me so long, so long
I'd rather leave that behind
'Cause right now must be my time to shine

They said I couldn't, they told me that I wouldn't
But if they could see me now
They'll see I'm something, that I'm not scared of nothing
And the world will hear me shout
We sing oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Might call me crazy
But I've been thinkin' maybe you would change your mind
If you could see me now

They said I couldn't, they told me that I wouldn't
But if they could see me now
They'll see I'm something, that I'm not scared of nothing
And the world will hear me shout
(I'm not scared now!)

They said I couldn't, they told me that I wouldn't
But if they could see me now
They'll see I'm something, that I'm not scared of nothing
And the world will hear me shout
We sing oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Might call me crazy
But I've been thinkin' maybe you would change your mind
If you could see me now
