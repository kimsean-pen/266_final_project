I see you drivin' round town
With the girl I love
And I'm like "Fuck you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh!)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like "Fuck you, and, uh fuck her too"
Said if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that some shit? (Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "Fuck you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh!)

Yeah I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari, huh
But that don't mean I can't get you there, huh
I guess she's an XBox, and I'm more Atari, mmm
But the way you play your game ain't fair, uh

I pity the fool that falls in love with you, uh-oh
(Oh shit, she's a gold-digga)
Well

Ooh, I've got some news for you, uh-huh

I see you drivin' round town
With the girl I love
And I'm like "Fuck you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh!)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like "Fuck you, and, uh fuck her too"
Said if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that some shit? (Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "Fuck you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh!)

Now I know, that I had to borrow, huh
Beg and steal, and lie and cheat, uh
Tryin' to keep ya, tryin' to please ya
'Cause being in love with your ass ain't cheap, nah

I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(Oh shit, she's a gold-digga)
Well
(Just thought you should know nigga)
Ooh, I've got some news for you, huh
