First to get a part
Of all the last to know
It was nothing at all
The flowers of emotion never fall
There is something you need
That others long to know
But it's one thing I
Decided to hold on to long ago

Sugar can
Sugar can not

Something there
Is in a burst of life
Let's waste it now
And watch it die

First to say I mind
What others have to know
When we're cruel to be kind
The flowers of emotion never hide
Is there somewhere in here
That I would love to know
Where it's perfect
I'll decide that I
Prefer to never go

Sugar can
Sugar can not

Something there is
In a burst of light
Let's waste it now
And watch it die
