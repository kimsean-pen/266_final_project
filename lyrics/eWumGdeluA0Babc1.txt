How can I change the world
If I can't even change myself?
How can I change the way I am
I don't know, I don't know

[Incomprehensible], tell me
[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible], tell me
[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible], tell me
[Incomprehensible]

I wanna take a look at the world behind these eyes
Every nook, every cranny reorganize
Realize my face don't fit the way I feel
What's real?

I need a mirror to check my face is in place
In case of upheaval, fundamental movement below
What's really going on I wanna know
But yo, it don't show on the outside, so slide
Just below my skin I'm screaming

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me

I need a mirror for my spirit, yeah, can you hear it?
When I get deep, want to hear myself sleep
Not drowning, tumbling around and around in the voices
Like a crowd in my head so loud

I wonder what it's like to be dead
I hope it's quiet, noise in my head like a riot
Any remedy you have for me I'll try it
Just below my skin I'm screaming

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me

I'm going deep, so deep that I can't sleep
The pills ain't cheap but the bills are steep
So I lick up with a booze and a sniff, try to snooze
But who's dreaming, this is win or loose

Put down the drink, try not to think
Let it go, fundamental movement below
And yo, reality is dreaming
Just below my skin I'm screaming

[Incomprehensible], tell me
[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible], tell me
[Incomprehensible]

[Incomprehensible], tell me
[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible], tell me
[Incomprehensible]
