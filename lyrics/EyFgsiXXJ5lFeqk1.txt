Son of man
You're on your own
The coming winter
You'll face alone

The heart that you cherished so
The hand that you tried to hold
Belong to a stranger
But a vision you crafted

Alone you came into this world
Came into being
Alone you are still when you're leaving
When you're waning

Hounds of winter
Bay at the moors

Demons of loneliness
Bide at your door now

Not one heart that would stay true
Not one soul that bleeds for you
They'll turn away
One dreary day

Alone you're in this world
In the middle of it all
If you keep holding on
It will hurt even more

Only one who stays
Only one who waits
Your shadow by your side
Only friend in life
