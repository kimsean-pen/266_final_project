She,
she used to live near his brother.
Now she's an unmarried Mother
with another on the way.
He's second rate,
twisted out of shape.
It costs so much to look this rough.
They go to town,
they like to shop around
and look at all those things.
All those things they never wanted anyway.
She hates his hair,
that stupid coat he wears
but sometimes second best
is the best that you can get.

Oh somebody told me;
the seconds turn to hours
and the hours turn into days
but still it feels like the morning.
The first time leaves its trace
and then slides into second place
and still it feels like the morning.
At night they try to fly,
hold on tight and close their eyes
and they make it through to the morning.

In the morning it's raining.
Oh christ you're always complaining,
can't you think of something else?
It's nearly-nu,
a bargain basement made for two
and if you blur your eyes you could be anywhere you want yourself to be.
Oh yeah it's bad,
I know you want to laugh,
so laugh.
But sometimes second best
is all you're gonna get.

Oh yeah, oh somebody told me;
the seconds turn to hours
and the hours turn into days
but still it feels like the morning.
The first time leaves its trace
and then slides into second place
and still it feels like the morning.
At night they try to fly,
hold on tight and close their eyes
and they make it through to the morning.
the seconds turn to hours
and the hours turn into days
but still it feels like the morning.
The first time leaves its trace
and then slides into second place
and still it feels like the morning.
At night they try to fly,
hold on tight and close their eyes
and they make it through to the morning.
My god they're still alive;
they got it wrong but they still tried
and they made it through to the morning.
