And I like it when you smile
And you got real cool style
And I don't mind if you were mine
You are the cutest girl in town

You should be my girl
And I'll give you everything
You should be my girlfriend
I'll love you forever
You should be my girlfriend
and I'll take you home with me
You should be my girlfriend
I'll love you forever baby

And I like it when you move
I want to dance all night with you
and when the night ends
stick with me
and we'll see where this stuff leads.

You should be my girl
And I'll give you everything
You should be my girlfriend
I'll love you forever
You should be my girlfriend
and I'll take you home with me
You should be my girlfriend
I'll love you forever baby

You should be my girl
And I'll give you everything
You should be my girlfriend
I'll love you forever
you should be my girlfriend
and I'll take you home with me
you should be my girlfriend
I'll love you forever baby.
