Called my brother, yelling out
I fell in love and then fell out
And I don't know if I can take the hit
I let a stranger in my bed
I pretended you were him
Cause I needed to feel wanted

I gotta oh, I gotta find another way
I'm learning to live
I'm trying to be better
I'm learning to give

But I don't know if I'm a giver
I'm learning to live
I'm trying to be better
I'm learning to give
But I don't know if I'm a giver

Every day's another shot
But all I do is fuck it up
Screaming cause I've got it too good to cry
I put the medicine inside my head
Apologize for all the things I said

Girl it takes guts to just survive

I gotta oh, I gotta find another way
I'm learning to live
I'm trying to be better
I'm learning to give
But I don't know if I'm a giver
I'm learning to live
I'm trying to be better
I'm learning to give
But I don't know if I'm a giver
But I don't know if I'm a giver
But I don't know if I'm a giver

I got so much soul in my body
But no one keeping me honest
And whole days turn into holes in my mind
I got high hopes lots of potential
I'm high, broke, searching for symbols
And I will not let go of what is mine
I got so much soul in my body
But no one keeping me honest
And whole days turn into holes in my mind
I got high hopes lots of potential
I'm high, broke, searching for symbols
And I will not let go of what is mine

I'm learning to live
I'm trying to be better
I'm learning to give
But I don't know if I'm a giver
I'm learning to live
I'm trying to be better
I'm learning to give
But I don't know if I'm a giver
But I don't know if I'm a giver
