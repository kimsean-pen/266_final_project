Across every ocean
For the sake of locomotion
Across an every ocean
For the sake of locomotion

Across every ocean
For the sake of locomotion
But I wouldn't have a notion
How to save my soul

I walk down the sidewalk
Run down the boardwalk
Stop and make small talk
But I can't say no to you

I can't say no, I can't say yes
I can't even write down my own address
I can't touch Heaven, it's a little too far
It's the only way to travel, got dreaming on a parr

I'm staring through the window
Wonder where you are
Moving through the landscape
At a million miles an hour

Across every nation
From the harbor to the station
It's a form of inspiration
It's a power to the state

They run down the railways
Sail across the seaways
Fly through the airways
But they can't say no to you

I can't stand up, I can't stand still
I know you wouldn't like it if I told you how I feel
I just want to say that it's only common sense
But the words always fail me at my own expense

I'm staring out the window
Wonder where you are
Moving through the landscape
At a million miles an hour

Across every ocean
For the sake of locomotion
But I wouldn't have a notion
How to save my soul

Across every ocean
For the sake of locomotion
But I wouldn't have a notion
How to save my soul

I walk down the sidewalk
Run down the boardwalk
Stop and make small talk
But I can't say no to you

Across an every ocean
For the sake of locomotion
Across an every ocean
For the sake of locomotion

Across an every ocean
For the sake of locomotion
Across an every ocean
For the sake of locomotion

Across an every ocean
For the sake of locomotion
Across an every ocean
For the sake of locomotion

Across an every ocean
For the sake of locomotion
Across an every ocean
For the sake of locomotion

Across an every ocean
For the sake of locomotion
Across an every ocean
For the sake of locomotion
