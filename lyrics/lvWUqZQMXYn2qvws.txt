I lived my life alone before you
And with thoughts that I'd never succeed into love
And I grew so accustomed to that kind of solitude
Ah, 'fore you I did not know how to give it up
Before you, had I ever known love
Or had I only known misuse
Of the power another had over me
The power another had over me

I'll cross the country and I carry no key
Couldn't all look up at the stars from anywhere?
And sometimes I did, I felt ancient
But still I sought peace and it never came to me
They often spoke as though I have been set free
But I traveled only service of my dreams
I stood before them all, I was a sleepwalker

Couldn't hold my misery down
Not even for you
It bore me on all the places I ever gone
I grew so accustomed to that kind of solitude
But that long for you now, even when you just leave the room

Of all the roads in the cities that I passed through
Of all of the eyes that I searched inside
The one sense of permanence I felt was mine

Only beneath your gaze
