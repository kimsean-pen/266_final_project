Roll my tape
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Thirty days...
Anyone doin' that one?
(Which one?)
I'm doin' that one

Thirty days in the hole
(Yeah, that's nice)
Thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole
(Lord have mercy)

'Come on in man, that's it. Yeah. Right.

Alright, alright, alright, alright yeah
Chicago Green, talkin' 'bout Red Lebanese
A dirty room and a silver coke spoon
Give me my release, come on
Black Nepalese, it got you weak in your knees
Sneeze some dust that you got buzzed on

You know it's hard to believe
Thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole
That's what they give you

Thirty days in the hole
Newcastle Brown, I'm tellin' ya, it can sure smack you down
Take a greasy whore and a rollin' dance floor
It's got your head spinnin' round
If you live on the road, well there's a new highway code
You take the urban noise with some dirt with poison

It's gonna lessen your load

Thirty days in the hole
That's what they give you now
Thirty days in the hole
Oh, yeah
Thirty days in the hole
All right, all right

Thirty days in the hole
How you doin' boy
You here for thirty days
Get, get, get, get your long hair cut

And cut out your ways
Black Nepalese, it got you weak in your knees
Gonna sneeze some dust that you got buzzed on
You know it's so hard to please
Newcastle Brown can sure smack you down
You take a greasy whore and a rollin' dance floor

You know you're jailhouse-bound
Thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole
Oh, yeah
Thirty days in the hole
Thirty days, thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole
Thirty days in the hole
