Packing your bags like people in the movies do,
All severe, and not saying a word,
And I'm sitting down here just watching you,
And I'm thinking
Where has all the love gone?
Where's the love gone to?

Don't leave,
You got me hurting,
Don't leave
You know it's never been easy to love someone like me,
Oh, don't leave.

Hanging with friends like we used to do,
I didn't know anything was wrong,
And last night well I was thinking it through,
Trying to find who am I and what d'you need me to do?
Don't leave.
There's a record you used to play,
there's Joni singing 'best to be without you',
And I know just what she's singing
Where did all the love go?
Where's the love gone to?
Don't leave.
You got me hurting,
Don't leave.
You know it's never been easy to love someone like me,
Oh, don't leave.

Where did all the love go?
Where's the love gone to?
Don't leave.

We'll fly around the world, give you what you're giving me,
I should have dressed you up in pearls,
Finest silk to touch your skin,
Don't know how to write a love song,
But Don't leave.
You got me hurting,
Don't leave.
You know it's never been easy to love someone like me,
Don't leave
Don't leave
Don't leave
Don't leave
