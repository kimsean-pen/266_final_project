When the words
Weigh heavy on the heart
I am lost
And led only by the stars

Cage me like an animal
A crown with gems and gold
Eat me like a cannibal
Chase the neon throne

Breathe in, breathe out
Let the human in
Breathe in, breathe out
And let it in

Plants awoke and
They slowly grow
Beneath the skin
So breathe in, breathe out
Let the human in

The air is silk
Shadows form a grin
If I lose control
I feed the beast within

Cage me like an animal
A crown with gems and gold
Eat me like a cannibal
Chase the neon throne

Breathe in, breathe out
Let the human in
Breathe in, breathe out
And let it in

Plants awoke and
They slowly grow
Beneath the skin
So breathe in, breathe out
Let the human in
Cage me like an animal
A crown with gems and gold
Eat me like a cannibal
Chase the neon throne

If I could only let go...
