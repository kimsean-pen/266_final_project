I'm looking outside of my windows
The view that I see
Is a child and mama
And the child is begging for money

Tell me why, tell me why
The woman is blind is she so broke
The kid's dealing crime

It's such a beautiful city
But the world is burning it down

Yea yea yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
It's such a beautiful city
But the world is it burning down

I go to my room to turn on the T.V
I sit myself down
And I start laughing hard
'Cause this man he's asking for money
He sats "if you send me lots of cash I'll send you
Stuff to make you rich fast"

It's such a wonderful country
But the man he's burning it down

Yea yea yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
It's such a wonderful country
But the man he's burning it down

Yea yea yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
And it's burning down
And it's called the U.S of A.

One day I'm going to have lots of money
But I'll have to give up
For this rich society
Oh please Mr. President will you lend me a future
'Cause you'll just get it back
From the little blind woman
With the kid on the corner
And the people all over, doin' crack

Yea yea yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
It's such a wonderful country
But the man he's burning it down

Yea yea yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
And it's burning down
And it's called the U.S of A.

I'm walking outside on a sunny day
With no one around
And I wonder what's wrong
The I hear this loud piercing siren
Oh my God the bomb has just dropped
And everybody climbed right on top
Screaming, what a wonderful country
But the man he's burning it down

Yea yea yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
It's such a wonderful country
But the man he's burning it down

Yea yea yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
And it's burning down
And it's called the U.S of A.
