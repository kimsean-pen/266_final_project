Hidden chamber beneath the earth
Built with stone and very dark
Hiding lost atomic arms
From a war never fought
Malicious schemes devil's own
Weapons under his control
Overlord splits the ground aiming for the sky
A strike for the holy one, now it's time to die

...

Nuke the cross!
...
Wall of fire glowing bright
Lightning cracks across the sky
Warheads boiling to extremes
Religion is now history
Pit fiend in the hellish planes
Master of his domain
Sounds of the angels crying

Heard throughout the night

A strike for the holy on, now it's time to die
...
Nuke the cross!
...
Your savior can't retaliate
Can't fight against this storm of hate

Brought on by years of lies
Cast right out from the skies
Using stockpiles made by man
Stronger than we can grasp
Missiles launched encased in black
Aiming for the sky
God can't defend this strike
Now's his time to die
...
Hahahaha
