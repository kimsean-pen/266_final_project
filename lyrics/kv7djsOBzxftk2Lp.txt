Run, why should I run away
When at the end the only truth certain -
One day everyone dies -
If only to justify life.

Live, I've lived a thousand lives;
And anyone is the right, the just life.
If I could cry, I'd cry for everyone.

Doubts, no doubt, is all I know.
There is no fate, there's no luck,
what does that show.

Showing is proof, but proving is nothing but fear.
If I could cry, I'd cry then for everyone.

Hope, I've hoped two thousand years, but
no one hears, so I've cried, crying vain tears.
Always too late, too late to cry, cry for everyone.
