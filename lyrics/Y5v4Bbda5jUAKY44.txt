I believe that reality's gone, disillusion's real
I believe that morality's gone and there's nothing to feel
If you take the sacred things, the things that we hold dear
Empty promise is all you'll find so give me something

Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in

I believe in a changing of the guard, put our feet on the ground
See it happen in your own backyard, everything breaks down
Do you accept what you are told, without even thinking
Throw it all and make your own and give me something

Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in

Where they lead you will follow
Well I guess that's just the way it goes
And if you'll go away, you'll be doing what they say
An if you look alive, you'll be singled out and tried

If you take home anything
Let it be your will to think
The more cynical you become
The better off you'll be

Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in

Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in
Something to believe in
