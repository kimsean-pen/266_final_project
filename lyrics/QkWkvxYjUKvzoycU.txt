I built these wings (I built these wings with broken things)
With broken things (with broken things found strewn in me)
Found strewn in me (found strewn in me my nemesis)
My nemesis (my nemesis)

I break and bleed (I break and bleed, I tear then feed)
I tear then feed (I tear then feed, the wretchedness)
The wretchedness (the wretchedness inside of me)
Inside of me (inside of me)

I know where my hate truly hides
Front and center behind these eyes

Chaos
Reigns

It bites and holds (it bites and holds)
With fangs so old (with fangs so old)
That loathsomeness (that loathsomeness so bitter cold)
So bitter cold (so bitter cold)
