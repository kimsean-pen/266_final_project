A quick fix, it tastes great
By my God doesn't it make space
In my wallet only got loose change
How many times will I hit my snooze again

This fires gonna burn
You're gonna me me turn
Naturally, naturally
It'll take a little time
But I'm gonna make you mine
Naturally, naturally

(naturally)
Naturally, naturally
(naturally)
Naturally, naturally

Your words, there all straight
By my God you spin it in your ways
And my jackets always covered in stains
I'll pick you up in my old rust bucket again

This fires gonna burn
You're gonna me me turn
Naturally, naturally
It'll take a little time
But I'm gonna make you mine
Naturally, naturally

(naturally)
Naturally, naturally
(naturally)
Naturally, naturally

(naturally)
Naturally, naturally
(naturally)
Naturally, naturally

This fires gonna burn
You're gonna me me turn
Naturally, naturally
It'll take a little time
But I'm gonna make you mine
Naturally, naturally

Naturally, naturally
(naturally)
Naturally

Naturally
Naturally, naturally

Naturally, naturally
