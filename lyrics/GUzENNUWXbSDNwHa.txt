I've been trying to deny it
Oh, what to do
When I'm such a fool for you

I want you
So bad I want you
I want to hold you babe, you look away, what did I say?
I want you

For better or for worse
I will make you mine
Each warm heart gets cold in time
No follow like a shadow
You won't get through
The web I have spun for you

I want you
So bad I want you
I want to hold you babe you look away what did I say?
I want you
So bad I want you
I want each step you take, I will not bend, I will not break

I want you bad
I want your innocence
I want your bitterness, your loneliness
I want you (I want you)

I want you bad
I want your innocence
I want your every breath in life or death, I want you

No one could see it coming
A tragic day (a tragic day)
How did that car get in your way?

I got you
At last I got you
She'll never see your face forever bound in my embrace

I got you
At last I got you
She'll never send you thrills, if I can't have you, no one will
