You think that I'm invincible
It's gonna pull me down, pull me down
You think that I'm invincible
I'm going to pull me down to somewhere I don't wanna go
It's OK

You think I'm indestructible
It's gonna pull me down, pull me down
You think that I'm a miracle
I'm going to pull me down to somewhere I don't wanna go
It's OK

I don't know what you want from me
But it's probably already gone
I don't care what you think of me
Your opinion means nothing at all

Don't say I'm OK
Don't say I'm OK
Don't say I'm OK
I'm not OK

Don't say I'm not trying
Trying to do what's right
Now it's time to walk away

I don't know what you want from me
But it's probably already gone
I don't care what you think of me
Your opinion means nothing at all

Don't say I'm OK
Don't say I'm OK
Don't say I'm OK
I'm not OK
