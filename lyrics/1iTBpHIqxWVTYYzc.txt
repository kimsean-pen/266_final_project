Propaganda

On joyless lanes we walk in lines
a calm but steady flow.
Accompanied by loud commands
our strength is running low.

Another hope feeds another dream
another truth installed by the machine.
A secret wish the marrying of lies
today comes true what common sense denies.

Rotating wheels of destiny inflame the city lights.
Machines call out for followers far out into the night.
The calls of the machines drowning in the steam.

Another hope feeds another dream
another truth installed by the machine.
A secret wish the marrying of lies
today you find is true what common sense denies.

The calls of the machines drowning in the steam.
On joyless lanes we walk in lines
a calm but steady flow.
Our strength is running low.

Another hope
another dream
another truth
installed by the machine
installed by the machine.
