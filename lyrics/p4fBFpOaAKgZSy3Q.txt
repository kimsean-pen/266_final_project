Sticks and stones don't break my bones,
you make believe
It's lock and load
it's a dead end road to you and me
And I'm rusted gold,
I'm stripped and sold
I'm make believe
And I'm off the rent
I haven't spent
I guarantee

So can you not go away if just for one day
Uh-uh-uh, impossible, possible
How'd you do now?
How'd you do now in a war?, War sends out for you
Don't throw your fortune away and I can't get enough
SPACE!
SPACE!
SPACE!
Get enough space

I'm pale and coy, a momma's boy, I'm make believe
I shimmy-shake, I wake the bed, I'm over me
My lungs defeat, I cannot breathe,
don't follow me
And you push and shove
I've had enough
You mess with me

So can you not go away if just for one day
Uh-uh-uh, impossible, possible
How'd you do now?
How'd you do now in a war?, War sends out for you
Don't throw your fortune away and I can't get enough
SPACE!
SPACE!
I can't get enough space
SPACE!

(I can't get enough space)
(Can't get enough space)
