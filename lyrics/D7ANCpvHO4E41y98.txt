Here soon, here soon
Here soon, here soon

Loving alone is what you make it (make it)
Stay for the storm if you can take it (take it)
But pray for a rainbow
Go up to where they're blind to
Mistakes
I know you worry a lot
I'll be here for you
Do I care enough?
Do I feel for you?
I can guarantee

Come on, this one
Come on, this one
Come on, this one
Come on, this one

I didn't know you tried
Cause you wanted more
And didn't know you cried
Cause you wanted more
Things don't happen the way you hoped to
I'm just keeping a little hope, baby
I didn't know you tried
Cause you wanted more

Dying my day dreams in your bedroom (bedroom)
Waiting so long, said you'd be here soon (here soon)
How could you forget that
I'm the one who
Forgot all your mistakes
And dirty trash
You know I care for you
One hell over earthquake
I stood for you
Will you stand for me?

Come on, this one
Come on, this one
Come on, this one
Come on, this one

I didn't know you tried
Cause you wanted more
And didn't know you cried
Cause you wanted more
Things don't happen the way you hoped to
I'm just keeping a little hope, baby
I didn't know you tried
Cause you wanted more

Funny how life is turning out
I don't have much to talk about
Don't have much to write about
Got a shitload to cry about
Funny the words I do kick
Funny the niggas I do pick
It's funny what sticks
(Go figure)
Mama said I'm sensitive
I gotta work on that
Not really
Tired of using adjectives, I gotta build on that
You feel me?
Not really

Young man, tryna hold the world in a broken hand, hand
Young man, tryna find the world in a broken hand
