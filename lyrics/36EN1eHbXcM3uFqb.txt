Always find myself at the back of the line
Wondering if someone will ever be mine
And I'm not lonely most of the time
But my mother thinks something isn't right
'Cause here I am again at the back of the line
And she'll ask the question every time to time
Like, "Honey it's okay if you don't really like guys"
All my friends have tied the knot
And I'm still thinking that my ex is hot
He's more attractive when he isn't mine
And I don't know why

I hope you're not hoping
Hanging pictures on the wall like I'm a paper doll
If you're gonna hold me
You better take it like a man and watch out for you're hand
I'm never gonna give you what you think
I'm just a paper cut to make you bleed

Always find myself tryna sneak out the back
Maybe it's the chemicals that I really lack?
I'm unbalanced and afraid
Don't say you love me or I'll run away
I never keep 'em long enough to meet my dad
And I don't understand

I hope you're not hoping
Hanging pictures on the wall like I'm a paper doll
If you're gonna hold me
You better take it like a man and watch out for you're hand
I'm never gonna give you what you think
I'm just a paper cut to make you bleed

Cutting into you're skin when you touch me
If I am just paper thin, how could I ever feel you're loving?
Always find myself at the back of the line
Wondering if someone will ever be mine
And I'm not lonely most of the time
But my mother thinks something isn't right
'Cause here I am again at the back of the line
And I don't know why

I hope you're not hoping
Hanging pictures on the wall like I'm a paper doll
If you're gonna hold me
You better take it like a man and watch out for you're hand
I'm never gonna give you what you think
I'm just a paper cut to make you bleed
