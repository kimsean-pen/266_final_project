Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this pussy
Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this pussy
Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this pussy
(She's a motherfucking international sensation)
Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this pussy
(She's not your average showgirl)

I'm still, I'm still right here tonight
So I will, make you cum through the night
Will you touch me, will you go deep in me
I will in the sheets
I will, I will, I-I-I will

She's a mother fuckin' international sensation
She's not your average show girl
Allow Miss Taylor to sing the blues

I'm still, I'm still right here tonight
So I will, make you cum through the night
Will you touch me, will you go deep in me
I will in the sheets
I will, I will, I-I-I will

She's a mother fuckin' international sensation
She's not your average show girl
Allow Miss Taylor to sing the blues

I'm still, I'm still right here tonight
So I will, make you cum through the night
Will you touch me, will you go deep in me
I will in the sheets
I will, I will, I-I-I will

Save your tears honey, you're a mother fucking diva
These fancy cunts can't take you, Miss Taylor

I believe that theres a big future
out there with a lot of beautiful things
I want so much more I want my name to be a
household product in the high fashion world

Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this pussy
Work this pussy, work this pussy, work this...
