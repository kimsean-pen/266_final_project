I made this bed
I choose to lie in it
Live with my regrets
Sleep with what I said
Could this be the end
Am I standing on the edge
Of everything I wanted now
I was afraid
I was afraid

Maybe I'm just scared
To face the things I fear
It's easier to walk away from everything

Separate my soul
With all the things we shared
I'm falling to pieces now
Say a prayer for me (say a prayer for me)
When you go to bed (cuz)
I'm in need of your faith now
I was afraid

Maybe I'm just scared
To face the things I fear
It's easier to walk away from everything
If we could just re-set
And live in happiness
Instead of our regrets we'd salvage everything
We don't have to walk away

Pray for me now
I'm in need of faith
Pray for me now
I'm in need

Maybe I'm just scared
To face the things I feared
It's easier to walk away from everything
If we could just re-set
And live in happiness
Instead of our regrets we'd salvage everything
Maybe I'm just scared
To face the things I failed
It's easier to walk away from everything
Walk away from everything
Walk away from everything
