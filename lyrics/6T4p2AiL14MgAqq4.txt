Think I'm ready
I think I've got it
Cause to much thinking is bad for my health
It's like a fire 'cause when I start it
I can't control it and I burn myself
But I can't just sit here and watch it
If we don't stop it no one will

We are the ones, we are the guns
And we will ride, we are the voice of a song unsung
We are the change, we are the chains that hold us
We are the choice, we are the strong
We are one

My heart is racing, just like a rocket
Victory looks like a distant dream
Cause what we're fighting is not gonna stopped
But we can beat it if we just believe
But I can't just sit here and watch it
If we don't stop it no one will

We are the ones, we are the guns
And we will ride, we are the voice of a song unsung
We are the change, we are the chains that hold us
We are the choice, we are the strong
We are one

We are the ones, we are the guns
And we will ride, we are the voice of a song unsung
We are the change, we are the chains that hold us
We are the choice, we are the strong
We are one

If we don't stop it no one will

We are the ones, we are the guns
And we will ride, we are the voice of a song unsung
We are the change, we are the chains that hold us
We are the choice, we are the strong
We are one
We are the ones, we are the guns
And we will ride, we are the voice of a song unsung
We are the change, we are the chains that hold us
We are the choice, we are the strong
We are one.
