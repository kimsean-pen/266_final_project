Please, you know I rate Queens
Yo, cah that's in my jeans
I don't want grief, don't want drama
I just went out for a little Chinese
Had Chinese then couldn't leave
I lost my phone and my card and keys
Came, came home 4 o'clock
Walk back like... Walk back like a chief

Do me right
You're lying
It's in your eyes, don't try it
No you can't hide, have you lost your mind?
Did I cross your mind?

It's your life, I said I'd never
Let you waste my time
I said you'd never
Hear me say that twice
You crossed that line
You crossed that line

You know what you're doing
I won't listen to, another excuse
This time you blew it
The people you use
Got them jumping through hoops
I won't let you do it
You can't seduce me, now who looks foolish
Sorry but, I know you're type
I won't be undermined

I can take this down to the wire
Soon see if I fight fire with fire
Dig that grave
You're such a bad liar
Stakes getting higher and higher and higher and higher

Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher

You'll be fine, stop crying
Dry your eyes, stop fighting
Rest that mind, give yourself some time
You might like what you find

It's your life, and I said I'd never
Let you ruin mine
I said I'd never, ever
Pay that price
You crossed that line
You crossed that line

Why did you do it?
Why would you choose to use and abuse me?
This close to ruin
Why just stand by
Don't you dare roll your eyes
Why put me through it
Enough with the lies
I know what the truth is
Sorry but, I know you're type
I won't be undermined

I can take this down to the wire
Soon see If I fight fire with fire
Dig that grave
You're such a bad liar
Stakes getting higher and higher
And higher and higher

Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
