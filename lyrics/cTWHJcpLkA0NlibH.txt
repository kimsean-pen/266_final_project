I find you never seem to notice...
But did we miscommunicate?
Oh, and all the things they showed us
They knocked you out but on your face
See how the others do it
They're intertwined
But they're still free
Oh, but you don't wanna hear it
What's it to do with you and me?

How can I love you more?
Tell me, how can I love you more?
How can I love you more?
Tell me, how can I love you more?
I won't only be your baby
How can I love you more?

What now?
Are we moving faster?
Well, do we need to slow this down?
Your mind is what you wanna master
And then you think to come around
But what about me?
Well, tell me, what can I love most?
Sometimes it feels like I'm losing
Step off the heart that's on the floor

How can I love you more?
Tell me, how can I love you more?
I won't only be your baby
How can I love you more?
How can I love you more?
Tell me, how can I love you more?
How can I love you more?
Tell me, how can I love you more?
I won't only be your baby
How can I love you more?
