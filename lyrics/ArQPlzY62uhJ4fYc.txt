Allow your brain the free design
To open up the inner etheric mind
I gotta say, we have a chance
To lead us all to a true hypnotic trance

Nothing has objects
To fool all that's in our head

All of everything outside of our head
Opens the doors where we can fall right in
Every time we go to some place
It's in a song where we can transcend

Everything outside of our head
Opens the doors where we can fall right in
Every time we go to some place
It's in a song where we can transcend

The lobby of celestial storms
Nostalgia for the future is nevermore
I gotta say, we have no chance
To harmonize the future with dissonance

Nothing has objects
To fool all that's in our head
