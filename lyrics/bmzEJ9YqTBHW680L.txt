I'm not gonna sleep tonight
Till the morning fills the sky
No one's getting left behind
This is our time
This is our time

We gonna live this night (Yeah)
Live it like it's our last night
'Cause nobody cares if there's
No tomorrow!

I'm not thinking 'bout the future (future)
It's somewhere out there
We're all busy being human (human)
We remember
Hearts beating all around me (together)
Now
They're surrounding me
This is how we get connected
Running like the shadows into light

We're gonna live this night (Yeah)
Live it like it's our last night
'Cause nobody cares if there's
No tomorrow!
We're gonna love this night (Yeah)
Love it like it's our last night
Stars up in the air (Yeah)
It's our last night in the city

I've been traveling around now (Big world)
With my brothers
Always moving to a new town
No time to put the roofs down
We can't stop believing (Can't stop)
Now we believe in you
'Cause when your standing in the spotlight
The only thing that matters is the night!

We're going to live this night (Yeah)
Live it like it's our last night
'Cause nobody cares if there's
No tomorrow!
We're going to love this night (Yeah)
Love it like it's our last night
Stars up in the air (Yeah)
It's our last night in the city
(Yeah)
Last night in the city
(Yeah)
Last night in the city

I'm not gonna sleep tonight
Till the morning fills the sky
No one's getting left behind
This is our time
This is our time

We're going to live this night (Yeah)
Live it like it's our last night
'Cause nobody cares if there's
No tomorrow!
We're going to love this night (Yeah)
Love it like it's our last night
Stars up in the air (Ooh Yeah)
It's our last night in the city
Yeah
Last night in the city
Yeah
Last night in the city
