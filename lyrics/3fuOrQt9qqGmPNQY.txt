My smile is a rifle
Won't you give it a try?
((Mumbles to self...))

So you like the way it gave to, maybe
When notes come to you, ooo ooo
No ((screeching...)) yea

My smile is a rifle
And what are you?
My smile is a rifle
And I'm pointing it at you
My smile is a rifle
You're always you ((screeching...))
