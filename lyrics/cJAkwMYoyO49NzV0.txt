Toast is burnt
And your coffee's cold
And you leave all the post
'Cause it's nothing but bills again

Home from work
Put the TV on
Get your kicks watching
Bruce on the old generation game

Just dial my number
I've got some plans for you
And I can help you through

Every day seems just the same
Just dial my number
And call my name

Jeans are old
And your hair's all wrong
Don't you know that crew cuts and
Trainers are out again

Going out
You're feeling low
Running for cover
It looks like it's going to rain
(What a shame)

Just dial my number
I've got some plans for you
And I can help you through

Every day seems just the same
Just dial my number
And call my name

Just dial my number
I've got some plans for you
And I can help you through

Every day seems just the same
Just dial my number
And call my name
