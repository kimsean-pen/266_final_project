I got my own, don't need to buy me a drink
Stop asking questions like you care what I think
Cause it's great that you want me

But I come with a warning
So I'mma be real with you, I know what I need

Ain't easy, you gotta earn it
Don't mind just watching you hurt it
Keep trying, practice makes perfect

Baby, know that I come
first, first, first, first, I come first, I come first
Baby, know that I come
first, first, first, first, I come first, I come first

I got my own, don't need to roll me a blunt
Don't ask me questions like you care if I'm dumb
Take my treasure in your hands
Better get with the program
I'll let you stay if you do something I like

Ain't easy, you gotta earn it
Don't mind just watching you hurt it
Keep trying, practice makes perfect

Baby, know that I come
first, first, first, first, I come first, I come first
Baby, know that I come
first, first, first, first, I come first, I come first

Keep me satisfied
I can make your head spin baby
Just look me in the face, ooh
I'mma show you what I like
No, it ain't about you
I gotta get me, myself, and mine

Baby, know that I come first, first, first
Baby, know that I come first, I come first, I come first

Baby, know that I come first, first, first, first, first, first, first, first
first, first, first, first, I come first, I come first

Baby, know that I come
first, first, first, first, I come first, I come first

(Oh, oh, oh)

(Oh, oh, oh)

(Oh, oh, oh)

(Oh, oh, oh)

(Oh, oh, oh)

Baby, know that I come first.
