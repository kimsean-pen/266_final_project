make me talk and set me free
tell me who i'm meant to be
fake originality
everyone is nothing
without resisting all the weak,
would we ever know we're able?
gimme something i can eat,
i need your words i need your power.

i have my money all around
just take your clothes off make me proud
i have my money all around
you look me up i'm crawling down

little boy, i'll never see
everything you mean to me
keep you running on your feet
let your head fall heavy
without resisting all the weak,
would we ever know we're able?
gimme something i can eat,
i need your words i need your power.
i have my money all around
just take your clothes off make me proud
i have my money all around
you look me up i'm crawling down

and the time oh the time it's just running through
and i feel the weight of all we can do
you and me, oh i know there's nothing better yet
say the words take a chance you know you won't regret
and we try and we try but it's still the same
judgement calls and i know that we can't be blamed,
oh i'd leave it all if it weren't for you
understand the fall if it weren't for you.

i have my money all around
just take your clothes off make me proud
i have my money all around
you look me up i'm crawling down
