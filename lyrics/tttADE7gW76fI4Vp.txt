I know I'm buried down there
in the catacombs of your mind
dig deeper and you'll find
a haze of daisy chains and medicated pains
good god, when acid rain floods your brain
from the dirt I will rise
I will rise

The precession's ahead
the heart is behind
the future is fleeting
I'm out of time

Founds words of you? with your? infatuation
my purity is you
take you on midnight city walks on wretched blocks
sick of humiliation
I'm still on the prowl
behind you

The precession's ahead
the heart has been had
the future is fleeting
I'm out of time

Remember how you moved and
I never heard from you again
Sometimes I do pretend
you said that one day you'd come back for me
oh that is the only reason why I'm still a part
of this dreadful scenery

The precession's ahead
the heart is behind
the future is fleeting
I'm out of time

Your hair will return
to it's natural color
You'll move to a new town
and off to another
