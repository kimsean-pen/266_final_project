Self defense, self defense
Self defense, nothing but self defense

Dumb love, dumb fuck
Come out with your motherfuckin' hands up
Now answer, learn to step
Bounce up, [?] wind it
Twerk control, my booty vibing
Cause this no time to be trying to hide it
Got my fellas mixed blood and we [?]
My fast trick, your limp dick
You resist, I insist
Admit defeat, it's my treat
Numb feet then rock to the beat
Lean meat while the angels weep
Just you and me for the time to be
It's a black hole with a white flame
And a tan purse til words of war brain
Lip lock, let 'em drop, [?] pop, it can't stop
Ri-ri-ri-ri-rinse repeat
Make it better then make it sweet

Roll it up, back it all up, [?]
Just don't be late, just don't hate, just don't hate
Just [?] never, just [?] never, just
Just [?]
Wind it, it's fine, you're fussy, [?]

Give it the bounce, bounce
Come up, bounce, bounce
Don't make it stop, the bounce, bounce
Give it the bounce, bounce
The bounce, bounce
Give it up, give it the bounce, bounce
The bounce, bounce
Give it the bounce, bounce
Never stop, just the bounce, bounce
The bounce, bounce
Give it
Some time to bounce
The bounce, bounce
Give it the, the bounce, bounce
The bounce, bounce
Give it the bounce
