We can never let the word be unspoken
We will never let our loving go come undone
Everything we had is staying unbroken, now
You will always be the only one
You're the only one

Won't ever give up cause you're
Still somewhere out there
Nothin' or no-one's gonna keep us apart
Breakin' it down but I'm still gettin' nowhere
Won't stop - hold on

Thunder 'n' lightning it's gettin'excitin'
Lights up the skyline to show where u are
My love is rising the story's unwindin'
Together we'll make it 'n' reach for the stars

You're the only one you're my only one
You're my life every breath that I take
Unforgettable so unbelievable
You're the only one - my only one

I could have told you to slow down 'n' stay down
I could have told you a secret wont u keep it now
Thinking of making a showdown
When love is found
Thinking of waiting till you're around

Won't ever give up cause you're
Still somewhere out there
Nothin' or no-one's gonna keep us apart
Breakin' it down but i'm still gettin' nowhere
Won't stop - hold on

Thunder 'n' lightning it's gettin'excitin'
Lights up the skyline to show where u are
My love is rising the story's unwindin'
Together we'll make it 'n' reach for the stars

You're the only one you're my only one
You're my life every breath that I take
Unforgettable so unbelievable
You're the only one - my only one
Thunder 'n' lightning it's gettin'excitin'
Lights up the skyline to show where u are
You're the only one you're my only one
You're my life every breath that I take
Unforgettable so unbelievable
You're the only one - my only one
