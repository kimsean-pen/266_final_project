Hit the wave pull me under
Cleanse your soul and make it better
Coz I'm afraid of being nothing
So take this life and make it something

For too many times
We let important things into our minds
then its usually too late, to see what made us blind

Be sure that you let people know how much they mean to you
Take the time to say the words before your time is through

Hit the wave pull me under
Cleanse your soul and make it better
Coz I'm afraid of being nothing
So take this life and make it something

We don't realise what we have until it's gone
We wait too late to say I'm sorry I was wrong
Sometimes it seems we hold the words we hold dearest to our hearts
We love foolish things to tear our lives apart

Hit the wave pull me under
Cleanse your soul and make it better
Coz I'm afraid of being nothing
So take this life and make it something

Hit the wave pull me under
Cleanse your soul and make it better
Coz I'm afraid of being nothing
So take this life and make it something
