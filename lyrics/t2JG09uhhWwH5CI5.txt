You wake to grab your shovel
See your breath it's made of tar
It's a subzero archaeological dig to find that artifact of a car
It's a 1992 Corolla with a busted left tail light
But you're always reminded the oil one works right
And all the good old boys are playing bad new songs
On the country station while the city moves on
All the hot young things they don't age like wine
I'm on the bad side of 25
I'm on the bad side of 25
So you swivel out the driveway
Of this tundra you call home
And bumper car your way on back to work
It's a place you hate to know so well
And yet feel so unknown
So you hula the snow off your parka all alone
What I've seen might air supply your hard rock spine
I've lived long enough to see some good friends die
It's a dangerous time to be a friend of mine
I'm on the bad side of 25
I'm on the bad side of 25
Some people fade like evening
Some just never go away
But there's simply no place safer
than the bank the day after the robbery
So you wake to grab the paper
Sip your coffee too much grind
You don't so much mind the aging
You just mind the getting wise
Mix two parts jack with two bloodshot eyes
And you still feel cheated when your buzz subsides
Put your poor old parents through some sleepless nights
Still on the good side...
Still on the good side...
How old will I be when I try to freeze time
And my age degrades into a well worn lie
She looks 18 between you and I?
I'm on the bad side of 25
My line til I slide by 35
Make that the bad side of 45
If you remember the Berlin wall sing it
I'm on the bad side of 25
If you remember before Chernobyl sing it
I'm on the bad side of 25
If you remember before Mike Tyson was the champ
I'm on the bad side of 25
If you remember the Super Bowl shuffle don't sing it
I'm on the bad side of 25
