I hope that you miss me
Put me down on history
I feel such a reject now
Get yourself a life (get yourself a life)
I hope that you're sorry
For not accepting me
For not adoring me
That's why I'm not your wife (that's why I'm not your wife)

People are stranger
People in danger
People are stranger
People in deranged or...

I remember there was
Nothing I could ever do
Never could impress you
Even if I tried (even if I tried)
Tell somebody who cares
Fill the room with empty stares
Go to bed and say my prayers
Keep them satisfied (keep them satisfied)

People are stranger
People in danger
People are stranger
People deranged, ah

Loud and clear, I make my point, dear

I hope that you never
Get the things you wanted to
Now, I cast the spell on you
Complicate your life (complicate your life)
Hope you get a puncture
Everywhere you ever drive
Hope the sun beats down on you and
Skin yourself alive (skin yourself alive)
