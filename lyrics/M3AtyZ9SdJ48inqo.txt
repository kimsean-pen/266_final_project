One dance left.
I don't know who's leading who.
Your arms have gone limp and
I just slipped out of your grasp.

And though we might say that we're alright,
It's clear that we've stepped out of time.
There's something quite telling just there at the edge of your smile.

And it's not that a heart has been broken
It's just sad when the flames start to freeze,
And the sparks that we had can no longer light up our debris.

It's just part of us all growing older,
Facing things that we don't want to see,
Like a heart is a thing ever changing,
And love is a thing that will come and go with the breeze.
