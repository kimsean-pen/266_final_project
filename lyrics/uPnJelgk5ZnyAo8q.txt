I had your back, but it's no use
False accusations are on the loose
Know what?
It makes no sense that you tied your own noose
You never felt the sores decay
Your perfect world is ending today
So what?
I wouldn't have it any other way

Is this your paradise?
You think you thought this through?
'Cause when you rolled the dice
The house came down on you
Don't care what you do or say
Your suicide begins today
Have fun in paradise
This hell is just for you

You against you
Shitty time to make a stand all without a masterplan, just you
You against you

So how's your paradise?
Hindsight just laughs at you
With conflict comes a price
That price weighs heaviest on you
I guess I should say thanks
Dissension in the ranks
Your panic lit the fuel
Now it's you against you

You against you
Wasn't looking for a fight, but I'm showing up tonight
Shitty time to make a stand all without a masterplan, just you
You against you

These seeds are what you've sown
Never should have lit that fuse
Enjoy your paradise
This hell is just for you

You against you
Wasn't looking for a fight, but I'm showing up tonight
Shitty time to make a stand all without a masterplan, just you
You against you
