They changed so much, you know what I'm saying?
How did these two motherfuckers, from New Orleans
How did they change, how did they change music?

Yeah, I was the wave, but now I feel the tide pulling back
Ocean flat
Often I lay, my liver really starting to slack
And like I feel myself decaying from the cigarette packs
I never thought I'd see the 'tussin, I was livin' in the back
I'm blacked out, spare my heart torn in half
Mom, I've got everything I ever wanted
But now I don't want it
It feels like I'm on it, it feels like I'm cursed
Hopefully soon I will turn into dirt
A material world with the nerve
I see what it worth on the out of the curb
Leaving me up on the street of New Orleans

Roll me up a blunt (aye)
I need to get lost (aye)
All y'all talk about sauce, I'm wipin'
Frozen cuts with frost, I'm slicin'
Dope and guts and tossin' fronts up to the side
Half of $uicide
A couple million, now I'm ready to fucking die

Two cuts in a bad bitch
Then I pop me a Xanax, quick
Call Shake when I need that fix
Call Nick when I need that itch
Call crack to the pop, amphetamine
Max Beck in the back, pop seventeen
Yo, I'm Kurt Cobain with the heroin
Say I love drugs over everything
Shoot the stars up in my veins, woah
But look at your bankroll
So, just spend it on more dope
More woes, fuck you care fo'

But lately I feel guilty, I feel so badly
They say I made it and that should be satisfactory
Lately, I feel like I have nobody
All alone in the empty hotel lobby

4am, praying, can I get some rest?
Dreams of $uicide and a need for death
4am, praying, can I get some rest?
Dreams of $uicide and a need for death

Happening now, streets blocked off as New Orleans police continue to
