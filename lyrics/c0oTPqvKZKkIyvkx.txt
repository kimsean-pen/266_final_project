Deep blue, I wanna to take you to the sun
Use the power station at the heart of town
I'm sorry for the news the other day
Let's go and play before they take you down

Deep blue, I wanna to give it all to you
Deep blue, I know that scares you

Deep blue, let's get a train out of town
To a place that's easier to get around
To a place that's easier to get along
To pretend to be strong, deep blue

Deep blue, I wanna to give it all to you
Try and make you laugh, deep blue
Deep blue, I know that scares you
Try and find your smile, deep blue

One place we choose straight
And you make it last more than a day
Starting with a smile then it fades away
So stay another day, deep blue

Deep blue, I wanna to give it all to you
Try and make you laugh, deep blue
Deep blue, I know that scares you
Try and find your smile, deep blue

Deep blue, I wanna to give it all to you
Deep blue, I know that scares you
Deep blue, I wanna to give it all to you
Deep blue, I know that scares you

Deep blue, I wanna to give it all to you
Deep blue, I know that scares you
Deep blue, I wanna to give it all to you
Deep blue, I know that scares you

Deep blue, I wanna to give it all to you
Deep blue, I know that scares you

Deep blue, I wanna to give it all to you

Deep blue, I wanna to give it all to you
Deep blue, I know that scares you
Deep blue, I wanna to give it all to you
Deep blue, I know that scares you

Deep blue, I wanna to give it all to you
Deep blue, I know that scares you
Deep blue, I wanna to give it all to you
Deep blue, I know that scares you

Deep blue, I wanna to give it all to you
Deep blue, I know that scares you
Deep blue, I wanna to give it all to you
Deep blue, I know that scares you
