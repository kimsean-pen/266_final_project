It was three a.m. when you woke me up
Then we jumped in the car and drove as far as we could go
Just to get away

We talked about our lives until the sun came up
And now I'm thinkin' about how I wish I could go back
Just for one more day, one more day with you

Every time I see your face
Every time you look my way
It's like it all falls into place
Everything feels right

Ever since you walked away
You left my life in disarray
All I want is one more day
It's all I need, one more day with you

When the car broke down, we just kept walkin' along
'Til we hit this town, there was nothin' there at all
But that was all okay

We spent all our money on stupid things
But if I look back now, I'd probably give it all away
Just for one more day, one more day with you

Every time I see your face
Every time you look my way
It's like it all falls into place
Everything feels right

Ever since you walked away
You left my life in disarray
All I want is one more day
It's all I need, one more day with you

And now I'm sittin' here, like we used to do
I think about my life and how there's nothin' I won't do
Just for one more day, one more day with you

Every time I see your face
Every time you look my way
It's like it all falls into place
Everything feels right
Every time I hear your name
Every time I feel the same
It's like it all falls into place
And, everything, everything feels right
You walked away, just one more day
It's all I need, one more day with you
