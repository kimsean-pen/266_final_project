Sky looks like nascar
Easter pink colors
Racecars
Everything felt so beautiful
Like I was a kid
I wish
Everything felt like this

Sharp turn
Dim light
Strip mall
Street fight
Card declined
Alright
Alright
Laying in the trunk
I grew up

Golden chain around my neck
Hands counting all my friends
I love them until the end
Love this world until it ends
And I wish everyone felt like this

Sky looks like nascar
Easter pink colors
Fast cars

Sweet dreams
I always wish you well
