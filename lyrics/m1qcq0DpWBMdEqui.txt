The dawn ahead on the floor
The cracks so bare on the way
They like a flood spills away
Way as a world stains
I like it would in the night
And traps the colors away
What is a breath behind your neck
We are the ones that stay
And I'll be watching as you waste through the ground
And I'll be watching as you waste through the ground
And I'll be watching as you waste through the ground
And I'll be watching as you waste through the ground
And I'll be watching as you waste through the ground
