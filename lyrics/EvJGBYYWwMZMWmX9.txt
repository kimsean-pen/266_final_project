Waste, oh oh
Waste, oh oh
Cause time is slipping away
Someone wait, oh oh
Save your soul
Cause time is slipping away so fast
Time is slipping aways so fast

So paint your pictures in your mind
In your mind
It's alright
We dance in circles 'til we're tired
Then we'll rise
Forever

Oh don't you know forever
Never lasts
Never lasts
Oh don't you know forever
Never lasts
Never lasts

Time slipping
Time slipping
Time slipping
Time slipping, slipping

So paint your pictures in your mind
In your mind
It's alright
We dance in circles 'til we're tired
Then we'll rise
Forever

Oh don't you know forever
Never lasts
Never lasts
Oh don't you know forever
Never lasts
Never lasts

Waste, oh oh
Waste, oh oh
