We're just machines rusting to breathe
Hopeless, helpless, deconstructing ourselves
Wanting to be wanted, willing to waste our lives
Disillusioned, I may never find a sense of home

Take me anywhere, wherever you're going
Take me anywhere, 'cause nobody wants me here
Take me anywhere, wherever you're going
Take me anywhere, 'cause nobody wants me here, here, here

Robots are rising while the rest of us keep writhing
We're just inferior after all
With the lights out, inspiration, we're a tired nation
Faulty, I don't want a sense of home

Take me anywhere, wherever you're going
Take me anywhere, 'cause nobody wants me here
Take me anywhere, wherever you're going
Take me anywhere, 'cause nobody wants me here, here, here

Take me anywhere, wherever you're going
Take me anywhere, 'cause nobody wants me here
Take me anywhere, wherever you're going
Take me anywhere, 'cause nobody wants me here

Take me anywhere, take me anywhere
Take me anywhere, 'cause nobody wants me here
Take me anywhere, take me anywhere
Take me anywhere, 'cause nobody wants me here, here, here
