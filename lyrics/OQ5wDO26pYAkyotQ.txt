Croos my heart and hope to die
You just put it all to shame
Now I'm taking back my life
So I'm giving back the pain

I'm giving back the pain
Takes a tragedy for us to speak
Bound hands crushed under the weight of the worlds feet
Visualized, end of times broadcasted lies
Say a player that I make it tonight

Selling you a broken dream
But in reality there's blood on the streets
I'll tell you what it means to me
So point the gun at me and pull the trigger

Croos my heart and hope to die
You just put it all to shame
Now I'm taking back my life
So I'm giving back the pain

You knew I'd fall
I saw right through it all
Croos my heart and hope to die
I'm giving back the pain
I'm giving back the pain

Another day goes by
Price tag on the loved ones that we stand by
Call to arms, who's in charge?
Do you realize?
Say a prayer that I make in through this so called life

Look at what you've done to me
I can see you're hiding fear in your eyes
I'll make you a memory
So take the pain you gave me and say goodbye

Croos my heart and hope to die
You just put it all to shame
Now I'm taking back my life
So I'm giving back the pain

You knew I'd fall
I saw right through it all
Croos my heart and hope to die
I'm giving back the pain

I've become undeniable, I'll see you at your burial
I've become undeniable

I'm giving back the pain
So come and get it
So come and get me
Yeah, I'm ready motherfucker

I've become undeniable, I'll see you at your burial
I've become undeniable, I'll see you at your burial

Croos my heart and hope to die
You just put it all to shame
Now I'm taking back my life
So I'm giving back the pain

You knew I'd fall
I saw right through it all
Croos my heart and hope to die
I'm giving back the pain
I'm giving back the pain

So come and get it
