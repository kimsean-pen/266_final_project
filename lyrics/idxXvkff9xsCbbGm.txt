You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'

Sister girl, I know you don't understand
But you're goin' have to understand, he's my man now
What you had is gone, Our thing it's sweet
Our thing it's stronger than any lie you can tell on me

He knows my heart and that's the part
Your roots are dug up so you might as well give up
I see your intentions, can't handle the truth
He let you go a long time ago now it's time to turn him loose

You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'

Suga honey girl, fly, fly away
I been a lady up 'til now don't know how much more I can take
Queens shouldn't swing if you know what I mean
But I'm 'bout to take my earrings off, get me some vasaline

I'm 'bout to go off in your face girl, you betta chill
You betta back down before you get smacked down, you betta chill
I'm 'bout to go off in your face girl, you betta chill
You betta back down before you get smacked down, you betta chill

You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'

Everything was beautiful between me and him
And here come you with your big mouth, talkin' about me
Tellin' him that you seen me up 24th street
With them other cats but you know that's a lie

You keep lying to my man, girlfriend
I'm go take you out in the middle of the street and whoop yo tail
All this worth 599 or something like that

You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
(You betta back down before you get smacked down, you betta chill)
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
(You betta back down before you get smacked down, you betta chill)

You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
(You betta back down before you get smacked down, you betta chill)
You're gettin' in the way of what I'm feelin'
(You betta back down before you get smacked down, you betta chill)
