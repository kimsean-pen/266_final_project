Can I make it here, I'm over it
I've been feeling weird, get over it
Can I wind up free, got over it
Is there more to see, gone over it

What else should I do
If I run around for you
Every night I'm spoken to
Keep it comin', more to do

You stayed lost so long, got over it
I'll ponder later on, go over it
Can't escape the task, not over it
Waitin' for you to ask, I'm over it

And over it, it's you
Haven't figured out it's true
How to reach out when I do
Not so easy to get through

I've been on the fence
Now it's makin' sense, I see
Sometimes I over think
And I feel my heart sink
I need to believe

I got lost in thought, I'm over it
All I almost lost, not over it
I got things to get, get over it
Hasn't happened yet, I'm over it

Now it's time to do
All the things you say are true
I'll get over, I need to
When I needed, you came through
Can I run right into you
Gettin' lost is nothin' new
I need everything, it's true
A commitment overdo

You're not gonna go
That I should've known, it's you
