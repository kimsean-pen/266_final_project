Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came

You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say i love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer

I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call
I hear harps
And angels sing

You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life
Without you

I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if i stop
Then tell me just what
Will I do
'cause I just can't stop loving you

At night when the
Stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true

When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you

You know how i feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying "I do"
"I do"
This thing can't go wrong
This feeling's so strong
Well, my life ain't
Worth living
If i can't be with you

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me, just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you

We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, hey
Farewell To sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always

I just can't stop loving you
No, baby
Oh!
I just can't stop loving you
If I can't stop!
And if I stop
Oh! Oh! Oh, Oh
What will I do? Uh . . .Ooh . . .
(then tell me, just what will I do)
I just can't stop loving you
I do Girl!
I just can't stop loving you
You know I do
And if I stop
Then tell me, just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you...
