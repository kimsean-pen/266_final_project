There's nobody quite like me
I mind my business head towards the sea
I don't enjoy the ocean, so I'll just stay afloat
I'll mind my business and ignore the waves
Why is this how you behave?
You got some seaweed around your leg
Don't let it hold you back another day
Cause stress, it won't fix nothing
And you can't predict the day
And if you aren't winning thats okay

Boy these boots won't last forever
Next year will be so much better
Let's exterminate these mites that munch your brain
If you're ever feeling down there's always someone around
To help you off you knees and pick you up
