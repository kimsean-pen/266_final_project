I lied to you
I never cried for you
Swear that I tried to
But I have better things to do
Now you're on the road
with your painful load
And the words I spoke
left your big heart broke

And though you still bother
because love is for the poor
So I left you knocking
Outside my front door
You knew what this was
I don't want you anymore
I warned you before
I warned you before

That I could've sworn that I told you I was mean

You were a sweet old thing
And I was lonely so I let you hold me
For a limited time
Only you see
You're nothing to me

'Cause I'll always be
A bad bad seed
And though you still bother
because love is for the poor
I left you knocking outside my front door
You knew what this was
I don't want you anymore
I warned you before

I warned you before
Well I could've sworn that I told you I was mean
dum di dah

I'm just a mean ol' thing'
dum di dah dum dum
Ain't no use to bother
Because love is for the poor
So cut out your knockin'
'Cause I will never come, I will never come to the door
You knew just what this was
And I don't want you forevermore
I warned you before, hey baby

I warned you before, oh honey
Well I could've sworn
I told you I was mean
dum di dah dum dum
I'm just a mean ol' thing'
dum di dah dum dum
