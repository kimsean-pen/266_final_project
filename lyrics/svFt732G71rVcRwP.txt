Every word's a new regret if you say it right, right?
Every wound can be forgotten in the right light
Oh nostalgia, I don't need you anymore
'Cause the Salad Days are over and the meat is at my door
'Cause they might, try to tell you how you can live your life
But don't, don't forget it's your right,
to do whatever you like, you like, you like, you like
'Cause they might, try to tell you how you can live your life
But don't,
don't forget it's your right, to do whatever you like, you like
'Cause you could be your own spotlight, e-o, e-o
You could be your own spotlight, e-o, e-o
You could be your own spotlight,
you could be the star, you can shine so bright, e-o, e-o

Depression is a little bit like happy hour, right?

It's always gotta be happening somewhere on any given night
Oh nostalgia, I don't need you anymore
I just hope my perfect stranger that my kids look more like yours
'Cause they might, try to tell you how you can live your life
But don't,
don't forget it's your right, to do whatever you like, you like
'Cause you could be your own spotlight, e-o, e-o
You could be your own spotlight, e-o, e-o
You could be your own spotlight,
you could be the star, you can shine so bright, e-o, e-o
You could be your own spotlight, e-o, e-o
You could be your own spotlight, e-o, e-o
You could be your own spotlight,
you could be the star, you can shine so bright, e-o, e-o
'Cause I had a little bit of bad luck
Oh, when will this crumbling world stops
A little sweetness keeps just out of reach
'Cause compassion is something that
they just don't, just don't teach, teach
'Cause you could be your own spot light, e-o, e-o
You could be your own spotlight, e-o, e-o
You could be your own spotlight,
you could be the star, you can shine so bright, e-o, e-o

You could be your own spotlight, e-o, e-o
