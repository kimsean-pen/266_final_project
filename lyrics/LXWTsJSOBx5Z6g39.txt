i walk back to the place where i lost it
and these places remain all the same
and you tell me, "anger is not good for the body."
and you say i changed, but who is to blame?
oh, i will hate you until i feel still
oh, i will embrace the way i still say the same
and you took a hard squeeze at the soft spots on my body
and these spots will remain touched in vain
oh, i will apologize until i am ill
oh, i will take the blame, and you will stay the same
