Dark resurrection
This is me
Trapped inside my own mouth
Taking care of my house
Haven't seen you bare in some time but that's on me

In the darkest of ways I go to sleep
Wrapped in a death bag
Alone in a death bed
With no one to talk to
Still trapped in my own head
All I want from her is just one thing

I know, I know the two of us have had a hard
time speaking when there's something to be said
We know
We know the two of us are in a strange way
In a strange place

How do we make our love grow? I forget
Tell me what you need from me to reconnect

I can't, I can't read a green light
It's so hard to make out when my head isn't on right
I can't hold you but I have to
My life in a cube
Projections of you
I can't tell you that it's alright
In blank conversation
Depresssed on a weeknight
I can't bring myself around you
In shadows and doom
I'm thinking of you

And how I can connect you back to me...
My hand on her shoulder
How can I get through to her
I try to bring it up but I can't speak

And so I'm so afraid to love you
And my heart hurts always
And I want you all the time
Alone...
To think that I'm alone is like my worst fear
I need you right here

How do we make our love grow
I forget
Haven't I laid bare my intentions yet
