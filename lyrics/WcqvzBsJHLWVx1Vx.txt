Yeah, this song is dedicated
(This is Good Charlotte)
To every kid who ever got picked last in gym class
(You know what I'm saying, this is for you)
To every kid who never had a date to no school dance
(This is for you)
To every one who's ever been called a freak
(You know what I'm saying)
This is for you
Here we, here we gooo

Yeah, uh
What, come on
Yeah, what,
Come on, come on, come on
Here we go

Oh oh oh oh oh (come on)
Oh oh oh oh oh (let's do this)
Here we go

Like the time in school when we got free lunch
And the cool kids beat us up (Reduced lunch)
And the rich kids had convertibles
And we had to ride the bus (55)
Like the time we made the baseball team
But they still laughed at us (You still suck)
Like the time that girl broke up with me
'Cause I wasn't cool enough
Trick

Things
Things
Here we go

The little things, little things
They always hang around
The little things, little things
They try to break me down
The little things, little things
They just won't go away
The little things, little things
Made me who I am today
Go

You wanna hate me now
But I won't stop now
'Cause I can't stop now

Yeah, what
Come on, what
Yeah, what
Come on, come on
Here we go

Like the time mom went to the institute
'Cause she was breaking down (I just can't take it)
Like the car we had that wouldn't start
We had to walk to get around (Can I get a ride?)
And that same year on Christmas Eve
Dad went to the store (Uh, I'll see you guys later)
We checked his room his things were gone
We didn't see him no more
Dich

Things
Things
Here we go

The little things, little things
They always hang around
The little things, little things
They try to break me down
The little things, little things
They just won't go away
The little things, little things
Make me who I am today
Go

You wanna hate me now
But I won't stop now
'Cause I can't stop now

What, what, what
Here we gooo (Here we go, go, go)

Little things
Little things
Little things
Little things
Little things
Little things
Little things
Little things
Little things
Little things
Little things
Little things
Little things
Little things
Little things
Here we go

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

And it always seems those little things
They take the biggest part of me

Break down
I'm breaking down
I'm breaking down
