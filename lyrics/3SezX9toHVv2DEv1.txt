Another day is gone
Some other time maybe I'd come out
And step into the sun
A little time ago
I didn't wanna see us falling out
But everything has gone

I wish I could, sometimes I wish I would
Always your way
You want it all, I did everything I could
Always your way

I'm talking to the walls
I guess it seems that all the wait is gone
But everything is numb
And in my broken jar
All the remains are watered down
And I'm starting to drown

I wish I could, sometimes I wish I would
Always your way
You want it all, I did everything I could
Always your way

I wish I could, sometimes I wish I would
Always your way
You want it all, I did everything I could
Always your way

Always your way
Always your way
Always your way
Always
