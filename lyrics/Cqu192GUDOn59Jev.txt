A destination to agree
You can't help pushing me to the other way
A revolution on a team that was on form
I never thought I was a part of it

The detonation of
The satisfaction
When you ring my bell and I wanna be ready for your smile
I need you, please, my baby

My veneration set you free
You're kinda pushing me to the other way
A revolution on a team that wasn't yours
I never thought you would replace me with it

The detonation of
The satisfaction
When you ring my bell and I wanna be ready for your smile
I need you, please, my baby, please

The satisfaction of
The imitation
When you ring my bell and I wanna be ready for your hell
I need you, please, my baby, please

The satisfaction of
The innovation
When you ring my bell and I wanna be ready for your hell
I need you, please, my baby, please
