In reverse mode
Cause we are the fighters
Just fighting for our rights
Stand up, join us, modern crusaders alive
We have the power

We're not submissive, we're not aggressive
But they think
Stand up, join us, modern crusaders alive
We have the power
. Sors salutis
et virtutis
michi nunc contraria

Hac in hora
sine nora
cordum pulsum tangite
quod per sortem
sternit fortem
mecum omnes plangite

(Translation:
Fate, in health
and virtue,
is against me

So at this hour
without delay
pluck the vibrating strings;
since Fate
strikes down the strong man,
everyone weep with me!
