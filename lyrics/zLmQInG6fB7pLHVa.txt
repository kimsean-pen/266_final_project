It's 11: 11 and the world is windin' down
Thinkin' damn, I could use a shooting star right now
I wish I was perfect enough for you, I wish I was flawless, just like you
I wish I was sane enough, but I'm just crazy, baby

Crazy over you
Crazy over you
Can you play me? Will you save me?
Lookin' at you makes me weak
Could you help me? Would you tell me?
You don't want nobody else but me
I wish you were (already mine, already mine)
I wish you were (already mine, already mine)
Just gotta hear you one time
Just gotta hear you one time
I wish you were, already mine

Now it's 11 past 12, I keep lookin' at my caller ID
But you ain't even got my number, why the hell would you be callin' me?
I wish you were closer, closer to me, and if I would grow, can be all I need
Maybe you noticed, and seen me, call me crazy, baby

Crazy over you
Crazy over you
Can you play me? Will you save me?
Lookin' at you makes me weak
Could you help me? Would you tell me?
You don't want nobody else but me
I wish you were (already mine, already mine)
I wish you were (already mine, already mine)
Just gotta hear you one time
Just gotta hear you one time
I wish you were, already mine

It's 11: 11 and the world is windin' down
