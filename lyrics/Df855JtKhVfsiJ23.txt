Worry, Worry, Worry, love is passing me by
()
Worry, Worry, Worry, love is passing me by
Worry, Worry, Worry, i'm so painfully shy
Oh, the guys get all the kisses
Why am I the one who misses
Worry, Worry, Worry,
Woe always me
Baby, Baby, Baby, i'm a fool about love
Maybe, Maybe, I should go to school about love
When it comes to gettin' chummy
I'll admit i'm quite a dummy
Worry, Worry, Worry
Why always me
I've found out that i'm the worrying kind
I go worrying right along
Life is fine, but with a worrying mind
So many things can go wrong
Worry, Worry, Worry, should i hold her so tight
Worry, Worry, Worry, am I kissing her right
She said: "Joe, it's you I'll marry."
"I'm not Joe, my name is Harry."
Worry, Worry, Worry
Why always me
