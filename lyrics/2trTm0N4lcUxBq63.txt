I would send out for assistance
But there's someone on the signal wire
And the corporation logo
Is flashing on and off in the sky
They're putting all your names
In the forbidden book
I know what they're doing
But I don't want to look
You think they're so dumb, you think they're so funny
Wait until they've got you running
To the night rally, night rally, night rally
Everybody's singing with their hand on their heart
About deeds done in the darkest hours
That's just the sort of catchy little melody
To get you singing in the showers
Oh, I know that I'm ungrateful, I've got it lyin' on a plate
And I'm not buying my share of souvenirs
You can stand to attention, you can pray to your uncle
Only get that chicken out of here
Everyone gets armbands and 3-D glasses
Some are in the back room
And they're taking those night classes
You think they're so dumb, you think they're so funny
Wait until they've got you running
To the night rally, night rally, night rally, night rally
Night rally, night rally, night rally, night rally
Night rally, night rally, night rally, night rally
Night rally, night rally, night rally, night rally
Night rally, night rally, night rally, night rally
