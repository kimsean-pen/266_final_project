People always say, get out of your head
Do anything do that you want
Pretty soon you'll be dead
Then I thought of
I've been thinking what you want

I should come down now
Get out of my head
Yeah I should come down now
And get out of my head

She said darling come home now
Cause you've been away too long
I said hey now, I've been right here
Should have let you know I know

People always say, don't be so blind
You're gonna hurt somebody
Don't kill no one
And I guess they're right
I should just realize
Cause if I'm not careful
I might hurt someone

Yeah, if I'm not careful
I might hurt someone
She said darling come home now
Cause you've been away too long
I said hey now, I've been right here
Somehow I know I know
