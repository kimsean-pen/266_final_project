I'm not a hero's story
I'm not the traitor's lie
I'm not every thing they said
I'm not here to save you
I'm not your confessor
My sins alone could wake the dead

But do you understand?
Nothing can make it better
Nothing can make it go away
And do you understand
That we are lost to ruin
And this will be our end of day-ay-ays?

And when the sun fell down
And when the moon failed to rise
And when the world came apart
Where were you? Were you with me?
And when my light burns out
And when my fire is cold
And when my breath is the wind
Where will you be, dear God?

I have no forgiveness
I have a heart of stone
I am a lesson born of greed
I am torn and twisted
I am a broken bone
I am what you've made of me

But do you understand
That none of this will matter?
Nothing can take your pain away
And do you understand
That everything is shattered
And so the whole world ends today-ay-ay?

And when the sun fell down
And when the moon failed to rise
And when the world came apart
Where were you? Were you with me?
And when my light burns out
And when my fire is cold
And when my breath is the wind
Where will you be, dear God?

And when the sun fell down
And when the moon failed to rise
And when the world came apart
Where were you? Were you with me?
And when my light burns out
And when my fire is cold
And when my breath is the wind
I will find you, dear God
