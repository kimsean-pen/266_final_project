Memories sharp as daggers
Pierce into the flesh of today
Suicide of love took away all that matters
And buried the remains in an unmarked grave in your heart

With the venomous kiss you gave me
I'm killing loneliness
(Killing loneliness)
With the warmth of your arms you saved me
Oh, I'm killing loneliness with you
The killing loneliness

That turned my heart into a tomb
I'm killing loneliness
Nailed to a cross together as solitude begs us to stay
We disappear in the lie forever
And denounce the power of death over our souls

And secret words are said to start a war
With the venomous kiss you gave me
I'm killing loneliness
(Killing loneliness)
With the warmth of your arms you saved me
Oh, I'm killing loneliness with you

The killing loneliness

That turned my heart into a tomb
I'm killing loneliness
(Killing loneliness)
I'm killing loneliness
With the venomous kiss you gave me
I'm killing loneliness

(Killing loneliness)
With the warmth of your arms you saved me
Oh, I'm killing loneliness with you
The killing loneliness

That turned my heart into a tomb
I'm killing loneliness
I'm killing loneliness with you
I'm killing loneliness with you
Killing loneliness with you
Killing loneliness with you
Killing loneliness
Killing loneliness
