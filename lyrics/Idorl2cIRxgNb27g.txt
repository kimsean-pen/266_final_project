Let me be the one
Who calls you baby all the time
Surely you can take some comfort
Knowing that you're mine

Just hold me tight, lay by my side
And let me be the one who
Calls you baby all the time

I found my place in the world
Could stare at your face
For the rest of my days

Now I can breathe
Turn my insides out and smother me
Warm and alive, I'm all over you
Would you smother me?

Let me be the one who
Never leaves you all alone
I hold my breath and lose the feeling
That I'm on my own
(Leaves me all alone)

Hold me too tight, stay by my side
And let me be the one
Who calls you baby all the time
(All the time)

I found my place in the world
Could stare at your face
For the rest of my days

Now I can breathe
Turn my insides out and smother me
Warm and alive, I'm all over you
Would you smother me?
Smother me, smother me

When I'm alone, time goes so slow
I need you here with me
And how my mistakes
Have made your heart break
Still need you here with me
So baby, I'm, baby, I'm here

Now I can breathe, turn my insides out
And smother me
(Smother me)
Warm and alive, I'm all over you
Would you smother me?
(Let me be alone)

Now I can breathe, turn my insides out
And smother me
(Smother me)
Warm and alive, I'm all over you
Would you smother me?
Smother me, smother me
Let me be the one who
Calls you baby all the time
Let me be the one who
Calls you baby all the time
Let me be the one who
Calls you baby
The one who calls you baby
