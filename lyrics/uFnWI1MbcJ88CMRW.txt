I'm haunted
And unwanted
And talked down to
What'd I do
And if you have a kiss for me, and only me, I'll take it
If you have a kiss
I'm haunted
And unwanted
And talked down to
What'd I do
And if you have a kiss for me, and only me, I'll take it
If you have a kiss
Get wasted
And lose best friends
And lie down with
The wrong business
And if you have a kiss for me, and only me, I'll take it
If you have a kiss
