Take my problems take me anyplace
Take my my mind as well
I been trying long, got nothing left
It's down to you as you can tell
And it bothers me, all of the while
And I needed more than had time

This is all I came to do
This is all I came to do
This is all I came to do
This is all I came to do

I need much more than I had before
Give me my my mind as well
I been waiting here got nothing drawn
I been lonely you can tell
And I wanted to end the day
And I wanted love to get in the way
I pray I get it

This is all I came to do
This is all I came to do
This is all I came to do
This is all I came to do

Hate to say it but you told me so
I tricked my my mind its true
And I thought hard about all I could be
Please just tell me what to do

This is all I came to do
This is all I came to do
This is all I came to do
This is all I came to do

This is all I came to do
This is all I came to do
This is all I came to do
This is all I came to do
