From evening to morning
and morning to evening
I wanna drink
something stronger than a man
From evening to morning
and morning to evening
I wanna drink
cause that's what I am
Beer, beer
I want beer
from beer I get really drunk
Beer, beer
I need more beer
so much I pass out
Beer, beer
I want beer
from beer I get really drunk
Beer, beer
I need more beer
so much I pass out
For beer I'm working
for beer I'm fighting
for beer I'll do
whatever I have to
when drunk I'm talking
when drunk I'm joking
when drunk I can be as I've
always wanted to be
Beer, beer
I want beer
from beer I get really drunk
Beer, beer
I need more beer
so much I pass out
Beer, beer
I want beer
from beer I get really drunk
Beer, beer
I need more beer
so much I pass out
