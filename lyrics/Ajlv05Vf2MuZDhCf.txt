It's a great big world
There's a million other guys
I feel so lucky when I look
In those green eyes

Is it the sun
That makes them so green?
Those are the prettiest eyes
I have ever seen

Green eyes...

What makes them sparkle?
What makes them shine?
What makes those eyes of yours
Look into mine?

Green eyes...
