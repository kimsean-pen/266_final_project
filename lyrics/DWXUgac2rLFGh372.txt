Could have come through
Anytime
Cold lonely
Puritan
What are you
Fighting for?
It's not my
Security

It's just an old war
Not even a cold war
Don't say it in Russian
Don't say it in German
Say it in broken English
Say it in broken English

Lose your father
Your husband
Your mother
Your children
What are you
Dying for?
It's not my
Reality

It's just an old war
Not even a cold war
Don't say it in Russian
Don't say it in German
Say it in broken English
Say it in broken English

What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting for?
