What is the name that you would like to be
I'll never know just why you've come to me
I've never known this sort of sorcery
I wonder when or if you'll tire of me

Can't escape the way you're holding me
Don't believe that I'll want you to leave

You carried me back with you to who knows where
You told me things that I cannot unhear
You showed me things and now I want them near
I want to know just what you're doing here

Can't escape that I'm tied to your head
What'd you do with all those words you said
Can't you see the lashes fluttering

Can't escape the way you're holding on
Don't believe that I will want you gone
Can't you see the lashes fluttering
Lust disguised in curtsied crinoline
