You sweep across the heavens, an extinction grade event
And carve your name upon the gates where angels fear to tread
All hail my
You shine like blood and diamonds, you sing like breaking glass
You drag them out into the street and turn their names to ash
All hail my

You hum like quiet lightning in the eye of a typhoon
A bird of illest omen crowing all impending doom
All hail my
The whisper of unnerving truth when saner minds depart
You rise like Christ the Savior, you burn as Joan of Arc
All hail my
You bring the axe upon them with devastating grace
And on their heads, forever lay a curse upon their fate
All hail my
My spirit on unhinging force, my avalanche untamed
Bearing down relentlessly on all who dare remain
All hail my

All hail my
My unnatural disaster
All hail my
My kaleidoscopic gloom
All hail my
My karmic equalizer
All hail my
My cemetery bloom
