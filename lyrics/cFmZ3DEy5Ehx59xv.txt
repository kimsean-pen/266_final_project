I was sitting in a field of pine trees coaxing the words from the earth and the dirt
I sought a muse but the words just wouldn't come
It's been a while since I saw you at New Year
holding your breath, your eyes upon the second hand
the way you looked is still vivid to me You're something out of a dream
messing with my head
I've been looking for you
are ya hiding?
cos I like the way you're calling to me
your spell upon me
you're something out of a dream
and I like it, though I fight it
It took a while for the medicine to sink in blow out the fog and remove all the cobwebs
now I'm clear I can hear myself think straight
I'm on the road with my clothes in a rucksack
over my shoulder
following the whispers
people ask me where I'm going in such haste
and I say
My girl's a switchblade
a bright light on the cityscape
wherever she goes I'm gonna chase You're something out of a dream
messing with my head
I've been looking for you are ya hiding? cos I like the way you're calling to me
your spell upon me
you're something out of a dream
and I like it, though I fight it
