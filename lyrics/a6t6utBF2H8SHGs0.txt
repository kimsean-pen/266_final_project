Open your mouth wide
A universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It's what keeps me alive
So why does it still hurt?
Don't blow your mind with whys

I'm moving out of orbit
(Turning in somersaults)
Turning in somersaults
(A giant turtle's eyes)
A giant turtle's eyes
(As jellyfish float by)
As jellyfish float by
