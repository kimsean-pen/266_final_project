And only when the sun was down
Yeah only when the world was quiet
Could I belong to you
Forgot about reality
You got me high on poetry
So deep, it can be real

I can't hold back
I'm shouting out in the night
I'm a ghost surviving the light
I can't breathe when you're out of sight, I

I am torn, I am torn
Build me up, build me up
Dead alive, dead alive
'Cause you broke me into pieces
You broke me into pieces

I am torn, I am torn
Build me up, build me up
Dead alive, dead alive
'Cause you broke me into pieces
You broke me into pieces

I'm frozen in the summer heat
I'm dancing I can't hear the beat
Baby I
I'm incomplete

I can't hold back
I'm shouting out in the night
I'm a ghost surviving the light
I can't breathe when you're out of sight, I

I am torn, I am torn
Build me up, build me up
Dead alive, dead alive
'Cause you broke me into pieces
Your broke me into pieces

I am torn, I am torn
Build me up, build me up
Dead alive, dead alive
'Cause you broke me into pieces
You broke me into pieces

When the walls came down
Did you hear the sound?
Of a beating heart
Laying on the ground

There's a hole in me
Hope one day you'll see
There's a beating heart
And it's ripped apart

I am torn
'Cause you broke me into pieces
You broke me into pieces
'Cause you broke me into pieces
You broke me into pieces
