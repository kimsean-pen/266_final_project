The lightning
On your face
You stole
The world
From me
Your voice
Is in my lungs
You are right
Where I belong
But now your gone
Gone
Night after night
I close my eyes
And think of you
I'm not waking up
Not in love with you

Striking a match
To photographs
I lay in the ashes
Of you
In a spiders web
Between the stars
You are right
Where you belong
Your coming home

Night after night
I close my eyes
And think of you
I'm not waking up
Not in love
With you
We say goodbye
Told a lie
You know
The truth
I'm not waking up
Not in love
With you
