You're my secret weapon
My sexy piece of heaven
Girl, you make me better
I swear we'll be together
You're my secret weapon
My sexy piece of heaven
Girl, you make me better
I swear we'll be together

I'm getting impatient
Almost every other conversation's just a waste of time
Did I give into temptation?
A master of manipulation but you'll never mind

It's true, you're dead to me when the night is done
It's a love casualty, look what we've become

You're my secret weapon
My sexy piece of heaven
Girl, you make me better
I swear we'll be together
You're my secret weapon
My sexy piece of heaven
Girl, you make me better
I swear we'll be together

Two can keep a secret
But you know that's only true when one of them is dead
And I won't, won't be a victim
It's a crime, we've dug a grave that we are sleeping in

And I know it's dangerous to mix love and lust
It's cold inside your arms when the morning comes

You're my secret weapon
My sexy piece of heaven
Girl, you make me better
I swear we'll be together
You're my secret weapon
My sexy piece of heaven
Girl, you make me better
I swear we'll be together

You're my secret
Don't you make this difficult
You're my secret
Cause you know that I want more
You're my secret
We'll just keep it on the low
You're my secret, you're my secret, you're my secret
You're my secret
Just keep it on the low
You're my secret
We can do no wrong
You're my secret
I'mma love you all night long

Touch it, touch it, touch it, touch it
Touch it, touch it, touch it, touch it
