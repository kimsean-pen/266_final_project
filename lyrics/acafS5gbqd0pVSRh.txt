Ooooooooo
Loving loving what you do
Ooooooooo
Loving loving what you do
Uuuuuu aaaaa, loving loving what you do
Uuuuuu aaaaa, loving loving what you do

I could do this all day
Long as you by my side
We don't care what they say
Everything will be alright
Always up never down
Every time you around
Whenever you say my name
Oh I love the way it sound
I've been knowing you so long
And I never question you
You ain't never did me wrong
Always know what to do
Pick me up when I'm down
All I need is you around
Don't you love the way that that sounds, baby?

Uuuuuu aaaaa, loving loving what you do
Uuuuuu aaaaa, loving loving what you do
Uuuuuu aaaaa, loving loving what you do
Uuuuuu aaaaa, loving loving what you do

Call me when you're parked outside
I'll come running up to you
Open the door to your ride
Doing things that gentleman do
Suit and tie maybe blue
No one do what my baby do
A dozen roses just for me
Oh I'm lucky as can be
He notice all little things
Checking up every day
Oh I'm loving that you care
When you look at me that way

Pulling up valet
Court side, Laker game
It's like every day is my birthday yeah

Uuuuuu aaaaa, loving loving what you do
Uuuuuu aaaaa, loving loving what you do
Uuuuuu aaaaa, loving loving what you do
Uuuuuu aaaaa, loving loving what you do

Two peas in a pod
Got the key to my lock
You're the beat to my heart
You're the road on my rock
All I have to say
Is that I'm loving I'm loving
I'm loving, I'm loving you
Uuuuuu aaaaa, loving loving what you do
Uuuuuu aaaaa, loving loving what you do
Uuuuuu aaaaa, loving loving what you do
Uuuuuu aaaaa, loving loving what you do
Loving loving what you do
Loving loving what you do
