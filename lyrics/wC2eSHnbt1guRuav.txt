[I hear you... but I'm not afraid of you]
[I'm not afraid of you]

Father, where's my gun?
Now that the war has begun
Oh let me go it alone
I need no one
I said I need no one

But oh God now here it comes and it's too dark to aim this gun
Clicking now faster, faster, faster
once again I'm on the run

And I hear you say,
"Oh my stubborn son, don't you just say you need no one?
But don't you see danger, danger, danger, headed to oblivion?"

Follow the hunt, far as I could
Through a dozen weathers
Petrified wood
And I took one shot, in the dark
And fired the bullet, silver to heart

And oh God now here it comes and it's too dark to aim this gun
Now faster, faster, faster
Once again I'm on the run

And I hear you say,
"Oh my stubborn son, I know that you said you need no one
But don't you see danger, danger, danger, headed to oblivion?"
Oblivion, oblivion, oblivion, oblivion, oblivion, oblivion...

[Wait a second... have you come so far, for it to end like this?]

no

[This is the challenge... I dare you, to take a hold of that darkness from deep down within you]

It's dark

[Get back up, what are you so afraid of?]

Wait

[Get back up!]

Okay

Show your face, face to me
Show you face, face to me
Be you my friend...
Or enemy?
Show your face
Face to me
I do not fear oblivion
I do not fear oblivion
Said I do not fear oblivion
Oblivion, oblivion, oblivion...

Father, where is my gun?
I need no one
And I need no one
So let me go now.
