Fire burns through darkness
Unseen unveiled
Come bear to witness
Belief shaken to the core
Upon the sight of the other shore

Heaven speaks in riddles
Prophets speak in tongues
The dead speak in silence
Love smiles in surrender

Red eyes in desperation
A world we cannot escape
Clutching hate like a weapon
Blood in our hands
Expound the gospel

Belief shaken to the core
Upon the sight of the other shore
