When a man needs a woman? s love so much
It can be a beautiful love story
But not all love is beautiful
This is the strangest music to make love to

Passion filled rendezvous
Heart wrenching goodbyes
A memory of love
This is the way I always wanted it to feel like

It won? t be not as long
As long as you insisted on living in the past
'Cause that? s pain
I don? t care who you are

It takes so many things to make love last
But most of all it takes respect
And I can? t live with a man I don? t respect
No wonder you're upset

She? s lovely, he? s quite the man about town
There? s one song in particular he used in his, umm
Campaign, the phone bill is going to be enormous, you know
Everyone has a summer they remember
