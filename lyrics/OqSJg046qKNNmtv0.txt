I rushed right in
Just like a fool
So struck down by you
I didn't know what to do

I started on
Breaking my own heart
Breaking my own heart
Breaking my own heart
Yeah

I started on
Breaking my own heart
Breaking my own heart

Yeah I was frozen
By the pain
I tried
To reach out to you
But I felt so ashamed

So, I kept on
Breaking my own heart
Breaking my own heart
Breaking my own heart

I kept on
Breaking my own heart
Breaking my own heart

Save me
Somebody save me
From this misery
Love is killing me
Please save me

I need saving
Won't somebody save me
From this misery
Love is killing me
Ooo, save me

I hung on
To every word you say
In search of a sign boy
You felt the same way

But it was only me
Breaking my own heart
Breaking my own heart
Breaking my own heart

If I keep on
Breaking my own heart
Breaking my own heart

Save me
Won't somebody save me
From this misery
Love is killing me
Save me

I need saving
Won't somebody save me
From this misery
Love is killing me
Ooo, save me

Ooh Save
I said "Save me"
From this misery
Love is killing me
Please save me
