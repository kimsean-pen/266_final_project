When the power chords come crashing down
Go tearing through my senses
It's for the strong and for the weak
In light of dark dimensions

It stimulates regenerates it's therapeutic healing
It lifts our feet up off the ground and blasts us through the ceiling
Between the eyes I hear you screaming
And it electrifies your inner feelings

Hot shock waves charge the air all the heads are banging
Fists pumping everywhere guitars are cracking

Heavy metal, heavy metal
(What do you want?)
Heavy metal, heavy metal
(What do you want?)

Ten thousand lights come blazing down with razor sharp precision
The speakers pour out molten steel the beat gives double vision
An amour plated raging beast that's born of steel and leather
It will survive against all odds stampeding on forever

Between the eyes I hear you screaming
And it electrifies your inner feelings

Hot shock waves charge the air all heads are banging
Fists pumping everywhere guitars are cracking

Heavy metal, heavy metal
(What do you want?)
Heavy metal, heavy metal
(What do you want?)

Heavy metal, heavy metal
(What do you want?)

Hot shock waves charge the air all heads are banging
Fists pumping everywhere guitars are cracking

Heavy metal, heavy metal
(What do you want?)
Heavy metal, heavy metal
(What do you want?)
(We want)
Heavy metal, heavy metal
(What do you want?)
Heavy metal, heavy metal
(What do you want?)
(We want)
Heavy metal, heavy metal
(What do you want?)
Heavy metal, heavy metal
(What do you want?)
(We want)
Heavy metal, heavy metal
(What do you want?)
