I spit in your face, preachers and leaders
Spewing false dogma to their believers
A nation of wolves haunting the sheep
Their fangs in your flesh
So painful and deep

Despise your heroes
Living a lie
Despicable heroes
Fooling the blind

Puppets on strings, face on the ground
Nothing more than a shallow farce
Consume the young, thoughtless ones
Eat their brain, leave them blind
And then destroy
Destroy

I spit in the face of your preachers and leaders
Spewing false dogma to their believers
A nation of fools, nothing but sheep
Their fangs in your flesh, so painful and deep

Despise your heroes
Living a lie
Despicable heroes
Fooling the blind
Open your mind
