How could I be so dumb
I wanted to believe someone
How could I be so dumb
I wanted to believe someone
I shouldn't have

Made the mistake of opening my mouth
I thought you'd understand but I guess that thinking doesn't count
Act all concerned - well, sucks for me man
Can't wait to see where you will be when it finally hits the fan

You tell me I shouldn't want to die
But can't give me one good reason why!

Oh, give it up and get out of my way
Don't bother patronizing me just 'cause you've got nothing to say
I've taken what you've told me, I was ready to apply
"liars can't be trusted" man, but you're the one who lied

You tell me I shouldn't want to die
But can't give me one good reason why!

One time my spine controlled by your
Small mind so many reasons for what
You've justified (don't kill yourself)

How could I be so dumb
I wanted to believe someone
How could I be so dumb
I wanted to believe someone

You tell me I shouldn't want to die
But can't give me one good reason why!

You tell me I shouldn't want to die
But can't give (You cant give me)

You can't give me...
You can't give me...
You can't give me...
Give me...
You can't give me...
(Good reason)
One good reason
(Give me a good reason)
One good reason
(Give me a good reason)
One good reason
(Give me. me...)
