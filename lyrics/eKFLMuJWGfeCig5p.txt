Exclaimations feel
Before you set to conceal
She loves the man you told
Did you sing me and fly in coach
Hey sister its unreal
The way I take it to the sky my row been
Could you show them the ten
To hear about heavens sins

Your highs taken to the sky
Yellow and zebras
Voice 1: Fly
Voice 2: Fall
Your skys taken to the flies
And next is found west
Feeling the best
Hey-la
Hey-la
Hey-la
