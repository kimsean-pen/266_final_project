You'd never know if you could doubt it,
i can't believe they're gone,
you don't even know what side your on,
don't want to joke or talk about,
now it's been far too long,
you don't even know what side your on x3

And I'll let you go,
whoaahoh

Your night is growing overcrowded,
you're out to prove me wrong,
you don't even know what side your on,
took all my life to run around it
and now we're so far gone
you don't even know what side your on

Hey now, hey now,
I'd have given all you see,
if you could turn around your dream and come back to me
hey now, hey now,
I'd have had to let you go,
chasing shadows but only catch an afterglow

Hey now, hey now,
I'd have given all you see,
if you could turn around your dream and come back to me
hey now, hey now,
I'd have had to let you go,
chasing shadows but only catch an afterglow
