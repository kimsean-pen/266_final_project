There's a storm coming up and I gotta prepare myself.
'Cause this feeling's getting stronger everyday.
Something's creeping inside everything is about to change.
Gotta face the fact that I can't walk away.

This is critical
I'm feeling helpless.
So hysterical, this can't be healthy.
I can't eat or sleep when you're not with me.

Baby, you're the air breath.
This is critical, yeah.
So stuck on you.
Used to have everything figured out
but it's different now.
When you came, you saw you conquered
my heart.
It's your laugh and your smile

wanna stay for a little while.
I don't wanna go
I just want you in my arms.
This is critical

I'm feeling helpless.
So hysterical, this can't be healthy.
I can't eat or sleep
when you're not with me.

Baby, you're the air breath.
This is critical, yeah.
So stuck on you.
Used to run and hide.
Used to bend our love.
But I can't escape this time.
Oh no.
This is critical

I'm feeling helpless.
So hysterical, this can't be healthy.
I can't eat or sleep
when you're not with me.

You're the air breath.
This is critical, yeah.
Baby it's so critical
it's so critical, yeah.
It's so critical
it's so critical, yeah
So stuck on you.
