It's killing me to be in this room
I've gotta get out, I've gotta get out soon
I'm hurting you with everything I do
It's too long, too long in this place

We're counting down only seconds now
I've gotta hang on, hang on to you
I'm staring at my cuticles
Too long, too long in this place

We have each other, you are my brother
Sitting here beside you I just wanna use you
We have each other, you are my brother
Sitting here beside you I just wanna use you

I'm hurting you with everything I do
I've gotta get out, I've gotta get out soon
It's killing me to be in this room
I don't belong, belong in this place

We have each other, you are my brother
Sitting here beside you I just wanna use you
We have each other, you are my brother
Sitting here beside you I just wanna use

We have each other, you are my brother
Sitting here beside you I just wanna use you
We have each other, you are my brother
Sitting here beside you I just wanna use you

We have each other, you are my brother
Sitting here beside you I just wanna use you
We have each other, you are my brother
Sitting here beside you I just wanna use you

Use you, I just wanna use you
Use you, I just wanna use you
