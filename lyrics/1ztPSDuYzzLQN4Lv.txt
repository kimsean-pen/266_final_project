Please wake up, it's so dark and cold
Please wake up, I feel so alone
And I feel so scared that you're going away
And I feel so scared

All I want is summer stories from before
Just like the day you tried to hide
Behind the churchyard wall

And fell asleep before I came
I found you in a chain of flowers
Sleeping like a marble girl
Sleeping in another world

I'll never tell you of all the different ways
You make me so afraid, yeah

Please wake up, it's so dark and cold
Please wake up, I feel so alone
And I feel so scared that you're going away
And I feel so scared that you're going away

I'll never tell you of all the different ways
All the different ways, you make me so afraid
