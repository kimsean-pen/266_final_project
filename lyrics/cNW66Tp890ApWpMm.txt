I call my brother yellin out
I fell in love and then fell out
And I don't know if I can take the hint
I let a stranger in my bed
And I pretended you were him
Cause I needed to feel wanted
I gotta
Oh I gotta find another way
Another way
I'm learnin to live
I'm tryna be better
I'm learnin to give
But I don't know if I'm a giver
I'm learnin to live
I'm tryna be better
I'm learnin to live
But I don't know if I'm a giver
I don't know if I'm a giver.
And every day's another shot
But all I do is fuck it up
Screaming cuz I've got it too good to cry...
I put the medicine inside my head
Apologize for all the things I said
Girl, it takes guts just to survive...
I gotta
Oh I gotta find another way
Another way.
I'm learnin to live
I'm tryna be better
I'm learnin to give
But I don't know if I'm a giver
I'm learnin to live
I'm tryna be better
I'm learnin to give
I'm learning to give
But I don't know if I'm a giver
I don't know if I'm a giver...
I got so much soul in my body
But no one keeping me honest
And whole days turn into holes in my mind...
I got high hopes, lots of potential
I'm high, broke, searching for symbols
And I will not let go of what is mine
I'm learnin to live
I'm tryna be better
I'm learnin to give
But I don't know if I'm a giver
I'm learnin to live
I'm tryna be better
I'm learnin to give
But I don't know if I'm a giver
giver
