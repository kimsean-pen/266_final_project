The mark I breathe on you
It's burning through your soul
The breath I waste
Losing control
I bleed in pain
Testing what I know
Lips soaked in deceit
Pull me from here
No one's innocent
So why do I feel bad?
But guilt keeps creeping, creeping up on me (up on me)
Guilt. Tearing me up inside
The innocent
An evil in disguise
The face of beauty to fall for
I fall to my knees, deceitful
Brought down by feelings of regret
Again your mind has failed the test
Not everyone feels the same
Pacifist blinded by the game
Stand tall. They'll break your heart
Stand tall. They'll smash your ego
Stand tall. They'll tear you down
Stand tall. Scar your soul
Break your thought
Fuck your mind
The mark I breathe on you
It's burning through your soul
The breath I waste
Losing control
I bleed in pain
Testing what I know
Lips soaked in deceit
Pull me from this hole
