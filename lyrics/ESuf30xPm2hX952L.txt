I hear it
Echoing of every place that we've called our home
And I don't talk
Of any time I ever believed in the unknown
I need it
So I hold on to every mistake that I made alone
And I don't lie
When I say that we will never return to closing doors

Sleep tight in a new light
Through another warning call
Look down on the cold ground
No one try to break the fall

I feel it
Moving in an another direction we call our own
And I won't chase
Anyone who ever believed in what they stole
I need it
So I hold on to every piece of mine that I chose
And I don't lie
When I say that we will never return to closing doors

Sleep tight in a new light
Through another warning call
Look down on the cold ground
No one try to break the fall

Say you'll remember
To keep it all inside
You can run for the skyline
Your eyes open wide

Say you'll remember
To keep it all inside
You can run for the skyline
Your eyes open wide

(It's a memory)
Don't look away
(It's a memory)
Cause when we see it we are closer
Don't look away
Cause when we see it we are near

Say you'll remember
To keep it all inside
You can run for the skyline
Your eyes open wide

Say you'll remember
To keep it all inside
You can run for the skyline
Your eyes open wide

It's a memory, it's a memory, it's a memory, it's a memory
It's a memory, it's a memory, it's a memory, it's a memory
It's a memory, it's a memory, it's a memory, it's a memory
It's a memory, it's a memory, it's a memory, it's a memory
