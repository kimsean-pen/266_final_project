Tell a lie, tell a lie that makes me want to stay
Give me something out of nothing, if it's not too late
If it's real, if it's real, I guess I'll feel the pain
Come in closer, out of focus

Oh, and it's hard to
It's hard to love someone who can't be loved
But it's what you do, it's what you do

Baby, you're so cruel, you're so cruel
Cause you got me bound to you, bound to you
This love I can't undo, can't undo
Cause you got me bound to you, bound to you

Losing me, carelessly, you sacrifice
Give me something out of nothing, if it's not too late
Did you steal or borrow me and all my life?
Come in closer, out of focus

Oh, and it's hard to
It's hard to love someone who can't be loved
But it's what you do, it's what you do

Baby, you're so cruel, you're so cruel
Cause you got me bound to you, bound to you
This love I can't undo, can't undo
Cause you got me bound to you, bound to you

All I do is pray and it's keeping me awake
When I try to leave, I think that you need me
Do you?
Baby, you're so cruel, you're so cruel
But I'm still bound to you, bound to you

There's a line that pulls me back to you
There's only so much I can do
A bind that holds the spark
Wrapped around my heart
There's only so much I can do
When you got me bound to you

Baby, you're so cruel, you're so cruel
Cause you got me bound to you, bound to you
This love I can't undo, can't undo
Cause you got me bound to you, bound to you

All I do is pray and it's keeping me awake
When I try to leave, I think that you need me
Do you?
Baby, you're so cruel, you're so cruel
But I'm still bound to you, bound to you
I'm still bound to you, bound to you
I'm still bound to you
I'm still bound to you
I'm still bound to you
