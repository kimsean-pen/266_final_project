I hope you're having fun
Where's your uniform, where's your gun?
Better rub up that suntan lotion 'cause you'll be fighting in the hot sun

It's not Vietnam
Just another oil company scam
Salute that flag from Uncle Sam
Get your money out, place your bets, it's Afghanistan!

Fix bayonets, check grenades
Got enough bullets, got enough rounds to wipe out this place
Where is the infantry and the cavalry?
Parachutes fill the skies as bodies burn and people die
