Took back time, take an instant pleasure
Credit is due for the life of leisure
Get to work and work gets done
Best at being was not best at all

Face the facts, being best got fitter
Simple tastes won't suit me better
Used to matter but that got done
Best at being was not best at all

Nothing stays the same
Always change to remain
Less than fine, peace of mind
Keep in check there is no time

Less than fine, peace of mind
Keep in check there is no time

Tasks take time and time took effort
Packed in pieces and pieced together
Tend to work and work gets done
Best at being was not best at all

Nothing stays the same
Always change to remain
Less than fine, peace of mind
Keep in check there is no time

Less than fine, peace of mind
Keep in check there is no time
Less than fine, peace of mind
Keep in check there is no time

Less than fine, peace of mind
Keep in check there is no time
Less than fine, peace of mind
Keep in check there is no time
