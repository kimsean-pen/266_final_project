If she don't love me
What can I do?
Just put on my best, pair of shoes
Because
Oh, I'm me!
Because she said, he's the one
That thrill her charms
Honey lets go wrong
I just want to know!
Whats, wrong with me
Be in love with you...

Yeaaaaah...

9th grade had the jingles of the swinging rainbow jacket
Law slain go only Django
Snap he accomplished
That's where my props go
That's where my pops went
See my percentage is a pennant to the planet
Knock it out the ball park, Frankie
I should not tire this tire
To a better love, let the wings spread
It'll always come back, baby
Come back, shellac black, baby
A come back, flat black paint on a Chevy

If she don't love me
What can I do?
Just put on my best pair of shoes
Because, oh! I'm me
Because, oh! I'm me
Because, oh! I'm me

Never mind my tone when I told Pretty Tony
Listen to my tone, you ain't catchin' you a Tony
Award-winning walk when you running with a shottie
Why you running from us?
Why you messing with us?
We ain't got no guns, we just let the bears witness
The Grizzly, maybe Polar
You ain't ready, you ain't ready 'ready rolled up
Pulling a machete, cut the bamboo paper
And let's roll out baby

I just want to know
What's wrong with me?
