I don't know, can't decide
Should I widow, should I take a life?
I don't know, whose in my mind
Haven't been down there since 35

If you want me, you can have me
You can have me, but I'm all used up
In the sun, in the sunlight laughing
3D vision

Look at me, look at you
See the sunlight on the ocean
In my head, then the waves
Whistle and your hair blows away
I put my mind into the ocean
I haven't been down there for many long years
Tropical fruit, mystery caves sail stones
All books come from minutes so young
Lovely red raincoat
If you want me, you can have me
You can have me but I'm all used up
In sun, in the sunlight laughing
Cosmic vibrations
Love is the answer
But where must we go again?
Where do we come from?
