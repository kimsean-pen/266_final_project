They think that we're no one
We're nothing, not sorry
They push us
It's too late, it's too late
not going back.
夢は終わり 目をさます時
絶望や希望も 同時に目を覚ました
鏡に映った 僕が問いかける
自分を誤魔化し 生きることに意味はあるか
When you're standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet
Now here to hold you
'Cause we are, we are
The colors in the dark
酷く痛む 鼓動は早く
遠のく景色を この手で掴もうとした
They are the weakest
They don't even know
Anything they say
Will never break our hearts of gold
When you're standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet
No here to hold you
'Cause we are, we are
The colors in the dark
Never tell yourself
"You should be someone else"
Stand up tall and say
"I'm not afraid, not afraid"
So never tell yourself
"You should be someone else"
Stand up tall and say
"I'm not afraid, not afraid"
When you're standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet
Now here to hold you
'Cause we are, we are
The colors in the dark
