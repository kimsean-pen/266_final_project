I'm not a man, not a man of tradition
I just wanna get pissed here in my kitchen
I'm not a loser, no
I'm not a loser
(She's not a loser)

People look at me like I am a hooker
But I just wanna be a venue booker
I'm not a loser, no
I'm not a loser
(She's not a loser)

All these badboys wanna spank me
Guess it's just their way to thank me
They all want the hanky-panky
They all want the hanky-panky
All these badboys wanna spank me
Guess it's just their way to thank me
They all want the hanky-panky

I'm deaf, I'm blind, but I'm alright
I'm poor, I'm broke, but I'm just fine
I'm deaf, I'm blind, but I'm alright
I'm poor, I'm broke, but I'm just fine

I fell asleep down there in the gutter
But it's no worries it' as smooth as butter
I'm not a loser, no
I'm not a loser
(She's not a loser)

My roommates think that I am a cunt
But I pay the rent on time every month
I'm not a loser, no
I'm not a loser
(She's not a loser)

I just had the best coffee
I got no worries
It's sunny outside and I'm gonna seal it
It's December, it's only getting hot now
That's alright for St. Kilda

I'm deaf, I'm blind, but I'm alright
I'm poor, I'm broke, but I'm just fine

All these badboys wanna spank me
Guess it's just their way to thank me
They all want the hanky-panky
They all want the hanky-panky
All these badboys wanna spank me
Guess it's just their way to thank me
They all want the hanky-panky

I'm deaf, I'm blind, but I'm alright
I'm poor, I'm broke, but I'm just fine
I'm deaf, I'm blind, but I'm alright
I'm poor, I'm broke, but I'm just fine
