Your toothbrush is where you left it
It sits right by my sink
Ever so often whilst brushing my teeth
My gum aches, my thoughts slink

Your toothbrush is where you left it
It sits right by my sink
Ever so often neglect my teeth
In reverie sit down, rethink

Sleepless nights
Senseless fights

Your toothbrush is where you left it
It sits right by my sink
Ever so often I grind my teeth
Abstain, deep-six this missing link
