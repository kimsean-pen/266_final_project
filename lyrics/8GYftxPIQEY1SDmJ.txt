Laid here.
With the advertising sliding past my eyes.
Like cartoons.
From other peoples lives.
I start to wonder.
What It takes to be a man.
Well I've learned to drink
And I've learned to smoke.
And I've learned to tell a Dirty joke.
Oh If thats all there is then theres no point for me.

So please can I ask just why we're alive.
When all that you do seems such a waste of time.
And if you hang around too long you'll be a man.
Tell me about it.
Your car can go up to one hundred and ten.
You've nowhere to go but you'll go there again.
And nothing makes a difference to a man.

Saw you stumbling in to town with your stomach in.
To show them what you've got though they've seen everything.
Yeah you're a beauty but they've seen it all before.
You've got the lead.
But still you want.
To go and book at restaurants.
Well I'm a fool.
And then you just fly away.

So please can I ask just why we're alive.
When all that you do seems such a waste of time.
And if you hang around too long you'll be a man.
Tell me about it.
Your car can go up to one hundred and ten.
You've nowhere to go but you'll go there again.
And nothing makes a difference to a man.
