Avoiding life, searching for an unknown light
Make them realize, they are the masters of their lies

Locked in the abyss of their thoughts
Crushing the gate of their minds

They are searching, in all this omnipresent perception
Spiritual path to fight deception
With assimilation through dimension of this strange and malevolent self-resistance
