Where did we come from?
Why are we here?
Where do we go when we die?
What lies beyondAnd what lay before?
Is anything certain in life?
They say "Life is too short""
The here and the now"And "
You're only given one shot"
But could there be more
Have I lived before
Or could this be all that we've got?
If I die tomorrow
I'd be alrightBecause I believe
That after we're gone
The spirit carries on
I used to be frightened of dying
I used to think death was the END
But that was before
I'm not scared anymore
Iknow that my soul will transcendI
I may never find all the answers
I may never understand WHY
I may never prove
What I know to be true
But I know that I still have to try
If I die tomorrow
I'd be alrightBecause I believe
That after we're gone
The spirit carries on
"Move on, be brave
Don't weep at my trave
Because I'm no longer here
But please never let
Your memories of me disappear
"Safe in the light that surrounds me
Free of the fear and the pain
My questioning mind
Has help me to find
The meaning in my life again
Victoria's real
I finally feel
At peace with the girl in my dreams
And now that I'm here
It's perfectly clear
I found out what all of this means
If I die tomorrow
I'd be alrightBecause I believe
That after weï¿½re gone
The spirit carries on
