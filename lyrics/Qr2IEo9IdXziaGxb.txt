You set the fire in me C-C
It's like I've learnt how to breathe easily
Photographed for a fashion magazine
It's just you, your God and me

I know it can't be easy for you
I know it can't be easy for you

You set the fire in me C-C
You set the fire in me
You set the fire in me C-C
You set the fire in me, oh

Why go home when you'd rather see me
Feels like all my heart can do now is bleed
We should go down to the sea
It's just you, our God and me

God no, it can't be easy for you
God no, it can't be easy for you

You set the fire in me C-C
You set the fire in me
You set the fire in me C-C
You set the fire in me, oh

You set the fire
You set the fire
You set the fire
You set the fire

You set the fire in me C-C
You set the fire in me
You set the fire in me C-C
You set the fire in me

You set the fire in me C-C
You set the fire in me
You set the fire in me C-C
You set the fire in me

You set the fire in me C-C
You set the fire in me
You set the fire in me C-C
You set the fire in me

You set the fire in me C-C
You set the fire in me
You set the fire in me C-C
You set the fire in me C-C

C-C, C-C, C-C, C-C
