We've been here before, passed out on the floor
On the floor
You tell me and all your friends
How you don't need me anymore
How you don't need me anymore
And who the fuck am I kidding? I know how this goes now
You never needed me like I needed you
So why the hell do I still wish you well?
You'll never know me like you think you do
As if it ever mattered cause after all, you don't need me anymore

Do you at least now see how much this means to me?
I can't wait another day, you've left me not knowing what to do
What to do
I beg you to stay, you act like you don't want to
Don't want to
I grind my teeth, I am losing sleep
These one-way conversations made me want to hate you
But I can't hate you
I can't hate you
Weighted down by things you've said
I'm staring in your eyes, they're dead
How can practice make us perfect
If our perfect is nothing?
And these choices I'm making are from promises you're breaking
Looking back on those wasted years, what was I thinking?
I can't wait another day, you've left me not knowing what to do
What to do
I beg you to stay, you act like you don't want to
Don't want to
I grind my teeth, I am losing sleep
These one-way conversations made me want to hate you
These conversations made me hate you
These conversations made me hate you
Let's bring you up to speed
This is the last you'll hear from me, the last you'll hear from me
Here's a note all in hopes
You'll find my aspirations at the end of this rope
It'll make you see what this meant to me
Now you're just a witness at a tragedy
Now you're just a witness at a tragedy
I died all alone, just like I knew all along
That's how it always played out in my head
Since I was a fucked up kid
And I was holding my breath about this
So when these tired lungs just caved
I knew I'd never be something you'd miss
And deep down through this fa√ßade you see
I just couldn't be the better man
You hoped I could be
