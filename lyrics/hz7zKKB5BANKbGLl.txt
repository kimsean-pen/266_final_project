Where do I begin, with this life we're living in
Market youth their uniform, make us all fit in
But do you think, that we're that blind?
That we can't see through all your lies

Cause it's no good
Burn burn the stations
We'll burn it down
Burn burn the truth
Enjoy the flames
In celebration
Enjoy the sound
For us, for them, for you

I know that I've been told
My intergrity was sold
Priced and placed upon the shelf
It's worth it's weight in gold
But do you think we've lost our minds?
Yeah we can see through all your lies

Cause it's no good
Burn burn the stations
We'll burn it down
Burn burn the truth
Enjoy the flames
In celebration
Enjoy the sound
For us, for them, for you

Burn burn the truth the lies the news
Burn burn the life that you cant choose
Burn burn the hate that gets you through
Burn burn for us, for them, for you Cause it's no good
Burn burn the stations
We'll burn it down
Burn burn the truth
Enjoy the flames
In celebration
Enjoy the sound

For us, for them, for you
For us, for them, for you
For us, for them, for you
For us, for them, for you
For us, for them, for you
Enjoy the sound
For us, for them, for you
For us, for them, for you
For us, for them, for you
For us, for them, for you
For us, for them, for you
