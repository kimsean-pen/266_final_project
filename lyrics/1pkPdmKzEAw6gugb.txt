I got something to say
I killed your baby today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as it's dead

Well, I got something to say
I raped you mother today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as she spread

Sweet lovely death,
I am waiting for your breath
Come sweet death, one last caress

Go!

Sweet lovely death
I am waiting for your breath
Come sweet death, one last caress

I got something to say
I killed your baby today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as it's dead

Sweet lovely death
I am waiting for your breath
Come sweet death, one last caress

One last caress, sweet death
One last caress, sweet death
