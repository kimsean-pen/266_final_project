Try and snap me out
Of this cruel phase
Scattered limbs about
Stops me thinkin'
Focus in & out
Start to fade
Better spit it out
Cause it's not stickin'
Set my heart alight
Bail me up all night
Beat me up all night
Set my heart alight
Try and snap me out
Of this blas√©
Try and blow my cool
While it's still sinkin
Focus in & out
Start to vague
I don't even clock
The tock you're tickin'
Set my heart alight
Stick me up all night
Bail me up all night
Set my heart alight
Stitch me up all night
Destined 2 collide
