Someone's out there
Waiting for me
I have to find her
And tell her
That I love her

Someone's out there
Waiting for me
I have to find her
And tell her
That I love her

You're a million miles away
The bridge between winter and summer
Seems like a bummer but it's worth the wait
And I know you'll shine the way
With your lava lamp (lava lamp)
In the middle of your room
From my window I could see
Bright blue light was shining deep
Like the sea on New Year's Eve
Wishing you were next to me
Yesterday in LA
It was sunny but it rained
In my room (in my room)
When I wrote a song for

Someone's out there
Waiting for me
I have to find her
And tell her that
I love her

Someone's out there
Waiting for me
I have to find her
And tell her that
I love her

If only
You'd hold me
And I wasn't
One billion miles away

If only
You'd hold me
And I wasn't
One billion miles away

If only
You'd hold me
And I wasn't
One billion miles away

If only
You'd hold me
And I wasn't
One billion miles away

Someone's out there
Waiting for me
I have to find her
And tell her that
I love her

Someone's out there
Waiting for me
I have to find her
And tell her that
I love her

Someone's out there
Waiting for me
I have to find her
And tell her that
I love her

Someone's out there
Waiting for me
I have to find her
And tell her that
I love her
