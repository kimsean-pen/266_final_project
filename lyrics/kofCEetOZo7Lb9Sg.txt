Some things are out of my hands
I'm what time and consequence have made me
Sit back and watch the world explode
3, 2, 1 here come the fireworks baby

Sometimes you can feel so smart
Just like a ghost in school clothes
But my days are mostly hazy
3, 2, 1 here comes the hurricane baby

Yeeaah identify
Identify
Yeaaah identify
Identify

Don't stand in line identify

Yeeaaah, I bought the last plane ticket to the end of the world
Who ever says that the good die young?
All the boys are alive
All the boys are with girls
Time to give them what they're waiting for

If the drugs don't work then you probably need more
If the drugs don't work then you probably need more

Time to give them what they're waiting for
Yeaaah identify, identify
Yeaaah identify, identify
Don't stand in line
No don't stand in line identify

Some things are out of my hands
