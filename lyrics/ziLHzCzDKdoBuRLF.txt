I was lost, on my own
and I couldn't bear the thought of my life
I was gone, caught in the torturing memories
And they burned like fire
water can never heal such pain

Can't you believe
Nothing is real
Can't you see
I cannot feel

Take me away
Bury me in the sand
cause after all these years I am still the same
a sad and bitter man

Take me away
Bury me in the sand
cause after all these years I am still the same
a sad and bitter man

Crush my hope, grow my hate
There's no home for me
Nothing to give, nothing to say
so tell me it's a dream

Can't you believe
Nothing is real
Can't you see
I cannot feel

Take me away
Bury me in the sand
cause after all these years I am still the same
a sad and bitter man

Take me away
Bury me in the sand
cause after all these years I am still the same
a sad and bitter man

Crush my hope, grow my hate
There's no home for me
Nothing to give, nothing to say
so tell me it's a dream

Crush my hope, grow my hate
There's no home for me
Nothing to give, nothing to say
so tell me it's a dream
