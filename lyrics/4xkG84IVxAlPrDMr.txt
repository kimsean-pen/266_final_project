They say the good die young,
While the bad they just have their fun.
The ugly got no one
A thousand kisses for the morning sun
Don't bow your head while you lay in your deathbed
Just sing shalalalala
Don't bow you head when you lay in your deathbed
Shalalalala
It will be okay kid,
Got your ticket for the new sensation
Body is breaking,
A thousand kisses for the morning shakes man
Don't bow your head while you lay in your deathbed
Just sing shalalalala
Don't bow you head when you lay in your deathbed
Shalalalala,
Shalalalala,
Shalalalala
Don't bow your head while you lay in your deathbed
Just sing shalalalala
Don't bow you head when you lay in your deathbed
Shalalalala
Shalalalala
