Sip my blood till there's no blood left to spill
From my neck embraced by a concealed grip I welcomed in my arms
Bruised by your love
Burned by your kiss
Is this true love?

Young blood spills tonight
This time the victum is you
Poison lips, the ones you kiss
I swear my love for you is true
Young blood spills

Now there I sing my deadly lullaby
Bruised by your love
Burned by your kiss
Is this true love?
Bruised by your love
Burned by your kiss
Is this true love?
Now there I sing my deadly lullabyu
Now here I sing to hypnotize your body
Now there I sing my deadly lullaby
Now here I sing to hypnotize your body
We bled that night till drained
You drank me dry I did the same
We bleed this night till drained
This cold
We bled that night till drained
You drank me dry I did the same
We bleed this night till drained
This cold night
