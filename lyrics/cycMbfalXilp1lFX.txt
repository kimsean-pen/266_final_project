Listen to me
I'm not saying it's impossible, maybe I just need a little sympathy
Though I'm guessing it would help if I opened my heart to somebody
I may feel a little better if I could just get my conscience clear
I want to disappear

I've seen the life dragged out of me
But I'm wasting breath on every broken dream
I'll wait for an answer
So this spark inside of me can burn bright enough to keep me company

I see that

We're all waiting for an answer but we don't see the signs
I'm hiding in the background while they all live their lives
There's so much time left but time scares me the most
Counting down the days until I am not alone

Look at me
Look at the state of my fate, I'm fading away, my anxiety
I'm at war with myself, maybe someone can help?
But I'm positive that with a little bit of strength I can turn this around
And separate the darkest of days, step into the light again

I see that

We're all waiting for an answer but we don't see the signs
I'm hiding in the background while they all live their lives
There's so much time left but time scares me the most
Counting down the days until I am not alone

I might find myself once I put myself through hell
Or maybe I need it a minute to realise that my life's falling away
Listen to me
I'm not saying it's impossible, maybe I just need a little sympathy
Though I'm guessing it would help if I opened my heart...

We're all waiting for an answer but we don't see the signs
I'm hiding in the background while they all live their lives
There's so much time left but time scares me the most
Counting down the days until I am not alone
