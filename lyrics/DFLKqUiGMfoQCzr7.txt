this forest
is growing faster than I can tell
cell structure

eats away at a massive swell
it seems however
im a victim of circumstance
hunt for

ogres and dwarfs
lion slicer
run (run) with (with) death

run (run) with (with) death
white faces coming closer with every step
eart envelopes taking breath without hesitance
carve my teeth out ripping through the sheep's head curse

hunter
gatherer
ridden from the cave
run (run) with (with) death
run (run) with (with) death
gone away my hearts gone away taken everything my hearts gone away take it now
run (run) with (with) death
gone away my hearts gone away taken everything my hearts gone away take it now
