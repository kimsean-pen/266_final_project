I was screaming pure blue
I was looking for you
Nothing matters when I'm home
Frozen, you've got me frozen in time
Pure blue
Pure blue
All my life
All my life
(Music)
It's all I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
It's all I ever needed, all I ever needed
All I ever needed, all I ever needed
Pure blue
Pure blue
All my life
All my life
Pure blue
Pure blue
All my life
All my life
(Music)
It's all I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
It's all I ever needed, all I ever needed
All I ever needed, I know it's (something I can't understand) to you
(Music)
