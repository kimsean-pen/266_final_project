I got this habit and I just can't stop
Every time I look at you
Your clothes are coming off
And when we're talking, my mind is somewhere else
Back at my apartment, you and me, and no one else

I'm having visions, it's like I can see right through
I've got a feeling, you know what I wanna do

I'm just gonna say it
And I don't know how you'll take it
I think about you naked when I'm looking at you
My imagination got me losing concentration
I think about you naked when I'm looking at you

Always, always
I think about
Always
I think about you naked when I'm looking at you

My mind is cray
Playing tricks on me
And everyone around us don't see what I see
In a crowded bar or a restaurant
Everybody doesn't know that you've got nothing on

I'm having visions, it's like I can see right through
I've got a feeling, you know what I wanna do

I'm just gonna say it
And I don't know how you'll take it
I think about you naked when I'm looking at you
My imagination got me losing concentration
I think about you naked when I'm looking at you

Always, always
I think about
Always
I think about you naked when I'm looking at you

Too many days I think about it
Too many nights I've spent without it
I need a way to get things started
Get you out of my head
And get you in my arms, yeah

I'm just gonna say it
And I don't know how you'll take it
I think about you naked when I'm looking at you
My imagination got me losing concentration
I think about you naked when I'm looking at you

Always, always
I think about
Always
I think about you naked when I'm looking at you
