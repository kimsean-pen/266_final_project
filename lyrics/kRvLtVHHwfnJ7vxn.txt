If i bleed tonight
If i am sad tonight
I don't have a job to find (if i)
Work tonight
If i'm so tired tonight
I'll fall asleep when i'm home
When i'm home

I was just so far from here
Focused on my own way
Without never looking back
To those who lived in fear

There was nothing i could do
There was nothing you said
That could make me realize
How much lucky i was

Just out of reach of this fire
I was not aware of this nightmare
But when i start to see those eyes
Begging for help and begging for hope

I just need to open my eyes now
To try to change and to search how
To be someone among others
I've got to try

If i bleed tonight
If i am sad tonight
I don't have a job to find (if i)
Work tonight
If i'm so tired tonight
I'll fall asleep when i'm home
When i'm home

There's no name to call
The ones that can't see
The light that shines
Above their lives

I can't say my life is crap
I have to see them too
I just lived into my world
Far from the pain they feel

Just out of reach of this fire
I was not aware of this nightmare
But when i start to see those eyes
Begging for help and begging for hope

I just need to open my eyes now
To try to change and to search how
To be someone among others
I've got to try (and...)

If i bleed tonight
If i am sad tonight
I don't have a job to find (if i)
Work tonight
If i'm so tired tonight
I'll fall asleep when i'm home

I was so wrong
I was so blind
I was so dumb and out of time
I was so wrong
I was so blind
I was so blind
If i bleed tonight
If i am sad tonight
I don't have a job to find (if i)
Work tonight
If i'm so tired tonight
I'll fall asleep when i'm home
When i'm home
When i'm home
When i'm home
When i'm home
