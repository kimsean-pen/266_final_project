I'm laying around
My head on the ground
I feel
That they're sinking in
They're walking around
I'm looking for ground
I feel
That they're listening

There's something here
And my head feels heavy
There's something here
And my head feels heavy

There's nothing to say
Should keep them away
I feel
That nothing's real
I'm turning around
To touch the ground
I feel
That nothing's real

There's something here
And my head feels heavy
There's something here
And my head feels heavy

I'm laying around
My head on the ground
I feel
That they're sinking in
I'm walking around
I'm looking for ground
I feel
That they're listening

There's something here
And my head feels heavy
There's something here
And my head feels heavy
