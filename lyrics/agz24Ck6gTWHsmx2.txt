Do you recall the days
At your old place?
Playing with Troll dolls to
Scare the kids away
My closet was a time machine
Your's the stage
I wish we told those little girls
They're gonna be okay
Still picture it all in my mind
Making the campfire out of broken flashlights
Jealous of your high tops
'Cause someone stole mine
Wish somebody would've told
Me that would be alright

My kind of time's meant to
Carelessly spend
And my kind of nights are
The one's that don't end
My kind of fun doesn't make any sense
And my kind of love you won't ever forget
My kind of time's meant to carelessly spend
And my kind of nights are
The one's that don't end
My kind of fun doesn't make any sense
And my kind of love you won't ever forget

Do you remember all the
Cartoons at midnight?
Like the one about the crass
Humoured French guy
And what about you, Mister Poetry?
And what about all that we've
Built in just a couple weeks?
Talkin' 'bout all of our fears
Through a cracked screen
Picking little fights over falling asleep
I wish you knew I loved you
When I knew you loved me
Really wish I knew you
Sooner than my twenties

My kind of time's meant to
Carelessly spend
And my kind of nights are
The one's that don't end
My kind of fun doesn't make any sense
And my kind of love you won't ever forget
My kind of time's meant to
Carelessly spend
And my kind of nights are the one's that don't end
My kind of fun doesn't make any sense
And my kind of love you won't ever forget

I'm a product of the who's
When's and how's
Those who let go and those
Who stuck around
I wish somebody would've
Told me I'd be here now
'Cause this kind of life is one
To sing about (Oh yeah)

My kind of time's meant to carelessly spend
And my kind of nights are
The one's that don't end
My kind of fun doesn't make any sense
And my kind of love you won't ever forget
My kind of time's meant to carelessly spend
And my kind of nights are
The one's that don't end
My kind of fun doesn't make any sense
And my kind of love you won't ever forget

My kind of love you won't ever forget
Wish somebody would've told
Me that would be alright
