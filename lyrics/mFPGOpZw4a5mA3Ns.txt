I'm going up the country
Baby, don't you wanna go?
I'm going up the country

Baby, don't you wanna go?
I'm going to some place
Where I've never been before.

I'm going, I'm going
Where the water tastes like wine.
I'm going

Where the water tastes like wine.
We can jump in the water,
Stay drunk all the time.
I'm gonna leave this city,

Got to get away.
I'm gonna leave this city,
Got to get away.
All this fussing and fighting,
Man, you know I sure can't stay.
Now baby, pack your leaving trunk
You know we've got to leave today,
Just exactly where we're going I cannot say,
But we might even leave the U.S.A.
'Cause there's a brand new game that I wanna play.
No use of you running,
Or screaming and crying.
'Cause you've got a home,
As long as I've got mine.
