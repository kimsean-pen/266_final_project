There's no doubt in my mind when it's over,
what is done will be
You will find when life gets colder there's no sympathy
There's no point trying, you can't escape the bitter end
Well, who will greet you when you're at the bitter end

All your choices chosen, you've got no say, your decisions made
Face your consequences as your life begins to fade
As time keeps spinning closer to the bitter end
Well, who will greet you when you're at the bitter end
Slip

Take a look at yourself, time keeps racing, is all you've come to be
What you expected, are you still chasing possibilities
'Cause all your prayers won't save you from the bitter end
Well, who will greet you when you're at the bitter end

The bitter end
The bitter end soon
