Wander with me, we can disappear
Hand still touching
So you know I'm near
Wander with me, sweets will hold us down
Leave it all now
'Cause I need you around, around around around

And baby, it's alright with me
I can be all that you need
Baby, it's alright with me
Wander wander wander
And baby, it's alright with me
I can be all that you need
Baby, it's alright with me
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

Wander with me, need to call you home
You fell nothing
Now you never feel alone
Wander with me, winder won't let go
Dream of sunlight
Lining your shadow

And baby, it's alright with me
I can be all that you need
Baby, it's alright with me
Wander wander wander
And baby, it's alright with me
I can be all that you need
Baby, it's alright with me
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

And baby, it's alright with me
I can be all that you need
Baby, it's alright with me
Wander wander wander
And baby, it's alright with me
I can be all that you need
Baby, it's alright with me
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
