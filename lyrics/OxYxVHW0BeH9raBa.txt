Open the door, there you're standing in a row
Dancing in a twisted blue form of light, turning over
Making a sound, then you're braiding it around
Turning in a twisted blue form of light, moving your shoulders

One, two, you move your feet, your shoes
Flying like a arrow in the room

Be my angel, love
Tell me everything I need from above
Be my heroin, tell them please
What we need to never be sin

Be forever sun
Never, never, ever stop everyone
Be my shining light
Lady, I believe you transform the night

You open my mind, got me floating out of time
Dancing in a twisted blue form of light, turning over
Drifting a sound, got me turning it around
Moving in a twisted blue form of life, moving your shoulders

One, two, you move your feet, your shoes
Flying like a arrow in the room

Be my angel, love
Tell me everything I need from above
Be my heroin, tell them please
What we need to never be sin

Be forever sun
Never, never, ever stop everyone
Be my shining light
Lady, I believe you transform the night

Be my angel, love
Tell me everything I need from above
Be my heroin, tell them please
What we need to never be sin

Be forever sun
Never, never, ever stop everyone
Be my shining light
Lady, I believe you transform the night
