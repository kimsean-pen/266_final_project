Love, love is a verb
Love is a doing word
Feathers on my breath
Gentle impulsion
Shakes me, makes me lighter
Feathers on my breath
Teardrop on the fire
Feathers on my breath

Nine nights of matter
Black flowers blossom
Feathers on my breath
Teardrop on the fire
Of a confession
Feathers on my breath
Black flowers blossom
Feathers on my breath

Water is my eye
Most faithful mirror
Feathers on my breath
Teardrop on the fire
Of a confession
Feathers on my breath

Most faithful mirror
Feathers on my breath
Teardrop on the fire
Feathers on my breath

You're stumbling into all
You're stumbling into all
