We've searched the world for truth
as we cull the pure, the heart,
the good

The road twists and turns
vaults howl, mountains burn
As we cull, the pure,
the heart, the good

eyes burning like fire
eyes burning like the sun

We've searched the world for truth
as we cull the pure,
the heart, the good

Glancing over distant space
Grey dawn, soul crusade
The phoenix hope winds her way
through desert skies

still defying fortunes spite
reviving from ashes and rise
the phoenix hope wings her way
through desert skies

Eyes burn like fire
Eyes burn like the sun

When it's time it flies faster
than our minds
when it's pure, it's harder to secure
When it's good, we're more careful
than we should
Trails of memories haunt her

When it's time it flies faster
than our minds
when it's pure, it's harder to secure
When it's good, we're more careful
than we should
Trails of memories chase her

Still defying fortune's spite
reviving from ashes and rise
the phoenix hope wings her way
through desert skies

Facing the sun life ignites
fiery dawn soul search
the phoenix hope burns away
to eternity

still defying fortune's spite
reviving from ashes and rise
the phoenix hope renews itself
from its remains
