Lost my shape
Trying to act casual
Can't stop
I might end up in the hospital
Changing my shape
I feel like an accident
They're back
To explain their experience

Isn't it weird?
Looks too obscure to me
Wasting away
That was their policy

I'm ready to leave
I push the fact in front of me
Facts lost
Yeah, facts are never what they seem to be
Nothing there
No information left of any kind
L-l-lifting my head
L-l-looking for the danger signs

There was a line
There was a formula
Sharp as a knife
Facts cut a hole in us
There was a line
There was a formula
Sharp as a knife
Facts cut a hole in us

I'm still waiting, I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting, I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting, I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting, I-I-I'm still waiting

The feeling returns
Whenever we close our eyes
Lifting my head
Looking around inside

The island of doubt
It's like the taste of medicine
Working by hindsight
Got the message from the oxygen
M-m-making a list
Find the cost of opportunity
Doing it right
Facts are useful in emergencies

The feeling returns
Whenever we close our eyes
Lifting my head
Looking around inside

Facts are simple and facts are straight
Facts are lazy and facts are late
Facts all come with points of view
Facts don't do what I want them to
Facts just twist the truth around
Facts are living turned inside out
Facts are getting the best of them
Facts are nothing on the face of things

I'm still waiting, I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting, I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting, I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting, I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting, I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting, I-I-I'm still waiting
