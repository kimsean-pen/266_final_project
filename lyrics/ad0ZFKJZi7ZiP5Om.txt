Feeling without touching
Oh feel us we are laughing
Oh with the angle gloves(glows)
Oh see me see me laugh laugh laugh myself away
Away away from doubt(thow)
My crown is tipped up
My world is zipped up tight
That's all ()
With touchable ornaminets placed around
Like eyes and teeth (of(or(oh))) shine of gold and diamonds oh
We smile we smile we smile we can't be rude no
Feeling withut touching
Oh feel us we are laughing
Oh with the angle gloves(glow)
My world is zipped up tight
That's all ()
With touchable ornaminets placed around
Like eyes and teeth (of(or(oh))) shine of gold and diamonds oh
We smile we smile we smile we can't be rude no
Feeling without touching
Uhoh, uhoh
Feeling without touching
Uhoh, uhoh
Feeling without touching
Uhoh
