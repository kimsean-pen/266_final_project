I'm growing like a seed, rain's been falling on me
I've been covered in cold, I've been shrouded in doubt
My heart is on a wire, sailing pretty like a bird,
But the hunter is out, and the eagle has heard

The words that I feel, feel it all
Yes, I can feel, feel it all

I'm looking to the sky, and I'll be listening to the stars
And maybe thinking of you, and wondering where you are
Do you know what you've done for me? You made my branches grow
Now they can play with the wind, and they can carry the snow

And they (we) can feel, feel it all
Yes, they (we) can feel, feel it all

So take what you want, and leave what you don't need
And I'll go looking for you, you keep your eye out for me
'Cause our heart is on a wire, sitting pretty like a bird,
But the hunter is hunting, and the eagle is ours
