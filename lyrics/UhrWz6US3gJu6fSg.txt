Tell me you love me to sleep, cognac
Whiskey sour and your blue eyes
I don't want you any less
Rhythm bitten by your teeth

Tell me you love me too
Tell me you love to sleep, cognac
Whiskey sour and your blue eyes
I don't want you any less
Rhythm bitten by your teeth

Tell me you love me too
Tell me you love me to sleep
Whiskey sour and your blue eyes
I don't want you any less
Rhythm bitten by your teeth

Tell me you love me too
Tell me you love me to sleep
