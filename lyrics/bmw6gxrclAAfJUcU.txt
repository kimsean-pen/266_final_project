Listen
It's funny how I gave and still it ain't enough
All you do is turn around a veneer
Slow up first and turn it to a game of lust
Lighter to the picture, we were playing, oh
And now I'm convinced
As we go through this shit
We both know we should let this go, yeah
Let this go, yeah

You wanted nice, you wanted bad
You wanted first it wouldn't last
You spin me 'round so fucking fast
And you left me out there on my ass
You wanted bad but wanted good
You said you would but never could

It ain't gotta be all that, no
I could leave you so sweetly, so sweetly
Even though I may seem sad (so sad)
I could leave you so-

I'm here but my heart's gone
Tried my best but couldn't fix it with a love song
It's so hard to forgive
When you remind me of who I wanna forget
So we ain't gotta fight
All we gotta do is make up our mind
You know it's just that simple
Peace of mind's detrimental

You wanted nice, you wanted bad
You wanted first it wouldn't last
You spin me 'round so fucking fast
And you left me out there on my ass
You wanted bad but wanted good
You said you would but never could

It ain't gotta be all that, no
I could leave you so sweetly, so sweetly
Even though I may seem sad (so sad)
I could leave you so-

'Cause boy you leave my love to hurt and hurt
And you gave me bars, you had the nerve
You spun me around so fucking fast
And you left me out there on my ass
Said you wanted bad but wanted good
You said that you would but never, never, never...

It ain't gotta be all that, no
I could leave you so sweetly, so sweetly
Even though it makes me sad (so sad)
Yeah, I could leave you so bad
