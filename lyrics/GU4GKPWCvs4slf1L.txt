Where's the love song to set us free
Too many people down
Everything turning the wrong way round

And I don't know what love will be
But if we stop dreaming now
Lord know we'll never clear the clouds

And you've been so busy lately
That you haven't found the time to open up your mind
And watch the world spinning gently out of time

Feel the sunshine on your face
It's in a computer now
Gone are the future way out in space

And you've been so busy lately
That you haven't found the time to open up your mind
And watch the world spinning gently out of time

And you've been so busy lately
That you haven't found the time, to open up your mind
And watch the world spinning gently out of time

Tell me I'm not dreaming but are we out of time
We're out of time, out of time, out of time
Out of time, out of time
