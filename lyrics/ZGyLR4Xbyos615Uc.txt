Walk across and talk to me
'Cause it's late and it's midnight
Know I need you now
Just a little sound to keep me going
Oh, it could be easy
Oh, it could be easy

Walk across and talk to me
Little whispers, just a little sound
Say what you're thinking, tell me where you're going
Cause I need you now
Well, it could be easy
Well, it could be easy

We keep on trying so hard, but I don't hear anything
We keep on trying so hard, but I don't hear anything
But all I want to hear is you

Walk across and talk to me
Just a little whisper in my ear
Tell me what you're thinking, thinking about
Well, it could be easy
Well, it could be easy

We keep on trying so hard, but I don't hear anything
We keep on trying so hard, but I don't hear anything
At all
And all I want to hear is you
And all I want to hear is you
And all I want to hear is you

What you saying
What you doing
Keep on talking louder and louder
What you saying
Keep on talking
Keep on talking louder and louder
Keep on talking louder and louder
Keep on talking louder and louder
