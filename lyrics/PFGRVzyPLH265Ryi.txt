Send me forwards, say my feelings
But all the signals send me reeling
Jigsaw feeling

One day I'm feeling total
The next I'm split in two
My eyes are doing somersaults
Staring at my shoe
My brain is out of my hand
There's nothing to prevent
The impulse is quite meaningless
In a cerebral non-event

Send me forwards, say my feelings
But all the signals send me reeling
Jigsaw feeling

Five fingers do my walking
Ten toes unravel knots
Amorphous jigsaw pieces
Falling into slots

Send me forwards, say my feelings
But all the signals send me reeling
Jigsaw feeling

So I just sit in reverie
Getting on my nerves
The intangible bonds that keep me
Sitting on the verge
Of a breakdown
Of a reaction
Of a result
Defeat me, complete me, maybe
Defeat me, defeat me
Jigsaw feeling
Defeat me
