When you're taught through feelings
When you're taught through feelings

When you're taught through feelings
When you're taught through feelings

Destiny flying high above
All I know is that you can realise

(Realise)
Destiny who cares

(Destiny who cares)
As it turns around

(As it turns around)

And I know that it descends down on me
It's just another day
The shame is gone

Hard to believe
That I've let it go

Let it go
Let it go

Destiny can't replace my life
Scary shadows of my past are alive

(Are alive)
Destiny who cares

(Destiny who cares)

As it turns around
(As it turns around)
And I know that it descends with a smile
Just another day
The shame is gone
It's Hard to believe
That I let it go away

It's just a melody
It bleeds in me
Hard to believe
That I let it go
When you're taught through feelings
When you're taught through feelings
When you're taught through feelings
When you're taught through feelings

Just another day
The shame is gone
It's Hard to believe
That I let it go away
It's just a melody
It bleeds in me
Hard to believe
That I let it go
Let it go
Let it go
