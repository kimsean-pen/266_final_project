When I was sleeping, all in my head
Sleeping in the dawn of time
And I was lifting, always higher
In the wind in the ever time
Do we sing it?

How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
I like it

How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
They're listening at

Why did I not try to get right with you
Through the universe tonight?
Look at the silence, much like your face
And the simphony helps me sing
Do we sing it?

How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
I like it

How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
They're listening at

How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?
How'd you like that?

I feel to you, you feel to me
(how'd you like that, how'd you like that, how'd you like that)
Let's walk together
Take you out across the seas
(how'd you like that, how'd you like that, how'd you like that)
To marry girl

I feel to you, you feel to me
(how'd you like that, how'd you like that, how'd you like that)
Let's walk together
Take you out across the seas
(how'd you like that, how'd you like that, how'd you like that)
Let's walk together
