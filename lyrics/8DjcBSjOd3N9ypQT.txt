We heard that enemies are approaching from the south
We marched to face them and killed their scout
But we were ambushed and slaughtered in the night
We fought so bravely but none were left alive
Now I open my eyes and what do I see
A rainbow in the moonlight valkyries calling me
They say "Don't be afraid" and ask me to follow.
"You've been expected, so forget your sorrow!"
Their warriors souls forever rejoice
Twilight Tavern!
With our ancestors we raise our horns
Twilight Tavern!
Their warrior's swords forever shine on
Twilight Tavern!
Welcoming our brothers at the break of dawn!
Twilight Tavern!
Life is so short
Oh son of the north
You'll find your peace
At the end of the journey
Life is so short
Oh son of the north
You'll find your peace
At the end of the journey
Hey! All greet us when we open the door
Familiar faces, brothers it's been too long
Beer is flowing, the smell of burning meat
In the morning battle reigns like hell's been unleashed
As the sun sets behind the mountain's peak
The master of the house shouts: "Drink and feast!"
This feels like it is too good to be true
The call for final battle will be here soon.
There warriors souls forever rejoice
Twilight Tavern!
With our ancestors we raise our horns
Twilight Tavern!
Their warrior's swords forever shine on
Twilight Tavern!
Welcoming our brothers at the break of dawn!
Twilight Tavern!
