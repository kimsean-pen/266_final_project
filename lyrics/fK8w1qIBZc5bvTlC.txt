Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh ah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh ah

I think it was the summer time
When I laid eyes on you
I didn't even know your name
Some how we'd end up in the same room
Never crossed my mind
I never saw you like that
I should've listened to my best friend
She knew we'd be a perfect match

It's a typical love story
We started out as friends
We met way back when
This is just a
Typical love story
The boy you never wanted
Just steals your heart
I never saw it comin'
Till I fell so hard

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh ah

I always made up some excuse
Sayin' that you weren't my type
Didn't wanna face the truth
Didn't wanna cross that line
Till one day I saw you
Out of the corner of my eye
You were flirting with some girl
And inside I thought I would die

It's a typical love story
We started out as friends
(friends)
We met way back when
(when)
This is just a typical love story
The boy you never wanted
Just steals your heart
I never saw it comin'
Till I fell so hard

Can't believe it's happening
When I least expect it
My prince under disguise
How you fooled me with those eyes
When I feel like letting go
In your arms is where I know
I am wrong
From the beginning
We always belong

Love Love Story Love
Love Story Love
Love Story Love
Love Story Love
Love Story Love
(This is my)
Love Story Love
(This is my Love Story)
Love Story love
Love Story Love
This is my Love Story

It's a typical love story
We started out as friends
This is how it ends
This is just a
Typical love story
The boy you never wanted
Just steals your heart
I never saw it comin'
Till I fell so hard

It's a typical love story
We started out as friends
This is how it ends
This is just a
Typical love story
The boy you never wanted
Just steals your heart
I never saw it comin'
Till I fell so hard
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh ah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh ah
