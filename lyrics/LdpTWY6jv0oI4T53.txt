It's not that i resent that you found someone
It's just i feel a bit sad that i did but couldn't hold on
And when doors close
And windows close
And then night closes in
It's just a bit too much time
For thinking

So make up your mind
Either you stay in touch
Or take off your hand completely
We don't need to be polite
But it's that song that you were singing
As you left
That keeps going around in my head

Oh you love this
The thought of me still holding on
Well it isn't out of longing
Just from fear of being forgotten
So don't make me someone needy
And say it isn't working for you
When it's you who made the blueprint
When it's all by your design

And if we fall apart
At the same time
And i come undone at the same lines
It doesn't mean that i'm falling in love
I never have
I never will

And if we fall apart
At the same time
And i come undone at the same lines
It doesn't mean that i'm falling in love
I never will

And if we fall apart
At the same time
And I come undone at the same lines
It doesn't mean that i'm falling in love

I never have
I never will
