Watching, watching, watching, watching you
Watching, watching, watching, watching you
Watching, I'm watching you (you)

What's it like in your apartment?
When no one has called you
When no one has called
You're waiting for the phone to ring 'cos you're home alone
It's never ringing now
It's never ringing now

Watching, watching, watching, watching you
Watching, watching, watching, watching you
Watching, I'm watching you (you)
Watching, watching, watching, watching you
Watching, watching, watching, watching you
Watching, I'm watching you (you)

Holding on to things that mean so little in the present
Means so little now
Where did the time go? (you)
Gets faster as we go
I feel it all around
I feel it all around

Watching, watching, watching, watching you
Watching, watching, watching, watching you
Watching, I'm watching you (you)
Watching, watching, watching, watching you
Watching, watching, watching, watching you
Watching, I'm watching you (you)

Watching, watching, watching, watching you
Watching, watching, watching, watching you
Watching, I'm watching you (you)
Watching, watching, watching, watching you
Watching, watching, watching, watching you
Watching, I'm watching you (you)
