When the joys of living just leave you cold
Frozen from the failing mess you made your own
And if you want an ending to your screenplay life
Well here's the consolation that will change your heart and mind

All the glitz messiah's just pass the time
A cure for no real sickness, cross your hopes and die
Your supermarket jesus comes with smiles and lies
Where justice he delays is always justice he denies

This will make you love again
This will make you love again
This will make you love again
This will make you love again

And now you save
Love again...
To feel the rays
Love again...
The sweet delays
Love again...
And shoot the breeze
Love again...

Early thursday mornings wipe away the flies
The crossfire fight for action in-between your thighs
Every touch is sacred when they leave the room
If I have to switch the lights off, I wanna switch them off with you

This will make you love again
This will make you love again
This will make you love again
This will make you love again

And now you save
Love again.
To feel the rays
Love again...
The sweet delays
Love again...
And shoot the breeze
Love again...
