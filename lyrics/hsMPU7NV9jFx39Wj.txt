Today, to you, I'm invisible
Tomorrow, you may still be out of reach
But someday, you and I will be possible
We'll all make love out on the beach

By then we won't remember what it was like
Before you and I fell in love
But we were at a knot together in this life
To imagine the way it was

You are the light of my life
(Light of my life)
My little piece of the pie
(My little piece of the pie)
American beauty, (American beauty)
Apple of my eye
You are the light of my life
(Light of my life) mm huh, mm huh

I've heard people say that if they could
Do it all over again, they never would
It's better to have loved someone and lost
Than to have never loved at all

I'm not afraid to give my heart
Even though it don't know I exist
'Cause in my sleep, you hold me close in the dark
How many times I've tasted your lips?

You are the light of my life
(The light of my life)
My little piece of the pie
(My little piece of the pie)
American beauty (American beauty)
apple of my eye
You are the light of my life
(Light of my life)

I'm savin' myself for you
There is no wait long enough, ain't no way I'm givin' up
Maybe I'm a fool
But nothin' makes me feel so right
Than dreamin' about you at night

You are the light of my life
My little piece of the pie
American beauty (American beauty)
Apple of my eye
You are the light of my life
(Light of my life)

You are the light of my life
(Light of my life)
My little piece of the pie
(My little piece of the pie)
American beauty (American beauty)
Apple of my eye
You are the light of my life
(Light of my life)
