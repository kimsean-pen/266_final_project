Her world collapsed early sunday morning
She got up from the kitchen table
Folded the newspaper and silenced the radio
Those creatures jumped the barricades
And have headed for the sea, sea

Woah
Woah

Those creatures jumped the barricades and have headed for the sea
She began to breathe to breathe
At the thought of such freedom
Stood and whispered to her child ["Belong."]
She held the child and whispered
With calm, calm; belong

Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah

Stood and whispered to her child ["Belong."]
She held the child and whispered
With calm, calm; ["Belong."]

Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah

These barricades can only hold for so long
Her world collapsed early Sunday morning
She took the child held tight
Opened the window
A breath, this song, how long
and knew, knew; ["Belong."]

Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
