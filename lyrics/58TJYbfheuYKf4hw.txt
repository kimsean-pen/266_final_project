Grab a pen up in the benz then i just rhyme rhyme rhyme
Other bitches cannot be here so they just run run run
Grab a pen up in the benz then i just rhyme rhyme rhyme
Other bitches cannot be here so they just run run run
Got that magic power
Sweet sweet poison I'm a tragic flower
Can't hear haters
Come at me louder
Supergirl I got superpowers
Eat these chicks like a soup of ours
Still no spice add the curry powder
Need me a man like Austin Powers
Hit all 3s when the floor is ours
No one fucking with my clique clique clique
Make that money time tick tick tick
Cash that money like bitch quick quick
Ta to the Tar I'm in this bitch
No one fucking with my clique clique clique
Make that money time tick tick tick
Cash that money like bitch quick quick
Ta to the Tar I'm in this bitch
Power! Pussy power!
Power! Pussy power!
Power! Pussy power!
Power! Pussy power!
All these goods and it's yours for the taking
All is good when if there's money for the making
Getting dough till enough for the baking
I'm is real ain't no time for the faking
Barbie doll man I ball till I fall
All missed calls when the broke boys call
Imma pick up when the smoke boy calls
Get too close get a kick to the balls
No one fucking with my clique clique clique
Make that money time tick tick tick
Cash that money like bitch quick quick
Ta to the Tar I'm in this bitch
No one fucking with my clique clique clique
Make that money time tick tick tick
Cash that money like bitch quick quick
Ta to the Tar I'm in this bitch
Power! Pussy power!
Power! Pussy power!
Power! Pussy power!
Pussy power! Pussy power!
