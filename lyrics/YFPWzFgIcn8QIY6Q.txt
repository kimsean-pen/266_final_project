It's just a little bit funny how we regress
Spillin' out like a flood, all we repress
We get a whole lot of reasons to shake the blame
If you can't fix your own problem, just change its name

Are we running to forget?
Are we running from regret?
Are we running to forget?
'Cause there's not a lot of common sense

Is there a little bit of danger on the road?
I feel more like a stranger in my own home
No one makes a mistake, no one cops to a lie
You can't pull your own weight if you never try

Are we running to forget?
Are we running from regret?
Are we running to forget?
'Cause there's not a lot of common sense

All your past transgressions are etched in time
There's no second chances when you've crossed the line
Play for the money, play for the team
Is this the very last gasp of a dying dream?

Are we running to forget?
Are we running from regret?
Are we running to forget?
'Cause there's not a lot of common sense
