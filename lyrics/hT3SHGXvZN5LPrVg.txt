Boxed unsettled
The flying metals
Race through the sky

Identify
See through the glass eye
Saying goodbye in the oppressor

Eyes compress the state of unrest
The size too much for them to address in the stark light from the stars
In the dark light in your eyes

Go on the propofol
Go on the sleeping lamb
Say nothing foreign or too rash

Stand aside
Let this ride
To the grave
Find yourself asleep on the ground

Go on to your sentinel
Go to your mother's womb
Coast

Stand aside
Let this ride
To the grave
Spend to save
End, the end of the days
End, the end of the days
To the grave
Find yourself asleep on the ground

Sacred constitution
Give this life the solution
Worship to the system
What does it cost

Your light
The light burns out

Beloved suicide
Beloved death

Boxed unsettled
The flying metals
Falling of like dying pedals
Identify
See through the glass eye
Saying goodbye in the oppressor

The end of the days
To the grave
Found yourself asleep on the ground
