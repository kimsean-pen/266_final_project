Don't change for me
You got nothing to fix
You're not broken
I know it was mean
Can we just start over?

Meet me as you are
Slow speak with your heart
I'm so sorry we tried so hard
Meet me as you are

Scars on your skin
Treasure where you feel ruined
If and for when
Not for your potential

Meet me as you are
Slow speak with your heart
I'm so sorry we tried so hard
Meet me as you are

You're all I need
Over everything
A secret guard inside you
Hidden away from view
It's in your life
Realize I see your gloom
You're all I need
Over everything
A secret guard that you keep hidden out of view
It's in your life
Realize I see your gloom

Shine like a vault
Deep in your heart you recover
The wound fills with salt
I let you down, betrayed you
Meet me as you are
