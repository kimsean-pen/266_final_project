I met him in a crowded room
Where people go to drink away their gloom
He sat me down and so began
The story of a charmless man

Educated the expensive way
He knows his Claret from his Beaujolais
I think he'd like to have been Ronnie Kray
But then nature didn't make him that way

He went na na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na na na, na na na na na

He thinks his educated airs
Those family shares will protect him
That we'll respect him
He moves in circles of friends
Who just pretend that they like him
He does the same to them
And when you put it all together
There's the model of a charmless man

Na na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na na na, na na na na na

He knows the swingers and their cabaret
Says he can get in anywhere for free
I began to go a little cross eyed
And from this charmless man I just had to hide

Na na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na na na, na na na na na

He talks at speed he gets nose bleeds
He doesn't see his days are tumbling
Down upon him
And yet he tries so hard to please
He's just so keen for you to listen
But no one's listening
And when you put it all together
There's the model of a charmless man

He thinks his educated airs
Those family shares will protect him
That you'll respect him
And yet he tries so hard to please
He's just so keen for you to listen
But no one's listening
And when you put it all together
There's the model of a charmless man
Na na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na na na, na na na na na
Na na na na na, na na na na na
