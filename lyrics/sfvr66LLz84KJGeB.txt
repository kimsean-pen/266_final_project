Disarm you with a smile
And cut you like you want me to
Cut that little child
Inside of me, is such a part of you
Oh, the years burn
Oh, the years burn

I used to be a little boy, so old in my shoes
And what I choose is my choice, what's a boy supposed to do?
A killer in me is a killer in you, my love
I send this smile over to you

Disarm you with a smile
And leave you like they left me here
To wither in denial
The bitterness of one who's left alone
Oh, the years burn
Oh, the years burn, burn, burn

I used to be a little boy, so old in my shoes
What I choose is my voice, what's a boy supposed to do?
A killer in me is a killer in you, my love
I send this smile over to you

A killer in me is a killer in you
I send this smile over to you
A killer in me is a killer in you
I send this smile over to you
A killer in me is a killer in you
Send this smile over to you
