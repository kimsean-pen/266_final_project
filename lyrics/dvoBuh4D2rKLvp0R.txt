Someday
When my life has passed me by
I lay around and wonder why
You were always there for me

One way
In the eyes of a passerby
I look around for another try
And fade away

Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
This place is warm without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave and you reach for me

Some say
Better things will come our way
No matter what they try to say
You were always there for me

Someway
When the sun begins to shine
I hear a song from another time
And fade away
And fade away

Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
This place is warm without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave and you reach for me

Someone said you tried too long
Someone said we got it all
Someone said we tried too long
Is there a place where I belong?

So far and so long
So far away
So far and so wrong
So far away, away, away

Some day
When my life has passed me by
I lay around and wonder why
You were always there for me
One way
In the eyes of a passerby
I look around for another try
And fade away.
And fade away.
And fade away
And fade away
