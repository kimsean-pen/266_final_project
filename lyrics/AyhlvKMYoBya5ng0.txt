We mesmerize, we spiritualize
We emphasize, try to survive

Scars
Scars and emotions
The fabric,
The fabric of our lives
No
No magic potions
As we strive
Strive to survive

We mesmerize, we spiritualize
We emphasize, try to survive

Some of us grow stronger
Some of us grow weak
As we fade into the oceans
Like stone beneath our feet
Our memories keep on burning
Like stars in the sky
Nothing lasts forever
We all have to die
No lasting moments
To ever say goodbye
Hope and devotion
As we travel into the light

Darkened hearts keep singing
But no one's there to hear
Our eyes are slowly burning
As we shed a final tear

We mesmerize, we spiritualize
We emphasize, try to survive
Mesmerize
Spiritualize
