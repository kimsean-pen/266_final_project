Nations battle on the field across the lands
Ruthless, stealing territories from our hands
Anger throwing down the victims to the ground
Cold blood younger soldiers weeping with no sound

Revolution striking down right now!

Blind fools fighting for the power to command
Flag poles threading down the freedom of our men
Innocence dying by the fury of the sword
Poor men falling before saying their last words

Revelation code XI
Striking over us

Sounds of revolution
Freedom is proclaimed
Bells announcing changes for the better
In the temple of hate
The temple of hate!
Satan awaits!

Revolution we have waited
Burning down our souls

Sounds of revolution
Freedom is proclaimed
Bells announcing changes for the better
In the temple of hate
Satan awaits!
The temple of hate!
