I kinda feel like i deserve this
butterflies all up in my stomach
like a first kiss just a words smith
usin poetry and more but to distracted
by these girls who want their juicy ca tour
this life is all about materials things
i got kids tricks bitch i am a serial king
every thing better if you relax and chill
so my seat back for weed naps
we need that for real
i took my heart put it all out on a cd
you now rocking with the bees knees
im the cats pajamas the coolest from the cool
the kid that got them gas tapping using up their fuel
when they first heard me spit they think that it would be shit
M-O-S-T to the D-O-P-E KIDS
See you effin h's now you hangin with a G bitch
i want money but they say i need Jesus

Half man half amazing
flya then a penguin you dryer than a raisin
hot like Cajun bringing all the girls to the Days Inn
ready for a little love making
yeah i want it now but they tell me have some patience
feelin on top of the world since graduation
now i do music all day cause there ain't no other option
drivin to Connecticut then flyin up to Boston
i put it on for my city always showing love
an over dose and drugs having people throwing up
they say what up when i drop in
i am just chilling back in my seat Joe Swanson
yeah i used to steal ipods and pawn them
now i take my girl for shopping no problem
live it up every second
life don't got a sequel
it's all good thumbs up for my people
