Maybe you thought
I hung the moon
Maybe you thought
We were johnny and june
Maybe we thought
It was just us two
Maybe we spoke too soon

We never lie
And we don't tell tales
We bite our tongues
And our fingernails
We fall in love
And we don't fall out
Maybe we speak too soon

Here's you and me
And in between
We draw a line
But we can't see
Where it's bend
We scratch our heads
And race against
The heart's content

Oho oho oho oh yeah

Maybe we hurt
Who we love the most
Maybe it's all we can stand
Maybe we walk through the world as ghosts
Break my own heart before you can

Here's you and me
And in between
We draw a line
But we can't see
Where it's bend
We scratch our heads
And race against
The heart's content

Ohoho yeah

Maybe we know how the story ends
Maybe it's not even about us
We both retreat to opposing sands
And the love lives on without us

One thing I know for sure is
Love will find a way
Love will find a way

Here's you and me
And in between
We draw a line
But we can't see
Where it's bend
We scratch our heads
And race against
The heart's content
Oho oho oho
You and me
Oho oho oho
You and me
Oho oho oho
You and me
Oho oho oho oh yeah
