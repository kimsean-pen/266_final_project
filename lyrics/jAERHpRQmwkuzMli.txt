The child was given food
But did not eat it
The child was given shelter
But did not sleep in
The child was given love
But did not take
The child was shown a path
That he could not make
No
The boy was given hope
But hope prevailed him
The boy was given a chance
But that chance failed him
The boy was given love
But did not take
The boy was shown a path
That he could not take
No
But he was hoping for the better yeah
Just like another man would do
But now it's only rainy weather
Nothings new
What to do
See the mornings come
But he don't see the morning sun
So he waits
He don't wait
He don't wait for the morning sun
See the morning has come
And the dark night will go
But still there's no sun
Just the mystic still shows
And Im feeling no shine
Just this rhythm inside
Yet still he hopes everything will be alright

He was hoping for the better
Just like another man would do
And now it's only rainy weather
Nothings new
What to do
When the morning comes
