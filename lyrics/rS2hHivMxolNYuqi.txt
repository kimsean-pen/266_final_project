Lonely road
Where will you go
Searching for something I don't know
I screamed out and someone listened
I saw a light out in the distance
I've been out here searchin'
All my bridges burnin'
Kept my heart a virgin
For you
You are my discovery
Everything I'll ever need
You are my discovery
It's so hard to find this feeling
You are my discovery
Opened up my eyes to see
You are my discovery
It's so hard to find this feeling
You lit a spark
You kept me warm
When I was breaking in the storm
Oh breaking heart don't you fade
Do you know the life that you've saved
I've been out here searchin'
All my bridges burnin'
Kept my heart a virgin
For you
You are my discovery
Everything I'll ever need
You are my discovery
It's so hard to find this feeling
You are my discovery
Opened up my eyes to see
You are my discovery
It's so hard to find this feeling
And wherever you go, I go
Yeah wherever you go,
Follow you, lead the way
You know I know
You are my discovery
Everything I'll ever need
You are my discovery
It's so hard to find this feeling
You are my discovery
Opened up my eyes to see
You are my discovery
It's so hard to find this feeling
And wherever you go, I go
Yeah wherever you go,
Follow you, lead the way
You know I know
And wherever you go, I go
Yeah wherever you go,
Follow you, lead the way
You know I know
You are my discovery
