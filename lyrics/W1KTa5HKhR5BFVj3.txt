Ain't that the way it always starts
A simple round of conversation
Became a shameful equation
I flipped to station to station

Hey
Don't go and turn the other way
Don't say there's nothing more to

Say

Come on
Hear me out

Hush
Hush
Settle down
Button up
Don't make a sound

Shame
Shame
Go away

Come again
Some other day
You used to say I couldn't save you enough
So I've been savin' it up

I started savin' it up
And when you said I couldn't give you enough

I started givin' you up
I started givin' you up
You are not me

Arlandria
Arlandria
You and what army
Arlandria

Arlandria

Oh God you gotta make it stop
Chase
All of those memories away
Save them all for another
day
Don't you remember it was rain

that
drowned
you
Wait
I wanna see if you can
change
I wanna keep all I can

take
I feel much better now
Use me up
Spit me out
Let me be
your hand-me-down
Fame
Fame
Go away
Come again
Some other day

You used to say I couldn't save you enough
So I've been savin' it up
I started savin' it up
And when you said I couldn't give you enough
I started givin' you up
I started givin' you up
You are not me

Arlandria
Arlandria
You and what army
Arlandria
Arlandria
Oh God you gotta make it stop
My sweet Virginia
I'm the same as I was in your arm
My sweet Virginia
I'm the same as I was in your arm
Shame
Shame
Go away
Come again
Some other day
Memories keep haunting me
Help me chase them all away
Hush, now, settle down
Button up
don't make a sound
Close your eyes
Turn around
Help me burn this to the ground
Come, now
Take the blame
That's OK
I'll play the game
I don't care
It's all the same
Watch it all
Go up in flames
Use me up
Spit me out
Let me be your hand-me-down
Fame
Fame
Go away
Come again
Some other day
You used to say I couldn't save you enough
So I've been savin' it up
I started savin' it up
And when you said I couldn't give you enough
I started givin' you up
I started givin' you up
You are not me
Arlandria
Arlandria
You and what army
Arlandria
Arlandria
Oh God you gotta make it stop
My sweet Virginia
Oh God you gotta make it stop
My sweet Virginia
Oh God you gotta make it stop
