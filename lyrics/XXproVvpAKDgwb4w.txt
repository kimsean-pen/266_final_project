How 'bout you?
How 'bout you?

You took my love for granted
You left me lost and disenchanted
Bulldoze my heart as if you planned it
My prince was so unjustly handsome

Who was a knight in shining armor?
I coulda sworn you loved me harder
Might as well down this Caymus bottle
I ain't the type to play the martyr

How 'bout you get the fuck out?
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
Get the fuck out
(How 'bout you) take your tings and be on your merry way
Fly off with a wink, bye bye baby
How about you scusami Mimi'll call your valet
(You just) take your tings and be on your merry way

My friends all saw it in your eyes
They told me once, they told me twice
I looked beyond all the signs
I guess false love makes you blind, ay

Who was a knight in shining armor?
(You, you, you)
I coulda swore you loved me harder
(You, you, you)
Might as well down this Caymus bottle
(You, you, you)
I ain't the type to play the martyr

How 'bout you get the fuck out? (how about)
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
How about you get the fuck out?
(How 'bout you) take your tings and be on your merry way
(How 'bout you) fly off with a wink, bye bye, baby
(How 'bout you) scusami Mimi'll I'll call your valet
(How 'bout you) take your tings and be on your merry way
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
(Fuck out, fuck out)
(Get the fuck out)
Don't tell me these lies when you're bluffing
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
Go stay at your friend's house or something
Don't mean to be rude, but take your shit and leave
(How 'bout you)
Go stay at your friend's house or something
(How 'bout you)
Go and stay with your homeboy, he was talking to
(How 'bout you)
I ain't tryna be rude, but you're lucky
(How 'bout you)
I ain't kick your ass out last weekend

(How 'bout you) take your things and be on your merry way
(How 'bout you) fly off with a wink
Bye bye, baby
