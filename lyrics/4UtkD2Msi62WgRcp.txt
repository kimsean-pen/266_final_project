Glamourous stars darken the day
The shadows of night lighten their way
The wisdom of fools is not easy to learn
So go one step ahead and two in return

I am the sense in all of your tears
I am the reason of all of your fears

I am praised for my sadness
I am praised for my faults
I am praised for my madness
Cause some like it hot
And some like it cold

Evening calls the sunset to rise
I am a liar so take my advice
The wheel of fortune always goes round
Whatever goes up must always come down

I am the sense in all of your tears
I am the reason of all of your fears

I am praised for my sadness
I am praised for my faults
I am praised for my madness
Cause some like it hot
And some like it cold

Some like it cold
Some like it cold
Some like it cold
I am the cold
