You always take it back
Cause I always took my chances
Yes I've been running out
Never care of my fences
I've been away for days
It seemed like ages
In trouble I've been saved
But love ain't rising

I don't know if I can make it
I see love in double
Can't cause you trouble
I don't know if I still care
I still care
I still care

One day I'll stop running
Stop the joking, stop the laughing
I've been running out
My fences have been flooded

I don't know if I can make it
I see love in double
Can't cause you trouble
I don't know if I still care
I still care
I still care
