You're coming closer and closer to me
I feel your breathe - I feel your breathe
You think that you got it - know just what I need
Well let me see - well let me see
C'mon get me caught up
Let me see you take me down
Teach me a lesson
Right here - right now
Cause baby everything is right here - right here
C'mon spin my head round
Know what I'm talking'bout
Can you make my heart pound
Dizzy dizzy breakdown
If you got it let me know it I'm right here - right here
Blow me away - I wanna play with fire
Boy won't you take me and make me
Go crazy for you
Blow me away - then take me higher
C'mon and rock me and shock me
And make me love you
Blow me away - take me away
Don't make me wait - blow me away
Blow me away - take me away
Don't make me wait - blow me away
Boy you keep talking what you gonna do
Just make me see - just make me see
This is the moment you've been waiting for
The energy is calling me
C'mon get me caught up
Let me see you take me down
Teach me a lesson
Right here - right now
Cause baby everything is right here - right here
C'mon spin my head round
Know what I'm talking'bout
Can you make my heart pound
Dizzy dizzy breakdown
And you got it let me know it I'm right here - right here
Blow me away - I wanna play with fire
Boy won't you take me and make me
Go crazy for you
Blow me away - then take me higher
C'mon and rock me and shock me
And make me love you...
Take me so far away
Don't wanna wait another day
