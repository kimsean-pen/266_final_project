I don't even know what I'm doing here
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Little girl walkin down the street
Godverdomme, you gotta be with me
Well I know, you know
Everybody, everyone, let's go

Oh, baby, baby, you're so sweet
Ah, ah, wooo

Het leven is hard, de mensen worden bang
I'm so old, you're so young
I know, you know
Everybody, everyone, let's go

Oh, baby, baby, you're so sweet
Goddamn, ah, ah, whoa

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ik denk van ja, maar nee
Little girl, listen what I say
You know, I know
Everybody, everyone, let's go

Oh, baby, baby, you're so sweet
Whoooo
Ah, baby, baby, you're so sweet
Goddamn, ah, ah, whoa!
