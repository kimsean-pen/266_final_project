So tell me why
Why you're still here and I"m still here
And we're still taking time
Out of our busy life
Just to fuck around
Spewing words we both could live without (live without, live without, live without)

And tell me why
Why you're still here
And I'm still here
And we're still spending nights
Wasting half our life
Like fucking clowns
Running around this god forsaken town

I think I'll pass on the summer
Don't wanna fall for it this time
I'm drowning, drowning, drowning down
And, yeah, I might miss your mother
I fantasize about her sometimes
I'm drowning, drowning, drowning down

And there's nothing left to do
But let the waves crash over you

So tell me why
If I'm as bad as all those things you call me every night
You want me in your life just to drag around
I'm never living up to what you've thought you found

Ooh ooh oh oh
I think I'll pass on the summer
Ain't gonna work for me this time
I'm drowning, drowning, drowning down
And, yeah, I might miss your mother
But she knows what's the best when you're
Drowning, drowning, drowning down

But there's nothing left to do
But let the waves crash over you

So tell me why
Why you're still here
And I'm still here
And we're still taking time
Out of our busy life
Just to fuck around
Spewing words we both could live without

I think I'll pass on the summer
Don't wanna fall for it this time
I'm drowning, drowning, drowning down
And, yeah, I might miss your mother
But she can keep any dope she finds
Drowning, drowning, drowning down

And there's left nothing to do
But let the waves crash over you
(Yeah)
