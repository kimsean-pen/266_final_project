I've got a fire burning deep inside
Illuminates my way when there's no light
Whatever comes my way, I'll be alright
'Cause I've got that fire, fire, fire
Got that fire, fire, fire

Never was the type to fit in
Least likely to succeed
Never was the type to listen
Always marching to my own beat

Never had a doubt in my mind
Ain't got no quit in me
All I've got's a burning hunger
Cuts and bruises to remind me

Learned from my pain and heartache
Turned all that into fuel
All of the rage that I felt
Yeah, I put in my rear-view

Feel tall like the highest tower
There ain't no stopping me
All I've got's a burning hunger
And voices in my head, they're singing

I've got a fire burning deep inside
Illuminates my way when there's no light
Whatever comes my way, I'll be alright
'Cause I've got that fire, fire, fire
Got that fire, fire, fire

Stood on the edge of darkness
Felt my spirit breaking
Thought that there's no going back
My girl, my friends, and family saved me

Don't know if I picked the right path
Or where it's leading me
All I've got's a burning hunger
And voices in my head, they're singing

Whatever comes my way, I'll be alright
'Cause I've got that fire, fire, fire
Got that fire, fire, fire

I've got a fire, burning deep inside
A fire burning deep inside
I've got a fire, burning deep inside
A fire burning deep inside
I've got a fire
