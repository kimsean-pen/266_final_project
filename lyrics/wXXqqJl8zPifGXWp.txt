Anger he smiles, towering in shiny metallic purple armour
Queen jealousy, envy waits behind him
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground

Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted
They quietly understand
The once happy turquoise armies lay opposite, ready
But wonder why the fight is on

But they're all, they're bold as love
Yeah, they're all, they're bold as love
Yeah, they're all, they're bold as love
Just ask the axis

My red is so confident, he flashes trophies of war
And ribbons of euphoria
Orange is young, full of daring
But it's very unsteady for the first go round

My yellow in this case is not so mellow
In fact I'm trying to say it's frightened like me
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from
Giving my life to a rainbow like you

But I'm, I'm bold, I'm bold as love
Yeah, I'm bold, I'm bold as love
I'm bold, I'm bold as love
Just ask the axis

He knows, he knows, he knows
He knows everything

I'm, I'm bold, I'm bold as love, yeah
I'm bold, I'm bold as love, ohh
Been talkin' to ya
I'm bold, I'm bold as love, yeah.
