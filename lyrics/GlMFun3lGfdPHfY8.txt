Isn't she perfect?
Isn't she everything I need?
Isn't she worth it even if I can barely breath?

Now the days drag on and no one seems to care anymore
And we had our time, but now we're just dirty and bored

So you take and you take and you leave me dry
And you break to escape and you know I'm right
Not a day, not a day, not another night
You're so wonderful, you're so wonderful

Isn't this perfect?
Isn't this everything I need?
Damned if I'm worth it
Damned if I hold my breath to see

Now the days drag on and I don't even care anymore
And we had our fun, but now we're just dirty and bored
No one's listening!

So you take and you take and you leave me dry
And you break to escape and you know I'm right
Not a day, not a day, not another night
You're so wonderful, you're so wonderful

Isn't she perfect?
Isn't she everything I need?
Isn't she worth it even if I can barely breath?

So you take and you take and you leave me dry
And you break to escape and you know I'm right
Not a day, not a day, not another night
You're so wonderful, you're so wonderful
So you take and you take and you leave me dry
And you break to escape and you know I'm right
Not a day, not a day, not another night
You're so wonderful, you're so wonderful
So wonderful
