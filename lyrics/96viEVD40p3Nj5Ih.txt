The cogs keep turning
The earth keeps burning down
They gotta fuel the war machine
Curde oil and kerosene

A constant need a hate to feed
In a world that's bleeding out
Catastrophe epanastrophe
A never ending cycle
An enterprise built on lies
An eternal industry

For the wheels to turn
The world must burn
Burn it to the ground!

Always wanting more and more
Living the nightmare just to feed the dream
Spoiling the wealthy depriving the poor
Make war to fuel the machine

Filthy production, twisted destructive minds
Does it get you of?
Arm the troops it's feeding time

Devour!

Supply to demand
Create to destroy
Feed the fucking machine

Go!

Devour!

For the wheels to turn
The world must burn
Burn it to the ground!

Always wanting more and more
Living the nightmare just to feed the dream
Spoiling the wealthy depriving the poor
Make war to fuel the machine

A thirst for bloodshed the hungry man
Ever eternal war machine!

Unstoppable!

Stop this train
Let's derail the monster
The Iron Prince, cannot cease to breathe
Only flames can ignite the fire

Annihilating the War Machine
