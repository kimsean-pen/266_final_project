Nocturnal poetry:
Dressed in the whitest silver you'd smile at me
Every night I wait for my sweet Selene

But still...

Solitude's upon my skin
A Life that's bound by the chains of reality
Would you let me be your Endymion?

I would
Bathe in your moonlight and slumber in peace
Enchanted by your kiss in forever sleep

But until we unite
I live for that night
Wait for time
Two souls entwine

In the break of new dawn
My hope is forlorn
Shadows they will fade
But I'm always in the shade
Without you...

Serene and silent sky
Rays of moon are dancing with the tide
A perfect sight, a world devine

And I...

The loneliest child alive
Always waiting, searching for my rhyme
I'm still alone in the dead of night

Silent I lie with a smile on my face
Appearance deceives and the silence betrays

As I wait for the time
My dream comes alive
Always out of sight
But never out of mind

And under waning moon
Still I long for you
Alone against the light
Solitude am I

In the end I'm enslaved by my dream
In the end there's no soul who'd bleed for me

Hidden from daylight I'm sealed in my cave
Trapped in a dream that is slowly turning to nightmare,
Where I'm all alone
Venial is life when you're but a dream,
The book is still open the pages as empty as me

I cling to a hope that's beginning to fade
Trying to break the desolation I hate

But until we unite
I live for that night
Wait for time
Two souls entwine

In the break of new dawn
My hope is forlorn
We will never meet
Only Misery and me

This is my final call
My evenfall
Drowning into time
I become the night

By the light of new day
I'll fade away
Reality cuts deep
Would you bleed with me
My Selene?
