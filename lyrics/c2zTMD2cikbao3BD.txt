People are sayin'
That boy is gonna hurt you his kind of love is not for real
He's only playin'
Foolin' with your heart girl but I know how he makes me feel
And I don't need any other proof
They just don't understand
They don't know the truth

Momma says he's bad for me
Poppa says I'll be sorry
Everybody's talkin' my baby down
And all my friends doubt him
Tell me I should live without him
Everybody's talkin' my baby down

He's not like the others
Nobody wants to see it they don't even wanna try
Judge a book by it's cover
And you'll never know the story
There's so much more than meets the eye
Oh and I know his heart is true
I don't need anyone to tell me what to do

Momma says he's bad for me
Poppa says I'll be sorry
Everybody's talkin' my baby down
And all my friends doubt him
Tell me I should live without him
Everybody's talkin' my baby down

My sisters and my brothers
Tell me I should find another
Everybody's talkin' my baby down

Oh, but they can't feel his touch
They can't feel his kiss
They don't know what it's like to be loved like this
I don't care about their point of view
'Cause it's understood
When the love is good
Nothin' else is gonna do

(Momma says he's bad for me)
(Poppa says I'll be sorry)
Everybody's talkin' my baby down
And all my friends doubt him
Tell me I should live without him
Everybody's talkin' my baby down

My baby down, my baby down
Baby, baby down
Down, baby down
Down

(Momma says he's bad for me)
(Poppa says I'll be sorry)
Tell me my baby down
No they can't feel, no they don't care
My baby down

'Cause it's understood
When the love is good
Nothin' else is gonna do
No they don't care, no need care

They don't even wanna try
There's so much more than meets the eye
