Chase the light through shades
Arising moon ignites his ways
Failing to find a reasonable sign to crawl back
Walking through space and time
Where would you go when the dew of thought fails?
Chase the light through shades
Arising moon
Eyes will glow
Hearts will take
I'd close my eyes and feel the gaze
The gaze of life
Where would you go when the dew of thought fails?
Lose yourself
Hunted down
Choose to yield to higher grounds
Shoving off
Sweeping away
The moon lighting another way
