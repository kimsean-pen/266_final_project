Check this out, this warren g, y'know what I'm saying
Chilling wit my man slick rick, you know
And we gonna give you all a little tale about this jail stuff
You know, so rick, why don't you run it homie, yea

In the slammer kid but I'm innocent

Lord played witty wasn't having any pity
Now wit razor blades, did he
Cry suppose the situation seen mad eyes of foes
Drives a rolls, hey, yo, money, what size are those
Need to phone me toanothe sprang up, hm, to gang up
On the skid, housing the phone like he didn't know how to hang up
Would be hard though ought a minute or so and then yells time on a
And when you get your commisary, buy this and that or else I'm gonna
Be on that ass and won't stay off, extort, fig I say, way off
Beaten death, you ain't protecting me, forgot today's my day off
Hold my head and drift the? sumo weighing nuts and cars?
Instead of sitting here accumulating cuts and scars, behind bars

Dum ditty dum ditty ditty datty day
This type of shit happens every day
Take some punk locked up to get beat down, ripped down to his boots is broke
Dum ditty dum ditty ditty datty day
This type of shit happens every day
Riots, malay and disturbances of the peace

Mister slick rick let me take it for a second

And tell a short tale about the la county jail

9500 that was the lock up
When the lights got dim, it was time for the soccer
Jacking for the money, backstab was my mission
If a riot jumped out, it's time for incision
Sticking niggas here and sticking niggas there
I turn around and look and seen cops everywhere
Jacking brothers up, slapping brothers up
If you got blood on your clothes, lock up
High powered was the level, level fo'
Niggas sentenced to life and you can't be no ho
Or you can't tooken wit homies overlooken
As safe next door wit the puma straight cooking
Lighten up the whole module, hm
Godamn, yea, anothe squabble

Dum ditty dum ditty ditty datty day

This type of shit happens every day

Take some punk locked up to get beat down, ripped down to his boots is broke

Dum ditty dum ditty ditty datty day
This type of shit happens every day
Riots, malay and disturbances of the peace

One fight, the nigga trip, C.O. the rest he might scared
By couldn't squeal, I's like officer that nigga right there
Now if he ain't get me his friends will, needed a utensil
It turn out, I had to stab him in the eye with a pencil
State of shock, he made a yell, I said, now what you want traitor
CO puts me in the bin,
I see ya about a month later
Back in population, didn't matter that his friends tensed
The phone prints, the years added to the sentence
Still chilling and all of that and I escaped
When the damn thing sold, don't hit the sto' cause they made a rape attempt
Thank goodness, failed, call out next, he wail out
Here go the CO, Ricky Walters, back up, bailed out

The Co couldn't see the rape, the kid'll snitch mass figure

Fast trigger, you'll be back, you little bitch ass nigga
Au revare, back to dating sluts and stars
At least for now, no more accumulating cuts and scars
Behind bars
