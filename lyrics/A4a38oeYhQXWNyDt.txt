Evening's hymn
Conjures the park
And, now out of the dark
In a dream I followed you home
The crowds thinned out until we were alone
Waiting on some street I didn't know

When you heard a violin in the night
One room away
Did you wonder that wherever you were
One room away
He plays with only love
He plays with only love

So let your hands fall low, and turn your face to him
The festival is over, and the cypresses are bare
In the corridor, the face of God is smiling

When you heard a violin in the night
One room away
Did you wonder that wherever you were
One room away
How will you ever know
The dancer from the dance?
The dancer from the dance?
The curtain from the wind?

The festival is over
And the sea is in your eyes
On the promenade
The old Gods are returning

When you heard a violin in the night
One room away
Did you wonder that wherever you were
One room away

He plays with only love, he plays with only love
So let your hands fall low, and turn your face to him

The festival is over, and the cypresses are bare
In the corridor, the face of God is smiling

Evening's hymn
Conjures the park
And now, out of the dark
In a dream I followed you home
The crowds thinned out until we were alone
Waiting on some street I didn't know
