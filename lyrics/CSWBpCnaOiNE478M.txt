This is a problem
That'll stay with me till I RIP
This is a habit
Drugs were made for an addict like me

Close my casket
Send me to my grave
Bury me alive
I don't deserve this
I don't deserve this place

I've medicated myself again
I feel I'm killing my only friend
I've torn this world asunder
As I am slipping under

I'm seeing double
Everything is breaking away
My heart is pounding
Out my chest and punches my face

So close my casket
Put me in my grave
Bury me alive
I don't deserve this
I don't deserve this place

I've medicated myself again
I feel I'm killing my only friend
I've torn this world asunder
As I am slipping under
Under, under, under

Yeah, yeah
I'm going insane
Sane, sane, sane, sane, sane

I'm going in
Sane, sane, sane, sane, sane
I'm going in
Going insane

I've medicated myself again
I feel I'm killing my only friend
I've torn this world asunder
As I am slipping under

I've medicated
I feel I'm killing
I've torn this world asunder
As I am slipping under

I'm going in
I'm going in
Going insane
