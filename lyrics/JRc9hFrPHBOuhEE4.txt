I'm not gonna live a lie just for your entertainment
We started this stupid game but all the rules have changed again
If I was stranger would I be safer?
Who do you want me to be to love, to hurt, to trust?

I'm not gonna fall apart to get your attention
I know what I want but it's not an addiction
Whoa oh oh oh, I've only got the truth
Whoa oh oh oh, is that enough for you?
I see through your empty affection
I know who I am I can face my reflection
Whoa oh oh oh, I've only got the truth
Whoa oh oh oh, Whoa oh oh

Under the microscope see all the imperfections
You wanna be so close to all the dirt and grime, but why?
If I were a danger would that amaze ya?
Is that who you want me to be to love, to hurt, to trust?

I'm not gonna fall apart to get your attention
I know what I want but it's not an addiction
Whoa oh oh oh, I've only got the truth
Whoa oh oh oh, is that enough for you?
I see through your empty affection
I know who I am I can face my reflection
Whoa oh oh oh, I've only got the truth
Whoa oh oh oh, Whoa oh oh

Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh
We started this stupid game
Maybe I'll take some blame but I can't take it all

I'm not gonna fall apart to get your attention
I know what I want, know what I want
Whoa oh oh oh, I've only got the truth
Whoa oh oh oh, is that enough for you?
I see through your empty affection
I know who I am I can face my reflection
Whoa oh oh oh, I've only got the truth
Whoa oh oh oh, Whoa oh oh

Whoa oh oh, Whoa oh oh
I've only got the truth
Whoa oh oh oh, Whoa oh oh
