i'm just looking
just looking for a way around
it disappears this near
you're the rod i'm water
i'm just looking for the divine hammer

one divine hammer
one divine hammer

i'm just looking for one divine hammer
i'd bang it all day
oh the carpenter goes bang
bang bang
i'm just looking for one divine hammer

one divine hammer
one divine hammer

i'm just looking for a faith
waiting to be followed
it disappears this near
you're the rod i'm water
i'm just looking for one divine hammer

one divine hammer
divine hammer
