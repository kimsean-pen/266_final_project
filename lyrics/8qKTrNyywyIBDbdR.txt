The figures that guide me have fallen apart
With nothing to follow my head is so hollow
How am I meant to be free when these chains are dragging on my feet?
Bounding me to the bottom of the sea
I'm starting to believe I'm the one who walked away
You know this attraction is fake
When the arms around you are filled with hate
I've watched your sky fall down upon you so many times

Now everything in this world is dead
I'm holding on to something you'll regret

Now everything in this world is dead
I'm holding on to something you'll regret

And now I can see you for you are
Someone that drowns me out
So when we look back on what we had
How could you leave me here so helpless?
Wake me up

This can't be anything we've ever wanted
You were there from the start
Where are you now?
Raise me up
Wake me up
Raise me up
Wake me up

Everything in this world is dead
Everything in this world is dead

And now I can see you fro who you are
Someone that drowns me out
So when we look back on what we have
How can you leave me so helpless?
Wake me up

You said you'd never leave but you proved me wrong
You said you'd never leave but you proved me wrong
