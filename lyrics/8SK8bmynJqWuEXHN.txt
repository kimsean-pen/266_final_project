Funny how every time you push me away.
You turn around and you beg me to stay.
Cut down from the things you say.

It's the beating of, a broken drum.
Na, na, nana
Hey, hey
Na, na, nana

Hey, hey, hey

One of these days you'll push me away.

Turn around, it'll be too late.
Your love is addictive.

I'm trying hard, just to quit it,
but you're drowning yourself.

You won't catch your breath until you admit it.
Is anybody out there?
I'm dying in a nightmare.

You've got third degree burns and now it's your turn to feel what I, feel, yeah.
And if it don't hurt then you know what we got ain't real.
Funny how every time you push me away.

You turn around and you beg me to stay.

Cut down from the things you say.
It's the beating of, a broken drum.
Na, na, nana
Hey, hey
Na, na, nana
Hey, hey, hey
One of these days you'll push me away.
Turn around, it'll be too late.
This love is a monster, it's eating me alive.
Let go of my hand, you don't give a damn and it's killing me inside.
You show me no mercy.
Did God make a mistake?
Put a hole in your heart and then you can start to feel what I, feel.
If it don't hurt then you know what we got ain't real, yeah.
Funny how every time you push me away.
You turn around and you beg me to stay.
Cut down from the things you say.
It's the beating of, a broken drum.
Na, na, nana
Hey, hey
Na, na, nana
Hey, hey, hey
One of these days you'll push me away.
Turn around, it'll be too late.
Where will you go when you refuse my benevolence?
It's funny how every time you push me away.
You turn around and you beg me to stay.
Everytime you push me away.
You turn around and you beg me to stay.
Cut down by the things you say.
I've had enough.
Where will you go when you refuse my benevolence?
Funny how every time you push me away.
You turn around and you beg me to stay.
Cut down from the things you say.
It's the beating of, a broken drum.
Na, na, nana
Hey, hey
Na, na, nana
