I medicate myself
Suspect that idols lie to me
I medicate myself
So that the world can lie to me

Words made out of dirt
Words made out of dirt
Words made out of dirt
You're dirt beneath my feet

I medicate myself
Suspect that idols lie to me
I medicate myself
So that the world can lie to me

Words made out of dirt
You're dirt beneath my feet
Words made out of dirt
You're dirt beneath my feet
