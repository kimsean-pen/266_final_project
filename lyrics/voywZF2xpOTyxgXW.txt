From hospitals to honesty
and everything you need of me,
I'll be there.
I'll be there.
From hospitals to honesty
and everything you need of me,
I'll be there.
I'll be there.
If this was your last chance
to say what you needed to
and give them every thought in a verse.
Could you stomach the hurt?
Could you stomach their healing word?
From hospitals to honesty
and everything that you need of me,
I'll be there.
My inspiration.
My guidance.
My home.
We think of you with love
and speak of you with pride.
Does your heart pull on your throat like mine?
I will try to live without you by my side.
I look up to the stars,
so you will forever see,
the best part of you still lives in me.
The north stands for nothing,
the true and the trusting.
The east's everlasting,
the cracked and the rusting.
The south is the salt that will seal your sores.
The west is the weakness,
the strength to defeat us.
The time took for granted,
the before and the after.
Your questions and your answers,
our courage, our cancer.
The time took for granted,
the before and the after.
Your questions and your answers,
our courage, our cancer.
