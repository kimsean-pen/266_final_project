I thought I could escape
all my tragic memories
I swept them under the rug and hoped
That they would disappear
But anger and pain
Always has it's grip on me
And I finally see that my demons
Are here to stay
I've got nowhere
Nowhere to hide from myself
When the past comes knocking
You gotta face it head to head
I've got nowhere
Nowhere to hide from myself
I gotta cope with all my demons
Before it finally gets to late
I bottled up my fears
Became a person in disguise
I move all around the world
I hope I wouldn't be recognized
But confusion al lies
Gets the best of me all the time
But with faith in my soul
I know that I can win this fight
I've got nowhere
Nowhere to hide from myself
When the past comes knocking
You gotta face it head to head
I've got nowhere
Nowhere to hide from myself
I gotta cope with all my demons
Before it finally gets to late
I've got nowhere
Nowhere to hide from myself
When the past comes knocking
You gotta face it head to head
I've got nowhere
Nowhere to hide from myself
I gotta cope with all my demons
Before it finally gets to late
I've got nowhere
Nowhere to hide from myself
When the past comes knocking
You gotta face it head to head
I've got nowhere
Nowhere to hide from myself
I gotta cope with all my demons
Before it finally gets to late
Nowhere to find
