You give me the reason, you give me control
I gave you my purity, my purity you stole
Did you think I wouldn't recognize this compromise?
Am I just too stupid to realize?
Stale incense, old sweat and lies, lies, lies

It comes down to this, your kiss, your fist, and your strain
It gets under my skin, within, take in the extent of my sin

You give me the anger, you give me the nerve
Carry out my sentence, will I get what I deserve?
I'm just an effigy to be disgraced, to be defaced
Your need for me has been replaced
And if I can't have everything, well, then just give me a taste

It comes down to this, your kiss, your fist, and your strain
It gets under my skin, within, take in the extent of my sin

You give me the reason, you give me control
I gave you my purity and my purity you stole
Did you think I wouldn't recognize this compromise?
Am I just too stupid to realize?
Stale incense, old sweat and lies, lies, lies

It comes down to this, your kiss, your fist, and your strain
It gets under my skin, within, take in, well, my sin
It comes down to this, your kiss, your fist, and your strain
It gets under my skin, within, take in the extent of my sin
