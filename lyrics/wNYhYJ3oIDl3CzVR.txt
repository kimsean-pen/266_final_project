Going to a life, a brand new life
Gonna try a life that won't be broken
Going to a life that feels good inside
Going to the night that's never over

Help help help me up
Keep moving, no slowing down
Help help help me up
Keep moving, no slowing down
Help help help me up
Keep moving, no slowing down
Help help help me up
Keep moving, no slowing down
Help help help me up

Here, here the lies, men who lies
Here black replies, they won't be spoken
Television eyes, they seem real lies
When somebody dies, they start it over

We're back to the front
We're living upside down
Do what you want
Until the rhythm runs out

Gonna try this skin, a brand new skin
Not the one I'm in, I'm moving over
Changes in the wind, but no one can win
All it's in the wind, they cut you open

Help help help me up
Keep moving, no slowing down
Help help help me up
Keep moving, no slowing down
Help help help me up
Keep moving, no slowing down
Help help help me up
Keep moving, no slowing down
Help help help me up

Lasers in the sky, been weak in the night
Keep us satisfied, so much to show you
I want to forget, but no one forgets
Everything is kept, so hallelujah

We're back to the front
We're living upside down
Do what you want
Until the rhythm runs out

We're back to the front
We're living upside down
Do what you want
Until the rhythm runs out

Want to bring this up
Want to fall down
Want to bring this up
Want to fall down
Want to bring this up
Want to fall down
Want to bring this up
Want to fall down
Want to fall down
Want to fall down
Want to fall down
Want to fall down
Want to bring this up
Want to fall down
Want to bring this up
Want to fall down

Help help help me up
Help help help me up
Help help help me up
Help help help me up
Help help help me up
Help help help me up
Help help help me up
Help help help me up
