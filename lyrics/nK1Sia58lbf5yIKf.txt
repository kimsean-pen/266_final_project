Flatline
I just wanna die, said I just wanna die sometimes
Prolly flatline
Have you ever made a wish and it doesn't come true
This time I'ma flatline

I just wanna die, said I just wanna die sometimes
Prolly flatline
Have you ever made a wish and it doesn't come true
This time I'ma flatline
Losin' everythin', includin' my god damn mind
I'ma flatline
Baby I'ma die, don't cry it'll be allright
I'ma flatline

Death is rollin' through the wind
Hyper active like a kid without the ritalin
Sip fortys 'till I sink into my seat
Transportation elevate so I can feel my feet, no
Cloudy in my head
I think the lighter fluid lit my lucid visions from my bed
I sit and ponder 'bout the water that I'm drinkin' from my sink
Will it calcify and justify the feelings that I think
Prolly not
But that's a fuckin' headline
Headin' to the shore
Without a cure for all my deadlines
Subtweeting my enemies but they're just merely enzymes
I know that you love me but you love him too and that's fine
(Not really but...)

I should prolly go
Sippin' up my cup
And spark a blunt under the snow
Wow, I just blew an O
Step into a portal
I'm immortal
Now the goat
And then I flatline

I just wanna die, said I just wanna die sometimes
Prolly flatline
Have you ever made a wish and it doesn't come true
This time I'ma flatline
Losin' everythin', includin' my god damn mind
I'ma flatline
Baby I'ma die, don't cry it'll be allright
I'ma flatline
