Stone broke, it's all just a joke
You're burning all your money
And you're breathing the smoke

Your eyes shine, the women decline
But only 'cause you've crossed the line

Sink, swim, oh, where to begin?
You're never gonna get it 'cause you always give in
You're spoon fed and out on the edge
So when you gonna put your devils to bed?

Boy! What you looking for?
When the worlds in the palm of your hand
And what's the crying for?
About the lows in your life that you never had
So don't justify
You're so broke inside
You're running like a blind man
With your hand on your heart
Swearing never again

No shame, you did it again
Your take my umbrella while I stand in the rain
The last time I give you mine
You knew it when you crossed the line

Sink, swim, oh, where to begin?
You're never gonna get it 'cause you always give in
You're spoon fed and out on the edge
So when you gonna put your devils to bed?

Boy! What you looking for?
When the worlds in the palm of your hand
And what's the crying for?
About the lows in your life that you never had
So don't justify
You're so broke inside
You're running like a blind man
With your hand on your heart
Swearing never again

You don't care
It's cold out there
You don't mind
Anytime
You don't care
It's cold out there
You don't mind
Anytime

What you looking for?
When the worlds in the palm of your hand
And what's the crying for?
About the lows in your life that you never had
So don't justify
You're so broke inside
You're running like a blind man
With your hand on your heart
Swearing never again

Boy! What you looking for?
When the worlds in the palm of your hand
And what's the crying for?
About the lows in your life that you never had
So don't justify
You're so broke inside
You're running like a blind man
With your hand on your heart
Swearing never again
