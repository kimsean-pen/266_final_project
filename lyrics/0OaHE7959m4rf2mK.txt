I see forever
When I look in your eyes
You're all I've ever wanted
I always want you to be mine

Let's make a promise
To the end of time
We'll always be together
And our love will never die

So, here we are face to face and heart to heart
I want you to know we will never be apart
Now, I believe that wishes can come true
'Cause when I see my whole world
I see only you

When I look into your eyes
I can see how much I love you
And it makes me realize
When I look into your eyes
I see all my dreams come true
When I look into your eyes

I've looked for you all of my life
Now that I've found you
We will never say good-bye
Can't stop this feelin'
And there's nothing I can do
'Cause I see everything
When I look at you

When I look into your eyes
I can see how much I love you
And it makes me realize
When I look into your eyes
I see all my dreams come true
When I look into your eyes

O-o-oh!
When I look into your eyes
I can see how much I love you
And it makes me realize
When I look into your eyes
We will always be together
And our love will never die
When I look into your eyes
I see all my dreams come true
When I look into your eyes
When I look into your eyes
