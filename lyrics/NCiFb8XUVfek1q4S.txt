She's a killer
And she's a keeper

Am I blurry, in your vision
Was I just, a poor decision
Cut me open, with precision
And my finger in the incision
Tell me what have I done
(Quid pro quo)
To watch you lose control

I will give you sanctuary
In these hymns of Thanatos
I will give you sanctuary!

You want to see me burn
I am living fire!
You want to see me burn
I am living fire!

You will know me
By the scars I bare
You will know me
By the hate I swear
You will know me
By the scars I bare
Shapeless, vengeance!

We are the thousand
Children of death
We're in-between, on the fence
Non-descript antagonists
I'm in-between, on the fence
Non-descript antagonist!

I'll split you open
And climb inside
Lose myself
Eaten alive

We are the thousand
Children of death
From Seraphim
To Nephilim, Exodus

She's picking ghostflowers
From her soul
She's clipping the wings
Of fallen angels
She's picking ghostflowers
From her soul
She's tonguing splinters
Of broken halos

You will know me
By the scars I bare
You will know me
By the hate I swear
You will know me
From the scars I bare
You will know me!

From gelatin
To specimen
To emptiness

I will be avenged
I will be avenged

These are the secrets
That kill that kill that kill
That kill that kill that kill
That kill that kill that kill
That kill that kill

We are the thousand
Children of death
