Unreal
As I fight back
My heart is telling me
I just cannot settle everything
Now my chance
I can't back down now
Got to keep moving
And nothing's gonna change my mind
I am the one, You call the enemy
Who you're trying to eliminate
All I hear is breaking me down
I gotta go on, I'm gonna step it up now

You use to call me a hero
Now I am standing alone
Am I almighty
Living in a danger zone
It is a countdown to zero
You call me misunderstood
I'm high on fire
In the danger zone

I kneel, Let it all out
I lack adrenaline
Back me up and give me everything
Will return, A sneak attack
I promise you that
You are gonna handle dynamite
M.I.A. A victim, a prophet
A man, and a game
Trying to discriminate
What I say, Is building me up now
There's my way, the highway, or Destiny

You use to call me a hero
Now I am standing alone
Am I almighty
Living in a danger zone
It is a countdown to zero
You call me misunderstood
I'm high on fire
In the danger zone

Danger
It's dangerous
I am out of control
Will I ever return
And it burns
Til I open my eyes
Danger - Dangerous

I fear what I'd become
I see the danger in
Falling back to giving everything
All away, I've fought it back now
Always on the run
Living in a danger zone
I am alone, I am invisible
To the forces of duality
All I want is what I can't get now
Gotta get up and gotta get away now

You use to call me a hero
Now I am standing alone
Am I almighty
Living in a danger zone
It is a countdown to zero
You call me misunderstood
I'm high on fire
In the danger zone
