Something's happening
Don't speak to soon
I told the boss off and made my move
Got no where to go

Son of Sam, son of that shining path, the clouded mind
Couple killer each and every time

I'm not uncomfortable, feeling weird
Long revered options disappear
But I know what to do

Son of Sam, son of a doctor's touch, a nurse's love
Acting under orders from above

King for a day

Son of Sam, son of that shining path, the clouded mind
Couple killer running out of time

Shiva opens her arms now
To make sure I don't get too far
I may talk in my sleep tonight cause I don't know what I am
I'm a little like you, more like Son of Sam
