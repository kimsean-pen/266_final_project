Your shouts are as quiet as a whisper now.
All that's left is this ringing in my ears.
Nothing you could every say is loud enough to resonate.
This is something I call letting go.

For all this time I spent thinking about you,
I was better off not thinking at all.
So goodbye, forget these words I never meant.
I'll get by just fine on my own.

Between you and me, I never was the on to speak too loud.
Things have changed now.
Nothing that you ever said is something I remember,
no matter how loud you screamed.

Softly, so softly, I hear an echo fading out so far away.
