At night it hits me cold
There's so much more to life than I'll every know
I look around and I realise
it's time to make a move though you don't sympathise
Stars collect overhead
They look down over China and I might as well be dead
Cars pass on through the night
How do you get to heaven if you never try?

New life, new love
Where's the heart I was dreaming of?
I need a new hope, new dream
another part in a different scene

Make a firm decision it's time to go
That's for you to find out and for me to know
No more hard times or petty crimes
Forget that life I have left behind
The night goes by
leaving you behind me as I fly
then rise the daylight sky
How do you get to heaven if you never try?

New life, new love
Where's the heart I was dreaming of?
I need a new hope, new dream
another part in a different scene

A new life, it's so hard to find
A new love, it's so hard to find

The night goes by
leaving you behind me as I fly
then rise the daylight sky
How do you get to heaven if you never try?

New life, new love
Where's the heart I was dreaming of?
I need a new hope, new dream
another part in a different scene
