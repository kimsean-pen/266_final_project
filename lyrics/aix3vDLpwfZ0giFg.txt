Madness is my old friend
We don't need fancy drinks and penthouse suites to run awry
And you, you just were just a fling
A beautiful addition to the valley of my vices

We're different people
Adam and Evil, oh
Dreaming alone
You smiled at the sunrise
Longed for a last night
Baby you know

The diamond days are done
The diamond days are gone
And I would be a fool to carry on
And know there's nothing wrong
But I'm already gone
Like headlights in the dawn, we've had our fun
The diamond days are done

Pearls hang around my neck
You tie a noose on me with every gift a velvet coffin
Done, mile high and dry
I pray to hell's angels that we crash in the vanilla sky

We're different people
Adam and Evil, oh
Dreaming alone

The diamond days are done
The diamond days are gone
And I would be a fool to carry on
And know there's nothing wrong
But I'm already gone
Like headlights in the dawn, we've had our fun
The diamond days are done
The diamond days are done

Madness is my old friend
We don't need fancy drinks and penthouse suites to run awry

The diamond days are done
The diamond days are gone
And I would be a fool to carry on
The diamond days are done
The diamond days are done
The diamond days are done
The diamond days are done
The diamond days are done
