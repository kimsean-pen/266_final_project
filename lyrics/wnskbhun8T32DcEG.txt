When you raise your pencil skirt
like a veil before my eyes,
like the look upon his face
as he's zipping up his flies.

Oh I know
that you're engaged to him.
Oh but I know that
you want something to play with baby.

I'll be around when he's not in town,
I'll show you how you're doing it wrong,
I really love it when you tell me to stop.
Oh it's turning me on.

You can tell me some lies
about the good times that you've had,
but I've kissed your mother twice
and now I'm working on your dad.

Oh baby,
I'll be around when he's not in town,
I'll show you how you're doing it wrong,
I really love it when you tell me to stop.
Oh it's turning me on.

If you look under the bed
then I can see my house from here,
so just lie against the wall
and watch my conscience disappear

Now baby
I'll be around when he's not in town,
I'll show you how you're doing it wrong,
I really love it when you tell me to stop.
Oh it's turning me on.

I only come here
cause I know it makes you sad yeah.
I only do it
cause I know you know it's bad.
Oh yes I know that it's ugly
and it shouldn't be like that, oh
but it's turning me on
