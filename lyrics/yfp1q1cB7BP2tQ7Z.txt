Strange man, strange man
Why won't you leave me alone
Cause the next time you'll be here I'm gonna walk, I'm gonna walk out, and lock my door
Your soul is what you make it, that is everywhere you go
I could never make you love it and I could never change, Your soul is what you make it that is everywhere you go
I could never make you love it and I could never change, Your soul is what you make it that is everywhere you go

Strange day, strange day
Why won't you leave me alone
Cause the next time you'll be here I'm gonna walk, I'm gonna walk out, lock my door
Your soul is what you make it that is everywhere you go
I could never make you love it and I could never change, Your soul is what you make it, that is everywhere you go
I could never make you love it and I could never change, Your soul is what you make it that is everywhere you go
