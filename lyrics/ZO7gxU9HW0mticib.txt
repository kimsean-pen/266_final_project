That girl is a tomboy!
That girl is a tomboy!

Who that is, hoe?
That girl is a tomboy!

That girl is a tomboy!

With my little titties and my phat belly
I could take your man if you finna let me
It's a guarantee that he won't forget me
My body little, my soul is heavy
My little titties be bookin' cities all around the world
They be fucking wit' me
I'm a Calvin Klein model, come and get me
Sip the [?] up, don't be fucking with me
My little titties are so itty bitty
I go locomotive, chitty chitty, bang bang
Gold hoops and that name chain
Timb boots and like, four rings
Missy Elliott, can't stand the rain
You lames playing the same games
Little titties, I'm so damn pretty

Staircase and a crack philly
Little titties and a fat kitty
Big pants and some stuffed shoes
Pow-pow-pow, Blue's Clues
(Pow pow pow! Pow pow!)

With my little titties and my phat belly
My little titties and my phat belly
My little titties and my phat belly
(That girl is a tomboy)
My little titties and my phat belly
My little titties and my phat belly
My little titties and my phat belly
(That girl is a tomboy)
My little titties and my phat belly
(My little titties and my phat belly
My little titties and my phat belly)
That girl is a tomboy

That girl is a tomboy
That girl is a tomboy
Who that is, hoe?
That girl is a tomboy!
That girl is a tomboy!
That girl is a tomboy!

Who that?

Princess Nokia, Baby Phat

Who know how to shake it fast
We gon' spit that brazy track
You know that I'll take it back
I'm spitting the illest math
Yeah, hoe!

Who that?

Princess Nokia, make it clap
She with it to set it back

And give ya the fire track
Now watch what gon' happen next

Who that up in the North?
Dennis Rodman up court
When I step up in the function it's a party, of course
I'm having fun with my friends
And I don't want it to end
And if you finna blow my high then I'ma punch you again

With my little titties and my phat belly
My little titties and my phat belly
My little titties and my phat belly
(That girl is a tomboy)
My little titties and my phat belly
My little titties and my phat belly
My little titties and my phat belly

He so in love
He think it's a spell
This love is too magic and he cannot tell
He fuck with my bruja, my pussy and spell
My toto is special, got locks like a jail
It's Polo, it's Tommy, it's Mecca, it's Nauti
I'm finna sit back and just sip on Bacardi
You come to my party
You gon' meet my army
A room full of girls and we acting real rowdy
