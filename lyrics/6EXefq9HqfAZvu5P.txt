Venomous by design
Lying idle, biding time
Bore down the clutch, tore up the road
Six hundred horses, genetic code
Lightning speed, the road she bends
Slammed down the brakes, losing my ass end

Drive on
Pushed to the limit
My Viper King, we're flying high
Drive on
Filled with desire
Nothing to fear, I feel alive
My Viper King

Speed demon, tempting fate
Do or die, in the blink of an eye

Drive on
Pushed to the limit
My Viper King, we're flying high
Drive on
Filled with desire
Nothing to fear, I feel alive
My Viper King

Drive on
Pushed to the limit
My Viper King, we're flying high
Drive on
Filled with desire
Nothing to fear, I feel alive
My Viper King
My Viper King
My Viper King
