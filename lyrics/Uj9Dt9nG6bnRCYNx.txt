You gotta let up

Hallucinate
Dream space
An effigy
Shadow play
Harmonize
No escape
Pressurize,
everybody now, 'till they say

Sound it out
Sound it out
Sound it out
Sound it out

She's gone crazy

For real,
or just me?
She's addressed,
but can she sing?
Where's the truth,
in the tongue?
Pressurize,
everybody now, 'till they say

Sound it out
Sound it out
Sound it out
Sound it out

She's gone crazy

You gotta let up,
or you're headed for a breakdown
You gotta let up,
or you're headed for a breakdown

You gotta let up,
or you're headed for a breakdown
You gotta let up,
or you're headed for a breakdown
You gotta let up,
or you're headed for a breakdown
You gotta let up,
or you're headed for a breakdown
