She gave you
Everything she had
But she was young
And dumb,
She'd just turned twenty one.

She didn't care
To hang around
So when the shit came down
Why she was nowhere
To be found.

This life can turn
A good girl bad
She was the sweetest thing
That you had ever seen.

You're such a delicate boy
In the hysterical realm
Of an emotional landslide
In physical terms.

With your cherry lips
And golden curls,
You could make grown
Men gasp
When you'd go walking past.

And in your hotpants
And high-heels
They could not believe
That such a body was for real.

It seemed like rainbows
Would appear
Whenever you came
Near the clouds would disappear.

Because you looked
Just like a girl
Your baby blues would flash
And suddenly a spell was cast.

You're such a delicate boy
In the hysterical realm
Of an emotional landslide
In physical terms.

You hold a candle
In your heart,
You shine a light on
Head and heart.

You make the whole world
Wanna dance,
You've bought yourself
A second chance.

Go baby, go-go...
We're right behind you;
Go baby, go-go...
Yeah, we're looking at you.

Go baby, go-go...
Oh, we're right behind you;
Go baby, go baby...
Yeah, we're right behind you.

Go baby, go baby...
Oh, we're right behind you;
Go baby, go baby,
Yeah, we're looking at you.

Go baby, go baby...
Oh, we're right behind you;
Go baby, go baby...
Yeah, we're looking at you.

You hold a candle
In your heart...
(go baby, go-go...)

You shine a light on
Head and heart...
(go baby, go-go).

You make the whole world
Wanna dance...
(go baby, go-go...)

You've bought yourself
A second chance...
(go baby, go baby, go).

Delicate boy...
(go baby, go baby, go...)
In the hysterical realm...
(go baby, go baby, go).

Of an emotional landslide...
(go baby, go baby, go...)
In physical terms...
(go baby, go-go... go).

Yeah, we're looking at you,
Go baby, go-go...
Oh, we're right behind you.
