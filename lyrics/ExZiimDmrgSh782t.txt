Hell's goin' with you, ridin' on your back
All mist and terror, with all self pain in black
Fields of depression, the wounds that never mend
The final solution, bring it to an end

To an end
To an end

Inside this world of pain, your beliefs of suicide
Denial and repression, psychopathic pride
Iron determination, a will that cannot bend
The final solution, bring it to an end

To an end
To an end

Suffering and sorrow, the casualties of war
Spirit has broke me, broke forevermore
Pure assassination, the machine it rolls again
The final solution, bring it to an end

To an end
To an end
