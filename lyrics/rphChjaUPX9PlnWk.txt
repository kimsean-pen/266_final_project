Destiny, feel disgrace.
I'm the one that's fallen.
I'm the one in pain.
I'm the one that's going.
Forces decay in pain,
By the light.

The suffer is cold.
There's colors
Searing his face.

Drifting through the sorrow.
The visions yet display.
It strips the soul completely empty.
Sirens rage in vain.
Drifting through the sadness.
Violence fills the sky.
Torturing, the voice rang out.
My servants they are blind,
By the light.

Suffer is cold.
There's colors
Searing his face.

By the light!
By the light!
By the light!
