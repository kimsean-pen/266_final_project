Ah, come on
Ooh, who me?
Come on, uh

I saw you outside
Getting out your ride
A CLK 430, you've got style
As soon as I checked you out
A ladies man no doubt
From head to toe you're all style I like it

How bout you buy me a rose 'cause I think
This is gonna get a little interesting
Let's see where this conversation goes
I'm not sure that I want you to know

I wish I could right now
Wish that I could show you how
I'm feeling you (I'm feelin' you)
Boy I try I can't hide (can't hide)
How badly I want you tonight
I've gotta fight it

If you take me home
Get me all alone
Nothing could happen it's just too soon
I'm just being upfront
Telling you from the jump
Not tonight I'm not that type of girl (I'm sorry)

If I gave you the wrong impression I
Apologise from the bottom of my heart
I'm talkin' out my head, probably misled you
I'm confused and I'm a little scared

I wish I could right now (could right now)
Wish that I could show you how
I'm feeling you
Boy I try I can't hide (ooh, whoa)
How badly I want you tonight
I've gotta fight it (gotta fight it, baby)

I wish I could right now
Wish that I could show you how (wish that I could show you how)
I'm feeling you (oh-whoa)
Boy I try I can't hide
How badly I want you tonight
I've gotta fight it

My bodies playin' tricks on me
I'm just not thinkin' clearly
This has happened too quickly, I've got to slow down
Tomorrow is another day
This I promise if you say
That it doesn't matter, everything is gonna be okay

Slow down (hmm, okay)
Come on (I wish)

I wish I could right now (I wish I, I wish)
Wish that I could show you how
I'm feeling you
Boy I try I can't hide (oh, yeah)
How badly I want you tonight (I want you tonight)
I've gotta fight it

I wish I could right now
Wish that I could show you how (if you only knew)
I'm feeling you
Boy I try I can't hide
How badly I want you tonight
I've gotta fight it

I wish I could right now (baby)
Wish that I could show you how (show you how)
I'm feeling you (I'm feeling you)
Boy I try I can't hide
How badly I want you tonight
I've gotta fight it

I wish I, could show you
Boy I try, I want you
