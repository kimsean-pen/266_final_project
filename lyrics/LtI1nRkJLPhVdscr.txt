There is one course to take
There is one war to fight
Be victorious or die
Only one siege to gain
There's fire in our eyes
Let his kingdom rise

He holds the fate of our kingdom in his hands
Wide open gates, attack to foe, then raid their land

We are the warriors
We march through halls
Edge of steel
We are rebellions
We tear down walls
Edge of steel
We draw the bow
The javelins swing
We serve the king
The edge of steel

We abide, we serve the king
His reign of steel

He holds his sword up high
Unshakable his will
Warriors unite
We see black ravens fly
There's fire in the sky
Helm and axe in sight

He holds the fate of our kingdom in his hands
Wait, stem to stem attack the foe, they sink to sands

We are the warriors
We march through halls
Edge of steel
We are rebellions
We tear down walls
Edge of steel
We draw the bow
The javelins swing
We serve the king
The edge of steel

We abide, we serve the king
His reign of steel

Protected by Finn's invincible spell
Iron-shielded vessels sail

We are the warriors
We march through halls
Edge of steel
We are rebellions
We tear down walls
Edge of steel
We draw the bow
The javelins swing
We serve the king
The edge of steel

We are the warriors
We march through halls
Edge of steel
We are rebellions
We tear down walls
Edge of steel
We draw the bow
The javelins swing
We serve the king
The edge of steel
