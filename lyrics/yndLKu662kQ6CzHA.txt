Another emergency truck keeps rolling fast
Two lane highway and they run on the wrong track
You still don't know that you're never going back
You're going to the science hospital
You guess that your body is still alive
They estimate you're in pretty good health
Good shape for some of our sadistic tests
Doctor said you must stay in bed
Surgical scourge on you
Surgical scourge on you
Electric shock through you
Electric shock through you
Feel the scalpel they cut you with
Going into the experimental room
How much radiation can your body stand?
You did very well, you'll feel better soon
The red cross is turning black
Wake up in another department
You see the nurse with blood on her clothes
They got another experience for today
Maybe the worst of them
Diagnosing the pain, the ravenous medicine
Discovering the cure, the ravenous medicine
Died through illness, the ravenous medicine
Don't care how many organs you gave
Injecting the drugs
'Till you become the slave
Turn off the machine that keeps your heart beating
They're gonna do it to you!
