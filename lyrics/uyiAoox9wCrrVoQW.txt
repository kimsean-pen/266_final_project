On Satur(n)days we used to sleep
All motionless and still
While shrouded in an oppressive gloom
We're handed over to the dream
A sleep so dark, this "Moon by Day"
Of powers strange and weird
Through mystic veils
Her silver rays
Are glowing carefully
Woven of dewdrops and magical light
This gown that we're wearing here
Is but a cloth of mist and we used to call it
"Breath of the Other Sphere"

We are floating, flying, incredibly fast
The world of the thought gives birth to this life
Free to remember, to discover and feel
As were closely together in our parallel flight
While beyond the gates our bodies lie
Next to each other in fragile rest
Two chests are lifted up and down
Moved only by some mortal breath
Yes, our bodies are sleeping so closely together
But it's only in our minds that we touch
In the realm of the spirit(s) our souls become one

In the happy knowledge that we are completing halves

No bodies and no barriers
Far more intimate and strange
Our understanding is clearer, incomparably real
Although there is no sound that dares to escape
His eyes are mirrors, gates to his soul
One true look and I recognize
That it's him
My husband
The one that I love.
See me!
Read me!
Step inside!
No barriers and no masquerade
Come, be received beyond distress

So intensively and so deep
As our fingers unite, our hands caress

Two wanderers are lovingly dwelling this land
We fly side by side over mountains and glens
In the twilight lit of the silver moon
Set free from the flesh, released from this tomb

On Satur(n)days we used to sleep
The other side exploring, alive in our dreams
Free from the pain, home where we belong
Guarded by the shadows of the enchanted realm.
Below a violet sky, both dark and profound
The horizon is glittering, still there is no sound
We fly through the night crossing frontiers and lakes
Mountains and valleys
World without end
"This is where we truly belong
Take both my hands, look into my soul!"
I feel the strength of his embrace
As we're closely together in this secret place

"Hush, hush, my Dear
Can you hear the rustling in the Undergrowth?
See through the branches, there in the glade ..."
Ghostly creatures as they dance and sing
Their transparent bodies
Half man and half beast
Their voices so sweet like a soft breath of wind
On Satur(n)days we used to sleep
And my pain was eased by his love
