Tell me if it's real I don't know where I am
a cry in the silence
a shine in the dark

Stars are falling now
for once in my life
the future is mine

Lost, my words are lost in the dark
time for peace, there's no turning back

From a distant sky I call your name
like a cold eternal night with no fate
between space and time we live again
from a distant sky I call, I call your name

Shades of this memories are filling my dreams
no one understands the world I belong

Stars are falling down
for once in my life
the future is mine

Lost, my words are lost in the dark
time for peace, there's no turning back

From a distant sky I call your name
like a cold eternal night with no fate
between space and time we live again
from a distant sky I call, I call your name

Standing alone in a dream with no end
let's see how high you can fly my old friend
now face the changes, no fear and no pain
in death we will find where all this love has been gone
From a distant sky I call your name
like a cold eternal night with no fate
between space and time we live again
from a distant sky I call, I call your name
