I woke up lying in the dark
When I looked at you I knew
there was something real
Left over...
No more sleeping
you once said
That'll keep them to be
messin with our head
Always the one

You count to one
we'll knock em over
You sink to run
we knock em over

Take your hand
I'll make you run
Now which side of you
overlaps in front
We were holding back
back, back, back
You were tempting
from the start
I knew that you would
listen to my heart

This day ending
My mind bending
Home again. Everyone bye
Find them running.
Makes them so high
Find it back. Lone star...
Find it back...

Everyone you know is so high
Everyone you know will get by
So you wade into the light
I lost my soul again...
