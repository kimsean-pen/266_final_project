Hardly breathing, hardly breathing

I really wanna take you back
It's killing me watching you walk, away, yeah
But my head ain't okay with that
And lord knows how much I want you baby
It hurts me that you can't stay, ah

This old heart of mine won't let you break it
Not again, not again
It hurt so many times and I can't take it, not again
Cause I'm hardly breathing
One more teary eye, the sleepless nights
Just might kill this heart of mine
Hardly breathing, hardly breathing

Begging won't do nothing
Forgave you many times along the way
Yeah, yeah, ah,
My mama said don't trust him
But deep inside my soul I found
A place and now I want you out baby

This old heart of mine won't let you break it
Not again, not again
It hurt so many times and I can't take it, not again
Cause I'm hardly breathing
One more teary eye, the sleepless nights
Just might kill this heart of mine
Hardly breathing, hardly breathing

Feels like I'm on my last night, night,
And I can't take a chance, of not being able
To breathe again,
Another heartbreaker might lie inside
So I learned from the last time,
That loving you ain't worth those in my life

This old heart of mine won't let you break it
Not again, not again
It hurt so many times and I can't take it, not again
Cause I'm hardly breathing
One more teary eye, the sleepless nights
Just might kill this heart of mine
Hardly breathing, hardly breathing
Just might kill this heart of mine.
