I know
You've fallen again
The way I fell before
Cause I'm a bad loser
When you get your way

And I know that I'm chained
I'm chained again
And you've lost your way
To the bed that I once made

Cause I'm a bad habit
One you cannot shake
And I hope that I change
Don't follow me
Don't follow me

So if I go
Where the flowers grow
Into the deep below
Oh, would you forget me now?

Still small
Small voice of calm
Place the blame into my arms

Cause I'm a bad habit
One you cannot shake
Oh, Mary, mercy!
Would you pray for me?
Would you pray for me?

So if I go
Where the flowers grow
Into the deep below
Oh, would you forget me now?
And if I could
Make the days okay
Wash the stains away
Oh, would you forgive me now?

Cause I've made my mistakes
And I feel something's changed
And I know what's at stake
Wash the stains away

So if I go
Where the flowers grow
Into the deep below
Oh, would you forget me now?
And if I could
Take the pain away
Wash the stains away
Oh, would you forgive me now?

I've made my mistakes
And I feel something's changed
Wash the stains away
And I feel quite okay
