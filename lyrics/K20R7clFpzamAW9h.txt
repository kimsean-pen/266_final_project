Wake up
A voice hits the air on a lonely coast
And I'll sing along like a prayer for you
I can dream up the words
I'll never see your face again

If we wake at
If we wake at all
She sings to me
If we wake at
If we wake at all
We'll try to change

They say love will never mean a thing
Still our hearts beat
So come on
So stuck on the only thing that we know
What we know starts to waste

If we wake at
If we wake at all
She sings to me
Can we be sure
If we wake at
If we wake at all
Oh my God
