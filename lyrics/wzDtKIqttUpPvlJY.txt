Questions
I may not get the answers to tonight
But thats okay
I've got these little pleasures I can find

I can go for the weekend
Stay in with no one
Wake up whenever I like

Maybe dip into glitter
Kiss every mirror
Looking right into my eyes

Let's stare at each other
Let's stare at each other
Let's stare at each other
And fall in love
Let's stare at each other
Let's stare at each other
Let's stare at each other
And fall in love

Es lo que quiero
Es lo que quiero

Amor amor
So, ven y dame
Ven y dame

Amor amor
Es lo que quiero
Es lo que quiero

Amor amor
So, ven y dame
Ven y dame

Foolish
I've got a little temper thats alright
Don't we all put up with
And hush to sleep that little voice inside

Get away for the weekend
Tell it to no one
Wake up and wonder just why
Make sense of it monday
Right now its friday
Won't you look into my eyes

Let's stare at each other
Let's stare at each other
Let's stare at each other
And fall in love
Let's stare at each other
Let's stare at each other
Let's stare at each other
And fall in love
