The day since I met her
I - can't believe it's true
She came here from Memphis
Across the ocean sailing
And I saw her
And I pleaded
Why do you come so far?
And she said

Trying to get to you
How I tried to get you
Trying to get you

I'm sending a letter
I'll - send it right to you
I'll send it to Memphis
I know that someday
Everything I needed
And I wanted
Used to be that my head
Was haunted

And all these sirens
They make me mad
And all this violence
It brings me down
I feel strong
I feel lucky

Trying to get to you
Said I'm going to get to you
Trying to get to you
