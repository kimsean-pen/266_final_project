Bitches Crystal
Knows how you
Twist all the lines

Fortune teller
Future seller
Of time

Tortured spirits cry
Fear is in their eyes
Ghostly images die

Witches potion
Mixed in the ocean
Of tears

Mystical oowers
Emerge from the towers
Of fear

Tortured spirits cry
Fear is in their eyes
Ghostly images die

Evil learning
People burning
Savage casting
No one lasting

Witchcraft
Sadness
Madness
Turning in their minds

Evil learning
People burning
Savage casting
No one lasting

Witchcraft
Sadness
Madness
Turning in their minds

Ritual killings
That swear in
The shillings to be

Heretic priestess
Dwells on the
Weakness she sees

Tortured spirits cry
Fear is in their eye
Ghostly images die
