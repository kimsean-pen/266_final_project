Dig a hole,
in the middle of the street.
Dig it down,
Dig it down,
Six - feet - deep.

You should know,
what's really going down, below.
Dressed in their best clothes,
there are rows & rows & rows,

Of dead man's bones!
I'm talkin' 'bout dead man's bones!
Wherever you go,
take a look at your feet,
& down six feet deep
there's dead man's bones!

Bones! Bones! Bones, bones, bones, bones!

Dig 'em up, (Dig 'em up)
Dig 'em up, (Dig 'em up)
Take 'em home (Take 'em home)
Take 'em home (Take 'em home)
They've been livin' (They've been livin')
Six -feet - deep!

You should know,
for when down you go (Down you go!)
Dressed in their best clothes,
there are rows & rows & rows!

In the basement! (In the basement)
In the schoolhouse!
In the pavement!
In the water!
It's a sound, (underground!)
there's a sound! (underground!)
Six - feet - deep!

You should know,
that the world was built on bones.

Wherever you go,
take a look at your feet
down six feet deep
there's dead man's bones!
Bones! Bones! Bones, bones, bones, bones!
