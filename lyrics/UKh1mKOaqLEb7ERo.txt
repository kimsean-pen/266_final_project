Last night was a car crash
Highlights, made a quick end
Live the high life for the weekends
Coming down hard to the sunsets, sinking in
Didn't try hard for a die hard
Nothing I consider you, on getting wrong
And everybody ask, "Where you going now?"
Can you only really want what you don't have enough?
Everything you ever wanted adding up
You'd be the reason you can't stand, and now
You talk a lot, well, act like it
Finally found a way to get myself untangled
And I'm dumb, but it's alright
Listening and dreaming a long time
Make sure you play the music when my time's up
Ohh, today I'm done

So if you loved me, how was I supposed to know?
'Cause now we're fading and losing what we wanted most
But in spite of how you feel, it's not the end of the world
Some say these things are for the best
How are you so sure?

And you can find me where the sea pours into the stars
I'll get there someday
I hope you find everything you think that you want
Bruises will fade
Time on our side, we can wait for it

I'll be doing fine, if you are
'Cause life is but a dream
(Only it's still deceiving)

So if you loved me, how was I supposed to know?
And now we're fading, losing what we wanted most
But in spite of how you feel, it's not the end of the world
Some say these things are for the best
For better or worse
