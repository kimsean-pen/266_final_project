Sit still in the cold of February
Hold in my hand in the cemetery and you'll be safe
And I know that this is only temporary
And I don't think that it's helping anything

And it's all fun and games until someone gets fucked up
This will end in tears I could never be enough for you
Count my blessings on one hand and my curses on the other
I let you slip between my fingers
(Hide away until the summer)

Kali Ma lean over me
Rip your hand into my chest
Pull out my beating heart for the world to see
Then send me down to hell
You ignore my plea's
Indiana couldn't save me so I guess I'll save myself

We hop from bench to bench in the middle of our town
Where the street lights hit your eyes and then the tears came falling down
The love that you confessed, the product of your loneliness
I see right through you but what do I do?

Of course I fall for it
Just like I did when I was sixteen
Such a fool for you
Did you ever even miss me? (Doubt it)

Kali Ma lean over me
Rip your hand into my chest
Pull out my beating heart for the world to see
Then send me down to hell
You ignore my plea's
Indiana couldn't save me so I guess I'll save myself

Kali Ma lean over me
Rip your hand into my chest
Pull out my beating heart for the world to see
Oh won't you go to hell? (Go to hell)
(You gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory)
Maybe I, maybe I will (but not today!)
