You better think of something quick before I don't love you no more
Quick! Before I walk out that door
Quick! Before it all ends in jeers
What a waste of all those beers

You better think of something quick because my suitcase is packed
Quick! Because I'm through being attacked
Are you really prepared to lose
All this just to air your views?

We're on the brink of something
Get me a drink of something

Quick! Between your outrageous remarks
Like the mating calls of sarcastic sharks
Quick! Before you can't take that back
Just before it all goes black

You better think of something quick before the midnight bell chimes
You're living in dangerous times
Torture me for your amusement
About who will pay the rent

Who will pay the rent
Who will pay the rent
Who will pay the rent
Who will pay the rent
Who will pay the rent
