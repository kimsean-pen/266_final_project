I remember all the summer days
Drinking wine in the sunshine
I hope it never leaves
And I remember all the summer nights
Staring at you in the moonlight
I hope you never leave
Cause baby you're so good to me
You have all that I ever need.

It's easy to love you
So easy to love you
You know it's true
The best part of being with you,
To know you're with me
It's not so hard to say
It's easy to love you

I remember all those winter days
Frozen in the cold tryin' to get you home
Should I be moving in?
We can be together then
Remember spending all those winter nights
Stayin' inside by the warm fire
Ya you gotta know, I can never let you go
You and I have the rest of our lives to see

It's easy to love you
So easy to love you
You know it's true
The best part of being with you,
To know you're with me
It's not so hard to say
It's easy to love you

Can anybody else see it?
Oh, can anybody else see what I do?
Can anybody else feel it?
Oh, can anybody else feel the way I do?
Now I'm with you

Hard to forget all the moments when
We'd be sitting there hoping it would never end
Cause this is meant to be
So baby, will you marry me?

It's easy to love you
So easy to love you
You know it's true
The best part of being with you,
To know you are with me
It's not so hard to say
It's easy to love you

You and me will be together
I know our love will last forever
You and me will be together
I know our love will last forever
You know it's true
The best part of being with you
You're easy to love
