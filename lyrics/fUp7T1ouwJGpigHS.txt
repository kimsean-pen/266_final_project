A darker kind of love is what I give to this
A shadowed conversation on the edge of time
A final kind of crisis in the palm of my hands
A multiverse of conflict in my restless mind
You knew me as the one who spoke in passionate lies
The darker twin of someone that I used to know
The feelings like a cold imprinted on your blood now
The fire is directed at my soul until my eyes close again
Until I walk through the flames
See my eyes shut now
And my brain shut down
See my dark sunglasses
They hit the ground
See my legs shut down, down, down
You know me
