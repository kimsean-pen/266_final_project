Don't believe in everything you hear
Don't believe in everything you read
Don't believe in everything you see
Don't believe in me
Don't believe in anything you know
Don't believe there's somewhere you can go
Don't believe in anybody else
Don't believe in yourself

You say you want the world or nothing

What goes around will come around
And after all we'll all fall down
No one here is anyone
And in a while we'll all be gone

This is now
This is now
Here and now
Now

Don't believe in anything that's old
Don't believe in anything you're told
Don't believe in anything that's new
No one here believes in you
Don't believe that anybody cares
Don't believe that anything is there
Don't believe that anything's for real
Don't believe what you feel

You say you want the world or nothing

What goes around will come around
And after all we'll all fall down
No one here is anyone
And in a while we'll all be gone

This is now
This is now
Here and now
Now
War

Don't believe you'll find your way back home
Don't believe you'll find your way back home
Don't believe that you're something on your own
Don't believe that you're something on your own
Don't believe there's something you can do
Don't believe there's something you can do
Don't believe your dreams can come true
Don't believe your dreams can come true
Don't believe
Don't believe
