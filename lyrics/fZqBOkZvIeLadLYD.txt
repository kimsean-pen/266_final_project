Do you need?
Do you need someone?

Are you scared of what's to come?
If you leave then who will the next one be?
Will he do the same or will he let you see?

You don't have to hurt
You don't have to hurt anymore
With a little time take a look and find what you're searching for
You are broken on the floor
And you're crying crying
He has done this all before
But you're lying lying
To yourself that you find help
That he will change to someone else
But you're broken on the floor
Still asking him for more
Will you leave or will you carry on?
Is your love from before still strong?
If you leave will you keep the memory?
That made the night so long the cuts are deep

But you don't have to hurt
You don't have to hurt anymore
With a little time take a look and find what you're searching for
You are broken on the floor
And you're crying crying
He has done this all before
But you're lying lying
To yourself that you find help
That he will change to someone else
But you're broken on the floor
Still asking him for more
Oohooh, ooh, oohooh, ooh, oohooh, ooh
Asking him for more
Oohooh, ooh, oohooh, ooh, oohooh, ooh
Asking him for more
You are broken on the floor
And you're crying crying
He has done this all before
But you're lying lying
To yourself that you find help
That he will change to someone else
But you're broken on the floor
Still asking him for more
Oohooh, ooh, oohooh, ooh, oohooh, ooh
Asking him for more
More
Still asking him
For more
