You are a thunderous thing, wonderous king
The face of rival-less gods, deep in your thoughts
Come here, oh, closer to touch, never enough
Let me climb under your skin, oh let me in

From your lips, a precipice
I hang from every word

Height and seeking
Oh we are reaching
New heights and seeking
How to keep them high

The calm of turbulent seas, fallen to sleep
And when the troubles arise, we hold on tight
How can a body contain something so great
My shell may suddenly burst out will come birds

From your lips, a precipice
I hang on every word

Height and seeking
Oh we are reaching
New heights and seeking
How to keep them high

Height and seeking
Oh we are reaching
New heights and seeking
How to keep them high
Keep them high

We will find a way
We will find a way
We will find a way
We will find a way

And we are height and seeking,
Oh we are reaching
New heights and seeking
How to keep them high

Height and seeking
Oh we are reaching
New heights and seeking
How to keep them high (x3)

Keep them high
