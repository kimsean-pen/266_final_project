Lover don't you walk away
Near me always I would like you to stay
'Cause it looks like you're the same son
Loving don't have to be so hard
Look inside your stone-cold heart
And you see that I'm just like you

And if I was late then I'm sorry
And if I was you I'd be angry too
I'd be angry too but I'm not you

Look at me I try so hard
Just to be to be a part of oh you
And oh so odd something new
Yes, I would like to walk away
Near your bosom I would gladly stay
But I'm only base in what I do

And if I was late then I'm sorry
And if I was you I'd be angry too
I'd be angry too but I'm not you

But if was late then I'm sorry girl
And if I was you I'd be angry too
I'd be angry too but I'm not you
I'm not you
I'm not you

Loving me don't have to be hard
Oh darling start from the start
And you see that I'm the same son
