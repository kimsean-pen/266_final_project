Hold on
There is some
Believing to be done
Configure
The undertaking that is going on

Remember
It will always be formidable
The light is shining through

Keep the flame
Alive
In the dark
And understand
It burns for you
Through the dark

...And they who say
'You are still dying today'
Let them pray
It is a right
A privilege to st(r)ay away
