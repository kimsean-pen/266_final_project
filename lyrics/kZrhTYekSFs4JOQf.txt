what's the point of the leaves changing colors
if I can't watch them change with you?
you know that I'd do something just as drastic
to spend this fall with you
cause everyday that I spend without you
is just a waste of time
what's the point of going out for coffee
I don't want to drink it without you?
I'd give up everything I love to lie beside you cause
there's nothing I love close to you
everyday that I spend without you
is just a waste of time
