With a voice just like a razor
Only time can erase ya
The memory of you is unclear
In my rear view you disappear
When familiar turns foreign
You know the discord in the chorus
And usually I would've folded but

But not tonight
I ain't gonna be alone, I ain't gonna be alone
But not tonight
I ain't gonna be alone, I ain't gonna be alone, oh

I, I, I
I, I
Cause I owe you, you, you
Yeah, I owe you, you, you
I'm talking about you, you, you
I'm talking about you, you, you

Oh I want to hear your story
Whilst I work through your inventory
Your one-liners leave a shiner
You're not sober and I'm not either
Oh I wouldn't say I'm perfect
You can tell that from the surface
But i'd like to know your verdict, oh

Cause tonight
Yeah, I wanna take you home
Yeah, I wanna take you home
Cause tonight
Shouldn't have to be alone
Shouldn't have to be alone, oh

I, I, I
I, I
Cause I owe you, you, you
Yeah, I owe you, you, you
And I'm talking about you, you, you
I'm talking about you, you, you

Your decision for my admission
Was a plot twist, I must have missed it
I know we're a work in progress
I guess that I, should be honest
I don't know
Where will this go
But I owe you

Cause I owe you, you, you
Yeah, I owe you, you, you
And I'm talking about you, you, you
And I'm talking about you, you, you
