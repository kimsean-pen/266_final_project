Like a rat out of hell, I'm crawling
In search of a better space
I desire to get higher
But the world is a flustering place

Come down, you can't and you don't know why
You're scared, you choked me for real this time
My eyes roll back and I came with you
Our love was a trap and we both fell through

You and me
Backyard to backyard
Trampoline
To trampoline

Sometimes
When we're together
We're not together
And sometimes
I try to fake it
But you know me better

Come down I can't and I don't know why
I'm scared, you cracked me for real this time
'Til you said: It's fine, I'm fine, it's fine
It's fine, I'm fine, it's fine

You and me
Backyard to backyard
Trampoline
To trampoline

Sometimes
When we're together
We're not together
And sometimes
I try to fake it
But you know me better

You and me
Backyard to backyard
Trampoline
To trampoline

Sometimes
(Sometimes)
When we're together
We're not together
(We're not together)
And sometimes
(Sometimes)
I try to fake it
But you know me better

Sometimes
(Sometimes)
When we're together
We're not together
And sometimes
(Sometimes)
I try to fake it
But you know me better
