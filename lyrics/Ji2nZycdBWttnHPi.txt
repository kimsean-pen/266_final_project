You will want to know where I am now you know my dear
I was in the cherry tree when mother said to me
"You are only seventeen, you don't know what it means"
So I climbed down and picked the cherries that fell to the ground

I can't carry it alone
So I'll bury it like bones

You are only seventeen you don't know what to fear
All we know is what we have to hold and call my dear
I will want to know where you are if you're far or near
I don't know how loud I'll have to sing for you to hear

If I can't marry you I'll go
On my chariot of gold
There is only this I know
I will die before I'm old
