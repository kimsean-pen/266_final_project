in my night walk,
i see a world splashed of black white,
where all people live... without his rights,
in this doom I stand to this psycho fight,
with a constant questions... of "why?",
evening with... his fresh kiss,
freeze a dead society in a factice peace,
so, as a sad. chosen one,
I see all causes of this... psycho war,
such... a terrific storm,
in which all impur wind destruct this world,
where you feel you very alone,
where your mind is such gold yeah,
a mind explosion, thoughts expansion,
a psychic distortion, a human condition,
you'll never see... you'll never be... you'll ever
