Ask me to fetch your crown
Like the others would
Don't pretend we haven't seen your faded curtain
Hide behind your first impression
Leave this town for good

Ask me how and I wish I could stay for certain
All the time you passed them by
They turn their heads to look
Watch them while they get in line to be your servant
We can fake that native sound we make it by the book
Call me out on things you write that I inserted

Call me out to save your life as if to say I could
Don't pretend we haven't seen your faded servant
We can fake that native sound
And make it like they would
Call me out on things I write that you inverted
Hide behind your first impression

Leave this town for good
Ask me how and I wish I could say for certain
