Ain't nobody can love me like you do.
Ain't nobody can love me like you do.
Ain't nobody can love me like you do.
Ain't nobody can love me like you do.

Meet me in the red sky and dance with me,
let the valley change you and the night set you free.
This dusk in the desert,
it's heaven at the gate.
You are my desire,
You are my escape.

Ain't nobody can love me like you do.
Ain't nobody can love me like you do.
Ain't nobody can love me like you do.
Ain't nobody can love me like you do.

Open up this moment and bury me inside.
I can see us changing,
like a season over time.
It's sin underminds us,
seflections of your life.
Drown me in the silence,
it will never come undone.

Ain't nobody can love me like you do.
Ain't nobody can love me like you do.
Ain't nobody can love me like you do.
Ain't nobody can love me like you do.

woah oh x 3

Shadows are falling,
tomorrow is closing in.
Stay with me 'til morning,
open up your wings.
I can hear your whispers calling out my name,
will you promise me that you'll steal the night again?

Ain't nobody can love me like you do.
Ain't nobody can love me like you do.
Ain't nobody can love me like you do.
Ain't nobody can love me like you do.

woah oh x 3

Meet me in the red sky and dance with me,
let the valley change you and the night set you free.
This dusk in the desert,
it's heaven at the gate.
You are my desire,
You are my escape
