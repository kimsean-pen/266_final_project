Under the rising moon
Man's spirits rise
As they believe to soon reach
The pinnacle of ecstacy

Under the full moon one can hear
wolves screaming
In the dead of night
Commencing the gruesome war
Of the spirits
With man anaware of
The shattering of their dreams

Under the declinig moon
Wolves gather
To make a tribute
To the decay of man's spirits

Under the black moon
The wolves rejoice
As their victory is complete

In the Darkness
Ravens fly
