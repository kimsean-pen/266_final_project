I was blinded, You gave me eyes to see
I was going under, You reached out to me
No, there's nothing You won't do
To pick me up and pull me through
Every hour, eight days a week, yeah

Your love is like a fountain
It'll never run dry, it'll never run dry
Your love is moving mountains
Every day of my life, every day of my life
Can I get a witness?
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, Hallelujah
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, Hallelujah

We want glory, but can't measure up
We try money, but don't get enough
We fill our sky with fading lights
Try'n to guide us through the night
But You're the one thing, that'll carry us
Because...

Your love is like a fountain
It'll never run dry, it'll never run dry
Your love is moving mountains
Every day of my life, every day of my life
Can I get a witness?
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, Hallelujah
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, Hallelujah
Hallelujah

So much love, so much grace
C'mon now (can I get a witness?)
Somebody in this place
C'mon now (can I get a witness?)
So much love, so much grace
C'mon now (can I get a witness?)
Somebody in this place
C'mon now (can I get a witness?)
Oooooooh

Your love is like a fountain
It'll never run dry, it'll never run dry
Your love is moving mountains
Every day of my life, every day of my life
Can I get a witness?
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, Hallelujah
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, Hallelujah

Can I get a witness?
Ooh, can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Ooh, can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Oh-ooh, yeah, can I get a witness?
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, can I get a witness?
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, can I get a witness?
