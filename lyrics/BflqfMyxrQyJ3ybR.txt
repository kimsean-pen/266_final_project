You're laying here with a beds eye view of a body
That no longer belongs to you
You're scared that the past three haven't lived past their 60's
And if you break the trend
You'll just end up like the old folks at Roland
And thirty nine thirty nine
You're scared because you're an army brat of a man
Who died before his time

I miss those summers
That grill smell, home cooked meals
Take me back
Sleeping like a log, healing so fast
But losing you
I learned to lose my youth, lose my spirit
And now I can't hear it anymore, anymore

And I guess that's life
And I guess that's life
Back then our body parts stayed in place
And I guess that's life
And I guess that's life
We kept up with our own hearts
It was so easy to temper the sting
Just be fixed by a quick dip back in some
Old neighbor's swimming pool

Now I'm just worn out
And I'll ache like this forever I think
These shoddy drapes refuse to keep the cold out
And this damn body
Can't keep the warmth in
I'm watching my hairline recede
I'm drinking fatigue, I'm fighting heredity
I see less of who I love the most
Time's getting away and we're so slow
To say how fast it goes
And I'm just looking out, just looking for
What's coming
What's built in the blood
And I'm just looking out, just looking for
What's coming
What's built in the blood
And I'm just looking out, just looking for
What's coming
What's built in the blood

But I've never been
That sure of anything anyway
And I don't want to heal
And I'm just about the perfect amount to look how I feel
And I think about you laying there
Waiting for her to get back
And I think about your last three breaths
And I wonder if you knew
I wonder if you knew
And I think about letting you go
I think about letting go
And I guess that's life
