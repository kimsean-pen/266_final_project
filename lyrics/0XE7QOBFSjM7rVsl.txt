Light your cigarette and tell me
How I make the world okay
Then let's overdose on whiskey
And just fuck the pain away
For a moment lying next to you
Passed out in that hotel
I thought I could fix your broken pieces

But I'm in love with someone else
I'm in love with someone else
But I don't know, no I don't know who the hell

I would say your name
But I must have forgot it
Be with you everyday
If I didn't have to be honest
But let's be honest
I'm honestly not gonna be honest
I know you've got comprehension
But my life is beyond it
Just 'cause I kissed you once
That doesn't mean I love you
But it also doesn't mean
That I'm gonna forget about you
But let's forget it, I get it, you regret it
I wish you
Could understand for a minute
I know we've both got issues

I liked you better with the lights off
Because I couldn't see the end

So light your cigarette and tell me
How I make the world okay
Then let's overdose on whiskey
And just fuck the pain away
For a moment lying next to you
Passed out in that hotel
I thought I could fix your broken pieces

But I'm in love with someone else, oh yeah
But I don't know, no I don't know who the hell

You've got a piece of me
You can keep it forever
Can't give you everything
'Cause I barely hold it together
I barely, I barely hold it together
So either take what I give
Or give yourself to someone better, yeah
Just 'cause I kiss you once
That doesn't mean I hate you
But it also doesn't mean
That I'm obligated to make you
Feel validated
I'm waiting for you to change my nature
Until you do, I'm not giving up anymore of my paper

I liked you better with the lights off
Because I couldn't see the end

So light your cigarette and tell me
How I make the world okay
Then let's overdose on whiskey
And just fuck the pain away
For a moment lying next to you
Passed out in that hotel
I thought I could fix your broken pieces...

Light your cigarette and tell me
How I make the world okay
Then let's overdose...

So light your cigarette and tell me
How I make the world okay
Then let's overdose on whiskey
And just fuck the pain away
For a moment lying next to you
Passed out in that hotel
I thought I could fix your broken pieces

But I'm in love with someone else
But I'm in love with someone else
I'm in love with someone else
I'm in love with someone else
But I'm in love with someone else

But I don't know...
