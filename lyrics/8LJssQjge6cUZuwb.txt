And it started to rain, but I kept my cool
I feel a fool
She's just hurt and in vain
She's between the two

I put a good fight, it's a light hit
I turned my good side in

As she started to change, I remained the same
I played the game
Not too much, just a stain
I don't mind the wait

I put a good fight, it's a light hit
I turned my good side in
And as we stayed up, I could feel it
Through, in the road, as the race begins

I put a good fight, it's a light hit
I turned my good side in
And as we stayed up, I could feel it
Through, in the road, as the race begins
