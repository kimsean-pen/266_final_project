I'm getting tired of you pushing me 'round
Dragging me down, making a sound because you wanna
I guess that's why I like messing with you
Putting you through lesson or two, because I'm gonna
Before I go my own way, I just gotta say

Leave me alone, get out of my face
I'm tired and low, feeling so misplaced
Time for you to go,
you still know

I'm better off on my own
Leave me alone, this isn't gonna work
Don't call me on the phone, 'cause I'm all out of words
I'll face the unknown, thinking about
All the ways that I've grown

Oh, leave me alone (repeatedly)
There was the time I thought you were the one
Having some fun, getting it done, what an illusion
'Cause you were trying to take control of me
That couldn't be, I need to be free of this confusion

Don't give me a guilt trip, because I'm so over it
Leave me alone, get out of my face
I'm tired and low, feeling so misplaced
Time for you to go, you still know

I'm better off on my own
Leave me alone, this isn't gonna work
Don't call me on the phone, 'cause I'm all out of words
I'll face the unknown, thinking about
All the ways that I've grown

Oh, leave me alone (repeatedly)
Don't turn around and don't look back

I see right through all your selfless acts
Leave me alone, get out of my face
I'm tired and low, feeling so misplaced
Time for you to go, you still know

I'm better off on my own
Leave me alone, this isn't gonna work
Don't call me on the phone, 'cause I'm all out of words
I'll face the unknown, thinking about
All the ways that I've grown
Oh, leave me alone (repeatedly)
If you win your love
I'll feel better on my own
Leave me alone
