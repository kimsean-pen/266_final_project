There's a boy I know
He's the one I dream of, ooh
Looks into my eyes
Takes me to the clouds above, mm

Oh, I lose control (Ooh)
Can't seem to get enough, ahh (Get enough, ahh)
When I wake from dreaming (Ooh)
Tell me is it really love, ahh

How will I know? (Ooh, don't trust your feelings)
How will I know? (Know)
How will I know? (Ooh, love can be deceiving)
How will I know? (Know)

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you, 'cause you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone but I'm too shy, can't speak
Falling in love is all bitter sweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?
Oh, wake me

I'm shaking (Ooh)
I wish I had you near me now, ahh

Said there's no

Mistaking (Ooh)
What I feel is really love, ahh
Ooh, tell me

If he loves me
If he loves me
If he loves me not (Ohh yeah)
If he loves me
If he loves me
If he loves me not

Ohh, how will I know?

How will I know if he's thinking of me?

I try to phone but I'm too shy, can't speak
Falling in love is all bitter sweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

(How will I know?) How will I know
If he really loves me (How will I know?)
I say a prayer (Hey, how will I know?)
With every heart beat, (How will I know?)
I fall in love (How will I know?)
Whenever we meet (How will I know?)
I'm asking you (How will I know?)
'Cause you know about these things
How will I know? (How will I know?)
