Take it outside or leave it in your mind
Sometimes you find feelings you can't hide
Save it for the city if it don't look pretty
Baby it's a pity, it's a waste of time, it's alright

Ooh, sometimes you waste your time
It's alright to look around, if you're gonna skip town
Keep your head down, get your feet off the ground

They say you're really something
Why don't you find something better to do
We all want it to mean more than nothing
But nothing appears to be true

I see a green lady waiting on a sun-tanned man
10 dollars talking, a hundred in your hand
Radio's playing music I can't stand
Blow out smoke, share the pic with your fam

Mama got rich, but your daddy's the star
Perusing the charts but doesn't know who you are
Waking up early, take your seat at the bar
Do the loose tooth boogie, lock your keys in the car

They say I'm feeling something
Can't you find something better to do
We all want it to mean more than nothing
But nothing appears to be true

Stay where you are
Fill your head up with stars
Keep it light, it might get dark
Keep it light, it might get dark

You kinda need more love, but you're stuck in the rough
Are you numb to the touch, are you collecting the stuff
You were a typhoon smash, with your bag full of cash
Sold a few hats after the big money bash
In a microwave sea on a cruise ship for three
Piling all of the cheese til' it's up to your knees
Don't know what to do, but we're looking at you
On the fours and the twos, rewriting icy blues

They say I'm feeling something
Can't you find something better to do
We all want it to mean more than nothing
But nothing appears to be true
They say I'm feeling something
Can't you find something better to do
We all want it to mean more than nothing
But nothing appears to be true
