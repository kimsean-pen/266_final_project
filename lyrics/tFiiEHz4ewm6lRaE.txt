Don't worry about me
I'm gonna make it alright
Got my enemies cross haired
And in my sight
I take a bad situation
Gonna make it right
In the shadows of darkness
I stand in the light
Ya see it's our style
And I'll keep true
I had a bad year
But I got through
I've been knocked out
Beat down, black and blue
She's not the one
Coming back for you
She's not the one
Coming back for you

If I fall back down
You're gonna help
Me back up again
If I fall back down
You're gonna be my friend
If I fall back down
You're gonna help
Me back up again
If I fall back down

You're gonna be my friend

It takes disaster
To learn a lesson
We're gonna make it
Through the darkest night
Some people betray one
And cause treason

I wanna make
Everything alright

Well the worst of times
They don't faze me
Even if I look and
Act really crazy
On my way down
She betrayed me
Now my vision
Is no longer hazy
See I'm very lucky
To have my crew
They stood by me
When she flew
I've been knocked down
Beat down, black and blue
She's not the one

Coming back for you
She's not the one
Coming back for you

If I fall back down
You're gonna help
Me back up again
If I fall back down
You're gonna be my friend
If I fall back down

You're gonna help
Me back up again
If I fall back down
You're gonna be my friend

If I fall back down
You're gonna help
Me back up again
If I fall back down
You're gonna be my friend
If I fall back down
You're gonna help
Me back up again
If I fall back down
You're gonna be my friend
(If I fall back down)
If I fall back down
You're gonna help
Me back up again
(If I fall back down)
If I fall back down
You're gonna be my friend
(If I fall back down)
If I fall back down
You're gonna help
Me back up again
(If I fall back down)
If I fall back down
You're gonna be my friend
