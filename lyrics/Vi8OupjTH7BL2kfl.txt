All my life I've wanted to be somebody and here I am
I know what I've got and there ain't nobody
Gonna take it away from me
So let me tell ya what I am

I'm a red hot fox, I can take the knocks
I'm a hammer from hell, honey, can't you tell?
I'm the wild one, yes, I'm the wild one

I'm a touched up freak on a winning streak
I'm gonna own this town, you can't hold me down
I'm the wild one, yes, I'm the wild one

Well, it ain't no use, turn me loose
More, more, I can't keep score

I've got my head screwed on and the days are gone
When you kept me down and you pushed me 'round
I'm the wild one, yes, I'm the wild one

I'm a blue eyed bitch and I wanna get rich
Get out of my way 'cause I'm here to stay
I'm the wild one, yes, I'm the wild one

Well, it ain't no use, turn me loose
More, more, I can't keep score, yeah
Well, it ain't no use, turn me loose
More, more, I can't keep score

I'm a red hot fox, I can take the knocks
I'm a hammer from hell, honey, can't you tell?
I'm the wild one, yes, I'm the wild one

I'm a touched up freak on a winning streak
I'm gonna own this town, you can't hold me down
I'm the wild one, yes, I'm the wild one

I'm the wild one, yes, I'm the wild one
The wild one, yes, I'm the wild one
I'm the wild one, yes, I'm the wild one
I'm the wild one, yes, I'm the wild one
I'm the wild one
