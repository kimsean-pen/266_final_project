East coast hidin', hotel hoppin', there's no stoppin' us now
F train riding, perfect timing, I'm just closing my mouth
'Cause when I talk talk talk, I just fuck fuck fuck it up
Yeah, I overthink I'm so over slipping up

Envisioned you and I lighting up sometime
Pack a bowl for the soul on the greener side
By the grapevine, fucking with what ain't mine
But it's fun, but I'm having fun
If you want dramatics then I surely ain't the one, I ain't the one
Let us stay in BK where the waves are calm, that coney island charm

We're just sunset sitting while I'm painting you a vision
You ain't a homie if you fucking with the villian
I stay hush, let my tallys add up, and then I'm dipping
And then I'm dipping

'Cause when I talk talk talk, I just fuck fuck fuck it up
Yeah, I overthink I'm so over slipping up
Yeah, when I talk talk talk, I just fuck fuck fuck it up (fuck)
Yeah, I overthink I'm so over slipping up

I'm over words overflowing like they restless
I bit my tongue all along but it's endless
Overthinking like I don't work in the morning
Reality so fun, dreaming kinda boring
I got a list of criticism I'm ignoring
Ain't too concerned with conforming
Fitting in is foreign, to a woman like me
Barely a woman, nineteen

Pretty lies, pretty lights, white picket fence, beauty nothing but disguise
Flowers in my hair but I rip 'em out at night
Oceanic wet dreams with the love we can't find
We confined to a good time, we confined to a one-night, to a fuck
But I won't wife, to a like but I won't try

Yeah, when I talk talk talk, I just fuck fuck fuck it up
Yeah, I overthink I'm so over slipping up
