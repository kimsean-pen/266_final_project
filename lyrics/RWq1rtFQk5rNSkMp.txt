I have stood on the shores of a strange land
With my back to the wind on the black sand
I can hear you breathe
Watch me mouthing the words
And I wonder
Where you are now
Yeah, take me down
Love's gone

Trees are ahead
One for you
One for me
The banks were asteep but the road was free
And you (?)
Over
