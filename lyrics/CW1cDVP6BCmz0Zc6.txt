At the age of ten
My father showed me
What men were truly made of
And that's what I'm afraid of
Now that I'm older I've been
Growing closer with him
You showed me redemption
It helped me forgive him for leaving
Now when I wake up
I've been staring out my window
Thinking about what I'm made of
And how I'm afraid of myself
I can't let all of my problems tie me down onto my bed
Got to get out of my head and find some happiness instead
I need my own redemption, but I'm at a loss
I really need redemption, so here's a window into my own thoughts
