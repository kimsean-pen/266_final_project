About this time a year ago
We were walking through the snow,
You were all I'd ever known,
Missing you since I've left home

Touched down from New York back to L.A.
Forgot to get you flowers on your birthday,
Told me not to bother, called you anyway,
Forgot I didn't have any words to say.

The snow, the snow, the snow is melting now.
Everyday I'm lost in a new town.
I know, I know, I know it's so unfair,
I'm never there but I still care.

I know you, I know you, better than that,
I know you, I know you, better than that.

Let it wash over you like a wave,
Dive deep, girl you're safe.
You know I gave you everything before I gave it,
We will never be the same, can you forgive again.

You were all I'd ever known,
Missing you since I've left home

The snow, the snow, the snow has melted now.
Everyday I'm lost in a new town.
I know, I know, I know its so unfair,
I'm never there but I still care.

I know you, I know you, better than that,
I know you, I know you, better than that.
I know you, I know you, better than that,
I know you, I know you, better than that.

You're just nostalgic and it wasn't even that good
We could make it work baby, if you were coming home for good.
I know these things are hard to do,
Can't help but think that I'm better off without you.

The snow, the snow, the snow has melted now.
Everyday I'm lost in a new town.
I know, I know, I know its so unfair,
I'm never there, but I still care.

I know you, I know you, were better than that,
I know you, I know you, are better than that.
I know you, I know you, were better than that,
I know you, I know you, are better than that.
I know you, I know you, were better than that,
I know you, I know you, are better than that.
I know you, I know you, were better than that,
I know you, I know you, are better than that.

The snow, the snow, the snow has melted now.
Everyday I'm lost in a new town.
I know, I know, I know its so unfair,
I'm never there, but I still care.
