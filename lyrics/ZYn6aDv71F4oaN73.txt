there are rainbows and earthworms
and microscopic hummingbirds

i don't want to live through winter
i can't stand to see everything ending

i'll just stand on the meadow
i'll be taken by sunbeams
so goodbye

i don't want to live through winter
i can't stand to see everything ending

i don't want to live through winter
i can't stand to see everything ending

i'll just stand on the meadow
i'll be taken by sunbeams
so goodbye
