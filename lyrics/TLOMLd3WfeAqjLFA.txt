What if I said I was an accident waiting to happen
Would I trip and fall, fall on my words?
And would you say, say that I was wrong
My words were out of place
Went where I didn't belong?

This to me is fact and fiction plays a role
Confusing situations that I can't control
Heart of the matter, it beats with pride
Sometimes, I wear it on my sleeve
Sometimes, I keep it inside

And no one said it was gonna be easy
And I'm not afraid to try
And with the odds stacked up against me
I will have to fight
One life, one chance, gotta do it right

And I can't let fate dictate what's best for me
Gotta take control of my own destiny
You can't relate, you think there's no escape
But I got everything at stake here
Just to prove you wrong

And no one said it was gonna be easy
And I'm not afraid to try
And with the odds stacked up against me
I will have to fight
One life, one chance, gotta do it right

One life, one chance, gotta do it right
One life, one chance, gotta do it right
One life, one chance, gotta do it right
Gotta do it right
