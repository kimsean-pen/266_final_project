Spent my life searching for an answer
That never came
These subtle differences consuming my mind again

Something deep within me is screaming
I'm not alright
Can't let anyone see this breathe out and back in line

Take out my eyes, I follow the blind lead the blind
Out of fight, this feeling goes on as these

Towering walls crumble down I'm thinking
Why am I here, is this life worth living
Lost to betrayal of the mind

Whispering voices plant the poison
There's no way back
Beauty unfolds as the sun rises all I see is black

No more disease suffocating, I'll find my peace
This dead weight cut loose you're all better off without me
Take out my eyes, I follow the blind lead the blind
Out of fight, this feeling goes on as these

Towering walls crumble down I'm thinking
Why am I here, is this life worth living
Lost to betrayal of the mind

He beckons me, I'm drawn towards the peace
A resting place, these demons don't exist
There is no light only a great abyss
I've not the strength to stand and fight

He beckons me, I'm drawn towards the peace
A resting place, these demons don't exist
There is no light only a great abyss
I've not the strength to stand and fight

As these towering walls crumble down I'm thinking
Why am I here, is this life worth living
Lost to betrayal

As these towering walls crumble down I'm thinking
Why am I here, is this life worth living
Only to tell, if I'm destined to fail
Have I lost to betrayal of the mind
