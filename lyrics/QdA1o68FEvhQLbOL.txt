prove yourself
for another reason
shared your sins
you couldn't wait no longer
have you seen
my many reasons
a couple of times today
i can't stay
and wait no longer
for sharing lines
i can hardly dare to lose it

we have a lot of time but spend and lose it
i have time but i'm wasted again (2X)

have you seen
my many reasons,
shared your sins
you couldn't wait no longer
the dope is gone and now it's just us

found some time
can anyone try so hard
can you tell me a story
about a time with no lies (2X)

i have made
many decisions
I will change my life today
i can't stay
i won't be no longer
sharing lines
i can hardly dare to do it

i have time and i will wake up and prove it
i have time and i can handle it ok (2X)

found some time
can anyone try so hard
can you tell me a story
about a time with no lies

you couldn't wait no longer
have you seen
my many reasons.
