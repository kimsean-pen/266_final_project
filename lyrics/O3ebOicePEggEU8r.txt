I was sitting on a rock
just waiting for a key
to sleep inside the house
of old serenity

So I climbed onto your altar
begged, please don't let me falter
we'll put our oaths at stake
in a heaven that all icicles make.

All my devotion
compelled by an ocean
of all the years to come
of all the years to come

So we'll work until the night is quite
what once all our dreams were like
doing all the housework
returning all the schoolbooks

for good
Let's go on pretending that the light
is neverending -
we still have the summers
to be good to one another, yay hey
