I woke up this morning you were the first thing on my mind
I don't know were it came from all I know is I need you in my life, yeah
You make me feel like I can be a better woman
If you just say you wanna take this friendship to another place

Can I walk with you through your life
Can I lay with you as your wife
Can I be your friend 'till the end
Can I walk with you through your life

You've got me wondering if you know that I am wondering about you.
This feeling is so strong that I can't imagine you're not feeling it too.
You've known me long enough to trust that I want what's best for you.
If you want to be happy then I am the one that you should give your heart to.

Can I walk with you through your life
Can I lay with you as your wife
Can I be your friend 'till the end
Can I walk with you through your life

Now everyday ain't gonna be like the summers day.
Being in love it really ain't like the movies screen.
But I can tell you all the drama aside you
And I can find what the worlds been looking for forever.
Friendship and love together.

Can I walk with you through your life
Can I lay with you as your wife
Can I be your friend 'till the end
Can I walk with you through your life

Can I walk with you in your life?
Till the day that the world stops spinning.
Can I walk with you in your life?
Till the day that my heart stops beating.
Can I walk with you in your life?
Can I walk with you
Till the day that the birds no longer take flight
Till the moon is underwater
Can I walk with you
Can I walk with you

This is the moment I've been waiting for
Can I walk with you
Can I walk with you
Can I walk with you

You are everything I've been looking for
Can I walk with you
Creative intellectual
Can I walk with you
Can I walk with you as your wife
