We are echoes way out here
The silent scene is worth the climb though
The deserts feel, the deserts feel
You're kept in Cairo
Before I leave the blinding peace
I wonder why though
All your dreams are left to me

You
The light was upon us
Covering parts of
You
The call wasn't far
You reached it before our time
We reached it before our time

Under skies of what we leave
Horizons bleed as red as I've known
Stain and seethe, the white in me
Away from the shallows
I want to feel the higher needs
I want the wild
I want the wild

You
The light was upon us
Covering parts of
You
The call wasn't far
You reached it before our time

Come on
Leave your fallen years with mine
Come on
We reached it before our time

Fall in
It's all breaking at the cusp of us
Fall in
We were born from different parts of love
Fall in
To the neon and the lioness
Calling
To the darkness of the islands
Fall in
It's all breaking at the cusp of us
Fall in
We were born from different parts of love
Fall in
To the neon and the lioness
Calling
To the darkness of the islands

You
The light was upon us
Covering parts of
You
The call wasn't far
You reached it before our time

Come on
Leave your fallen years with mine
Come on
Feel the hollow easing out
Out
Apart we're reaching out
Out
We reached it before our time
