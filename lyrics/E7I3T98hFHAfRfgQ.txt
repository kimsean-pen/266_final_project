Sorry I didn't call.
I glued my phone to the table in the other room so
I would never be able to fuck with your head again,

but I still miss your bed.
I know I said I'd never let my peace of mind out of my head,
but it snuck out like we used to on Friday nights.
I know it's hard to understand what I've been going through.
I don't expect you to.

But I've been making progress in moving passed this.
Trying not to think about the things that we did,
and the way your eyes looked at night before we went to bed.

Now you've got 3 missed calls.
There's so much I could say.
We both roam different paths with 3 state lines in the way.
When you walk to class,
does the wind burn your face?
Does it mess up your hair?
15 hours on a train,
and you were home a couple days.
Now you wait for a call to ignore.
But I hope you know I avoid the streets
that used to lead my feet to your front door.

I hope you're making progress in moving passed this.
Try not to forget all the things that we did.
But we both know
