What lying shit will be said
Children guaranteed glory in death
Sweet and fitting in their tombs they rest
Squandered youth for the old terror

Blood-shod, all blind

In all my dreams
(They were fucking children)
Before my helpless sight
He plunges at me
Guttering, choking, drowning

How familiar [?] blood
The converted terror moves closer to carnage
Secret nobility and gilded deceit
The poison bringing composure at last

His hanging face
Like a devil's sick of sin

In all my dreams
(They were fucking children)
Before my helpless sight
He plunges at me
Guttering, choking, drowning

In all my dreams
Before my helpless sight
He plunges at me
In all my dreams
(They were fucking children)
Before my helpless sight
He plunges at me
Guttering, choking, drowning
