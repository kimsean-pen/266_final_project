I just wanna learn
You're my head
I just wanna live
You're my best

I can make it right
You're my guide
I just wanna fight
You're by my side

I just wanna taste
You're my skin
And i just wanna breathe
You're my air

And now it would be better
To stop and count
Looking into your eyes
And going through the clouds

Could start from here
I want to believer that you're real
I missed you so bad
Yeah, you seem so scared

Some rules will never be real
You can draw many fears
Can you live alone?
With your love up close to god
