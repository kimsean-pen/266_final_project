People say that I'm a narcissist
Cause I'm awake at this
Just think about myself
It doesn't mean that I'm a narcissist
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And you think that you had left my mind
Because I take my time
Just working on myself
It doesn't mean that you have left my mind
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Seems like the worst is over
Weight off my shoulders
And now my heart is sober from you
No, we don't have to end it
But I've been co-dependent
I used to break and bend till now
I don't need to think twice
I don't need to play nice
Feels like it's about time
Play by heart and not mind
And get a little selfish
I don't mean to act tough
I just pick myself up
Feels like it's about time
Play my heart and not mind
And get a little selfish
