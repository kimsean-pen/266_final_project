She a loyal bitch
You gotta pay for those
She a spoiled lil bitch
I bought her all her clothes
You know I treat you good
I don't wanna meet your hoes
I took you out the hood
I took you to my shows
We took a lot of pics
And now we look like goals,
We tried some new things
We fucked a couple hoes,
You changin' mood swings
You got me on those, we gettin' back in
Walked through the back door,
You had some surgeries
But it's a fact though,
You like the cash girl
You helped the cash grow
You drivin' lambos, with some leg room
Girl I'm waiting on you
Bring that bag home (ooh)

Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home

She don't play with bitches,
she don't play with hoes
Yeah she wit the shit
She might kill a hoe (Again)
If it's about young Carti,
Yeah my bitch on go
When she on that Molly
Anything goes
She was in Miami,
On a fuckin' boat
With some ball players
She left them niggas broke
She said "text my phone"
Tell me I'm alone
I respond back
When you coming home?
She respond back
I was in my zone
The money kind of on,
The money kind of on
Hold up, what you talkin' bout, come here
Girl I'm waitin' on you
Bring that bag home

Yeah
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
