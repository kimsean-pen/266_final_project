When the needle hits wax... it won't be long
You got your radio tuned.but it ain't gonna play this song
It's the sweetest sound you ever heard, and the metal flaked cherries always pass the word
Rub your genie down and get the news, it's time to ride with the strange dudes
Suns up, and we like it hot, and we always take our time... cuz it's what we got
The man shakes me down and that's why I'm broke, the rich man got all the green... but it ain't the kind we smoke
So we turn up our rock and we roll it slow, and we're always flying high... and the ride is always low
