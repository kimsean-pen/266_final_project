I saw the world through the stars
That crashed down to guide me to you
You smoked out your brain through a jar
Your blood lust told you what to do

I'm here to kill you and to take you away,
oh

I saw your future in time
And all of the evil you do
The mist in the sky was a sign
There'll be no tomorrow for you

I'm here to kill you and to take you away,
oh

And I work all alone
I don't need anyone
Find the seeds that you've sewn
And I'll be there
