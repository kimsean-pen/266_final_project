Help me out I need it
I don't feel like lovin' you no more
I don't feel like lovin' you no more

Help me out I need it
I don't feel like touchin' her no more
Help me out I need it
I don't feel like touchin' her no more

Well how did it happen?
I spent two long years in a strange, strange land
Well how did it happen?
I'd do anything just to be your man

And you're not going anywhere without me
These trials don't prepare the error, no
You're not telling anyone about me
And you shake and you plead while I sing my song

I don't feel like, I don't feel like
I don't feel like lovin' you
I don't feel like, I don't feel like
I don't feel like lovin' you

All the different places
Ringin' out like a shotgun in my head
All the pretty faces
Ringin' out and I just can't go to bed

Well how did it happen?
I spent two long years in a strange, strange land
Well how did it happen?
I'd do anything just to be your man
I'd do anything just to be your man

You're not going anywhere without me
These trials don't prepare the error, no
You're not telling anyone about me
And you shake and you plead while I sing my song

I don't feel like touchin' you
I don't feel like touchin' you
I don't feel like touchin' you
I don't feel like touchin' you, you can't tell anyone about me

But you're not going anywhere without me
Help me out I need it (help me out I need it)
You can't tell anyone about me (help me out I need it)
Help me out I need it

I don't feel like, I don't feel like
I don't feel like lovin' you
I don't feel like, I don't feel like
I don't feel like lovin' you
