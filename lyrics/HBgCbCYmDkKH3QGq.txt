Turn on that radio
As loud as it can go
Wanna dance until my feet can't feel the ground (feel the ground)
Say goodbye to all my fears
One good song, they disappear
And nothing in the world can bring me down (bring me down)

Hand clapping, hip shaking
Heart breaking, there's no faking
What you feel, when you're right at home, yeah (yeah)

Music's in my soul
I can hear it every day and every night
It's the one thing on my mind
Music's got control
And I'm never letting go, no, no
I just want to play my music (woo, music)

Got my six string on my back
Don't need anything but that
Everything I want is here with me (here with me)
So forget that fancy car
I don't need to go that far
What's driving me is following my dreams, yeah (yeah)

Hand clapping. earth shaking
Heart breaking, there's no faking
What you feel, when you're on a roll, yeah (yeah)

Music's in my soul
I can hear it every day and every night
It's the one thing on my mind
Music's got control
And I'm never letting go, no, no
I just want to play my music
I just want to play my music

Can't imagine what it'd be like (what it'd be like)
Without the sounds of all my heroes
Singing all my favorite songs
So I can sing along

Music's in my soul
I can hear it every day and every night
It's the one thing on my mind
Music's got control
And I'm never letting go, no, no
I just want to play my music

Music's in my soul
I can hear it every day and every night
It's the one thing on my mind
Music's got control
And I'm never letting go, no, no
I just want to play my music all night long (yeah)
