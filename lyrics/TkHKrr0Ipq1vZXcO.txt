(I will not give up on you)

Cute red hood come walk with me
Leave your room mate friend
Come up to this apartment with me
Your soft feet will melt
They walked so far, jumped workin' streets
They need to feel some furs
Come up to my den with me

(Wait, shoot straight)
Oh, I'm fevering
Oh, you make me want to...
Now I'm gonna gonna chase you

Ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

Cure that bug
Go walk with me
Leave your wounding girl
Come undo the love with me
You're some feet above her

There walks some far-fetched work in the street
They need to feel so firm
Come undo my death with me
We all feel lonely

Ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

Cure that bug
Go walk with me
Leave your wounding girl
Come undo the love with me
She said, We'll all feel. All together.
All feel. All together.
All feel. All together.
