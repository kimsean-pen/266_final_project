Winter Calls when I'm alone and at the end of the day
Like any fool who'd been the owner to a pretty face
Now time it separates us to a different place
I'd be alright if I could only stop thinking

And if I'm happy cause you say you are I'd be lying
And if I said I was a man that don't need anyone at all

Then I know I was wrong

But don't leave me out in the cold
Foolishly shaking my bones
If you don't want my heart let me know
I get lonely when winter calls

Winter calls the start of june until the end of May
Cause any rule I've ever had I've always had to break
I find I sit around trying to compensate
I feel alright at times but only when I'm drinking

And yes it hurts to know that I am not your obligation
But I don't want to spend a lifetime waiting...

And if I'm happy cause you say you are I'd be lying
And every time I close my eyes I'm hearing warning sirenes
The thought of you in someone else's arms and I feel violent
And if I said I was a man then maybe I was fool...
