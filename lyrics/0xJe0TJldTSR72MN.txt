I went as far as losing sleep
I went as far as messing up my life
Unloving still strike me difference
A million miles away from home
And fifteen from a pay phone

We reach out lonely on the sand
We reach out lonely on the sand
We reach out lonely on the sand
We reach out lonely on the sand

You're ten years older
And translate Japanese to English
And English to Japanese

It's not that simple
This dictionary
Never has a word
For the way I'm feeling

And it's nothing blame for me
Of a different dial and moral
What if I laid my head down on your stomach
And put my mouth to your hand

I cannot translate Japanese to English
Or English to Japanese

What I had to say is unsaid
What I had to do is undone
And if it was to hurt us
I'm sure it would not kill our hour

We reach out lonely on the sand
We reach out lonely on the sand
We reach out lonely on the sand
We reach out lonely on the sand

Above the water the awful gray
Our current from Japan
Didn't sweep away
