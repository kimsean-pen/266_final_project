Lucifer,
Venus at the break of dawn
I'm terrible with names but I love this one
Lucifer,
I indulge the dusk at times
There is no finer sight than that of you tonight

Everybody puts a prize on you,
of course they do
All I wanna do is strike a match,
set fire to you

I don't mind it if we cannot speak
I don't care much if we can
When you're with me I don't understand
Why on earth we would ever speak again

Lucifer,
I prefer the simple life
Although we'll never be quite of this earth
Lucifer,
I tried so hard to capture you
I made a song and dance of the most natural advance

Everybody looks you up and down,
with sordid plans
All I wanna do is strike a match,
and shake the ground

I don't mind it if we cannot speak
I don't care much if we can
When you're with me I don't understand
Why on earth we would ever speak again

I don't mind it if we cannot speak
I don't care much if we can
When you're with me I don't understand
Why on earth we would ever speak again
Why on earth we would ever speak again
