All those years
One day changes everything, and
Caught in your life and the passion fades away
Saving for something
That you'll never see in your days
Shutting out everything that you need

(Looking through distorted eyes)
Beautiful disaster
(Adding up a million lies)
So much for "ever after"

Building up your wall
Everything you wanted
Fit the pieces into holes we use to crawl away
Giving in or leave it to slide
Now we are what we have become

All the tears
You never thought you'd see the day when
The trappings of your life
Just seem to disappear
Goin' through the vacancy that you leave behind
Not what you were promised
Not what you believed

(Looking through distorted eyes)
Beautiful disaster
(Adding up a million lies)
So much for "ever after"

Building up your wall
Everything you wanted
Fit the pieces into holes we
use to crawl away
Finding out the truth, when
nothing really matters
Chase the light that's
blinding even as you crawl away
Giving in or leave it to slide
Now we are what we have become

Another vice to ease your pain
Now you know it's not the way out
Now you know it's not the way out
Not the way out

Building up your wall
Everything you wanted
Fit the pieces into holes we
use to crawl away
Finding out the truth, when
nothing really matters
Chase the light that's
blinding even as you crawl away
Giving in or leave it to slide
Now we are what we have become
Giving in or leave it 'til now
Now we are what we have become
