Whispers of the void
Guide us into the painted grey
We're tortured by solitude
Oblation to the shrine

Darkness flows through the rivers
And my lungs are filled with water
The abstract beauty of a moment
Became my emperor of decay

As the stars shine through the night
Each breath reflects in the stream
Pale blue moon, shimmering lights
Cold and desolate, choking life
