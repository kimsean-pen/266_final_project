human parasite
burn in the body bags
stuff the sacs with disease and filth
homicide to purify
a world of wither and wilt

we are the human parasite
slaves with no masters
human parasite
global infliction
global disaster

the ravens turn their eyes from the land
and take flight towards the sea
where they finally collapse in exhaustion
and sink to the abyss and algae

and the slugs burrow into soil
channeling through timber and vine
where they finally wain and wither
beneath weeping pines

and the wolves lead the flocks
to the hilltops
where they hurl unto plains below
twisted and broken by rock
they sink to the catacombs

oh
wrath of man
fur and claw
now flee the land

blind
to the failures of the flesh
nothing to return
nothing is left

human parasite
human parasite

conscience settles into comfort
still bound by tragedy
to an earth that heaves with ruin
contempt in suffering

look now upon your brother
the vessel of foul will
you will see the face of another
complacent with the blood that spills

servants with no masters
masters with no soul
man is a plague
swallowing all he beholds

oh
wrath of man
fur and claw
now flee the land

burn in the body bag
human parasite
burn in the body bag
human parasite
