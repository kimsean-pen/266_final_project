I can't help it, I can't win
I don't wanna let you in
And then you do it again

Take it off but take it slow
I don't wanna let you know
And then you do it again

I'm not talking to you anymore
Making my bed so I can lie there forever
I don't know what I'm doing this for
All I know is that I'm tired of being clever
Everybody's is clever these days

Take a win, take a fall
I never wanted your love but I needed it all
I never wanted your love but I needed it all
I never wanted your love but I needed it all

You're so close that I can't see
You keep trying to bother me
And then you do it again

Say you're right and I'll agree
I don't wanna set you free
And then you do it again

I'm not talking to you anymore
I'm making my bed so I can lie there forever
I don't know what I'm doing this for
All I know is that I'm tired of being clever
Everybody's is clever these days

Take a win, take a fall
I never wanted your love but I needed it all
I never wanted your love but I needed it all
I never wanted your love but I needed it all

I'm not talking to you anymore
I'm making my bed so I can lie there forever
I don't know what I'm doing this for
All I know is that I'm tired of being clever

Take a win, take a fall
I never wanted your love but I needed it all
I never wanted your love but I needed it all
I never wanted your love but I needed it all

Take a win, take a fall
I never wanted your love but I needed it all
I never wanted your love but I needed it all
I never wanted your love but I needed it all
I never wanted your love but I needed it all
I never wanted your love but I needed it all
