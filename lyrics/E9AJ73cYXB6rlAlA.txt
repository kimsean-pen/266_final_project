How much you going for a P?
I wanna fly for the next week
Now she on her knees
'Cause I let her fly for the free

Don't nobody love me
Don't nobody care where I spend my days
What you mean that you won't let me?
I thought you knew that I was this way

How much you going for a P?
I wanna fly for the next week
Now she on her knees
'Cause I let her fly for the free

Pick it up and break it down
Roll it up and pass it 'round
Louder than a fuckin' sound
Gotta grab it by the pound

Sometimes I feel it in my sleep
These demons, these demons
They drag me deep
So I gotta know...

How much you going for a P?
I wanna fly for the next week
Now she on her knees
'Cause I let her fly for the free

Why you acting like you got no options?
Everybody knows that you a star
Why you make it look like you so rotten?
Everyone is troubled in the dark
Everyone is troubled in the dark

How much you going for a P?
I wanna fly for the next week
Now she on her knees
'Cause I let her fly for the free

Babies dying, children crying
Twelve steady lying, tryna get us indicted
Maybe there's heaven for us
Always slighted, world wanna fight it
Always keep your peace on you
Maybe there's somewhere for us

Tell the youth 'The future's on your shoulders'
You can't lose your faith
You can be what you want when you get older
You can be what you want when you get older
