Hey, hey pretty baby
Baby, you sure is fine
Hey, hey pretty baby
Baby, you sure is fine
Every time I look at you
You drive me out of my mind

She got big blue eyes
Want her here by my side
She got big blues eyes
Want her here by my side
Hey, hey pretty baby
Let me be your little guide

She got ruby lips
Boy, she sure got pretty hips
She got ruby lips
Boy, she sure got pretty hips
And when she walks down the street
All the cats go flippity flip

She got big blue eyes
Want her here by my side
She got big blues eyes
Want her here by my side
Hey, hey pretty baby
Let me be your little guide

Hey, hey pretty baby
Baby, you sure is fine
Hey, hey pretty baby
Baby, you sure is fine
Every time I look at you
You drive me out of my mind

Hey, hey pretty baby
Baby, you sure is fine
Hey, hey pretty baby

You send me

(Sam Cooke)

Darling you, send me
I know you, you send me
Darling you, you send me
Honest you do, honest you do
Honest you do, honest you do

Darling you, you thrill me
I know you, you thrill me
I know you thrill me
Honest you do, honest you do
Honest you do

At first I thought it was infatuation
But ooh well it lasted
So very, so very, so very long
Now I find myself wanting you
And marry you and take you home

You, darling you send me
I know you, you send me
Darling you, honey, you send me
Honest you do, honest you do
My my

At first I thought it was infatuation
But ooh well it lasted
So very, so very, so very long
(but) Now I find myself wanting you
And marry you, and take you home

I know, I know, I know
You, you, you, you send me
And darling, darling you, you
Darling, you send me
I know you, you, you, you send me
Honest you do, honest you do
