Desiderata mi amor
Face like thunder
As you walk out the door
Write me off in a letter
Poison pen clues from a killer
Enough's enough

Murder my heart
Spit in my face
Shatter shatter
All you want is
Rid of me
A side effect
Of being sick of we
Murder my heart
Stabbed in the back
Liar liar
Fall to pieces
Watch me crack
Murder my heart
Murder
Murder
Murder my heart

Murder my heart
Murder my heart
Murder my heart
Murder my heart
Murder my heart

A violent open sore
Carved out hollow
A suicidal lost cause
Cry me
Cry me a river
The beat goes on and on
Where you slither
Done with love

Murder my heart
Spit in my face
Shatter shatter
All you want is
Rid of me
A side effect
Of being sick of we
Murder my heart
Stabbed in the back
Liar liar
Fall to pieces
Watch me crack
Murder my heart
Murder
Murder
Murder my heart

Murder my heart
Murder my heart
Murder my heart
Murder my heart
Murder my heart

I know it's not
Coming back to me
I know it's not
Coming back
I know it's not
Coming back to me
Oh oh oh
Not coming

Murder
Murder
Murder my heart

Murder my heart
Murder my heart
Murder my heart
Murder my heart
Murder my heart

I know it's not
Coming back to me
I know it's not
Coming back
I know it's not
Coming back to me
Oh oh oh
Not coming
