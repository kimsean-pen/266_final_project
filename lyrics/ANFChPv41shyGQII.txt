How do you do that with your eyes,
You know it gets me every time,
I swear I wish I could read your mind,
Cause I ask the same question every night

Pre-So just breath,
Breath in, breath deep, you know that's all you need,
I can't describe your eyes, but they're as blue as the sea
Your heart, it beats, in perfect time with me...

Baby you know that I won't mind,
If we get no rest, til' the sunrise.
Until you make me fall in love again, as light shows your face, I could never be the same
I plan to love you all my life,
Until you meet your chariot

What would I do without your eyes,
The way they look at me and mine,
& when your smile creates that dimple,
I tend to be used as your pillow,

Pre-So just breath,
Breath in, release you know that's all you need,
I can't describe your eyes, but when they're looking at me.
My heart, it beats & I can't seem to dream...

Baby you know that I won't mind,
If we get no rest, til' the sunrise.
Until you make me fall in love again, as light shows your face, I could never be the same
I plan to love you all my life,
Until you meet your chariot

Your fingers are mine,
As they intertwine,
You're telling me words unspoken...

Our fingers align,
As they intertwine,
You break my heart wide open...

Baby you know that I won't mind,
If we get no rest, til' the sunrise.
Until you make me fall in love again, as light shows your face, I could never be the same
I plan to love you all my life,
Until you meet your chariot

Until you meet your chariot... x3
