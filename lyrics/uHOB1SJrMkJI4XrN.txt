You got my eye and I'm tryin' to holla at ya
You're walking by and I trip my the furniture
I'm on my ride down won't stop movin'
And I don't know exactly what I'm doin'
I see you shake, shake and I'm spinnin'
It's like a one win race, Yeah, I'm winnin'
I'm all dizzy when you're here with me
So, let's bring the heat
Cause' there ain't nothin' to it
Just gotta do it
You've got to own it, own it
Welcome to the beat of your own drum
When it's hot like that (Burn it up like that)

Welcome to the beat of your own drum
If you got it like that (Yeah, it's hot like that)
Eh Eh
Gotta make it say Eh Ehhh
So bang A Drum
Bang A Drum
You got me floatin' ten feet off the ground
It's like whoa
I'm up and I can't come down
My heart's pumpin' and it's workin' overtime
I got the crazy butterflies
We're doin' it right when we work together
With you by my side, it don't get better
If you want my team, gotta figure it out

It's you and me, no doubt

Cause' there ain't nothin' to it
Just gotta do it
You've got to own it, own it
Welcome to the beat of your own drum
When it's hot like that (Burn it up like that)
Welcome to the beat of...
You gotta deep it down low,
When you got it like that (Yeah, it's hot like that)
Eh Eh
Gotta make it say Eh Ehhh
So bang A Drum
Bang A Drum
You're Bang A Drum
Turn it up

Bang A Drum, Yeah
You're Bang A Drum

Turn it up
