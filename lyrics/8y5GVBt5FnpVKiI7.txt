Sweet honey I can feel you in my veins
I don't wanna feel the pain you can take it all away
Pink flower I can feel you in my hair
When you hear the words I say
Could you make yourself aware
Your beautiful mind is far too pretty to understand mine
But why it feels so right
When those hazel eyes look straight into mine
Without you I don't know what I would cease to do
I don't know what I would do
Without you all I would ever see is the color blue
All I'd see is blue
Sweet lover when you kiss away my tears
I go up into cloud nine and forget all of my fears
I still feel the same as I did last December
Kissed your lips for the first time
A time without you I don't wanna remember, oh no
Your beautiful mind is far too pretty to understand mine
But why it feels so right
When those hazel eyes look straight into mine
Without you I don't know what I would cease to do
I don't know what I would do
Without you all I would ever see is the color blue
All I'd see is blue
Sweet universe you finally did it right
You brought up all of my hopes
And brought love into my life
Oh your beautiful mind is far too pretty to understand mine
But why it feel so right every time I look into your hazel eyes
