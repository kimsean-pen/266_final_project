Watch as the world turns around
While you blink your eyes
(Time to awaken)
Abandon trivial laws you abide
They hinder fulfillment and purpose of life

Crusading dreams
Fantasies
Reality

Dark clouds will overthrow
A silver line will show
Search for your destination
Judgment fly by
Decoded poetry lives in anthology
Reveals severed visions of agony secretly

Imagine the face of the Earth will lift up the veil
(No more pretending)
The only idols that fill you with hope
Should not be the ones that will vanish in smoke

Crusading dreams
Fantasies
You are the one behind the wheel

Dark clouds will overthrow
A silver line will show
Search for your destination
Judgment fly by
Decoded poetry lives in anthology
Reveals severed visions of agony secretly

An inner war that weighs you down
Take fate into your own hands
And face the fury burning within
This entity is your device
You have to pay for your sins
Summon your mind and you will prevail in the end

Tempus solum esrt quod nos possidemus
Ut ad praeteritum recedarmus non fieri potest
Diem carrere mandatum nostrum est

The present lives in you
Memories created
Venerate dedicate
The time to live life and realize

Extend your mind
Accept defiance
Ipse facis consilia
Chasing ideals bound to be ruined
Persequere imagines optimas

Dark clouds will overthrow
A silver line will show
Search for you destination
Judgment fly by
Decoded poetry lives in anthology
Reveals severed visions of agony secretly

We can be
We can see
Everyone will fight to find their way

I'm here to survive
I'm stronger now and will fight
(Never hide)

I'm drawn by the light
And will never run and hide

Do not believe in tainted trust
(You're blinded by the light)
The root of hate turns into dust

Animus a quopam iuvatus
Omnia effecit
