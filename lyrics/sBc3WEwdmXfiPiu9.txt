australian man
scandinavian tan
kicking stones round a square
he sat for a while and carved out a smile
as if someone would care

said i'm a long way from the gold coast
furthest i've ever known
oh and this just ain't my home
it was my wife's idea
but she's no longer here
she left me travelling alone

i've never heard silence
ring out like a bell
i've never heard silence
like last night in my expensive hotel
well i'm loving a shadow
and trying to catch the rain
but i never heard silence
til i heard it today

well she walked out of the hotel
i could still smell the smoke,
of a burning heart left inside
she said men are all arseholes
and life's a bad joke
she laughed and started to cry

see ten years with this man
and a lifetime of plans
oh and i loved him to his bones
but now i've lines on my skin
and he's traded me in
and left me travelling alone

well i never felt silence
hit me like a train
i never felt silence
like blood course through my veins
well i'm loving a shadow
and trying to catch the rain
i never heard silence
til i heard it today
i never felt silence
til i felt it today
