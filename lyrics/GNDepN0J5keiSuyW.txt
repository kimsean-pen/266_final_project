Your face's to young
To be taken serious
And the adults are armed
'Cause they planning his flag
Your face's to young
To be safe and indifferent
And all the adults are drunk
'Cause they can't stay in bed

Life's so much better, when tied to the ceiling
Life's so much better, when drowning in the sea

And all those different stories
That's if you bothered to listen
When everyone's deaf
And somehow, you will enjoy what you're seeing
Me on the ground, having no clue

Life's so much better, when tied to the ceiling
Life's so much better, when drowning in the sea

Close your eyes to exit
Close your eyes to exit
Close your eyes to exit, this time
