All I have right now is right here
And right now
All I have right now is right here

I want what I want, I always have
When no one cared about me, dreams were all I had
But nightmares grow when no one's listening
And idle thoughts will do their thing
I still feel so much pain here from the past

And it cuts like a knife
It feels like a fight to take back your life

Searching for the meaning, I'm living in these feelings
I'm ready for a reason to believe
Now I'm working on my insides 'cause outside there's no reasoning
With anyone's here, it's never what it seems

All I have right now is right here

I felt too bad about myself
I never thought I was good enough for anybody else
I couldn't look love in the eye, I was too broken to try
Life was a cold song that taught me not to cry

And it cuts like a knife
It feels like a fight to take back your life

Searching for the meaning, I'm living in these feelings
I'm ready for a reason to believe
Now I'm working on my insides 'cause outside there's no reasoning
With anyone's here it's never what it seems

How long I waited
Feeling lost, frustrated
Locked out and I'm on my own
Cornered and ain't got no place to go
How long should I stay here all alone?

Searching for the meaning, I'm living in these feelings
I'm ready for a reason to believe
Now I'm working on my insides 'cause outside there's no reasoning
With anyone's here it's never what it seems

All I have right now is right here
