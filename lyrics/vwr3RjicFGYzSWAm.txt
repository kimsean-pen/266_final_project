God only knows
This isn? t Heaven
The promises made
He never keeps them

We? re walking on air
We? re taking our time
But God only knows
This isn? t reason or rhyme

I? ve had this feeling
I don? t believe in
It? s happened before
I just reject it

We? re walking on air
We? re taking our time
But God only knows
This isn? t reason or rhyme

These are the feelings
I know their outcome
It? s useless pretending
I? d like to beat them

We? re walking on air
We? re taking our time
But God only knows
This isn? t reason or rhyme

We? re walking on air
We? re taking our time, this time
But God only knows
This isn? t reason or rhyme

We? re walking on air
