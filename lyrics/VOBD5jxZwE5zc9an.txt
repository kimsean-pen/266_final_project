Doctor
What is happening to me?
Palpitations
My mind's diseased
Even my vision is impaired
I'm losing my hair
Cos when I hold her in my arms
I feel like Fred Astaire

Lovesick
My temperature's high
Just met a girl
Who believes we can fly
I'm a bull not a bear
I'm a millionaire
And when I hold her in my arms
I feel like Fred Astaire

I believe in happiness
I believe in Love
I believe she fell to earth
From somewhere high above
I believe in Hollywood
Don't believe that Love must bring despair
Cos when I hold her in my arms
I'm just like Fred Astaire

He said love is just a disease
A plague for the na√Øve
These days no one believes
These days no one believes

Meteors may strike the earth
Nations live and die
I'm the boy who got the girl
Who showed me how to fly
We can cross the race divide
Bridge a gap that wasn't really there
When I hold her in my arms
I feel like Fred Astaire
I'm gonna hold her in my charm
Just like Fred Astaire
