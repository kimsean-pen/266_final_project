If I could keep it for myself
What did you say? I am confused
I don? t remember what did we do last week

Can you imagine in the dark?
Everything has been cynically shot, it? s gone
Are there no surprises anymore?

It was hot then it was cold
The view imagined in the dark
My heart sticking to my ribs
Your back? s clammy with the heat

If I could keep it for myself
If I could keep it for myself
(If I could keep it, if I could keep it)
(If I could keep it for myself, if I could keep it)

If I could keep it for myself
