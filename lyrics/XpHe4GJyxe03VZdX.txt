When your dead rope machine grows cold
I'll make you another one out of gold
Oh, and when we die - a beast like everyone
We'll find you and remind you
You shined once

C'est la vie, la vie
What may be has already been - it's all the same
And you dance your magic dance
And you try so hard you try
To retie all those bitter ends and push them back inside
Here's my halo...
I don't think I'll need that

There's a stranger at the door
He cuts with frayed incisions on the rope we hold
Oh and when we die - a beast in all of us
Will find you and remind you
You shined once

C'est la vie, la vie
What may be has already been - it's all the same
And you dance your frantic dance
And you try so hard you try
To retie all those wicked skins and push them back inside
Here's my halo
I don't think I'll need that

And I...
Wherever I will go
Wherever I go
I wear that coiled fear
And in a way the riddle ends
When we can but only, and always doubt
So let it all out, let it all out

You and I will cut our nooses loose
You and I will draw a course
If you and I can find a few more minutes
To find a way to find a road
You and I will never be alone
