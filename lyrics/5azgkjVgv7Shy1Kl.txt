In it right to the end
Close the show
Turn into sand in Kauai
Living, all it can give
Good to know
Out of the lens in my life

Being here
Means seeing clearly
Being here now
Means calming down
Sincerely

Going well as it can
Who's to know
Somebody else's problem
Living, onto the edge
Off the road
Out of the lens, at my life

Being here
Means seeing clearly
Being here now
Means calming down
Sincerely

Seeing the trees for the leaves
And all the grass for the weeds
Going to sleep for the dreams
The dreams

Being here
Means seeing clearly
Being here now
Means calming down
Sincerely
Being here now
Means calming down
Sincerely

Seeing the trees for the leaves
And all the grass for the weeds
Going to sleep for the dreams
The dreams
