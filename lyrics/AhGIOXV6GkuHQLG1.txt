Great defacer of the universe
Unholy human sacrifice
I spit redemption, denounce your existence
Through sacred terrified devotion

Impalement execution
Impalement execution

Contagious serpent, pest divine
I am what rots you from inside
Nefarious spirit iniquity arise
Never again - vengeance is mine

Impalement execution
Impalement execution

Storm, convulsions
Behold the rapture in the pain divine
Break the covenant, strike the punishment
Poison arrogance
Devour your tongue
Blinded eyes, tortured fucking life
Blessed are the dead, cursed are the living
I cut down the world

Life requires sacrifice
Requires purged minds
Eternal hate inside
Hang, drawn, quartered and plagued
Trial by fire and raped
Savage heaven dynasty

Shame will follow
Scorn will follow
Frost will follow

Vile throes
Ancient death
Infernal hollow

Abyss will follow
Hurt will follow
No tomorrow

Evil throes
Ancient rites
Impalement execution
