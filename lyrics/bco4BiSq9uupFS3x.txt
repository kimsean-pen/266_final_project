Wake in the morning, feeling low
I don't sleep at night
Oh you've broken my heart
Here in the dark moonlight

I see a rainbow, I don't know where it goes
Going to follow my dreams
Oh someday baby
There gonna shine for me

I'm leaving Lady Solitude behind me, you understand
Yes I'm leaving Lady Solitude behind me, you understand

I know the story, I know how it goes
You've broken into my soul
But you won't take it out
On me no more

I hear a whistle blowing, moaning low
Guess I'll ride that train
Well you never wrote a letter
And you hurt your man again

I'm leaving Lady Solitude behind me, you understand
Yes I'm leaving Lady Solitude behind me, you understand

I'm leaving Lady Solitude behind me, you understand

There's a river flowing, away from my door
Think I'll sail away
Oh and one day baby
I will feel no pain

Think it's raining, in my soul
Flowing from my eyes
Think this morning will see us
Say our last goodbye's

I'm leaving Lady Solitude behind me, you understand
Yes I'm leaving Lady Solitude behind me, you understand
Well I'm leaving Lady Solitude behind me, you understand
You understand...!
