Another day has come and gone
And I've been holding in.
Not holding on

Feeling out of place, I
I'm wanting to escape, I
I pack my bags with nothing left to say

It's when I think I've figured out
The figures simply turning
Inside out

Burn before it catches, I
I rummage through the ashes, I
I turn the page with nothing left to say.
