Oh, I for one may not shy,
Away from the fact that I'm sick,
And too tired to stand this,
It all seems contagious.
I know a few would back that up,
Can't say a few is not enough,
To skip a beat in this motion sickness.
I'd second that emotion.

Our state,
Our state,
Our state of grace is gone.
Our state,
Our state,
Our state of grace is gone.

Oh, I for one don't want to die,
Old and in the way from poison.
'Cause I hate the taste of medicine,
We all hate the taste of medicine.
I know a few would back that up,
Can't say a few is not enough,
To skip a beat in this motion sickness.
I'd second that emotion.

Our state,
Our state,
Our state of grace is gone.
Our state,
Our state,
Our state of grace is gone away.

Our state of grace is crumbling,
I fear we're good for nothing,
And simply disintegrating into the terra firma.

Our state,
Our state,
Our state of grace is gone.
Our state,
Our state,
Our state of grace is gone.
May we combine tradition,
Science and innovation.
To benefit what's ailing,
Our state of grace is gone.
