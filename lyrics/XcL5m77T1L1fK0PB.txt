Hey!
One man, one goal
Ha, one mission
One heart, one soul
Just one solution
One flash of light
Yeah, one God, one vision

One flesh, one bone
One true religion
One voice, one hope
One real decision
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Gimme one vision, hey!

No wrong, no right
I'm gonna tell you there's no black and no white
No blood, no stain
All we need is one world wide vision

One flesh, one bone
One true religion
One race, one hope
One real decision
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

I had a dream when I was young
A dream of sweet illusion
A glimpse of hope and unity
And visions of one sweet union

But a cold wind blows
And a dark rain falls
And in my heart it shows
Look what they've done to my dreams

One vision

So give me your hands
Give me your hearts
I'm ready
There's only one direction

One world, and one nation
Yeah, one vision
No hate, no fight
Just excitation
All through the night
It's a celebration
Woah, woah, woah, wo-ooah, wo-ooah, yeah, yeah

One flesh, one bone
One true religion
One voice, one hope
One real decision

Gimme one light
Yeah!
Gimme one hope
Hey!
Just gimme
One man, one man
One bar, one night
One day, hey, hey
Just gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme
