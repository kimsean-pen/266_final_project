Ain't a hope in Hell
Nothing's gonna bring us down
The way we fly
Five miles off the ground

Because
We shoot to kill
And you know we always will
It's a bomber, it's a bomber

Scream a thousand miles
Hear the black death rising moan
Firestorm coming closer
Napalm to the bone

Because
You know we do it right
A mission every night
It's a bomber, it's a bomber, it's a bomber

No night fighter
Gonna stop us getting through
The sirens make you shiver
You bet my aim is true

Because
You know we aim to please
Bring you to your knees
It's a bomber, it's a bomber, it's a bomber
