Seraph let me be immortal like you.
Immaculate rot, acurse in divinity, the somber begining of birth.

Seraph let me be immortal like you.
Immaculate rot, acurse in divinity, the somber begining of birth.
Is the eternal glory of demonic conception...

Plain of decay, sorrow and anguish, mortal's roam.
The cycle of agony is reborn.
Immortal cessation, denied assention...

Jesus... was... mortal...
