I took the last train home

I really need to be alone

Concrete gets so cold right before it breaks your bones

And I'm so claustrophobic

So don't hold me so close

You know I'd be so lost

if you ever let me go

I've got things I wanna do

And the moon is glowing in my bedroom

This is hoping/helping
We are: not broken
Stitches: open
Love: bleed out out...

Call: "shot gun!" in your car

Don't care where

Drive me far

Out of the city with the windows down

Somewhere where we can't be found

Spend this sun and months

Learning how to hunt

Out of the city with the windows down

Somewhere where we can't be found

Dips in my shoulder
shop in my tounge
Oh my mouth is gonna get it done

Dips in my shoulder
shop in my tounge

No never again I'm gonna be this young

How late do you stay up

Oh I'm not sleeping no not that much

I've got things I wanna do
And the moon is glowing in my bedroom

This is hoping
We are: not broken
Stitches: open
Love: bleeds out

It's you you you

I've got things I wanna do
And the moon is glowing in my bedroom

This is hoping
We are: not broken
Stiches

I've got things I wanna do
And the moon is glowing in my bedroom

This is hoping
We: are not broken
Stitches

Uhuuuuuhhuhuhuhuuhuuuu

Ohhhaaaaahhhaaa

This is Hoping
We are not broken
Stitches open
Love bleeds out
This is hoping
We are broken
Stitches out
Love bleeds out
