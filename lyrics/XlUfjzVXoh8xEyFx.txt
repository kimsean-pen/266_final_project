Take a page
Draw a happy face inside a heart
Picture you, picture me, picture everyone

Draw the lines
Of fireworks exploding in the sky
Red and blue, pink and green, cover all the white

Paper girl, standing in a row of paper doll chain
And look at him: hearts flying from his head around mine

Thought bubble
With shuttlecock and racket on my mind
Instead of hearts, 'stead of love
I have badminton

And all the other things
That make me turn away
From the side between us, from our paper chase

Paper girl, standing in a row of paper doll chain
And look at him: hearts flying from his head around mine
