The afterbirth has barely dried
When the king of ruling time
Comes with a sickle in his hand to devour

Devour
Descendant of chaos
Devour
Castrated the father
Devour
Fearing his overthrow
Devour
Swallowed children whole
Swallowed children whole

Take your teeth out of me
I have just begun to breathe on my own
I don't know what this is
These eyes can hardly see what is eating me

The prisoners rotting in their cells
Children of this godless hell
Digesting in acidic blood the devoured

Devour
Descendant of chaos
Devour
Castrated the father
Devour
Fearing his overthrow
Devour
Swallowed children whole
Swallowed children whole

Take your teeth out of me
I have just begun to breathe on my own
I don't know what this is
These eyes can hardly see what is eating me
Take your teeth out of me
I have just begun to breathe on my own
I don't know what this is
These eyes can hardly see what is eating me

He who spawned the furies
Severed the genitals of his father
Creating such beauty: the goddess of love
But the blood that fell to the ground made the erinyes

He who spawned the furies
He who spawned the furies

Wreathe with serpents
Eyes dripping blood
Winged tormentors of criminals
Criminals

Take your teeth out of me
I have just begun to breathe on my own
I don't know what this is
These eyes can hardly see what is eating me
Take your teeth out of me
I have just begun to breathe on my own
I don't know what this is
These eyes can hardly see what is eating me
