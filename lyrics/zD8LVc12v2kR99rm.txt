There's a flame that leads all souls astray
No one's safe from its tender touch of pain
Everyday it's looking for new slaves
To celebrate the beauty of the grave

We are like the living dead
sacrificing all we have
for a frozen heart and a soul on fire
we are like the living dead
craving for deliverance
with a frozen heart and a soul on fire

Again we're falling for disgrace
and hate will shelter us from the rain
we are enslaved by the sacred heart of shame
and gently raped by the light of day

We are like the living dead
sacrificing all we have
for a frozen heart and a soul on fire
we are like the living dead
craving for deliverance
with a frozen heart and a soul on fire

Addicted to our divine despair
the venom of the cross we bear
the guilt will follow us to death

We are like the living dead
sacrificing all we have
for a frozen heart and a soul on fire
we are like the living dead
craving for deliverance
with a frozen heart and a soul on fire
