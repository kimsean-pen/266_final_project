it's not without it's consequence
it's not without its joy

sell it to myself
sell it to myself
then sell it to the world

it's not without belligerence
it's not without a ploy

sell it to myself
sell it to myself
then sell it to the world

it thrives in one fraternity
and slowly will destroy

sell it to myself
sell it to myself
then sell it to the world
