You wanna know me?
What's to know?
To amuse you
When the night is slow
Do your eyelids ever close
Caught spirits in your waking woes?

I know where to find you
I know where you go
And I just want to let you know
You can have me
You can have me all

Am I twisted?
What can I say?
Your days are empty
And my tongue's decayed
And will you stay up just to tempt me
One more night of your company

I know where to find you
I know where you go
And I just want to let you know
You can have me
You can have me all
