I want to learn
Just how to love
I want to listen
I've had enough

I want to turn
I want to live
I want to vision
I need this
I need this

Remember when
We found our shade
We made it heaven
But how did we escape

I want to leave
Without a trace
But I keep failing
I need this
I

I get the feeling
Part that we never would have known
I get the feeling
Part that we never could have saved
I get the feeling
Part that we'd never go home again
I, I, I, I

I want to fly
An empty space
Where I can focus
Focus on the pain
I need this

I get the feeling
Part that we never would have known
I get the feeling
Part that we never could have saved
I get the feeling
The part that we'd never go home again
I, I, I, I, I, I, I

Welcome home
I've waited, a lifetime to say this
I looked out, at your gloves
The beauty, you painted
You chose love, you chose love
You threw down, your ball gown
You chose love, you chose love, you chose love, you chose blood

I get the feeling
The part that we'll never go home again
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
