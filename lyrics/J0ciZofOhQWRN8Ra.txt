Meditations on formless mists
Succumb to auras of nothingness
Interwoven miseries
The path to hell
Is becoming hell oneself
(Your spirit separates)

Morphed forms
Entangled by destroyed emanations
(Fading into shadows)

Ensnared with wrathful magick
Hanged inside by invisible nooses
Chained to the spirits of the depths
(Constricting souls pulse)

Nigredo secretion
Inverse pulsation
Eternal dissolve
Internal dissolve

Bottomless night
Poisonous chasm
A glow from beneath
Blood and flame transmute
To absolve
