You give me feelings that I can't describe
About to lose my mind
Got me waiting on the edge so high
I'm falling hard this time

And Oh Oh
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
Where this goes
But you got me

I'm kinda curious
You're so misterious
I can't stop thinking 'bout
Thinking about
You got me crazy
And I feel amazing
And I can't stop thinking 'bout
Thinking about you
Thinking about
Thinking about you

You can't deny that we got chemistry
So let's not hide and seek
No! Yeah we're vibing without gravity
And you're lifting up my feet

And Oh Oh
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
Where this goes
But you got me

I'm kinda curious
You're so misterious
I can't stop thinking 'bout
Thinking about
You got me crazy
And I feel amazing
And I can't stop thinking 'bout
Thinking about you
Thinking about
Thinking about you

Oh oh oh oh
We could run away
Oh oh oh oh
To another place
Oh oh oh oh
I'm feeling kinda crazy
Oh oh oh oh
Just say the words

I'm kinda curious
You're so misterious
I can't stop thinking 'bout
Thinking about
You got me crazy
And I feel amazing
And I can't stop thinking 'bout
Thinking about you
Thinking about
Thinking about you
