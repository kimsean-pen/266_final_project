It starts out like a season in reverse
A way to set your mind above and over words
Attached means identity
Erases things so how can we record?

Distress call code-word is I wanna live
He makes it up as it goes, it goes away
To places he can only hide in other peoples minds
Oh he makes it up as it goes
It goes away

Your rational mind's insane
Taste the sound you make
The light from the sun it's a story never gets sold
The light from the sun it is your mother
Attached means identity
Erases things so why should we?

Distress call code-word is I wanna live
He makes it up as it goes, it goes away
To places he can only hide in other peoples minds
Oh he makes it up as it goes

With an effortless smile you pervade to be
And in-between aisles, they would say you must stare to see

With an effortless smile you pervade to be
Always in-between aisles, an optimistic daring me

Would you trade your soul for gold?
Would you trade your soul?
Would you trade?
