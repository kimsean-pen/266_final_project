I'm so cold inside
My feelings can't survive
Your torturous screams
Mean nothing to me

This dying world gasps its last breath at me
Die by my hands
All hope is lost
There'll be no new dawn
And all of your dreams will die (die)

I need something to fix the pain
Baby, baby, please stick the needle in
Then I'll be dead and blue
Just like you

This dying world gasps its last breath at me
Die by my hands
All hope is lost
There'll be no new dawn
And all of your dreams will die (die)

They're still haunting me
I know I'll never be free
Lucifer, my only friend
I'll burn in hell to the end, yeah!

I'm so dead inside
Wishing I could die
Your torturous screams
Still haunt my dreams

This dying world gasps its last breath at me
Suffer by my hands
All hope is lost
There'll be no new dawn
And all of your dreams will die (die)

This world is crazy and makes me sick
Maybe I'll torture you just for kicks
But I lie here possessed by evil
Forever a servant of the devil
