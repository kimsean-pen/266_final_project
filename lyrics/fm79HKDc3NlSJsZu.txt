People want my power, and they want my station.
Storm my winter palace, but they couldn't take it.
All the way to Paris. Run my reputation.
Try to pull my status, but they couldn't fake it.
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)

Tryin' to pull a full-on, your guys won't go.
Running, checking out your ass, oh no!
Man, looking for your ticket, now let's all go.
Party's in a minute, but your guys won't go.

Man, you look, you look on your bracelet.
But I'm too gone, I took on that ass, oh no!
When you get on, you get on, you shake it.
Man, you took on, you took on too much, don't blow.

People want my power, and they want my station.
Storm my winter palace, but they couldn't take it.
All the way to Paris. Run my reputation.
Try to pull my status, but they couldn't fake it.
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)

Can I get a witness? A closer look?
Everybody itching for a throne to throw.
And you could be the widget to my turbo.
Better see your status when I go solo.
Do you forget, forget the basics?
On a go long, a go long, you must go search
and it's too far, it's too far; the bases
but you're slipping, you're sliding to make it go.

People want my power, and they want my station.
Storm my winter palace, but they couldn't take it.
All the way to Paris. Run my reputation.
Try to pull my status, but they couldn't fake it.

How hard we found
another instrument to crash you!
Crash you!
Crash you!
I need a. . . another instrument to crash you!
Crash you!
Crash you, honey!
Ha! Ha! Crash!
Ha! Ha! Crash!
Ha! Ha! Crash!
Ha! Ha! Crash!
Ha! Ha! Crash!
Crash!

People want my power, and they want my station.
Storm my winter palace, but they couldn't take it.
All the way to Paris. Run my reputation.
Try to pull my status, but they couldn't fake it.
