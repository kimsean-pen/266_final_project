No need to feel ashamed
There's nothing to be gained
When your dreams are in the past

Like stars, we crash and burn
Only to return
Life goes by so fast

So who is left to blame
Nothing's quite the same
We can't live in the past

I'm burning as hot as the sun
And I've only just begun
Love, it fades so fast

Sometimes I forget
All I will regret
When I leave this world behind

Sometimes I'm not sure
What I'm fighting for
It happens all the time

I know I've had enough
Maybe far too much
It's easy to be blind

When it's just me and you
I know what I have to do
I can leave this world behind

No need to feel ashamed
There's nothing to be gained
When your dreams are in the past

Like stars, we crash and burn
Only to return
Times they change so fast

Sometimes I forget
All I will regret
When I leave this world behind

Sometimes I'm not sure
What I'm fighting for
It happens all the time
It happens all the time
It happens all the time
