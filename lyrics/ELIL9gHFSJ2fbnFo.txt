I was torn but I am brave
The future in my hands
Mistakes were made
And I was torn
I will fulfill my fortune
You can't stop me

Shatter the blank spots as I rip through my life
Fractions of time all slip and fly by
Onto the next one and onto the new
Visions of trials I trace to thinking of you

I remembered a thought in the eye of a storm
A pressure an instant the stability worn
Treading in the wake what do I deserve
Capture a glimpse until I'm overturned

I was torn but I am brave
The future in my hands
Mistakes were made
And I was torn
I will fulfill my fortune
You can't stop me

Blocked from start and I try to unfold
When I'm stepping out into the unknown
There's a part of me that just can't relate
So I'm turning my demons into saints

Am I inviting or am I disguised
Are you living the dreams the ones that keep you alive
I see myself begging for only the worst
You know that I love you but you know that I'm cursed

I just can't relate
Turning my demons into saints
I'm begging for only, for only the worst
You know that I love you but you know that I'm cursed
I'm fucking cursed

I was torn but I am brave
The future in my hands
Mistakes were made
And I was torn
I will fulfill my fortune
You can't stop me
You can't stop me
You can't stop me

I just can't relate
Turning my demons into saints
I'm begging for only, for only the worst
You know that I love you but you know that I'm cursed
I'm fucking cursed
