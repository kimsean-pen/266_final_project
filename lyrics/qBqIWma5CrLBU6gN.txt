Staring at the speaker on the telephone
I'm drowning but he's singing all the words
I don't want the world to see me now
Little by little, I'm stepping out

When the walls come tumbling down
Will the stones explode, so bury me
In giants, we believe they're watching, watching
Tiny arms in the sea floating open
Let it stir to live upfloat
I'm the giant sleeps
in silence, I will dream on

Just another face in just another crowd
Waiting for it all to turn upside down
Another sunny day inside a crystal ball
Shake it up
Shake it to make the snow fall

When the walls come tumbling down
Will the stones explode, so bury me
In giants, we believe they're watching, watching on
Tiny arms in the sea floating open
Let it stir to live upfloat
I'm the giant sleeps
in silence, I will dream on

In giants we've believe they're watching, watching
Tiny arms in the sea floating
Let it stir to live upfloat
I'm the giant sleeps
in silence, I will dream on

In giants, we believe they're watching, watching
Tiny arms in the sea floating open
Let it stir to live upfloat
I'm the giant sleeps
in silence, I will dream on
