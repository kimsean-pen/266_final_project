You push me when I'm falling
And you kick me when I'm down
I guess I missed my calling
Cause I should have been a clown

How much more
How much more could I stand
When you're pouring water
On a drowning man

Put me on the right track
And then you let me down
Stab me in the back
Yes, you do, baby
Everytime I turn around

Criticize my love, won't you try
Just try to understand
You're pouring water
I got to tell you bout it
On a drowning man

You're pouring water
On a drowning man
You treat me like
The fool that I am

You planned it out
Like everything you do
You put salt in my wound
It's sad but it's true

You warm me with your kissing
Then you leave me in the cold
How can I know your wishes
Wanna hear you tell me

When I never been told, alright

I cried in mercy, baby
Just try to understand
You're pouring water
I got to tell you bout it
On an old drowning man, yeah

You're pouring water, ha ha
You see I'm a drowning man
Oh, I got tears in my eyes
I'm a drowning man

Don't let me drown, oh, baby
I'm a drowning man
