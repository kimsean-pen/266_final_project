I'm alone in a crowded room
Conversations that I'll never remember
Trapped in reality
That shouldn't be, that shouldn't be

Show me the way (The way)
Allow me to see cause my heart is broken
Be my escape (Escape)
Allow me to hear with a word unspoken
Oh I am separated from the one I was made to love

I'm pathetic and lost
They are so separating
I am the one who had control
You are upon me

This dark is closing in
It's just beginning
This dark is closing in
It's just beginning

Show me the way (The way)
Allow me to see cause my heart is broken
Be my escape (Escape)
Allow me to hear with a word unspoken

Oh let me feel this love again
Let me feel this love again
Oh I am separated from the one I was made to love
If you were simply simple you'd see that I'd stay

What is this life void of love?
It's not a life at all
What is this life void of love?
Can you feel your heart as it hits the ground?

Can you feel your heart as it hits the ground?

This dark is closing in it's just beginning
This dark is closing in it's never going to end
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...
How do you expect me to trust you

When everything you say is a lie?
I'm sticking up for my friends I can count on
This is loyalty, this is a family
This is a family

This is my family
