High heels clack in the alleyway
Lipstick cinnamon gum
Dreaming at the back of the classroom
Mother never understood
Dance with me
Before you leave
When you're gone
Stay clean
We are the young
We are the reprobate
We have the day to sleep the pain away
Standing alone in the black light
Breakdown bathroom exchange
Living the night like you're missing
Mother never sleeps when you're gone
Dance with me
Before you leave
When you're gone
Stay clean
We are the young
We are the reprobate
We have the day to sleep the pain away
