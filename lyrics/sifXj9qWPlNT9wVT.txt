We're all alone I'm moving closer now
I need to feel you running through my veins
A straight shot piercing through my skin
It's not enough, I need to drink you in
My lungs are hot and begging for more air
But my body is half-way there
And waiting for the beating of my heart
To catch up 'til we shake

Please don't tell me that your leaving now
Stay and bury yourself in me

He said please just don't stop
Please don't stop until I'm screaming your name
It's a headspin until were both insane again
Don't stop 'til I'm screaming your name
He said I just won't stop
I won't stop 'til your screaming my name
It's a headspin until were both insane again
Don't stop 'til I'm screaming your name

(I smell your skin on mine)

Hold me closer and pull me under
With our fingers interlocked
As we're blurring the lines
It's been a long day
I'm in a bad way
Give it to me
I need to know you're mine
Steady hands
'Cause we've been here before
I want it all
Not wasting time so give me some more
I want it now
Stay and bury yourself in me

He said please just don't stop
Please don't stop until I'm screaming your name
It's a headspin until were both insane again
Don't stop 'til I'm screaming your name
He said I just won't stop
I won't stop 'til your screaming my name
It's a headspin until were both insane again
Don't stop 'til I'm screaming your name

My body aches, my body shakes
I try to scream but nothing comes out
My body aches, my body shakes
I try to scream but nothing comes out
Melting into submission
I feel the sweat drip it blurs my eyes
My body aches, my body shakes
I try to scream but nothing comes out

He said please just don't stop
Please don't stop 'til I'm screaming your name
It's a headspin until were both insane again
Don't stop 'til I'm screaming your name
He said please just dn't stop
Please don't stop 'til your screaming my name
It's a headspin until were both insane again
Don't stop 'til I'm screaming your name

He said I just won't stop
I won't stop 'til your screaming my name
It's a headspin until were both insane again
Don't stop 'til I'm screaming your name

My body aches, my body shakes
I try to scream but nothing comes out
