All of this means nothing
D.C. made me and the rest of this mess
You don't even try to fake it
All of this means nothing
D.C. made me and the rest of this mess
You don't even try to fake it
Don't even try
I'm here because i was ready to leave
This should mean more but it can't
D.C. made me and the rest of this mess
You don't even try to fake it
D.C. made me and the rest of this mess
You don't even try to fake it
Don't even try
I'm here because i was ready to leave.
This should mean more, but it can't.
Go dance
I was ready to leave
This should mean more, but it can't.
So dance, dance
Dance to the sounds of
America's best dressed fake-out.
I was here, I was ready to leave
This should mean more, but it can't, can't
So dance, dance
To the sounds
To the sounds
So dance
To the sounds of
America's best dressed fake-out.
