Should I close my eyes and prophesize
Hoping maybe someday come?
Should I wet the ground with my old tears
Crying over what's been done?

Should I lift the dirt and plant the seed
Even though I've never grown?
Should I wet the ground with the sweat from my brow
And believe in my good work?
My good work, my good work, my good work.

Hey there, I'm flying up above
Looking down, on the tired earth
But I can see
I can see potential
Speaking through you
Speaking to you
From all of heavens possibility

Power, hey do you know how it work?
Hey do you know that the meek
They shall inherit the earth
But you should work
You should work
Yeah for yourself and the family

Should I hit the water or stay on dry land
Even though I never swam?
Take machete into the brush
Though at first there is no plan
Taste the warpaint on my tongue
As it's dripping with my sweat
Place my gaze in the futures path
Seeing things that ain't come yet

Hope to watch the victory dance
After the days work is done
Hope to watch the victory dance
In the evening's setting sun
Hope to watch the victory dance
Over many lives to come
Hope to watch the victory dance
In the evening's setting sun

Setting sun, setting sun, setting sun!

Hope to dance the victory dance
After the days work is done
Hope to dance the victory dance
In the evenings setting sun
Hope to dance the victory dance
Over many lives to come
Hope to dance the victory dance
In the evenings setting sun

Setting sun!
