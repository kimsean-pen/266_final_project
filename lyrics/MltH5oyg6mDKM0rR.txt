Your heartache is not forever
It's another road that we walk together
And our lives become much stronger
As the world goes on much longer
I wandered far to find the answers
What keeps me alive while taking chances

When you're always almost lonely
You forget to take it slowly

There's a fire
In the heartland
We dance around it like the wild things in the night
There's a fire
In the heartland
We dance together like we're wild things in the night

I met you in the midst of madness
You pulled me out then followed me in
To the night where we both wander
'Til our world goes on much longer
I'm hoping for a light in the dark
It's getting closer, it's who we are

When we're almost always lonely
We forget to take it slowly

There's a fire
In the heartland
We dance around it like the wild things in the night
There's a fire
In the heartland
We dance together like we're wild things in the night

Smoke in the distance
It pulls me inside it
We dance round the fire in time

There's a fire
In the heartland
We dance around it like the wild things in the night
There's a fire
In the heartland
We dance together like we're wild things in the night
Wild things in the night
We dance together like we're wild things in the night
