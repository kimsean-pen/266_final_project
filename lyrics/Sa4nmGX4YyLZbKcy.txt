I want to cut through my skin
And pull you within
My heart burns like the sun
As our flesh becomes one

In the darkness
My heart aches at the sight of you
Trembles and quakes within sight of you
In the darkness

Our bodies burning
Tides are turning
Somehow stopping time
What is becoming of my heart and mind?

In the darkness
All that you want from me
Is all I have to give
In the darkness
Coming so easily
Learning how to live
In the darkness
All that you want from me
Is all I have to give
In the darkness
Coming so easily
Learning how to live

I will surrender my soul
And give you control
Make me a martyr for love
Till the habits abide

In the darkness
My heart aches at the sight of you
Trembles and quakes within sight of you
In the darkness

Our bodies burning
Tides are turning
Somehow stopping time
What is becoming of my heart and mind?

In the darkness
All that you want from me
Is all I have to give
In the darkness
Coming so easily
Learning how to live
In the darkness
All that you want from me
Is all I have to give
In the darkness
Coming so easily
Learning how to live

In the darkness
All that you want from me
Is all I have to give
In the darkness
Coming so easily
Learning how to live

In the darkness
All that you want from me
Is all I have to give
In the darkness
Coming so easily
Learning how to live
