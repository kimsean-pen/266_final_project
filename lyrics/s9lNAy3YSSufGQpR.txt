Listen now thee: Caesar to me
Christians are speaking of pain
Open shall I
The gate beyond high to the astral domain

Gates must not be opened
Nothing but the flow
Is for us to follow
Here me now

There used to be a temple
In Jerusalem
That shall reach the heavens
Once again

Palace dreams
Of ancient might
Bring the past
Through time to the light

Let's build a temple!
Caesar, we hear
Let's build it now

Let's build a temple!
Future and past
Unite the world

Congress of the truth
Within the temple walls
One day soon shall triumph
Holy, holy majesty

Palace dreams
Of ancient might
Bring the past
Through time to the light

Let's build a temple!
Caesar, we hear
Let's build it now

Let's build a temple!
Future and past
Unite the world

Time
Rise through time
The given sign
Always to remember thee divine

Hail!
We all hail
May it prevail
Temple of new Jerusalem.
