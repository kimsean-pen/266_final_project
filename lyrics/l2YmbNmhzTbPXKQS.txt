Woken up by voices in your head, panic sets in you
Paralyzed from the neck down, cold sweat running through
Words start lurking in controlling you

Eyes start turning white, body began to move
Fade off fear fade in smile, consumed with unknown manic desires

Killing spree, body counts, accomplished
What have I turned into
