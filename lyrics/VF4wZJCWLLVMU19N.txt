Looks just like the sun
Looks just like it
Looks just like the sun
Looks just like it
But it looks just like the sun
Looks just like it
But I'm breathing, thinking one...

Heart is pounding in his chest
Reaches suddenly for his gun
Should be sailing in the west
Flower that could be his fun

(keep going)

Tree of families on his head
Weary red, split open eyes
I'm on the corner, thinking 'bout my bed
Ain't just in store and signifies

(one, two, three)

Looks just like
And it looks just like it
Looks just like the sun
Looks just like it
Looks just like the sun
And it looks just like it
But I'm breathing, thinking one...

(here we go)

Gold and red the colours change as you can't forget
Turning back, you know I thought I knew, thought I knew someone
You better check your watch
I think it's time you left

To he, and darkness - still it's obvious to everyone
Darkness, still - it's obvious to everyone
Still it's obvious to every

Well it looks just like
Looks just like it
Looks just like the sun
Looks just like it
Looks just like the sun
(kevin after this)
Looks just like it
(here we go, kev)
Looks just like the sun
