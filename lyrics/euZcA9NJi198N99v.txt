My life tethered like
Like a twin or a son
Scared to be severed right
Right before we begun
Doubled like a couple, we stood
Stood out in the light, light
Crutching each other like
Knuckles turned white, white

I cried wolf
Howling at the moon
So left me dead
Break that mirror in two
I made us feel
Feel unlucky too
So left me dead
Break that mirror in two

Our love twisted up
Like a chick or an egg
We swear ankles that
That always were late
Excuses for the bruises we wear
Black and blue now, now
Breaking each other like
Knuckles in a fight, fight

I cried wolf
Howling at the moon
So left me dead
Break that mirror in two
I made us feel
Feel unlucky too
So left me dead
Break that mirror in two

Cry, cry wolf
I don't know what this howling will prove
Cry, cry wolf
I don't know what I'm gon, what I'm gonna lose
Cry, cry wolf
I don't know what this howling will prove
Cry, cry wolf
I don't know what I'm gon, what I'm gonna lose

I cried wolf
Howling at the moon
So left me dead
Break that mirror in two
I made us feel
Feel unlucky too
So left me dead
Break that mirror in two

Cry, cry wolf
I don't know what this howling will prove
Cry, cry wolf
I don't know what I'm gon, what I'm gonna lose
Cry, cry wolf
I don't know what this howling will prove
Cry, cry wolf
I don't know what I'm gon, what I'm gonna lose
