Feet to hip
Nave to breast
Throat to brain
and skin arrange

Now we're one soul

Through my great arteries
to every blade of grass, a universal path
in
a primal energy
where creation is borne, on sympathetic chords

Hearing Adam's murmur
a Sanskrit alphabet
unholy apple tree
seven flowers

Feet to hip
Nave to breast
Throat to brain
and skin arrange

I fall inside my trance
I tap my heart to test
harmony within
a merciful connection

Hearing Adam's murmur
a Sanskrit alphabet
unholy apple tree
Seven flowers

Feet to hip
Nave to breast
Throat to brain
and skin arrange

Feet to hip
Nave to breast
Throat to brain
and skin arrange

Now we're one soul
