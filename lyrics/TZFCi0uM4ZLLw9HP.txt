I went to the beach
I felt, I felt nothing
I listen to beats
I felt, I felt nothing

I went to a bar
I felt, I felt nothing
I tow down my car
I felt, I felt nothing

When I watched the hills
I felt, I felt nothing (uh, uh)
I swallowed some pills
I felt, I felt nothing

But you wake me up
I was just sleepwalking
You wake me up
Was just another sleepwalker
Bring me back to the land of living

You wake me up
I was out of my mind
I was just sleepwalking
But you bring me to life, baby
You wake me up
I was out of my mind
Was just another sleepwalker
Bring me back to the land of living

Tequila and lime
I felt, I felt nothing
My card was declined
I felt, I felt nothing
They made me a star
I felt, I felt nothing
I broke a few hearts
I felt, I felt nothing

Caught in in my skin
I felt nothing
I did it again
I felt, I felt nothing

But you wake me up
I was just sleepwalking
You wake me up
Was just another sleepwalker
Bring me back to the land of living

You wake me up
I was out of my mind
I was just sleepwalking
But you bring me to life, baby
You wake me up
I was out of my mind
Was just another sleepwalker
Bring me back to the land of living

I was out of my mind
I was just sleepwalking
But you bring me to life, baby
You wake me up
I was out of my mind
Was just another sleepwalker
Bring me back to the land of living

I was just sleepwalking
You wake me up
Bring me back to the land of living
You wake me up
