Streets are crowded but life is so vacant
There's nowhere to go
Stepped outside in the light but couldn't take it
There's nothing to know

You gotta wait it out
But I'll take some time
Be good to yourself
And then clear your mind
When all of this is far behind
Long ago

Every time you show me your soul
I only ever stare at the bullet holes
Remembering the times when you lost control
Still sitting in your seat when the credit rolls
Gun control

Could get out if you had a car
Drive up to the coast
Instead of hanging round the sae old bars
And feel like a smoking ghost

Like you wanted to die
But you didn't want to
Like you wanted to try
But then pushed it through

Remembering all the love we felt
You're the reason I wear a safety belt

Every time you show me your soul
I only ever stare at the bullet holes
Remembering the times when you lost control
Still sitting in your seat when the credit rolls
Gun control

(Why not listen to the youth when you need them?
Why resist to see the future when you see it?
When you know the past is already gone and it's already done
Now put your faith in the young!)
