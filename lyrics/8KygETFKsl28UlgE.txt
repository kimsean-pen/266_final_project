Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute
Uh huh, sure, you know you look kinda familiar
Yeah, you do too but um... I just wanted to know
do you know somebody named... you know his name
Oh yeah definitely, I know his name
I just want to let you know that he's mine
Uh, no no, he's mine

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

I think it's time we got this straight
Sit and talk, face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man
Are you insane

See I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me

See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me
He couldn't make it through the day
Ain't that a shame

Well maybe you misunderstood
Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All of my love was all it took

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

Must you do the things you do
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me not you
And if you didn't know it, girl it's true

I think that you should realize
Try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside

You can say what you wanna say
What we have, you can't take
From the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake

When will you get the picture
You're the past, I'm the future
Anyway it's my time to shine
If you didn't know it the boy is mine

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

Can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games, I won't allow
The boy is mine, without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel

What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
This special places in my heart
Cause he was my love, right from the start

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine
He belongs to me (sang in)
The boy is mine, not yours (after)
Not yours
But mine
Not yours
But mine
Not yours
But mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine
