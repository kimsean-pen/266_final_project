Far beyond
You come from a distant land
We're not like you
You'd never understand

Yeah, I'm in town
For the day again
You tell me how
Your spouse has been
Yeah, I'm in town
But my head is not

I'm counting down to blastoff
Down to blastoff
Down to blastoff
Down to blastoff

Flying on
Curses the cause of trend
We don't concern ourselves
With offensive mortal men

But I'm in town
For just the night
You tell me how
Your children fight
Yeah, I'm in town
But my head is not

I'm counting down to blastoff
Down to blastoff
Down to blastoff
Down to blastoff

Think I got somewhere to be
Think I got somewhere to be
Think I got somewhere to be

Yeah, I'm in town
For the day again
You tell me how
Your spouse has been
Yeah, I'm in town
But my head is not

I'm counting down to blastoff
Down to blastoff
Down to blastoff
Down to blastoff

I'm in town
For an hour now
Can you meet
To talk about
Parallel
Space and time
