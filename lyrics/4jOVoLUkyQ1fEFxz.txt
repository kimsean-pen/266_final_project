Oh comely
I will be with you when you lose your breath Chasing the only
Meaningful memory you thought you had left
With some pretty
Bright and bubbly
Terrible scene that was doing her thing on your chest
But oh comely
It isn't as pretty as you'd like to guess
In your memory you're drunk on your awe to me
It doesn't mean anything at all
Oh comely
All of your friends are all letting you blow
Bristling and ugly
Bursting with fruits falling out from the holes
Of some pretty
Bright and bubbly
Friend you could need to say comforting things in
your ear
But oh comely
There isn't such one friend that you could find here
Standing next to me he's only my enemy
I'll crush him with everything I own
Say what you want to say and hang for your hollow ways
Moving your mouth to pull out all your miracles aimed
For me
Your father made fetuses with flesh licking ladies
While you and your mother were asleep in the
trailer park
Thunderous sparks from the dark of the stadiums
The music and medicine you needed for comforting
So make all your fat fleshy fingers to moving and
Pluck all your silly strings and bend all your notes for me
Soft silly music is meaningful magical
The movements were beautiful all in your ovaries All of them milking with green fleshy flowers
While powerful pistons were sugary sweet machines
Smelling of semen all under the garden
Was all you were needing when you still believed in me
Say what you want to say and hang for your
hollow ways
Moving your mouth to pull out all your miracles aimed
For me
And I know they buried her body with others her
Sister and mother and 500 families
And will she remember me 50 years later I
Wished I could save her in some sort of time machine
Know all your enemies
We know who are enemies are
Know all your enemies
We know who our enemies are
Goldaline my dear we will fold and freeze
together
Far away from here there is sun and spring and green forever
But now we move to feel for ourselves inside some stranger's stomach
Place your body here let your skin begin to blend
itself
With mine
