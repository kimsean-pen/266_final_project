Called you yesterday
You didn't answer your phone
The main drag is knowing that
You probably weren't alone
Wanna call you, everyday
Beg you to be near me
I know your head is underwater
I doubt that you can hear me

So let the rain come down
The rain come down
Let the rain come down, down
Let the rain come down
Rain come down
Let the rain come down, down

You've been gone seventeen days
Seventeen long nights
The main drag is knowing that
You're holding someone else tight
I want to to call you everyday
And beg you to be near me
But I know your head is underwater
I doubt that you could hear me

Let the rain come down
Rain come down
The rain come down, down
Rain
Little baby now
Ha, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Talkin' 'bout seventeen days
Ha, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

You've been gone seventeen days
Seventeen long nights
Oh it's a drag baby and I know
Holding another nigga tight
I want to to call you everyday
Beg you to be near me
I know it's underwater
I doubt that you could hear me

So let the rain come down
Come on down
Let the rain come down, down
Ho, ho, oooh
Come down
Come down
Yeah, hey, oooh, oooh
Come down, down

Ha, ha, ha,
Ha, ha, ha, ha ha

Yeah,

Woah hooo hoooo
