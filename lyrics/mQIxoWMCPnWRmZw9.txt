Forgive me someone, for I have sinned
And I know not where I should begin
And some days it feels like you just can't win
No matter what you do or say.

Things didn't kill me but I don't feel stronger
Life is short but it feels much longer
When you've lost the fight yeah you've lost that hunger
To pull yourself through the day.

But if ever I stray from the path I follow
Take me down to the English Channel
Throw me in where the water is shallow
And then drag me out back to shore!

'Cos love is free and life is cheap
As long as I've got me a place to sleep
Clothes on my back and some food to eat
Then I can't ask for anything more

So come on everybody sing it 1, 2, 3, 4

So we all have secrets that we hold inside
Yeah the worst little things that you never confide
The worst one of all that you just can't hide
Is that you're never quite as strong as you sound

So I'm sorry baby, for the times I've hurt you
Sorry friends, for the times I desert you
Most days it feels like I don't deserve you
And I wonder that you're all still around

So if ever I stray from the path I follow
Take me down to the English Channel
Throw me in where the water is shallow
And then drag me out back to shore!

'Cos love is free and life is cheap
But as long as I've got me a place to sleep
Clothes on my back and some food to eat
I can't ask for anything more

Come on everybody sing it 1, 2, 3, 4

Come on and join me in the water
We'll swim for hope
Sometimes it's hard to remember
I couldn't do this on my own

So if ever I stray from the path I follow
Take me down to the English Channel
Throw me in where the water is shallow
And then drag me out back to shore!
'Cos love is free and life is cheap
As long as I've got me a place to sleep
Clothes on my back and some food to eat
I can't ask for anything more
I can't ask for anything more

The path I chose isn't straight and narrow
It wanders 'round like a drunken fellow
Some days it's hard for me to follow
But if you've got my back I'll go on.
If you've got my back I'll go on
