I ran like a speeding train
Cut my hair and changed my name
Only had myself to blame
For the company I was keeping
Curse my restless wandering feet
Prone to wander endlessly
All the love you gave to me
It wasn't enough to keep me
Oh, I stole from my father all I thought I could sell
Tossed his copper, and I watched as it fell
But there wasn't any water in the wishing well
Bent my knee to many kings
Idols of prosperity
Heard that dollar calling me
So I sought it in the city
Oh, I stole from my father all I thought I could sell
Tossed his copper, and I watched as it fell
But there wasn't any water in the wishing well
For my soul, he made an offer
And to the dust again I fell
And oh, that devil's got a hold on me now
Because there wasn't any water in the wishing well
