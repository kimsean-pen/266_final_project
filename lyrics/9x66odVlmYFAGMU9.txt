Shower me with sparks
Ignore my broken heart
Kiss me then retreat
And I will do the same
For we are young we are free now
Push me hold me down
Give but don't be found
Touch but do not feel
And I will do the same
For we are young we are free now

Your lips taste like tears yet
There's no taste I know that's sweeter

Keep me in the dark
Have me to yourself
Leave before the morning breaks
Pretend we've never met

Your lips taste like tears yet
There's no taste I know that's sweeter

Come to me right now
Wipe the sweat from brow
Help me to forget
And I will do the same

Your lips taste like tears yet
There's no taste I know that's sweeter
