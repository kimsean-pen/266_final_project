Using me everyday
Wishing you'd realize and stay
But no one is better than him

You look at me and you turn away
Wishing you'd smile at me everyday
But no one is better than him

I don't need you
You spit me out again

I don't need you
You spit me out again

Buy you stuff and it's diamond black
You tell me you'll buy me stuff back
But you never bought anything for me

I take you home from a perfect night
You thanked me and then you left my sight
But no one is better than him

I don't need you
You spit me out again
I don't need you
You spit me out again
