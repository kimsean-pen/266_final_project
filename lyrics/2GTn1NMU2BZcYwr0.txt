Met up last week at a cover band bar
It was too loud to speak so we got in your car
And we rode 'round the block with your playlist on
RapCaviar and your favorite song, yeah

And we talked about how you're gonna throw that kegger
The first day back of our fall semester
And I know I might've come across annoyed
But you look like a man and talk like a boy
And now we've already said everything
Everything
It's time to use our lips for better things
Can we hit mute?
Hit mute
And let our bodies do what they do
Baby, can we hit mute?
Hit mute
No, not another word out of you
Baby, can we hit mute?
Baby, can we hit mute?
Now, all of my friends have got a lot to say
And your roommates are not shy about the way
They hear us talkin' dirty through the walls of the kitchen
So they blast Call of Duty on the surround sound system
Now we've already said everything
Everything
It's time to use our lips for better things
Can we hit mute?
Hit mute
And let our bodies do what they do
Baby, can we hit mute?
Hit mute
No, not another word out of you
Baby, can we hit mute?
Baby, can we hit mute?
Baby, can we hit mute?
In the living room, on the sofa
In the passenger seat of your Nova
In a corner booth, on the dance floor
No matter where, we don't care if they can hear us
Hit mute
Hit mute
And let our bodies do what they do
Baby, can we hit mute? (In the living room)
Hit mute (On the sofa)
And let our bodies do what they do
Baby, can we hit mute? (In a corner booth)
Hit mute (On the dance floor)
No, not another word out of you
Baby, can we hit mute? (In the living room,
on the sofa, in the passenger seat of your Nova)
Baby, can we hit mute? (In a corner booth, on the dance floor)
