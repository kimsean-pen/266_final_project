Heard you're new in town
Want someone to show you 'round
Well no-one knows this place just quite like me
Well I don't, hang with the crowd
Where I go, we're dressing down
I'll take you where the music plays for free

So don't rely on people you meet
Cause no-one is safe in these streets

I'm gonna take you out tonight
I'm gonna make you feel alright
I don't have a lot of money
But we'll be fine
No, I don't have a penny
But I'll show you a good time
I'm gonna take you out tonight
I'm gonna make you feel alright
I don't have a lot of money
But we'll be fine
No, I don't have a penny
But I'll show you a real good time

So what do you think so far
Is it all you're hoping for
Does it live up to your every dream
Or do we disappoint
While you make the choice
When you wake up can you hear a scream

So don't rely on people you meet
Cause no-one is safe in these streets

I'm gonna take you out tonight
I'm gonna make you feel alright
I don't have a lot of money
But we'll be fine
No, I don't have a penny
But I'll show you a good time
I'm gonna take you out tonight
I'm gonna make you feel alright
I don't have a lot of money
But we'll be fine
No, I don't have a penny
But I'll show you a real good time

Cause I know how it feels to be alone
When strangers only make you feel apart
You never, ever felt so far from home
You never felt so far from home

I'm gonna take you out tonight
I'm gonna make you feel alright
I don't have a lot of money
But we'll be fine
No, I don't have a penny
But I'll show you a good time
I'm gonna take you out tonight
I'm gonna make you feel alright
I don't have a lot of money
But we'll be fine
No, I don't have a penny
But I'll show you a real good time

I'm gonna take you out tonight
I'm gonna make you feel alright
I don't have a lot of money
But we'll be fine
No, I don't have a penny
But I'll show you a good time
I'm gonna take you out tonight
I'm gonna make you feel alright
I don't have a lot of money
But we'll be fine
No, I don't have a penny
But I'll show you a real good time
