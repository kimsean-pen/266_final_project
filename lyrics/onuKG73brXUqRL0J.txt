Fire, take me there
Burning all the strands of my life
Smoke and the cinder ash
Kindred ties of mine

Feeding the fire
Reaching for the smoke ascending
Losing time
Waking in the cold

Hold still the flaming child
Feeding on this pain of mine
Cradled by ashen hands
Risen from the grave

Feeding the fire
Reaching for the smoke ascending
Losing time
Waking in the cold

Unscathed and cold
Tearing for love

Feeding the fire
Reaching for the smoke ascending
Losing time
Waking in the cold

Feeding the fire
Reaching for the smoke ascending
Losing time
Waking in the cold

Save me before it takes my love
Save me before it takes my love
