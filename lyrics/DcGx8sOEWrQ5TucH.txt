Make it a time
make it anytime
make sure that it's not the only kind
that others find

I've got half a mind
I've got a mind
With fishing line

To shut down the whole system at the spine
it's only a stab in a wet paper bag
I'm really glad there's a grasp to grab

I wrote a song
but life goes on
is that so bad?

It was slow and long
I wrote the words and the music wrong
and on and on and on and on and on and on
