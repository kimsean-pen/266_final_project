Nursery stories out of rhyme
Chasing faces lost in time
Seven children dream of sleep
Losing count of hours to keep
Singing songs from yesterday
It's got to feel so good to get away
Lonely Hearts Club left behind
There's no shame in pain, there's only

Time rider
He's just a whisper away from you
Paris is turning
We drip like the rain tonight

Broken watches keep the time
Chasing heartbeats just like mine
Every streetlight deep in glow
Blinking blue, green and yellow
Singing songs of yesterday
It's got to feel so good to get away
Lonely Hearts Club left behind
There's no shame in pain, there's only

Time rider
He's just a whisper away from you
Paris is turning
We drip like the rain tonight
Time rider
Can I take your hand?
I want to ride with you
Into the storm

Broken engines burning gas
Every moment from my past
Making time for being late
Buried neatly under gates
Singing songs of things to come
It's got to feel so good to come undone
Lonely Hearts Club left behind
There's no shame in pain, there's only

Time rider
He's just a whisper away from you
Paris is turning
We drip like the rain tonight
Time rider
Can I take your hand?
I want to ride with you
Into the storm
