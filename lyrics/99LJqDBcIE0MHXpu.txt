So here it is again
Rape and pillage proves
To win the public vote

Someone tell me who will take the prize
And who takes the fall

So confused
When you're lost in the groove
So confused
When you're lost in the groove

And down-town comes again
And her masks are shifting like a chameleon
Someone tell me why she breaks my fall
And then breaks my heart

So confused
When you're lost in the groove
So confused
When you're lost in the groove

Wow!
So confused
When you're lost in the groove
So confused
When you're lost in the groove
