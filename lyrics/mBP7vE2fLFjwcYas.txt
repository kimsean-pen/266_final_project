Do You Feel So Blue In Your Shiny Red Car?
Will You See Your Friends Burn With You In The Fire?
Standing Alone On A Beach
Slipping Away From The World
Or Did You Find Your Heaven Pass Beside The Road?
Oh Red Car
Now That Your World Is So New
Hang The Tears From Your Grave
Spend My Nights Driving In Circles
Can I Still Feel The Same?
Steering Off Of This Road
The Flames Become Glass
The Shadow In The Distance
You'll Never Pass
Oh Oh Red Car
Oh Baby Girl
