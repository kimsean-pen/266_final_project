I was raised to believe
All, all that I read
Fall in line with me
It's all, all that I see

Got a box of lies
Gonna get you high
With the words of wisdom that you need to hear

Got a big ass book
And I'm not a crook
But I'll take your guilt in the form of dollars

Got a box of lies
Gonna get you high
With the words of wisdom that you need to hear

Got a big ass book
And I'm not a crook
But I'll take your guilt in the form of dollars

Fall in line with me
It's all that I see
What I believe
(It's all that)

Fall in line with me
It's all that I see
What I believe
(It's all that)

It's all that I see

Keep my fingers crossed
I wanna be somewhere that I belong
(Never fold under pressure)
Keep my fingers crossed
I wanna be somewhere that I belong
(Never mind how I got there)

Never mind how I got there
