As the serpent swallows its tail
So the cycle never ends
A perfect balance, so pure yet so frail
Our inner soul defends
We realise that the pictures broader
We see the grand design
To everything there is an order
The circles but one line
But first we must control the dreams
Filter the corrupt without
We find then all is as it seems
Once we shed our doubt
We see the truth fivefold
Unwrap before our eyes
We see the elements of old
Across the virgin skies
Fire and Water, Earth and Air
The building blocks of all
But spirit too, is everywhere
The power to enthrall
The land below, the moon on high
Reflections of a truth now lost
But still she shines bright in the sky
Ignorance our ultimate cost
Some things deep down we know are true
However history lies
Her powerful light will still shine through
Unseen by the rationally wise
In seasons past what people knew
Was taken from their hands
To be understood by the chosen few
And thus control the lands
We feel the ancient energy
Course within our veins
The past defamed his effigy
But still the truth remains
Join the wild dance and feel the joy
The shadows in the wood
Maligned by those who would destroy
Our spirit if they could
They do not want us to be free
To reach up for the stars
They fear just what we could be
If we accept the birthright thats ours.
