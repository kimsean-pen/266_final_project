Only in madness, do you find beautiful death
And only in sadness, do you feel happy instead

Be careful what you wish for 'cause you don't know
The guilt I carried this far all on my own
It's nothing you wanna feel

Don't wait for the dust to settle, don't wait till it's not enough
Don't wait for the world to let go of the both of us
Don't wait for the dust to settle, don't wait till you've had enough
Don't wait for the world to let go or to give you up

The silence is one thing that I'll remember you said
Well, it's better than nothing when nothing's all that you left

Be careful what you wish for 'cause you don't know
The guilt I carried this far wasn't my own
It's nothing you wanna feel, so let it go

Don't wait for the dust to settle, don't wait till it's not enough
Don't wait for the world to let go of the both of us
Don't wait for the dust to settle, don't wait till you've had enough
Don't wait for the world to let go or to give you up

If you need a place to hang your head, a shoulder's better than a knot
You'd be a better memory alive rather than not
If you need a place to hang your head, a shoulder's better than a knot
You'd be a better memory if no one else forgot
So let it go

Don't wait for the dust to settle, don't wait till it's not enough
Don't wait for the world to let go of the both of us
Don't wait for the dust to settle, don't wait till you've had enough
Don't wait for the world to let go or to give you up

If you need a place to hang your head, a shoulder's better than a knot
I'm not giving up
You'd be a better memory alive rather than not
So don't you give up
If you need a place to hang your head, a shoulder's better than a knot
I'm not giving up
You'd be a better memory if no one else forgot
So don't you give up
