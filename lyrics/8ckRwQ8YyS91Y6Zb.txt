Koreema knows that just what it is she does
It can't be hard for her to get a buzz
Down in the street below
Hear the drunken archangel sing
I know what's on your mind, my boy
Just I can see, oh everything
Lead pipes, they're fortune made
Well, take a tip from me
Climb up to her window ledge or you'll forever be

Just walking under ladders as the people round you hear you crying please
As the people round you hear you crying please
Please

Lead pipes are fortune made
Well, take a tip from me
Climb up to her window ledge or you'll forever be

Just walking under ladders as the people round you hear you crying please
As the people round you hear you crying please
Please, please

Who really knows that just what it is she does
It can't be hard for her to get a buzz
The rapture of vertigo and letting go
But me myself, I was never sure
Was it liquor or was it my soul?
