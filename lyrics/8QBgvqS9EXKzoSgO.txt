Loneliness's my friend
My self-built land
Until the end

Rain clouds, darkness, coldness, I'm satisfied
Hate and anger, fear is my guiding light
Hope for your sign, send me a light, rescue my soul, set me free

On my way to the unknown
Send me a light
You've got to show me the way
Hearing my plea
Don't leave me alone
Into the unknown
Send me a light
Show me the way don't leave me astray
Send me a light
Out of my night

Take my hate away
Let pain astray
Show me this way

Night falls, dark dreams, blackness comes over me
Endless sorrow, this is what I can see
See me bleeding, don't go away, leave me alone, in my night

On my way to the unknown
Send me a light
You've got to show me the way
Hearing my plea
Don't leave me alone
Into the unknown
Send me a light
Show me the way don't leave me astray
Send me a light
Out of my night

Curse the darkness, for I can free my soul
Freedom calls me, I won't be left alone
Dreaming your dreams, could be reality
You are my dream, see what I've seen and come with me, into light

On my way to the unknown
Send me a light
You've got to show me the way
Hearing my plea
Don't leave me alone
Into the unknown
Send me a light
Show me the way don't leave me astray
Send me a light
Out of my night

On my way to the unknown
You've got to show me the way
Hearing my plea
Into the unknown
Show me the way
Send me a light
