Make your move, obvious humor
Desperate in respiratory plight
Always on, dressed to impress
I'll be the last one to find out why

Time takes its toll on us
(this changes everything)
I'd be a liar if I denied you at all
Oh, Now that I know
this changes everything

I've been trading ideas with intriguing men and I
I perceive an honest solution to all of your crime

Time takes its toll on us
(this changes everything)
I'd be a liar if I denied you at all
Oh, Now that I know
this changes everything

Oh, now that I know
Oh, now that i know

And the amplifier screams out loud
For the last time
Wave your hands at the audience
As you sink on in
Fast chance to hide
You need desperately so
I need so

Motion gives up on you in the end
I'll try my best to be home by then
You'll see the grace we had
She'll never have
You'll never have

I'm going home by my own way
Going home by my own
I'm going home by my own way
Going home by my own

I would really love if you'd sit him down
I would really love if you'd sit him down
I would really love if you'd pull this thread
I would really love if you'd pull this thread
I would really love if you'd sit him down
I would really love if you'd sit him down
I would really love if you'd pull this thread
I would really love if you'd pull this thread
