Your star is bright and glowing
You had so much to show me
No matter where you're going
Your star is bright and glowing
The less you say the more you show, you show, you show, you show, you show
The less you show the more you disappear
A part of you is all we know, we know, we know, we know, we know
A part of you is in the atmosphere
You've got a message from the stars, the stars, the stars, the stars, the stars
A transmission through the stratosphere
Was it a daydream born on Mars, on Mars, on Mars, on Mars, on Mars?
A sound or vision from a future year
Your star is bright and glowing
You had so much to show me
No matter where you're going
Your star is bright and glowing
Felt like a notion from the one, the one, the one, the one, the one
Turn the lights on and it disappears
You radiate just like the Sun, the Sun, the Sun, the Sun, the Sun
The fire burns although the spark is gone
You got a message through the stratosphere
A part of you is in the atmosphere
You got a message through the stratosphere
Burn like a star and then you disappear
Don't, don't, don't leave us stranded here
Don't, don't, don't leave us stranded here
Don't, don't, don't ever disappear
Don't, don't, don't ever disappear
You got a message through the stratosphere
