My Baby
I know I made you angry
But you love me
I love the way you kiss me
Kiss me once bo
Before you live angry
'Cause i love you
So won't you forgive me now

Maybe i broke a couple little promises
Just way i'll make you forget
Give me one chance
You see
I love so strong
No one will ever bring you harm
Once you are back in my arms
Where you're suppose to be

My Baby
I know I made you angry
But you love me
I love the way you kiss me
Kiss me once bo
Before you live angry
'Cause i love you
So won't you forgive me now
