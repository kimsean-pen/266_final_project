I'm a flickering flame without your touch
I need something to believe in
Laying deep where the concrete meets the rush
I need something to believe in

I'm not waiting any longer
You give me something - something to believe in
I can't shout it any louder
So give me something - something to believe in

I am floating on a wave in the atmosphere
Give me someone with a reason
Spiralling out there's no doubt it'll all disappear
So give me something to believe in

Tomorrow is another day
