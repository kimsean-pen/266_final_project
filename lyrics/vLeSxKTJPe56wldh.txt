are you drifting, there is nowhere to go
life support is down and your systems low
are you cruising on your secondary cells
waiting for the bell (oh do you really think so)

flat line you're illusory mind
dreams are for the bold and you're not that kind
disappointment has a house on that road
best to stay at home (oh do you really think so)

you're safe and warm inside
your chances pass you by
the question fills your mind
are you caught in a slipstream
are you lost in the fog
can you see through the windscreen
are you sure it's safe to follow somebody's taillight
are you already lost
when you get to the daylight
when you recognise the world you walked across

are you listening with your head in the sand
drown the words you don't want to understand
'til the song stops, is it safe to come out
nobody's about (oh do you really think so)

too late now there's nowhere to go,
life support is down and your systems low
and your fuel light said you'll never get home
now you're all alone (oh do you really think so)

you're scared to stay inside
your chances pass you by
the question fills your mind

penny for the dreams you thought you'd lost
penny for the dreams you thought you'd see
penny for the price you thought it cost
penny for the one you thought you'd be
pity for the times you kept it all
pity for the wealth you thought you'd get
pity for the day your empire falls
pity for the day your life got caught

are you caught in a slipstream
are you lost in the fog
can you see through the windscreen
are you sure it's safe to follow somebody's taillight
are you already lost
when you get to the daylight
when you recognise the world you walked across
