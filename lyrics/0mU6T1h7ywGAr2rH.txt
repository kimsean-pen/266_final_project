I'm the troubled one
I'm mom's neurotic son
Scared of everyone but they're talking and they're watching me
I've been on the run
I don't miss where I come from
They all think I'm the greatest
I'll let them down when I don't make it

Wake me up when I'm famous
I'm on the wrong side of the bed
I'm trying to be patient
But I'll stay asleep instead

I've been everywhere, man, Winnipeg to Amsterdam
I'll take what I can get but I'm missing the little things, yeah
Good friends are moving uptown
my sister's grown up now
Birthdays and graduations
I'll let them down when I don't make it

I've seen all the lights burn out
While wondering what life is all about

Wake me up when I'm famous
I'm on the wrong side of the bed
I'm trying to be patient
But I'll stay asleep instead

Wake me up when I'm famous
I let the air out of my head
I'm trying to be patient
But I'll stay asleep instead

Wake me up when I'm famous
I'm on the wrong side of the bed
I'm trying to be patient
But I'll stay asleep instead

Wake me up when I'm famous
I'm on the wrong side of the bed
I'm trying to be patient
But I'll stay asleep instead

Tell the world that I'm waiting
I let the air out of my head
I'm trying to be patient
But I'll stay asleep instead
But I'll stay asleep instead
