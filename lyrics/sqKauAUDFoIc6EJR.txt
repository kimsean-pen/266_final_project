So are we lost or do we know
Which direction we should go
Sit around and wait for someone
to take our hands and lead the way

Cause every day we're getting older
And every day we all get colder
We're sick of waiting for our answers

Wake up, Wake up, Wake up,
Yeah so tired of waiting, waiting for us to
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up,
Yeah so sick of waiting, for us to make a move

Are we meant to take the pain
Should we sit around and wait
Are we being saved
Or was I another lie you made to make us hate

Cause every day we're getting older
And every day we all get colder
We're sick of waiting for our answers

Wake up, Wake up, Wake up,
Yeah so tired of waiting, waiting for us to
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up,
Yeah so sick of waiting, for us to make a move

Wake up, Wake up, Wake up,
And we will never lose
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up,
it's time to make a move
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up,
And we will never lose
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up,
it's time to make a... move!

It's not enough
To let it run
Where's the truth
It's all wrong

So sick of waiting for our answers...

Wake up, Wake up, Wake up,
Yeah I'm so tired of waiting, waiting for us to
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up,
Yeah I'm so sick of waiting, for us to make a move

Wake up, wake up, wake up
And we will never lose
Wake up, wake up, wake up
It's time to make a move
Wake up, wake up, wake up
And we will never lose
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Make a move (move, move, move, move).
