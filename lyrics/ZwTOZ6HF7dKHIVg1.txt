The Capitone Diary, Hi, welcome back
Four to Uranus, date, stars
I continued my search for good living conditions
Until the resources almost ran out
Instead of going home, I found myself in a fantasy
I went up a bit, lost gravitation
The parting left a black hole in the heart the size of Asia
So I started again in front of the galaxy
Tess
Where? To "unknown"
Alone and not calm
The heart is very wounded, yet it moves
Longing is the worst power
I do not fight him and he does not remain submissive
Continues, searching, with the cruise, with the stress
What comes along the paths is for me the best
So, order thewest, enter the quest, search, climb
Drop the barks and knock, yo

Alone, confused
Facing a vague future
Who would say, if at all
(We are all lost in space)
Sometimes it is not easy
Do not feel so miserable
Come with me, that's a shame
(We are all lost in space)

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la

The Capitone Diary, my Loneliness continued
Four something for Saturn, stars, date
I do not have the faintest idea where to turn or what to do
I'm a hitchhiker in the galaxy without a guide
He takes air and remembers the hard nights
Everyone is looking to do, to impress
Discover, fulfill, blame
And do a lot of noise
Lost people in space
Zoom-out, view above
He understands that my alone is not alone at all
Religions, parties, sects, tribes
Lights, signs, fear
I forgot I could enjoy myself
From the landscape, from the river, the infinity before me
I'm Lust, I'm boss, I'm here, I'm alive
WALK If Time flies – then only First Class
Like Siggy Stardas I put gas ... Bye!

Alone, confused
Facing a vague future
Who would say, if at all
(We are all lost in space)
Sometimes it is not easy
Do not feel so miserable
Come with me, that's a shame
(We are all lost in space)

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la

A million politicians say they know everything
And not yet admitted
We are all lost in space
And many again about home, origin or religion, right and left
So let's get to life
We are all lost in space
We are all lost in space
We are all lost in space
We are all lost in space
We are all lost

Hey Hannah, my darling does not matter
We drink coffee in the mother of stars
We are Gaoyens but we are never alone
Raise your head early – you are a planet
