You traced your hands across my back
You whispered, if time could only take us back
Would you take me back
Would you?
Would you?
Would you?
Would it take me back?
Would it take me back? (Would you?)
Would it take me back?

I left the lakes I knew to follow you
Harbored the lines I'd lost
To see us through
Only to be with you (Would you?)

Remember Cologne
When it's late at night
You're all alone
You're not feeling right
Can you see the lights?
Are we losing sight?
Are we losing sight?
Are we losing sight? (Would you?)

Remember Cologne
When it's late at night
You're all alone
You're not feeling right
Can you still see the lights?
Are we losing sight?
Are we losing sight?

You shed a skin
You used to live within (Would you?)
Running from nights
You couldn't live again
Trying to find a friend (Would you?)

Remember Cologne
When it's late at night (Would you?)
You're all alone
And you're not feeling right (Would you?)
Can you see the lights?
Are we losing sight? (Would you?)
Are we losing sight?
Are we losing sight?

Remember Cologne (Would you?)
When it's late at night
You're all alone (Would you?)
And you're not feeling right
Can you see the lights? (Would you?)
Are we losing sight?
Are we losing sight? (Would you?)
Are we losing sight?

In the dark
Will you stay
'Till the dust
Turns to flames?
This forgotten love
Our forgotten love (Would you?)

Remember Cologne
When it's late at night (Would you?)
You're all alone
And you're not feeling right (Would you?)
Can you see the lights?
Are we losing sight? (Would you?)
Are we losing sight?
Are we losing sight? (Would you? Would you?)
Are we losing sight? (Would you? Would you?)
Are we losing sight? (Would you?)
We'll be alright (Would you?)
We'll be alright (Would you?)
We'll be alright (Would you?)
We'll be alright (Would you?)
