I've been up past noon
My clouds make faces out of you
But I'm waiting for the sun

Thoughts of being in your arms
As I hugged your material ones
Your scent began to fade

I'm tired of feeling so confused
Stop changing your mind
Telltale Signs

Just wanna lie here all day with you
Backseat of your car
Count the stars

Thought you always knew
How I felt when I'm next to you
But you threw it all away

It's not too late to get out of
This mess before you disappear
Lose yourself again

I'm tired of feeling so confused
Stop changing your mind
Telltale Signs

Just wanna lie here all day with you
Backseat of your car
Count the stars

Maybe I'll take the longer way home
Get a little lost but at least I know
Maybe I'll take the longer way home
Anything for you even if I'm cold

Maybe I'll take the longer way home
Get a little lost but at least I know
Maybe I'll take the longer way home
Anything for you even if I'm cold

Break my heart but at least I know

I'm tired of feeling so confused
Stop changing your mind

Just wanna lie here all day with you
Telltale Signs
