Little hope,
little home of heavenly.
Come and save us from this ugly truth.
Little hope,
sprung from necessity.
May all good things in life come to you.

Little ghost, so innocent and carefree
They would never stop hunting you
Little voice, life got the best of me
And in time that's what awaits you too

Little hope, sing a song of fire
I grow up to be just like that
(little hope, little hope)
Sing a song of fire.

I've seen the truth and it's nothing like you said
I've seen your picture of a perfect world
Now you can touch the halo around my crowned head
So many questions, so many things unsaid.

I've seen the truth and it's nothing like you said
I've seen your picture of a perfect world
Now you can touch the halo around my crowned head
So many questions, so many things unsaid.

I've seen the truth and it's nothing like you said
I've seen your picture of a perfect world
Now you can touch the halo around my crowned head
So many questions, so many things unsaid.

I've seen the truth and it's nothing like you said
I've seen your picture of a perfect world
Now you can touch the halo around my crowned head
So many questions, so many things unsaid.

I've seen your picture of a perfect world

So many questions, so many things unsaid.

I've seen the truth and it's nothing like you said
I've seen your picture of a perfect world

Little hope, sing a song of fire
I grow up to be just like that
(little hope, little hope)
Sing a song of fire
(waited all my life)

Little hope, love is sung inside
If you want, you'll dream of life now
(little hope, little hope)
Sing a song of fire.

I've seen the truth and it's nothing like you said
I've seen your picture of a perfect world
Now you can touch the halo around my crowned head
So many questions, so many things unsaid.

I've seen the truth and it's nothing like you said
I've seen your picture of a perfect world
Now you can touch the halo around my crowned head
So many questions, so many things unsaid.

I've seen your picture of a perfect world
Now you can touch the halo around my crowned head
So many questions...
