Lonely, lonely
So you think that you know me
You're the only one who knows who I am

I decided to let that I'm breaking
All the chains on my throne, imperfection
Could it be that easy to let it all go?

Everything you see that glitters
Isn't always gold
Everything you think it's perfect
Isn't always, oh
Many times, many times I would've let my feelings show
Everything you see that glitters
Isn't always gold

You know I'm just human, human, human after all
You know I'm just human, human, human after all

Slowly, slowly
I'm okay in revealing
Scars you see, I wear them proud in the end

I decided tonight that I'm wasting
Too much thought on the art of perception
Could it be that easy to let it all go?

Everything you see that glitters
Isn't always gold
Everything you think it's perfect
Isn't always, oh
Many times, many times I would've let my feelings show
Everything you see that glitters
Isn't always gold

You know I'm just tired of the way, of the world on my shoulders
Baby, you know I'm sick of always carrying it for you
Used to be a superwoman, now that's over, over
I'm a lover, I'm a lover, baby, I'm a soldier
Doesn't mean that I could be everything for you
Used to be a superwoman, now that's over, over
Everything you see that glitters
Isn't always gold
Everything you think it's perfect
Isn't always, oh
Many times, many times I would've let my feelings show
Everything you see that glitters
Isn't always gold
You know I'm just human, human, human after all
You know I'm just human, human, human after all
