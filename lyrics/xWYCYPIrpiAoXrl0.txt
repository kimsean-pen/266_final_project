Sunkissed, skin it makes me feed into your mind tricks
Your eyes are ocean blue but I'm sea sick
Of all your pretty lies on your lipstick
Cryptic so cryptic
All my life want to take it over
All my life want to take it over
Stranger do me the most,
look into my eyes be the holy to my Ghost, bless me your strange love
Baby where's the dirty love that you mentioned,
you make me start to question my own patience,
I'm waiting ona knife to come an save me, save me, please save me
All my life want to take it over
Stranger do me the most,
look into my eyes be the holy to my Ghost, give me that strange love
Hold me give me a kiss, wake me from this dream of a never ending pit
Bless me your strange love
All my life want to take it over
All my life want to take it over
All my life want to take it over
All my life want to take it over
All my life want to take it over
