see me look unveiled
when i walk out of the canyon
and see me start to climb
at the end of day
but who's there to see me walk out?
there's no beacon
no sun to block out
no bird of blaze
a close dark voice says
"do you really think there's anybody out there?"

so what?
no one sees me
what do i care
now the black night has seized me
on a mountain's mane
i climb to my claim
and i am aimless alone and unraveling
and above barren wastelands stare at me
they know my name
"what do you want?"

oh i know i'll be in the air
and that my trail passes lion's lairs
and i see summits buried in more air
buried in space
there's no end in sight

how many times have i learned this before?
how many times have i made up this song before?
how many times have i died up here before?
and oh how hidden tomorrow morning is
what heavy fog
what wide shadows
