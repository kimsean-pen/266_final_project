They carved your name in your neighbor's door, and it's blood on blood
Just making sure that he's the score, but it's blood on blood
We're gearing up for a holy war, it's either them or us
So ship 'em off to another shore
But it's still blood on blood

Where's the world we're dreaming of?
'Cause I'm waking up
It's funny how we show our love
Oh, we need a better blood on blood

A novel take on an ancient book, and it's blood on blood
A scimitar or shepherd's crook, it's still blood on blood
The billy club or the booted foot they buried in your gut
Maybe it's time for another look at all this blood on blood

Where's the world we're dreaming of?
'Cause I'm waking up
It's funny how we show our love
We need a better blood on blood

We all pretend we're civilized, but it's blood on blood
You say it's sanctioned and sanitized, but it's blood on blood
Don't have to look in the devil's eyes or see his infant son
Just like a boat from the bluest skies, but it's still blood on blood

Where's the world we're dreaming of?
'Cause I'm waking up
It's funny how we show our love
We need a better blood on blood

Where's the world we're dreaming of?
'Cause I'm waking up
It's funny how we show our love
We need a better blood on blood
We need a better blood on blood
We need a better blood on blood
