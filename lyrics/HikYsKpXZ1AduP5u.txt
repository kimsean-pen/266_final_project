So go ahead and weep
And join the hurt
You know a million sheep
Would be dispersed
By one lion's roar
By one lion's roar

I just step aside
For every God knows
Everything will crumble
Under his blouse
You think yourselves weak
But (?) It can overrun
And then all you bled for
Is coming undone

So go ahead and weep
And join the hurt
You know a million sheep
Would be dispersed
By one lion's roar
By one lion's roar

You go out there
And bow to none
And cause a (?) word
Last one
Curse them into hiding
These thieves won't believe
The way we're riding
