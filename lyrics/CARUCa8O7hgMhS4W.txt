I like you, hey! I like you, hey!
I like you and for real ever baby
I like you
If you like me, too
We're in for the big time
We're right on
I stand up
I'm wondering
What you said
I like you
I'm right on
You can never, never tell you
No, no, no, no, no, no
I like you
If I am for real, am for real, maybe, I like you
i like you, if you like me too...
And forever time, I will do anything
That you do too
I will do anything you do too
I will find any reason
I'm right on, I stand up
I can never, never tell you
I like you, hey! I like you, hey!
