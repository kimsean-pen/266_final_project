I see the stain in the people now
See the stain and I will
Feel the stain in the people now
Deep dark grey fades into blue
Nothing doing how sad who knew
Deep blue turns into grey and
Nothing turning it seems to stay

A fragrance the masking hue
These eyes that cling to you
Faked clean and washing through
They seem to want something new

Fleeting, wanting, holding
I can't be here in my way again
Well you see, in a way
It's a feeling like falling, it's lonely
And I can't see floor through my feet again

Seem okay, feel okay
See the stain in the people now
First the mass it weighs a ton
He says many I say none and
Keep saying it should hold but
Feel faulted got to go

These things will stay awhile
These stairs go up a mile
These things will stay awhile
Best start in single file

Fleeting, wanting, holding
I can't be here in my way again
Well you see, in a way
It's a feeling like falling, it's lonely
And I can't see floor through my feet again

In the sea, in a wave
Crashing, rolling, it holds me
And I can't be here in my way again
