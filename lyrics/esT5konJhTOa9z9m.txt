Pulsing of the drone
Drag of the feet
Gun looking at gun
Fall out from the heat
Not lately
Not lately
I haven't seen you for some time
I haven't seen you for some time
Brought back from the dead
Down on the floor
See it in your eyes
Beatcity once more
Not lately
Not lately
I haven't seen you for some time
I haven't seen you for some time
There's nobody else
There's no one left alive
Used to find you here
Used to count the dead
Tragic as it seems
Said it keeps the edge
Not lately
Not lately
I haven't seen you for some time
I haven't seen you for some time
Not lately
Not lately
Not lately
Not lately
Not lately
Not lately
