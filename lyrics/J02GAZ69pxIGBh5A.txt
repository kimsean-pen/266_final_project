Floating on the water
Ever changing
Picture hours out from that
Into with all our dreams

The ocean takes me
Into watch you shaking
Watch you weigh your powers
Tempt with hours of pleasure

Take me one more time
Take me one more wave
Take me for one last ride
I'm out of my head

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight I
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
Tonight (We ride)

Cruising through the city
After hours
With me fusing all our powers
Here's to all our

Take me one more time
Take me one more wave
Take me for one last ride
I'm out of my head

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight I
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
Tonight (We ride)
