Got that stupid kind of love
Get all crazy when I feel your touch
I don't know when or where it was
All eyes be cool and fell for ya

Loving the way you are
High enough
Don't care 'bout playin' a fool for you
You got me caught up on the things you do
Girl, I'm addicted to you

I need you, babe
You rock and rule
You're super cool
Girl, I been sayin' phrases I don't use
You groovy baby
Why you so smooth?
You rock my world
Oh, you make me lose my cool

I'm all caught up in the rush
Get excited every time I see ya
I don't wanna call it love
Whatever it is, is unfamiliar

Loving the way you are
High enough
Don't care 'bout playin' a fool for you
You got me caught up on the things you do
Girl, I'm addicted to you

I need you, babe
You rock and rule
You're super cool
Girl, I been sayin' phrases I don't use
You groovy baby
Why you so smooth?
You rock my world
Oh, you make me lose my cool

All in around the world I never seen
Nobody quite like you
I just might crown you and make you my queen
'Cause baby, you're the truth

Loving the way you are
High enough
Don't care 'bout playin' a fool for you
You got me caught up on the things you do
Girl, I'm addicted to you

I need you, babe
You rock and rule
You're super cool
Girl, I been sayin' phrases I don't use
You groovy baby
Why you so smooth?
You rock my world
Oh, you make me lose my cool
