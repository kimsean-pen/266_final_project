woo hoo hoo hoo
woo hoo hoo hoo
She called me late last night
To say she loved me so
It didn't matter anymore
I say she never cared and that she never will

I'd do it all again
I guess I'll have to wait until then
And if I get drunk well, I'll pass out on the floor now baby
You won't bother me no more
And if you're drinkin' well, you know

That you're my friend and I'll say
I think I'll have myself a beer.
Woo hoo hoo
Woo hoo hoo
She called me late last night, to say she loved me so

But I guess you changed her mind.
Well I should have known it wouldn't be all right
But I can't live without her
So I won't even try
And if I get drunk well, I'll pass out on the floor now baby

You won't bother me no more
And if you're drinkin' well, you know
That you're my friend and I'll say
I think I'll have myself a beer.
Maybe some day, I'll think of what to say.

Maybe next time I'll remember what to do (do)
She looks like heaven, maybe this is hell
Said she'd do it all again, she'd
Promise not to tell!
And if I get drunk well, I'll pass out on the floor now baby

You won't bother me no more (she said!)
It's ok boy cause you know we'll be good friends
And I'll say, I think I'll have myself a beer.
I think I'll have myself a.
Wooooah oooooh oooooh woah...
Wooooah oooooh oooooh woah...
Wooooah oooooh oooooh woah...
Yeah yeah yeah!
Woo hoo hoo hoo
Woo hoo hoo hoo.
