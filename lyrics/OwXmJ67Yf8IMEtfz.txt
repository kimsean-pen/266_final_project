Wake up with me sleeping silent
Let it sink under your skin, sink under your skin
Look at me like it's a lesson
On how to take it all in, take it all in
Like I'm romanticizing every gesture
And love I thought you knew me better
As I string together every letter

I'm not one to make love
But I'm down to give a fuck
I'm not one to make love
And I'm always giving you
I'll stay frozen under your eyes
Stay hidden under disguise
Can't remember what it feels like
To be surprised
Lay awake for a while

Wake up with me still and silent
Wishing I was somewhere else
Wonder why I always capsize
And internalize each moment
As it play out
I'm not romanticizing every gesture
Love I thought you knew me better
While I string together every letter

I'm not one to make love
But I'm down to give a fuck
I'm not one to make love
And I'm always giving up
I'll stay frozen under your eyes
Stay hidden under disguise
Can't remember what it feels like
To be surprised
Lay awake for a while

I spend the night
Reviewing captured constellations
And in the morning I lie
Reliving tiny revelations
Fixated and shameless

I spend the night
Reviewing captured constellations
And in the morning I lie
Reliving tiny revelations
Fixated and shameless

I'm not one to make love
But I'm down to give a fuck
I'm not one to make love
And I'm always giving up
I'll stay frozen under your eyes
Stay hidden under disguise
Can't remember what it feels like
To be surprised
Lay awake for a while
