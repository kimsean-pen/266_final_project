(J.Buckley)

There's no easy answer, none to blame or forgive.
Two cripples dancing to the end we lie.
I'm not with you, not of you.
Not with you, not of you.
You are soft and young to me
I am the ghost who comes and goes
And I hope I'll catch you in the throws
Of one last look at the wonder,
One last look at the wonder.
Oh, God, I love you
And all the past we once knew
Some other love becomes you
Whatever else we come to
I know we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be
You are soft and young to me
I am the ghost who comes and goes
I'm hoping that I'll catch you in the throws
Of one last look at the joy that we've become.
But there's no easy answer, none to blame or forgive.
We were two cripples dancing, to the bitter end we live.
I'm not with you, but of you.
I'm not with you, but of you.
Oh, God, I loved you
And all the past we once knew
Some other love becomes you
Whatever else it comes to
I know we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be
We had a birthplace in common
We had separate beds and lives.
I know we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be
I know we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be
Yeah, oh.
