The Exiters -:- Tell him

I know something about love. You've gotta want it bad.
If that guy's got into your blood, go out and get him.
If you want him to be the very part of you.
That makes you want to breathe, here's the thing to do.

Tell him that you're never gonna leave him.
Tell him that you're always gonna love him.
Tell him, tell him, oh, tell him, tell him right now.

I know something about love. You gotta show it and
make him see the moon up above, reach out and get him.
If you want him to be always by your side.
If you want him to only think of you.

Tell him that you're never gonna leave him.
Tell him that you're always gonna love him.
Tell him, tell him, oh, tell him, tell him right now.

Ever since the world began, it's been that way for man.
And women were created to make love their destiny.
So why should true love be so complicated? Oh yeah, Oh-oh.

I know something about love. You gotta take his hand.
Show him what the world is made of, one kiss will prove it.
If you want him to be always by your side.
Take his hand tonight, swallow your foolish pride.

And tell him that you're never gonna leave him.
Tell him that you're always gonna love him.
Tell him, tell him, oh, tell him, tell him right now.

Oh, you gotta go now
(tell him that you're never gonna leave him) oh, yeah
(tell him that you're always gonna love him) yeah
(tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now)
Don't you let him go, now
(tell him that you're never gonna leave him) oh, yeah
