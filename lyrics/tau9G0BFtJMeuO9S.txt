Lori Glory you're on the list
Beware of what's coming
Though hard to resist
Lori Glory
Like a fly drawn to light
You met me at the airport
You were such a sight
I said nothing and then nothing and then nothing
And then you said "The man that I love
Loves you, so I will love you too"
Lori Glory
In the back seat of a cab
Did I dream that you kissed me?
Lori, I'm so sad
Men claim the right of living
Of climbing, fighting and flying
They claim the right of living
So you became an expert on dying
Men took all the decisions
About what and why and how and when
You learned the part of refusals
And you played it very well
Lori Glory
Like a fly drawn to light
At all the bars where you took me
You were the queen of the night
Lori Glory
Why is there love
Why do we stand all this pain
When there's no help from above?
Lori Glory
My bags are packed
Our last walk across Manhattan
Such a balancing act
You gave me access to the world of hangovers
You were it's irresistible Miss
You were the princess of leftovers
Of course you could spare a kiss
Lori Glory
My beautiful friend
Don't give up on me yet and
I'll stay with you 'till the end
Lori Glory
The girl that I like
Promise to fight harder
Next time they strike
