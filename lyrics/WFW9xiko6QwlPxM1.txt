The cottage is windswept
Now there's only sorrow here
Follow evacuation signs

You're detached and broken
and so sentimental now
Remembering how we passed our time

Somebody waits for me
Far beyond our Halloween

Germanic forces marching on concrete squares
Our love is just defenceless sound
And could we believe that all you said was true
We would be so determined now

Somebody waits for me
Far beyond our Halloween

Slowly emerging Dividing Germany
Everyone's lost in East Berlin
Only believing just what you want to hear
We're waiting at stations once again

Somebody waits for me
Far beyond our Halloween

Somebody waits for me
Far beyond our Halloween
