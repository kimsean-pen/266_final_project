Forgive me father, forgive me God
I know I've sinned with no remorse
Apocalyptic visions went through my head
Here today, gone tomorrow

It's all insane
I'm feeling sick, I'm feeling numb
The storm will come
In the name of God, I'm the chosen one

Terror raids the land
To ashes we'll be sent
In the name of God
Lives cast away

Martyrdom of myself
Armageddon comes
In the name of God
Not one more dead

Fire blasting, cutting edge
Children burn in flames
In the name of God
We're going insane

Let us die
You don't realize
This is the time
God's sacrifice

Leaving behind
Lesson in hate
In the name of God
We're all dead

Burn!
