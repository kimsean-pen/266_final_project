Is this a riot or are you just pleased to see me?
Why aren't we holding hands and talking sweet?
I love you really though I know no one believes me
There's chaos every time we meet

Oh now look what
you've gone and done
You're creating
pandemonium
That song you sing
means everything
to me
I'm living in ecstasy
The stars and the sun
dance to your drum
and now
it's pandemonium

You're crashing everywhere, it's like you're smashing china
skidding on an icy road
In major trouble since you were almost a minor
I sometimes think we'll both explode

Oh now look what
you've gone and done
You're creating
pandemonium
That song you sing
means everything
to me
I'm living in ecstasy
My world's gone mad
What did you do?
I'm telling perfect strangers
that I love you
The stars and the sun
dance to your drum
and now
it's pandemonium

I can't make sense of anything
all I know is the party's in full swing
If we both just stopped for a minute
I'd declare war and then you'd win it

To tell you the truth I thought I was shock-proof
until I saw what you get up to
When you think about it, it's quite an achievement
that after all I still love you

Oh now look what
you've gone and done
You're creating
pandemonium
That song you sing
means everything
to me
I'm living in ecstasy
My world's gone mad
What did you do?
I'm telling perfect strangers
that I love you
The stars and the sun
dance to your drum
and now
it's pandemonium
