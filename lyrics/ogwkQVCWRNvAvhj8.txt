I am unused
Spit not chewed
Seal kept unbroken
Please come
Hear my tongue
Have your way with me

This will never do
No, this will never do
Cursed

Yeah
Such a waste
Vomit if you get a taste
It's the death of me
Rockstar I don't wanna be
Such a waste
Faceplant if you get the pace
You're the death of me
Rockstar I don't wanna be

Without rule
Black not blue
Flowing
In torrent
Please come
Take my tongue
Have you way with me
Take it

This will never do
No, this will never do
Cursed

Yeah
Such a waste
Vomit if you get a taste
It's the death of me
Rockstar I don't wanna be
Such a waste
Faceplant if you get the pace
You're the death of me
Rockstar I don't wanna be

Stuck in my own way
Old habits
Stuck in my own way
Old habits
Stuck in my own way
Old habits
Stuck in my own way
Old habits
Stuck in my own way
Old habits
Stuck in my own way
Old habits
Stuck in my own way
Old habits
Stuck in my own way
Old habits
Stuck in my own way
Stuck in my own way
Stuck in my own way
I'm stuck in my own way
Old habits

Such a waste
Vomit if you get a taste
It's the death of me
Rockstar I don't wanna be
Such a waste
Faceplant if you get the pace
You're the death of me
Rockstar I don't wanna be
(I don't want to be)
Rockstar I don't wanna be
(I don't want to be) I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
