Under the white chalk
Drawn on the black board
Under the x-ray
I'm jut a vertebrate

Do that to me
Do that to my anatomy
Do that to me
Do that to my anatomy
Corporeal Corporeal

We are mankind
We are manikin
With and without mind
With or without Darwin

Classify me
The strings of my autonomy
Classify me
The strings of my autonomy
Corporeal corporeal

A thorny red heart
Around a thin arm
Inside a white bone
The love is inborn

Close up to me
Up close to my anatomy
Close up to me
Up close to my autonomy
Corporeal corporeal
Corporeal
