I know you know
There's nowhere to go
Your eyes deceive your mind

Now you will do as you are told
Always here
With the thoughts you have sold me

You came to me
Could not see through me
I showed the world to you

Now you won't question my plan
So quickly
I've got you in the palm of my hand

Always in thought control
Like bullet holes
You're mine to control

I hear voices
They leave no choices
They tell me what to tell you

Now you'll follow every word
Listen close
To everything you have heard

Always in thought control
Like bullet holes
Your mind to control

Let's hide out in Death Valley
