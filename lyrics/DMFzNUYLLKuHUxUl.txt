Sadly, I walk around this place on the shells of eggs
My shoulders are cold
I put it off for so long, I put it off
And know I've got to live with what I made
Forever

What was stolen from us
Now is forever lost
Just because we'll never pay the ransom
What was taken from me
I will never regain just because
We'll never pay the ransom

I'll become like the desert wind
And I'll drink all the gin
Shriveled up under desert lights
Eaten up in the night
I can't keep this up much longer without
Needing more from you
I need more

Wasted with the rhythm
Angry at the melody
How did you stay so sweet?
Cause you were my ally once
You were my confidante
I need somebody close
To be close to
Forever

What was stolen from us
Now is forever lost
Just because we'll never pay the ransom
What was taken from me
I will never regain
Just because we'll never pay the ransom
Just because we'll never pay the ransom
