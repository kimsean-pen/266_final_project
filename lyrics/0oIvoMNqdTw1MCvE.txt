Lay down, close your eyes and I'll take you away
To a place with no tears and no sorrow
Where diamonds are scattered all over the sky
they seem so cold and hollow

Burning bridges,
get ready for things that you call
"life" smoke of fire fills emptiness inside.

Your soul is deep in black water
all that you want is light

It's time to break through the surface to the bright!

Whenever you're sinking do not fear the
unknown, no matter if you're not strong
You still breathe So keep trying!

Just tear off the mask and make it all your own follow the light,
go on...

Drop by drop, you fill the lake which becomes the ocean
Spark in the night can be brighter
than stars
Go, set in fire your emotion

Whenever you're sinking do not fear the unknown
no matter if you're not strong you still breathe
So keep trying!
Just tear off the mask and make it all your own
And follow the light
Go on...
Breathe new life, feell reborn.
You're never alone no matter what's happening take a piece of my heart
and make it your own
Go on...
