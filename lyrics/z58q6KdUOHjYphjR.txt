If I dare to ask you
I dare it to be true
If I dare to risk it
I know that I'm willing to
If I dare to want this
To want more than I have
Than I dare to believe
I'll have it in the end

You climbed the mountain
Send pictures of the view
And still cant believe when
I started climbing too
You havent heard that
I'm not afraid to fall
That I'm not deterred yet
Until I tell them all

I am holding out
For more than what I have now
I'm holding out

I don't want your pity
I won't use your little scraps
I don't build my cities
With what could get taken back
I don't need permission
To rise up when it hurts
You don't have to listen
But you'll hear me, mark my words

I am holding out
For more than what I have now
I'm holding out

When the room gets dark and I am quiet
There's a voice that's soft like someone's silhouette
Saying don't let me go yet

I am holding out
I am holding out
For more than what I have now
I'll hold it out

If I dare to ask it
And I dare it to be true
If I dare to risk it
I know that I'm willing to
If I dare to want this
To want more than I have
Than I dare to believe
I'll have it in the end
