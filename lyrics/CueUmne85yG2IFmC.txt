We both take the hardest punches
And collect black eyes just to prove it
Still we pass by just like strangers
And we speak just like the closest enemies (enemies)

In the shadows of our life
We can fall into the night unscarred
In the shadows of our life
We can never let it go this far

Somehow my words rendered useless
Still I pull my lip down to my chest
Just to show you how my jaw is
Tired from waiting to say the things that you should hear
You should hear

In the shadows of our life
We can fall into the night unscarred
In the shadows of our life
We can never let it go this far

After all
We're still the same
These empty promises
Seem to never change
There's a smile on my face and it's 2:55 a.m.
This cramp in my wrist
Puts me back to sleep till it all comes around again

With a closed fist
With a closed fist
With a closed fist
With a closed fist

In the shadows of our life
We can fall into the night unscarred
In the shadows of our life
We can never let it go this far
In the shadows of our life
We can fall into the night unscarred
