I love you
But I love me more
I want you
But I want peace more

Enough for me to walk away out of forever's door
So I dance with my hands in the wind to beat all alone

I choose me
I choose me
I choose me
I choose me

If I had to choose
I would never lose
I'd choose me

I would never lose
I'd choose me
