Long afloat on shipless oceans
I did all my best to smile
'Til your singing eyes and fingers
Drew me loving to your isle

And you sang
"Sail to me
Sail to me
Let me enfold you
Here I am
Here I am
Waiting to hold you"

Did I dream you dreamed about me?
Were you hare when I was fox?
Now my foolish boat is leaning
Broken lovelorn on your rocks

For you sing
"Touch me not
Touch me not
Come back tomorrow
O my heart
O my heart
Shies from the sorrow"

I'm as puzzled as the newborn child
I'm as riddled as the tide
Should I stand amid the breakers
Or should I lie with Death, my bride?

Hear me sing
"Swim to me
Swim to me
Let me enfold you
Here I am
Here I am
Waiting to hold you"
