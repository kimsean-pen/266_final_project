One song
about a girl
I can't breathe
when I'm around her
I'll wait
here everyday
In case
she'll scratch the surface
She'll never notice

I'm not in love
This is not my heart
I'm not gonna waste these words
About a girl

Whoa!

Last night,
I knew what to say
But you,
weren't there to hear it
These lines,
so well rehearsed
Tongue tied,
and over-loaded
You'll never notice

I'm not in love
This is not my heart
I'm not gonna waste these words
About a girl

I'm not in love
This is not your song
I'm not gonna waste these words
About a girl

To be loved, to be loved
What more could you ask for?

To be loved, to be loved
Everyone wants

To be loved, to be loved
What more could you ask for?

To be loved, to be loved
Everyone...

I'm not in love
This is not my heart
I'm not gonna waste these words

I'm not in love
This is not my heart
I'm not gonna waste these words
About a girl

I'm not in love
This is not your song
I'm not gonna waste these word
About a girl.
