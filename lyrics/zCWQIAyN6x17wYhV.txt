So I was sitting here in a bar
And this guy comes up to me
And he said, "My life stinks"

And I saw his gold credit card
And I saw the way that he was
Looking at people across the room

And I looked at his face
And you know, quite a good looking face
And I just said, "Dude, your perspective on life sucks!"

He's got looks that books take pages to tell
He's got a face to make you fall on your knees
He's got money in the bank to thank
And I guess you could think he's living at ease

Like lovers on the open shore, what's the matter?
When you're sitting there with so much more, what's the matter?
While you're wondering what the hell to be
Are you wishing you were ugly like me

Blame it on the girls who know what to do
Blame it on the boys who keep hitting on you
Blame it on your mother for the things she said
Blame it on your father, but you know he's dead

Blame it on the girls, blame it on the boys
Blame it on the girls, blame it on the boys

Life could be simple but you never fail
To complicate it every single time
You could have children and a wife, a perfect little life
But you blow it on a bottle of wine

Like a baby, you're a stubborn child, what's the matter?
Always looking for an axe to grind, what's the matter?
While you're wondering what the hell to do
We all wishing we were lucky like you

Blame it on the girls who know what to do
Blame it on the boys who keep hitting on you
Blame it on your mother for the things she said
Blame it on your father, but you know he's dead

Blame it on the girls, blame it on the boys
Blame it on the girls, blame it on the boys
Blame it on the girls, blame it on the boys
Blame it on the girls, blame it on the boys

He's got looks that books take pages to tell
He's got a face to make you fall on your knees
He's got money in the bank to thank
And I guess you could think he's living at ease

Blame it on the girls who know what to do
Blame it on the boys who keep hitting on you
Blame it on your mother for the things she said
Blame it on your father, but you know he's dead

Blame it on the girls, blame it on the boys
Blame it on the girls, blame it on the boys
Blame it on the girls, blame it on the boys
Blame it on the girls, blame it on the boys
