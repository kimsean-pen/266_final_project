Tina lies on the ground
She lies there forever
She likes the sun
Tina knows the devil

Tina loves the violence
Of living in the country
She likes that it's
So far from me

Tina has her story down
I really thought I knew it
And it changed around
When I was almost through it

Sunshine on my back is the only kind I like
Sunshine in my brain is the lonely kind of pain
It's the sunshine of a lonely mind

She says "After today then there's nothing you owe me"
And I'm so glad that you came, I needed someone who loves me
But just don't try to talk yourself into this love
And sleep like a baby while I'm staying up
It's as much what you say, as it is what you don't
You can't try to stay you either will or you won't
