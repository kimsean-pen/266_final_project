Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me

It's only been a week
The rush of being home in rapid fading
Prevailing to recall
What I was missing all that time in England

Has sent me aimlessly
On foot or by the help of transportation
To knock on windows where
A friend no longer live, I had forgotten

Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me

And anywhere I go
There's always something to remind me
Of another place and time
Where love that traveled far had found me

We stayed outside till two
Waiting for the light to come back
But hidden talk I knew
Until you asked what I was thinking

Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me

Brave men tell the truth
A wise man's tools are analogies and puzzles
A woman holds her tongue
Knowing silence will speak for her

So now I'll never know
As you will only sleep beside me everywhere I go

Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me

Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me

Will remind, will remind, will remind me
(It's only been a week)
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
(The rush of being home in rapid fading)
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
(Prevailing to recall)
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
(What I was missing all that time in England)

Will remind, will remind, will remind me
(Has sent me aimlessly)
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
(On foot or by the help of transportation)
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
(To knock on windows where)
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
(A friend no longer live, I had forgotten)

Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
