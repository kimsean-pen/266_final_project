Want you, I'll tell you that I don't want
I don't love you, I'll tell you that I don't

Why you always go
Back on the same ol' shit?
Like nothin' that
I ever said was what I really meant
Like none of my promises was honest
I never lie, I never lie
You've already been warned
You know what I be on
I've been the same since day one
I never lie, I never lie

What you, what you trippin' on
Trippin' on, trippin' on me for?
Yeah trippin' out, trippin' over nothin'
I'm always honest
Pause, I don't owe you nothin'
Trippin' on, trippin' on, trippin' on me for?
Yeah trippin' out, trippin' over nothin'
I'm always honest
Pause, I don't owe you nothin'

Yeah, I'm through (I'm through)
Everything's movin' in slow motion (Slow-mo)
Yeah, I'm through (I'm through)
Everything's movin' in slow motion (Slow-mo)

What you, what you trippin' on
Trippin' on, trippin' on me for?
Yeah trippin' out, trippin' over nothin'
I'm always honest
Pause, I don't owe you nothin'
Trippin' on, trippin' on, trippin' on me for?
Yeah trippin' out, trippin' over nothin'
I'm always honest
Pause, I don't owe you nothin'

Go ahead and turn nothin' into somethin'
Go ahead, make yourself look stupid
I don't care what you think the truth is
I mean damn, how many times I gotta prove it?
If I don't want you
I'll tell you that I don't want you
If I don't love you
I'll tell you that I don't love you
If there was someone above you
Then I'd let you know
But that ain't the case, so... (Ayy)

What you, what you trippin' on
Trippin' on, trippin' on me for?
Yeah trippin' out, trippin' over nothin'
I'm always honest
Pause, I don't owe you nothin'
Trippin' on, trippin' on, trippin' on me for?
Yeah trippin' out, trippin' over nothin'
I'm always honest
Pause, I don't owe you nothin'

Yeah, I'm through (I'm through)
Everything's movin' in slow motion (Slow-mo)
Yeah, I'm through (I'm through)
Everything's movin' in slow motion (Slow-mo)
