All of my life waiting for you
Just to be by your side, just to see it through
And you'd call my name, but what would you say
If you knew my play, then who are you
Ooh and you'd come down and anchored stay
And if they told you run
Then why you standing there

All of my life spent on you
Just to be by your side, but you never came
And you'd call my name just to disappear
I've been proven down in a tear
And what if no one comes
No bells to ring, Lord
What if no one came
No tales to sing now

All of my life waiting for you
Just to be by your side, should've been there too
And you'd call my name, but I never couldn't hear
If you knew my play, then you'd never do what you want
It was only a waltz
You'd never do what you'd say
Oh what you'd say

All of my life
All of my life
All of my life
All of my life

And what a dream in my head
Are all those things that you'd say to me
And what a dream will do until it's gone and never come back again
