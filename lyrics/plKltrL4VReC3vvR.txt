Seconds move as fast as the hours do
in between the world I don't have with you
Hearing all the miles that we used to share
my heart is still there

If you found some other love than me
it would tear this one completely
Will you still need me?
How will we carry on?
And on and on

Now that winter's fallen
all of the calm is gone
when the summer stops with the beat of my heart, my heart
Days pass by fade all the clouds are gone
Last raindrop, with the beat of my heart, my heart

Strike away the fears spinnin round in me
They're eating up the truth of our memory
Keep in mind the words so they don't give way
That's what we both say.

If you found some other love than me
it would tear this one completely
Will you still need me?
How will we carry on?
And on and on.

Now that winter's fallen
all of the calm is gone
when the summer stops with the beat of my heart, my heart
Days pass by fade all the clouds are gone
Last raindrop, with the beat of my heart, my heart

Now that winter's fallen
all of the calm is gone
when the summer stops with the beat of my heart, my heart
Days pass by fade all the clouds are gone
Last raindrop, with the beat of my heart, my heart

All I really want is for you to say
somehow, someway
that you'll never give up and slip away.

Now that winter's fallen
all of the calm is gone
when the summer stops with the beat of my heart, my heart
Days pass by fade all the clouds are gone
Last raindrop, with the beat of my heart, my heart

Now that winter's fallen
all of the calm is gone
when the summer stops with the beat of my heart, my heart
Days pass by fade all the clouds are gone
Last raindrop, with the beat of my heart, my heart
