There's a rumbling
In my head
It's getting louder
Louder

There's a shaking
In my bones
It's getting stronger
Stronger

There's a hunger
In my heart
It's full of promise
Promise

There's an itch
Under my skin
It's under my skin
Under my skin

'Cause I just wanna feel something real
'Cause I just wanna feel something

On the pavement
I am looking
For a lover
A lover

And my eyes are rolling
She noticed
She noticed

There's a blood red
On my shirt
And it's shining
Shining

There's a sharp pain
From my face
I kinda like it
I like it

'Cause I just wanna feel something real
'Cause I just wanna feel something real
Wanna feel something

Something

I just wanna love
I just wanna touch
I just wanna see
Something

I just wanna love
I just wanna touch
I just wanna see

'Cause I just wanna feel something real
'Cause I just wanna feel something real
Wanna feel something
