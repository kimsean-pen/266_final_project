Turn around
Look at what you see
In her face
The mirror of your dreams

Make believe I'm everywhere
Hidden in the lines
Written on the pages
Is the answer to a never ending story, ah-ha-ha-ha-ha

Reach the stars
Fly a fantasy
Dream a dream
And what you see will be

Rhymes that keep their secrets
Will unfold behind the clouds
And there upon the rainbow
Is the answer to a never ending story, ah-ha-ha-ha-ha

Story, ah-ha-ha-ha-ha

Show no fear
For she may fade away
In your hands
The birth of the new day

Rhymes that keep their secrets
Will unfold behind the clouds
And there upon the rainbow
Is the answer to a never ending story, ah-ha-ha-ha-ha

Never ending story, ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
Never ending story, ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
Never ending story, ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
