Tell me when you wanna get out
This ceremony's getting me down

Yeah I'll treat him like a comic book
Oh that's what you wanna say
That's all I gotta say

As you know you're right
You meet your maker every night

I'll save you
Oh savior no
I'll save you
Oh savior no
I'll save you
Oh savior no

All I'll say pick me up or I'll levitate
Weigh me down with your
Pearly gates
As you know you can say what you
Want but I don't have a problem...
Save me saviour save me saviour

Amateurs are at it again
Just give me all the rules to the
Game
Swipe left when you wanna get out
That's what you wanna say
That's all I gotta say

I don't feel so calm
A heavy hum that rattles ya heart

I'll save you
Oh savior no
I'll save you
Oh savior no
I'll save you
Oh savior no

All I'll say pick me up or I'll levitate
Weigh me down with your
Pearly gates
As you know you can say what you
Want but I don't have a problem
Save me saviour save me save me again

I'll see you on the flipside
Ceremony is dead
