I don't mind, my heads in the sky
Thinkin' of you (oh), feelin' for you (ohh)
It's cold right now I miss you for life
It's not going away, I thought I'd be okay (yeah)

I still think about the time
The time I spent just tryna grow with you
Baby, I was out of line
But you weren't there, you weren't there

And oh baby, and oh baby, I'm trying
I can't erase your picture from my head
Oh, maybe you took over my mind (you're fine)
I can't erase your picture from my head

I wish you weren't feeling so sad
I feel what you do (oh), I got that from you (ohh)
I shouldn't be so bothered by you
I'd probably be okay, if you just went away (yeah)

I still think about the time
The time I spent just tryna grow with you
Baby, I was out of line
But you weren't there, you weren't there

Oh baby, and oh baby, I'm trying
I can't erase your picture from my head
Oh, maybe you took over my mind (you're fine)
I can't erase your picture from my head

I've been, I've been so guilty baby
I'm thinking about myself and I
I feel like I'm going out my way for you

Oh baby, and oh baby, I'm trying
I can't erase your picture from my head
Oh, maybe you took over my mind (you're fine)
I can't erase your picture from my head
