I found this brand new gift
Looking for somebody to share it with
I found you a brand new ride
Something within me all of my life
There's so much trouble in the world
Surrounded by miracles
So much hatred undeserved
But it will not work

Cuz still our love will be received
Better yet, still my heart is in need of release
Yeah still my love will be recieved
Better yet, still my heart is in need of release

When it ain't about justice
When it's not about what was what is
When it's not about what's left
When it's not about the next step

When it ain't about justice
When it's not about what was what is
When it's not about what's left
When it's not about the next step

I found me a brand new riff
Looking for somebody to play it with
I found this brand new light
Something within me all of my life
There's so much trouble in the world
Surrounded by miracles
So much hatred undeserved
But it will not work

Cuz still our love will be received
Better yet, still my heart is in need of release
Yeah still my love will be received
Better yet, still my heart is in need of release

When it ain't about justice
When it's not about what was what is
When it's not about what's left
When it's not about the next step

When it ain't about justice
When it's not about what was what is
When it's not about what's left
When it's not about the next step

When it ain't about justice
When it's not about what was what is
When it's not about what's left
When it's not about the next step

When it ain't about justice
When it's not about what was what is
When it's not about what's left
When it's not about the next step
When it ain't about justice
