Drowning in an ocean of you
Forty foot waves
Whispering sweet nothings in your bed
Could stay here for days

Gave you all of me I'll never leave
Ways that we could stay between the sheets
Oh but they can't see what you do to me
Doesn't really matter what they say

And they think you don't give enough
But I do, I do
They say I don't really need your love
But I do, I do... I DO

Open ticket to nowhere
is how we spent our days
Chasing that silver lining hiding far away

I never wanted to change

Gave you all of me I'll never leave
Ways that we could stay between the sheets
Oh but they can't see what you do to me
Doesn't really matter what they say

And they think you don't give enough
But I do, I do
They say I don't really need your love
But I do, I do... I DO
And they think you don't give enough
But I do, I do
They say I don't really need your love
But I do, I do... I DO
End
