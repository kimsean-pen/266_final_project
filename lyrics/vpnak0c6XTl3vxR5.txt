Piece by piece
Piece by piece

And all I remember is your back
Walking towards the airport
Leaving us all in your past

I traveled fifteen hundred miles to see you
(Oh, oh, oh)
Begged you to want me
But you didn't want to
(Oh, oh, oh)
But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground, where you abandoned things and
Piece by piece he filled the holes that you burned in me
At six years old
And you know, he never walks away

He never asks for money
He takes care of me, he loves me
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay

(Piece by piece)

And all of your words fall flat
I made something of myself and now you want to come back
But your love, it isn't free
It has to be earned
(Oh, oh, oh)
Back then I didn't have anything you needed so I was worthless
(Oh, oh, oh)

But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground, where you abandoned things and
Piece by piece he filled the holes that you burned in me

At six years old
And you know, he never walks away
He never asks for money

He takes care of me, cause he loves me
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Piece by piece

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Piece by piece I fell far from the tree
I will never leave her like you left me
And she will never have to wonder her worth
Because unlike you I'm going to put her first
And you know
He'll never walk away
He'll never break her heart
He'll take care of things, he'll love her
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father should be great
(Piece by piece)
