Is anybody listening?
Can they hear me when I call?
I'm shooting signals in the air
Cuz I need somebody's help
I can't make it on my own
So I'm giving up myself
Is anybody listening, listening?

I've been stranded here and I'm miles away
Making signals hoping they save me
I lock myself inside these walls
Cuz out there I'm always wrong
I don't think I'm gonna make it
So while I'm sitting here on the eve of my defeat
I write this letter and hope it saves me

Is anybody listening?
Can they hear me when I call?
Shooting signals in the air
Cuz I need somebody's help
I can't make it on my own
So I'm giving up myself
Is anybody listening, listening?

I'm stuck in my own head and I'm oceans away
Would anybody notice if I chose to stay?
I'll send an S.O.S. tonight
And wonder if I will survive
How in the hell did I get so far away this time?
So now I'm sitting here
The time of my departure's near
I say a prayer please, someone save me

Is anybody listening?
Can they hear me when I call?
Shooting signals in the air
Cuz I need somebody's help
I can't make it on my own
So I'm giving up myself
Is anybody listening, listening?

I'm lost here
I can't make it on my own
I don't wanna die alone
I'm so scared
Drowning now
Reaching out
Holding onto everything I know
Crying out
Dying now
Need some help

Is anybody listening?
Can they hear me when I call?
Shooting signals in the air
I need somebody's help
I can't make it on my own
I'm giving up myself
Is anybody listening?
