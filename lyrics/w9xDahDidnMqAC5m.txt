Don't you be a traffic light
Don't you be a traffic light
With all things said you turn to red
Don't you be a traffic light

And don't you be a round-about
No, not another round-about
We've come so far, yet, back to the start
Don't you be a round-about

Oh, now, baby
Don't misread the signs
If you turn the key
Then things will turn out fine

Let's not have a break down
No, not another breakdown
You're on your own, a long way from home
Let's not have a breakdown

Don't misread the signs
If you just turn the key
Then things will turn out fine

Pushing me, you're breaking
Overtaking me, you're racing
Pushing me, you're breaking
(First placing me)
Overtaking me, you're racing
(Not chasing me back home)

Pushing me, you're breaking
Overtaking me, you're racing
Pushing me, you're breaking
(First placing me)
Overtaking me, you're racing
(Not chasing me back home)

We've come so far, yet, back to the start
(Pushing me, you're breaking, overtaking me, you're racing)
Don't you be a traffic light
(First placing me, not chasing me back home)

With all things said you turn to red
(Pushing me, you're breaking, overtaking me, you're racing)
Don't you be a traffic light
(First placing me, not chasing me back home)

Pushing me, you're breaking
Overtaking me, you're racing
First placing me not chasing
First placing me not chasing me back home now
Don't let me down
