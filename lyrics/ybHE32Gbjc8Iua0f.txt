Alicia Keys - The Life
Everyday I realize that this might be the last day of my life
Walking down the street I find that
I'm coming closer and closer to losing my mind
'Cause when it rains, it pours
Isn't life worth more?
I don't even know what I'm hustlin' for
You've gotta do what you gotta do just to make it through
All the hard times that's going to face you

This is the life, striving to survive
This is the life, striving to survive

Living will always be a struggle looking for someone true to love you
Looking back i see all the horrors, this madness makes me want to hide
I walk slowly, internally, I'm dying
Pillow case is wet from all my crying
There is nothing more to be here for
Take me away, I can't live this life no more

This is the life, striving to survive
This is the life, striving to survive

This is the life, striving to survive
This is the life, Striving to survive

La La La La La La La...

(Musical Break)

This is the life, striving to survive
This is the life, striving to survive

This is the life
