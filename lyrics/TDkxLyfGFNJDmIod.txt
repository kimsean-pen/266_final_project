Racin' all around without a head to roll
There's nothing keeping you from just floating away
Everything you thought you knew that was true
Has lost its connection and broken loose
A wound that has opened that can never heal
But you're floating on a channel that cancels the feel
Of being untethered in an open void
With nothing to grab you're just a broken toy

But you're free now
You don't need this
You won't freak out
You can't feel this

When sleepin' is a dream that you want to be given
But a waking sort of death is what you're actually livin'
You're caught inside a space with no way to leave
You're trapped inside a room with no air to breathe

I'll run a week, I'll run a full hundred miles
You cannot leave, you cannot demote yourself
Your words flaring out
Your words flaring out

But you're free now
You don't need this
You won't freak out
You can't feel this

'Cause you're free now
You don't need this
You won't freak out
You can't feel this

You did it right, you tried to forget it all
You did it right when you said it was all your fault
Don't change your mind, it's already over
Can't change your mind when it's already gone

But you're free now
You don't need this
You won't freak out
You can't feel this

'Cause you're free now
You don't need this
You won't freak out
You can't feel this
