A military regime in democratic disguise
that lies in all impunity
that takes apart what it took
people years to build
public institutions
that promised a decent life

self-determination should be a fact
not essentially a right

there are the lobbies
insurance companies
who want to change the whole country
into a vast commercial counter
for the pure consumer
the promise to give the generals a better place

self-determination should be fact
in the face of corruption
