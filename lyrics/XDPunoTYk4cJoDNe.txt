One lover, one human
Tell me what I have to do
My focus so fierce
The only way to see it through

One lover, one human
Everything I feel is true
So pure, so perfect
And I'm certain that it's you

I've been walking in my sleep
I've been talking in my dreams
Trying to stop
But it's impossible, it seems

Desire, desire
Desire, set fire
And burn us to the ground

Desire, desire
Desire, set fire
And burn us to the ground

You're high but you're here
Nowhere in the world to be
You're loud and you're clear
And you're coming through to me

You've been walking in my sleep
You've been talking in my dreams
Tryin' to stop
But it's impossible, it seems

Desire, desire
Desire, set fire
And burn us to the ground

Desire, desire
Desire, set fire
And burn us to the ground

(Desire) I've been walking in my sleep
(Desire) I've been talking in my dreams
(Desire) Trying to stop
But it's impossible, it seems

(Desire) I've been walking in my sleep
(Desire) I've been talking in my dreams
(Desire) Trying to stop
But it's impossible, it seems

(Desire) Such a beautiful life we're swimming in
(Desire) We lit the fire, we're shimmering
(Desire) Come with all your heart out to me, yeah
(Desire) We got a feeling just like we're giving it
(Desire) We lit the fire, we're shimmering
(Desire) So come with all your heart out to me

Desire, desire
Desire, set fire
And burn us to the ground
