My heart will beat, My heart will beat, My heart will beat

If you ever need me just tell me
And I'll be there
'cause I was build for you
Yes I was build to carry all your feelings
'cause I won't let them know
I won't let you go, baby
I don't care what your past is,
I don't need no answers
Just have faith in me

Don't you know you're a secret's safe with me?
My heart will beat, my heart will beat
All your worries can be put to can be put to sleep
My heart will beat
Don't you know you're a secret's safe with me?
My heart will beat, My heart will beat
All your worries can be put to can be put to sleep
My heart will beat

No need to step back,
Don't be scared
I got you you know that
I'm here, when you are sad
When all your clouds turn back
'cause I won't let them know
I won't let you go, baby

I don't care what your past is,
I don't need no answers
Just have faith in me

Don't you know you're a secret's safe with me?
My heart will beat, My heart will beat
All your worries can be put to can be put to sleep
My heart will beat
Don't you know you're a secret's safe with me?
My heart will beat, My heart will beat
All your worries can be put to can be put to sleep
My heart will beat
