Say, you must leave
From my mind you must flee
You must see
Go to hell you stupid prick
Breaking through a million times
Go to hell

My own self sense is loose
But that's alright
To be true overnight I'll end up
Overthinking until I die
Baby, do you know how sorry I am
My heart's a shy little guy
Maybe, I change my mind always too fast
Let's put the blame in the stars

Say, you must leave
From my mind you must flee
You must see
Go to hell you stupid prick
Let me jump into myself
Go to hell

Drinking tea every day
It just kills you slowly
Blowing bubbles of hate
Thinking what is love based on
You gotta be yourself
I feel like I've been here before
That's so wrong

You gotta be
Don't just fake it to me
Save you from yourself
You gotta stay confused

Say, you must leave
From my mind you must flee
You must see
Go to hell you stupid prick
You must leave, from my mind you must flee
Go to hell
