You can get it if you really want it
but you better off just leave it alone
you won't forget it if you ever had it
so you're better off just stayin' at home
She walked in with her alligator sister
tryin' to get to heaven on sunday
you'll never get it
if you never had it
so better off just leave it alone
And the dogs came in
just to see her smile
and the dogs came in
just to see her smile
just to see her smile
You don't get it, no, you won't forget it
so you're better off just leave it alone
if you don't stop thinkin'
soon you will be drinkin'
and you're better off just stayin' at home
She walked in with her alligator sister
tryin' to get to heaven on sunday
you'll never get it
if you never had it
so better off just leave it alone
And the dogs came in
just to see her smile
and the dogs came in
just to see her smile
just to see her smile
She walked in with her alligator sister
tryin' to get to heaven on sunday
you'll never get it
if you never had it
so better off just leave it alone
Coming down...
mom i'm still healing
coming down...
oh, i'm still breathing
coming down
You can get it if you really want it
but you better off just leave it alone
you won't forget it if you ever had it
so you're better off just stayin' at home
She walked in with her alligator sister
tryin' to get to heaven on sunday
you'll never get it
if you never had it
so better off just leave it alone...
