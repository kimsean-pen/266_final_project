Stop! Take it slowly, darling
This time I'm feeling a change.
Stop thinking too much about it
Love's gonna heal us again and again.
Sway! Just move with me darling.
And I'm going to move with you too.
Can't stop, now we can't miss, darling
On top â€“ such a beautiful view.
Stop! Take it slowly, darling
This time I'm feeling a change.
Stop thinking too much about it
Love's gonna heal us again and again.
(Again and again, again and again, again and again)
(Again and again, again and again, again and again)
(Again and again, again and again, again and again)
(Again and again, again and again, again and again)
(Again and again, again and again, again and again)
Sway! Just move with me darling.
Sway! Just move with me darling.
Sway! Just move with me darling.
Sway! Just move with me darling.
(Just move with me darling.)
(Just move with me darling
