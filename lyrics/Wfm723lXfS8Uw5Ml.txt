Hypocrites

Weeping rose of Jeremiah
Drops of blood drip off your petals
Representing all our tears
In a ring of burning metal

How you wanna be?
What you gonna say it?
It doesn't bother me
Who you gonna pay

Sorcerers and sadists come
To define the what and why
People travel 'cross this earth
Over water, land and sky

How you wanna be?
What you gonna say it?
It doesn't bother me
Who you gonna pay

Pay the ferryman, pay the fucking driver
Pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars
Pay the bitches they're charging all their dates, stand by
I'm not gonna pay, it's already mine

Hypocrites
I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites
I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites
I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites
Your messiah was never mine

Weeping rose of Jeremiah
Purity unlike no other
Offers hope to those who need it
Don't forget care to thy brother

How you wanna be?
What you gonna say it?
It doesn't bother me
Who you gonna pay

Little old lady at home
Writing out a check to send
It's all the money that she owns
She believes the world might end

How you wanna be?
What you gonna say it?
It doesn't bother me
Who you gonna pay

Pay the ferryman, pay the fucking driver
Pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars
Pay the bitches they're charging all their dates, stand by
I'm not gonna pay, it's already mine

Hypocrites
I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites
I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites
I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites
Your messiah was never mine
Hypocrites

Pay the ferryman, pay the fucking driver
Pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars
Pay the bitches they're charging all their dates, stand by
I'm not gonna pay, it's already mine

Hypocrites
