With your hand
You kept the real world outside
I hear you and you hear me
Through the songs
We can not be

I draw a way out of this mess
And it leads
Into a second world
A second world
A world where you are free

With your hand
You kept the real world outside
I hear you and you hear me
Through the songs
We can not be

I draw a way out of this mess
And it leads
Into a second world
A second world
A world where you are free
