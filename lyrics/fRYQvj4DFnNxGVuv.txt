Where are you?
Why do you hide?
Where is that moonlight trail that leads to your side?
Just like the moonraker goes
In search of his dream of gold
I search for love
For someone to have and hold

I've seen your smile
In a thousand dreams
Felt your touch
And it always seems
You loved me
You loved me

Where are you?
When will we meet?
Take my unfinished life and make it complete
Just like the moonraker knows
His dream will come true someday
I know that you
Are only a kiss away

I've seen your smile
In a thousand dreams
Felt your touch
And it always seems
You loved me
You loved me.
