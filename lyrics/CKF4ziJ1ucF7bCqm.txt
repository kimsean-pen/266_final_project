My cold, cold sailor heart
Says "Get on your way!"
I ain't too proud to say,
But that's how I'm made.

I'll be that person 'til my dyin' day.
I try so awful hard
But I can't change.

From runways to the road
I ramble alone.
This thumbnail size a' heart
Is black as coal.

Your beauty it still bring me
To my knees
Don't waste a tear on me,
It's my disease.

Chorus:

Don't leave no smell on me
Don't leave no smell on me
I'll blow off in your sleep
Don't leave no smell on me

Those preppy boys in blue,
They're makin' fun of us
So we take it to the street
'Cause we're an ornery cuss

But we're not here to make your children bleed
We're here to come around with the tumbleweed

Chorus
(Now guitar, go get her!)

Don't take these boots off me
When you're thinkin' I'm dead.
I'll still be runnin' from
The demons in my head.

I'll be that person 'til my dyin' day.
I try so awful hard
But I can't change.

Chorus
(Don't leave now, go get her!)
