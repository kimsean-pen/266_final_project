Everybody knows
Everybody knows
That you cradle the sun
Living in remorse, sky is over

Don't you want to hold me, baby?
Disappointed, going crazy

Even though we can't afford
The sky is over
Even though we can't afford
The sky is over

I don't wanna see you go
The sky is over
Even though we can't afford
The sky is over

Behind closed eyes lie
The mind's ready to awaken you
Are you at war with land
And all of its creatures?

You're not so gentle
Persuasion has been known
To wreck economies of countries, of empires
The sky is over

Don't you want to hold me, baby?
Disappointed, going crazy

Even though we can't afford
The sky is over
Even though we can't afford
The sky is over

I don't wanna see you go
The sky is over
Even though we can't afford
The sky is over

I don't wanna see you go
The sky is over
Even though we can't afford
The sky is over

I don't wanna see you go
The sky is over
Even though we can't afford
The sky is over, sky is over us
