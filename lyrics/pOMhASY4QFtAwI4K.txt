Forreal, forreal, forreal, yeah
Sleep on em that's Tempurpedic
Get the green like it's count
Pockets they fat just like Kenan
Told her I love her ain't mean it
That's because I hit the meanest
You heard that I am from Mars
I heard that you was from Venus
I met that bitch in a meeting
I fucked that bitch from the meeting
I just was planning to leave her
So I just left it to Jesus, yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh
Lil Vert like Gerald
Took that girl to Jared
Fucking that girl 'til she tear up
Heard you fucked her she embarrassed
Heard your whip carry your belt,wait
Forreal, forreal, forreal?
Diamonds they wet like a seal
Diamonds wet like Navy Seal
Heard you drink lean, crack the seal
Everybody know it ain't real

You know I'm cappin' forreal
Walk around with it forreal
You wanna bet that my money, forreal
Forreal, forreal?
All of my diamonds forreal, different color like Pharrell's
Yeah that's forreal, forreal, forreal
You know I'm cappin' forreal
Walk around with it forreal
You wanna bet that my money, forreal
Forreal, forreal?
All of my diamonds forreal, different color like Pharrell's
Yeah that's forreal, forreal, forreal

Won't say no names but my niggas they pulled up
You niggas talk too much, get your mouth sewed up
Look at my chain, know it's ice cause it's snowing
Vivienne West but my friend looking polo
My Gosha from Dover I drive in the Rover
Homie don't know me don't get in my moment
All that sneak dissing don't think that I ain't noticed
I left my door and I forgot to close it
Boy better keep it sealed
Fuck around, get killed
Fuck around, get drilled
Cut your hands if you steal
Whip it up like a meal
I just made me a mill'
Money jumping out my pockets
Tucking bands in my belt
Stop calling my phone
Leave me alone
I'm on TV, with the VVS, so I 3-D my stones
Really don't get along
She ain't even got more chill
Had to keep this shit for real
All the way to the beat build

You know I'm cappin' forreal
Walk around with it forreal
You wanna bet that my money, forreal
Forreal, forreal?
All of my diamonds forreal, different color like Pharrell's
Yeah that's forreal, forreal, forreal
You know I'm cappin' forreal
Walk around with it forreal
You wanna bet that my money, forreal
Forreal, forreal?
All of my diamonds forreal, different color like Pharrell's
Yeah that's forreal, forreal, forreal
