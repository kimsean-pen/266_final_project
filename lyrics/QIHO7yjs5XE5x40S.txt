I see your face before my eyes
I'm falling into darkness
Why must I fight to stay alive?
Heroes falling

Wake me, can't you hear me calling? (Calling, calling, calling...)
Out of darkness, they come crawling

Here I am
I am lost in your land
And I hope you will be
Creeping in my soul
Shadows fall, let me out
Hear my call
And I'll always believe
Creeping in my soul

(Creeps from the deep's gonna be freaking up your mind)
(Creeps from the deep's gonna be feeding off your spine)

I fade away into the night
My eyes are closing in
Shadows are fleeing from the light
My nightmares can begin

Wake me, can't you hear me calling? (Calling, calling, calling...)
Out of darkness, they come crawling

Here I am
I am lost in your land
And I hope you will be
Creeping in my soul
Shadows fall, let me out
Hear my call
And I'll always believe
Creeping in my soul

(Creeping in my soul, it's getting out of control)
(I got to find my escape and get out of this black hole
('Cause justice in the world is hard to find)
(Time has come, got to make up my mind)
(No matter how deep or remote I hide)
(All my thoughts seem caught up inside)
(Creeps from the deep's gonna be freaking up your mind)
(Creeps from the deep's gonna be feeding off your spine) (Spine, spine, spine...)

Here I am
I am lost in your land
And I hope you will be
Creeping in my soul
Shadows fall, let me out
Hear my call
And I'll always believe
Creeping in my soul
Here I am
I am lost in your land (Here I am)
And I hope you will be
Creeping in my soul (I'm lost)
Shadows fall, let me out
Hear my call (I'm lost)
And I'll always believe
Creeping in my soul (Soul, soul, soul...)
