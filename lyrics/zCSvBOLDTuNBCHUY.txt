Hey there, Father, I don't wanna bother you
but I've got a sin to confess
I'm just sixteen, if you know what I mean
do you mind if I take off my dress?
Don't know where to start, let me get to the good parts
Might wanna cross up your legs

I've got envy, I've got greed, anything that you need
And I'm not above having to beg
There was this boy who
Tore my heart in two

I had to lay him
Eight feet underground
All I need is someone to save me
'Cause I am goin' down
And what I need is someone to save me

'Cause I am goin' down
All the way down
Well hey there, Father, there is just one other thing
I have a simple request
I hear you know God, could you give him a nod in my direction
I would be in your debt
Perhaps there is something that we could work out

I notice your breathing is starting to change
We could go in the back, behind all these stacks
of these bibles and get out of this cage
There was this boy who

Tore my heart in two
I had to lay him
Eight feet underground
And all I need is someone to save me
'Cause I am goin' down

And what I need is someone to save me
'Cause God, I'm goin' down
All the way down
I didn't wanna do it Father
But I caught him with another woman
In the bed I made

And so I put him in a grave
And now there's no one left around
To get me off when I wanted to drag
The next day on the television
They identified him by the circumcision

That I made and now I'm on the run but wait
Why did I have to go and kill him
When he was the best I ever had?
All I need is someone to save me
'Cause I am goin' down
And what I need is something to save me
'Cause God, I'm goin' down
All the way down
I'm going down
All the way down
