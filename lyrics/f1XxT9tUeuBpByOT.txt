Oohhh, yeah, oooh huh
I woke up this morning with a smile on my face
And nobody's gonna bring me down today
Been feeling like nothing's been going my way lately
But I decided right here, right now, that my outlooks gonna change
That's why I'm gonna
Say goodbye to all the tears I've cried
Everytime somebody hurt my pride
Feelin' like they won't let me live life
And take the time to look at what is mine

I see every blessing so clearly
And I thank god for what I got from above

I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace from me
They can say all they wanna say about me, but I'm
I'm gonna carry on (carry on)
I'mma keep on (keep on) singin' my song

I never wanna dwell on the pain again
There's no use in relivin' how I hurt back then
Rememberin' too well the hell I felt when I was runnin' out of faith
Every step I'm 'bout to take well it's towards a better day
'Cause I'm about to
Say farewell to every single lie

And all the fears I've held too long inside
Everytime I felt I couldn't try
All the negativity and strife
'Cause too long I've been strugglin', couldn't go on
But now I've found I'm feelin' strong and I'm moving on

I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace from me

They can say all they wanna say about me, but I'm
I'm gonna carry on (carry on)
I'mma keep on (keep on) singin' my song
Everytime I tried to be what they wanted from me
It never came naturally, so I ended up in misery

Was unable to see all the good around me
Wasting so much energy on what they thought of me
Than simply just rememberin' to breathe, I've learned
I'm humanly unable to please everyone at the same time
So now I find my peace of mind living one day at a time
In the end I answer to one god
Comes down to one love

Till I get to heaven above
I have made the decision

Never to give in
Till the day I die no matter what
I'm gonna carry on, I'mma keep on singin' my song...
(They can't take anything from me)
I believe that they can do what they wanna
Say what they wanna say
(They can say what they wanna)
But I'm gonna keep on(Keep on)
I believe it
That they can take from me
But they can't take my inner peace
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say what you wanan say, I am gonna sing my song
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
