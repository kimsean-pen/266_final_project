Put your hand in a parting wave
Pass around
Make a shroud pulling combs through a backwash frame
Find the copies in a carbon mount
Pass around
Stroke a pocket with a print of a laughing sound

Get around town
Get around town
Where the people look good
Where the music is loud
Get around town
No need to stand proud

Add your voice to the sound of the crowd
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Ohhh...

The shades from a pencil peer
Pass around
A fold in an eyelid brushed with fear

The lines on a compact guide
Pass around
A hat with alignment worn insde

Get in line now
Get in line now
Stay in time with the rhythm and rhyme

Get around town
Get around town
Where the people look good
Where the music is loud
Get around town
No need to stand proud
Add your voice to the sound of the crowd
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Ohhh...

Get in line now

Get in line now
Stay in time with the rhythm and rhyme
Get around town
Get around town
Where the people look good
Where the music is loud
Get around town

No need to stand proud
Add your voice to the sound of the crowd

Get in line now
Get in line now
Stay in time with the rhythm and rhyme
Get around town
Get around town
Where the people look good
Where the music is loud
Get around town
No need to stand proud
Add your voice to the sound of the crowd
