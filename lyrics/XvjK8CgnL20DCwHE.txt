Take me back to the music room
Where we used to play
With the brides in bloom
And our laughter was
Just like a horse to groom
We've been making magic
With our hands of doom

Come, Luisa!
We'll take you higher!
We'll take you higher
Be-a-married-to-a merman!

Comb my hair
Let my beauty beam
So the deviant stares
Won't be just for the gleam

As the sudden traces lead to the shore
Pretty faces turn into foam
The mermen aren't
What they were before

Come, Luisa!
We'll take you higher!
We'll take you higher
Be-a-married-to-a merman!

We will see, we will see
Mermen don't exist really
We just place our perfect dreams
In the shell of someone real

Merman!
