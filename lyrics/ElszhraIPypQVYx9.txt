I was just barely holding on trying to keep on
I saw no signs of anyone, box built around the sun
I thought to sleep the day away but dreams were as dark as the night's way
How did you hear the drop of my tear you just saw the fear

You were there for the waking, my soul was sleeping
You woke me shaking every piece of me
You took me under, eyes wide to you with wonder
Built me a heart strong, carry me on

We find light down every road we take, feet never seem to break
Unable to feel unstable and you carry me all the way (all the way)
I see comfort in your ways, keeping me safe for the days
oh oh, oh oh
Your presence gives me joy alone, never do I face the world alone (alone)

You were there for the waking, my soul was sleeping
You woke me shaking every piece of me
You took me under, eyes wide to you with wonder
Built me a heart strong, carry me on
on and on Put away the days,
when? was what I chased,
when love had no space to live
This world we built,
is long passed failed
my hands cannot hold on to a shield
my hands cannot hold on to a shield, shield
my hands cannot hold on to a shield, shield
opened up what I had sealed, sealed
opened up what I had sealed, sealed

You were there for the waking, my soul was sleeping
You woke me shaking every piece of me
You took me under, eyes wide to you with wonder
Built me a heart strong, carry me on
on and on
