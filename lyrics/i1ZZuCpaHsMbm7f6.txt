A silent tear
An empty smile,
So insincerely, but so gently in denial
And me the thief
So selfishly
All the moments meant for you, I made them mine

How was I, so blind to miss you, crumbling inside?
Is it too late now to fix you? Let me make it right!
'Cause there'll be no sun on Sunday
No reason for words to rhyme
'Cause if you're bleeding, so am I

A wishful look
A hesitate,
You're hoping I will notice that you're not OK
And me a fool
You turn away
It's only then I feel the weight of my mistakes

How was I, so blind to miss you, crumbling inside?
Is it too late now to fix you? Let me make it right
'Cause there'll be no sun on Sunday
No reason for words to rhyme
'Cause if you're bleeding, so am I

And if I cut you
If I bruise you
Then the scars are always mine
'Cause I love you
So to lose you
Would be worse than if I died

How was I, so blind to miss you, crumbling inside?
Is it too late now to fix you? Let me make it right
'Cause there'll be no sun on Sunday
No reason for words to rhyme
'Cause if you're bleeding, so am I
