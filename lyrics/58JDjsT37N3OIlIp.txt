I'm tearing up, across your face
move dust through the light
to find your name
it's something faint
this is not a place
not yet awake, I'm raised to make

Still alive for you, love
still alive for you, love
still alive for you, love

In a matter of a month
from forests, for the soft
gotta know been lead aloft
so rid of all your stories
what I know, what it is, is boring
wire it up!
Now breaking new ground
