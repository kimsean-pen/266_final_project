Swingin' on the front porch
Swingin' on the lawn
Swingin' where we want
'Cause there ain't nobody home
Swingin' to the left
Swingin' to the right
I'm thinkin' about baseball
I'll swing all night, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Swingin' in the living room
Swingin' in the kitchen
Most folks don't 'cause
They're too busy bitchin'
Swingin' in there 'cause
She wanted me to feed her
I mixed up the batter
And she licked the beater

I scream, you scream
We all scream for her
Don't even try 'cause
You can't ignore her

She's my cherry pie
Cool drink of water
Such a sweet surprise
Tastes so good
Make a grown man cry
Sweet cherry pie, oh yeah

She's my cherry pie
Put a smile on your face
Ten miles wide
Looks so good
Bring a tear to your eye
Sweet cherry pie

Swingin' to the drums
Swingin' to guitar
Swingin' with the bass
In the back of my car
Ain't got money
And I got no gas
But we'll get where we're goin'
If we swing real fast

I scream, you scream
We all scream for her
Well, don't even try 'cause
You can't ignore her

She's my cherry pie
Cool drink of water
Such a sweet surprise
Tastes so good
Make a grown man cry
Sweet cherry pie, oh yeah

She's my cherry pie
Put a smile on your face
Ten miles wide
Looks so good
Bring a tear to your eye

Sweet cherry pie
Hi, hi, yeah, hi-hi, yeah
Swing it! All night long
Oh yeah baby

(On the table, bathroom)
Swingin' on the bathroom
Swingin' on the floor
So motherf-kin' hard
We forgot to lock the door
In walk her daddy
Standin' six foot four
Ain't gonna swing with my daughter no more

She's my cherry pie
Cool drink of water
Such a sweet surprise
Tastes so good
Make a grown man cry
Sweet cherry pie, oh yeah

She's my cherry pie
Put a smile on your face
Ten miles wide
Looks so good
Bring a tear to your eye
Sweet cherry pie
Sweet cherry pie
Oh yeah, baby
Swing it!
