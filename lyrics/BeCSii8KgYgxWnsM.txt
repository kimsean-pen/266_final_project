Remember!
Remember!
Remember!

For the blood
For the sweat
For the fears and the things that betray us
For the cracks in the mirrors
And the ones that you bust on the pavement

We're awake in this dream
And we choose to believe
That the you that's in me is in everything
We're alive, we're alive...

It's who we are that keeps me believing
There's something here bigger than ourselves
If I'm wrong, then why am I still feeling
Who we are keeps me believing?

For the pain
For the strength
For our will to hold on to the changes
From the now to the end
Every second we count
We embrace it

As our faces erase
And our bodies decay
As you move through the waves
That echo our names
We're alive, we're alive...

It's who we are that keeps me believing
There's something here bigger than ourselves
If I'm wrong, then why am I still feeling
Who we are keeps me believing?

Keeps me believing

One more time
We stand together
Never forget why
Always remember

One more time
We stand together
Always remember!

It's who we are that will be making it out alive
After all, it's down here we die

It's who we are that keeps me believing
There's something here bigger than ourselves
If I'm wrong, then why am I still feeling
Who we are keeps me believing?

Keeps me believing
It keeps me believing

(Woah-oh-ah-ohhhh)

Who we are keeps me believing

Keeps me believing
Keeps me believing
Keeps me believing
