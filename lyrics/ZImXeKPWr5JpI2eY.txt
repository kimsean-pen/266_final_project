It's not so long ago, that the sound hit the nation
Every Saturday night, on your favorite radio
The party's jumpin' yeah, and the vibe feels so strong
Throw your hands in the air, lift your head up high
You know you've got to sing along

Don't you know, pump it up

Got to feel it, what's the name of the jam
Say I can feel it, you know you can
I've got my groove on, and I'm ready to go
Check out my ride girl, but don't touch my radio

Don't you know, pump it up
You've got to pump it up

And make me feel good, feel so good
And make me feel good, feel so good
