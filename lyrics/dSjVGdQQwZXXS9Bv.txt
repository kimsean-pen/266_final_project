Sitting alone in my room
Thinking about what imma do
Music don't pay the bills
Music don't pay for food

Hommies sell hella drugs
Only cause they have to
And that sucks
They got the cars and I ride the bus
Unless I'm on a board, wheels and trucks.

I got the west coast blues
I got the West coast blues
I got the west coast blues
I got the west coast blues

Oh no, she's sniffing at coke
Hit the dream, I'd rather do Molly
Mushrooms are road trips snacks
Won't live life unless is fast
pull up, now she's drinking my bottle
my guess? she's probably a model
I don't know how to act
so I grabbed her by the ass

I got the west coast blues
I got the west coast blues
I got the west coast blues
I got the west coast blues

I got the west coast blues
I got the west coast blues
I got the west coast blues
I got the west coast blues
