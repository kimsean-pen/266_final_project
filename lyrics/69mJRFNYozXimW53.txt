I was looking for a breath of life
For a little touch of heavenly light
But all the choirs in my head say, no

To get a dream of life again
A little vision of the start at the end
But all the choirs in my head say, no

But I needed one more touch
Another taste of heavenly rush
And I believe, I believe it so

And I needed one more touch
Another taste of divine rush
And I believe, I believe it so

Whose side am I on? Whose side am I?
Whose side am I on? Whose side am I?

And the fever began to spread
From my heart down to my legs
But the room is so quiet

And although I wasn't losing my mind
It was a chorus so sublime
But the room is too quiet

I was looking for a breath of life
A little touch of heavenly light
But all the choirs in my head say, no

To get a dream of life again
A little vision of the start at the end
But all the choirs in my head say, no

It's a harder way and it's come to claim her
And I always say, we should be together
I can't sleep alone, because there's something in here
And if you are gone, I will not belong here (belong, belong, belong)

And I started to hear it again
But this time it wasn't the end
And the room is so quiet

And my heart is a hollow plain
For the devil to dance again
But the room is too quiet

I was looking for a breath of a life
A little touch of heavenly light
But all the choirs in my head sang, no
