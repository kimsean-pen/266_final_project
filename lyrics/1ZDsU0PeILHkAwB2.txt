Let this battle commence, one last time
Let this battle commence, one last time
Let this battle commence, one last time
(And I hope for your sake, that you're on our side)
Let this battle commence, one last time
(And I hope for your sake, that you're on our side)
Look what you've done to yourself
Yeah you've lost the will to do what's right again
Look what you've done to yourself
We'll fight like sharks, we'll fight like dogs
(We were shy...)
Look what you've done to yourself
Yeah you've lost the will to do what's right again
Look what you've done to yourself
Yeah
We try to communicate
We've got no patience
Let's reclaim this throne
Why should we negotiate
Let's finish this now
Let's settle this now
For once and for all
Let's settle this now
For once and for all
Let this battle commence, one last time
(And I hope for your sake, that you're on our side)
Let this battle commence, one last time! Woah!
(And I hope for your sake, that you're on our side)
Look what you've done to yourself
Yeah you've lost the will to do what's right again
Look what you've done to yourself
We'll fight like sharks, we'll fight like dogs
(We were shy)
Look what you've done to yourself
Yeah you've lost the will to do what's right again
Look what you've done to yourself
We'll fight like sharks, we'll fight like dogs
(We were shy)
The time has come to think again...
To think again...
Look what you've done to yourself...
OK, TIME FOR PLAN B.
THIS MEANS WAR!
THIS MEANS WAR!
THIS MEANS WAR!
THIS MEANS WAR!
Everyone freezes and waits for the earth to move
Everyone freezes and waits for the ground to shake
LETS MAKE THE EARTH MOVE
LETS MAKE THE GROUND SHAKE
LETS MAKE THE EARTH MOVE
LETS MAKE THE GROUND SHAKE
LETS MAKE THE EARTH MOVE
LETS MAKE THE GROUND SHAKE
LETS MAKE THE EARTH MOVE
LETS MAKE THE GROUND SHAKE!
