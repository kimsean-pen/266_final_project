Tryna solve my problems off this fifth of Henny
How many fucks to give, lately, I'm running empty
Struggle with who I am and who I wanna be
Got the streets and these beats right in front of me
Should I kill this nigga or should I let him slide?
If I don't, he double back, we got family ties?
If I do, I can't rap, that's suicide
These niggas telling, turn you to felons, twenty-five
I can't have my babies walking around in projects
While I'm on my bunk stressing through the process
I'd rather be a prospect, you know, god-like
But for now, many texts, this is my life
Should I kill this nigga or should I let him bye?
My momma say I'm like my daddy, I got too much pride
And she was right, mix this bottle with the lime and sprite
Hit the lights, yeah, somebody gotta die tonight

Is it worth it
Maybe, when you go home
I don't wanna be here

They say money's the root of all evil
I say, they power of pussy'll scar people
That pretty flower'll spoil you, then it'll poison you
You get amnesia to everything you was loyal to
I wanna fuck this little bitch, but I know she bogus
Credit cards, profiles, bank's always open
And if I smash, do the dash, that's hocus pocus
She 'bout cash, I ain't mad, I'm just not devoted
To fall in love with, doing exotic drugs and playing inside of clubs
I'm never the one to cuff
She like, 'Johnny, you know this pussy yours and only yours
Take the rubber off and smoke passion, you could explore
Is it worth it
If you see me on TV telling the girls about me
And all she saw was a Benz and thought the world about me
She think her nigga a lick and I got rapper money
And child support is the legal way she can ask for money

Is it worth it
Maybe, when you go home
I don't wanna be here
