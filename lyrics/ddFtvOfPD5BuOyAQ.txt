I
Remember all the cries
It's a secret dream
I'm lost in your love

You
Your lonesome eyes are all I wanna know
Helpless tears
Can never stop the rain

Only you can turn my life
Can turn it just this way

Touch in the night
It feels like heaven
Touch in the night
So lucky in love

Lost in your light
Another secret
Touch in the night
Whatever I do

You
My angel in disguise
Deep inside my heart
Like the inner light

I
Believe in all your promise and your lies
But I feel
In the end I'll lose

Only you can turn my life
Can turn it just this way

Tonight I feel, I feel for you
Tonight I call, I'm calling your name
Tonight I feel, I feel for you - tonight

Touch in the night
It feels like heaven
Touch in the night
So lucky in love

Tonight I feel, I feel for you
Tonight I call, I'm calling your name
Tonight I feel, I feel for you - tonight

Only you can turn my life
Can turn it just this way

Touch in the night
It feels like heaven
Touch in the night
So lucky in love

Tonight I feel, I feel for you
Touch in the night
Tonight I call, I'm calling your name
Touch in the night

Tonight I feel, I feel for you
Touch in the night
Tonight I call, I'm calling your name
Touch in the night

Tonight I feel, I feel for you
Touch in the night
Tonight
