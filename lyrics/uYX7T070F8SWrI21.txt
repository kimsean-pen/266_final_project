Gone, gone like you've never been
Now I'm gone in the sky, in the ways of the wind
No it's nothing that I ever hold
But it keeps me going on

Pass by saw your face in the clouds
Took a heart shaped stone to lift my heart from the ground
No it's nothing that I ever know
But it keeps me holding on

Give me just a sign
Heaven make it mine
God I want to find
Give me just a sign

I was alone, I was ready to fall
Found a bluebird's feather heard a bluebird call
Maybe nothing but a radio song
But it keeps me going on

And I don't know if I ever find
But I keep on looking 'til the end of all times
You'll be here 'til the signs are gone
And they keep me holding on

Give me just a sign
Heaven make it mine
God I want to find
Give me just a sign

Give me just a sign
Heaven make it mine
God I want to find
Give me just a sign

La ah ah, ah ah ah
La la, la la, la la
La la la, ah ah ah

Give me just a sign
Heaven make it mine
God I want to find
Give me just a sign

Give me just a sign
Heaven make it mine
God I want to find
Give me just a sign
