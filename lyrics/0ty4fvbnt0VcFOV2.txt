No, no, never say
Never say, never say goodbye
No, no, no

I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, I
I never can say goodbye

Everytime I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right to the core

It says, turn around, you fool
You know you love him
More and more

Tell me why
(Tell me why) is it so
Don't wanna let you go

No, I never can say goodbye, boy
Ooh, no, no
I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Hey, I never can say goodbye, boy
Ooh, baby, I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, I
I never can say goodbye
(Never say goodbye, boy)

I keep thinking that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
There's that anguish
There's that doubt

It's that same old dizzy hang up
I can't get by without you

Tell me why
(Tell me why) is it so
Don't wanna let you go

I never can say goodbye, boy
Ooh, no, no
I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Hey, I never can say goodbye, boy
Ooh, baby, I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Never say goodbye, boy)

(Never say goodbye, boy)
Everytime I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door

There's that same old dizzy feeling
Piercing me right to the core

It says, turn around, you fool
You know you love him
More and more
Tell me why
(Tell me why) is it so
Don't wanna let you go
No, no, let you go
No, no, let you go, go, go, let you go
No, no, no, baby
Hey, I never can say goodbye, boy
Ooh, no baby, I never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Hey, I never can say goodbye, boy
Say goodbye, boy
Say goodbye, boy
No, I never can say goodbye, boy
No, no, no, no, no...
