It's getting late
Time is counting down
Now with the memories
I think of what I live without
No amount of candlelight
There is not a song to play
No words can heal the heart
When the heart has been slain

But there's nothing to say
Oh when there's nothing to say, hey, oh

Doesn't matter where you started
Every good man will fall
No matter the flag that's raised
Or the place that you call your home
I feel the storm is brewing
A fever pounding in the ground
And the waves will keep on crashing
When all you want is out, yea

(Everybody's talking but they don't know, don't know)
Ooh, but there's nothing to say

(Everybody's talking, everybody's talk)
Oh, when there's nothing to say, hey, oh

(Everybody's talking but they don't know, don't know)
(Everybody's talking, everybody's talk)

Oh, when there's nothing to say
When there's nothing to say
Ooh, and there's no looking ahead if you stay the same

(Everybody's talking but they don't
know, but they don't know, don't know)
Oh, if you stay the same

(Everybody's talking but they don't know, don't know)
Ooh
(Everybody's talking, everybody's talk)
Ooh

(Everybody's talking but they don't know, don't know)
No, they don't know
(Everybody's talking, everybody's talk)

Oh, but there's nothing to say
(Everybody's talking but they don't know, don't know)
Oh, when there's nothing to say, ooh

(Everybody's talking, everybody's talk)
No, there is nothing to say, hey, oh

(Everybody's talking but they don't know, don't know)
Everybody's talking, everybody's talk
Everybody's talking, everybody's talk
Everybody's talk
