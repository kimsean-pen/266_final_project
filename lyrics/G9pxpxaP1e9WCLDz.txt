I have paced these forests for so long i don't know if i am man or i am beast.
i, though, hold deep within me a quest for revenge.
then i must be a man as much as i can be.
I have learned to speak the tongue of the animal
i have learned to read the signs in bark and snow.
i have taken within myself the spirits of my fathers,
long time gone.
in this short time, far from home, a man of iron i've grown.
a man of iron i have grown.
