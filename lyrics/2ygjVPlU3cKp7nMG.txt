Who really knows what rights all the wrongs anyway
Who really cares what people do or say
And no matter where this life takes me
I'll never let it compromise
Too much luck to bet it on do or die

'Cause I've seen everything that I could see
And now I can say goodbye today
With all I know, it's time I said goodbye
Today is a Good Day To Die

Lived by the rules that you gave me and fell apart
All the wrong turns down a dead end street so far
I stretched my wings and breathe in a different day
Alone and broke is the price I pay
But that's okay

I've seen everything that I could see
And now I can say goodbye today
With all I know, it is time I said goodbye
Today is a Good Day To Die

Never thought in my life
Taking all I can take
It's time to say goodbye
It's a Good Day To Die

'Cause I've seen everything that I could see
And now I can say goodbye today
With all I know, it's time I said goodbye
Today is a Good Day To Die
'Cause I've seen everything
And I know all I know
It's time I said goodbye today
With all I know, it's time I said goodbye
Today is a Good Day To Die
