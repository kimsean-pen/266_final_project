I don't know why I hit the ground
Even though I held you down
I don't know if you'll ever change
Why and how come you didn't?

Don't you need me
Don't you see me
Through mothers eyes?

Cause I belong to you
No matter what we do
I belong to you
And blood bounds for life
And history too

Don't you give up all your life
Just because my actions did not satisfy
Don't you blame me for your desires
No, I'm sorry but I can't rewind

Don't you need me
Don't you see me
Through mothers eyes?

Cause I belong to you
No matter what we do
I belong to you
And blood bounds for life
And history too

Cause I belong to you
No matter what we do
I belong to you
And blood bounds for life
And history too

I don't know why I hit the ground
I hit the ground
