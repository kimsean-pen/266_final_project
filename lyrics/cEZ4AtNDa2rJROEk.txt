I walk home with snow falling
Deep on, frozen loneliness
And I'll leave all those celebrating
All the things that they have done

I'll come over to your office
And watch 'em come and go
Though I know
I won't see you there

Now take a train down to the coast
And sit and watch a scene
I'll be sitting there
Alone

And as usual above all things
I miss you every day
Without pause

Happy new year my darling
Happy new year

I walk home with snow falling
Deep on, frozen loneliness
And I'll leave all those celebrating
All the things that they have done

Happy new year my darling
Happy new year
