Lights out
Everybody
It
Is
Later
Than
You
Think

Ooga fucking booga, bitch
Hiding in your fucking trunk
I'm dirty right down to the bone
Ooga fucking booga, bitch
Riding in that fucking donk
Scheming my way to the back of your brain and I'm coming up with that future funk

Sliding to get an OT
Sitting up high like I'm on blue dream
Got the 's in the trunk and they shake the street
Ghoste up in black and my soul don't freeze
Putting motherfuckers underwater ever since I dropped my verse to LeaveMeInTheSky
So I called up the Reaper and asked him why I'm still alive
Never give a fuck about a motherfucker trying to bring a motherucker down to they level
Settle
For the shit [?] for me to make it to the next level
So I see you wanna act like [?] kicking it in my rap scene
And if I wake up in the morning with a scratch on me I'ma remain closed and deceased
When you see me better jump

Ooga fucking booga, bitch
Hiding in your fucking trunk
I'm dirty right down to the bone
Ooga fucking booga, bitch
Riding in that fucking donk
Scheming my way to the back of your brain and I'm coming up with that future funk
