Waiting for absolution
Guiltless in custody
So many years I've been condemned for what I've done
They have added many lies
I was fighting to defend the ones I love
Now they strain and turn the truth

Crucify me
Crucify me
Crucify me
I don't care

Restless in a cage of madness
Justice, my time will come
So far, no further, I am waisting too much time
My words are falling on deaf ears
And now I'm ready to release the beast in me
So come and catch me if you can

Crucify me
Crucify me
Crucify me
I don't care

Crucify me (waiting for absolution)
Crucify me (remains in custody)
Crucify me (so many lies)
Crucify me (Crucify me)

So many years I've been condemned for what I've done
They have added many lies
And now I'm ready to release the beast in me
So come and catch me if you can

Crucify me
Crucify me
Crucify me
I don't care

Crucify me
Crucify me
Crucify me
I don't care
