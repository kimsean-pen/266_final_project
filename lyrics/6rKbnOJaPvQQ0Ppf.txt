Full sails ahead, oceans painted red
When the soldiers of fortune hunt for pirates
No questions asked, we fulfil our task
Tones all turn grey after sunset

Slaying a man, taking what you can
What is right, what is wrong, who can answer?
Sailing the seas, we do just what we please
Emperors, pirates; all cancer

Hoist the sails!? Wipe them out now
Kill them all!? Let them die
Scum they are!? Foe of mankind
Clear the sea!? Show no ruth

We have no choice, it's you who are the bad guys
You've taken it all and yet you still dare to fault
Who are you to judge and condemn us
Underneath the paint your flag is still black

Hoist the sails!? Wipe them out now
Kill them all!? Let them die
Scum they are!? Foe of mankind
Clear the sea!? Show no ruth

Yes we can, and therefore we do so
Please understand, that there's nothing you can do
The world has changed, your justice is outdated
What is right, is what is right to me

Full sails ahead, oceans painted red
When the soldiers of fortune hunt for pirates
No questions asked, we fulfil our task
Tones all turn grey after sunset

Slaying a man, taking what you can
What is right, what is wrong, who can answer?
Sailing the seas, we do just what we please
Emperors, pirates; all cancer

Share the wealth, your holdings should be ours
It's all a smile on our sunny bright kolkhoz
Where's the crime, when no-one's really losing?
Out of cash? Why don't you print some more

Full sails ahead, oceans painted red
When the soldiers of fortune hunt for pirates
No questions asked, we fulfil our task
Tones all turn grey after sunset

Slaying a man, taking what you can
What is right, what is wrong, who can answer?
Sailing the seas, we do just what we please

Emperors, pirates; all cancer
Both we are but selfish chancers
Taking what's there
