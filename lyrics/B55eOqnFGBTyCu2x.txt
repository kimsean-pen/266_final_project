Fixing your brain, it cost so much
Rigging the game, it cost so much
Releasing the pressure and pain, it cost so much

But now, we're ready to spend, we're ready to spend

Surfing the waves, it cost so much, it cost so much
Walk on this edge, it cost so much, it cost so much
Betraying the pledge, it cost so much, it cost so much

But now, we're ready to spend, we're ready to spend

Au Soir tout aligne (?), it cost so much, it cost so much
Nourrir les vivent, it cost so much, it cost so much
Eviter ou mieux que Ã§a saigne (?), it cost so much, it cost so much

But now, we're ready to spend, we're ready to spend

Escaping the frame, it cost so much, it cost so much
Not living in vain, it cost so much, it cost so much
Get your fifteen minutes of fame, it cost so much, it cost so much

But now, we're ready to spend, we're ready to spend
