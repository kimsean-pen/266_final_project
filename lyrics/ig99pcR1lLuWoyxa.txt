There was snow, there was snow
Stretched for miles and more
Where we buried, where we buried
Our souls

Oh I long, Oh I long
For them days left and gone
Where we sang and where we danced to a brighter song

But now I look upon a field with bodies stretched out and I feel nothing
But something's burning in my soul I let it lose control and I'm in

Oh God I've sinned
But I tried so hard, and we tried so hard
And it's a long long road, that you told me so
Yeah I tried so hard, to forget where we are

And all we do is laugh and we sing
And we laughed oh, and we cried and thought
Oh, what a life

And we laughed oh, and we cried and thought
Oh, what a life
And we laughed, and we cried and thought
Oh, what a life

But I tried so hard, but we killed our hearts
In valleys low, I hear the trumpets blow
Yeah, I tried so hard, yet I'm lost and scarred

And I'm filled with regret yet I sing
And we laughed oh, and we cried and thought
Oh, what a life
And we laughed oh, and we cried and thought
Oh, what a life
And we laughed, and we cried and thought
Oh, what a life
And we laughed oh, and we cried and thought
Oh, what a life.
And we laughed oh, and we cried and thought
Oh, what a life.
And we laughed, and we cried and thought
Oh, what a life.
