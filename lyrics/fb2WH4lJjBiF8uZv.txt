After every shape and size and colour
No boots or shoes can seem to kick these royal blues
Staying sticky from a sizzling hot summer
Red hot for you has gone and turned to royal blues

Oh when we first kissed at the bus stop the ground fell out under us
Drinking each other up like we were both a bottomless cup
Getting drenched in your sweat and the scent of our sex
And the next thing I know I know I know I know it all

Oh

Royal blues, and I'm getting it all over you
Royal blue, what's a girl to do
Royal blue, are we cool
Oh royal blue

I kick off [?]
But then again maybe I'm right the way I am
And when we all just fit to the same colour
Oh royal blue do I just go better with you

We were so soft to the touch and so deep in this love
Did we want way too much, more than we could ever give up
Still I'm drenched in your sweat and the scent of our sex
And the next thing I know I know I know I know it all

Go on

Royal blues, and I'm getting it all over you
Royal blue, what's a girl to do
Royal blue, are we cool
Oh royal blue

Oh when we first kissed at the bus stop the ground fell out under us
Drinking each other up like we were both a bottomless cup
Getting drenched in your sweat and the scent of our sex
And the next thing I know I know I know I know it all

Those royal blues
Royal blue, what's a girl to do
Royal blue, are we cool
Are we cool

Royal blues, and I'm getting it all over you
Royal blue, what's a girl to do
Royal blue, are we cool
Oh royal blue

Are we cool
Oh royal blue
