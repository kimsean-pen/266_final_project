Like a candle
Burning bright
Love is glowing in your eyes
A flame to light our way
That burns brighter everyday
But now I have you
Nobody loves me like you do
Like a leaf
Upon the wind
I could find no place to land
I dream the hours away
And wonder everyday
Do dreams come true?
Nobody loves me like you do
What if I never met you?
Where would I be right now?
Funny how life just falls in place somehow
Ooh, you touched my heart in places
That I never even knew
'Cause nobody loves me like you do
I was words without a tune
I was a song still unsung
A poem with no rhyme
A dancer out of time
But now there's you
Nobody loves me like you do
What if I never met you?
Where would I be right now?
Funny how life just falls in place somehow
Ooh, you touched my heart in places
That I never even knew
Nobody loves me
(Nobody loves me)
Nobody loves me
(Nobody loves me)
Nobody loves me like you do
Nobody loves me like you do
