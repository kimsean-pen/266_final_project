Just remember to forget me
I hate this honestly
Please take this the wrong way
Don't need you to need me
I need you to disappear
'Cause I carry ghosts of the things you've said
But you won't come home even if you're dead

Night after night, sleepless in Phoenix
Tell me a lie, make me believe it
You've got me right where you haunt me
You've got me right where you haunt me

Your pieces are right here
But nothing really fits
I want you to want me (I want you to want me)
Then watch me disappear
'Cause I carry ghosts of the thing you've said
I lay my bones to rest

Night after night, sleepless in Phoenix
Tell me a lie, make me believe it
You've got me right where you haunt me
You've got me right where you haunt me (haunt me...)
Night after night, need you to know this
Tears me apart
I hope that you're hopeless too
(I hope that you're hopeless too)
(I hope that you're hopeless too)
(I hope that you're hopeless...)

I know, we can kiss the past goodbye
And I know, we can kiss the past goodbye
And I know, we can kiss the past goodbye (kiss the past goodbye...)

Night after night, sleepless in Phoenix
Tell me a lie, make me believe it
You've got me right where you haunt me
You've got me right where you haunt me (haunt me...)
Night after night, need you to know this
Tears me apart
I hope that you're hopeless too
You've got me right where you haunt me
You've got me right where you haunt me

And I know, we can kiss the past goodbye (kiss the past goodbye)
And I know, we can kiss the past goodbye (kiss the past goodbye)
And I know, we can kiss the past goodbye
