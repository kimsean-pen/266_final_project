Taking aim at the shooting range
But I hope your barrel's straight
They'll tease you and deceive you
Yeah, they'll smile right to your face
They're getting bolder
They're getting bolder
There's moonshine in the day time
Don't come here looking for a goldmine
The best you can do is track silver
Luck is a lady, try not to kill her

Welcome to Silvertown now
There's no leaving Silvertown now
Welcome to Silvertown now
There's no leaving Silvertown now

Hear a sound, drop to the ground
Your mouth is running strange
I told you
Yeah, I told you never give your pistol names
They're getting bolder
Yeah, they're getting bolder
A candy cane don't taste the same but sugar in the air
Lost in the desert, you kept it from water
I think you called her

Welcome to Silvertown now
There's no leaving Silvertown now
Welcome to Silvertown now
There's no leaving Silvertown now

oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Welcome to Silvertown now
There's no leaving Silvertown now
Welcome to Silvertown now
There's no leaving Silvertown now
Welcome to Silvertown now
