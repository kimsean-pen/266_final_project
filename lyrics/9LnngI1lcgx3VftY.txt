This love
This love is a strange love
A faded kind of mellow
This love

This love
I think I'm gonna fall again
And even when you held my hand
It didn't mean a thing, this love

This love
Now rehearsed we stay, love
Doesn't know it is love
This love

This love
It hasn't have to feel love
It hasn't need to be love
It hasn't mean a thing
This love

This love loves love
It's a strange love, strange love

This love
This love
This love is a strange love, strange love
I'm gonna fall again
It doesn't mean a thing
Think I'm gonna fall again
This love
