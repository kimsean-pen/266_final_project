I first let a cat out of the bag,
It scratched my eyes out, and ordered me to go
To answer all these questions I've had
Will it all become clear?
Will it all become clear now?

Go back, get her
Go back, get her
Go back, get her
Go back, get her
Go back and get her

Go back, get her
Go back, get her
Go back, get her
Go back, get her
Go back and get her

When I found that the ice was going to melt
The seagulls kept on landing on the ground
To answer all these questions I've had
Will it become clear?
Will it all become clear now?

Go back, get her
Go back, get her
Go back, get her
Go back, get her
Go back and get her

Go back, get her
Go back, get her
Go back, get her
Go back, get her
Go back and get her

Go back, get her
(Go back you better get her)
Go back, get her
(Go back you better get her)
Go back, get her
(Go back you better get her)
Go back, get her

Those four words were standing on
Those four words were standing on
Four words were standing on ghosts
Four words were standing on ghosts
Four words were standing on ghosts
Four words were standing on ghosts
