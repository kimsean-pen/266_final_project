They say freak
When you're singled out
The red
Well, it filters through

So lay down, the threat is real
When his sight goes red again

Seeing red again
Seeing red again

This change
He won't contain
Slip away
To clear your mind
When asked
Who made it show
The truth
He gives in to most

So lay down the threat is real
When his sight goes red again

So lay down the threat is real
When his sight goes red again
So lay down the threat is real
When his sight goes red again

Seeing red again
Seeing red again
Seeing red again
Seeing red again
Seeing red again
Seeing red again
Seeing red again
Seeing red

They say freak
When you're singled out
The red
It filters through
