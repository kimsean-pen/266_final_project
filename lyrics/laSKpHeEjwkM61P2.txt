Make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me down
Make me a pallet down, soft and low
Make me a pallet on your floor
Oh make me down

Make me down
Make me a pallet down, soft and low
Make me a pallet on your floor
Up the country
Up the country by the cold sleet and snow
I'm going up the country

By the cold sleet and slow
No telling how much further I may go
Oh make me down, make me down
Make me a pallet down, soft and low
Make me a pallet on your floor

Well, sleeping, my back and shoulders tire
Way I'm sleeping, my back and shoulders tire
The way I'm sleeping, my back and shoulders tired
Gonna turn over and try it on the side
Oh make me down, make me down

Make me a pallet down, soft and low
Make me a pallet on your floor
Don't you let my good girl catch you here
Please don't let my good girl catch you here
Oh she might shoot you

Might cut and starve you too
No telling what she might do
Oh make me down
Make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me a pallet down, soft and low
Make me a pallet on your floor
