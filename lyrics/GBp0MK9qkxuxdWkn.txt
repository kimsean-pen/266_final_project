Too close
Check it out

Baby, when we're grinding
I get so excited
Ooh, how I like it
I try but I can't fight it

Oh, you're dancing real close
Plus it's real, real slow
You're making it hard for me

All the slow songs you requested
You're dancing like you're naked
Oh, it's almost like we're sexing

Yeah, boo, I like it
You know I can't deny it
But I know you can tell I'm excited, ooh, girl

Step back, you're dancing kinda close
I feel a little poke coming through on you
Now girl, I know you felt it before you know I can't help it
You know what I wanna do
