Maybe I could speak
We can count our blessings in the rain
Talking is so cheap, save the parlor tricks, count your money alone

Holding on to the free
I want to show you all what I mean, careful what you say
And never underestimate the wait

I know you hear the songs that we could sing but do not stay
I hope you know the [change], I love the
And now we got the [change], we make the song sound like what we want
Who am I to tell you what is wrong
Talking is so cheap, so save the politics, you can never get rid of me

I tell you everything, I write it down
Well, I sew my body to yours so that I can speak
But my serpent-hands are holding me
But, my razor tongue will fix it all away
It might be two dimensional, but the story is great
I sew my body to yours so as I can see the lovers
in the front row and all the ghosts in the back seat
I sew my body to yours, so as I am free
There's two versions of my fate... and so we shall see

Wait, I know you hear the songs that we could sing
But do not speak
I hope you know the change
Wait, I love the change
And now we got the change
We make the song sound like what we want
We make the song sound like what we want

Put me in the dirt
