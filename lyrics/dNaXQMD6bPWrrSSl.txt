Please speak softly
For they will hear us
And they'll find out
Why we don't trust them

Speak up dear
'Cause I cannot hear you
I need to know

Why we don't trust them
Explain to me
This conspiracy against me

And tell me how
I've lost my power
Where can I turn?

'Cause I need something more
Surrounded by uncertainty
I'm so unsure of

Tell me why
I feel so alone
'Cause I need to know
To whom do I owe

Explain to me
This conspiracy against me
And tell me how

I've lost my power
I thought
That we'd make it
Because you said
That we'd make it through
And when all security fails
Will you be there
To help me through?
Explain to me
This conspiracy against me
And tell me how
I've lost my power... how?
I've lost my power
