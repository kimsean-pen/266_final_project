All I want is to be a part o' your weekend
All I need is a little bit o' your time
Baby, I'm your girl and I need some attention
When you ignore me I just lose my mind

I ain't gon' bug about you going out last night
Though, baby I know that I'm the only one in your side
But please don't tell me nothin'

I don't wanna know what you did last night
I don't wanna hear that you had a good time
I don't wanna know if it was all real or lie, yeah
I don't wanna feel like I had to be there
I Don't wanna know about the other girls there
I Just wanna know when you're around you're mine

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

I don't think that I'm being obsessive
I don't think that I'm being out of line
You had your space and I get to be selfish
You get yours baby, and I get mine

I'm doing just fine as long as we see eye to eye (you with me?)
And no no, ain't nothing wrong with going out and having a good time
But I don't wanna know nothin'

I don't wanna know what you did last night
I don't wanna hear that you had a good time
I don't wanna know if it was all real or lie, yeah
I don't wanna feel like I had to be there
I don't wanna know about the other girls there
I Just wanna know when you're around you're mine

I can only picture you out meeting someone new
Baby, got my mind gone wild
I know your love is true, but what's a girl to do
All I need is a sign (just give me a sign)
I get jealous, oh so jealous
Oh, I get jealous
Don't mess me up with whatever is down

I don't wanna know what you did last night (oh I know I don't know)
I don't wanna hear that you had a good time (I don't wanna hear about it)
I don't wanna know if it was all real or lie, yeah (whooo)
I don't wanna feel like I had to be there (don't wanna feel it)
I don't wanna know about the other girls there
I Just wanna know when you're around you're mine
