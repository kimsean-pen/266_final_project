Come into my life
Regress into a dream
We will hide and build a new reality
Draw another picture of the life you could have had
Follow your instincts and choose the other path

You should never be afraid
You're protected from trouble and pain
Why?
Why is this a crisis in your eyes again?

Come to be?
How did it come to be?
Tied to a railroad, no love to set us free
Watch our souls fade away and our bodies crumbling

Don't be afraid
I will take the blow for you
I've had recurring nightmares that I was loved for who I am
And missed the opportunity to be a better man
