Been working so hard
I'm punching my card
Eight hours, for what?
Oh, tell me what I got

I gotten this feeling
That time's just holding me down

I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town

Tonight I gotta cut loose, Footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise
Pull me up off my knees
Jack, get back
C'mon before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut Footloose

You're playing so cool
Obeying every rule
Dig way down in your heart
You're burning, yearning for some
Somebody to tell you
That life ain't passing you by
I'm trying to tell you
It will if you don't even try

You can fly if you'd only cut loose, Footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Oowhee, Marie
Shake it, shake it for me
Whoa, Milo
C'mon, c'mon let's go
Lose your blues
Everybody cut Footloose

(Oh-oh-oh-oh) cut footloose
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) cut footloose
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) cut footloose

First, we got to turn you around
Second, you put your feet on the ground
Third, now take a hold of your soul

I'm turning it loose, Footloose

Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise
Pull me up off my knees
Jack, get Mack
C'mon before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut Footloose

Footloose, (Footloose), footloose

Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise
Pull me up off my knees
Jack, get Mack
C'mon before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut footloose
