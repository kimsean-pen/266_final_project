There's a girl stuck in the middle
And she stares into my eyes
She says she kiss me tender
I say I don't love her but I know it's a lie

And lately she's been lonely
I couldn't tell you why
Ohh no
She lives without emotion
She makes me better
Only for the night
Only for the night
Only for the night yea yea
Only for the night yea yea

Ohh Last night I dreamt about her
Our bed is knocked on lies (?)
Her taste was so familiar
I say I don't need her but I know it's a lie

I swear that it's the last time that I lay down with her
Ohh she holds me when I'm shaking
And it makes me better
Only for the night
Only for the night
Only for the night yea yea
Only for the night yea yea

I swear I swear
Kiss me the last time
I'm dying
I swear I swear
Kiss me the last time
I'm dying

She use to dream of moving pictures
Now she slips into the sky

Lately I've been lonely
I couldn't tell you why
She live without emotion
It makes me better
Only for the night
Only for the night
Only for the night
