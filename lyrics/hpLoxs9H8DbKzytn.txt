(Verse)
My darling, you're giving something that I need
And I promised, you know I'll never leave.

(Pre-Chorus)
Can you tell me, "oh girl, you're the one"
Tell me anything, just to get what you want.

(Chorus)
I'm not the one to play with, don't you play, don't you play.
Say, I'm not the one to play with, don't you play, don't you play.

(Verse)
Oh, baby, that's what you call me when you say
"I love you, you are my everything"
Oh, aren't you sweet? You sound so good to me
But I've been the fool before, I can't do that anymore.

(Pre-Chorus)
So when you tell me "oh girl, you're the one"
I could really, but I rather won't.

(Chorus)
I'm not the one to play with, don't you play, don't you play.
Say, I'm not the one to play with, don't you play, don't you play.

(Bridge)
Oh, for real, you can't be serious
I've got to go, I think I've had enough.
I need you to tell me something new.

(Chorus)
I'm not the one to play with, don't you play, don't you play.
Say, I'm not the one to play with, don't you play, don't you play.
