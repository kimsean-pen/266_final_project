You make our decisions
You make our rules
Then you make us fight your stupid wars
That's going too far

Come on people, let me hear you say
You Bastards, you're gonna pay

You tell us not to steal
You tell us not to kill
Then you tell us to fight for your country
That's tell us to die

Come on people, let me hear you say
You Bastards, you're gonna pay

"Reach for yourself
And your battered mates
The time has come
I'm not talkin' about no revolution
I only want to find a solution
I want to change the world"

You can't fight 'em with words
You can't fight 'em with rage
Fight 'em with peace and love
It's our only chance

Come on people, let me hear you say
You Bastards, you're gonna pay
