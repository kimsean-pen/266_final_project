i did it alone in the snow
you wouldn't let go
couldn't let go
wouldn't let it inside
no matter how hard i tried
floating in an ocean alone
and you wanted devotion, i know
in the white i finally see
the light pouring all over me
i'm on my own
it's alright
i waited alone in the snow
i'm ready to go
i'm ready to know
wouldn't wanna go hide
no matter how hard i cried
floating in an ocean alone
but i know where i'm hoping to go
in the white i finally see
the light pouring all over me
i'm on my own
in white
in the white i finally see
the light pouring all over me
i'm on my own
in white
