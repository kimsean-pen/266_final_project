Sorcerers of madness
selling me their time
Child of God sitting in the sun
Keeping peace of mind
Fictional seduction
On a black snow sky
Sadness kills the superman
Even fathers cry

Of all the things I value most of all
I look inside myself
And see my world
And know that it is good

You know that I should

Superstitious centuries
Didn't time go slow
Separating sanity
Watching children grow
Synchronated undertaker
Spiral skies
Silver ships on plasmic oceans
In disguise

Of all the things I value most in life
I see my memories
And feel their warmth
And know that they are good

You know that I should

Watching eyes of celluloid
Tell you how to live
Metophoric motories
Say give, give, give
Laughter giving, love is showing
me the way
Spiral building architect
I build, you pay

Of all the things I value most of all
I look upon my Earth
And feel the warmth
And know that it is good

You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I should
