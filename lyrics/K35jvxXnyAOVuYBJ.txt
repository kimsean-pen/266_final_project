I have a secret i want to tell you
Each time that I close my eyes I can feel you
i ran away with my imagination
and i am blinded by your light that's filling up the room

I have a secret i need to tell you
exquisite visions fill up my mind

Do you remember me taking pictures of you?
as the light came through?
you were running away and i asked you for a place to stay
do you remember me taking pictures of you?
taking pictures of you...

I have a secret i need to tell you
I have been true and i needed no clue

We live in such extraordinary times
exquisite visions fill up my mind

Do you remember me taking pictures of you?
as the light came through?
you were running away and i asked you for a place to stay
do you remember me taking pictures of you
such a wonderful thing to do...
