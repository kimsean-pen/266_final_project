Traveling down
I left a piece
I left another one
Not to press it now
But now another one
Without a piece of all you have become
It's sensible
I sense that's overdone
Lots of people dropping by and I'm impressed
Give it off to me the same and I'm obsessed
Crafting every word or several in the past
And I thought that it'd last

I know it's coming
I'm not that strong
I've known it all along

Traveling down
I left a piece
I left another name
I sensed a pattern
Thought you'd feel the same
Lots of people dropping by and I'm impressed
Give it off to me the same and I'm obsessed
Crafting every word or several in the past
And I thought that it would last

I know it's coming
I know it's done
I know it's not enough

I know it's tragic
I know it's tough
I know it's not enough
