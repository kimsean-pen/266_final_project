Hm, some news
Give me some news
I have to know
By wind or by winding road
I have to know

My brother sin of sin
Tin cup rain goes straight to the brain
Just like a bullet
You attacked and stuck
You know I love you like Diane cluck

My sweet thing now your dead
Disappeared to fog
Like the neighbors dog
I know you love me
And you meant no harm
So all is forgiven from the dusty farm

Give me some news
I have to know
By wind or by winding road
I have to know

Don't forget all the times
I nearly died
In your arms like a daisy
Hot on a farm
My torture was thus I took what I must
Had to have you had to know
Now polished and pressed
Dressed to impress you falling all around
I'm outside the door
On you garden's floor
Bareing bossom a blossom
Soul reeking awesome

My lover ravaged thing
Heartache city don't go there again
Flicker your fire
But don't get burned
You know I love you ash to the urn

My holy unpredictable
My fable teller
My starry stellar
You know I loved you from first eyes we met
And now I'm ready red hot and wet

Give me some news
I have to know
By wind or by winding road
I have to know
