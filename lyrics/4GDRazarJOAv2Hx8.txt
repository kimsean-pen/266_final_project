Ive been waiting for forever
And its only just begun
For the seasons change
And the weather
Big blue skies
And a golden sun
All my dreams of endless fun
Are on my mind
And on the run

If theres time then weve got time to waste
Gotta find a place you can show your face
See the sweetest thing walking on the ground
Hey pretty lady wanna come on down
Come right on down to the magical sound
Hey pretty ladies come on down

Now ive finally learned tables turn
And you go burning up your pride
And you come on out from the inside
To see the bright blue day haze
Bright blue days

Gotta find gotta find a place
You can show your sweet face
Sun is time moon is a phase
In the bright blue day haze

Ive been waiting for forever
And its only just begun
For the seasons change
And the weather
Big blue skies
And a golden sun
All my dreams of endless fun
Are on my mind
And on the run
