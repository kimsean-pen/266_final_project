Drawn back to life from a storm so cold
Into comforting fire, a new dawn is rising
Unmasked, ready for deliverance
Rebirth through failure
Just like so many times before
They've been asking where you have been,
Why you haven't been around
Answers were always there but now lie deep in the trenches
Buried to the heart of ten thousand days
When you have lost all direction
Let the silence speak the loudest words
When you have lost all direction
Let the undone come to life
And that day we banished it all
For a moment everything was well
Revered all that was given and without a sound
Made a promise that tomorrow would be a good day
Buried to the heart of ten thousand days
When you have lost all direction
Let the silence speak the loudest words
When you have lost all direction
Let the undone come to life
And feel the love engraved
To the undivided presence of hope and innocence
Soulcarvers
