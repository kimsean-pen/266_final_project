You're my treasure and my trouble
You're the serum and the struggle
You're a ransom and an outrage
You're my kingdom in a bird cage

But I'm just blown away
I'm just blown away
I'm just blown away every time I look at you
I'm just blown away
I'm just blown away
I'm just blown away

You're my hangman and my hero
You're perpetual and you're zero
You're a rhapsody and a refuge
You're a dust storm, you're the deluge baby

But I'm just blown away
I'm just blown away
I'm just blown away every time I look at you
I'm just blown away
I'm just blown away
I'm just blown away

You're my treasure and my trouble
You're the serum and the struggle
You're the omen and the aftermath
The gallows and the line I've cast
You're the crown of thorns and the wishing well
The zodiac and the carousel
You're my delusions and my secrets
All the remnants and the regrets
You're my mortality
You're everything I've ever wanted to be

But I'm just blown away
I'm just blown away
I'm just blown away every time I look at you
I'm just blown away
I'm just blown away
I'm just blown away every time

I'm just blown away
