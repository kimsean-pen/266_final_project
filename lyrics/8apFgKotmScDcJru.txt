Take you by the hand and feed you
Do you really feel the need to talk about it?
Now you're fighting for your corner
Sayin' that you oughta laugh about it
You should get a little braver
Do us all a favor, shout about it

Sweet sour
Sweet sour
Sweet sour

Pick up your stitches
Better than your riches
Think about it
I know what you've been through
We don't really need to talk about it
It's just a little calmer
Tryin' to disarm ya
Shout about it

Sweet sour
Sweet sour
Sweet sour

Sweet sour
Sweet sour
Sweet sour
Sour by the minute but you're sweeter by the hour

You were none the wiser
Even though you tried to understand it
Try another spoonful
Love is to be truthful
Dance around it
It's just a little calmer
Tryin' to disarm ya
Shout about it

Sweet sour
Sweet sour
Sour by the minute but you're sweeter by the hour

Sweet sour (11x)

Sweet sour
Sweet sour
Sour by the minute but you're sweeter by the hour
