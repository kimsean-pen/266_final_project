Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la la la

It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
Sha la la la la
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart
Uh, oh, many, many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do
Can't help myself

'Cause baby, it's you
Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la
Baby, it's you
Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la
Sha la la la la

You should hear what they say about you (cheat, cheat)
Sha la la la la
They say, they say you never, never, never, ever been true (cheat, cheat)
Uh, oh, it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, and it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody

'Cause baby, it's you
Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la
Baby, it's you
Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la

Uh oh, it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, when it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody

'Cause baby, it's you
Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la
Baby, it's you
Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la
Don't leave me all alone
Come on home
Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la
