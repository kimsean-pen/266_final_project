My brain is made of straw
And my heart was forged from tin
My courage, although fierce, it is endangered
My sunflowers still grow
Though my monkeys have no wings
My path is paved in gold and filled with strangers
And the city made of green
Was a mirage filled with diversions
You notice when the smoke has cleared away
That that wizard was a hoax
And this old witch is scared of water
And home is always just three clicks away

Away...
Away...

My home was blown away
By a modern-age tornado
My aunt and uncle now live far away
And the lady riding by
Doesn't seem to make much progress
She's always exercising, night and day
And everything is black and white
Except these choices I am making
About the coloured boxes I could fit in
And the room, it gently spins
Like a politician's promise
To fix the weather with a weathered wallet
That she's gone and thrown away

Away...
Away...

I'm somewhere
Under the rainbow
Way down low

I'm under the waves and I am under the weather
I'm under the pump and I am under the pressure
And I am under the spell of a life lived in leisure
And I am underperforming and so under-pleasured

I'm under the waves and I am under the weather
I'm under the pump and I am under the pressure
And I am under the spell of a life lived in leisure
And I am underperforming and so under-pleasured
Pleasured...

And that road, it kept on winding
My companions were finding
That their memberships were ripe for cancelling
And that road, it kept on going
I left my friends there knowing
Their questions were not fit for answering
No
My questions are not fit for answering
