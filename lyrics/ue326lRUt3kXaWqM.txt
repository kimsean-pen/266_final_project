Can't slow down
Fearless reckless
All around
Immensely treacherous
All aboard
No one can stop us

You're going to judge me for what?
And all you wish is to ask
Why I'm so free and you live trapped

I've never cared for "your world"
And that's a matter of fact
So just try wrapping your brain around that

One more round
Fearless reckless
Lost and found
Immensely senseless

Bare witness to this contemptful display
As we decimate those who stand in our way

Can't slow down
Fearless reckless

Breathing and bleeding the grease through our brains
Impossibly endless forever reigns

Breathe Grease!
Breathe Grease!

Breathe Grease!
Breathe Grease!
