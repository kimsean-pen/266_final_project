You thought you'd set the bar
I'd never tried to work it out
We just lit the fire
And now you want to put it out
You gave it all you got
And what you got is not a lot
Why don't you hand it over
Time is up, you've had your shot

Gather once again, disasters in the end
it's like a default!

You thought you'd made the grade
All you made will start to fade
We threw it in the fire
it's better that it not remain

You just brought together
Didn't seem to have the heart
Wheels are coming off now
Knew that it would fall apart
Take one for the team
You're a cog in the machine
it's like a default

Take one for the team you're a cog in the machine
It's like a default

You've missed the starting gun
For everything you've ever done
You took part in the race
But disappeared without a trace
You thought you'd set the bar
I'd never tried to work it out
We just lit the fire
And now you want to put it out

Forget about the cause
press rewind then stop and pause
It's like a default
Forget about the cause
press rewind then stop and pause
It's like a default
