Our yesterday will not be our tomorrow.
Escape the past, erase this memory.
Let these words transpose our future, we wont be silenced.
Scream in harmony.
Listen to the voice of passion.
Sounds that make you want to be.
Listen to the voice of passion.
Sounds that make you want to be
Disconnected from all of the lies of the world.
Wheres the heart?

Let us embrace the sensation.
This is the dawn of our beginning.
Overthrow as we forge our path to conquer.
When all is gone who will remember our days?
When all is gone who will remain?

Our memory will always tell our story.
But not our fate, not our fate.

Taking everything
You thought was right and throwing it away.
Taking everything
You thought was right and throwing it away.
Pallets of our past will now fade into gray.
Among this set of our new complexion.
We watch as they dig their own graves.

Rising to immortality.
Why bathe in this sea of filth with all the rest of the world?
Our memory will always tell our story.
But not our fate, not our fate.
Our memory will always tell our story.
But not our fate, not our fate.
Not our fate.
