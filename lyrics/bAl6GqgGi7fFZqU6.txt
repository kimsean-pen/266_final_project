Even if you never strayed from me.
I'd question your fidelity.
There'd always be a shroud of suspicion,
and my heart's a liability.

With your hands maroon, so freshly red, you'd wrap your lips around my neck,
try and force to love the thought of me.
Simple motions make me ill.

Was it bitter when you tossed, and turned, on his undercover mattress?
Did it feel so good? Hope it felt so good.
Don't know what I'd do if you loss sleep over little old me.
He's so much better.
They're all much better.
Take off your sweater, your shoes, and your shirt, and get to work.

Maybe this is just a work of art.
Scripted players in a play of lust.
Hope the end is well worth waiting for.
Everything you wished it'd be.
Was it bitter when you tossed, and turned, on his undercover mattress?
Did it feel so good? Hope it felt so good.
Don't know what I'd do if you loss sleep over little old me.
He's so much better.
They're all much better.
Take off your sweater, your shoes, and your shirt, and get to work.

Oh my god, what have I done?
Now my darling put your clothes back on.
Oh my god, what have I done?
Now my darling put your clothes back on.

...because you can't be caught red handed if you're not red handed.
My darling, I would never say those words to you.
I was pulling out my heart so I could pin it to my sleeve,
on display for you to see I'm on display.
