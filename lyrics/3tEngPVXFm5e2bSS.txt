Alone again
And I can't find what went wrong
It's getting hard to hang
You're holdin' on

But when she comes around
She's the only love that I have found
O-oh, can't live without you

It's hard to see
Which way my love must go
Killing time looking for some hope

But when I see her now
She's the only joy my life will allow
O-oh, I'll search no longer
