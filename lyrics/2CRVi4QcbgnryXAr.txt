Head on the bathroom floor
Tackling in my demon voice
Millions of years go by
Memories of peace and love
Killing to reconstruct
And what will the label do?
Hurt people hurt people too

I'm sorry for what I've done

Head on the bathroom floor
Tackling in your demon voice
Millions of years go by
Memories of peace and love
Talking to the barking dog
Never mind the barking dog
Never mind the barking dog
Millions of years go by...

Head on the bathroom floor
Tackling in your demon voice
Millions of years go by
Memories of peace and love

I'm sorry for what I've done
And hurt people hurt people too
Hurt people hurt people too
Never mind the walking dog
Never mind the walking dog
Never mind the walking dog
