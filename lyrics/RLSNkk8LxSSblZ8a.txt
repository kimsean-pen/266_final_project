Nine below Zero on the outside,
But I brought my baby's temperature to a hundred and ten
Nine below zero out on the outside,
And I brought my baby's temperature to a hundred and ten
Ever since the little girl put me down for another man
I give 'r all of my money, my lovin' and everything
All of my money, all my lovin' and everything
I brought my baby's temperature up to a hundred and ten,
And she done put me down for another man
Temperature nine below zero on the outside,
I brought my baby's temperature up to a hundred and ten, oh yes I did
Nine below zero,
And I brought my baby's temperature up to a hundred and ten, oh yeah
Ever since then she done put me down for another man
