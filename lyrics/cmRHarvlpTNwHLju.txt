When I look to the future it's no good because it's out of focus
Taking comfort from the past, is what I do when I'm feeling helpless
I'm all for staying positive but there's something standing in the way
Repetition of the dullest form, I can feel my life eroding

Tunnel vision
This sick paranoia
I spend my days wishing them away
Strangest feeling, my life has turned to grey
I spend my days wishing them away

When I sleep I don't really sleep
I just lay there staring at my eye lids
I don't know what I want to do today or for the rest of my life

Tunnel vision
This sick paranoia
I spend my days wishing them away
Strangest feeling my life has turned to grey
I spend my days wishing them away
Today
Today is just a reflection
Of yesterday

Mirrored Reflection
