Shut your eyelids now and bite on your tongue
Under the darkness leave the conversation undone
All the sentences don't need to be said
Just keep real quiet we'll pretend that we're dead

I'm so tired, can't open my mouth
There's a fire, I can't put it out
I'm so tired, I can't put it out

Moving silent 'til you tell me to stop
But in your eyes I see you don't wanna turn it off
All around I feel it getting so close
Hiding way down here where nobody knows

I'm so tired, can't open my mouth
There's a fire, I can't put it out
I'm so tired, can't open my mouth
This desire, I can't put it out
