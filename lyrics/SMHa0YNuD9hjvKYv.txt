Running out of options,
Running out of road
Stopped to help me
Shoulder up my load
Invisible can't hear us,
We make no sight or sound
We're heading due
South to the underground

Supreme power and
An upper hand
Imported in, from
A foreign land
Some bad motherfuckers
Asking, where you been
I've been out on
The road again
Road kill, road kill
And cash in hand
Making hay in the native land
Viva the uproar, v
Vva the stand
We gone out on
The road again

Casting them in iron,
Casting the first stone
Stopped to breathe,
I knew we're not alone
The first he was a lion,
The second was a lamb
The third held
Proclamations for the damned

Don't leave me on the road
Don't leave me on the road
Don't leave me

Supreme power
And an upper hand
Imported in,
From a foreign land
Some bad motherfuckers asking,
Where you been
I've been out on
The road again
Road kill, road kill
And cash in hand
Making hay in
The native land
Viva the uproar,
Viva the stand
We gone out on
The road again

Hey don't you leave
Me on the road, on the road
Hey can you help
Me with my load to carry
Hey don't you leave me
On the road, on the road
Hey don't you leave me,
Leave me on the road

Supreme power
And an upper hand
Imported in, from a foreign land
Some bad motherfuckers
Asking, where you been
I've been out on
The road again
Road kill, road kill
And cash in hand
Making hay in
The native land
Viva the uproar,
Viva the stand
We gone out
On the road again

Running out of options,
Running out of road
Left to die
My soul out
On the road
