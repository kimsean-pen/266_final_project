No snow
Same every year so by now you should now
The drill
Mum buys you socks, so she loves you still
You're lying, if you can say your heart is not home
You're trying
To slide out of view, but Christmas is you

Busy the nights that brought us here
I didn't do this on my own, I know
That Christmas is the only time I'm home
Oh, Christmas is the only time I'm home

The toast to those that we love who cannot be here
The most glorious days that round off the year
You're slowly, if only for a minute or two
You're gliding just out of view, but Christmas is you

Heavy the nights that got us here
Oh more than we'll ever show, I know
That Christmas is the only time I'm home
Oh, Christmas is the only time I'm home
Oh, Christmas is the only time I'm home

Christmas is home
Turn off the phone
I'm fine all alone
But it's nice to be here with you

Christmas is home
Turn off the phone
I'm fine all alone
But it's nice to be here with you

Christmas is home
Turn off the phone
I'm fine all alone
But it's nice to be here with you

Christmas is home
Turn off the phone
I'm fine all alone
But it's nice to be here with you

Christmas is home
Turn off the phone
I'm fine all alone
But it's nice to be here with you

Christmas is home
Turn off the phone
I'm fine all alone
But it's nice to be here with you
