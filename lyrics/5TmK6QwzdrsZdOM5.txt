Now, during a scene
Seen it all before
We drink, we drink a little much
Drink a little more

To shake off the nerves and
To take off the edge and
Now is there any way back home?

Seen it all before and
I know the signs
We drink, drink a little much
To stimulate the mind

Now it's two hours to go
Insult everyone that we know
Now it's such a long way home

Maybe its time to go?
Maybe its time we went?
You are making a spectacle
Maybe its time we left?

I don't want to spoil your night
I don't want to hurt your pride
But maybe it's time to go
Maybe it's time?

Now eating from your hand
Laugh at every line
Soon losing track of you
Losing track of time
Now it is dead on the dance floor
And nobody is laughing anymore
Have I become a tiresome bore?

Maybe it's time to go?
Maybe it's time we went?
You are making a spectacle
Maybe it is time we left?

I don't want to spoil your night
I don't want to hurt your pride
But maybe it's time to go?
Maybe it's time to go?

Where there is nowhere to hide
From what is broken inside
A faultline rips right open
Under the wide wide ocean's tide
Under the wide wide ocean

Maybe it's time to go?
Maybe it's time we went?
You are making a spectacle
Maybe it is time we left?

I don't want to spoil your night
I don't want to hurt your pride
But maybe it's time to fly
Maybe it's time?

Maybe it's time to go?
Maybe it's time?
