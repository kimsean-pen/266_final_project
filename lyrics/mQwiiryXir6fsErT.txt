You won't get much closer
'Till you sacrifice it all (all)
You won't get to taste it
With your face against the wall (wall wall)
Get up and commit
Show the power trapped within (in in)
Do just what you want to
And now stand up and begin, uh

Oooh, one, two, three, four, fire's in your eyes
And this chaos, it defies imagination
Oooh, five, six, seven, eight minus nine lives
You've arrived at Panic Station

Doubts will try to break you
Unleash your heart and soul (soul)
Trouble will surround you
Start taking some control (trol!)
Stand up and deliver
Your wildest fantasy (sy-sy)
Do what the fuck you want to
There's no one to appease

Oooh, one, two, three, four, fire's in your eyes
And this chaos, it defies imagination
Oooh, five, six, seven, eight minus nine lives
You've arrived at Panic Station

Oooh, one, two, three, four, fire's in your eyes
And this chaos, it defies imagination
Oooh, five, six, seven, eight minus nine lives
And I know that you will fight for the duration

Oooh, one, two, three, four, fire's in your eyes
And I know I'm not resisting the temptations
Oooh, five, six, seven, eight minus nine lives
You've arrived at Panic Station
