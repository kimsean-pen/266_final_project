I go back to where I am losing
Lying down, I can't stand it
You cannot lose it when you knew it
All along through me

On my own through me
On my own

I didn't hear it when you said it
On my own, that I would like it
I guess I'll leave you when I'm leaving
My poor, poor soul, through me

On my own through me
On my own

Oh, I feel it going down
When I'm home I'm not around
Oh, I feel it going down
When I'm home I'm not around

Oh love this crying for a reason
Well it's all gone and I can taste it
And of the time that I spent losing
It's on my own, through me

On my own through me
On my own

Oh, I feel it going down
When I'm home I'm not around
Oh, I feel it going down
When I'm home I'm not around

Didn't want to get so low but I had to
I didn't want to get so low but I had to
I didn't want to get so low but I had to
I didn't want to get so low but I had to

And I'm good at lying down
Yeah, good at lying down, ooh
Put me down
Well I'm good at lying down

Oooh, but I had to
I didn't want to get so low but I had to
I didn't want to get so low but I had to
I didn't want to get so low but I had to
