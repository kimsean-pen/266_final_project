Feel the heat of a fire at your feet
Rising up, up one smoke ring at a time
In this life, we all get left behind
Someday it's gonna work out fine

Take it from me, don't let it melt your mind
Don't let it melt your mind
Don't let it melt your mind
Don't let it

Feel the heat of a fire at your feet
Rising up, up one smoke ring at a time
In this life, we all get left behind
'Cause someday it's gonna work out fine

Take it from me, don't let it melt your mind
Don't let it melt your mind
Don't let it melt your mind
Don't let it

Let's throw all our nets
Into a bed of flames
In that way, it's all the same in our heads
Good as dead, strike a match, start anew

Don't let it melt your mind
Don't let it melt your mind
Don't let it melt your mind
Don't let it melt your mind

Don't let it melt your mind
Don't let it melt your mind
