Bare eyes on the world are on me
I might not come back from this
On my knees
Fighting the future for all of my beliefs

Broken and discarded
Alone, alone and left behind
Living the illusion
Of life

I can't be, I can't be alive
(The sun gone down for the last time)
What have I, what have I done?

Who am I?
I'm a pawn and I've been lying to myself
Ain't caving in
My heart keeps beating
This fight I'm gonna win

I can't be, I can't be alive
The sun gone down for the last time
What have I, what have I done?
I can't tell right from wrong

All the pain I feel
All the pain I feel, blood and tears
You're the monster that brought me here
All the pain I feel

Who was I?
Just a pawn and I was lying to myself
Not giving in
My heart still beating

I can't be, I can't be alive
The sun gone down for the last time
What have I, what have I done?
I can't tell right from wrong

All the pain I feel
All the pain I feel, blood and tears
You're the monster that brought me here
All the pain I feel

All the pain I feel
All the pain I feel, blood and tears
You're the monster that brought me here
All the pain I feel
I can't tell right from wrong

I can't be, I can't be alive
The sun gone down for the last time
(For the last time)
What have I, what have I done?
I can't tell right from wrong
