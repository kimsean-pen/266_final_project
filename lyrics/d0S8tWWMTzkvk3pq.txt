Barking
Here north and nether he's bound
And here he dwell
Snarling
At passing ghosts though he guard
The gates of hel

They're leaving like a funeral
Procession on the prowl
Behind the hearse of all our hope
Their coming may forebode the
End of all wee once held high
Before us darkness gathers

You'll take the high road
I'll take the low road
Neither sand stays their striding
Nor does the dark and deep blue sea
Frontlines fell
You'll take the high road
I'll take the low road
Turned to stone by the sunrise
Hordes in the distance marching out
The gates of hel

Graven
Under the gathering grime
Statues forgrow
Fieldstones
Before the floodgates of time
Wayfarers flow

Their marching may grow louder
Than the thunder in the sky
Behind the hearse of all our hope
Our footfalls only fade into
The distant future far
Before the darkness gathers

You'll take the high road
I'll take the low road
Neither sand stays their striding
Nor does the dark and deep blue sea
Frontlines fell
You'll take the high road
I'll take the low road
Turned to stone by the sunrise
Hordes in the distance marching out
The gates of hel

They're leaving like a funeral
Procession on the prowl
Behind the hearse of all our hope
Their coming may forebode the
End of all wee once held high
Before us darkness gathers

You'll take the high road
I'll take the low road
Neither sand stays their striding
Nor does the dark and deep blue sea
Frontlines fell
You'll take the high road
I'll take the low road
Turned to stone by the sunrise
Hordes in the distance marching out
The gates of hel
