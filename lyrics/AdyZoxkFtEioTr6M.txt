Stay out late night, running red lights
That's the air we like to breathe
Breaking your ties, crossing your lines
Leaping over boundaries
There's never been a mold that you could fit us in
Doing what we're born to do is not a sin

'Cause we are gonna be, we are gonna be who we are
We don't really care, we don't really care what you want
Never put a we, never put a we in the box
Gotta let it go 'cause I'm telling you we won't stop

Because we are, we are, we are, we are
We are the young, we are the world
You know who we are
We are, we are, we are, we are
We are the young, we are the world
You know who we are
We might be reckless, but we're gonna do just what we do 'cause
We are, we are, we are, we are
We are the young, we are the world
You know who we are

You know who we are
You know who we are

Make our own rules, sticking like fools
Dare you to call the police
We can skip school 'cause we're too cool
To be told we can't be free
You can go ahead and try to knock us out
Ain't no keeping us from doing what we love
'Cause we love it too much

We are gonna be, we are gonna be who we are
Gotta let it go 'cause I'm telling you we won't stop, won't stop

Because we are, we are, we are, we are
We are the young, we are the world
You know who we are
We are, we are, we are, we are
We are the young, we are the world
You know who we are
We might be reckless, but we're gonna do just what we do 'cause
We are, we are, we are, we are
We are the young, we are the world
You know who we are

You know who we are
You know who we are

We don't hear what you're saying
Being us is okay and
We don't hear what you're saying
Being us is okay and

We might be reckless, but we're gonna do just what we do 'cause
We are, we are, we are, we are
We are the young, we are the world
You know who we are

You know who we are
You know who we are
You know who we are
You know who we are
We are, you know who we are
