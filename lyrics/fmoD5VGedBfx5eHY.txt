Catch you

You create misery
Have your cake and eat it

Take your place in history
And pray we don't repeat it

Call it fate, call it back[break]Call it off, don't call me later[break]
Lay your head in your bed
It's just how you made it

Out off my way I'm running
I'm gonna catch you if I can

Out off my way I'm coming
I'm gonna catch you if I can

Out off my way I'm running
I'm gonna catch you if I can

Out off my way start running
I'm gonna catch you

It's your day believe it
It's your date with destiny

It's too late to leave it
After all it's your, it's your party

Call it luck, call it fate
Call me beautiful to my face

Call it out to my to suprise
It's just how you made it

Out off my way I'm running
I'm gonna catch you if I can

Out off my way I'm coming
I'm gonna catch you if I can

Out off my way I'm running
I'm gonna catch you if I can

Out off my way start running
I'm gonna catch you

Out off my way I'm running
I'm gonna catch you if I can

Out off my way I'm coming
I'm gonna catch you if I can

Out off my way I'm running
I'm gonna catch you if I can

Out off my way start running
I'm gonna catch you

Catch you, catch you
