I can do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Now what's your name?

My name is Keri, I'm so very
Fly, oh my, it's a little bit scary
Boys wanna marry lookin' at my derriere
You can stare but if you touch it I'ma bury

Pretty as a picture
Sweeter than a swisher
Mad 'cause I'm cuter than the girl that's with ya
I ain't gotta talk about it, baby you can see it
But if you want, I'll be happy to repeat it

My name is Keri, I'm so very
Fly oh my it's a little bit scary
Boys wanna marry lookin' at my derriere
You can stare but if you touch it I'ma bury

Pretty as a picture (picture)
Sweeter than a swisher (swisher)
Mad 'cause I'm cuter than the girl that's with ya
I can talk about it 'cause I know that I'm pretty
And if you know it too then ladies sing with me

All eyes on me when I walk in
No question that this girl's a 10
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful

My walk, my talk, the way I drip
It's not my fault so please don't trip
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful (hey!)

Aye, now do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock
All my ladies do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock

(Now where you at?)

If you're lookin' for me you can catch me (hot spot)
Cameras flashin', bet he turn his head just as soon as I passed him (mmh)
Girls think I'm conceited 'cause I know I'm attractive
Don't worry about what I think, why don't you ask him? (oh ohh)

Get yourself together, don't hate (never do it)
Jealousy is the ugliest trait (don't ever do it)
I can talk about it 'cause I know that I'm pretty
And if you know it too then ladies sing with me

All eyes on me when I walk in
No question that this girl's a 10
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful

My walk, my talk, the way I drip
It's not my fault so please don't trip
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful

Doing the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock
All my ladies do the pretty girl rock, rock
Get low with your pretty girl rock, rock
Steal the show with your pretty girl rock, rock
