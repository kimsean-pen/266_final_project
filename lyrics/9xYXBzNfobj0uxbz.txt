Baby, baby
I'm gonna bring it on home to you
I've got my ticket, I've got that load
Got up, gone higher, all aboard
I'ma take my seat, right way back
Ooh yeah, I watch this train roll down the track
Gonna bring it on home

Bring it on home to you
Watch out, watch out that move
Try to tell you baby

What you tryin' to do
Tryin' to love me baby
Love some other man too
Bring it on home, bring it on home

Went a little walk downtown
Messed and got back late
Found a note there waiting

It said, Daddy, I just can't wait
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it back home, bring it back home to me baby
Tell you, pretty baby

You love to mess me 'round
I'm gonna give you lovin', baby
Gonna move you out of town
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Sweetest little baby, Daddy ever saw
I'm gonna give you lovin' baby
I'm gonna give you more
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it on home, alright
Bring it on home, bring it on home to you
