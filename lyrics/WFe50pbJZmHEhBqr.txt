Then again
And I think
Than again
We were sorry
and I want to love again
I could feel you but I couldn't say to you.
Whatever you do, I won't be sorry

No more honey

Much more
More than you ever know
In old days we waited by the telephone
You can loose it, loose it for the new you.
Whatever you do, I won't be sorry

No more honey
