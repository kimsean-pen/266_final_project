I can't handle these pressures
All I can say is, this stress hurts
Things are supposed to get better
I just need to put myself first
I'm always trying my hardest
Not to pick myself apart, this
Energy's killing my vibes now
Sometimes I just wanna drown out
All of the thoughts in my mind, too much
Going on at the same time, I
Wish it would stop and I've tried, but
Life just sucks then we all die

That's just reality, yeah, don't lie to me
Yeah, I'm fucked up, but I don't wanna be

I wonder if I'm good enough
Or maybe I've just had too much
To drink, to smoke, to swallow
I'm drowning up my sorrows
There's rules I'll never follow
Pretend there's no tomorrow
I wish there was no tomorrow

But I'm empty inside, yeah, I'm empty inside
And I don't wanna live, but I'm too scared to die
Yeah I'm empty inside, I just don't feel alive
And I don't wanna live, but I'm too scared to die

Wish I could erase my memories
So I could stop feeling so empty
I wish that shit wasn't so tempting
But it's hard to resist when there's plenty
Of things I could do to fuck me up
I want to let go, but I'm feeling so stuck
So all I can do is fill up my cup
And sit here alone hoping no one disrupts

That's just reality, yeah, don't lie to me
Yeah, I'm fucked up, but I don't wanna be

I wonder if I'm good enough
Or maybe I've had just too much
To drink, to smoke, to swallow
I'm drowning up my sorrows
There's rules I'll never follow
Pretend there's no tomorrow
I wish there was no tomorrow

But I'm empty inside, yeah, I'm empty inside
And I don't wanna live, but I'm too scared to die
Yeah, I'm empty inside, I just don't feel alive
And I don't wanna live, but I'm too scared to die

My body's shaking
My head is aching
It feels like my heart is breaking
My body's shaking
My head is aching
I can't fix this mess I'm making

But I'm empty inside, yeah, I'm empty inside
And I don't wanna live, but I'm too scared to die
Yeah, I'm empty inside, I just don't feel alive
And I don't wanna live, but I'm too scared to die
