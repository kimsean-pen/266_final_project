I'm standing on the edge,
The edge of sanity.
All I feel is emptiness,
My mind will never
Mourn in peace.

After all the tears,
Through all the years,
I'm still by your side,
In the land we cry.
After all the fights,
Beyond the lies,
When you want the best,
If only I could have guessed.

I must admire
My mind today.
I must admire
I must...
All my heart.

You will never understand
My pain, my suffering.
If only you could feel
What your hate does to me.
My will to live is weaker every day,
Soon the angels will arrive
To close my eyes.

And now the time has come
For me to face the end of my misery.
Seven floating tears in thy eyes.
Angel of mercy, carry me away.

I cry through the pain,
You name is sadness.
You cannot explain
The sign of thine.
I tried so far to change,
I tried to realize,
I wanted that
And tied us to self.

All life must die,
My life still change
Or stop today.
All my dreams are lost.
