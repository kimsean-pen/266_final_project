I'm married to

A terrific guy

I'll never leave

Until I die

But I just love to get out and get it on
I don't wanna live possessed by a memory
I want to be young, I want to dance with an abandon
And I don't care about the real thing

Everywhere I go

I'm reporting from the scene

Of somebody's

Missed opportunity

I love you
But it's not enough (but why?)
Baby, I just know there's so much more

But I just love to get out and get it on
I don't wanna live possessed by a memory
I want to be young, I want to dance with an abandon
And I don't care about the real thing
