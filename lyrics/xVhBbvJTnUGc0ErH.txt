You can look a hurricane right, in the eye
Twelve hundred people that are, left to die
Follow the leaders, were it an eye
For an eye we'd all blind
Deaf of murdered, of this I'm sure
In this unsettled time

So come pull a sheet over my eyes
So I can sleep tonight
Despite, what I've seen today
I find you guilty of a crime
Of sleeping at a time
When you should have been wide awake

Down on the road the world is, floating by
The poor and undefended, left behind
While you're somewhere trading lives for oil
As if the whole world was blind

So come pull a sheet over my eyes
So I can sleep tonight
Despite, what I've seen today
I find you guilty of a crime
Of sleeping at a time
When you should have been wide awake

So come pull a sheet over my eyes
So I can sleep tonight
Despite, what I've seen today
I find you guilty of a crime
Of sleeping at a time
When you should have been wide awake

Wide awake
Wide awake
Wide awake
Wide awake
