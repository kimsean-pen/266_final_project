When dreams can't wait a flood of fate
Is breaking over all that we know
I know a place to go escape
But lately I get lost on the road

And I don't really know just how to say it
We speak all day and never talk
Cause you and me were never complicated
So how'd we end up on the rocks

The tidal wave is forcing us to swim at a distance
So our love is washing away
With all the push and pull we're caught up in
Can we brave the tidal wave

I throw a line and every time
I'm freaking out and sinking inside
I hope we find a ground that's high
Just know my love will never subside

And I don't really know just how to say it
We speak all day and never talk
Cause you and me were never complicated
So how'd we end up on the rocks

The tidal wave is forcing us to swim at a distance
So our love is washing away
With all the push and pull we're caught up in
Can we brave the tidal wave

Oh oh oh
Can we brave the tidal wave
Oh oh oh
Can we brave the tidal wave
Oh oh oh
Can we brave the tidal wave
Oh oh oh
Can we brave the tidal wave

The tidal wave is forcing us to swim at a distance
So our love is washing away
With all the push and pull we're caught up in
Can we brave the tidal wave

Oh oh oh
Can we brave the tidal wave
Oh oh oh
Can we brave the tidal wave
Oh oh oh
Can we brave the tidal wave
Oh oh oh
Can we brave the tidal wave
