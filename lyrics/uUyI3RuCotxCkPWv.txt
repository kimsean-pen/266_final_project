Called me up one day,
Said you didn't mind,
Just called to find out,
What you thought already.

What you hoped I'd say,
That you were my one true love, a lie but
It'd keep you happy.

So I told the truth,
Look at where it got me,
Girl did you have to mention,
Girl whatcha say...

Whatcha say, Whatcha say,
Why you gotta be like that,
Why you gotta be like that?
Is she not gonna take me back? x2

Said you wanna know-ow-ow-ow.
But I know you don't,
But i know you don't.

You liked getting laid,
And it's not like you laid all,
All your cards out,
Face up on the table.

Never broke no rules
Never crossed no boundaries,
Girl did you have to mention,
Girl tell me what to do.

x1

You said you wanna know,
You said you wanna know,
But I know you don't,
But I know you don't.

You said you wanted names,
You said you wanted dates,
But I know you don't,
But I know you don't.

You said you have your cake,
You said you'd eat your cake,
But you know I won't.

Said you wanna know-ow-ow-ow...

Why you gotta be like that,
Why you gotta be like that.

Whatcha say, Whatcha say,
Why you gotta be like that,
Why you gotta be like that,
Is she not gonna take me,

Said you wanna know-ow-ow-ow-ow...
Why you gotta be like that,
Is she not gonna take me,

Said you wanna know-ow-ow-ow-ow...
Why you gotta be like that,
You ain't gonna have me back,

You ain't gonna have me back.
