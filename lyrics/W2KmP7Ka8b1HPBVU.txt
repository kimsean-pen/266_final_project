Hold that chrysalis in your palm,
see it split and change.
It won't do you any harm,
it's just trying to rearrange.
It was born to live a day,
now it flies up from your hand.
It's beautiful,
it's the one they call your ever-loving man.

Wolves have carried your babies away,
oh, your kids drip from their teeth.
The nights are long and the day
is bitter cold beyond belief.
You spread yourself like a penitent
upon the mad vibrating sand,
and through your teeth
arrange to meet your midnight man.

Everybody's coming round to my place.
Everybody's coming round to my place.
Everybody's coming round.
Oh, baby, don't you see?
Everybody wants to be
your midnight man

Don't disturb me as I sleep,
treat me gentle when I wake.
Don't disturb me as I sleep,
even though your body aches
even though your body aches
to serve at his command.
Between the wars
she still adores her ever-loving man.

Close your eyes, sleep in him,
dream of your lost sons and daughters.
Me, I'll raise up the dorsal fin
and glide up and down the waters.
I'll glide up and down the waters
then I'll walk upon the land,
and call 'em out,
the ones who doubt your midnight man.

Everybody's coming round to my place.
Everybody's coming round to my place.
Everybody's coming round.
Oh, darling, don't you see?
Everybody wants to be
your midnight man

It's early in the morning
and I don't know what to do.
It's early in the morning
and I can't believe it's true.
It's early in the morning
and it's happening again;
I called you once, I called you twice.
Ain't I your midnight man?

Everybody's coming round to my place.
Everybody's coming round to my place.
Everybody's coming round.
They want you, they love you.
They need to be
your midnight man.

Everybody's coming round to be your midnight man.
