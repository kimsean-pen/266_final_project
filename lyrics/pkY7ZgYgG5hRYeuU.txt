Don't you think about me the way I think about you,
Feel like I'm goin' crazy
Don't you want me the way that I want you,
Whatever you need me to do I'll do for you
You make me feel like I'm on cloud 9
You got me open I wanna give you my time
Just a touch from you is all I need,
To make me feel like I can barely breathe
(Breathe)

I'm overdosin' over your love
I feel like I'm an addict with a habit and your the drug.
I'm overdosin' over your love
Don't care what you put me through, I can't get enough of you
(I can't, I) can't get enough of you
(I can't, I) can't get enough of you
(I can't, I) can't get enough of you
(I can't, I) can't get enough of you

I tried, but I can't seem to come down now
How, your love is what I can't deny
I feel like I'm goin' up every time that we touch
But then you walk away
Wish that you was here to stay
You make me feel like I'm loosing my mind
I don't want you to go 'cause I just might start having withdrawals,
I can't go for all
I want you next to me, baby
(Baby)
'Cause I never felt like this,
I just can't help it,
I just need another hit
Boy you got me floating
Baby please don't stop,
Gimme everything you got.
Can we do it again?
Don't stop the feeling.

I'm overdosin' over your love.
I feel like I'm an addict with a habit and your the drug.
I'm overdosin' over your love.
Don't care what you put me through, I can't get enough of you.
(I can't, I) can't get enough of you
(I can't, I) can't get enough of you
(I can't, I) can't get enough of you
(I can't, I) can't get enough of you

Can't get you outta my head
I feel I'm goin' insane
I can't wait to feel your touch again
I'm waking up calling your name
I'm overdosin (uh oh), dosin (uh oh)
I'm overdosin (uh oh), dosin (uh oh)
I'm overdosin (uh oh), dosin (uh oh)
I'm overdosin (uh oh), dosin (uh oh)
(Uh oh)
