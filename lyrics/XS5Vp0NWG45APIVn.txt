Give in this time and show me some affection
(Give in and show us some.)
We're going for those pleasures in the night
(Tonight, tonight.)
I want to love you, feel you,
Wrap myself around you.
I want to squeeze you, please you,
I just can't get enough.
And if you move real slow, I'll let it go
I'm so excited, I just can't hide it,
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it.
I'm so excited, I just can't hide it,
I know, I know, I know, I want to.
(I know, I know, I know, I want to.
I know, I know, I know, I want to.
I know, I know, I know, I want to.)

We shouldn't even think about tomorrow
(I know, I know, I know.)
Sweet memories will last a long long time
(I know, I know, I know.)
We'll have a good time baby don't you worry
(I know, I know.)
And if we're still hangin' around well that's just fine.
Let's get excited,
(Look what you do to me,)
That we just can't hide it.
(You've got me burnin' up.)
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it.

(How did you get to me?)
I just can't hide it
(How bout you give it up?)
I know, I know, I know, I want you, I want you.
