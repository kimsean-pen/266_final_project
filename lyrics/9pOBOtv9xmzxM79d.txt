Oh, I don't want to try it
'Cause I'm scared that I'm gonna like it
And I can look, but I'm not going to buy it
'Cause my heart, heart is on a diet

But you give off something so cool (you do, you do)
So I guess I'm bending my rules (for you, for you)

Let's pretend that it's a holiday
Boy you know it's only temporary
Just a kiss I'm gonna blow away
Like a Valentine in February
Up all day and up all night
We're not wasting our precious time
We know it's never going past today
So why not make it legendary?

No, you can't get a witness
To testify about all of the kisses
When it's gone you know you going to miss this
At least you'll check, check me off your wish list

Yeah I give off something so cool (I do, I do)
And I'll give a little to you (to you, to you)

Let's pretend that it's a holiday
Boy you know it's only temporary
Just a kiss I'm gonna blow away
Like a Valentine in February
Up all day and up all night
We're not wasting our precious time
We know it's never going past today
So why not make it legendary?

Hurry up before you're out of time (so come on boy hurry up)
Better do it before I change my mind (before I don't give a what)
Hurry up before you're out of time (so come on boy hurry up)
Better do it before I change my mind (before I don't give a what)

Let's pretend that it's a holiday
Boy you know it's only temporary
Just a kiss I'm gonna blow away
Like a Valentine in February
Up all day and up all night
We're not wasting our precious time
We know it's never going past today
So why not make it legendary?
