Stress breaking my back
Pulse is stuttering
Pressure mental attack
My thoughts cluttering

Beating this dead horse is exhausting
Heartbreaking to see my hands shaking
I'm knee-deep in the dead, still wading
Still wading in this, this well called life

Nervousness halting all will
Forcing apathy, anxiety, an aching chill
Hammering down me

Beating this dead horse is exhausting
Heartbreaking to see my hands shaking
I'm knee-deep in the dead, still wading
Still wading in this, this well called life

Tread the floods so you can hope to seize
Your own reality (be)'fore if escapes thee
Watch yourself drown in disarray
It's time to break away or we'll die today
Tread the floods so you can hope to seize
Your own reality (be)'fore if escapes thee
Watch yourself drown in disarray
It's time to break away or we'll die today
