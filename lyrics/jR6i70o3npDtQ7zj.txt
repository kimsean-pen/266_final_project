You're perfect and its worth it
But you're not real, but you're not real
Cause I made you with science
You're in my head, you're in my head

Don't leave, don't leave my arms

I tried to, kiss you
But I'm quiet, but I'm quiet
When you're gone, I'll need a real girl
But I don't want her, but I don't want her

Don't leave, don't leave my arms
