Every lie you've ever been sold
The greatest story ever told
The circling bird of prey
Above a church on a Sunday

I'll wrap myself in you
A little something that I can cling to
Oh, there you are, my love
There you are, my love

Rain down through my hands
Scream out like children
My heart is a church bell ringing

You are a shiver
The gold and the silver
My heart is a church bell ringing

Every lie you've ever been sold
The greatest story ever told
The circling bird of prey
Above a church on a Sunday

Rain down through my hands
Scream out like children
My heart is a church bell ringing
oh no no

You are a shiver
The gold and the silver
My heart is a church bell ringing
To the birds, to the birds, to the birds
To the birds, to the birds, to the birds

You are a shiver
The gold and the silver
You are a shiver
The gold and the silver
