Drive yourself right up the wall
No one hears and no one calls
It's a boring state
It's a useless wait, I know

Brag about things you don't understand
A girl and a woman, a boy and a man
Everything is sexually vague
Now you're wondering to yourself if you might be gay

Your age is the hardest age
Everything drags and drags
One day baby
Maybe help you through

Drive your ma to the bank
Tell your pa you've got a date
You're lying
Now you're lying on your back

Tryin' to figure out, they wonder what next you'll pull
You don't understand anything sexual
I don't understand
Tell my friends I'm doing fine

Your age is the hardest age
Everything drags and drags
You're looking funny
You ain't laughing, are you?

Sixteen blue
Sixteen blue
Sixteen blue

Your age is the hardest age
Everything drags and drags
You're looking funny
You ain't laughing, are you?

Sixteen blue, sixteen blue
Sixteen blue, sixteen blue
Sixteen blue, sixteen blue
You're mine if you want to
