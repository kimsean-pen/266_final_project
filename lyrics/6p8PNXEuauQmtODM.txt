"Well I know you can't work in fast food all your life
But don't sign that paper tonight,"
She said, but it's too late.

And I don't remember what I read
Don't remember what they said
I guess it doesn't matter
I guess it doesn't matter anymore

'Cause you're gonna go to the record store
You're gonna give 'em all your money
The radio plays what they want you to hear
They tell me it's cool
I just don't believe it

Sell out with me, oh yeah
Sell out with me tonight
The record company's gonna give me lots of money
And everything's gonna be
Alright

No more flippin' burgers
Puttin on my silly hat
You know I don't want that no more
And I didnt ask when we get paid
Quit my day job anyway
I guess it doesn't matter
Guess it doesn't matter anymore

'Cause you're gonna go to the record store
You're gonna give 'em all your money
The radio plays what they want you to hear
They tell me it's cool
I just don't believe it

Sell out with me, oh yeah
Sell out with me tonight
The record company's gonna give me lots of money
And everything's gonna be

And I don't think it'll be so bad
And I know it won't be so bad
'Cause the man said that's the way it is
And the man said
"It don't get better than this."
No, no, no

So I signed on to the record company
They said they're gonna gimme lots of money
If I play what they want you to hear
They tell me it's cool
and I sure believe it

Sell out with me, oh yeah
Sell out with me tonight
The record company's gonna give me lots of money
And everything's gonna be
Alright
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
The record company
Is gonna make everything alright
"Baby don't you sign that paper tonight," she said
But I can't work in fast food all my life.
