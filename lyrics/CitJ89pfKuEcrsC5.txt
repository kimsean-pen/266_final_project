(Give me summer)
(Give me summer)

(Give me summer)
(Give me summer)

Broken darkness my cold end
I look for places I've never seen
Nothing moves but the quiet on the street
Now I open my eyes to this

Isolated, walking long hard hours
When a cold springs me with its shower
It's so brutal with the cold sky
Wrapped in cold, late at night

(Give me summer)
(Give me summer)

Come clean, there's no sun yet
The only lights here are naked
I can't speak, I can't hear, but I know I'm real
There's no warm here anyway

The darkest light's before the dawn
You remember the sun, but it sank
In the water that eats the light
Wrapped in cold, late at night

(Give me summer)
(Give me summer)

I open my eyes, it's cold
The errant souls go by
Lift the bridge out of the water
The stone black, light

Living is easy when it's night
The cold has covered the rain
I can see forever, to the deep
Wrapped in cold, late at night

(Give me summer)
(Give me summer)

(Give me summer)
(Give me summer)
