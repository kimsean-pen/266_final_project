Some people stand in the darkness
Afraid to step into the light
Some people need to help somebody
On the edge of surrenders inside

Don't you worry,
it's gonna be alright
'cause I'm always ready
I won't let you outta my sight

(I'll be ready) I'll be ready
(Whenever you fear) oh don't you fear
(I'll be ready)
Forever and always, I'm always here

In us we all have the power
But sometimes it's so hard to see
And instinct is stronger than reason
It's just human nature to me

Don't you worry,
it's gonna be alright
'cause I'm always ready
I won't let you outta my sight

(I'll be ready) I'll be ready
(Whenever you fear) oh don't you fear
(I'll be ready)
Forever and always, I'm always here

'cause I'm always ready
I won't let you outta my sight

(I'll be ready) I'll be ready
(Whenever you fear) oh don't you fear
(I'll be ready)
Forever and always, I'm always here
Forever and always, I'm always here
