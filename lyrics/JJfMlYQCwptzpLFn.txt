I'll meet you in the city
I'll pick you up at night
I'll drive you through the suburbs
I'll get you there in time
I'll meet you in the city
I'll stay clear of the light
I'll get us through the checkpoints
Yeah I know we'll be alright

Oh Julian
Once we get across the border
Oh Julian
I'll mend your heart
Oh Julian
Once we get across the border
Oh Julian
I'll mend your heart

And maybe we are sinners
But love ain't no crime
I'll get you through the checkpoints
I'll drive us through the night
You know I'll keep your secret
I've locked it up inside
As long as we are moving
Yeah I know it'll be all right
Yeah I know it'll be all right

Oh Julian
Once we get across the border
Oh Julian
I'll mend your heart
Oh Julian
Once we get across the border
Oh Julian
I'll mend your heart

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Well love it ain't no crime
Oh oh oh oh oh
Well love it ain't no crime

Oh Julian
Oh Julian
I'll mend your heart

Oh Julian
Once we get across the border
Oh Julian
I'll mend your heart
Oh Julian
(Well love it ain't no crime)
(Well love it ain't no crime)
Oh Julian
(Well love it ain't no crime)
I'll mend your heart
