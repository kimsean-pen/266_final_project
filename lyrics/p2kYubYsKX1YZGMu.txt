And if this is one of your ten thousand Dollar hours
Don't forget to write it down, help is on the way

Skip the cloak and dagger bit
Don't you know we're sick of it
As much as I would like to stay
The message light just blinks away
And while I'm here you won't push play

So you leave me no choice in the matter
You leave me no choice in the matter
You leave me no choice in the matter
You leave me no

Option to indulge in this
Exercise in cowardice
Ignorance without the bliss

'Cause you leave me no choice in the matter
You leave me no choice in the matter
You leave me no choice in the matter
You leave me no

'Cause I know where this boat will go
Pulled down by the undertow
It's lucky I know how to row

So row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream
I hope you drown and never come up

'Cause you leave me no choice in the matter
You leave me no choice in the matter
You leave me no choice in the matter
You leave me no
