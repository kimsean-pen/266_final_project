Dipping up around the bend
I'm sure tied up and I don't know when
You know there's just a couple of things that I like
Meet you woman at a quarter of three
Now get down on your bending knees
You know there's just a couple of things that I like

Don't get busted and ashamed
I'm looking off of you time and time again
The holy one, the nightingale, laughing on your way to hell

Look a little down the road
You hit it and you quit it and you already know
There's everything now passed you by
Alone you'll be, your well run dry

You started, then forgot it
And baby... well just let it be
Until then, there's the weekend, until then...

So won't you write to me and tell me your great story
About a little nobody who stole a whole of
a golden bowl of shit, Goddamnâ€”sorry for Ann
The bigger and the thick up with the only man
You're in my skin, you're on my tongue
And girl, my dusty bell you rung

I don't care if you have indecision
When I see you down girl, you know I'll be grinnin'
I don't care if they wrap you in linen
When you come around girl, no fuck will be given
I don't care if you have superstition
Everywhere you go you'll see my apparition
I don't care if you're safe and you're sound
You're gonna scream my name when my ghost... comes around

You started, then forgot it, and baby... won't you stay with me
Until then, there's the weekend, until then...

You started, then forgot it, and baby... won't you stay with me
Until then, there's the weekend, until then...
