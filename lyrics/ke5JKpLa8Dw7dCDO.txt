Once my lover, now my friend
What a cruel thing to pretend
What a cunning way to condescend
Once my lover, and now my friend

Oh, you creep up like the clouds
And you set my soul at ease
Then you let your love abound
And you bring me to my knees

Oh, it's evil, babe, the way you let your grace
Enrapture me
When well you know I'd be insane to ever let that
Dirty game recapture me

You made me a shadowboxer, baby
I wanna be ready for what you do
And I've been swinging around
Cause I don't know when you're gonna make your move

Oh, your gaze is dangerous
And you fill your space so sweet
If I let you get too close
You'll set your spell on me

So darlin' I just wanna say
Just in case I don't come through
I was on to every play
I just wanted you

But oh, it's so evil, my love, the way you've no
Reverence to my concern
So I'll be sure to stay wary of you, love
To save the pain of once my flame and twice my burn

So I'm a shadowboxer, baby
I wanna be ready for what you do
And I've been swinging around
At nothing I don't know
When you're going to make your move

Yeah I'm a shadowboxer, baby
I wanna be ready for what you do
And I've been swinging around
Cause I don't know
When you're going to make your move
