I know somethings bound to change
And I know I have been to blame
Watching the way this era of madness wont come and spread no shame
Cause I've been waiting watching and praying for you to go insane.
I've been holding out come on out and find me cuz I've been waiting my turn
With you alone now your heart is beating
So the sound of my name and i say
Find me find me come on out and find me
Find me find me
Don't defy it burning the thought of
Calling back your name
Maybe its not different because i see some play you did
Look at the voices something one and take one
Back where you're insecure
So now your crying open your mind to hide what your looking for
Okay hold me now and come on out and find me

Cause ive been waiting my turn
With your love now your heart is beating so the sound of my name
And i say, find me find me come on out and find me
Find me find me
With your love now
This is your smile oh need or want to get you
Anywhere anymore anymore
ANYMOREEE hold me now come on out and find me
Cuz I've been waiting my turn
With your love now your heart is beating
So the sound of my name
Find me find me
Come on out and find me
Find me find me
Ooooh!

Hold me now come on out and find me
Cuz I've been waiting my turn
With your love now your heart is beating
So the sound of my name come on out and find me
