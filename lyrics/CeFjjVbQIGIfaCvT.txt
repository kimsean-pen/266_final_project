We won't reveal our ailments and what haunts our sleep nightly
In this tiny little world, we've locked ourselves in so tightly
And the dead stand between us like wraiths and the people we've abandoned,
The life, we've surrendered to the streams

Oh Rhodesia, given you my vow
And I owe nothing
Nothing and nothing and nothing and nothing

One fire fights one fire
One-nil, one-nil
Rights by rights falter
Strengths by strengths do fail

All that's left now are dreams of kings we've murdered to dissect
For our meddling intellect misshapes the beauteous forms of things
So we bleat a little, twist a little, rotting in the belly of the beast
While you feel you cannot be wrong

Oh Rhodesia, given you my vow
And I owe nothing
Nothing and nothing and nothing and nothing

One fire fights one fire
One-nil, one-nil
Rights by rights falter
Strengths by strengths do fail

Oh Rhodesia, given you my vow
And I owe nothing
Nothing and nothing and nothing and nothing

One fire fights one fire
One-nil, one-nil
Rights by rights falter
Strengths by strengths do fail
