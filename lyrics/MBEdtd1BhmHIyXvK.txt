Above, below
Under a lonely star
Head to toe, hand in hand
It gets a whole lot better

If your telephone rings at night
Would you put some time aside
To shut your eyes and fall apart
Under the light of a lonely star
My one and only lonely star

Above, below
Under a lonely star
Another day to sit around and dream
As far as I can see
As long as memory
I'll be watching from afar
Under the light of a lonely star
My one and only lonely star

Fire burning
Clean-cut flowers in the yard
Daylight turning
All the sleeping statues into girls
I feel nothing
Sleep is never coming
I hear laughter from afar
Must be the song of a lonely star

If you knew what would happen
Then you'd never set foot in the mansion door
So many voices singing all of your praises
It gets a whole lot better
It gets a whole lot better
I hope it gets a whole lot better

If you leave, please don't go far
I need the light of a lonely star
My one and only lonely star
My one and only lonely star
