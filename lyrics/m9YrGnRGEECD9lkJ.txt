Celtic Frost
To Mega Therion
Dawn Of Megiddo
Humilated in human form/We have to die to be reborn
Awaiting the final judgement/The dawn now lifts
Subjects of flesh/Slaves of lust
The cross has failed/You won't see the coming fall

A diviner's fire and soil
Flames, like flowers, like blood
Fires of freedom, flowers of doom
A surface of hateful hope

(Chorus)
Oh subjects of pain
Lovers of death
You will feel
The yearning flames

Flames like tongues - like cries
Pant for kisses - For bites
Seven steps - And we're one
Humilated - In human thoughts

The frost, it bites/Your inner heart
Frozens the flame/ln every eye
The lord will come/Broken ice
The fire will burn/Gleaming ways

Well never be reborn
Prenatal death's redeemed (our lives)
(Into his hand) we demand our hearts
The lord and we are one
