I've been dodging the question for too long
I see you sitting there
What are you running away from?
How long can you stand on a broken branch
Before it falls
Leaving won't fix your problems

I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one
I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless

You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on 'cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)

You really shouldn't have left here in the first place
We're not are coming back
I set myself up to break down
A broken heart makes you seem weak
And far from feeling happy
(What are you running away from?)

I hate to say I told you so
Turns out I came undone
You're not the only one

You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on 'cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)

Forgetful apologies
Over and over
Forgetful apologies
Over and over

I hate to say I told you so
Turns out we're broken and careless

You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on 'cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
Don't hold on 'cause I'll hold you back
When there's hope in what I say
You always turn away
You'll get by while I get better
(While I get better)
