He turned me down
I then downturned another
Who then downturned her
The paralysing juice of rejection
His veins full of lead
He's left with loving what he lost
More than what he has

My snakeskin, cold in the dark
But warms up in the light
I then upturned a green-eyed giant
Who upturned and entered me

Will we stop seeing what unites us
But only what differs?

The ghosts of old loves
Hovering around his orifices
His orifices

As you narrate your own heart-tale
You thread souls into one beam
The love you gave and have been given
To weave into your own dream
I trust my cells to rearchive
My love historic stream
