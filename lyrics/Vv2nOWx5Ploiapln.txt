Something about you, oh, oh

You'd never see me cry
But I've done it
Maybe it's all a lie
But who doesn't?

Has been a year since you left and I stay
Time is moving, getting goes just one way

Could be holding me back
But I can't change the past
You made me so cold
So I'll let you know

I can't seem to forget about you
I, maybe now I'm gonna live without you
Memories are coming down on me
I don't wanna believe that it's the end of the dream
But I just know that there's something about you

Some days I'm not alright
But I fake it
It's one day at a time
And we'll make it

That's just a path we ended up on, baby
Some days are heavy but we're doing okay
(Doing okay)

I can't seem to forget about you
I, maybe now I'm gonna live without you
Memories are coming down on me
I don't wanna believe that it's the end of the dream
But I just know that there's something about you

(Something about you)

We lived, we loved
We kissed on every corner
Then came mistrust
Maybe I should have wondered
Counting down the years
Holding back the tears, oh ho

I can't seem to forget about you
I, maybe now I'm gonna live without you

I can't seem to forget about you
I, maybe now I'm gonna live without you
Memories are coming down on me
I don't wanna believe that it's the end of the dream
But I just know that there's something about you

Just know that there's something about you
Just know that there's something about you
