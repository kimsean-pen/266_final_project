Saturation

I feel that wheels are turning 'round
Replay
We made you what you were
We brought them up that hill
We brought them up to roll them down
In the morning, light must clean you out
I'm sad that time escapes me
It pushes ahead of me all day
Remind me what I could have been
I feel the faster I'm going
The more I am slowing down
I'm the focus of the bring down
I'm the one who captures what he lost
And turns it around
