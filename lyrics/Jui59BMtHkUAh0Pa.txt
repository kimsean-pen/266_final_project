Lately I've been feelin' kinda heavy
Could it be all the baggage I'm carrying
I had a guy who wasn't right
Talk about love and I gotta think twice

I mean, he really worked a number
Up in my mind when I was open
Not just my lover was my best friend
But he stole my heart and kept runnin'

It's either love or life I want it all
But sometimes I may not get all the calls
Will you pick me up baby when I fall?
Keep me safe in your arms

I know, I might be movin' slow
We can pick it up later down the road
It's a bit difficult to give you control
But let's see where it goes

'Cause I've been lied to cheated on
But you can make it right
If you can come and save me, save me
So won't you come and save me, save me?

I can't trust, the truth be told
But you can make it right
If you can come and save me, save me
I'll let you come save me, save me

So far my life has been crazy
Like a reality show but baby
Can you take the drama out my life?
Make me forget all the tears that I've cried

Oh, I think I better warn ya
What you see ain't just what you gon' get
Pieces of me ain't right, they're still left
Can you pull them together, yeah?

It's either love or life I want it all
But sometimes I may not get all the calls
Will you pick me up baby when I fall?
Keep me safe in your arms

I know, I might be movin' slow
We can pick it up later down the road
It's a bit difficult to give you control
But let's see where it goes

'Cause I've been lied to cheated on
But you can make it right
If you can come and save me, save me
So won't you come and save me, save me?

I can't trust, the truth be told
But you can make it right
If you can come and save me, save me
I'll let you come save me, save me

I was trapped within my pain
Not long ago
It's still hard
But I try to do the best I can

Understand if
My heart breaks again
It's already done, it's over
'Cause I know my heart will never mend

But you can make it right
You're gonna make it right

I've been lied to cheated on
You can make it right
If you can come and save me, save me
So won't you come and save me, save me

I can't trust, the truth be told
But you can make it right
If you can come and save me, save me
I'll let you come save me, save me

I've been lied to cheated on
You can make it right
If you can come and save me, save me
Save me, save me

I can't trust, the truth be told
But you can make it right
If you can come and save me, save me
I'll let you come save me, save me

Your love is saving me
