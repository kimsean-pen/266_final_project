When we talk about the future
You've got your arms wrapped around my waist
Lets not talk about the future
No
Tonight is just another day

I can't take you serious
I'm serious
It's your birthday
And you're acting all mysterious
So concerned about your future
Yeah
But tomorrow is just another day

Don't cry
Don't cry
I'm alright
Oh its all gonna be alright
Yeah

We were summer late bloomers
Fumbling through our teen age
We used to talk about our future
Remember when we couldn't wait

I can't take you serious
I'm serious
It's your party and you're still in bed
You won't get dressed
I can't take you serious
Are you serious?

Don't cry
Don't cry
I'm alright
Oh it's all gonna be alright, yeah

Years go by whether you want them to
Years go by whether you want them to
Years go by whether you want them to
Years go by whether you want them to

Put on your makeup
I laid out your favorite sweater
It's just a number
Darling, dry your eyes

Don't cry
Don't cry
I'm alright
Oh it's all gonna be alright, yeah
