Feels like I waited on you for how long?
I don't know
Oh, it's not like me to wait on someone for so long
Yeah, I know

Oh babe, I'm backwards and I don't feel good
Oh, you can go run away
I am backwards and I feel stupid
I'm watching you back away

I just wanted more from you
And what did you do?
I opened the door for you
And we couldn't move

And you could be the bad guy, I could be the bad guy
Anyway you wanna try, doesn't make us feel right
It's funny like that
And we can talk all night, get into another fight
Tell me all our lies, didn't mean to make me cry
What a way to react

Maybe next time we can work this out
But my head and heart are tangled up for now

You know that I'm backwards
And I don't feel good
Oh, you can go run away
I am backwards and I feel stupid
I'm watching you back away

I just wanted more from you
And what did you do?
I opened the door for you
And we couldn't move

And you could be the bad guy, I could be the bad guy
Anyway you wanna try, doesn't make us feel right
It's funny like that
And we can talk all night, get into another fight
Tell me all our lies, didn't mean to make me cry
What a way to react

But you never really wanted to talk anyway
You never really wanted to talk anyway
You never really wanted to talk anyway
You never really wanted to talk anyway

Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Oh, where did you go?
