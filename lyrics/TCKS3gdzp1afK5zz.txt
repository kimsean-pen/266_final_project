Everywhere the sun is shinin'
All around the world it's shinin'
But cold winds blow across your mind

Confusion, it's such a terrible shame
Confusion, you don't know what you're sayin'
You've lost your love and you just can't carry on
You feel there's no one there for you to lean on
To lean on

Every night you're out there, darlin'
You're always out there runnin'
And I see that lost look in your eyes

Confusion, I don't know what I should do
Confusion, I leave it all up to you
You've lost your love and you just can't carry on
You feel there's no one there for you to lean on
To lean on

Dark is the road you wander
And as you stand there under
The starry sky, you feel sad inside

Confusion, you know, it's drivin' me wild
Confusion, it comes as no big surprise
You've lost your love and you just can't carry on
You feel there's no one there for you to lean on
To lean on

Confusion, confusion
Confusion, confusion
Confusion, confusion
Confusion, confusion
