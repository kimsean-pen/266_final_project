She's been sorting you out, a flower bouquet
Picks 'em straight from the ground
It's good dead anyway
Your favourite colors, and 2D lovers
You've been keeping clean
Living off plant feed, and fertiliser
This one's a fighter
Although I can see
This isn't healthy
You can see why this should stop
But I know this too well
And I just can't tell
When enough is enough
Enough, the feeling is tough
Tough every time
You walk out the door
You're packing your stuff
Stuff is looking so rough
Rough but so cool
Why you leaving me for?
What you leaving me for?
Why you leaving?
She's been lost at sea
'Til he swam down to the coral reef
And what surprised her
They looked just like ya'
Although I can see
This isn't healthy
You can see why this should stop
But I know this too well
And I just can't tell
When enough is enough
Enough, the feeling is tough
Tough every time
You walk out the door
You're packing your stuff
Stuff is looking so rough
Rough but so cool
Why you leaving me for?
It's never enough
Enough, the feeling is tough
Tough every time
You walk out the door
You're packing your stuff
Stuff is looking so rough
Rough but so cool
Why you leaving me for?
What you leaving me for?
I won't eat
I won't sleep
I get weak, and that's when I take it
There's no point in saving
I won't eat
I won't sleep
I get weak, and that's when I take it
There's no point in saving
Why you leaving?
Why you leaving?
Why you leaving, oh?
Why you leaving?
Why you leaving?
