Should I keep myself ravenous to you?
And I feel myself surviving you
I lose, I lose my head

All around me
I keep moving, everybody changes
If I'll have to leave tonight
Will it ever be the same again?

Will it ever be the same again?

There are pictures in my kind of view again
Today
If I'll lose them I will die with you
Believe
That I could wait

All around me
I keep moving, everybody changes
If I'll have to leave tonight
Will it ever be the same again?

Will it ever be the same again?

All around me
I keep moving, everybody changes
If I'll have to leave tonight
Will it ever be the same again?

Will it ever be the same again?
