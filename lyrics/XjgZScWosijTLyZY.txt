It's this perfect harmony
That tires me so endlessy

Its the hurt inside of me
Makes me see the light in me

It's the perfect colour that bleeds
Twisted into the tapestry

It's the way you laugh at me
When i'm too blind to see

If i was high
I could be a flame
I would bend the sky
And set the world on fire
If i was high
I would blow you away
