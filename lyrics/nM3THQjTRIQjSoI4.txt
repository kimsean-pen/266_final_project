New fang, no thang
Had it made to parade
Found a sucker
Now I want another

Stand up
Step aside
Open wide
Hanging out and on
Until the feelings gone

Want to?
Yes I do
Wanna learn
Taking turns
Getting carpet burns

Loose lips
Lipstick spit
Come or go
I think its both i gotta know

Sometimes you break a finger on the other hand
Think you've got me confused for a better man
Sometimes you break the finger on the other hand
Say you've got me confused

I ain't a better man

No slack
Cadillac
Couldn't quit
Gums flap so
Here's your teeth back

Accept
What i left
Far behind
In a time
When my mind was like a landmine

Tailgate
By the lake
Too much, too young
Every button gonna come undone

Tightrope
No joke
Nothing left so you go broke

Sometimes you break a finger on the other hand
Said you've got me confused for a better man
Sometimes you break the finger on the other hand
I know you got me confused

Don't go, oh no

New fang pressing down low
No more waiting around for

New fang pressing down
No more waiting around

New fang
New fang
They gonna wait? No

New fang
New
They gonna wait no more
