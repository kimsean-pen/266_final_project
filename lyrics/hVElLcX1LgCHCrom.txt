Sick of all these things I tried
Sick of all these lies
Nobody cares, you're just a bad man
Nobody wants you, you're a dead man
Wake me from my darkest dream
Read me from my mind
Nobody cares, you're just a bad man
Nobody wants you, you're a dead man
No problem, I've got time to kill
Nobody cares, you're just a bad man
Nobody wants you, you're a dead man
Save everyone, I've had my fill
Nobody cares, you're just a bad man
Nobody wants you, you're a dead man

Do what you say, do what you want to
Do what you say, do what you want to
Do what you say, do what you want to
Do what you say, do what you want to

We rip apart the flesh and live to see
And look at all the faces along the way
The terror grips me close and holds me tight
And hope I get to die yet another night

Throw a wrench into my world
Throw me in the fire
Nobody cares, you're just a bad man
Nobody wants you, you're a dead man
Death come over to me one time
We shouldn't get much higher
Nobody cares, you're just a bad man
Nobody wants you, you're a dead man
No problem, I've got time to kill
Nobody cares, you're just a bad man
Nobody wants you, you're a dead man
Save everyone, I've got my fill
Nobody cares, you're just a bad man
Nobody wants you, you're a dead man

Do what you say, do what you want to
Do what you say, do what you want to
Do what you say, do what you want to
Do what you say, do what you want to

We rip apart the flesh and live to see
And look at all the faces along the way
The terror grips me close and holds me tight
And hope I get to die yet another night

Don't get close to me, safe for you
All this suffering left to do
Don't get close to me, safe for you
All this suffering left to do
All this suffering left to do
All this suffering left to do

We rip apart the flesh and live to see
And look at all the faces along the way
The terror grips me close and holds me tight
And hope I get to die yet another night
We rip apart the flesh and live to see
And look at all the faces along the way
The terror grips me close and holds me tight
And hope I get to die yet another night
