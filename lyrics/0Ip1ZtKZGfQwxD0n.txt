No, I can't handle
No, I can't handle it, no
No, I can't handle

Let out the air and sink to the bottom
Where all the weight is forgotten
No one can hear me down here
Came down, a comedown where I don't fear
Somebody seeing my tears
I feel safer down here

But I'm sinking deeper
I'm sinking deeper
I'm sinking deeper
Than I ever thought I would go

Too many times that I've been
Too proud to let it out
(When I feel it's too much to handle)
Too many times that I've been
Too proud to let it out

And then I start to get nervous
What if I never resurface?
No one can hear me down here
The pressure gets worse the further I fall
The dimmer the light, the lower I go
And I'm getting cold

But I'm sinking deeper
I'm sinking deeper
I'm sinking deeper
Than I ever thought I would go

Too many times that I've been
Too proud to let it out
(When I feel it's too much to handle)
Too many times that I've been
Too proud to let it out

No, I can't handle
No, I can't handle it, no
No, I can't handle
Can you hear me down here?
No, I can't handle
No, I can't handle it, no
I think I'm safer down here

Too many times that I've been
Too proud to let it out
(When I feel it's too much to handle)
Too many times that I've been
Too proud to let it out
Too many times that I've been
Too proud to let it out
(When I feel it's too much to handle)
Too many times that I've been
Too proud to let it out
