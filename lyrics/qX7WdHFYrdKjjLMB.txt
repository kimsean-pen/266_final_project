If you could read my mind love,
What a tale my thoughts could tell.
Just like an old time movie,
'bout a ghost from a wishin' well.
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet,
You know that ghost is me.
And I will never be set free,
As long as I'm a ghost, you can't see.

If I could read your mind love,
What a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paperback novel
The kind the drugstores sell
When you reach the part
Where the heartaches come
The hero would be me,
Heroes often fail.
And you won't read that book again

Because the endings just to hard to take.

I'd walk away like a movie star,
Who gets burned in a three way script,
Enter number two,
A movie queen to play the scene of bringing all the good things out in me.
But for now love let's be real
I never thought I could act this way,
And I've got to say that I just don't get it.
I don't know where we went wrong,

But the feelings gone and I just can't get it back.

If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
About a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet the story always ends
If you read between the lines
You'll know that I'm just trying to understand
The feeling that you lack
I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelings gone and I just can't get it back
