I've heard a story, could be true
About a colour under blue
You couldn't see it with your eyes
Or invent with intellect

Like the inverse of colourblindness
It shadows light in natural gas
I've got to see it for myself
Settle my own curiousness

Back and forth screaming like a tide
I look to the left and to the right
My three shades are divisible
Lust to see the invisible

The story man was glassy-eyed
He told me about the power lines
And subarctic caribou eyes
The metal wires bursting to life

They flick across the territory
Resplendent like the sky
Some of the snow absorbs UV
Unseeable crumbs and dye

Picking up clues, bat my eyes
I screw them as the iris of the storm's eye
My three shades are divisible
Lust to see the invisible

Tetrachromacy
See what I can't see
Tetrachromacy
See what I can't see

Polygondwanaland

Inconspicuous you and me
Crown in candle is lost in me
My three shades are divisible
Lust to see the invisible

Tetrachromacy
See what I can't see
Tetrachromacy
See what I can't see
