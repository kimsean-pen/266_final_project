In my rear view
I watch you watching the twilight
Behind the telephone lines
With nothing to prove,
Or to assume
Just thinking that your thoughts
Are different than mine

In my rear view
I watch you
And I gave you your life
But you give me mine
I see you slowly swim away
As the light is leaving town
To a place that I can't be
But there's no apologies

Just go on
Just go on
There're still so many things
I want to say to you
But go on
Just go on
We're bound by blood that's moving
From the moment that we start
From the moment that we start

I see you perfect little eyes
Watch the shadows of the clouds
On the surface of the ocean
Out the window of a plane
I get nervous when I fly
I'm used to walking with my feet
Turbulence is like a sigh
That I can't help but over think

What is the purpose of my life
If it doesn't have to do
With learning to let it go
Live vicariously through you
You could do the same
It's the least you can
Because it's a lonely little chain
If you don't add to it

So go on
Just go on
There's still so many things
I want to say to you
But go on
Just go on
We're bound by blood and love
From the moment that we start

Just go on
Just go on
There're still so many things
I want to say to you
Just go on
Just go on
We're bound by blood that's moving
From the moment that we start
From the moment that we start
