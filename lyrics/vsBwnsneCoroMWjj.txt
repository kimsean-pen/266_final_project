Just like every man is a dog life ain't no simple child
Some men are dogs all the time
I can only try my best just like all the rest
Isn't poetry supposed to rhyme?

Put a hole in my head, my sunshine

I hope you don't have me wrong, I hope you people are strong
Isn't poetry supposed to rhyme?
I can only try my best just like all the rest
Some men are dogs all the time

Put a hole in my head, my sunshine
