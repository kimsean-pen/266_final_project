We hid on a plane
Flying across the sky
Searching for islands where we could land
Too far away to be found
We took off our gloves and danced like if we got mad
Took a dip in the ocean
To wash away all the sand

I'm not alone
Not anymore this time
I found my love

Under a coconut tree
Where we created a universe
Hiding from all of that
Where nothing mattered but you and me
Make it like it used to be
Give me a time machine
With you and I riding on a tree
Only you and me
Under a coconut tree

It's like we designed the anatomy of a tree
As crazy in love as we'd ever be
Inside a fantasy
Under the stars
Floating above the sea
And we were lost like
We always dreamt to be

I'm not alone
I say to myself
I found my home

Under a coconut tree
Where we created a universe
Hiding from all of that
Where nothing mattered but you and me
Oh, make it like it used to be
Give me a time machine
With you and I riding on a tree
Only you and me
Under a coconut tree

Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la

We hid on a plane
Flying across the sky
Searching for islands where we could land
