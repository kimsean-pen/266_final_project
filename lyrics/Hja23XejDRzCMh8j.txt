I want you to rock with me baby
Rock me baby all night long
I want you to rock with me baby
Rock me baby all night long
I want you to rock with me baby
Rock me baby all night long
I want you to rock with me baby
Rock me baby all night long

I got to get myself a future shock
Rocking in the sky, I just can't stop
Feel me, I've got sensations just for you
I'm stepping off the world tonight
I'm going down in disco lights
Feel me, I've got persuasions
Got sensations

Can I get another dance with you?
Is there nothing I can do
To get another dance with you?
Can I take you to another block?
(Superfresh, baby)
Where the music never seems to stop
(Superfresh lady)
I'd do anything it's true
(Superfresh)
To get another dance with you
(Superfresh, maybe)

I'm master blasted in the streets of gold
I wanna do this till we both get old
Feel me, I've got sensations just for you
I'm gonna put your loving to the test
I always knew that you were superfresh
Baby I've got persuasions
Got sensations

Can I get another dance with you?
Is there nothing I can do
To get another dance with you?
Can I take you to another block?
(Superfresh, baby)
Where the music never seems to stop
(Superfresh lady)
I'd do anything it's true
(Superfresh)
To get another dance with you

I want you to rock with me baby
Rock me baby all night long
I want you to rock with me baby
Rock me baby all night long
(She's so superfresh)

I want you to rock with me baby
Rock me baby all night long
(Do it with me, do it with me, do it with me)
I want you to rock with me baby
Rock me baby all night long
(All night long)

(Can I get another dance?)
You know there's nothing I like more than you next to me
(Get another dance with you?)
(Can I get another dance?)
You know you got me so high, I'm in so much ecstasy
(Get another dance with you?)
Can I get another dance?
Get another dance with you?
Is there nothing I can do, to get another dance with you?
