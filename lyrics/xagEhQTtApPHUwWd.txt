it's so convincing how you breathe down my neck
i'm back to you like i'm so sure that the ego side is my best
and i'm back to honor that
and you keep riding all on me it's like that
pummel me it's like that
so convinced that i'm dead
body wet
i'm over feeling bad for you like i'm spent
body's like i'm mad at you but still in love with that attitude
it's back to you
i do what i have to do
it's my debt
felt yr mouth on my neck
on yr knees for my set

meet me on the other side...
put me in pain...
it takes from my body
i still miss you baby...
