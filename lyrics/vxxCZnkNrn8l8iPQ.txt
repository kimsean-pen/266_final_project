you mistrusted what will bleed
what will not die will not leave
the heart was first in that line
though it was under those conditions
we were free (x3)
under those conditions
of pain that would not leave
you were all i ever trusted
you're self made (x3)
you made it on hard work and risk
hard work (x3)
how will i live without you
without your customs
of working and thinking action through
these days are obvious to you, budgetive
how selfish for time to conclude
what would be the day
for leaving to work it's charm on you
and i can tell by that look
you were thingking the same thing to
if this can't last just what can last (x2)
then it's lights out after this kiss (x2)
then time can't torment us (x2)
this will have to serve (x3)
goodnight lover (x2)
wherever you are (x3)
