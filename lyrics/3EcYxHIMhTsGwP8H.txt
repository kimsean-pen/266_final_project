Chorus:
Nemecic, Nemecic, come born! Come born, darkness child!
Nemecic, Nemecic, last bust! Last bust, the holy rite!
(repeat)

(repeat chorus x1)

Is this the land where sun brightly shines?
Is this the existence of a heaven's sign?
Is this the locus, the hallowed focus?
Where grace, love and harmony combine?
Is this the stead where reigns the light?
Is this where hate bids?
Hear those souls' cries: Do they beg? Do they smile?
Do they follow the endless long line?
Nemecic for the anxious heavy spirit!

(repeat chorus)

Lay down their souls with holy fears,
And waters the ground with dismal tears.
Soldiers of grief prepare, we are near,
Fight the pash with shields but without spears.
Hold by the whispers that summer breeze bears,
And reign the land where all the woes bear.
Hear those souls' cries: Do they beg? Do they smile?
Do they follow the endless long line?
Nemecic for the generation free!

(repeat chorus)
