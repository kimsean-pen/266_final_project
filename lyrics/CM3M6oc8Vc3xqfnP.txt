Show your palms to everyone
It's who you are, do you believe in destiny?
It's left its mark, a brutal scar it's who you are
Do you read the sky at night? Those lights will fade like you and I
And everything you've ever seen will slowly go on disappearing
So keep on breathing
Fate doesn't know you but fate she only knows your name
And chance is a tricker and luck is looking up again
Fate doesn't know you but fate she only knows your name
And chance is a tricker and luck is looking up again
Fate doesn't know you but fate she only knows your name
And chance is a tricker and luck is looking up again
Fate doesn't know you but fate she only knows your name
And chance is a tricker and luck is looking up again
You are born under a sign
The stars aligned a different kind of
Destiny has left its mark
Newspaper talking it's who you are
Every time I read a line
I throw myself a head in time and trip up on the warning signs
But I choose not to let it read true
So keep on dreaming
Yeah
Fate doesn't know you but fate she only knows your name
And chance is a tricker and luck is looking up again
Fate doesn't know you but fate she only knows your name
And chance is a tricker, tricker, tricker, tricker!
Show your palms to everyone
It's who you are
Do you believe in destiny?
It's left its mark
A brutal scar it's who you are
Fate doesn't know you but fate she only knows your name
And chance is a tricker and luck is looking up again
Fate doesn't know you but fate she only knows your name
And chance is a tricker and luck is looking up again
Fate doesn't know you but fate she only knows your name
And chance is a tricker and luck is looking up again
Fate doesn't know you but fate she only knows your name
And chance is a tricker and luck is looking up again
