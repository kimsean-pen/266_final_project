Every cell is always pushing me but my decision comes so slow
To satisfy another vibe and not just my ego
Cos all this overthinking's got me thinking on how we go from us to strangers
Can I overcome myself and make putting you first second nature

Born to be dead to me

The waters run deep underneath me, I'm waiting for him patiently
Confront my feelings every day, do I deserve you or am I just meant to drift away

Time and time again I cut you out before we settle in
Too much of a coward to keep you close as a friend
Into my skin bores a failure that lingers
Wipe clean the blood as I pick at the splinter

How selfish I seem

The waters run deep underneath me, I'm waiting for her patiently
Confront my feelings every day, do I deserve you or am I just meant to drift away

Another shallow grave, another chance to fuck this up, an emotional dead end to add to the cycle
It never ends, and win or lose it's just another time, another way and I can't take this anymore
