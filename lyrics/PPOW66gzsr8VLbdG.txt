Tell me why? Tell me who?
Tell me you don't know what to do
Get it all over you
Who won't know how to fight? Only you

Tell me why? Tell me who?
Tell me you don't know what to do
Get it all over you
Who will know how to fight? Only you

You're with me (You always)
Another time (Can't touch me!)
I don't care (I won't care)
If it's wrong or right (I'll just lie)
You'll reach in (You always do)
And I'll reach out (Can't touch me!)
Time will tell what we're all about
