Old cruel road
It never ends
Tearing down
Every defense

It leaves me
Worthless
Wandering
I've lost my way so many times
From first breath
To final rest
I find the path always unwinds

My sunken hopes
Are buried deep
A revelation
Just beyond my reach

And thus
My journey's brought me home again
It's not what it used to be
Faded tracks recall my origins
And rekindle memories
Forsake that which
I worshipped then
A whole life in effigy
Set foot on the cruel road again
And pray this time will not leave me

Wordless
The constant sting
A future I will never know
Forgotten loves
Left bitter tastes
They died before a chance to grow

Those days alone
Fractured beliefs
Left tattered scraps
Of former peace

Cannot
Let
The old times
Be my captor
The curse
Upon
My life
Must be shattered
Seize
Control
And slough
Away
The shackles
And tread
The world
Unbowed
Until my body collapses

On the cruel road
