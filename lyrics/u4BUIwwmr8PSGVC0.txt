I watch you from across the lake
Where the waters remain forever still
I watch you from across the lake
Where the waters remain forever still

And I collapse to the bank still green
And scream hoarse with the whisper of the leaves
And you were bountiful then and I asked you why
Small, frail, dependent, I

Should have to watch you walk from the shoreline, grey
You smiled something about life and something about time
Something about the winding length of mine
How I'd be ready when it came to that day

But I am not
And every nerve recoils at the thought
That the vessels still remain but are with nought

A light switched off
A stopped clock
A loss
A light switched off
A stopped clock and a loss

Death, take me home
Death, take me home

The cloak flaps blackly
My fingers map the lines
Across the writing on your monuments
I ponder the winding
Of life and death and time

And I hope to God the next passage on the waiting raft is mine
Please don't leave me here between life and death and time

Please don't leave me here
Please don't leave me here
Please don't leave me here
Please don't leave me here

Death, take me to the lake where the waters remain forever still
