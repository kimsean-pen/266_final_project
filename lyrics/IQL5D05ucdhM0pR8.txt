Stormtrooper

A storm is approaching
And another tower falls
The battles here go on forever
Can they justify the emptiness
There is a man in the picture
Mourning until the end
There is no meaning left
Nothing to defend

Will you ever find a place
A place to be alone?
When even your memory
Won't let you be at home?

It's just a photograph
Waiting for another day
Relieve me of my command
Make it go away

Memories of the disenchanted
Adrenalin sends you into darkness
This picture is screaming
Just to be alive
