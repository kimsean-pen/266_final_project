Summer's been fine
Winter's around the corner
Autumn's in the way
No one tried to warn her

Talk to me
Tell me all the things that you wanted to, but you couldn't say
Now we have so much time, but we're running out of breath
And the one thing on my mind is your face behind my back

Judging by your face
The most anyone's cried today
Air conditioning blocks out everything

Talk to me
Tell me all the things that you wanted to, but you couldn't say
Now we have so much time, but we're running out of breath
And the one thing on my mind is your face behind my back
And the one thing on my mind is your face behind my back
