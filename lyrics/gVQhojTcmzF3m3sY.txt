It's for the curious and it's for the hopeful
Kick in the doors and climb in the window
Kick in the doors and climb in the window
Oh because it's midnight service at The Mutter Museum
Oh it's midnight service and I'm glad
I'm glad that you're here

Better luck better luck at the poll tax
That's what I that's what I thought too
You're better off not trying too hard
Well that's what I that's what I thought too

But now it's midnight service at The Mutter Museum
Oh it's midnight service and I'm glad
I'm glad that you're here

I'm glad that you're here
