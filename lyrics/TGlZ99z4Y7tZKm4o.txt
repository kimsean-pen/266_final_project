Beware the serpents in the leaves and their deception
An outstretched hate closed to a fist
Becomes a weapon
I see the damage they have done
I see the battle's just begun
I know the answer lies inside
I feel it when I close my eyes

Through disaster and decay
Survive to fight another day
When there's no time for you to question, every single step you take
Press on, and trust in your instincts
Trust in your instincts

Break down the barriers of fear and superstition.
Listen to your primal past and intuition
You'll see the damage they have done
You'll see the war is never won
You'll know the answer lies inside
You'll feel it when you close your eyes

Through disaster and decay
Survive to fight another day
When there's no time for you to question, every single step you take
Press on, and trust in your instincts

Kill or be killed, (stand and fight)
Sink or swim, (run and hide)
The answer lies within

Through disaster and decay
Survive to fight another day
When there's no time for you to question, every single step you take
Press on, and trust in your instincts
