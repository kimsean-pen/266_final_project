When it came to pass,
loaded, pass me by
Fate, with a single blow,
has clustered by me now
True, I had my chance,
true, true, true I had those wild charms for you
Oh, oh...
My fire burned them out
But we will not be moved by it
We will not be moved by it

Your mind would never ache,
when you were young and sound
The way your heart aches now,
you feel you sent them onto ground

Love, love, love til you got enough,
dance, dance, dance, if you got no love around you Love,
love, love, til' you got enough,
dance, dance, dance, til' there's noone left to hound you
We will not be moved by it
We will not be moved by it

Oh, oh...
Love, love, love til you got enough,
dance, dance, dance, if you got no love around you Love,
love, love, til you got enough,
dance, dance, dance, til' there's noone left to hound you
We, we will not be moved by it
We will not be moved by it
We will not be moved by it
We will not be moved by it
