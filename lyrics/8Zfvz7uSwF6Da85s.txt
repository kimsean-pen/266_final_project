The past is dead
I walk the funeral march, and I will make my peace
The past is dead
I walk the funeral march, and I will make my peace

If we stop the clock, will I reappear?
Pulled from the drift, there goes another year
The stars align, the planets shift
All the infinite moments that we've missed
There's parts of me that are lost forever
At least we're all lost together
We all remember youth like it's dead and gone
Like our favourite line from a forgotten song

I'll show you my hurt, and I'll show you my heart
A life lost in the dark

The past is dead
I walk the funeral march, and I will make my peace
The past is dead
I walk the funeral march, and I will make my peace

When I reach the end, will I beg for more?
Will I look back or step through the door?
I stand beneath a monolith
Do you ever feel like you won't be missed?
There's parts of me that are lost forever
At least we're all lost together
I heard that this was only a ride
So there's no worth in waiting for death to arrive

All we are is just a name, it's all we are
Our skin, it shows these crippled bones, youth sinks alone
All we are is just a name, it's who we are
Our skin, it shows these crippled bones, youth sinks alone
I'll show you my hurt, and I'll show you my heart
A life lost in the dark

There's parts of me that are lost forever
At least we're all lost together, oh
There's parts of me that are lost forever
