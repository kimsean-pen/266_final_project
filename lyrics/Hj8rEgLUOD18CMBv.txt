A black day dawn at horizon
Where winter hearts our battlefields

The ultimate frost age desire
Oh snowflurry drifts these plains

Since the blast of primaries
We've conquered against the storm

Throning with will
And the sound of battle never ends

Tragedies blows at horizon
We ride as one
Tragedies blows at horizon
Our battle rages on

Tragedies blows at horizon
We ride as one
Tragedies blows at horizon
Our battle rages on

Thundering columns of fire
Majestic against the breeze

Gleaming my sceptre at hand
The wind altogether silent

Frozen of heart
Awaken from a time and risen

By the dying evening breeze
The sound of battle never ends

Tragedies blows at horizon
We ride as one
Tragedies blows at horizon
Our battle rages on

Tragedies blows at horizon
We ride as one
Tragedies blows at horizon
Our battle rages on
