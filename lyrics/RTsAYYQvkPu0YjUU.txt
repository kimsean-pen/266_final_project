The world is quiet
Like there's no one around
But I feel you beside me
I know the secrets
You keep locked away inside
Don't understand why you're fighting

I know, she must be special
This new girl by your side
I seek the answers
When I look into your eyes
And it hurts like hell but I will be strong

For once in your life
Be a man
Just tell me the words
'Cause I know that you can
Don't leave me with scars
That no one can heal
For once in your life - be a man

You made me love you
Love you right from the start
You're controlling my heart, babe
Don't pack your bags yet
Give me time to say goodbye
(Say goodbye)
Just don't leave me wounded

Now
I just hope you will regret the things you do
Come back to me
'Cause our love is the real thing
And and it hurts like hell but I will be strong

For once in your life
Be a man
Just tell me the words
'Cause I know that you can
Don't leave me with scars
That no one can heal
For once in your life - be a man

I knew that I
I fought to keep our love strong
If you leave me now
You come running back for more, babe
And I hope for
And I wish for
And I pray
That the words from your mouth can
Eventually make you a man

For once in your life
Be a man
When everything stops
...for a minute in your life
I'll hope that

For once in your life
Be a man
Just tell me the words
'Cause I know that you can
Don't leave me with scars
That no one can heal
For once in your life - be a man

Be a man
Tell me the words

Once in your life

Be a man
Tell me the words
