You're broken, so am I
I'm better off alone
No one to turn to
And nothing to call my own

Outspoken, so am I
Explosive words that your world
Wouldn't understand
Turn away again

You're beaten, so am I
I've got a heart of stone
No medication can cure
What has taken hold

You're hurting, so am I
When I awaken, remember why
I've been running from your

World
Dishonored by your world
Your world
I'm haunted by your world

My blood is cold as ice
Or so I have been told
Show no emotion
And it can destroy your soul

Another sacrifice
To a tormentor your world
Wouldn't understand
Turn away again

You're angered, so am I
A thousand fires burn
A land of darkness
From which I cannot return

You're aching, so am I
When I awaken, discover that
I've been damaged by your

World
Dishonored by your world
Your world
I'm haunted by your world

Remember and you might be welcomed
Amongst the heartless monsters you surround yourself with
Feeding off the pain and misfortune of others
A maniacal unit of sub-human parasites
Warped into a feeding frenzy at the smell of fresh blood

Open your eyes and see the creatures for what they are
A swirling mess of hatred and envy
Don't be naive enough to think you're unaffected
The conversion has already begun
You're frightened, so am I
A world of demons wait
Watching the movements
And filling my heart with hate
You're burning, so am I
When I awaken, discover how
I've been ravaged by your
World
Dishonored by your world
Your world
I'm haunted by your world
