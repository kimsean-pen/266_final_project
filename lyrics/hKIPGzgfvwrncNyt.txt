One devotion to an empty moment.
Can you stay tonight?
Silence broken with words unspoken.
Now she's on her knees

No more feeling so useless.
"Can I beg for one more?" she said.
Taking with arms wide open.
Longing for sleep again.

The air is clearing.
Again, we're breathing.
Water turns to wine.
The day is tired,
The night's inside her.
Now she is alive.

No more feeling so useless.
"Can I beg for one more?" she said.
Taking with arms wide open.
Longing for sleep again.

But now, I'm awake...
But now, I'm awake...
But now, I'm awake...

Keep breathing, to feel something.
Take my breath...

(Away!) I PRAY THE SILENCE WILL STOP AND TAKE MY BREATH AWAY!
(Away!) SHE PRAYS THE SILENCE WILL STOP AND TAKE HER BREATH AWAY!
(Away!) I PRAY THE SILENCE WILL STOP AND TAKE MY BREATH AWAY!
(Away!) SHE PRAYS THE SILENCE WILL STOP AND TAKE HER BREATH AWAY!

Feeling so useless.
"Can I beg for one more?" she said.
Taking with arms WIDE open.
LONGING for sleep again.

But now, I'm awake... (I'M AWAKE...)
But now, I'm awake... (I'M AWAKE...)
But now, I'm awake... (I'M AWAKE...)
But now, I'm awake...
