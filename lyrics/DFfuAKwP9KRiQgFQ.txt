Crying loud, you are crawling on the floor
Just a beautiful baby
You're nothing more
Close your eyes
You are crawling into sleep

I swear I won't break you
If you let me take you
Where the willows never weep
Where the willows never weep

Coming quick into your wonderland
Flying high on bleached white sand
Tranquilized by lights
You'll lose your way

Well just come with me
And I'll make you see
With me you'll want to stay
Can baby come out to play

Down you're going
Down you're going
Down you're going
Down

Circus lights are shutting slowly down
But still you're up in the air
And loving your wings
My dear, you play the clown

You're still up in the air
And loving your wings
What's gonna happen when you come down
