I wish i could go out with you tonight
Without wanting to burn everyone in sight
I want to share my feelings but it's hard
'Cause i haven't my whole life

I'm tired of being tired
But you don't seem to be bothered
When i stay in bed all day

I guess i'm kinda sorry
'Cause i won't go to your party
But you tell me it's okay

'Cause i fucking hate
Everyone but you

I wish i didn't say those things that night
I promise that i didn't want for us to fight

I'm tired of being tired
But you don't seem to be bothered
When i stay in bed all day

I guess i'm kinda sorry
'Cause i won't go to your party
But you tell me it's okay

'Cause i fucking hate
Everyone but you
