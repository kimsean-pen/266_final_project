Seven years of hard luck, comin' down on me
From the Florida border, yeah it's up to Nashville Tennessee
I worked in every joint you can name, mister every honky tonk
Along come Mr. Yankee Slicker, said' "Maybe you're what I want"

Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin' for MCA

9,000 dollars, that's all we could win
But we smiled at the Yankee Slicker with a big ol' Southern grin
They're gonna take me out to California gonna make me a superstar
Just pay me all of my money, mister maybe you won't get a scar

Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin' for MCA

Slickers took my money, since I was 17
If it ain't no pencil pusher, it got to be a honkytonk queen
But I'll sign my contract baby, and I won't you people to know
Every penny that I make, I've gotta see where my money goes

Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin' for MCA
