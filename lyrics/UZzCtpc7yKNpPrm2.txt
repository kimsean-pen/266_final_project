You, you and me, me and you
We will always be
Take out two
Me and you

'Cause all those other things
Superfluous, goddamn
Superfluous, goddamn
When it was never really meant to be
You and me

You have me around and in tears
As always rainmaker

Rainmaker, you make me weep
Rainmaker, you make me weep
It was never really meant to be
You and me

I can hardly stand
I can hardly sleep
I can hardly speak
I can hardly breath

It was never really meant to be
You and me

I want you to be happy
You're the rainmaker
I can hardly stand
I can hardly sleep
It was never really meant to be
You and me

I can hardly stand
I can hardly sleep
I can hardly speak
I can hardly breath

It was never really meant to be
You and me

You and me, me and you
We will always be
The take out two
Me and you

I can hardly stand
I can hardly sleep
I can hardly stand
I can hardly sleep

It was never really meant to be
You and me
