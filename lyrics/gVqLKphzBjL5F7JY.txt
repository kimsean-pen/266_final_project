We have no future
Heaven wasn't made for me
We burn ourselves to Hell
As fast as it can be
I wish that I could be a King
Then I'd know that I am not alone

Maggots put on shirts
Sell each others shit
Sometimes I feel so worthless
Sometimes I feel discarded
I wish that I was good enough
Then I'd know that I am not alone

Death is policeman
Death is the priest
Death is the stereo
Death is a T.V
Death is the tarot
Death is an angel
Death is our God
Killing us all

She puts the seeds in me
Plant this dying tree
She's a burning string
And I'm just the ashes

She puts the seeds in me
Plant this dying tree
She's a burning string
And I'm just the ashes
She puts the seeds in me
Plant this dying tree
She's a burning string
