I hear the sky is falling here we are, on empty
I feel my heart is turning black tonight, safely
If all we are is dust and shades of gray
How I wanted to say
Are we all alone, 'cause I'm empty?

Until the fire that blinded who we are in silence
Will take a picture let it breathe alright, remind less

All with words and affection in your eyes
I'm taking off my disguise
Were you all alone, 'cause I'm empty?
Are you empty? Are you empty tonight?

Now kiss me one last time
And bring me back to life, bring me back to life
Now kiss me one last time
And bring me back to life, bring me back to life

I know the sky is falling here we are, I'm empty
I feel the world keeps spinning, am I high? Safely

If all we are is dust and shades of gray
And how I wanted to say
Are you all alone, 'cause I'm empty?
Are you empty? Are you empty, tonight?
All I fear tonight

(Well, the fiction gets through the night)
Sky is falling
(The fiction will get through the night)
Sky is falling

(Well, the fiction gets through the night)
Sky is falling
(The fiction will get through the night)
Sky is falling

(Well, the fiction gets through the night)
Sky is falling
(The fiction will get through the night)
Sky is falling
