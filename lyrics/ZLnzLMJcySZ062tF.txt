Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to throw it down

Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to throw it down
It's a ratatatatt on the nucleus of your brain cell
Came to rock the funky joint so I might as well
Get on the one and have some fun
And drop a break in the barrel of my shotgun
There's a boom like a bolt of lightning through my shotgun

I pass the mic to you 'cause I like to
Back on a mission and ready to ride
If we don't get you now I'm gonna get you on the b-side
Coming at you live Monophonic lo-fi
We're cutting up rugs where the beats will never die
Get in to win it no matter how skin it
No holdin' back loading breaks to the finish
Boom like a bolt of lightning goes through my shotgun

I pass the mic to you cause I like to
Back on a mission are you ready to ride?
If we dont get you now gonna get you on the b-side
My mission is to invade your mind

And you better believe you're gonna like my kind
Strange voices in my head
Freedom is what they said Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to go

Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to throw it down
Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to throw it down
It's a ratatatatt on the nucleus of your brain cell
Came to rock the funky joint so I might as well
Get on the one and have some fun

And drop a break in the barrel of my shotgun
There's a boom like a bolt of lightning goes my shotgun
I pass the mic to cause I like to
Back on a mission and ready to ride
If we don't get you now I'm gonna get you on the b-side
Coming at you live Monophonic lo-fi
We're cutting up rugs where the beats will never die
Get in it to win it no matter how skin it

No holdin' back loading breaks to the finish
Boom like a bolt of lightning goes my shotgun
I pass the mic to you cause I like to
Back on a mission and ready to ride

If we dont get you now gonna get you on the b-side
My mission is to invade your mind
And you better believe you're gonna like my kind
Strange voices in my head

Freedom is what they said Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to throw it down
Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to go
Back on a mission and ready to throw it down
