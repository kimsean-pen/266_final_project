Lamps and tables
Books and chairs
Spinning fans and silverware
Coffee maker
Cups and glasses
Nosy neighbors
Whisper Passing

Everything must go
You know I tried
Everything must go
I know it's hard to say goodbye

Frames and pictures
Hand me downs
Trucker caps and a wedding gown
Vinyl albums
Record player
Boxes marked "handle with care"

Everything must go
You know I tried
Everything must go
I know it's hard to say goodbye
But it don't matter
As long as you're mine
Let go, let's fly

Everything must go
I know it's hard to say goodbye
But it don't matter
As long as you're mine
Our home is
The road, the sky
Everything must go
Let go, let's fly
Everything must go
