As a matter of fact,
There's no turning back
Though I can't deny,
I still want you back
No confidence, just hide and seek
Your weapon's blood, is security

What about promises,
And what about the days I'm missing
What about, what about, what about us
What about the time of our lives
What about the things that you had
What about, what about, what about us

I'm waiting for you ... x4

I'm waiting
It's time to let go

I'm waiting for you
What about, what about, what about us ... x2

As a matter of fact,
There's no turning back
Though I can't deny,
I still want you back
No confidence, just hide and seek
Your weapon's blood, is security
What about promises,
And what about the days I'm missing
What about, what about, what about us

I'm waiting for you ... x2
What about, what about, what about us ... x2

As a matter of fact,
There's no turning back
Though I can't deny,
I still want you back
No confidence, just hide and seek
Your weapon's blood, is security
What about promises,
And what about the days I'm missing
What about, what about, what about us

What about the time of our lives
What about the th√Øngs that you had
What about, what about, what about us
