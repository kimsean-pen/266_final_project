There've been times in my life
I've been wondering why
Still somehow I believed we'd always survive
Now I'm not so sure your waiting here
One good reason to try
What more can I say

(this is it)

(you know...)
Comes a day in every life

(this is it)
One way or another
(this is it)
No one can tell what the future holds (this is it)
Your back's to the corner
(this is it)
You make the choice of how it goes (this is it)
The waiting is over
(this is it)
No one can tell what the future holds (this is it)
You're going no further
(this is it)
You make the
