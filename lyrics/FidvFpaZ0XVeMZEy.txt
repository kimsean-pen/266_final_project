Sleep in the fire, in thorns and decay
Dreams and desires they have all been a waste
I'm getting closer, so close to awake
So close to what life's been, yet still so far away

Dancing through days...
Where the pain ascend in a thousand ways
Dancing through nights...
Where the darkness strikes me from inside
Dancing through life...
Where it's strife enshrines all my desires
Dancing through death...
A dance with the devil and a flirt with the dead

Leaving the fire, abandon the flames
Lost in denial, all your life's been in vain
Life growing colder, it's closing in on you
I know you're going down, but there's no more I can do

Dancing through days...
Where the pain ascend in a thousand ways
Dancing through nights...
Where the darkness strikes me from inside
Dancing through life...
Where it's strife enshrines all my desires
Dancing through death...
A dance with the devil and a flirt with the dead

Calm me down
To the sound
Of my insanity
Voices screaming
Astral dreaming
A mental symphony...

Dancing through days...
Where the pain ascend in a thousand ways
Dancing through nights...
Where the darkness strikes me from inside
Dancing through life...
Where it's strife enshrines all my desires
Dancing through death...
A dance with the devil and a flirt with the dead
