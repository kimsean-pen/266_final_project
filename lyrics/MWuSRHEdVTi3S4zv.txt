Oh, I love this house, I love this house
Gives me the greatest peace I've ever known
Oh, I love to hear those conkers fall
Smash 'em on an Southwark stone

And I love that here you live with me
Gives me the greatest peace I've ever known
'Cause I've been too long a lonely man
Yes, I've been too long a rolling stone

So let seasons turn
Grow paradise garden
And to my migration
The native has returned

Oh, I love the curling of your hair
Gives me the greatest peace I've ever known
I see Dylan Thomas in your face
Recited Butler Yeats there in your grace
Your grace, your grace

So let seasons turn
Grow paradise garden
And to my migration
The native has returned

Returned
Returned

And if I had to die today
Scatter my ashes on this place
And I live on in your grieving heart
But until that day that we depart

Oh, this is the greatest peace I've ever known
Oh, the greatest peace I've ever known
Oh, the greatest peace I've ever known
Only love makes house a home

Home
Home
Home
This house is home
