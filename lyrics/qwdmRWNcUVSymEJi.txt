Ah, bitch (ha ha ha)
Baby Talk 5, fuck a nigga mean nigga
Fuck you talkin' 'bout (yeah yeah yeah)

I'm on they ass today
I just went and picked me up a bag today
I pulled up on the scene with a bad lil bae
She got a fat ass, when I smash it shake
Smackin' her ass, playin' patty cake
Shut the fuck up, do what daddy say
I think I got lil baby mad at me
Fucked up her ass, she look bad today

Told her hop in the whip, we can go get a fix
I'ma drop that bitch off at my set, she the shit
As soon as she done with that nappy ass hair
You can pick up your boy to come pick up his bitch (damn)
Look at my wrist that's a brick
I just fucked up my Rolex but fuck it, it's lit (damn)
I don't give a fuck 'bout no fame and no chain
Ain't no jewelry put me on the lick (damn)
I just went sat with the label (huh?)
Niggas offered me a contract (what happened?)
Told them niggas I ain't want it (why?)
The shit was whack, I didn't sign that (uh)
I'm the best but never mind that (okay)
My shit so hard that they rewind that (ah)
Got that work if you can't find that (huh?)
You can't afford it, we can finance
I got one foot in the trap,
got one foot up they ass, ditch your coat on the rack
Got my dick in your bitch,
she be bendin' it over and bustin' it open and throwin' it back
I'm tryna go fuck a bunny
Fuck all these hoes 'cause they don't really love me
I'm tryna get me some motherfuckin' money
If they free Meek Mill why they ain't free my cousin?
I bet we shoot up your motherfuckin' party
If somebody touch me or one of my brothers
I bet that none of these niggas that talk
on the internet try me, they see me in public
I bet they play all my motherfuckin' teachin'
Bitch I don't rap, I be motherfuckin' preachin'
I bet you paid for that motherfuckin' show
And I bet you paid for that motherfuckin' feature (bitch)

I'm on they ass today
I just went and picked me up a bag today
I pulled up on the scene with a bad lil bae
She got a fat ass, when I smash it shake
Smackin' her ass, playin' patty cake
Shut the fuck up, do what daddy say
I think I got lil baby mad at me
Fuck it, let's go to the bank

I'm 'bout to motherfuckin' blank
My name hold weight, I got motherfuckin' rank
I'm in the rental with my brother Thank
We tryna eat, where our motherfuckin' plate? (ha)
It's been there with me, y'all just motherfuckin' late
I need that shit now, I can't motherfuckin' wait
I bet you act like you motherfuckin' know
I put this four-five in your motherfuckin' face, bitch

I'm on they ass today
I just went and picked me up a bag today
I pulled up on the scene with a bad lil bae
She got a fat ass, when I smash it shakes
Smackin' her ass, playin' patty cake
Shut the fuck up, do what daddy say
I think I got lil baby mad at me
