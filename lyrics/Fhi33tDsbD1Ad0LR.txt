Nobody knows how long
Rustling leaves unrhyme
Lullaby breeze unsung
Babel of dreams unwinds in memory
As bad, as bad becomes
It's not a part of you
And love is only sleeping
Wrapped in neglect
Time it's time to live
Time it's time to live through the pain
Time it's time to live, now that it's all over
Time it's time to live
Time it's time to live through the pain
Now that it's over, now that it's over
Kissing a gray garden
Shadow and shade
Sunlight treads softly
As bad as bad becomes
It's not a part of you
Contempt is ever breeding
Trapped in itself
Time it's time to live
Time it's time to live through the pain
Time it's time to live, now that it's all over
Time it's time to live
Time it's time to live through the pain
Now that it's over, now that it's over, now that it's over
As bad as bad becomes
It's not a part of you
The wicked and the weeping
Ramble or run
Time it's time to live
Time it's time to live for living
Time it's time to live, now that it's all over
Time it's time to live
Time it's time to live for living
Time it's time to live, now that it's all over
Now that it's over, now that it's over
Now that it's over, now that it's over
Rest your head
