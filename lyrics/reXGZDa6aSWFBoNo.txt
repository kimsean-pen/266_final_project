Ah-ah, ah-ah

I spend all my days
Trying to forget her face
She's so hard to erase
I don't think she can be replaced

She stole my heart and ran away
Left me with some things to say
I don't understand

She stole my heart and ran away
Left me with some things to say
I don't understand

I spend all my days
Thinking of her embrace
The way it slowly changed
Some things will never fade

She stole my heart and ran away
Left me with some things to say
I don't understand

She stole my heart and ran away
Left me with some things to say
I don't understand
