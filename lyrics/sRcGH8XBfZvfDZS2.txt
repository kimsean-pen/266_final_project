There she goes
There she goes again
Racing through my brain
And I just can't contain
This feelin' that remains
There she blows
There she blows again
Pulsing through my vein
And I just can't contain
This feelin' that remains
There she goes
There she goes again
She calls my name, pulls my train
No one else could heal my pain
But I just can't contain
This feelin' that remains
There she goes
There she goes again
Chasing down my lane
And I just can't contain
This feelin' that remains
There she goes
There she goes
There she goes
