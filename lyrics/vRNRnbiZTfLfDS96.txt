I can tell you're all alone, even when you're with me
Tell me when the feeling's gone, I believe it's true
It might be hard to mend
It's not so hard to tell me what you're going through
You got to understand, knowing what to do

I can see you're working for people when you're busy
There's not a use in saying that it breaks your heart in two
I won't stay in the way
If it breaks your heart again
I can't blame if it's true

You've got to saving up all of your money
There's not a use in saying that it breaks your heart in two
But you, you, you, you
You got the world to say
But it's true

It might be hard to mend
It's not so hard to tell me what you're going through
You've got to understand, knowing what to do
