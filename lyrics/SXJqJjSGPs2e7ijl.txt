Be still - I want you to listen - it's all so silly
Our ways have somewhere on the way surrendered
Adjusted to the game and the dream is slightly shattered
Guess the answer was never meant to be found
And when the search is over
Our questions still remain

Enlighten me - I wanna see - how this could be the age of reason
won't you tell me - can't you tell me
Cause I need to know
It's in my head it's in my soul
The fire burns and my heart is sold
To the melody and the music - yeah

Please wake up - I want you to see, it could be so pretty
Why do you turn a blind eye
When you know you live a lie

Enlighten me - I wanna see - how this could be the age of reason
Won't you help me - can't you help me
I need to read between the lines
It's in my head it's in my soul
I'm on fire and my heart is old
Like the melody and the music, yeah

Enlighten me - I wanna see - how this could be the age of reason
Won't you tell me - can you tell me
Why we don't read between the lines
It's in my head it's in my soul
A world on fire - the story's told
In the melody and the music

I wanna see - how could it be the age of reason
Won't you help me - I gotta know
It's in my head it's in my soul
A fire burns and my heart is sold
In the melody of the music
