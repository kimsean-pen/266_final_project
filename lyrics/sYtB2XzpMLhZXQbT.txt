If I sell my soul to the devil
I'm the devil, got the devil in me
If I give my heart to the devil
I'm the devil, got the devil in me
If I share my body with the devil
I'm the devil, got the devil in me
If I say I'm in love with the devil
As high as I can be

Come devil to me

I've got the devil in my arms
I've got the devil in my head

Babe, I've got the blues so bad
Eu vendi minha alma pra saber que o diabo sou eu
