Shake the dust out of your head
Its quiet now
And we can hear ourselves
What do we have to do today
What do we have to do
Think about the things
We couldn't live without
If I empty out my mind
Will I leave my soul behind
All that I see
Comes from insides me
Breathe into the flame
And watch it grow to what you can't contain
Graceful for chaos
Chaos
Sleeping in the rain
A bottle to survive
Drives you insane
And then you drift off
Visions
For weeks you
Let me paint in love some light
We're awake now
Can we go outside
Will I ever finish what I make
Can I ever love what I create
Maybe not this year
Maybe not this life
Breathe into the flame
And watch it grow to what you can't contain
Graceful for chaos
Chaos
Sleeping in the rain
A bottle to survive
Drives you insane
And then you drift off
Visions
For weeks you
