And it begins a new
The hatred of mankind
As it seeks to kill
That which lives inside

Now we are dying
Dying the slowest death
Held down by bonds that bind us
We breathe our final breath

And it begins a new
The burning we endure
As we seek the strength
Strength to break the bonds

Now we are dying (Dying)
Dying the slowest death
No more condemnation
We fight for our last breath

Breathe life
For you are not alone
Breathe life
Inside your heart of stone

From dust
Your were born
And to the ashes you return
From dust
Your were born
And to the ashes you return

Break the bonds
Break the bonds

Breathe life
For you are not alone
Breathe life
Inside your heart of stone (Breathe in life)

Breathe life
For you are not alone (Breathe life, breathe in life)
Breathe life
Inside your heart of stone.
