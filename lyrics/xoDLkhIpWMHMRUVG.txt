Voodoo chute
Why don't you tie the lewis
From circus through to senseless way
Rhythm healer is your force to feed her
Let me inside of your gauge
And turn on nice and slowly
You don't even know me
Come closer to the knife
I'm seeking out truth within my heart
Was filled of sin, oh, a lot of virtuous sacrifice

And there's a natural mystik in the air
And darling you're looking at me with that lust in stare
Are you really, do you feel, and are you really there?

And there's a natural mystik in the air
And darling you are looking at me with that lust in stare
Are you really, do you feel, and are you really there? Are ya there?

Voodoo go now, I ask for your direction
Please put your hands up in the air where I can see them
I see I'm surviving myself and I'm drowning in my dreaming, hm
I forgot my peace when I knew it was there
Lonesome wandering soul of the earth my heart was bare
I kiss the ground and I know I was never found
I guess I need my ego to rest

There's a natural mystik in the air
And darling you are looking at me with that lust in stare
Are you really, do you feel, and are you really there?

And there's a natural mystik in the air
And darling you are looking at me with that lust in stare
Are you really, do you feel, and are you really there? Are ya there?
