I'm not free but who wants to be
You're everything that's right for me
I'm not free but who wants to be
You're everything that's right for me
I'll never run to someone new
I belong to you
(All the same)
I'm... free but who wants to be
You're everything that's right for me
I'll never run to someone new
I belong to you
