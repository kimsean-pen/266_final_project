I lay my head between the watermelons
Could it ever be any better
Fruit punch love, high as Eiffel Tower
Lay me down now in bed of flowers

There's a place with rainbow filled eyes
I call it home, yeah
'Cause she's my drug, the only kind I'm needin'
I am fiendin', she got me fiendin'

You win some, you lose some
Why all the boys get them some
I get down like dim sum
Baby I can love who I like
Peaches and mangoes
My love goes where wind blows
Steamin' up these windows
'Cause we can love whoever we like

And I think you're the one for me
I never had this kind of lover, yeah yeah
And when I bring this one home
They ain't gonna be like the others
So bring your lips and bring them close
Oh we are not illegal
Mama you want what's good for me
Dontcha? Well she is

Like fruit
Like fruit
Like fruit but Betta
Like fruit
Like fruit
Like fruit but Betta

I'm sorry, I will never fit in
I'll never fit in
I'll never fit in
But I know love, for the real meaning
The real meaning
Is not called sinning

Lord if you open your gates
Maybe I'll come home, yeah
There's no rules in my kind of heaven
Only feelings
Can you feel it?

You win some, you lose some
Why all the boys get them some
I get down like dim sum
Baby I can love who I like
Peaches and mangoes
My love goes where wind blows
Steamin' up these windows
'Cause we can love whoever we like

And I think you're the one for me
I never had this kind of lover, yeah yeah
And when I bring this one home
They ain't gonna be like the others
So bring your lips and bring them close
Oh we are not illegal
Mama you want what's good for me
Dontcha? Well she is

Like fruit
Like fruit
Like fruit but Betta
Like fruit
Like fruit
Like fruit but Betta
Like fruit
Like fruit
Like fruit but Betta
Like fruit
Like fruit
Like fruit but Betta

And I think you're the one for me
I never had this kind of lover, yeah yeah
And when I bring this one home
They ain't gonna be like the others
So bring your lips and bring them close
