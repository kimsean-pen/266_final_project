There was never a chance to get away
when was it only ever but perverse
why could they take a stone and break your arms
there could be nothing worse
except to live

Live, live little girl
sold in slavery
twenty-five men
have their way in you
burned upon the breast
with a cigarette
nothing is worse than to be born and live

There was someone at home you cared about
when was there anyone who cared for you
why could they take a spoon and break your teeth
there could be nothing worse
except to live

Live, live blighted girl
sold in slavery
twenty-five men
have their way in you
burned upon the foot
with a cigarette
nothing is worse than to be born again

Earth has lost and lost its youth
tomorrow, tomorrow will be no happy days
you will die and die and falkland road
your ashes will reek of sweat
