It's hard letting go
I'm finally at peace, but it feels wrong
Slow I'm getting up
My hands and feet are weaker than before

And you are folded on the bed
Where I rest my head
There's nothing I can see
Darkness becomes me

But I'm already there
I'm already there
Wherever there is you
I will be there too

...
There's nothing that I'd take back
But it's hard to say there's nothing I regret
Cause when I sing, you shout
I breath out loud
You bleed, we crawl like animals

But when it's over, I'm still awake
A thousand silhouettes
Dancing on my chest
No matter where I sleep

You are haunting me
But I'm already there
I'm already there
Wherever there is you

I will be there too
But I'm already there
I'm already there
Wherever there is you

I will be there too
...
Cause I'm already there
I'm already there
Wherever there is you
I will be there too
I'm already there
I'm already there
Wherever there is you
I will be there too
