I can't believe that we burned through this whole pack of cigarettes
I swear to God there is nothing to do in this town
Maybe we'll find out that we're just not made for each other
Hell I don't care you're the best thing that I've never found

Sooner or later we end up as fragile compartments
Tired of carrying a soul that is so far from home
I never said that I'm scared of eventually dying
My only fear is I might have to do it alone

Wherever you go
I will find you
I will find you Angela

Sometimes at night I can still hear you laying beside him
Whispering about all the hurt that you're leaving behind
They tell me Jesus can fix all the ones who need healing
Wonder if you'll think of me when you open your eyes

Wherever you go
I will find you
I will find you Angela

Wherever you go
I will find you
I will find you Angela
Angela
Angela
Angela
Angela
Angela
Angela
