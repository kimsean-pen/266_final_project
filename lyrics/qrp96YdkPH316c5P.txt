Hello, my honey
My beautiful friend
It's hard to imagine
It's come to an end but
The more I remember
The more I forget
Living in fear of what hasn't come yet

And the angels are calling
They're shot to the heart
Ominous frictions
Will tear us apart
And the villains of sorrow
Will always remain
Follow the future in silence and pain

No tears to cry
All that hurt
Or leave tonight

All my hurt

Oh the angels are calling
They're shot to the heart
Ominous frictions
Will tear us apart
And the villains of sorrow

Will always remain
Follow the future in silence and pain

No tears to cry
In all that hurt
Or leave tonight
Before I turn
My babe, your bleed fills my heart
Or leave tonight
All my hurt
