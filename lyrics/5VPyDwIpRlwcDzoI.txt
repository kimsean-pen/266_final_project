About the time that I turned 14
I got a job doing landscaping
Those days were long and my old boss was mean
About the time that I turned 16
I got a car and no place to be
I'd fill up the tank and drive out to the sea
The Rockies ain't too far from here if we drive all night
The cold air will do you well in the mountain morning light
So let's ride
Let's ride on through the rain
Come on and take me anywhere that you want to be
So let's ride
By the time that I turned 19
I'd seen so much and I was still green
It's taken me a time or two
To learn the things I watch you do for me
There I was at 29
I can't believe I'm still alive
Though it was never easy, yeah
You and me were born to survive
The Rockies ain't too far from here if we drive all night
The cold air will do you well in the mountain morning light
So let's ride
That was my escape
A way to change the tape
That was playing, that was playing in my head
The Rockies ain't too far from here if we drive all night
The cold air will do you well in the mountain morning light
So let's ride
Let's ride on through the rain
Come on and take me anywhere that you want to be
Let's ride, let's ride
Let's follow the skyline
And when we make it to the other side
We'll find all the bluest skies
