You're gonna leave
It ain't gonna break my heart, mama
I never see nobody quite like you
And if you ever change your tune
Oh, the world's got the best of you
You can always find me where the skies are blue
Wanting to change, turning to what you love, mama
And I would have gave all of my best to you
So, if you ever need a fool
Who will give you a love so true
You can always find me where the skies are blue
Let your dreams little darlin' in a flower bed
Let that sunshine in your hair
In you hair
You're gonna bleed somebody's brand new love, mama
Who's gonna feel you like it always do
And when your fairytale is through
And you're looking for someone new
You can always find me where the skies are blue
You can always find me where the skies are blue
