When I was younger I caught a glimpse of fate,
Above the water, flickering,
So lonely it seemed, so fragile was its beam,
In storm waters, threatening,

Churning tides keep me awake,
While I'm still asleep,
Can't take my eyes off the failing light,
That floats upon the sea,
But I won't die, it isn't my time,
Here is a part of me,
Up on the deck, 'neath the failing light
Sinking into the sea

There in the darkness, I felt it was too late,
I saw my father swept away,
Just like my lover, who sipped beneath the sheets,
Into the water, rippling

Under the light that keeps me awake,
Call out to the sea,
That takes me in and holds me tight,
But I cannot breathe,
If the fates align, it isn't my time,
More than a part of me,
Under the deck, submerged in the night,
Carried away in the stream silently.
