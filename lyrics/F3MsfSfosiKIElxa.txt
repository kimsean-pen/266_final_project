Get inside, into my house
I know that you've plenty left to figure out
But I am sure
Hesitation at the door
Don't leave me with reservations on the floor
I need much more
Listen to my careful words
See through them, and signal to me that you heard
What I can't say
Tangled up inside my head
I need to shake it loose, try to forget
Why you're away
