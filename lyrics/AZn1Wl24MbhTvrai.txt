As I awake to the black
Unbleached detecting cells
Regenerate no adapting to the
Darkness I must sleep
I can hear sounds of
The tools metal on metal
Testing for a proper incision
The smell of a hospital
Lingers in the air
A foreign tongue a language
I do not know but I
Can hear the laughter
Bound in this chair my
Last memories are close

Remnants of torture
Remnants of torture

When will I wake consciousness
Of lucid dreaming I can feel the
Metal as my mouth fills with blood
When will I wake
When will I wake consciousness
Of lucid dreaming I can feel the
Metal as my mouth fills with blood
When will I wake

Above my carrion I peer down
Below to knowing now I am gone
A victim of the sick
I hed to the afterlife for retribution
Above my carrion I peer down
Below to knowing now I am gone
A victim of the sick
I hed to the afterlife for retribution

Remnants of the tortured I sleep
Remnants of the torture a permanent dream
Remnants of the tortured I sleep
Remnants of the torture a permanent dream

Pain while dreaming - now i see again
To unmask this execution from
The nether realm
Pain while dreaming - now i see again
To unmask this execution from
The nether realm

Putrefaction denied my soul no sleep
Purgatory I lye waiting to ruin
Putrefaction denied my soul no sleep
Purgatory I lye waiting to ruin
