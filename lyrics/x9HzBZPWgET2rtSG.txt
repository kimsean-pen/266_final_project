First things first, I admit it
It's hard for me to admit what I'm feeling
Something about you
I don't know what it is but I know that I'm ready for us
You got me so, can't give you up
Can't get out
I don't know what it is but I know that I'm ready for
Ups and downs, in and out, runnin' rounds, but you got me baby
When I'm a mess I got no stress 'cause you got me baby
Oh, you got me baby

'Cause I'm right here next to you,
We ain't got nothing to do
I want to be your only one
After tonight I gotta be your only one
After tonight
And the girls keep watching us
You see a poster and try to touch
Baby, I know they want what we've got, but it's only for us
They want what we've got, but it's only for us

Oh oh, I want relationship goals, relationship goals with you
Oh oh, I want relationship goals, relationship goals with you
Oh oh, I want relationship goals, relationship goals with you
Yeah, with you.

What we've got right here, we love the most
Boy this is much more than mystic grand poster???
I don't know what it is but I know that I'm ready for
Ups and downs, in and out, runnin' rounds, but you got me baby
When I'm a mess I got no stress 'cause you got me baby
Oh, you got me baby

'Cause I'm right here next to you,
We ain't got nothing to do
I want to be your only one
After tonight I gotta be your only one
After tonight
And the girls keep watching us
They see a poster and try to touch
Baby, I know they want what we've got, but it's only for us
They want what we've got, but it's only for us

Oh oh, I want relationship goals, relationship goals with you
Oh oh, I want relationship goals, relationship goals with you
Oh oh, I want relationship goals, relationship goals with you
Yeah, with you.
