I've got this feeling when you're smiling
It's not the same thing when you're crying I still
Enjoy too well, I got it, don't think too much about it
I love to see you when you're smiling
I long to be up on your life
I'll wait it till you can decide

It's not (?) after you be free (?) soaring
There's so much more for you to see soaring
