You know the rules, you all know the game
Try to do what's right
And I swear, I can't complain
If I die tonight

But I don't think it's in the stars
For me to go that way
I'll be here for a long, long time, babe
I'm here to stay

I was born to rock 'n' roll
Everything I need
I was born with the hammer down
I was built for speed

Bet your life it ain't no easy money
But you won't hear me bitch
Spent a long time wrecked and funny
Got the ten year itch

See me running all around the world
Trying to make some time
A million miles, a million girls
A million real good times

I was born to rock 'n' roll
Everything I need
I was born with the hammer down
I was built for speed
That's right

Don't you listen to a single word
Against rock 'n' roll
The new religion, the electric church
The only way to go

I don't give a good goddamn
My life's been alright
I'm going crazy, out of my mind
Every single night

I was born to rock 'n' roll
Everything I need
I was born with the hammer down
I was built for speed

I was born to rock 'n' roll
Everything I need
I was born with the hammer down
I was built for speed
