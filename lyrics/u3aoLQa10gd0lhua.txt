Think of all the time time time
You get to know it
Think about the world I found spinning awry
Remember all the clothes I wore to hide it from you
You said let's take the long walk home tonight

Think of all the falling down and hiding under
Think of all the time time time time time
Think of all the hours I spent in constant reflection
Well it gets you down but, it don't make it right
I made it my personal intervention
What a waste of time time time time time

I got a feeling I, I can't get over
Maybe all we had has always been right
Think of all the love you gain when you send it over
Think of all the wool I've spun to be here tonight
Think of all the time time time time time
Think of all the time time time time time
