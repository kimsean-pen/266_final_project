Holding my breath I gaze away
Nothing much, hide and seek, killing time
Higher than clouds so far away
Lazy stones fall down fast
Fools start to sing about love

Biting my nails I look to chase into the screen
Flickers like joy or rage, doubt in charge, I see tails

Crossing those countless waves of tongues spit off
Slipping through the diffusive field of eyes unleashed
I dive into the gap of chaos bread
I shall reach out the deceit of foxes surrounding me to outwit

(Catch out the tails!)
(Catch out the tails!)

Defeating all shuffled doors of pics
Decoding those enormous walls of words built up
I dive into the gap of chaos bread
I shall reach out the seeds of foxes spread around me to outfox

Breathing a sigh I look away
Nothing much, empty space at a loss
Saving my last word in my mind
Wish it were a secret spell
Doubt in hope, killing guide, I feel tails

Crossing those countless waves of tongues spit off
Slipping through the diffusive field of eyes unleashed
I dive into the gap of chaos bread
I shall reach out the deceit of foxes surrounding me

Digits fall on me, lay thick on my sight
Digits fall on me, lay thick on my mind
Digits fall on me, lay thick on my sight
Digits fall on me, lay thick on my mind
So I go, 3-0 D0 3-0 A4, 3-0 D0 3-0 A4, 3-0 3-0 3-0 A4, 3-0 3-0 3-0 A4
3-0 3-0 3-0 3-0 3-0 3-0 3-0 3-0 3-0 3-0
