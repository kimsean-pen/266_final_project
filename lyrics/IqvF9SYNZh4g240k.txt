Oh my, oh my, oh my god
Oh my, oh my, oh my god
Oh my, oh my, oh this guy
I think I like this guy
Oh my, oh my, oh my god
Oh my, oh my, oh my god
Oh my, oh my, oh this guy
I think I like this guy

Another song about the end and not the pick me up again
And not the night I want more friends, but I'm still here
And I don't feel better, look on my bed, where he left a sweater
No amount of drinks, will make me forget it
I thought I'd regret it

Oh my, oh my, oh my god
Oh my, oh my, oh my god
Oh my, oh my, oh this guy
I think I like this guy
Oh my, oh my, oh my god
Oh my, oh my, oh my god
Oh my, oh my, oh this guy
I think I like this guy

All I know is I'm getting older
And my weight is heavy on my shoulder
Got no time for questioning on you no more
Oh, it's like a tug of war
Pushing, pulling, boy you make me work
And you're running, running, I can make it work
Talk about it, we can do better
So why don't you take off your sweater? It's better

Oh my, oh my, oh my god
Oh my, oh my, oh my god
Oh my, oh my, oh this guy
I think I like this guy
Oh my, oh my, oh my god
Oh my, oh my, oh my god
Oh my, oh my, oh this guy
I think I like this guy

I was drunk on my bedroom floor
Thinking 'bout him, thinking 'bout her
I said I don't care, but he's on my mind
Damn I like this guy
