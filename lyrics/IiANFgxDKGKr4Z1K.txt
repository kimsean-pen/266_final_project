My heart gets lost like a message
My head is on the clouds
And I don't get it
And so I'm fashionably numb
Sometimes it helps to forget
Where we come from

Out of the mire we were torn from
Remember
Out of the fire again
But I'm an ember
I hold a banner for you
But it's upside down
You got a question or two
But I'm tongue tied now

Don't try to follow me
I would hold you down if I could
Make you the enemy
I would let you down

Don't try to follow me
I would hold you down if I could
Make you the enemy
I would let you down

I took a ride on the champagne
You took a flight over San Fran Bay
We washed misunderstood
Your heart was warm like a brother's should
But then the gallow gave way
Sometimes they call after you
But you say

Don't try to follow me
I would hold you down if I could
Make you the enemy
I would let you down

Don't try to follow me
I would hold you down if I could
Make you the enemy
I would let you down

I hold you down, I hold you down
I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down
I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down
I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down
I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down
I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down
I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down
I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down
I hold you

Don't try to follow me
I would hold you down if I could
Make you the enemy
I would let you down

Don't try to follow me
I would hold you down if I could
Make you the enemy
I would let you down

I hold you down, I hold you down
I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down
I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down
I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down
I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down
I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down
I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down
I hold you
I hold you down, I hold you down
I hold you
