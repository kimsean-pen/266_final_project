You could be my little dream
I'll read you like a magazine
While we're bored and while we're young
The viewing is easy
But how was I the first to come
To realize what I hadn't done
Something like holding a gun
For something so easy
Oh, my heart stitched love
Used to be in love
But you ran off
Used to getting love
But you ran away
Frozen to the feeling
When you backed up
You took my heart
When you ran away

Mirror this, I'll write your name
Leave a little message too
Eyes are shining diamond blue
Make heaven come closer to you
And when you finally come down
To realize what you hadn't found
Is anything like solid ground
Don't make a sound
Oh, my heart stitched love
Used to be in love
But you ran off
Used to getting love
But you ran away
Frozen to the feeling
When you backed up
You took my heart
And you ran away
Used to be in love
But you ran off
Used to getting love
But you ran away
Frozen to the feeling
When you backed up
You took my heart
When you ran away

Used to be in love
But you ran off
Used to getting love
But you ran away
Frozen to the feeling
When you backed up
You took my heart
When you ran away
Used to be in love
Used to be in love
