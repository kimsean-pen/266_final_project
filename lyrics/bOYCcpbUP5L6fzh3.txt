See, first of all
I know these so called playas wouldn't tell you this
But I'ma be real and say what's on my heart
Let's take this chance and make this love feel relevant
Didn't you know I loved you from the start? Yeah

When I think about
All the years we've put in this relationship
Who knew we'd make it this far?
Then I think about
Where would I be if we were to just fall apart
And I can't stand the thought of losing you

Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger, we might as well do it
Been feeling you all the while girl, I must confess
Girl let's just get married, I just wanna get married

Meet me at the altar in your white dress

Baby, let's get married

Said I done it all
But frankly girl I'm tired of this emptiness
I wanna come home to you and only you
'Cause making love to just anyone ain't happening
I just gotta be with you

Do you think about
Us finishing somethin' we started so long ago?
I wanna give you my all
Do you think about
Maybe us having some babies?
Come on, won't you be my lady, forever? Yeah

I'm ready to
Commit to you
And I just can't wait for that night
'Cause I need you here with me
And let's start a family

Meet me at the altar in your white dress
