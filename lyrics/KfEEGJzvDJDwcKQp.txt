Sunday morning
I was sitting outside
I saw Maggie coming on nowhere to me
She said she tells me she loves me
But I don't know why I'm closing inside
Their dreams are myyy dreams
Mamma tell me wherever she can go-oho
Their dreams are myyy dreams
Mamma tell wherever she can go-oho

Sun (Sunday morning) sun (Sunday morning)
Sun (Sunday morning)

Their dreams are myyyy dreams
Mamma tell me, wherever she can go-oho
Their dreams are myyyy dreams
Mamma tell me, wherever she can go-oho

Sun (Sunday morning) Sun (Sunday morning)
