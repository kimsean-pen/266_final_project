Tell you all my fears
Losing loves and fading years
But I'm still sitting on my tears
They wouldn't go to waste

No matter what you do to turn it down
Know that I want you too to have the sound
All your clocks are slowly counting down
Love will save, love will save us

Watch the world outside
Your memories fade and people die
But I kept dreams alive

No matter what you do to turn it down
Know that I want you too to have the sound
All your clocks are slowly counting down
Love will save us, love will save us

Darkness, night time
Darkness, be mine
Darkness, night time
Darkness, be mine

Under the mountains, worried times
Spent ten years there underground to find
What sparkles in the light
Hotel rooms and taxi cabs
Forgotten memories all we have had
Let me die tonight

Below the stars, you never know
Never know that we're all right
Desperate time, around our telescopes
Beaming me back some light

Don't forget me when I'm gone
'Cause all my diamonds will be shining on

Don't let me die tonight
Don't let me die tonight
Don't let me die tonight
Don't let me die tonight
Don't let me die tonight
Don't let me die tonight
Don't let me die tonight
Don't let me die tonight
Don't let me die tonight
