Heaven sent you
To bring the answer
Heaven sent you
To cure this cancer
For a moment
Unbeatable chance
For a moment
The world in my hands

Like an angel, you came
Every time when I pray
Guardian of my dreams
Watching me when I sleep
Like an angel, you came
Every time when I scream

Time after time I lose again
Night after night I wake up shaking
'Cause my world is breaking
Fool enough to fail again
Night after night I wake up crying
'Cause I feel I'm dying

Still disconnected
And unprotected
Still I'm haunted
That I'm wanted
For a moment
Unbreakable stars
For a moment
You stayed in my arms

Like an angel, you came
Every time when I pray
Guardian of my dreams
Watching me when I sleep
Like an angel, you came
Every time when I scream

Time after time I lose again
Night after night I wake up shaking
'Cause my world is breaking
Fool enough to fail again
Night after night I wake up crying
'Cause I feel I'm dying

Time after time I lose again
Night after night I wake up shaking
'Cause my world is breaking
Fool enough to fail again
Night after night I wake up crying
'Cause I feel I'm dying

Time after time I lose again
Night after night I wake up shaking
'Cause my world is breaking
Fool enough to fail again
(Fool enough to fail again)
Night after night I wake up crying
'Cause I feel I'm dying
