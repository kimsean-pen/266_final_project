Resurrect me from enlightened circles
Crawling, I am undisguised
Disconnect me from this human circus
Searching for the undefined

Every morning is a new beginning
Burning in a sea of cries
Lift em up to meet my execution
Hiding from what I deny

Irreversible, I am on fire
Unenforceable
Take me higher
Irrevocable, I can hear you cry

Wait and see
This is my ecstasy
And I will never abandon this life
(Let go of this life)
Conscience clean
But where's my dignity
Unless the sky's the limit, I fly

Please recess me from the world that's calling
Driven to insanity
Stand corrected you can hear me roaring
Yearning for tranquility

Every story is a brand new era
Face it - I am falling down
Please delete me from the new world order
Screaming from the underground

Irreversible, I am on fire
Unenforceable
Take me higher
Irrevocable, I can hear you cry

Wait and see
This is my ecstasy
And I will never abandon this life
(Let go of this life)
Conscience clean
But where's my dignity
Unless the sky's the limit, I fly

Wait and see
This is my ecstasy
And I will never abandon this life

Wait and see
This is my ecstasy
And I will never abandon this life
(Let go of this life)
Conscience clean
But where's my dignity
Unless the sky's the limit, I fly
