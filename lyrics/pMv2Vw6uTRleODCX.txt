Let's take some time (whispers)
Sip your wine (whispers)
That's it (whispers)
Do you want mines too?(whispers)
Nice (whispers)
Come on (whispers)
Hey, hey
Oh yes,
Oh yeah, ooh
Scream (whispers)
Don't go away baby
Don't go away baby
Hang a while longer darling
If you don't mind, I know
I know darling
If you don't mind darling
Then hang with me baby
Hang with me baby
Take your time (whispers)
Don't go (whispers)

Promise me you'll care for me (whispers)
Promise... that you'll marry me (whispers)
