Sound swells, swirling around in circles
Pulsing, hinting at definition
Murmur traveling down, subconscious
Fathom the depth without any surface

Echoed sounds collide to form an image
Walls vibrate, pushing back, reflexive
Upside down, impulse without closure
Oscillate myopic impressions

Cry out, take in, announce sensation
Revere, relate, draw near, consecrate

Let there be light, light without end

Widen new eyes, sharpen, recognize
React, breathe in, contact kindred skin
