Woah, yeah
Ooh yeah
Everythin' gon' be alright this mornin'

Now when I was young boy, at the age of five
My mother said I'ma be the greatest man alive
But now I'm a man, I make 21
I want you to believe me honey
We're having lots of fun

I'm a man (yeah!)
I spell M, A, child, N
That represents man (yeah!)
No B, O child, Y
That spell mannish boy

I'm a man
I'm a full grown man
I'm a man
I'm a rolling stone
I'm a man
I'm a hoochie coochie man

Sittin' on the outside, just me and my mate
I make the moon
Come up two hours late
Wasn't that a man

I spell M, A child, N
That represents man
No B, O child, Y
That spell mannish boy

I'm a man
I'm a full grown man
I'm a man
I'm a rollin' stone
I'm a man
A full grown man

Oh well
Oh well
