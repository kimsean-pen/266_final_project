Don't start with me baby
I don't know
Don't start with me baby
I don't know
This time I'm taking a long way home

Don't start with me baby
I don't know

Did anybody reach you the most
yeah
It doesn't take a lot to let you bend the rules
yeah

i get excited when you come round
Won't you try to make it right
i know i've been waiting

Don't start with me baby
I don't know

Don't sympathize lately
let it go

This time my heart can't take much more

Don't start with me baby
I don't know
