Put me on a train mama
'Cause things just ain't the same no more
(Put me on a train mama)
Put me on a train my mama

I'm leavin' today
Well, I don't wanna watch the world spinnin'
I wanna be spinnin' with it
(Put me on a train mama)

Well, put me on a train my mama
I'm leavin' today
'Cause I've got the feeling that's for sure

And to know that I can get it makes me want it more
Mama I just want you to know that I'm gonna be fine
Lord I know it's a chance that I take

But I know you'll forgive the mistakes that I make
There's a life out there and it's gonna be mine
Put me on a train mama
'Cause I can't take this pain no more

(Put me on a train mama)
Put me on a train my mama
I'm leaving today
And there's a world that's out there waitin'

And I know that it's a chance I'm takin'
(Put me on a train mama)
Put me on a train my mama

I'm leaving today
'Cause I've got the feeling that's for sure
And to know that I can get it makes me want it more

Mama I just want you to know that I'm gonna be fine
Lord I know it's a chance that I take

But I know you'll forgive the mistakes that I make
There's a life out there and it's gonna be mine
God knows how long I'll be gone
But maybe one day train will bring me home

Put me on a train mama
Ooh, put me on a train mama
Oh, put me on a train mama
I'm leaving today
'Cause I've got the feeling that's for sure
And to know that I can get it makes me want it more
Mama I just want you to know that I'm gonna be fine
Lord I know it's a chance that I take
But I know you'll forgive the mistakes that I make
There's a life out there and it's gonna be mine
Oh, put me on the train
'Cause I'm leavin' today
