I've got to get in sync with you
Do you wanna sync up with me?
Twenty-four bits a night
Is all I need to do it right
Twenty-four clicks per beat
Is all I need to feel the heat
Synchronize our soul
Baby thats how we roll
I'm going to show you how I do it
Do you wanna see how it works?
Specify a main device
Is all I need to synchronize
Fresh off the studio
You can see its signal flow
Never thought it could be
You'd be in sync with me
Plug me in baby
My five-pin DIN is going crazy
Plug me in baby
Gotta plug in the lead
Gonna get the sync I need
dooododoodooododod
doo doo dodod odood
Twenty-four clicks per night
Is all I need to do it right
Twenty-four clicks per beat
Is all I need to feel the heat
Synchronize our soul
Baby that's how we roll
Plug me in baby
My five-pin DIN is going crazy
Plug me in baby
Gonna plug in the lead
Gotta get the sync I need
