I've been watching the man at the bar with his head in his hands, and I think to myself I was just like you.
I can see the returns in your love when its way too much for you, the battles you wear and the armor you choose.
When I first fell in love, in the morning i'd try to remember to say a quite 'thank you'.
And if i rise with the weight in my heart i like to play myself 'a sweet lit old you'.
And I feel those cool rivers washing all, all over me,
And I know these smooth rhythms make me move my feet.
Oh you give me those soul shivers,
Takin me back to the dance,
When music was a life giver,
Make a bad man change his ways.
Cool rivers,
Soul shivers,
I can feel those smooth rhythms,
Make a bad man change, a bad man change his ways.
I've seen men who sleep at the side of the road with a smile upon their face.
I heard old men sing with youth in their voice when that old time record plays.
I seen young boys learnin their first steps to the sound of those drum breaks.
And I heard the sound that accompanies so many fresh mistakes.
Still I feel those cool rivers, washing all, all over me,
And I know these smooth rhythms make me move my feet.
Oh you give me those soul shivers,
Takin me back to the dance,
When music was a life giver,
Make a bad man change his ways.
Oh I'd see those cool rivers,
Soul shivers,
I can feel those smooth rhythms,
Make a bad man change, a bad man change his ways.
