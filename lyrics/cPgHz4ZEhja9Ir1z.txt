This is the triumph of illusion
This is the root of all decay
You can't beat devils with confusion
Reach back and grab what is innate
When a thought begins to thrive
A mask belying lives
All the words escaping from light
I can feel the lies
Behead the devious bettor
Fight your way out of this siege
Deceive the master of delusion
Get ready for inner war
When a thought begins to thrive
A mask belying lives
All the words escaping from light
See the signs
As they rise they will fall
Artifices of the mind that will destroy us
Obtento velo
Verum pellibus
Post mendacium
Try
harder
My head is a tornado
It's a prison, I can't find
Light in all this darkness
I can't find that peace of mind
I think excessively
Therefore i cannot be
Never ending stories
That won't set us free
When a thought begins to thrive
A mask belying lives
All the words scaping from light
Hear the lies
When a thought begins to thrive
Disguising all mankind
A sign of the darkness we light
Feel the lies
When our thoughts begins to thrive
We'll have to overthrow
Our misguided human false pride
Fire!
As they rise we will fall
Artifices of the mind that will destroy us
All is based on false assumptions here
Most of what we know are lies
Thoughts keep writing our tale of life
We'll have to face the truth
Now!
