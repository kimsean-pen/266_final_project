You never saw me, you never did
Though I tried and tried to get you noticed
I think I'll always love you
I just might
One thing I'll gonna love you 'til the day that I die
I wanna get you over
By my side
When you're next to me babe
You can only ever do right
So come on over
To my side
When you're next to me babe
You can only ever do right
That's the sound of a broken heart
That's the sound of a broken heart
That's the sound of a broken heart
Eh, Stop!
You never ever told me
You never do
Though I could see from the look in your eyes that something was troubling you
You say you didn't ever tell me
'Cause there was nothing I could do
Well baby I'm here to tell you that just ain't true
I wanna get you over
By my side
When you're next to me babe
You can only ever do right
So come on over
To my side
When you're next to me babe
You can only ever do right
That's the sound of a broken heart
That's the sound sound sound of broken heart
That's the sound of a broken heart
I think I'll always love you
I just might
I'm gonna try until the day that I die
To get you over
By my side
When you're next to me babe
You can only ever do right
So come on over
To my side
When you're next to me babe
You can only ever do right
That's the sound of a broken heart
That's sound and the sound of a broken heart
That's the sound of a broken heart
That's the sound of a broken heart
That's the sound of a broken heart
That's the sound of a broken heart
That's the sound of a broken heart
That's the sound of a broken heart
That's the sound of a broken heart
That's the sound of a broken heart
That's the sound of a broken heart
