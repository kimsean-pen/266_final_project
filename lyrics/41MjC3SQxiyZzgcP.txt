My mother told me 'fore she passed away
Said, son, when I'm gone, don't forget to pray
'Cause there'll be hard times, hard times, woah, yeah, yeah
Who knows better than I?

Well, I soon found out just what she meant
When I had to pawn my clothes just to pay my rent
Talkin' 'bout hard times, hard times, woah, yeah, yeah
Who knows a little better than I?

I had a woman, Lord, who's always around
But when I lost my money, she put me down
Talkin' 'bout hard times, you know those hard, yeah, Lord
Who knows better than I?

Yeah, Lord, yeah, one of these days
There'll be no more sorrow when I pass away
And no more hard times, I said, no more hard, yeah, Lord
Who knows, hey Lord, better than I?
