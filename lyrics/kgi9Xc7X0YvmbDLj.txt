Days go by, one after another
Out of sight, I'm blamed by the others
Hit the target and here goes nothing
C'mon, run from the past in a circle

I won't back down 'till I'm done
Hear me out and utter none
Now is the moment
I'd better take my chances
Better take my chances now

Never gonna slow down
At least until I pass out
Don't wanna be mean
I'm standing my ground
Whatever comes around

Need someone to talk to
I wish I never met you
Definitely
I'm standing my ground
Whatever comes around

Lemme hear it perseverance
Come over here and lemme gear it
With a lyric before my spirit rises 'bove the limit
Huh

Who's scared to touch the surface?
I'll tell ya now I'm right near it hearin' absurd words
Tryna curve but their attempts are worthless

Have to grab me a gravity gun
Watch 'em fall from their high horses atoppa the sun
Fight back at 'em when they're attackin' for fun
By all means don't back down til you're done

Don't send me astray
Tell hunters I'm not a prey
We've all lost something
Now I'm taking back what's mine
Words are dead to me

I won't back down 'till I'm done!
Hear me out and utter none
Now is the moment
I'd better take my chances
Better take my chances now

Let the rain fall on me
I won't move from here

Never gonna slow down
At least until I pass out
Don't wanna be mean
I'm standing my ground
Whatever comes around

Need someone to talk to
I wish I never met you
Definitely
I'm standing my ground
Whatever comes around

Pretend black is white
Tell liars I'm gonna fight
Try as I may
I don't wanna waste my time
Words are dead to me
