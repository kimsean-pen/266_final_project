I know, you never loved me like I did
You know, I never kid you like you did
You're the beat in my head
Shoot me down and shoot me dead
You're the beat in my head
You're the beat in my head
You shot me down and shot me dead
You're the beat in my head
Bang Bang
Bang Bang
Bang Bang

I know, you never loved me like I did
You know, I never kid you like you did
I know, I didn't leave, I didn't go
You know, you did .?. nothing down low
You're the beat in my head
Shoot me down and shoot me dead
Baby that's what I've said
You're the beat in my head
You shot me down and shot me dead
How the fuck did this happen
Bang Bang
Bang Bang
Bang Bang

You're the beat in my head
You shot me down and shot me dead
How the fuck did this happen
You're the beat in my head
You shot me down and shot me dead
How the fuck did this happen
Bang Bang

She fell in love with a friend
She fell in love with a friend
She made me believe I could wait till the end
She fell in love once again
She fell in love with a friend
I ended upstanding alone hand in hand
I know, you never loved me like I did
You know, you never loved me like I did.
