Never Forget"
And now we're all finding out, how hard it is to lose.
someone you never thought you'd live without.
Where have you gone?
We'll never get the chance.
To let you know how we felt.
To let you know what you meant.
And all the things you lived for.
The show must go on.
The show must go on.
They'll never be another one like you.
We'll never forget.
Moving on, we know that we have to.
You left behind a mourning world.
Now all your love, they sing your songs.
It's in memories, that you'll live on.
Your life wasn't wasn't in vein.
But without you here, nothing's the same.
Now I have the chance.
To tell them what (what) they mean, what I feel.
I can't leave these words unsaid.
Now I have the chance.
To tell them what (what) they mean, what I feel.
I won't leave these words unsaid.
They'll never be another one like you.
We'll never forget.
Moving on, we know that we have to.
You left behind a mourning world.
Now all your love, they sing your songs.
It's in memories, that you'll live on.
I keep replaying everything you said to me.
The stage is everything, these songs mean everything.
I keep rewinding the painful memory.
The day you left us will always haunt me.
They'll never be another one like you.
We'll never forget.
Moving on, we know that we have to.
You left behind a mourning world.
Now all your love, they sing your songs.
It's in memories, that you'll live on.
You'll live on.
You'll live on.
