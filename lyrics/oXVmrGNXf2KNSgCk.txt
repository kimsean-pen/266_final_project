When you leave I knew it was forever
I think it'll make it all better
I cry with depress in my face
I cry my soul in the place
You smell like cheap cigarettes
And we forgot about our beds
Getting drunk in bad taste wine
I put your picture in my golden sky
Freedom is just a name for what I want you to be
Freedom is just a name for what I want you to be
I miss your fresh dumb hair
And you squeezing me like a bear
Your funny accent n the chinese neighborhood
I think I misunderstood
Freedom is just a name for what I want you to be
Freedom is just a name for what I want you to be
Freedom is just a name for what I want you to be
Freedom is just a name for what I want you to be
Freedom is just a name for what I want you to be
Freedom is just a name for what I want you to
be
be
be
be
Freedom is just a name for what I want you to
