Keeping you close, falling behind
I lost my voice, you lost your mind
You say you're not well, I say that you're fine
Walking with me through the aisles of a drugstore

If you return to me, oh, if you return to me

Your mother's a fake, a phantom who steals
The smile on your face is not what you feel
I'll check you in if you check me out
Some lonesome wrist cutter who says I'm her brother

Oh, if you return to me, oh, if you return to me

Was I the ghost or one of your voices
You hear in your head when you're out killing horses?
Who's taking my place, who's taking you home?
I don't think it's safe to turn out the nightlight

And if you return to me, oh, if you return to me

I read your reviews, I studied the lines
I know them so well, my life's now a tragedy
One for the road, two for the plane
And I will be fine, as long as you take me

And if you return to me, oh, if you return to me

It's all right, baby
It's all right, baby
It's all right, babe
It's all right
