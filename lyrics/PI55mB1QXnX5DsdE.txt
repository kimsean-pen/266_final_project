Now I still wonder, why did you say goodbye?
You let me stand here all alone
The pain inside my heart, it's tearin' me apart
'Cause now I stand here on my own

But now I cry myself to sleep
Only you are what I need
We can make it if we try
I am nowhere without you
I don't know what I should do
'Cause my tears will never dry
And I still wonder, why?

I hope that you will see how much you mean to me
I don't understand why you have gone
The pain inside my heart, it's tearin' me apart
'Cause now I stand here on my own

But now I cry myself to sleep
Only you are what I need
We can make it if we try
I am nowhere without you
I don't know what I should do
'Cause my tears will never dry
And I still wonder, why?

It's like the flowers and the bees
Like the mountains and the trees
The love I feel for you baby
Like the desert needs the rain
It will always feel the same
The love I feel for you baby

It's like the flowers and the bees
Like the mountains and the trees
The love I feel for you baby
Like a desert needs the rain
It will always feel the same
The love I feel for you baby

It's like the flowers and the bees
Like the mountains and the trees
The love I feel for you baby
Like the desert needs the rain
It will always feel the same
The love I feel for you baby
