I dreamt i dwelt in marble halls
with vassels and serfs at my side,
and of all who assembled within those walls
that i was the hope and the pride.
i had riches all too great to count
and a high ancestral name.
but i also dreamt which pleased me most
that you loved me still the same,
that you loved me
you loved me still the same,
that you loved me
you loved me still the same.
I dreamt that suitors sought my hand,
that knights upon bended knee
and with vows no maidens heart could withstand,
they pledged their faith to me.
and i dreamt that one of that noble host
came forth my hand to claim.
but i also dreamt which charmed me most
that you loved me still the same
that you loved me
you loved me still the same,
that you loved me
you loved me still the same.
