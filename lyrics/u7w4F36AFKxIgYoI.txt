One, two, three, four

Night time
Out my window
With sad eye[?]on the stereo
Not feeling alright

And life goes
On below
Watch the heat rise
From the barrio
And into my life

Oh turn me on
Don't turn on me
Oh turn me on
Like a bright light in the big city

If you walk a mile
In my shoes
What would you choose?

Thought that I saw Lesra
Sitting on some steps
Thought that I saw Lesra then I wondered what was next
Thought that I saw Lesra she was sitting on a stone
Thought that I saw Lesra she was sitting all alone
Thought that I saw Lesra I got close it wasn't here
Thought that I saw Lesra she looked just like a bird
Thought that I saw Lesra
