I ache, it's opening my soul (my soul).
I ache, it's opening...

Speak what we feel,
and not what we ought to say.
Well, I'm forever young
and you're forever you.

So much to say
but nothing to hide.
Ohh, please open it all.
Soft voice, that whispers lies.
Who do I lay beside?
Soft voice, soft voice,
that whispers lies.

Well, I don't want to see it anymore.
Too bad he's not me and these feelings you just can't ignore.
But I won't be played a fool.
Well, I don't want to see it anymore.
Too bad he's not me and these feelings you just can't ignore.
But I won't be played a fool.

Did you count how many times
the words left my mouth?
So many times I was pressed on top.
You never pushed me off.
As much as it hurts to admit,
you just...

Well, I don't want to see it anymore.
Too bad he's not me and these feelings you just can't ignore.
But I won't be played a fool.
Well, I don't want to see it anymore.
Too bad he's not me and these feelings you just can't ignore.
But I won't be played a fool.

No matter how hard you'll try
These words won't save me
Please stop, slow your speech.
Soft hands that would ruin lives,
and eyes that would burn.
Fall to your knees.

You pretend not to see our problems,
because they form inside you.

Well, I don't want to see it anymore.
Too bad he's not me and these feelings you just can't ignore.
But I won't be played a fool.
Well, I don't want to see it anymore.
Too bad he's not me and these feelings you just can't ignore.
But I won't be played a fool.
