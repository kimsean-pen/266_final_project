Wish I was taking you with me

No more goodbyes,
No more goodbyes,
Tell me to stay home

There's no place
No more goodbyes,
No more goodbyes,
Tell me to stay home

I'm leaving... I'm leaving

No more goodbyes,
No more goodbyes,
Tell me to stay home

I'm leaving... I'm leaving

There's no place
I'm leaving... I'm leaving
There's no place
No more goodbyes

No exotic country
I found my journey's end
When I found you
Don't let me go
Won't leave town
Or go around
If you say so
Won't leave you no if you say so

Can't stay always going away
Never knowing the way home
Another hour
Another day
Surely we
Will find a way somehow

We're leaving the city today
Leaving the city
Soon I will be gone
Leaving the city today
Soon I will be gone

Leaving, leaving, leaving, leaving
No more goodbyes
No more goodbyes
Tell me to stay home
I'm leaving
I'm leaving

No more goodbyes
No more goodbyes
Tell me to stay home
I'm leaving
I'm leaving

There's no place
There's no place
There's no place
There's no place
There's no place

There's no place I'd rather be
Than here dear
If I call you dear, it's because you are

There's no face
I'd rather see
There's no fear
Don't be afraid to say
Stay another day
Then another day

Don't be afraid to say it
Or hold on
Don't you be gone too long baby
Another kiss
One more caress
An ego, no
Another yes

We're leaving the city today
There's something still left here to say

We're leaving the city today
Why can't I get you to ask me stay?
Don't you want to let the music play?

We're leaving the city today
Is there something I've left here to say?
Don't you want to let the music play

Soon I will be gone
I'm leaving
I'm leaving
Don't you want to let the music play?

Soon I will be gone
