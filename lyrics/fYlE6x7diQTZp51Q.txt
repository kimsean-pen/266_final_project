Spitting image of all that is black imagery
We scream the loudest while saying nothing
The spiting image of anonymity
Who screams the loudest while saying nothing you.

When you terrorize and profit
they will consider it a revolution
That is a very thin line; I'll walk it
A system anarchy might understand

Cause a comfort in being scared when you're the only one who dares
To make the gun smoke black in a white washed town so they know
Cause there's a comfort in being scared when you're the only one who dared
To make the gun smoke black in a white washed town so they know it was me

To be American is to profit and by any means
Yeah money talks but I think it's bluffing
The virtue of a man is so much greater when
When he ain't got shit, ain't got a thing to lose

When you terrorize and profit
they will consider it a revolution
That is a very thin line; I'll walk it
A system anarchy might understand

Cause a comfort in being scared when you're the only one who dares
To make the gun smoke black in a white washed town so they know
Cause there's a comfort in being scared when you're the only one who dared
To make the gun smoke black in a white washed town so they know it was me

So start the fire with me, but don't burn down our precious home
So start the fire with me, but don't burn down our precious home
So with the tools you get to start that fire, don't burn down your home
So with the tools you get to start that fire, don't burn down your home

Cause a comfort in being scared when you're the only one who dares
To make the gun smoke black in a white washed town so they know
Cause there's a comfort in being scared when you're the only one who dared
To make the gun smoke black in a white washed town so they know it was me
