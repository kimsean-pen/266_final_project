She's lost in coma where it's beautiful
Intoxicated from the deep sleep, deep sleep
Do you wonder what it's like
Living in a permanent imagination?
Sleeping to escape reality, but you like it like that

Guilty by design, she's nothing more than fiction

She dreams in digital
'Cause it's better than nothing
Now that control is gone
It seems unreal
She's dreaming in digital
She dreams in digital

And your pixel army can't save you now
My finger's on the kill switch
I remember I used to compose your dreams (control your dreams)
And don't be afraid to expose yourself before I shut you down
You made some changes since the virus caught you sleeping

Guilty by design, she's nothing more than fiction
But she dreams in digital
'Cause it's better than nothing
Now that control is gone
It seems unreal
She's dreaming in digital (dreams in digital)

'Cause it's better than nothing
Now that control is gone
It seems unreal
She's dreaming in digital (dreams in digital)
She dreams in digital

(Dreams in digital)
She dreams in digital

She's guilty by design
'Cause it's better than nothing
Now that control is gone
It seems unreal that she's dreaming in digital

(She's nothing more than fiction)

'Cause it's better than nothing
Now that control is gone
It seems unreal, she's dreaming in digital

(Dreams in digital)
