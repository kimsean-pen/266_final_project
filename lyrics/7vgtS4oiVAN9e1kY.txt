Forward yesterday,
makes me wanna stay
What they said was real,
makes me wanna steal

Livin' under house,
guess I'm livin', I'm a mouse
All's I got is time,
got no meanin', just a rhyme

Take time with a wounded hand,
'cause it likes to heal

Take time with a wounded hand,
"cause I like to steal

Take time with a wounded hand,
'cause it likes to heal

I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be
(This I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray)

Well, I'm half the man I used to be
(This I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray)

Well, I'm half the man I used to be
(This I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray)

Well, I'm half the man I used to be,

half the man I used to be

Feelin' uninspired,
think I'll start a fire
Everybody run,
Bob has got a gun

Think you're kinda neat,
then she tells me I'm a creep
Friends don't mean a thing,
guess I'll leave it up to me

Take time with a wounded hand,
'cause it likes to heal

Take time with a wounded hand,
"cause I like to steal

Take time with a wounded hand,
'cause it likes to heal

I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be
(This I feel as the dawn ... It fades to gray)

Well, I'm half the man I used to be
(This I feel as the dawn ... It fades to gray)

Well, I'm half the man I used to be
(This I feel as the dawn ... It fades to gray)

Well, I'm half the man I used to be,

half the man I used to be

Take time with a wounded hand,
'cause it likes to heal

Take time with a wounded hand,

guess I like to steal

Take time with a wounded hand,
'cause it likes to heal,
I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be
(This I feel as the dawn ... It fades to gray)

Well, I'm half the man I used to be
(This I feel as the dawn ... It fades to gray)

Well, I'm half the man I used to be
(This I feel as the dawn ... It fades to gray)

Well, I'm half the man I used to be,
half the man I used to be,

half the man I used to be
