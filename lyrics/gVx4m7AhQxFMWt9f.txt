If my eyes are the windows to where my soul should be,
Can someone clean them up because my vision's getting foggy,
And I can see:
The anything/everything that I should be.
But I don't wanna be like that,
And bitter doesn't taste so bad.
It tastes like no one will ever love us the way we do.
All wrong,
Tell me, are we all wrong?
I don't wanna think like that.
I don't wanna be like that.
Tell me, are we far gone?
Tell me, will we fall off?
I don't wanna think like that.
I don't wanna be like that.
If the grass was green enough but dull in my life,
Would I even make a move or even try to give myself a chance to switch up sides?
I'm settling and wrestling,
But I'm over these.
'Cause I don't wanna feel so mad,
I'd never let it get that bad,
To feel like no one will ever love us the way that I do.
All wrong,
Tell me, are we all wrong?
I don't wanna think like that.
I don't wanna be like that.
Tell me, are we far gone?
Tell me, will we fall off?
I don't wanna think like that.
I don't wanna be like that.
Hold your applause until the let down,
'Cause no one stays in 1st class, not forever.
I hope you watch me through the let down,
Because no one will be here, be here forever.
All wrong,
Tell me, are we all wrong?
I don't wanna think like that.
I don't wanna be like that.
Tell me, are we far gone?
Tell me, will we fall off?
I don't wanna think like that.
I don't wanna be like that.
