I wish that we could talk about it
But there, that's the problem
With someone new I couldn't start it
Too late for beginnings

The little things that made me nervous
Are gone in a moment
I miss the way that we used to argue
Locked in the basement

I wake up and the phone is ringing
Surprised as it's early
And that should be a perfect warning
That something's a problem

To tell the truth I saw you comming
The way you were breathing
But nothing can prepare you for it
The voice on the other end

The worst is all the lovely weather
I'm stunned it's not raining
The coffee isn't even bitter
Because, what's the difference
There's all the work than needs to be done
Is late for revision
There's all the time and all the planning
And songs to be finished

And it keeps comming
And it keeps comming
And it keeps comming
'til the day stops

And it keeps comming
And it keeps comming
And it keeps comming
'til the day stops

And it keeps comming 'til the day stops

I wish that we could talk about it
But there, that's the problem
With someone new I couldn't start it
Too late for beginnings

You're smaller than my wife imagined
Surpirsed you were human
There shouldn't be this radio silence
But what are the options

When someone great is gonne We're saved for the moment
Saved for the moment
