When nightmares come, keep you awake
Baby close your eyes, I'll take the weight
But I won't speak, I will refrain and be the song
Just be the song
When inner scars show on your face
And darkness hides your sense of place
Well, I won't speak, I will refrain and be the song
Just be the song

Flow down all my mountains, darling fill my valleys
Flow down all my mountains, darling fill my valleys
Flow down all my mountains, darling fill my valleys

And when you run far from my eyes
Then I will come, in dead of night
But I won't speak until morning light
I'll be the song, just be the song

Flow down all my mountains, darling fill my valleys
Flow down all my mountains, darling fill my valleys
Flow down all my mountains, darling fill my valleys
Flow down all my mountains, darling fill my valleys
Flow down all my mountains, darling fill my valleys
Flow down all my mountains, darling fill my valleys
Flow down all my mountains, darling fill my valleys
Flow down all my mountains, darling fill my valleys
Flow down all my mountains, darling
Flow down all my mountains
