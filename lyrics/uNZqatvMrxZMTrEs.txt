You stretch me out like a rubber band, you got my life in the palm of your hand

(That's what you did to me baby)

You stretch me out like a rubber band, you got my life in the palm of your hand

(Listen to me)

Like the bird yeah, with a broken wing, honey
I picked you up yeah, and made you sing again, yes I did
And now baby, you're back up on your feet
All you want to do baby, is run the street, but listen
You knew, it wouldn't last forever
It's gonna take some time, to pull myself together, oh

You stretch me out like a rubber band, you got my life in the palm of your hand
You stretch me out like a rubber band, you got my life in the palm of your hand

(Listen, I'm gonna tell the world about you)

You gave me love, then you broke my heart, yes you did
Took all my dreams, and tore them all apart honey
Do you recall baby? Did you forget Honey?
I dried your eyes, on the days that they were wet, But listen
You knew, it wouldn't last forever
It's gonna take some time, to get myself together, yeah

(It's alright, oh I'll get over it baby)

You knew, it wouldn't last forever
I'm gonna take some time, and get myself together, cause

You stretch me out like a rubber band, you got my life in the palm of your hand
