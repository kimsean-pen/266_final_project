Sent to death in a filthy Colosseum
By an ugly secretary who goes by the name of Mary
Living the life less ordinary, London Beriberi
Shoot to maim even though she wanna kill
Indiscretions tell the tales
So forget about the children
All this and that and
Always attacking him
A nibble on the crack and
Go tell 'em, I only write my felon
Poke the needle in the eye
Burning s, breaking ties
Spark a new-born, blue blood, royal baby cry
Til her face turns red
Til the green has bled
Last rites are said
Worms are fed
And the headline said

The Queen is dead (The Queen is dead)
The Queen is dead (The Queen is dead)
The Queen is d-d-d-d-dead
She's Dead
The Queen is dead (The Queen is dead)
The Queen is dead (The Queen is dead)
The Queen is dead

Met an America
Vomit on the carper
Joined in the fellowship
Ready for a road trip
Settled in a settlement
A calm man's habitat
Interesting development
Her body for a handbag
Mouth like a pelican
Draft up the relevance
Habitat from the cold
Money money money money money money
