Tall, dark and Superman
He puts papers in his briefcase
And drives away
To save the world
Or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes
His father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much
That I miss him
I hang on every word you say, "Hey"

You'll smile and say "How are you?"
And I'll say "Just fine"
I always forget to tell you I love you
I love you, forever

I watch Superman fly away
You got a busy day today
Go save the world
I'll be around
I watch Superman fly away
Come back
I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated
He's irrational
But I hope someday he'll take me away
And save the day
Something in his deep brown eyes
Has me saying
"He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say"

You'll leave, got places to be
And I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day

I watch Superman fly away
You got a busy day today
Go save the world
I'll be around
I watch Superman fly away
Come back
I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here
On the ground
When you come back down

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away but I never let you go
I'm lovestruck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget
Where I'll be

Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you
'Cause I loved you from the very first day

I watch Superman fly away
You got a busy day today
Go save the world
I'll be around
Forever and ever
I watch Superman fly away
I swear I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here
On the ground
When you come back down
When you come back down
