I'm a friend of the nothing
We're going out this weekend
Maybe go see a movie
Baby there's nothing to see
You've been waiting for something
You've been waiting for something to happen
I've been waiting for nothing
I've been waiting for nothing

I'm a friend of the nothing
We're going out this weekend
Maybe go see a movie
Baby there's nothing to see
I've been sleeping till sunset
You're the only one who gets it
Gotta get my alarm set

Gotta find a new outlet
Break my face and steal my guitar
Break my heart, take it apart

I'm a friend of the nothing
I'm a friend of the nothing
Break my face and steal my guitar
Break my heart, take it apart
I'm a friend of the nothing
I'm a friend of the nothing

Nothing will and nothing could
Nothing makes me feel this good
It's nothing
