This is a story, a very special story.
It's about Brian Jones, one of the Rolling Stones.

Where were you when the stars went out?
Where were you when they started to shout?
I saw you alone by the pool,
and all your friends called you a fool.
Godstar, Godstar. Godstar, Godstar. Godstar, Godstar. God... star.

And you were so beautiful, you were so very special,
I wish I was with you now, I wish I could save you somehow.

Godstar, Godstar. Godstar, Godstar. Godstar, Godstar. God... star.
(Echoing chorus): Brian, Brian, Brian.
Brian, Brian, Brian.
Godstar, Godstar. Godstar, Godstar. Godstar, Godstar. God... star.

Where were all your friends that night
as you switched off the final light?
I saw your body in the water
Like a lamb going to the slaughter

And where were all of your laughing friends?
Where were they at the very end?
They started to steal your glory
They never even told your story

Godstar, Godstar. Godstar, Godstar. Godstar, Godstar. God... star.
