Woe to you, oh Earth and Sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixty-six

I left alone
My mind was blank
I needed time to think
To get the memories from my mind
What did I see?
Can I believe
That what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I saw
In my old dreams
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
'Cause in my dreams
It's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair

Night was black
Was no use holding back
'Cause I just had to see
Was someone watching me
In the mist
Dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real
Or just some kind of hell?

666 the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
As they start to cry
Hands held to the sky
In the night the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun
Satan's work is done

666 the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

This can't go on
I must inform the law
Can this still be real or just some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
Seem to mesmerize
Can't avoid their eyes

666 the number of the beast
666 the one for you and me

I'm coming back
I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire
I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course
