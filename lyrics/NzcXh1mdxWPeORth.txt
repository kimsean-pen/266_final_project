Alright!
Waiting your turn, Just to die
You wish that someone could be by your side
You're so afraid to be alone
You need my help so that you can be strong

And what will you miss
when death gives you a kiss

Live in a room with your solid walls
You can't get out although you call
Looking around and what you see
A thousand souls and there ready to scream

And what will you miss
when the death gives you a kiss

Such a strange moaning in the air
Can you feel the breeze through your hair
Rolling around across the ground
Hoping that soon you will be found yeah

And what will you miss
When the death gives you a kiss

Oh yeah!

The evil darkness that you can't see through
Turns you around makes a fool out of you
Looking behind you can you see the dawn
Wasted your chance and now your life is gone

Your life is gone yeah!
