I would never let a tear fall from your eyes
No, no, no, no, no
'Cause everything you are to me
Oooh, I could never let you hurt inside
You mean so much and I'm so thankful that you're in my life
And I appreciate your love and all your sacrifice
Without you by my side, I never could survive
I wouldn't be the woman standing here before your eyes

You taught me strength and you gave me guidance
Whenever faith was lost, you were there to find it
And all because a mother's love is unconditional
With all my heart and all my soul, I wanna let you know

Said I thank you (I thank you)
And I love you (I love you)
And I would never ever place no one above you
Said I thank you (I thank you)
And I love you (I love you)
And I would never ever place no one above you
You have given me life and I just want you to know
That you're the reason I'm here today, I will never let go
To everything that we share and nothing can compare
I thank you, I thank you, I thank you
It's what I'm saying, yeah-yeah

See, I've been blessed to be raised by a woman so strong, mhm-mhmm
'Cause even when I did things wrong
You would show me just the way that I should carry on
You kept me safe, and you protected me with all you had
And any time I was in need you gave your very last
Without you by my side, I never could survive
I wouldn't be the woman standing here before your eyes

You taught me strength and you gave me guidance
Whenever faith was lost, you were there to find it
And all because a mother's love is unconditional
With all my heart and all my soul, I wanna let you know

That I thank you (I thank you)
And I love you (I love you)
And I would never ever place no one above you
Said I thank you (I thank you)
And I love you (I love you)
And I would never ever place no one above you
You have given me life and I just want you to know
That you're the reason I'm here today, I will never let go
To everything that we share and nothing can compare
I thank you, I thank you, I thank you
It's what I'm saying, yeah

I remember wakin' up early Monday morning
With my new dress and my new shoes, with the buckles on 'em
And you would kiss my face, and say "I love you, babe"
And you would be right there to take all of my fear away
And when he broke my heart, you said it was his lost
And not to think about, "You're better off without him"
Remember when they said that I was never gonna make it?
You said "it's yours, and all you gotta do is go and take it"

Said I thank you (I thank you)
And I love you (I love you)
And I would never ever place no one above you
Said I thank you (I thank you)
And I love you (I love you)
And I would never ever place no one above you
See, you have given me life and I just want you to know
That you're the reason I'm here today, I will never let go
To everything that we share and nothing can compare

Said I thank you (I thank you)
And I love you (I love you)
And I would never ever place no one above you
Said I thank you (I thank you)
And yes, I love you (I love you)
And I would never ever place no one above you
See, you have given me life and I just want you to know
That you're the reason I'm here today, I will never let go
To everything that we share and nothing can compare
I thank you, I thank you, I thank you
It's what I'm saying

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh
Mhm-mhmm
Mhm-mhmm
