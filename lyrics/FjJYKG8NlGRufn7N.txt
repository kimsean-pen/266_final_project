i can't explain all the things that i'm feeling
and when i look i don't know what i'm seeing
she say's relax
if i want you
we'll go slow
i close my eyes and
it all goes away though

what she wants is she wants me to no-no
it happens fast but the feeling is slow-mo
i know what
she wants
but she's never
going to get it
make up your mind or
you better forget it
