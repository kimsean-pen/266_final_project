You're in my head almost all the time
I need to let you go
I've dreamt about you every night, when you told me no
I know this won't just work its way out
I need to fall in two
You were there and I let you go
And I really know

Cause you're wasting all of my time, again
And I don't wanna give in

I do, I want you everyday
After I didn't at all
I feel like I'm not good for you and it makes me groan
I never wanted you when you were here
And now it seems that I do
I need you for me
All of you and babe you're cute

Cause you're wasting all my time, again
And I don't wanna give in
Time again, and I don't wanna give in
