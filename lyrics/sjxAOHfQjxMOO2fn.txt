Oh oh mmm
Well I wonder could it be
When I was dreaming 'bout you baby, you were dreaming of me
Call me crazy, call me blind
To still be suffering is stupid after all of this time
Did I lose my love to someone better
And does she love you like I do, I do
You know I really really do

Well hey, so much I need to say
Been lonely since the day
The day you went away
So sad but true for me there's only you
Been crying since the day
The day you went away
Oh wow yeah he he oh oh oh

I remember date and time
September twenty second Sunday twenty five after nine
In the doorway with your case
No longer shouting at each other there were tears on our faces
And we were letting go of something special
Something we'll never have again,
I know I guess I really really know

Well hey, so much I need to say
Been lonely since the day
The day you went away
So sad but true for me there's only you
Been crying since the day
The day you went away
The day you went away
The day you went away

Oh wow yeah he he oh oh oh oh
Did I lose my love to someone better
And does she love you like I do, I do
You know I really really do

Well hey, so much I need to say
Been lonely since the day
The day you went away
So sad but true for me there's only you
Been crying since the day
The day you went away

Why do we never know what we've got 'til it's gone?
How could I carry on?
The day you went away

'Cause I've been missing you so much I have to say
Been crying since the day
The day you went away
The day you went away
The day you went away
