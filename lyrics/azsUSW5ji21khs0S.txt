From the top you can see so far into the distance.
Look, it's downhill all the way from here.
And getting there is quicker, let go and you just slide.
Shouldn't take more then a year.

I could almost like you,
Now it's nearly over,
Now you've shown some weakness,
Now you're looking older.

I heard what you said,
And I recognised those feelings.
I know how hard it is to watch it go.
And all the effort that it took to get there in the first place
And all the effort not to let the effort show.

I could almost like you
Now you're falling over.
Now you're feeling hopeless,
Now you're looking over your shoulder.

Who's gonna come and find you?
Who's gonna come and find you?
Who's gonna come and find you?
Who's gonna come and find you?

If you can ride the backlash
There's still time for a comeback.
You don't have to lie down and die.
But Lazarus he only did it the one time -
He couldn't face another try.

I could almost like you
Now it's really over,
Now you've shown some weakness,
Now you're looking over your shoulder.

Who's gonna come and find you?
Who's gonna come and find you?
Who's gonna come and find you?
Who's gonna come and find you?
Who's coming up behind you.
Who's gonna come and find you?
