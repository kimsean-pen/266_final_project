Forget about the things they want you to be
Don't change a thing, not again, not again, not again
You just need to exist to make sense, don't you?
Don't run away, not again, not again, not again

Forget about places they want you to go
Don't change a thing, not again, not again, not again
You just need to remember they don't own you
Don't run away, not again, not again, not again

Do do do, do do do your thing
Shut their mouths and do your...

It's too late if they think they're gonna hurt you someday
It's too late if they think they're gonna change you
It's too late if they think they're gonna fool you someday
It's too late
