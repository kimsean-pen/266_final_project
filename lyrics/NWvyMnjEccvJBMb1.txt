Walking down the levee with my head hanging low
Looking for my mama but she ain't here no more
Baby you don't know, you don't know my mind
When you see me laughing, I'm laughing just to keep from crying

She won't cook my dinner, won't wash my clothes
Won't do nothing but walk the road
Baby you don't know, you don't know my mind
When you see me laughing, I'm laughing just to keep from crying

My breakfast on the table and my coffee's getting cold
And mama's in the kitchen getting sweep ...
Baby you don't know, you don't know my mind
When you see me laughing, I'm laughing just to keep from crying

Sometimes I think my baby's too good to die
Sometimes I think she should be buried alive
Baby you don't know, you don't know my mind
When you see me laughing, I'm laughing just to keep from crying

I wish I had a nickel, I wish I had a dime
I wish I hadn't give myself a fabulous time
Baby you don't know, you don't know my mind
When you see me laughing, I'm laughing just to keep from crying

Look at you mama, see what you got it done
You got my money now you broke and run
Baby you don't know, you don't know my mind
When you see me laughing, I'm laughing just to keep from crying

You made me get mad and you made me get sad
Going gets tougher than you have ever had
Baby you don't know, you don't know my mind
When you see me laughing, I'm laughing just to keep from crying.
