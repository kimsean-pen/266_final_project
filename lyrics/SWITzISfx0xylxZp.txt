I'm as fake as a wedding cake
And I'm vague and I know that I'm homopolitan

Pitifully predictable
Correctly political

I'm the new, I'm the new, new model
I've got nothing inside
Better in the head and in bed
At the office
I can suck it and smile
New, New, New model
New, New, New model

I can choke and diet on coke
I'm spun and I know
That I'm stoned and rolling

Lifelike and poseable
Hopeless and disposable

I'm the new, I'm the new, new model
I've got nothing inside
Better in the head and in bed
At the office
I can suck and smile
New, New, New model
New, New, New model
New, New, New model
New, New, New model

Pitifully predictable
Correctly political
Pitifully predictable
Correctly political

Don't let them know how far you go
Or that you use your "lovers"
Oh look, you're like a VCR
Stick something in to know
Just who you are

I'm the new, I'm the new, new model
I've got nothing inside
Better in the head and in bed
At the office
I can suck and smile
New, New, New model
New, New, New model
New, New, New model
New, New, New model
New, New, New model
New, New, New model
New, New, New model
New, New, New model
