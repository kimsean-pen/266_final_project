And though we know
How far we've come
We stay possessed
By what we lost

And we both know
Love's not in our hearts
Yeah we both know
Love's not in our hearts
And we both know
Love's not in our hearts
And we both know
Love's not in our hearts

(But not in our hearts)
We're never going backwards
We're never growing young (not in our hearts)
We're never coming back here
We're never
Love's not in our hearts

Are we all the same, different
Promise you the fire's heart
Are we all the same, different
Promise you, promise more

And though we know how far we crawl
We know, it's not in our hearts
We stay possessed by what we lost
No, not in our hearts

We're never going backwards
We're never growing young (not in our hearts)
We're never coming back here
We're never what you are

We're never going backwards (not in our hearts)
We're never growing young (not in our hearts)
We're never coming back here (not in our hearts)
We're never
Love's not in our hearts
