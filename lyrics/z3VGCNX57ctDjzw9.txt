It feels like sinking in
So unsure how to start, where to begin
Distress hold the knife but I'm not afraid
Love lost delinquents, I'll hold the blade

Fright as your crutch
Crimson turned white
No inch left untouched
Before I've had my first bite
Feels like sinking in

We try and evade our heartless cage
This is no alarm for distress

How does it feel with my teeth in your heart?
Don't back down again, no one leaves a scar quite like I can
How does it feel when you've played your last card?
In this together now, come this far won't let you down

I won't let you down
(How does it feel?)
Won't let you down
(How does it feel?)
I won't let you down
(How does it feel?)
Won't let you down

All for something all at once
The burdens we reap will be the promise that we keep
In the darkest hours I escape your eyes
In the haze, and let these visions materialize

How does it feel with my teeth in your heart?
No matter what you do, I'd shoot poison if it felt like you
How does it feel when you've played your last card?
In this together now, come this far won't let you down

I won't let you down
(How does it feel?)
Won't let you down
(How does it feel?)
I won't let you down
(How does it feel?)
Won't let you down

Pleasure in panic, just seize and hold tight
My body will follow if you hold my mind
Pleasure in panic, just seize and hold tight
My body will follow if you hold my mind

How does it feel with my teeth in your heart?
Don't back down again, no one leaves a scar quite like I can
How does it feel when you've played your last card?
In this together now, come this far won't let you down

I won't let you down
(How does it feel?)
Won't let you down
(How does it feel?)
I won't let you down
(How does it feel?)
Won't let you down
