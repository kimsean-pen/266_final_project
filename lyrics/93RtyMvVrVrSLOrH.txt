We've been on the run
Driving in the sun
Looking out for number one
California here we come
Right back where we started from

Hustlers grab your guns
Your shadow weighs a ton
Driving down the 101
California here we come
Right back where we started from

California here we come

On the stereo
Listen as we go
Nothings gonna stop me now
California here we come
Right back where we started from

Pedal to the floor
Thinking of the roar
Gotta get us to the show
California here we come
Right back where we started from

California here we come
California
California here we come
Oh
...
California, California here we come
California, California here we come
California, California here we come
California, California here we come
