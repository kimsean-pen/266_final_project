Take it back, take it back,
Take that thing right out of here.
Right away, far away,
Take that thing right out of here.
Don't let them take me
To where streams are red.
I want to stay here
And sleep in my own bed.
Need all your loving,
Long blonde hair.
Don't let them take me,
'Cause I'm easily scared.
Take it back, take it back,
Take that thing right out of here.
Take it back, take it back,
Take that thing right out of here.
Right away, far away,
Take that thing right out of here.
I got this great need,
The need to stay alive.
Not ashamed of my creed,
I've got to survive.
So come on, baby,
Don't go away.
Just let them save me
For a rainy day.
Take it back, take it back,
Take that thing right out of here.
I got this need,
The need to stay alive.
Not ashamed of my creed,
I've got to survive.
So come on, baby,
Don't go away.
Just let them save me
For a rainy day.
Take it back, take it back,
Take that thing right out of here.
Take it back, take it back,
Take that thing right out of here.
Right away, far away,
Take that thing right out of here.
I got this thing;
I've got to keep it sharp.
Don't go to places
Where it won't shine in the dark.
So come on, baby,
Don't go away.
Just let them save me
For a rainy day.
Take it back, take it back,
Take that thing right out of here.
