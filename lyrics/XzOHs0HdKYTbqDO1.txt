Someone just told me that there's no tomorrow
And if that is true, I don't know what to do
Can't stand these troubles; I'm out of my head
Guess then I'm free to use them to clap and dance
'Member when we didn't know what to be?
I can admit that was somewhat bittersweet
Can't stand these troubles; I'm out of my head
Guess then I'm free to use them to clap and dance

I turned out as great as they could; knock on wood
Things are going just as they should; knock on wood
I turned out as great as they could; knock on wood
Things are going just as they should; knock on wood

Someone just told me to leave all my sorrow
If that is true, I don't know who to be
Could be these troubles are part of the plan
Could be we need to [?] just to take a chance
So I forget what was taken from me
I will bequeath from the victor your vacancy
Tell them "these troubles are out of your head"
Tell them "you're free to use them to clap and dance"

I turned out as great as they could; knock on wood
Things are going just as they should; knock on wood
I turned out as great as they could; knock on wood
Things are going just as they should; knock on wood
So far, so good
So far, so good
So far, so good
So far, so good
So far, so good
So far, so good
So far, so good
So far, so good
