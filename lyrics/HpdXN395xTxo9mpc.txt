You and me we're gonna be alright
We're gonna shake the crowd
We're gonna touch the sky

Dulling from within to find
a reason for it all
Lost for years
In the storm
Waiting for the rain to
stop from washing me away
I held on tight
Awaiting night

And I lay me down to sleep
And find a world where I was free

Imagine a place
Where dreams lead the way
And all of the colors fade of grey
Imagine the dream
Now close both your eyes
Fall into the violet skies

Deep inside your eyes it shows
You've been lost for too long
Out of touch
On the edge
I promise you will find a way
I found a pathway home
I'll carry you
You're not alone

So now I lay us down to sleep
I found a world where we are free

Imagine a place
Where dreams lead the way
And all of the colors fade of grey
Imagine the dream
Now close both your eyes
Fall into the violet skies

You and me we're gonna be alright
We're gonna shake the crowd
We're gonna touch the skies

You and me together we unite
We're gonna call them out
We're gonna ride the night

Imagine a place
Where dreams lead the way
And all of your colors fade of grey
Imagine the dream
Now close both your eyes
Fall into the violet skies

Imagine a place
Where dreams lead the way
And all of the colors fade of grey
Imagine the dream
Now close both your eyes
Fall into the violet skies
