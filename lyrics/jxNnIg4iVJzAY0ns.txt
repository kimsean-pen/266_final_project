Wasting away
Swear that we're having a good time
We Spend the days joking
But love to complain that there's no time
And So we're, planning and planning
But only to live in the mean time
We're climbing the ladder
But being stuck what ever was so fine
Was so fine,
So fine, was so fine
So fine, was so fine
Keep on keep running
Running and running
Keep on keep running
Can't seem to get away
Keep on keep running
Running and running
Keep on keep running
Can't seem to get away
Day after day
Sunrise turns into midnight
We bake them in a bit low
Go home with the crumbs and close our eyes
But still we're, spending and spending
Don't care what it is, gotta get mine
Tried to stand above the others
So weird to forget that we were the same child
So fine, we're so fine
So fine, we're so fine
Keep on keep running
Running and running
Keep on keep running
Can't seem to get away
You can lose everything you know
But they can't take that love away
So keep on keep running
It won't ever get away
So be good to your mother
Because it won't hurt the love away
You can lean on each other
But you won't beat the out of me
Keep on keep running
Won't ever get away
Keep on keep running (running)
Won't ever get away
Living for yesterday (running)
Don't expect things to change
If you're living for yesterday (running)
Don't expect things to change
if you're living for yesterday (running)
Don't expect things to change
Living for yesterday
Can't seem to get away.
