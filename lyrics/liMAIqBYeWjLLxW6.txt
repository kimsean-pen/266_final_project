Gawvi, get 'em
Hey Mineo, let's go (yeah)
I'm going in today
This my only shot
My life could end today
Yeah my heart stop
If I go out tonight I'm going out on top
I give it all this life ain't all I got
Yessir now wait a minute bruh
I see y'all rocking with your hands high
Waiting for that beat to take off, 808's on
standby
When I'm breathing bangers I say statements
that I stand by
The ground gon shake when that beat drop,
landslide
Please let me off my leash
I feel it, I feel it, I'm feeling too good
Like I'm a beast
Like a gorilla who's real in the hood
So I'm going on and on
I'll be resting when I'm gone
Rise and grind is what I'm on
Bruh that's why I wrote the song
Tonight I'm going off like
My life span just lasts all night
If I don't wake up in the morning, bruh I'm gon
be alright
Throw caution to the wind
Let go we bout to go in
No slowing down, we gon win
No slowing down, we know him
Brag
Tonight I'll risk it all to follow
And live like my life's over tomorrow
We love it
We go hard all week
'Til it's over ain't no sleep cause we getting it
getting it getting it
Insomniac
We be getting it getting it
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh... Insomniac
Insomnia -ay (gettin' it, gettin' it, gettin' it) Throw caution to the wind
Let go we bout to go in
No slowing down we gon' win
No slowing down we gon' win
Throw caution to the wind
Let go we bout to go in
No slowing down we gon' win
No slowing down we know him
Okay okay okay I get it
What's the point of playing the game if you
don't win it
I ain't never spit a sweet sixteen
I call that a gift so you know I gotta bring it
Y'all live like minutes is infinite
If time isn't money then why you tripping to
spend it
Finally found a girl that ain't in her phone all
the time so you know I had to ring it
Oh my oh god
That ain't common no girl that's impressive
I'm trying to fight for the cause
Y'all wanna fight in my comment section
I don't get it dawg, like dead beat dads I don't
get involved
They said I'd never be nothing but I think I still
turned out awesome
I ain't into talking I just get it done
They wanna get a job or wanna get a gun?
They want to get a blunt and get burnt out like
me in the sun
Wow, I think they on to us
Don't sleep mow that's insomnia
Y'all worried bout when them Jordans drop
But you ain't worried bout what your body
does?
Dang
