I don't know what I've been told
Lost inside this old ways grove
I can't feel you no more
Finding all of your flaws

Don't look now your losing face
Falling sideways fall from grace
Feel you no more
Finding all of your flaws

I don't know what I've been told
I don't know what I've been told
Overtold and overgrown
I'm watching I'm waiting for you to be gone

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

I know something you don't know
You're gonna get you're life back home
I know something you don't know
You're gonna get your life back home
