She says I smell like oak safety and home
I named both of her eyes
Forever and please Don't Go
I could be a morning sunrise all the time,
All the time yeah
This could be good,
This could be good

And I cant change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I cant change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to

My love, my love, my love, my love
She keeps me war
She keeps me warm

Do you hate your job?
Do you fall in love too easily?
Whats your favorite word?
You like kissing girls?

She says that people stare cuz we look so good together
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And I cant change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I cant change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to

My love, my love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm,

I'm not crying on some days,
I'm not crying on some days
Love is patient, love is kind
My love, my love, my love, my love
