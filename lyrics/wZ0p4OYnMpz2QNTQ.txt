I killed my former and
Left her in the trunk on highway 10
Put the knife under the hood
If you find it, send it straight to Hollywood

Hahahaha, hahahaha, hahahaha
Hahahaha, hahahaha, hahahaha
Hahahaha, hahahaha, hahahaha

Aura-ah-ah, aura-ah-ah
Aura-ah-ah, aura-ah-ah
Aura-ah-ah, aura-ah-ah

I'm not a wandering slave, I am a woman of choice
My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face
You want to pity me 'cause was arranged one man to love
But in the bedroom, the size of him's more than enough

Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura

Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura, behind the aura, behind the aura, oh

Enigma pop star is fun, she wear burqa for fashion
It's not a statement as much as just a move of passion
I may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil
I hear you screaming, is it because of pleasure or toil?

Dance, sex, art, pop, tech
Dance, sex, art, pop, tech

Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura

Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura, behind the curtain, behind the burqa, oh
