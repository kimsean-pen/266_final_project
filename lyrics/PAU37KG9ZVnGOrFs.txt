I don't mind if you stay
I don't mind if you go
I don't mind if we have to give it all away
It's yours and mine

Let's give it another shot
Let's try it in other way
Let's put the puzzle back together our way
It's yours and mine

Let's waste away
Let's save the day
Let's try to do it on our own

I don't mind (Tell me I'm the one)
It's yours and mine
I don't mind (Let me put your shoes and tell me I'm the one)
It's yours and mine
I don't mind

I don't mind if you go
I don't mind if you stay
I just want you to know
It's yours and mine, it's our time

Let's give it up
Let's throw it away
Let's remember all that we had in our time
It was yours and mine

I don't mind if we wait (Tell me I'm the one)
I don't mind if we stay
I don't mind if it's yours or mine (Let me put your shoes and tell me I'm the one)
It's our time from now on (Let me count your money, tell me I'm the one)
I don't mind (Tell me I'm the one)
I don't mind
I don't mind (Let me put your shoes and tell me I'm the one)

I don't mind if we wait (Tell me I'm the one)
I don't mind if you stay (Tell me I'm the one)
I don't mind if you waste it all away (Tell me I'm the one)
It's yours and mine (Let me put your shoes and tell me I'm the one)
It's our time
It's my time (Let me count your money, tell me I'm the one)
I don't mind (Tell me I'm the one)
