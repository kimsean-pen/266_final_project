Don't need your sympathy
I'm too busy feeling sorry for myself
You say you only wanna be with me
But you'd be better off with almost anyone else
A cool breeze or a skyline
Just give me something to make me feel alive
And I don't want to let you down
But I got a history of ruining everything I'm left around

You can see the void in my eyes
I know you know I'm lying when I say I'm fine
If you love me you should think twice
Cause no one wants a deadbeat valentine

Losing my mind
Wasting your time
Tell you that I'm gonna change
But I never fucking try
I've been feeling empty
Like the lining of my wallet
I'm constantly fearing the future
And I'm just being honest
God damn, show me the lay of the land
Put your faith in my hands
I promise I'll disappoint you
When you find out my head is a mess like my bed
I'm a lost cause
And I got flaws
And I swear to God that I care a lot
Or I used to, so I make due
With the hole in my soul
Pretend like I'm fine like you do

You can see the void in my eyes
I know you know I'm lying when I say I'm fine
If you love me you should think twice
Cause no one wants a deadbeat valentine

You can see the void in my eyes
I know you know I'm lying when I say I'm fine
If you love me you should think twice
Cause no one wants a deadbeat valentine
