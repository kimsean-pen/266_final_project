In the morning
I could take the burning sun
I could be the early warning, but I'm not the only one
So forgive me, cause its more than I can bear
In demand I make my mind up by deciding not to care

Stop giving me choices
Stop giving me choices

I'm a victim, of this day and age
I've forgotten how to feel
I've forgotten how to change
So I surrender, to the apple of my eye
I surrender to the wind, I will let the wind decide

Stop giving me choices (ooh ooh)
Stop giving me choices
Stop giving me choices (ooh ooh)
Stop giving me choices

I could fake it, I could break it till it hurts
I could take whatever words you say, pretend I never heard
So forgive me, shouldn't be so hard
It's they way I'm put together, so your never getting past

Can't we talk this through
Actions are not what I'm used to
Can't we talk this through
Actions are not what I'm used to

Stop giving me choices (ooh ooh)
Stop giving me choices
Stop giving me choices (ooh ooh)
Stop giving me choices
(I surrender)
Stop giving me choices (ooh ooh)
Stop giving me choices
(Please forgive me)
Stop giving me choices (ooh ooh)
Stop giving me choices

Without friction, we would float up into space
Maybe you could be the friction that will keep me in my place
In the morning, I could take the burning sun
I could be the early warning, but I'm not the only one
