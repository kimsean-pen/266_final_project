All lyin' across the ground
Try not to make no sound
When two men gonna break ya down
I said, "Two men gonna break ya down", I breathe

All lyin' across the ground
Try not to make no sound
When two men gonna break ya down
I said, "Two men gonna break ya down", I breathe

I take down what I need
'Cause you know I need to breathe
I'm tired of walking on another plane
Another plane, 'cause I feel insane

I step back to get to you
Cut back, I'm fallin' through
Another day I feel the same
I'm cutting and I'm bleedin' here with you

All lyin' across the ground
Try not to make no sound
When two men gonna break ya down
I said, "Two men gonna break ya down", I breathe

All lyin' across the ground
Try not to make no sound
When two men gonna break ya down
I said, "Two men gonna break ya down", I breathe

So keep those voices down
Even if you don't make no sound
A thousand voices makin' all the mistakes
The fire escapes and this code must break

I step back to get to you
I'm comin' back, I'm fallin' through
Another day, I feel the same
I'm cutting and I'm bleedin' here with you

All lyin' across the ground
Try not to make no sound
When two men gonna break ya down
I said, "Two men gonna break ya down", I breathe

All lyin' across the ground
Try not to make no sound
When two men gonna break ya down
I said, "Two men gonna break ya down", I breathe
