I remember April
when the sun was in the sky

and love was burning in your eyes

Nothing in the world could bother me
'cos I was living in a world of ecstasy.
But now you're gone I'm just a daydreamer
I'm walking in the rain
chasing after rainbows I may never find again

Life is much too beautiful to live it all alone

Oh how much I need someone to call my very own.
Now the summer's over
and I find myself alone
with only memories of you
I was so in love I couldn't see
'cos I was living in a world of make believe.
But now you're gone I'm just a daydreamer

I'm walking in the rain
chasing after rainbows I may never find again

Life is much too beautiful to live it all alone

Oh how much I need someone to call my very own.
I'm just a daydreamer
I'm walking in the rain
chasing after rainbows I may never find again

Life is much too beautiful to live it all alone

Oh how much I need someone to call my very own

I'm just a . . .
