How can you accept social suppression
This weak state of mind in our time
I demand release from hypocrisy
I'd rather die than be held down, forced down

Freedom or fire
Freedom or fire
Freedom or fire
Freedom or fire

I'm on the threshold of revolution
I'd rather burn than be held down, forced down

Freedom or fire
Freedom or fire
Freedom or fire
Freedom or fire

Unrestrained determination
Set ablaze for liberation

Huh!

Locked in chains of this sovereignty
Let me be 'cause I long to be
Free!
Free!
Free!

Locked in chains of this sovereignty
Let me be 'cause I long to be
Free!
Free!
Free!

Unrestrained determination
Set ablaze for liberation
Set ablaze
Set ablaze
Set ablaze
Set ablaze

Freedom or fire
Freedom or fire
Freedom
Freedom

Freedom or fire
