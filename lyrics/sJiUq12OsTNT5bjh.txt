Time told all
I was stranded in my head
From moments it was done but
Then I'd lie in bed
And miss your smile
And miss your laugh
I miss the memories from our past
And miss your smile
And miss your laugh
I miss the memories from our past
I don't wanna go home (home)
Alone (alone)
I don't wanna go home (home)
Alone (alone)
At the end of the night
When I turn off the light
And the bullshit fades away
I don't wanna go home
Alone
So open up that door and
Let's find a solution
Cause baby you're the world
I won't be your pollution
And if you cry I'll dry your eyes
I stand beside you I'll give you time
We both know I've got room to grow
Just hold my hand baby I'm never letting go
I don't wanna go home (home)
Alone (alone)
I don't wanna go home (home)
Alone (alone)
At the end of the night
When I turn off the light
And the bullshit fades away
I don't wanna go home
Alone
At the end of the night
When I turn off the light
And the bullshit fades away
And the bullshit fades away
You've got nothing to hide
I can see it in your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes
I don't wanna go home
Alone
I don't wanna go home
Alone
I don't wanna go home
Alone
I don't wanna go home
Alone
