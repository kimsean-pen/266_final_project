Oh, living without you
It's OK, I get enough
Are you happy on your own
Of course I am
Hold it together on the phone
Yeah I got plans

Oh I got tickets to Peru
I'm sure I'm over you
But if you change your mind

Yeah you can G.I.V.E. all your love back to me
I could always take some more
Yeah you can G.I.V.E. all your love back to me
If that's what you want

Oh, she don't wanna hear about you
Anymore, you know how it is
Does he get on with your folks
Of course he does
Is it time for me to go now
I've got my stuff

Oh I got tickets to Peru
I'm sure I'm over you
But if you change your mind

Yeah you can G.I.V.E. all your love back to me
I could always take some more
Yeah you can G.I.V.E. all your love back to me
If that's what you want
Alright

La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la

I know it wasn't perfect
But nothing ever is
You keep playing over and over in my head
I know that I lost you
But I still believe
That you were meant to be mine

Yeah you can G.I.V.E. all your love back to me
I could always take some more
Yeah you can G.I.V.E. all your love back to me
If that's what you want

Yeah you can G.I.V.E. all your love back to me
I could always take some more
Yeah you can G.I.V.E. all your love back to me
If that's what you want

If that's what you want
