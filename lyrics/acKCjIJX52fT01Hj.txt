Sick at heart and lonely
Deep in dark despair (ooooh)
Thinking one thought only
"Where is she, tell me where?" (ooooh)

And if she says to you
She don't love me (ooooh)
Just give her my message
Tell her of my plea

And I know
Well if she had me back again
Oh, I would never make her sad
I've got a heart full of soul

(solo)
And I know
If she had me back again
Oh, I would never make her sad

I've got a heart full of soul
She's been gone such a long time
Longer than I can bear (ooooh)
But if she says she wants me

Tell her that I'll be there (ooooh)
And if she says to you
She don't love me (ooooh)
Just give her my message
Tell her of my plea
And I know
Well, if she had me back again
Oh, I would never make her sad
I've got a heart full of soul
