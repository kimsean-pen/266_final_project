In my claws your open heart
In my veins I drain till silence
In my claws your bleeding heart
Life is blood
I drink till silence

All your fear put aside
Pacified
All you hold dear
Left to die
Horrified

Abrasive dissection
My martyr and my slave

As life force is lost
Pain and death is all you face
As life force is lost
Death is on your face

Abrasive infection
Deluded and profane
Feeding off the blood
Till nothing more remains

As I crawl your life impaled
Blood & death engulfed in violence
Memories now burning frail
Your church of light, greeted the darkness

On the floor your body starved
Soulless
Flayed and rained from suffering
Memories now burning frail
Life is blood
I drink
I vomit
Torn far beyond cremation's lust
Inject sulphuric acid in your brain
Crawl far beyond temptation's lust
No empathy
A craving will to slay
One life less lost
