Come a little closer
Feel a little bigger
Just don't forget to turn the lights off
So you can love a little darker

'Cause I worshipped you, oh I worshipped you
Like I'd always wanted to, always wanted to

'Cause you, you're a dark bloom
You brought me down to my knees
And I'm haunted by you
Oh, I worshipped you, how I worshipped you
I was let out into the blue and abandoned by you
Oh, I worshipped you, oh, I worshipped you
Oh, I worshipped you, and now I'm taunted by you

Fall a little further
And smile a little wider
Just don't forget to turn the lights off
So you can love a little darker

'Cause I worshipped you, oh how I worshipped you
Like I'd always wanted to, always wanted to

'Cause you, you're a dark bloom
You brought me down to my knees
And I'm haunted by you
Oh, I worshipped you, how I worshipped you
I was let out into the blue and abandoned by you
Oh, I worshipped you, oh, I worshipped you
Oh, I worshipped you, and now I'm taunted by you

'Cause I, I worshipped you, oh how I worshipped you
Like I'd always wanted to, always wanted to
'Cause you, you're a dark bloom
And I worshipped you, how I worshipped you
