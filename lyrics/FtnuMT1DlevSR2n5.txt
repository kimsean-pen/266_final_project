If they adorn themselves with crystals
to make them look sharp
Sleep with their hand on a pistol,
they're afraid of the dark
Well if it wakes you,
which it has to be known to,
don't be alarmed
Darkness can't do you harm
Fear will hurt you
And outside, if wind is beating
a tree to a bed
Don't fear that it might be meeting
some untimely end
They do what they're supposed
to but they have been known
to stand strong and tall,
weather it all
Take what you can
Never give orders,
just to be obeyed
Never consider yourself or others
without knowing that you'll change
It may not surprise you,
but pride has been known to
rise up a storm
Countless lives lost
at the hands of pride and I'll fall
Who'll weep for them? Sometimes I do.
I do sometimes
Who weeps for them? Sometimes I do.
I do sometimes
You can't see it, it might be behind you
Keep those eyes wide
You can't see it, it might be behind you
Keep those eyes wide
Don't be impressed
by strong personalities
Sincere words
are rarely sickly sweet
But if they fool you,
which they have been known to
Don't lose your sight,
know something's not right
and look at the stars
Be weary of being
given a name
if for some reason
you're not considered the same
Once they name you,
they have been known to
lock you in
Statistical sin
they'd rather ignore
Who'll weep for them? Sometimes I do.
I do sometimes
Who weeps for them? Sometimes I do.
I do sometimes
You can't see it, it might be behind you
Keep your eyes wide
You can't see it, it might be behind you
Keep those eyes wide
Keep your eyes on the back of your mind
