Tongues tied.
I abide.
In serpents eyes.
My demise.
And cast aside.
I will abide.

In absence.
In silence.

No solid ground to be found.
Blood to the root.
I don't belong.

I played my rope,
I gave up on hope.

All alone.

I kept my head up high.
At least I tried.

When I keep my eyes closed, I'm in your arms again.
And when I keep my head down, it feels like I am home again.
When was the last time there, this is all too much to bear.
Still I keep my eyes closed, I'm in your arms again.
Memories dissolve, and I am alone again.
And when I open my eyes, I am alone again.

Ever tried, ever failed
You for hours, you for years.

In your arms again.

For hours. For years.
In your arms again.
