It's 5 o'clock and the rain won't stop
And I feel like a prisoner in my own car
She's leaning on the sink, trying not to think
Wondering how much longer we can fake this thing

We're both giving more than we both get
This has been so hard, we don't want to give up yet
You're in there, and I'm out here
Can't bear to leave, can't stand to stay
So I'm just sitting here, parked in the driveway

Used to be you and me
Have a date in the front, kid sleeping in the backseat
This driveway was an open road
Didn't think at the start this is where it was gonna go

We're both giving more than we both get
This has been so hard, we don't want to give up yet
You're in there, and I'm out here
Can't bear to leave, can't stand to stay
So I'm just sitting here, parked in the driveway

The way things went, it was a long slow death
Put ourselves in the corner time and time again
It's hard to say if it's too late
But you'd give up or I drove away

Can't bear to leave, can't stand to stay
So I'm just sitting here, parked in the driveway

This house was a home a long time ago
We don't want to miss it, but I think we both know

We're both giving more than we both get
This has been so hard, we don't want to give up yet
You're in there, and honey I'm out here
Can't bear to leave, can't stand to stay
So I'm just sitting here, parked in the driveway
