Parala parala paralyse me
Every single bone in my body feel free
Boy what you want from
Boy what you want from
Boy what you want from me
Said it one
Get it one
Got it in the night
Coming into me like a parasite
Why won't you let me
Why won't you let me be
You keep on banging my door
You keep on asking for more
Oh boy how could I have now
Let you break through my window
And into my club
Like you run this town
You turned it up
And then we get down down down
Right into my club
Like you run this town
You turned it up
And then we get down down
We get down down down
Boy we get down down down down dededown

Anyhow animal
Tell me what's your name
Tell me about you like you got no shame
I got my eyes on
I got my eyes on
I got my eyes on you
Give me??
Give me what I need
Build it up, shout it like a symphony
Do you what you want boy
Do what you want with me
Tonight I'll be the bullet in your gun
Tonight go shoot me higher then the sun
Tonight you shoot me up
You do what you boy
Do what you want with me
You keep on banging my door
You keep on asking for more
Oh boy how could I have now
Let you break through my window
And into my club
Like you run this town
You turned it up
And then we get down down down
Right into my club
Like you run this town
You turned it up
And then we get down down
We get down down down
Boy we get down down down
We get down down down
Boy we get down down down
We get down down down down dededown

I get up now
I get up now
You're breaking in
You're breaking in
Right into my club
Like you run this town
You turned it up
And then we get down down
Right into my club
Like you run this town
You turned it up
And then we get down down
We get down down down
We get down down down down dededown
