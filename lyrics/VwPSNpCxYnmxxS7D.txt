Let's forget whatever we lost
Rolling around in the weeds
Finding ourselves broken
Looking for light in the floor

Let's become the lovers we want
Banging our heads in the fog
Flowers will close and open
Life going by like we care

One day is whatever we make
(Whatever we make)
From pieces off the side of a road
(Whatever we make)

Walked on our map of what hurts
What hurts worse
Let's become the lovers we need
Who'd knew we'd needing so much
We keep finding ourselves broken
Tossed in the yard with the bones
And let's forget whatever we know
Knowing all too little, too late
Laying down in our own horizon
Letting that water hit home

Let's become the lovers we want
(Let's become the lovers we want)
Let's become the lovers we need
(Let's become the lovers we need)
Let's become the lovers we want
(Let's become the lovers we want)
Let's become the lovers we need
(Let's become the lovers we need)
