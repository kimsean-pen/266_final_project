Well I wanted to find somewhere to hide
And I opened up and let those fears inside
And I want to be anyone else
Only if I'm ... there was no one there but me

But I woke up into the real life
And I realized it's not worth running from anymore
When there was nowhere left to hide I found out
That nothing's real here
But I won't stop now
Until I find a better part of me

I let those hard days get me down
And all the things I hate got in my way
I could've screamed without a sound
I found myself silenced by those things they say

But I woke up into the real life
And I realized it's not worth running from anymore
When there was nowhere left to hide I found out
That nothing's real here
But I won't stop now
Until I find a better part of me

That's out there somewhere
And it can't be that far away
That's where I found myself
And I'll find my way out
That's where I found out...

When I woke up into the real life
And I realized it's not worth running from anymore
When there was nowhere left to hide I found out
That nothing's real here
But I won't stop now
Until I find a better part of me
