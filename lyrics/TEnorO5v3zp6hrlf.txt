Amongst the trees, amongst my freedom
My hands are red, I have been bleeding
What will happen, what will happen when I seduce you, teacher
Yes to greyhound rides, no to you by my side
I don't need you, I don't need anyone
Come back
Come back

Fire burning down at monastery road
Why'd you do it lover throwing matches in my home
How I begged him to take other women on
But he don't know where to turn
He don't know who to call on
Is that all? Is that all?

Apologies like the birds in the sky
And even they are falling like the tears in my eyes
Everyone's asking, everyone's asking

Apologies like the birds in the sky
And even they are falling like the tears in my eyes
Everyone's asking where's your child in this plan
Why you gonna ask me if I'd cut off my own hand
Is that all? Is that all?

Sly, you're still a liar
Your words are not enough
Sly, you're still a liar
Your words are not enough
Sly, you're still a liar
I need you to be rough
Sly, you're still a liar
I need you to be rough
Sly, you're still a liar
I need you to be rough
