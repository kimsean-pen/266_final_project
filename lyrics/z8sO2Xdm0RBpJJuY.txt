Fire me in an oven
Until I go hard enough
To deal with losing you
I'm tired of thinking of you
Each and every minute I see
Something I know that you'd love

All made of glass
All made of glass
Cheating ourselves to believe we'll be last
Like a fool
I thought it was true
I was holding your flowers
And only you knew

A diary fills its pages
With one eye on the clock
How long, how long have we got
Until we're everything we hope to be
Terrified while a picture of dignity?
Come eat with me
At the table of this life

All made of glass
All made of glass
(Yes) we're all made of glass
All made of glass
Cheating ourselves to believe we'll be last
Like a fool
I thought it was true
I was holding your flowers
And only you knew
Only you knew
