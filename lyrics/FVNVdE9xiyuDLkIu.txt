You'll get it right sometime, you will
I tell myself that every day
You don't need to latch on
To anything, you'll just end up back here

In your little limbo scene
It's repetitious and exhausting
I might need some therapy
Anything to keep me in check through the day

Don't think about your lover
You're already steady shaking
I might need a sedative
But I hate the taste of medicine

You just need to let her go
These pills shaking in my hand
Just make me feel defeated
Like I'm not able to just let her go

I hate this place, but I love these chords
An empty fate just means an even score
And the pain this morning, it filled my head
It's Jameson, it means that I'm not dead

And I just can't seem to get away
There's no such thing as escape
Even with the sedatives
You're always in the same state

Clutching to a limbo scene
You're never changing anything
You just stop the shaking
And it's constantly repeated through the days

I hate this place, but I love these chords
An empty fate just means an even score
And the pain this morning, it filled my head
It's Jameson, it means that I'm not dead

I hate this place, but I love these chords
An empty fate just means an even score
And the pain this morning, it filled my head
It's Jameson, it means that I'm not dead
