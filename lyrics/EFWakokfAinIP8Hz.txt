You take my love, you want my soul
I would be crazy to share your life, why can't you see what I'm
sharpen your senses and drawn the knife
hold me and you'll understand

I'll never be Maria Magdalena
(you're a creature of the night)
Maria Magdalena
(you're a victim of the fight, you need love)
promise me delight
(you need love)
I'll never be Maria Magdalena
(you're a creature of the night)
Maria Magdalena
(you're a victim of the fight, you need love)
promise me delight
(you need love)

Why must I lie, find any price
when will you wake up and realize I can't surrender to you
play for affection and win the price
I know these party games too

I'll never be Maria Magdalena
(you're a creature of the night)
Maria Magdalena
(you're a victim of the fight, you need love)
promise me delight
(you need love)

I'll never be Maria Magdalena
(you're a creature of the night)
Maria Magdalena
(you're a victim of the fight, you need love)
promise me delight
(you need love)

I'll never be Maria Magdalena
(you're a creature of the night)
Maria Magdalena
(you're a victim of the fight, you need love)
promise me delight
(you need love)

I'll never be Maria Magdalena
(you're a creature of the night)
Maria Magdalena
(you're a victim of the fight, you need love)
promise me delight
(you need love)
