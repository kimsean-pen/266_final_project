Homecoming, I'm coming
My sweet mistake
Summer's over, hope it's not too late
I'm pacing, impatient
Up in my head
Taken back to the sidewalk where we met

And carved out our names
Do you remember that?

I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Did you take off while I was gone?
I missed it all, I messed you up, I missed you
I'm coming home, I wanna know
When all the leaves begin to fall
If I'm falling, falling apart for you

Descending, I'm spinning
Lost all defense
How could you swallow me again?
I left you, I meant to
Couldn't let you in
Never mind a single word I said

Carve out your name
Do you remember that?

I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Did you take off while I was gone?
I missed it all, I messed you up, I missed you
I'm coming home, I wanna know
When all the leaves begin to fall
If I'm falling, falling apart

You've got control of me
Is this the end of me?
'Cause I just can't cut up the strings
I'm coming back for more
Don't let your heart go
Please don't walk away

Homecoming, I'm coming, I'm coming back

I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Did you take off while I was gone?
I missed it all, I messed you up, I missed you
I'm coming home, I wanna know
When all the leaves begin to fall
If I'm falling, falling apart

I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Did you take off while I was gone?
I missed it all, I messed you up, I missed you
I'm coming home, I wanna know
When all the leaves begin to fall
If I'm falling, falling apart for you
