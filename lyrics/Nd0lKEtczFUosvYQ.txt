i was totally nervous to go to japan
i tried travel once, i lost my keys
i was leaning in with my shirt tucked in
i was on that train repeating
how it's so illogical
it's nothing you can see
we repeat
try it one more time with feeling
it's easy

i'm waking in in a usual town
every morning is september
we could sleep it off and leave it all
but in the morning you remember
so i split the difference between lonesome and lonely
i lay right at your feet
i'm laying in when my love crushed in [?]
i was on that plane repeating
now leaving's so relieving

how it's so illogical
it's nothing you can see
it's no retreating
try it one more time with feeling
help me

how it's so illogical
it's nothing you can see
we repeat
try it one more time with feeling
it's easy
