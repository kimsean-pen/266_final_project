Swan Lake

Seeing in your eyes
Words can never say the way
Told me in your eyes
Final in a fade
Seeing in your eyes
Seeing in your eyes
Neve really know
Never realise
Silence in your eyes
Silence in your eyes
Never really know
Til its gone away
Never realise
The silence in your eyes
Seen it in your eyes
Seen it in your eyes
Never no more hope away
Final in a fade
Watch her slowly die
Sw it in her eyes
Chocking on a bed
Flowers rotting dead
Seen it in your eyes
Ending in a day
Selence was a away
Seeing in your eyes (3x)
I'm seeing through my eyes
