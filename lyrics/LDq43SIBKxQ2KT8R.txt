I went back, I went back to your love
And I felt so many wrongs
That I wasted on you by the crowd
And I called, you called me and I whispered your name
I went home, you stared blank to the pages I wrote
Well, I just wanna compliment your soul
I just wanna compliment your soul
Yeah, I just wanna compliment
And I wasted the years, I let go

So many rights, so many nights
that I come and I go
I just wanna know, do you,
And I can't ever be shut out
You're meant to be the wrong gal
Tell it twice
Cause I just wanna compliment your soul
Yeah, I just wanna compliment your soul
I compliment your
I compliment your
Yeah, I just wanna compliment your soul
I just wanna compliment your soul
I just wanna compliment your soul
I just wanna compliment your
