They call you an animal
The Kanchenjunga Demon
Wild man
Metoh, Kangmi
Lying in my tent
I can hear your cry
Echoing 'round the mountainside
You sound lonely
While crossing the Lhakpa La
Something jumped down from the rocks
In the remote Garo Hills by Dipu Marak
We found footprints in the snow
The schoolmaster of Darjeeling said
We saw you by the Tengboche monastery
You were playing in the snow
You were banging on the doors
You climbed up on the roof
Roof of the world
You were pulling up the rhododendrons
Loping down the mountains
They want to know you
They will hunt you down
Then they will kill you
Run away, run away
Run away
While crossing the Lhakpa La
Something jumped down from the rocks
In the remote Garo Hills by Dipu Marak
We found footprints in the snow
We found your footprints in the snow
We brushed them all away
From the Sherpas of Annapurna
To the Rinpoche of Qinghai
Shepherds from Mount Kailash to Himachal Pradesh
Found footprints in the snow
You're not a langur monkey,
Nor a big brown bear
You're the wild man
They say they saw you drown
In the Rongbuk glacier
They want to hunt you down
You're not an animal
The lamas say
You're not an animal
