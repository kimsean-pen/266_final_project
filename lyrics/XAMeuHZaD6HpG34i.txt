Yo, I'd be glad to drift some more
But I've a plan to hit the shore
These distant lands they need a hand to be explored
She writes to me, but does not come abroad
That's why I guess she can't be my broad
I love her so but she'll get bored

Across this planet [?]
She said my Spanish was so poor
I only know few words I need to learn some more
A Peace signs plan to close the doors
Way up high behind the sense of thought
Alone well I thought
Caught in this acidic downpour
Is about [?] the combat is a different type of war
They raise the bar to exasperate the poor
They raise the bar and close the door
I must be from the North
I must be Bah!
