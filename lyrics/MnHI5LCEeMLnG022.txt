One time is all it takes to want me
One time is all it takes to think you're the only
One might believe that I might care
One night is all I need to make you disappear

I always hate the way you love me
I always seem to love what never can be mine
I need to hurt myself so I can feel
Something just one time

I'll pull you in and keep you closely
Then spit you out and make you feel like you owe me
Your heart I'll use to heal my pain
So hard for me to feel like anything or any way

I always hate the way you love me
I always seem to love what never can be mine
I need to hurt myself so I can feel
Something just one time

I always hate the way you love me
I always seem to love what never can be mine
I need to hurt myself so I can feel
I always curse myself when something's real
I need to hurt myself so I can feel
Something just one time
