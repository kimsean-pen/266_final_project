Hello, baby
Yeah, this is the Big Bopper speakin'
Ha ha ha ha ha
Oh, you sweet thing
Do I what? Will I what?
Oh baby, you know what I like

Chantilly lace and a pretty face
And a ponytail hangin' down
A wiggle in her walk and a giggle in her talk
Make the world go 'round

Ain't nothing in the world like a big-eyed girl
To make me act so funny, make me spend my money
Make me feel real loose like a long necked goose
Like a girl, oh baby, that's a-what I like

What's that, baby?
But, but, but, oh, honey
But, oh baby, you know what I like

Chantilly lace and a pretty face
And a ponytail hangin' down
A wiggle in her walk and a giggle in her talk, Lord
Make the world go 'round, 'round, 'round

Ain't nothing in the world like a big-eyed girl
To make me act so funny, make me spend my money
Make me feel real loose like a long necked goose
Like a girl, oh baby, that's a-what I like

What's that honey?
Pick you up at eight and don't be late
But baby, I ain't got no money, honey
Ha ha ha ha ha
Oh, alright, honey, you know what I like

Chantilly lace and a pretty face
Ponytail a-hangin' down
A wiggle in her walk and a giggle in her talk, Lord
Make the world go 'round

Ain't nothing in the world like a big-eyed girl
To make me act so funny, make me spend my money
Make me feel real loose like a long necked goose
Like a girl, oh baby, that's a-what I like
