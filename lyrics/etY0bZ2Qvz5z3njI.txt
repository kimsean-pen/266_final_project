Never known anyone like you before
Someone who could make me smile
When I'm falling on the floor
Never laughed so hard till I met you
Somehow you get me when nobody else has a clue
It's ok to be me next to you
It feels good to be one of the two
Just like glue

Me and you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So glad I've got a guy like you

Me and you
Always got each other's back we do
'Cause everything's a little bit better
When you and I stick together
Stuck on you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Me and you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

If you need a shoulder, you got mine
If you're ever in a pinch you know
I'd give my very last dime
Two peas in a pod, me and you
In perfect harmony, we're bobbing our heads to the groove

It's okay to be me next to you
It feels good to be one of the two
Just like glue

Me and you-ooh
So glad I've got a guy like you
Me and you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Me and you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Always got each other's back, we do
'Cause everything's a little bit better
When you and I stick together
Stuck on you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Me and you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

You always got a friend, always got a friend
Always got a friend in me
I always got a friend, always got a friend
Always got a friend in you too
You always got a friend, always got a friend
Always got a friend in me
Always got a friend, always got a friend
That's the way it's gonna be

Me and you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So glad I've got a guy like you
Me and you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Always got each other's back, we do
'Cause everything's a little bit better
When you and I stick together
Stuck on you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Me and you
Me and you, me and you

Always got a friend, always got a friend (oh yeah)
Always got a friend in me (me and you)
I always got a friend, always got a friend
Always got a friend in you too

'Cause everything's a little bit better (yeah)
When you and I stick together
Stuck on you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Me and you
You
