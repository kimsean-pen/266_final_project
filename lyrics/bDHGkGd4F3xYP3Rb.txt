I bet you thought that I was dead and gone
You wouldn't know that something's even on
And when you're lying on the silver tracks
No difference to me

You don't know that you're a sacrifice
All my love has turned back into ice
People, when the sky is turning black
You'll know that it's me

Are you saving?
Are you saving it for me?
Are you saving all your precious love for me?
Are you saving?
Are you saving it for me?
Are you saving all your precious love for me?

I bet you thought that I was dead and gone
You wouldn't know that something's even on,
People, when the sky is turning black
You'll know that it's me

Are you saving?
Are you saving it for me?
Are you saving all your precious love for me?
Are you saving?
Are you saving it for me?
Are you saving all your precious love for me
