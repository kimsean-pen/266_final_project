Patience, shadow
For all your sight, there's no sight to see
Little shadow, little shadow
To the night, will you follow me?
Pardon, shadow
Hold on tight to your darkened keys
Little shadow, little shadow
To the night, will you follow me?

Closer, shadow, volume strikes
Still we're caught between all this sorrow
Little shadow
To the night, will you follow me?

Hey, shadow, stars, break of dawn
Take a turn for stars, to my fantasy
Little shadow, to the night, will you follow me?
Little shadow, to the night, will you follow me?
