Call me collect
Call me anytime you need to
I'll be waiting there
If you've got a girlfriend
Or a boyfriend
I'll be on the line doing my level best

Call me an asshole
Call me what you want to
I will love you still

Call me complaining
I will entertain you
And tell it like it is

If you start a band
Well, you can use my van
I'll be in the crowd, doing my level best
I'll scream with all my might
'Cause it's my level best

Call me divided
Call me at your lowest
I will belong to you

Call me at midnight
I can talk for hours
Discussing male privilege

If you are in trouble,
Something illegal
I'll be at your side
Doing my level best
If it breaks me up inside
It's my level best

Call me with bad news
Tell me that you loved her
I will listen to you
I will catch the next flight for any country

I will risk it all to do my level best

If you need a million
Borrowed by tomorrow
I would rob a bank to do my level best
I'd smuggle in drugs
It's my level best
I'd kill a queen
It's my level best
A thousand bright ideas
They're my level best
