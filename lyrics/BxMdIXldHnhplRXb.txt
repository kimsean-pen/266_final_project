Pushing the shame off my back
Telling the soul walk tall and don't lose track
Tipping it out of my shoes
It's weighing me down, it's weighing me down
Leaving the side of my house
Looking to find a friend, then leave again
Cutting the wires within, so I'll follow you now
Where do I begin?

Ooh
The better me is you
I don't mind
Ooh
The better me is you
And I know why

Quick, they're locking the gates
We were going nowhere anyway
I'm stepping with the sky
But I can't get close
I just circle wide
What you mean to me
I only whisper, whisper to the trees
You make space out of my side
You can only try, you can only try

Ooh
The better me is you
I don't mind
Ooh
The better me is you
And I know why

There's nothing behind us
That says I didn't try
Whoa-oh-oh

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

I have to live
I have to live
I have to live with me
