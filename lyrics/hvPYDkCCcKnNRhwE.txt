Tried to break love to a science
In an act of pure defiance
I broke her heart
As I pulled apart her theories
As I watched her growing weary
I pulled her apart
Having heavy conversations
About the furthest constellations of our souls
And we're just trying to find some meaning
In the things that we believe in
But we got some ways to go

Of all of the things that she's ever said
She goes and says something that just knocks me dead

You won't find faith or hope down a telescope
You won't find heart and soul in the stars
You can break everything down to chemicals
But you can't explain a love like ours

It's the way we feel, yeah this is real
It's the way we feel, yeah this is real

I tried pushing evolution
As the obvious conclusion of the start
But it was for my own amusement
Saying love was an illusion of a hopeless heart

Of all of the things that she's ever said
She goes and says something that knocks me dead

You won't find faith or hope down a telescope
You won't find heart and soul in the stars
You can break everything down to chemicals
But you can't explain a love like ours
It's the way we feel, yeah this is real
It's the way we feel, yeah this is real

Of all of the things that she's ever said
She goes and says something that just knocks me dead

You won't find faith or hope down a telescope
You won't find heart and soul in the stars
You can break everything down to chemicals
But you can't explain a love like ours

It's the way we feel, yeah this is real
It's the way we feel, yeah this is real
