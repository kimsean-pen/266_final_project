And sometimes the people are quite interesting
And sometimes they arn't
And sometimes we meet
And sometimes we talk
And sometimes we don't
And sometimes we do
And sometimes we please each other
And sometimes we tease each other
And sometimes there's cameras
And sometimes there's blindfolds
And sometimes there's handcuffs
And sometimes there's freedom
And sometimes they're men
And sometimes they're women
And sometimes they're both
And sometimes they're ghosts
They're usually ghosts
