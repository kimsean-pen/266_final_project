Take my breath away
I don't need it anyway
'Cause I'm fine here in my own forgotten world
Where I can be myself
Left with the hand I'm dealt
And it's hard to get a grip when you're holding onto something you just let slip away

All these thoughts stuck in my mind
Spinning 'round like endless time
For once in my life

I do wanna feel
Something you call real
And I don't think that I've got
Time for these scars to heal
And the days just go by
Leaving questions in my mind
I guess I'll find the answers
Some day in another life

Here with my old friend
The silence, in the end
And it rings all out that I cannot pretend
If I just close my eyes
And ask a thousand whys
Will it change or stay the same?
Will it ever go away?
The question still remains

All these thoughts stuck in my mind
Spinning 'round like endless time
For once in my life

I do wanna feel
Something you call real
And I don't think that I've got
Time for these scars to heal
And the days just go by
Leaving questions in my mind
I guess I'll find the answers
Some day in another life

Warning signs
Read "desolation
On the road of
Desperation"
Happiness machines
I'm coming clean
What can you do for me?

I do wanna feel
Something you call real
And I don't think that I've got
Time for these scars to heal
And the days just go by
Leaving questions in my mind
I guess I'll find the answers
Some day in another life

So here
Now I stand, at the end
Of a dark road out of hell
It's not so hard, as I depart
What a way to become a man
