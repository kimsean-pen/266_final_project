Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh

You're having a hard time and lately you don't feel so good
You're getting a bad reputation in your neighborhood
It's alright, it's alright
Sometimes that's what it takes
You're only human, you're allowed to make your share of mistakes
(Only human, ooh, ooh)

You better believe there will be times in your life
When you'll be feeling like a stumbling fool (oh)
So take it from me you'll learn more from you accidents
Than anything you could ever learn at school

Don't forget your second wind
Sooner or later you'll get your second wind

Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

It's not always easy to be living in this world of pain
You're gonna be crashing into stone walls again and again
It's alright, it's alright
Though you feel your heart break
You're only human, you're gonna have to deal with heartache
(Only human, ooh, ooh)

Just like a boxer in a title fight
You got to walk in that ring all alone (oh)
You're not the only one who's made mistakes
But they're the only things that you can truly call your own

Don't forget your second wind
Wait in your corner until that breeze blows in

You've been keeping to yourself these days
'Cause you're thinking everything's gone wrong
Sometimes you just want to lay down and die
That emotion can be so strong
But hold on
Till that old second wind comes along

Ooh, ooh, ooh
(Only human, ooh, ooh)
(Only human)

You probably don't want to hear advice from someone else, no
But I wouldn't be telling you if I hadn't been there myself, mmm
It's alright, it's alright
S-s-sometimes that's all it takes, haha
We're only human
We're supposed to make mistakes
(Only human, ooh, ooh)

I survived all those long lonely days
When it seemed I did not have a friend (oh)
Cause all I needed was a little faith
So I could catch my breath and face the world again

Don't forget your second wind
Sooner or later you'll feel that momentum kick in
One more time
Don't forget your second wind, wooh
Sooner or later you'll feel that momentum kick in

Don't forget your second wind
(Only human, ooh, ooh)
Don't forget your second wind
Mmm, that second wind
(Only human, ooh, ooh)
Mmm, yeah
