Do it all again, going nowhere
Just let it go
Wouldn't care too much, much too much
Happy with yourself?
Ever upset?
Ever wonder why it's easier to lie?
Oh just lie
And I feel it coming on

Are you at amends?
Are you content?
Have you found your one?
Does he like having fun?
I wish you the best of luck
It's how it's meant to be, what you're supposed to see
But that don't sit with me
I gotta disappear
And I know it's going to end

It's all going to end
It's all going to end
It's all going to end
