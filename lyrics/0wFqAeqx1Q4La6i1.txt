I want to be, in a tree,
watching you, watching trees.
memories of the trees,
watching you, watching me.

I stand alone in the cold
of an old, cold train station.
It was cold in the snow,
wind did blow, all alone.

It's about dreams, oh this feeling.
forgotten memories, oh this feeling.

I want to be, in a tree,
watching you, watching trees.
It's a fool who doesn't see,
what I see watching trees.

It's about dreams, oh this feeling.
forgotten memories, oh this feeling.

It's about dreams, oh this feeling.
forgotten memories, oh this feeling.

I want to be, in a tree,
watching you, watching trees.
memories of the trees,
watching you, watching me.

I stand alone in the cold
of an old, cold train station.
It was cold in the snow,
wind did blow, all alone.

I want to be, in a tree,
watching you, watching trees.
memories of the trees,
watching you, watching trees.
