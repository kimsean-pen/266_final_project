(Kimberley)
Backstroke lover,
Hiding undercover
And I talked till my daddy said,
(Nadine)
"You ain't seen nothin til your down on a muffin,
And I'm sure I could change your way"
(Kimberley)
There's a male cheerleader
Was a real young pleaser
All the times I could reminisce
(Nadine)
And the best thing lovin'
Was your brother and your cousin
And it started with a little kiss, like this

(CHORUS - All)
Walk this way
Talk this way
Walk this way
Talk this way
Walk this way
Talk this way
Walk this way
Talk this way

School girl Heidi with a classy kinda sassy
Little skirt coming way up her knees
(Heidi)
There were three young ladies in a school gym locker
I noticed they were lookin at me
(Keisha)
I was a high school loser
Never made it with a fella
Til my girls told me something I miss
(Heidi)
Next door neighbor
With a son, had a favour
So give me just a little kiss

See saw swingin' with the boys in the school,
With your feet flyin up in the air
(Nicola)
Singin hey diddle diddle
With the kitty in the middle
You were swingin like you just don't care
(Amelle)
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With the boy who was ready to play
Wasn't me he was foolin,
Cos he knew what he was doin
When he told me how to walk this way
