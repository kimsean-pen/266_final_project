Time of light is falling
Dark of night is drawing near
transcendental voices calling
whispering horror and fear
marching forward all alone
whitout vision I can see
into the depths of the unkown
are the secrets that will set you free
Distant are the stars that shine
not only those within our sight
but soaring beyond our highest mind
internally buring even more bright
levitating into the sky
atmospherical beach
breathing where no air lies
transcending out beyond our reach
hollow is the heart
that beats within the earth
death of winter starts
and walpurgis brings rebirth
