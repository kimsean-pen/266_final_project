If mother is the word for God
Pretense and religion are the dual facade
Think about this foolish game
We live again
Did we learn her lesson?
Or waste her blessing?

Beyond the disease
Beyond our lives
There is a little hoel between faith and compromise

Outside of suffering
Outside of lies
We swim into a storm of filth and crime

I am just a non-believer
Ready to kill the great concealer
Take my wisdom with conviction
Focus all your hate with pure decision

Drain into the hole of sorrow
Live life like there's no tomorrow
On self-destruction day
I choose to die

Rape me, erase me
Take my breath away

Control me and destroy me
As I swallow and obey

Mother
You knew the conclusion
But you closed your eyes
Where were you?

Where are you?

Abuse me, use me
You pathetic worm

Anoint me, disappoint me
Without concern

I'm just a deceiver
A non-believer
Trapped in time
(Trapped in time)

I'm just a deception
A misconception
Of a normal life
(A normal life)

Praise the addiction
That divides and multiplies
(And multiplies)

I'm just a reflection
Inflexion
Of a blood-soked suicide

Pretend that sin
Is without repercussion
Leave me in the consequence
Violated and ashamed
Within self-blame

Mother
You saw the intrusion
Why did you close your eyes?

I'm just a dormant
Better waiting in the back allay
To spill it blood blood blood blood
Suck it up and drown in the flood

Madame Satan
You suck and employ
The Worms
And the prophecy of the third rock from the sun

Dethrone the deceiver
The non-believer and terminate
The crone and the prophet of political vomit
Withering hate

Mother
You saw the intrusion
Why did you close your eyes?

Mother
You saw the intrusion
Why did you close your eyes?

I am just a non-believer
Ready to kill the great concealer
Take my wisdom with conviction
Focus all your hate with pure decision
To die

Mother is the word for God
Pretense and religion are the dual facade
Think about this foolish game
We live again
Did we learn her lesson?
Or waste her blessing?
