Pray for blood
Pray for the cleansing
Pray for the flood
Pray for the end of this nightmare
This lie of a life can as quickly as it came dissolve
We seek only reprieve
And welcome the darkness
The myth of a meaning so lost and forgotten (forgotten)

Take hold of my hand
For you are no longer alone
Walk with me in hell

Pray for solace
Pray for resolve
Pray for a savior
Pray for deliverance, some kind of purpose
A glimpse of a light in this void of existence
Now witness the end of an age
Hope dies in hands of believers
Who seek the truth in the liar's eye

Take hold of my hand
For you are no longer alone
Walk with me in hell
Walk with me in hell
Walk with me in hell
Walk with me in hell
Walk with me in hell
Walk with me in hell

Take hold of my hand
For you are no longer alone
Walk with me in hell
Walk with me in hell
Walk with me in hell
You're never alone
You're never alone
You're never alone
You're never alone
You're never alone
Walk with me in hell
