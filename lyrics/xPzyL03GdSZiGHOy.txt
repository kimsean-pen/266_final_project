Pilot of the biomachine
Manning the controls of a babbling monkey
The circuits behind the interface can't be seen
So the truth is up to me
Is this life but a dream

Is reality all my senses perceive?

It tears me apart from the inside
The story we've accepted with malleable minds
Dogmatic perceptions designed
In egotistical pride
Have led us blind

Short of sight
Wondering why our lives feel like they're lacking meaning
We have stopped believing
This is just a ride

Is reality all my senses perceive?
Is what I touch and I see all that lies in front of me?

We wonder why our lives feel like they're lacking meaning
We've stopped believing
This is just a ride
