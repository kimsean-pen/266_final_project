All my dark dreams drift like smoke in the breeze
The fear grips me as I fall towards my sleep
Here comes the nightmare that never ends
Here is the dream that makes monsters of men
Ooh ooh ooh

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
In the house of my soul
In rooms of ugliness and cold

Memories locked away
All the doubts and fears I never faced
Now they come again
I am falling down to meet with them

Fear within us all
Mine awake and they stand up tall
Look for the truth
Deepest cut of all from you

Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

I pray my sleep will break
Maybe this time I won't wake
Weakness I hide so well
This dagger in my mind will tell

It's my final stand
I make a fist out of each hand
To the shadows of the past
Take a breath and I scream attack
Look for the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through
Here's for the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, yeah
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
