Perth is lucky that she's pretty
Otherwise I'd hate that city
The only place my heart's been torn in two
Always worth the lengthy flight
And sometimes the warm sleepless nights
There's no such thing as coming back too soon

A different situation I don't know
When I have some more, the standard's low
I still can't recover from the way you let me down
I mean, you got a new girl, yeah, that's fine
But I think about it all the time
I resent the way you made me love your western town

Perth is lucky that she's pretty
Otherwise I'd hate that city
Isolated from my eastern life
Bands and bars on widened streets
Where beaches meet the urban heat
And people seem to be friendly and nice

I know I should probably let it go
But it's only now I finally know
That you were only trouble looking for a place to stay
Yeah, I got to visit somewhere new
Now forever tainted with thoughts of you
Didn't even get an inadvertent holiday

Perth is lucky that she's pretty
Otherwise I'd hate that city
Hate this city, love this city
Perth, you're lucky you're so pretty
