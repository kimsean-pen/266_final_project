Dunwich, Dunwich.
Dunwich, Dunwich.

Dunwich child,
you know not your father's name.
Dope numbs the pain,
ascend dark wooded hills to Kane.
Your mother's witches,
burnt at the stake for sorcery.
You were conceived,
upon the altar, rites obscene.

Child of Dunwich rise.
You have your father's eyes.
Child of Dunwich rise.
End the world that you despise.

Dunwich child.
Of whispered past now they'll learn.
High on the hill,
black clouds gather, now they'll burn.
Bay at the stars.
"Why was I born at all?"
Hear voice of doom,
from other worlds your father's call.

Child of Dunwich rise.
You have your father's eyes.
Child of Dunwich rise.
End the world that you despise.

Dunwich, dunwich.
Dunwich, dunwich.
