After everything we've been through
After all the times I've felt you
You wouldn't think I'd ask you why I'm here

It's all because I believe in you
I know now you believe in me too
I believe in you
I know now you believe in me too

I could not believe, I could not believe
In all the things you told me
I could not believe, I could not believe
If you had never shown me

After all the gaps I fell through
After all the times I left you
I wouldn't think your answer would be so clear

It's all because I believe in you
I know now you believe in me too
I believe in you
I know now you believe in me too

I could not believe, I could not believe
In all the things you told me
I could not believe, I could not believe
If you had never shown me

This doesn't mean I'll stop
I never thought that I'd believe
But now you feel so real to me

I never thought that I'd believe
But now you feel so real to me

I could not believe
You showed me
I could not believe
You showed me

I could not believe
You showed me
I could not believe
You showed me

I could not believe
You showed me
I could not believe
You showed me

I could not believe
You showed me
I could not believe
You showed me
