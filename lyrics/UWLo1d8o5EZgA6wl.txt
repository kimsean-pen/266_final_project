I don't wanna stay and put the weight on you
Cause maybe in the morning, you'll remember that before it
Got so hard it hurts, you used to want me too
And i never had to question what i said before i sent it

There's a line that you drew and i said it's all right
But i don't wait inside it
No i don't wanna waste no time
When i still want you

Just the same as nights we laid out on pavement
Drinking 'til we got wasted
Loosening Nike laces on our AF1s
Dancing around your bedroom
Things that i never told you
Now i'm alone and i don't know why this happened to

I just wanna stay the night and see this through
Cause maybe in the morning you'll remember that before it
Got so hard it hurts, you used to want me too
And i never had to question if you really ever meant it, yeah

There's a line that you drew and i said it's all right
But i don't wait inside it
No i don't wanna waste no time
When i still want you

Just the same as nights we laid out on pavement
Drinking 'til we got wasted
Loosening Nike laces on our AF1s
Dancing around your bedroom
Things that i never told you
Now i'm alone and i don't know why this happened to us

There's so much left for us to say
Why you just pushing me away
I never meant for us to change
No, i don't wanna waste no time when i still want you

Just the same as nights we laid out on pavement
Drinking 'til we got wasted
Loosening Nike laces on our AF1s
Dancing around your bedroom
Things that i never told you
Now i'm alone and i don't know why this happened to us
