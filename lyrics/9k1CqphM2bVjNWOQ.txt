They say if a tree falls, in the wild of the night, and no-one's there, no-ones around
to hear it, not a soul. Well. does it make a sound at all? The truth is, I don't know
the answer - but hand me a dictaphone, and oh, just for you, babe - this is, for you

If I never met you
Would you still exist? (ohh.)
Alone in a forest
Where would we kiss?

They say its pretty easy
Living by yourself
But dying alone could be hard
Especially if you have a dog

If I never met you
Would you still exist? (ohh.)
Alone in a forest
Where would we kiss?

I am the water
You are the leaves
Without me and you
There would be no trees
I am the water
You are the leaves
Without me and you
There would be no trees
I am the water
You are the leaves
Without me and you
There would be no trees
I am the water
You are the leaves
Without me and you
There would be no trees
I am the water
You are the leaves
Without me and you
There would be no trees

If I never met you
Would you still exist? (ohh.)
Alone in a forest
Where would we kiss?
