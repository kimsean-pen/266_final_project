In the dark lies a secret
In the mystic seventh black book
Nekron's dark words

He is Kron, Kron's disciple
He is sworn to return
To avenge the lost divine wars

Algalord arise, greater than before
Time of peace, not of war
Shouts of freedom from the castle's walls
Freedom in the land and
Hope for all... hope for all

Into the silent, dark and forgotten
Caves of Dar-Kunor
Deep in the secret book is awaiting
Unholy Warcry
Nekron promised bloody terror
Bringing death and hate to the new world

From the rocky mountains to the golden sea
To the barbarians' sacred hills
From the icy north and misty lakes
To the walls of Seth and elvish plains
All beware!

Into the silent, dark and forgotten
Caves of Dar-Kunor
Deep in the secret book is awaiting
Unholy Warcry
Nekron promised bloody terror
Bringing death and hate to the new world

Torment, pain and bloody rain... Nekron's resurrection
They must kill the demon king or fight another war

"Only one person could crossed the darklands sorrounding Hargor
and venture forth deep into the caves of Dar-Kunor...
His is a name the world will never forget...
He is Dargor!"

He is the chosen one
He walked out through the darkness
He met the wisdom's light
Chosen to find the last dark rhymes
The last rhymes of hell

He is Kron, Kron's disciple
He is sworn to return
To avenge the lost divine wars

There was only one who knew the way
He lived in the dark, lonely caves
The demon of the night could save the day
Should they take a chance or run away...
Dargor was his name!

Into the silent, dark and forgotten
Caves of Dar-Kunor
Deep in the secret book is awaiting
Unholy Warcry
Now they swore to band together
On a sacred journey
Called by fate, time to be great
Unholy Warcry
Nekron promised bloody terror
Bringing death and hate to the new world
