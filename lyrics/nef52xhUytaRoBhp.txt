Exit like a consolation
We are here in a thin section
All alone between dimensions
Is it a blessing or a pure evil?

Ten Commandments as a healing
Logic that does not work here
I am real and you are unreal
You can't imagine what I hear

I hear voices that are singing in unison
Deep all over the town
I hear strings that are ringing in unison
Deep all over the town

I drank too much
I'm not here anymore

I hear voices that are singing in unison
Deep all over the town
I hear strings that are ringing in unison
Deep all over the town

It's not clear
Is it a blessing or a pure evil?
The end is near
I have that feeling

Ringing in the air
All over the town
I hear singing in the air
All over the town see less
