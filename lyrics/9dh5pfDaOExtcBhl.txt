The man takes another bullet
He keeps them all within
He must seek, no matter how it hurts
So don't fool again

He thinks the answer's cold and his hand
He takes in his medicine
The man takes another bullet
He's been fooled again

Uncross your arms
Take and throw them to the cure, say
I do believe

Uncross your arms now
Take 'em to it, say
I do believe
I do believe

The lies tempt her and she follows
Again she lets him in
She must believe to fill the hollow
She's been fooled again

Uncross your arms
Take and throw them to the cure, say
I do believe

Uncross your arms now
Take 'em to it, say
I do believe
I do believe

Betting on the cure
It must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Yeah, everyone's got to have the sickness
'Cause everyone seems to need the cure
Precious cure

Betting on the cure
'Cause it must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Yeah, everyone's got to have the sickness
'Cause everyone seems to need the cure
Precious cure

I do believe
I do believe
I do believe
I do believe
I do believe
I do believe
I do believe
I do believe
I do believe
I do believe
I do believe
I do believe
I do believe
I do believe
I do believe, I do believe, I do believe

Betting on the cure
Yeah, it must get better than this
Need to feel secure
Yeah, it's gotta get better than this
Than this, than this, yeah

It must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Yeah everyone's got to have the sickness
'cause everyone seems to need the cure

I do believe, I do believe, I do believe
