Hello there
It's Frank
And this song is dedicated to Mario and Link
Due to their undying perseverance
Which I'm not sure I should do the same, but
Mario's never getting some
And Link's never getting some
So why would princesses love me
I'm not really making moves
I'm just kinda breathing
I work at fucking pizza places just so I keep eating
That's the type of shit
To make me go and smoke a fucking pack of smokes a day
That's the type of shit to make me ask my father "Are you okay?"
That's the type of shit to make me buy a flask for twenty five
And fill it up with Taka Vodka, only four ninety nine
That's the type of shit to make me write a song and fucking pray
That this one's better than the one that I wrote yesterday
Or yesteryear
Yes sir please
Let me get the recipe
To not being broke
Fuck, I'd really love to be a king, but Mario and Link
Should show that perseverance is not the end all to everything
The princess in a hallway and a robe
I asked if you liked coffee and scones
And she said "No."
But, I just killed a fucking Dragon though
With this sword that I made from the words of my soul
I just killed a fucking Dragon, though
I just killed a fucking Dragon though
But it's whatever
I don't even care that much
