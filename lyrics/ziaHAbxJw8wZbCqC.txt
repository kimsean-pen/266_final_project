Force me back, the living days
I'm falling, dying, forceful gaze
Nothing's here
And nothing's clear
And I need you
I need you here
And I need you here
And I need you here
I need you enough
Fall around lie around
Next to him next to her
It's ok
We can talk we can talk
This will hurt
Fall around lie around
Next to him next to her
It's ok
We can talk. We can talk
This will hurt
Force me back, the deathly days
I'm rising, serving, resentful gaze
Nothing's here
And nothing's clear
And I miss you
I miss you
And I need you here
And I miss you
I miss you enough
