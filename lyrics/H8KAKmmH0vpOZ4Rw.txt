Home is in the water
Home is in the water
Home is in the water
Where I'm in the water
Buried in the water
If there's magic in the water
If there's magic in the water

Just a little light flickering
Out on the horizon
Just a little light there
What do I...?

Should I know?
Should've known that
They'll be coming right back
Through the ripples of black

Just a little light flickering
Out on the horizon
Just a little light there
What am I...?

Your face
Your phasing
Swollen zodiac
In the ripples of black

If there's magic in the water
If there's magic in the water
I have found you
