When the blood dries in my vains and my
Heart feels no more pain
I know, I'll be on my way,
To heavens door,

I know when I'm not,
i'll be hoping i don't drop,
To a place where I will rise, like before,

I know when I'm not,
i'll be hoping i don't drop,
To a place where I will rise, like before,

I can feel, something happening
that I've never felt before
Hopeless dreaming will start,
Dragging me away from heavens door

I can feel, something happening
that I've never felt before
Hopeless dreaming will start,
Dragging me away from heavens door

When my mind stops thinking,
My eyes stop blinking,
I hope
Somebodys there.

And my heart stops beating
and my lungs stop breathing
in air,
I hope somebody cares,

When the blood dries in my veins and my
Heart feels no more pain
I know, I'll be on my way,
To heavens door,

I know when I'm not,
i'll be hoping i don't drop,
To a place where I will rise, like before,

I know when I'm not,
i'll be hoping i don't drop,
To a place where I will rise, like before,

I can feel, something happening
that I've never felt before
Hopeless dreams will start,
Dragging me away from heavens door

When my mind stops thinking,
My eyes stop blinking,
I hope
Somebodys there.

And my heart stops beating
and my lungs stop breathing
in air,
I hope somebody cares,

When my mind stops thinking
My eyes stop blinking
I know
At the end.
