Don't you wanna be with me
Can't you see what I've been going through
Cause I wanna be with you
(don't you wanna be with me)
Changes I've been going through
Cause I wanna be with you

It's all gone
The love that we have shared
Has gone away
Maybe it's better that we didn't stay together
Seems like we've gone through this a thousand times
Baby I still don't have the answers
Why can't you tell me why we couldn't be together
(ooooohhh)

Don't you wanna be with me
Can't you see what I've been going through
Cause I wanna be with you
(don't you wanna be with me)
Changes I've been going through
Cause I wanna be with you

Ohhhh why it have to be boy

See I didn't want to ever hold you down
But still I need love very bad
Was it that hard for you to show me some attention
Tell me baby did I push you away
Was I coming on too strong for you
Why can't you tell me
Tell my what I'm supposed to do

Don't you wanna be with me
Can't you see what I've been going through
Cause I wanna be with you
(don't you wanna be with me)
Changes I've been going through
Cause I wanna be with you

Don't you wanna be with me
Cause I really need you
Don't you wanna be with me

(don't you wanna be with me)

Don't you wanna be with me
Can't you see what I've been going through
Cause I wanna be with you
(don't you wanna be with me)
Changes I've been going through
Cause I wanna be with you

Cause the love we shared
Love has gone away
Don't walk away
Come on back now baby
Don't leave me this away
Can't you see
Pretty baby can't you that I wanna be with you
