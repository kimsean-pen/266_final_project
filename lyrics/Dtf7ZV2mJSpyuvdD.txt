I've been lost inside my head
Echoes fall off me
I took the prize last night for complicated mess
For saying things I didn't mean and don't believe

Believe in me
Believe in nothing
Corner me
And make me something
I've become the hollow man, I
I've become the hollow man I see

Oh, I see this echoing
You have placed your trust in me
I went upside down
I emptied out the room
in thirty seconds flat
I can't believe you held your ground

Believe in me
Believe in nothing

Corner me
And make me something
I've become the hollow man, I
I've become the hollow man I see

I'm overwhelmed
I'm on repeat
I'm emptied out
I'm incomplete
You trusted me
I want to show you
I don't want to be the hollow man

Believe in me
Believe in nothing
Corner me
And make me something
I've become the hollow man, I
I've become the hollow man I see
I see
