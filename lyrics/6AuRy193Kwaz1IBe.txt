Monday morning you woke up crying
The outcome of a stupid line
Said by some punk asshole on the street
It wasn't me, it wasn't you
It wasn't anybody you knew is it
Your old friend insecurity?

The one companion that stuck by your side
Since you were born

Tuesday night you were in a fight
The same old argument black and white
It's something that's eating your inside
It's not the food, it's not the booze
It isn't anything consumed so is it
Becoming a problem you can't hide?

And all those times you thought that you were wrong
But you were right

The devil on your shoulder gives you
Strength in paranoia
The countless times you call a few
Your best friend till the end of time
They'll always be there by your side
Solidify conditions you've abused
What that means you'll never have a clue

More than just a life long friend
no social life I guess we can pretend
It's not like I care but anyway
You always wanna leave you never wanna stay
'Cause you think if you drink too much
Then you will lose it
You'll drink your security away

The one companion that stuck by your side
Since you were born

The little voice inside your head
Annoying and confusing
That somehow tells you what to do
Socially you've lost your mind
And basically you're out of time
You try to build so much it breaks on you
What that means you'll never have a clue
