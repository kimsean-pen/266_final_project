Working out the man, so you always say
Without him to know you're checking him out
Talk so people here, so indiscreet,
Hoping they don't put it about.

You really like it don't you,
You really like him don't you

I'm not mugging myself oh,
I'm not showing my hands like you do
I'm not shooting myself down
I'm watching, just watching

I'm not mugging myself oh,
You're the best teacher that I ever know
I'm not shooting myself down
I'm watching, just learning from you.

You already know, he don't desire you,
I think he's always made it clear,
And when I'm standing there, beside you
You can't believe he's looking at me

Though ya know he doesn't like ya,
You don't want me to have him either.

I'm not mugging myself oh,
I'm not showing my hands like you do
I'm not shooting myself down
I'm watching, just watching

I'm not mugging myself oh,
You're the best teacher that I ever know
I'm not shooting myself down

Baby look, don't stand in my way,
It's enough, for all your mistakes

You really like him don't you,
You really like him don't you.

I'm not mugging myself oh,
I'm not showing my hands like you do
I'm not shooting myself down
I'm watching, just watching

I'm not mugging myself oh,
I'm not showing my hands like you do
I'm not shooting myself down
I'm watching, just watching

I'm not mugging myself oh,
You're the best teacher that I ever know
I'm not shooting myself down
I'm watching, just learning from you.
