Let's sit down and talk it over
Take my shoulder tonight
Look at me and tell me what is
On your mind this time
Gonna stay here 'til you got a smile on your face
I'm here no matter what, everything else can wait

Let's kiss and make up now
Let's kiss and make love
Don't wait another minute (let's do this)
Let's go with it (let's do this)
Kiss me and let's make up now

Let's be honest, let's be open
We're not broken, not yet
It's not easy tryin' to please me
I'm not perfect, I know that

I'm gonna stay here 'til you got
A smile on your face
I'm here no matter what
Everything else can wait (wait)

Let's kiss and make up now
Let's kiss and make love
Don't wait another minute (let's do this)
Let's go with it (let's do this)
Kiss me and let's make up now

Talk to me, it's alright, I'm open
Whoa, don't talk, we're not broken, not broken
I know that we can do this
Come, baby, do this (wouh) (right now)
Come baby, do this (right now)

Let's kiss and make up now
Let's kiss and make love
Don't wait another minute (let's do this)
Let's go with it (let's do this)
Kiss me and let's make up now
(Come on). Kiss me and let's make up now
Kiss me and let's make up now
