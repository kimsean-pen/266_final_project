Are the echoes coming back to you?
Is wisdom seeing patterns on a loom?
Like a blanket around you
You believe in colors when I saw you

Put your velvet on the moonlight
Have you lost your constellations eyes?
You could give a time, I wish I could be there
Wish I could make it right

Don't you worry, you'll soon be on the mend
That's no trick, that flicker of radiance
You'll feel lucky, darling, I'm sure of it
You'll figure it out and get good again

Stone wall run, hills are green
Golden dust and dandelion seen, about a soft serene
Oh, it's been so long since path of soft serene
It's been so long

But don't you worry you'll soon be on the mend
That's no trick, that flicker of radiance
You'll feel lucky, darling, I promise you this
You'll figure it out and get good again

You said you don't know why you don't feel free
No, it's not true but I know what you mean
I want to thank you for being so good to me
I just wanted you to know

Are the echoes coming back to you?
Is wisdom seeing patterns on a loom?
Like a blanket around you
We'll look out for each other
Yeah, I'll look out for you
We'll look out for each other

Don't you worry you'll soon be on the mend
That's no trick, that flicker of radiance
You'll feel lucky, darling, I'm sure of it
Figure it out, yeah, we'll get good again

I'll figure it out and we'll get good again
I'll figure it out, get good again

In a dream
Dandelion fields in a dream
