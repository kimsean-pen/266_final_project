You must have been a beautiful baby
You must have been a wonderful child
When you were only startin'
To go to kindergarten
I'll bet you drove the little boys wild

And when it came to winnin' blue ribbons
You must have shown the other kids how
I can see the judges eyes
As they handed you the prize
I'll bet you made the cutest bow!
Oh! you must have been a beautiful baby
'Cause baby, look at you now!

Does your mother
Realize
The stork delivered
Quite a prize
The day he left you
On the family tree?

Does you dad
Appreciate
That you're merely
Super-great
The miracle
Of any century?
If they don't then send them both to me

You must have been a beautiful baby
You must have been a wonderful child
When you were only startin'
To go to kindergarten
I'll bet you drove the little boys wild

And when it came to winnin' blue ribbons
You must have shown the other kids how
I can see the judges eyes
As they handed you the prize
I'll bet you made the cutest bow!
Oh! you must have been a beautiful baby
'Cause baby, look at you now!
