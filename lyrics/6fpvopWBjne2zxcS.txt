Shot back down
All we been searching for that relevant sound
But I keep knocking and there's noone around
Our future fumble and found
I taste the sweat from my brow

I come and ground
In 14 hours thought I'd figure it out
And went from Sydney but we window and I [?]
And way more error than trial
I'm not a blank not to fire

I keep having frustrations
I'm losing the patience
I'm still having frustrations
I'm losing my patience
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
(I'm freaking out)
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

Head in the clouds
I daydream drifting 'cause
My focus walked out
A clock keeps ticking but there's footsteps about
Of feet of pennies and pounds
We're getting hungrier now

Substance a style
I now got meat
I got my eyes on the die
I seen how blood feels but the length of a mile [?]
Don't miss me
I'll be worthwhile
I need to wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
I said i'm dreaming when we're all stars

Having frustrations
I'm losing my patience
I'm still having frustrations
I'm losing my patience
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
(I'm freaking out)
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
(I'm freaking out)
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
(I'm freaking out)
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

I keep having frustrations
I'm losing my patience
I'm still having frustrations
I'm losing my patience
I'm still having frustrations
I'm losing my patience

I'm still having frustrations
I'm losing my patience
(I'm freaking out)
(I'm freaking out)
(I'm freaking out)
(I'm freaking out)
(I'm freaking out)
(I'm freaking out)
(I'm freaking out)
(Freaking out)
