I can't touch you anymore,
I can't tell you how I feel,
as I fall, You would walk.
Heavy hearts do bury words
Under promises and "anything you wants," you'll have.
Like a body without warmth
Feels the blood arrest
and blackens from the cold, I'd cave
For kings and queens misunderstand
Heaven isn't held
but takes you by the hand, so I've found
I can't touch you anymore
I can't tell you how I feel
as I fall, You would walk.

Tame your thoughts and let me in
Break your callous ways and press me to your skin
Save a rose
