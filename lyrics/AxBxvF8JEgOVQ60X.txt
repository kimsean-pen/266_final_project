If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry, each time we meet
Walk on by

Walk on by
Make believe that you don't see the tears
Just let me grieve
In private, 'cause each time I see you, I break down and cry

Walk on by
(Don't stop)
Walk on by
(Don't stop)
Walk on by

I just can't get over losing you
And so if I seem broken and blue
Walk on by

Walk on by
Foolish pride
That's all that I have left, so let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye
Walk on by
(Don't stop)
Walk on by
(Don't stop)

Walk on by
(Don't stop)
Walk on...
oh ooooh oh oooooh oh.
Walk on by
Walk on by
Foolish pride
Tha't all that I have left, so let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye
Walk on by
(Don't stop)
Walk on by
(Don't stop)
Now you really gotta go, so walk on by
(don't stop)
Baby leave, you'll never see the tears I cry
(Don't stop)
Now you really gotta go, so walk on by
(Don't stop)
Baby leave, you'll never see the tears I cry
(Don't stop)
