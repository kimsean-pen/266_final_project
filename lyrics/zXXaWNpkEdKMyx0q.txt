Never even knew
what you meant to convey
You handed us a retrospect
'til you didn't have a thing to say
No one questions you
Even someone set out to do
Now it's nothing...
but dead and gone

Let's go

Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Better with a lie
than the world's ever seen
You wanted all the recognition
until you lost the means

No one talks to you
Even someone set out to do
Take a number... your time has come

Cause you're another one!
You're another soul to feed
To the man's machine!
To the man's machine!

My excuses lay me down
My emotions make me drown
My endeavor takes blame

At least I have a name
Cause you're another one!
You're another soul to feed
To the man's machine!
To the man's machine!
Cause you're another one
