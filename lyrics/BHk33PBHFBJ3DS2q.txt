(k. fowley/j. fox/j. jett)

Each night alone I dream
That I'm a rebel roller queen
I'll be a star that shines
I can make the whole world mine

Hollywood it feels so good
Hollywood it feels so good

Each day at home I scheme
For the fame and fortune dream
Gonna be a superstar
With my fancy clothes and cars

Hollywood it feels so good
Hollywood it feels so good

I can make it, make it, make it, make it
Cause I can take it, take it, take it, take it

Each time the radio plays
It tells of the golden days
Living fast on the go
Lets get on with the show yeah

Hollywood it feels so good
Hollywood it feels so good
