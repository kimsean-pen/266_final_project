Now certainly
We all recognize the extremely, extremely low probability
Of life, existing on the moon

(Hmm, hmm, alright)

Drinking again, drinking again
Bottles up, I'm in to win
But none of my friends, just me and this bottle
People say that I'm on, say that I'm off I wouldn't doubt it
If you were me free as a bird, flying over mountains

But, I don't know where I'm going
Where I'm going, it's all happening
I'm going, it's all happening

Hate what I see, hate what I see
I'm over it, I need me some change
Something to feel good
Get me on the level, hmm, hmm
No no, no need to cry, no need to cry
You straighten up, you're such an adult
Pay all your bills, bet you are a zombie

And you don't know where you're going
Where you're going, it's all happening
You're going, it's all happening
We're going, it's all
Happening
