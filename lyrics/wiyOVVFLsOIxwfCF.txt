Cross my fingers and I hope to God
I knock on wood and pray with all I've got
Cross my bow with a cannonball
I see the writing on the wall, hey

There's no map and there's no clue
Where to go and what to do?
Yea, who to dog, who to ride and who to hold?
Forever by your side
Forever by your side

Mary won't you call my name?
Mary won't you call my name?
Mary won't you call my?
Mary won't you call my?
Mary won't you call my name?

I fell into the hands of a rich man's daughter
She led me like a lamb no bother
To go and live inside a barn
On her daddy's 90 acre farm

Hide your daughters in the snow
And watch out for the undertow
Hold both hands against the door
And dig your feet into the floor

Tell ya, there's no map and there's no clue
Where to go and what to do?
Who to dog and who to ride and who to hold?
Forever by your side
Forever by your side

Mary won't you call my name?
Mary won't you call my name?
Mary won't you call my?
Mary won't you call my?
Mary won't you call my name?
