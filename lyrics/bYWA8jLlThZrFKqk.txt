It is cheesed with power
and the morality of which it goes mad
A lot of people became dogs having tied to the chain
Your happy there?

I want to be enjoying the life
though it will knock against a high wall hereafter
I'm already dead however I was saved with the rock

I swore I at that time.
I will walk life that shines highest
There is no fear.
It gets it over though there is a painful day too
Now let's go.
The wing expands and goes to look for freedom and the glory
The world that extends to the place waits surely for you

踊らないか?

I swore I at that time.
I will walk life that shines highest
There is no fear.
It gets it over though there is a painful day too
Now let's go.
The wing expands and goes to look for freedom and the glory
The world that extends to the place waits surely for you
