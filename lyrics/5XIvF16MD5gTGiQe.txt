Of all the needs
There are none that are imagined
Of all the fires that ever burn
ours was the only one of worth
Have you forgotten what we were like then?*
When the day came fat with an apple in its mouth*

It is no use to worry about time,
we know the length that we have lived
All the pastures and the ice and water*
The high roads that I have come to know

I would not want to be faster or greener than now*
