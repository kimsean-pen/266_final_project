I have known the arcane lore
On strange roads such visions met
That I have no fear nor concern
For hatred and obstacles of this world

By stone-shoed wanderer I am taught
My visions from fiery-eyed iron-armed chanter
I know how to fight, I know how to sing
I know how to bend, I know how to break

How to break
How to break

I've not grown weary on lengthy roads
On strange lands not gone astray
Such is the knowledge, knowledge cast in me
Such is the knowledge, such are the skills

I know how to fight
I know how to sing
I know the way

I know how to fight
I know how to sing
I know the way

If ruin is said to befall me
It has not come to pass
I conquered all who stood in my way
And drowned the snakes of death

Because of treason I now shall leave
Because of my blood burning my soul
And now I raise this flaming sword
Towards darkness, against everyone

I know how to fight
I know how to sing
I know the way

I know how to fight
I know how to sing
I know the way

I know how to fight
I know how to sing
I know the way
