It's who I am and what I feel
My life is automatic
Up in the air, it's what I breathe
And it is never static

Don't let it go, I just want to explode
This insanity eradicates my soul
My aggravation is a force beyond control
Take it to the limit, never look back
It's nonerratic, automatic
But can I save me from myself?

It's who I am and what I feel
My life is automatic
Up in the air, it's what I breathe
And it is never static
So lift me up and take me high
And make me everlasting
'Cause I am automatic

Your fragile destiny, a product of it all
Always feels like I'm losing my control
I walk the highways like a loner in the cold
So don't let go
But can I save me from myself?

It's who I am and what I feel
My life is automatic
Up in the air, it's what I breathe
And it is never static
So lift me up and take me high
And make me everlasting
'Cause I am automatic

My aggravation
The power of control
Bring it to the limit
Never look back
It's nonerratic
It is automatic

It's who I am and what I feel
My life is automatic
Up in the air, it's what I breathe
And it is never static
So lift me up and take me high
And make me everlasting
'Cause I am automatic

It's who I am and what I feel
My life is automatic
Up in the air, it's what I breathe
And it is never static
So lift me up and take me high
And make me everlasting
'Cause I am automatic
