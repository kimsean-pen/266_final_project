I wanted relief
From wanting
A moment beneath
Nothing at all

Just a cold wind
Gingham flap
The streak of the shore

Yes I fled him,
He who I had loved
Too much

Limits
Limits of desire

I listened for news
Of the road
I tried to love
But it keeps me home

Other lives droned
Far from the grass where I lay
Each eye stared out
The opposite way

Limits
Limits of desire
Limits
Limits of desire

Desire...

Is there no
Is there no
Limit?
Is there no
Is there no
Limit?
Is there no
Is there no
Limit?
Is there no
Is there no
Limit?
