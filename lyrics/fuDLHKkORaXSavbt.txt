Boy, you make me flip
I see your passing ship
Sail right up to me again, again
Boy, where have you been?
Will I see you again?
Let's meet at the library
Okay

Saw you from over a shoulder in a corner
With bunch of peeps that go to the high school
I remember when we were in the yellow building, never friends
Same hair, and the same old crew
The light blue, neon glowing, tippy toeing
Trying to spy without you knowing

Boy, you make me flip
I see your passing ship
Sail right up to me again
Boy, where have you been?
Will I see you again?
Let's meet at the library
Library, boy

Oh, let's meet there, okay?
Okay

Midnight
Room is filling, something spilled and
That's my phone that landed in it
The highlights
Where you been, what you're doing
Fancy college, paying dues?

No small talk
That's your only rule
And you said since you landed
You've been stranded
With the books, they for lend at

Boy, you make me flip
I see your passing ship
Sail right up to me again
Boy, where have you been?
Will I see you again?
Let's meet at the library
Library, boy
Let's meet there, okay? Okay
Okay? Okay
