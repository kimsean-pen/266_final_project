The hopeless came in the dark
the winners toil with all the answers
By the way what ya doin'
The dusty films of a fine charade
I'm messing with the soul untied
And all it takes you is anywhere

Farewell to those charming eyes
40 days till we rest again (Sit tight y'all)
40 days is a shame you know
Fade on till the summertime
I got to go
