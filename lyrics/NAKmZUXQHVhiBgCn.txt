I hear voices
We're woken from my sleep
I'm haunted by either faults, I grieve
If the earthquake stops
Buildings fall
I'm pulling pictures off
From our walls 'till you say
Here, here I am
Oh, and here, here I am!

Oh ooh
All the ghosts they float
Float around us
How they turned all our dreams into dust
This ain't your mother
but darling there was no spark left for us
We won the battle
but lost the war

and now I know that

Here, here I am

Oh, and here, here I am!
Oh, hard to believe
It's said and done
Hard to believe
It's not dead and gone
I want to believe
All is well that ends well
But I just can't convince myself
Can't touch the stars
Or make them shine
Fight the tide until the day we die
Can't touch the stars
Can't make them shine
But you know I'll try
Can't touch the stars
Or make them shine
Fight the tide until the day we die
Can't touch the stars
Can't make them shine
But you know I'll try
For you I'll try
