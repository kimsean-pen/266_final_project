Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
Some kind of majesty
Some chemical load

Some kind of metal, made up from glue
Some kind of plastic, I could wrap around you
The needy eat man-mades, they wear phony clothes
They sit with our picture up until they grow old

Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
Some kind of majesty
Some chemical load

Well, me, I like plastics and digital foils

Some kind of nature
Some kind of nature, some kind of soul

Oh Lord, forgive me
Some kind of mixture, some kind of gold
It's got to come and find us
All we are is dust

Some kind of metal, made up from glue
Some kind of plastic, I could wrap around you
The needy eat man-mades, they wear phony clothes
They sit with our picture up until they grow old

Some kind of nature
Some kind of nature, some kind of soul
Come from within us

Oh Lord, forgive me
Some kind of mixture, some kind of gold
It's got to come and find us
All we are is dust
