Your long distance van drive [?]
Feeling absolute heartache in the [?] way
So seasick and waiting for the storm to break
An absolute loser on the verge of something great
Just waiting, waiting, waiting for the storm to break

Your long distance drive are coming around the bend
Absolutely broken [?]
Your heart's sinking weighing the two sides of you
An absolute loser on the verge of something new
Just waiting, waiting, waiting for the storm to brew

Just waiting, waiting, waiting for the storm
Just waiting, waiting, waiting for the storm
Just waiting, waiting, waiting for the storm to break
