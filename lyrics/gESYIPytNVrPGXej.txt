Nothing's gonna change the way that it feels 'cause I'm falling in love again
Nothing's gonna change the way that it feels
Said nothing's gonna change the way that it feels 'cause I'm falling in love again
Nothing's gonna change the way that it feels
World moves quickly
When you're with me
Hearts get lost in
What we started
Nothing's gonna change the way that it feels 'cause I'm falling in love again
Nothing's gonna change the way that it feels
Said nothing's gonna change the way that it feels 'cause I'm falling in love again
Nothing's gonna change the way that it feels
So tell me if it's real, if it's real, where do we go
So tell me if it's real, if it's real, where do we go
So tell me if it's real, if it's real, if it's real
So tell me if it's real, if it's real, if it's real
