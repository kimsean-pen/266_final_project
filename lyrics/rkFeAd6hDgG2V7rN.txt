I'm always thinking, are you alright?
It's best to leave things like that alone
And I guess I hit a soft spot
A spot where your newfound friends can't go
And I sat on your table, my hands resembled heartbeats
I wonder if you're able to feel my body heat
I always feel your body heat

And I'm following your shoe marks
Wondering if you can make it home
And I'm guessing I'm not far off
Thinking that your drink had stained your clothes
You just wanna feel in place here
And I'll always understand
The statements we will make here
I never wanna fall in love again
