Wait
Where you say you've been?
Who you been with?
Where you say you're goin'?
Who you goin' with?

Keep me on my toes
Keep me in the know
Wait
Keep me in your skin
Keep me in your chest

I'll wait for it to start
I'll wait for it to end
Keep me on my toes
Keep me in the know
But when I looked at her, I thought of only you

If only there was proof I could use to show it's true
We were young
We were in our teens
It wasn't real love

Spent behind bars
Oh, it's sad to think
We just let it be
Prisoners of love

It's so
Easy for it to be
Something second-guessed
Easy to read
Don't let it become
A meaningless routine
It's meaningless to me
But when I looked at her, I thought of only you

If only there was proof I could use to show it's true
Just crash
Fall down
I'll wrap my arms around

You now
Just crash
It's our time now
To make this work second
Time around
We grew up
We worked & changed our ways
Just like wildfire
Been burning now for days
Tearing down those walls
Nothing's in our way
I said, nothing's in our way
& I know
I've said this all before
But opposites attract
We try & run away
But end up running back
& all I want to do
All I want to do is lie down
& crash
Fall down
I'll wrap my arms around
You now
Just crash
It's our time now
To make this work second
Time around
Oh, crash
Fall down
Just crash
Fall down
Just crash
Fall down
Just crash
Fall down
