What we need's a call to action

So long to what could never heal
So long to your distant memory
So long to what could never be

You build me up to break me down again
You kill me once you kill me every time
Your disbelief it keeps me waiting in line

I don't believe you're dull reaction

What we need's a call to action

So long to all your remedies
So long to your desperate misery
So long to what you think of me

You kill me once you kill me every time
Your disbelief it keeps me waiting in line

I don't believe you're dull reaction

Waiting in line, waiting in line

And at this moment I'm standing forward

I've tried it your way so how do you like me now?
Like me now
How do you like me now?
