I didn't put this dress on for you to take it off

It took me thirty minutes, just to pick out this dress
Another half an hour
To clean up the mess
Another twenty minutes just to do my makeup and you would wake up and dance with me
What's really going on

Why are you so afraid
When I'm pretty sure you can take it
Enjoy what you see
Cause you won't be seeing me naked
I didn't put this dress on for you to take it off
But since you left me right now

Oh we got one night
Oh we live one life
So don't let this moment slip away

There's a million lights
And they shine so bright
I would die if you walked away

Don't let me dance alone, I wanna dance with somebody
Don't let me dance alone

It took you twenty minutes
Just to come and say hi
How can you get it yourself
If you don't give it a try
I came here with my girls
I'm not leaving without them so you got me for one more song
Let's get it on

No money for a drink
Cause I spent it all on my dress
These bloody heels are killin' me
But they're the best
I didn't put this dress on for you to take it off
But since you left me right now

Oh we got one night
Oh we live one life
So don't let this moment slip away

There's a million lights
And they shine so bright
I would die if you walked away

Don't let me dance alone, I wanna dance with somebody
Don't let me dance alone

Something about the music I've been feelin' like I'm ready to blow
Don't leave me alone
Don't let me dance alone
Something about the music I've been feelin' like I'm ready to blow
Don't leave me alone
Don't let me dance alone

Don't let me dance alone

I didn't put this dress on for you to take it off
But since you left me right now

Oh we got one night
Oh we live one life
So don't let this moment slip away

There's a million lights
And they shine so bright
I would die if you walked away

Don't let me dance alone, I wanna dance with somebody
Don't let me dance alone
