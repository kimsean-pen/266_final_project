If my tongue is the blade
Then your hand is the gun
One of us ain't going home tonight

If my tongue is the blade
Then your hand is the gun
One of us ain't going home tonight

This is what fear tastes like
Go ahead and make me numb

No way around it, no one inside
I was never listening 'cause you were never right
Never right

You've got me wrong
How did we end up like this?
I've lost myself
Please, God, give me a chance
You've got me wrong
This is all so damn useless
I'm done with you
I'm done - this is so damn useless

I don't believe at all
That I'm the monster you make me

Don't understand it
Don't need your grace
You were never listening
To the words I said

You've got me wrong
How did we end up like this?
I've lost myself
Please, God, give me a chance
You've got me wrong
This is all so damn useless
I'm done with you
I'm done - this is so damn useless

If my tongue is the blade
Then your hand is the gun
One of us ain't going home tonight

You've got me wrong
How did we end up like this?
I've lost myself
Please, God, give me a chance
You've got me wrong
This is all so damn useless
I'm done with you
I'm done, this is so damn useless
