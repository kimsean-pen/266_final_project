I wanna tell you a story 'bout, 'bout this girl, mmm
I warn you she's everything you desire, just take my word

I was in the hotel lobby drinking all alone
She took me by the hand and away we go
She don't say a word and I can't say no
But I know she talking dirty in español
We were kissing all the way up and down the stairs
She bite my lip and she pulled my hair
I opened my eyes and she wasn't there

Ma-ma-ma-Maria, tell me have you seen her?
She's everything I want, want, want, want, want
But now she's go-o-one
Ma-ma-ma-Maria, tell me did I dream her?
She's everything I want, want, want, want, want
But now she's go-o-one
Ma-ma-ma-Maria, tell me have you seen her?

There's more to the story to talk about, 'bout that girl, mmm
She'll twist and she'll pull and she'll break you down 'til it hurts

I was in the hotel lobby drinking all alone
She took me by the hand and away we go
She don't say a word and I can't say no
But I know she talking dirty in español
We were kissing all the way up and down the stairs
She bite my lip and she pulled my hair
I opened my eyes and she wasn't there
All I got was her name

Ma-ma-ma-Maria, tell me have you seen her?
She's everything I want, want, want, want, want
But now she's go-o-one
Ma-ma-ma-Maria, tell me did I dream her?
She's everything I want, want, want, want, want
But now she's go-o-one
Ma-ma-ma-Maria, tell me have you seen her?
Ma-ma-ma-Maria, tell me have you seen her?

I know you're out there somewhere with somebody
I know you messed me up but I still love it
And every time I close my eyes, you didn't even say goodbye
Oh in my blood, in my veins, and all I got is your name

Ma-ma-ma-Maria, tell me have you seen her?
She's everything I want, want, want, want, want
But now she's go-o-one
Ma-ma-ma-Maria, tell me did I dream her?
She's everything I want, want, want, want, want
But now she's go-o-one

Ma-ma-ma-Maria, tell me did you see her?
Ma-ma-ma-Maria, she's gone
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone, she's gone, she's gone
Yeah she's gone, she's gone, gone, gone
