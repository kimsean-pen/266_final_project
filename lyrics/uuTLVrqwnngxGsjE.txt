Touch me baby
It feels so amazing (yeah)
And you stimulate me
And you make me want you more and more

What do I do, what do I say
Does it feel good, to you this way
I wanna be, all that you need
Boy what's your fantasy?
Better hold on, ready or not
Baby my love ain't gonna stop
Take it down low, make me get high

Ooh my love goes
On and on and on and on and on
My love goes
On and on and on and on and on
My love goes on
On and on and on and on and on
See, all my love's for you
On and on and on and on and on

Baby don't you rush me, no
You gotta take it slow
Just let the feeling grow
Until it overflows
Anyway you want it now
Just gotta tell me how
To give you everything
You've even dared to dream

Isn't it bliss, to you right now
Don't be subdued, say it out loud
Ain't it a sweet, luscious delight
When you're immersed in my
Ocean of love, coming on strong
Baby I've been waiting so long
Revel inside of paradise

Ooh my love goes
On and on and on and on and on (yeah)
On and on and on and on and on
My love goes
On and on and on and on and on
My love goes
On and on and on and on and on

So
Gimme some pure delectable love
Like I'm gonna give to you (I'm gonna give it to you)
Keep coming around
'Cause I won't run out
I can't get enough of you, my love goes on

Ooh there it goes
On and on and on and on and on
My love goes
On and on and on and on and on
My love goes
On and on and on and on and on
