I miss those blue eyes
How you kissed me at night
I miss the way we sleep
Like there's no sunrise
Like the taste of your smile
I miss the way we breathe

But I never told you
What I should have said
No, I never told you
I just held it in

And now I miss everything about you
I can't believe that I still want you
After all the things we've been through
I miss everything about you
Without you

I see your blue eyes
Every time I close mine
You make it hard to see
Where I belong to when I'm not around you
It's like I'm not with me

But I never told you
What I should have said
No I never told you
I just held it in

And now I miss everything about you (still you're gone)
I can't believe that I still want you (and I'm loving you, I never should have walked away)
After all the things we've been through (I know it's never gonna come again)
I miss everything about you
Without you

But I never told you
What I should have said
No I never told you
I just held it in

And now I miss everything about you (still you're gone)
Can't believe that I still want you (and I'm loving you, I never should have walked away)
After all the things we've been through (I know it's never gonna come again)
I miss everything about you
Without you
