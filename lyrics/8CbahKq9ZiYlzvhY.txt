What do you want?
With all the years behind me
Signs they do show
The feelings brand new
Pages do flow
It's no longer spring time
Seasons do change
But I'm still drowning in blue

No matter the way that I go
Or how hard that I try
No difference who's to my side
If that who is not you
And no matter the wind
What ever the ride
I stand still with time

Time used to fly 'til you walked out that door
The sand doesn't fall through our glass anymore
And my hands on the clock
We don't get around now I'm sure
My whole world stopped without you

Back in the day
I clearly remember
Strolling the shore
With time on our side
But it slipped away
Right through our fingers
But it's not too late
To turn back the page if I would be left behind

I'm saying that now that I'm older
And a little bit wiser
I look off of my shoulder
And see the best thing that's happened to me
Now I know that
Please let me show that
Love heals in time

Time used to fly 'til you walked out that door
The sand doesn't fall through our glass anymore
And my hands on the clock
We don't get around now I'm sure
My whole world stopped without you

No matter the way that I go
Or how hard that I try
No difference who is to my side
If that who is not you
And no matter the wind
What ever the ride
I stand still with time

Time used to fly 'til you walked out that door
The sand doesn't fall through our glass anymore
And my hands on the clock
We don't get around I'm sure
My whole world stopped without you

Without you
Without you
