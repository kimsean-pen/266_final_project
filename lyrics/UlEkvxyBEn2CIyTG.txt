Agony is the price that you'll pay in the end
Domination consumes you then calls you a friend
It's a twisted fall
Binds are like steel and manipulates the will to be
And it's hard to see
How soon we forget, when there's nothing else left to destroy
It's a useless ploy

Your eyes will see the dawn of the day
And the writing on the wall
Those words that stare into your soul
And to yourself you will befall

It's domination!
Pushed into living hell
Domination!
Yeah!

A now blacked heart is reaching out divinity
Body suspended by chains over razors and nails
It's a penalty
Each razor a vice and each nail marks the demise of you life
Grim construction grows
Has life played a trick sealed you in brick by brick, till your end
Forcing you to bend

Your eyes will see the dawn of the day
And the writing on the wall
Those words that stare into your soul
And to yourself you will befall

It's domination!
Pushed into living hell
Oh, domination!
