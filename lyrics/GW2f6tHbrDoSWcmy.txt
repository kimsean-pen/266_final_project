Honey bunny
My baby girl friend
Sweetheart
My sugar girl friend
Where are you
Eyes of blue dear
You are my
My everyday girl
And everyday, everyday
I think of your smile

Oh darling
You're my darling
I can take you away
I can wonder with you
Wonder everyday
And darling
I can see you
When I close my eyes
And in my dreams
You're always there
Darling you remember
The days we would spend
And happy the place
I could take you there

We're like dreamers
In nice colors
Childlike dreamers
Underwater

We're the dreamers
In nice colors
And the colors
Are like summer

On and on
On and on
On and on
Oh
