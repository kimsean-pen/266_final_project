I was running in and out of doors
And I was checking if I lied to all
I was waiting in the night alone
For you
For you, oooh

So come on closer
Don't you wanna
See inside my shell
So come on beat my silence
My ultraviolet
Sad? there's something to tell

And I was waiting for my fall
To come
Or just some message that you care at all
But there's somewhere from inside this home
From you
From you, oooh

So come on closer
Don't you wanna
See inside my shell
So come on beat my silence
My ultraviolet
Sad? there's something to tell

So come on closer
Don't you wanna
See inside my shell
So come on beat my silence
My ultraviolet
Sad? there's something to tell

So come on closer
Don't you wanna
See inside my shell
So come on beat my silence
My ultraviolet
Sad? there's something to tell
