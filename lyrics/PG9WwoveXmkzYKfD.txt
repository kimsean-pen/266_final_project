Take downs
Things sinkin' with a melody
Someone's gonna ask if you graduated
But as for you
Throw down

Isolated as far as you go
I'm well versed in the walls of worst
In the windows of most
Wind down

A.C.
Coast to coast
High cool 'cept when I lie with you
Naked on a southern love
Oh cool downs

Cool downs
Wise and prosperous
That I am
Flustered and erratic
'Cept when I lie with you
Naked on a southern love
Give downs
Rub downs
Lie downs
Any downs at all
Any downs at all
