Oh, you really got it good
Heave every cup of tea
For throwing back at me
The fact I take too long

When all my good is gone
I'll be on my way
Rewind and erase
When we're riding on, deciding
I could always look a hypocrite, baby
Pay no mind, you might call me

Oh, you really got it good
Disaster follows me
You and your family tree
You all are very wrong

When all my good is gone
I'll be on my way
Rewind and erase
When they're riding, non-deciding
I could always look a hypocrite, baby
Play your mind, you might call me

Simon said enough for years to come
Now I'm done for a while
Until I feel that I
Would like to try again
Don't think I'll try again
