I'm taking my time, it's a quarter to three
I'm clicking my heels
'Cause you know were runnin the show
I turn around, he lookin at me
An I'm looking at boy
Because you already know
Now we don't mess around, you see me with my crew
You love how we get down
You wanna do it too
We make a perfect team, and boy you know it's true
So if your wondering here's what we gonna do

We'll be buying out the bar, take over the club
I got what you want, so give it up
All my girls are don's, still it ain't enough
Took over the club
So tonight we gonna take over the world
Take over the world, take over the world

Can't get enough
So tonight we gonna take over the world
Baby are you rolling with me
Might wanna be on my team
'Cause tonight we gonna take over the world

Real close, grab my jeans
Start pulling me close, grind on me
Like you want it (want it), my body's like
A bottle so I flaunt it
Baby you need
To take me places where them boys hang up
We can move mountains, spend a couple hundred grand tonight
Who's coming, I ain't told you what it is
So baby make your move
'Cause when you make your mind, this is what we gonna do

We'll be buying out the bar, take over the club
I got what your want, so give it up
All my girls are don's, still it ain't enough
Took over the club
So tonight we gonna take over the world
Take over the world, take over the world

Can't get enough
So tonight we gonna take over the world
Baby are you rolling with me
Might wanna be on my team
'Cause tonight we gonna take over the world

The only thing missing is a miss's by your side
Baby I really want you rolling with me (I said)
Want it you can get it, boy just tell me what you like
Baby it ain't a problem
'Cause I get what I need, no it ain't no thing
Baby that's how it is, when you rolling with the queen
Don't pay attention to them haters that's behind us
And if they trippin' then tell em that they can find us

Buying out the bar, take over the club
I got what your want, so give it up
All my girls are don's, still it ain't enough
Took over the club
So tonight we gonna take over the world
Take over the world, take over the world

Can't get enough
So tonight we gonna take over the world
Baby are you rolling with me
Might wanna be on my team
'Cause tonight we gonna take over the world

Buying out the bar, take over the club

All my girls are don's, still it ain't enough
Took over the club
So tonight we gonna take over the world
Take over the world, take over the world

Can't get enough
So tonight we gonna take over the world
Baby are you rolling with me
Might wanna be on my team
'Cause tonight we gonna take over the world
