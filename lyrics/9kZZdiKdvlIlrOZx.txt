A week inside, I think I'm starting to show.
I told myself to keep myself in line.
Should we get married or just go on killing each other?
I don't think I hate you enough to commit you to me.
Happy all the time. It's all we ever do.
Steady in decline. It's all we ever do.
I'm sorry but it's true.
How can I save you when I couldn't save a dime.
I want to call you and tell you that I'm a fan.
All my friends know better but I can't quite hear them.
Still for the life of me I can't imagine our home.
Good things, that's all I want.
All I want for you.
Hold me. Set me free.
It's all I want from you.
It's sad and it's so true.
If you can't be the life of the party,
You'll be the death of everyone.
All I want is a life without parties.
Want you as one.
Watch this pot and it is sure to boil.
Sometimes I catch myself thinking,
"Boy, or girl?"
Kiss me on the teeth. It's all that we can do.
Punch me. Wake me up.
This lullaby is blue.
Lie and say we're through.
