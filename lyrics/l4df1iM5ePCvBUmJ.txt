Aah, ahh, aaah
Oooooo
Well I know that you're young
And I know you're naive
But you know that you got me sugar
Under your sleeve
But the way that you did me
And you're doing me still
I can't help but to wonder
Is your love for me real
Now you told me you love me
And you know who I am
And you said that you'd be with me
Time and again
But the time wasn't right
And you wanna have fun
Sugar please do your thing
Don't let me stop you then
Ooh but these games that you play
They must meet an end
Don't you know I won't be around
When you start bullshitin' baby
Oh the time will come for death do us part
And where will you be
Where will you be
Oh-oh-ooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-ooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh
Now there's love on your lips
And there's locks in your hair
In your heart in your mind
Sugar you got it there
No great god in the heavens would surely agree
That there is no other sister that's more worthy of me
Ooh but these games that you play
They must meet an end
Don't you know I won't be around
When you start bullshitin' baby
Oh the time will come for me to give my heart
And where will you be, yeah
Where will you be
Oh-oh-ooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh
Aahyeah, baby please, please, yeah, yeah
And where will you be
Where will you be-eeeh-eeeh
(I wanna know)
(What you doin')
(I'm comin' to you, baby)
