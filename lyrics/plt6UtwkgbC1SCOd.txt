The shore must be sinking
Or turtlelephant's rising up
the tides and tusks her shell of rust

Jaws to cut lumber now I'm grinding teeth
Great legs are pillars, have somehow given out

Thousands of birds lurking,
the shallow waters was still too far

I keep a mountain between us
So we can never touch
Hollowed out in the desert
Or in the trenches sinking
either way you'll meet the same fate
as A coal mine canary.
