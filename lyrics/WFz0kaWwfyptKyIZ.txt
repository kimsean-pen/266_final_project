It's a bit like drowning
Staring across a busy room at you
But you're ten miles away
Flying around above the ocean blue
A force of nature
Nothing can touch your white feathers
The stars and planets
Are calling to you in this crowded room

But you're already up there
From your chair to the open skies
But you never found a way to keep in time
You've got a blue blue ribbon
Trying to disguise your sad brown eyes
You can spend a lifetime
Playing a version of the real girl
Little paths through the thickets
Carry the weight that you can never show

To escape from everything
You flew out to sea so far

It's hard to ever come back
And the more we look for you
The further away you soar
Should you fall
How to ever catch you?
Oh, the most incredible views
And no one to talk about it to

It's not hard to see how
Someone you love is gonna mess you up
It's that hot-cold feeling
A fly in your drink, a little bell that rings
And if you dream in black and white
They say it means that you're a psycho
And if you feel those thoughts collide
Stretch out your wings and say goodbye

You're already up there
You flew out to sea so far

It's hard to ever come back
And the more we look for you
The further away you soar
Should you fall
How to ever catch you?
Oh, the most incredible views
But no one to talk about it to
