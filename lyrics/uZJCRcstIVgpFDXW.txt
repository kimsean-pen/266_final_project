An easy swing had its time shouldered
Slow bending axe
And now it's a photo framed
The swing hasn't had it

And here we are rebuilding roads
Right by roosting towns
It's just like the love
The one that's never been enough

So I'm counting on your fingers
'Cause you've reattached the twitch
And even if you want opinion
I would die along the ditches

And every summer is a heart talking
To the cold, cold take of lust
And every autumn singes
With the business of sadness

Our friend had it wrong
We sing "honey heaven burns"
Another curve in the counting
His head is earning more

So I'm counting on your fingers
'Cause you've reattached the twitch
And even if you want opinion
I would die along the ditches
