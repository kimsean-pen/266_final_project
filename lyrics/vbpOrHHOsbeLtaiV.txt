Okay let's keep this simple,
I do intend to live my life on the safe side
it's who i am and it's who you are.
I can, i can see you clearer when you're not lying underneath it all
and i can see your complexion,
and i know your heart the way you choose.
You always want the best for you,
now i'm standing here with crying eyes
I still see through your disguise.

I never meant for you to choose,
you should've known better;
there's nothing left for you to lose
when you looked at me and said you had it all but,
what you did is not unforgivable, unforgivable,
but what you did is not unforgivable.

I know things have been going on you know you can't erase your sin,
and now you can see your reflection.
I know that your heart is breaking
but is it as torn as mine, as mine, as mine, ohh?
You've already made it known how much you lie and what you've shown.

Everything inside my head won't leave me alone.
I never meant for you to choose,
you should've known better
There's nothing left for you to lose,
when you looked at me and said you had it all,
but what you did is not unforgivable, unforgivable.
What you did is not unforgivable, unforgivable.

And even though it's been so long
and now i know this is where i don't want to be.
And i know, something's not right
and now i'm telling you get off of me.
I never meant for you to choose,
meant for you to choose you should've known better.
There's nothing left for you to lose,
when you looked at me and said
you had it all, but what you did is not unforgivable!
What you did is not unforgivable, Ooohooo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
