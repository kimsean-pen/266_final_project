Dissolving in small oceans
Responsible for concentrating currents
To match a pulse in us that no longer exists
Resurfacing only when we're running out of air

Apprehensive from our absent-heartedness
Spitting blood from confidence confessed
Inducing dreams in which we never met to rid myself of regret
We were a pair of fragile limbs
Too weak to carry us to bed
Stretched so thin but somehow burning at both ends

Foreshadowing the pain of transferring dead weight
While we can barely stay awake
A self inflicted severance will seal our fate
Let it die, we had to let this die

Apprehensive from our absent-heartedness
Spitting blood from confidence confessed
We were a pair of fragile limbs
Too weak to carry us to bed
Stretched so thin but somehow burning at both ends

Dissolving in small oceans like the salt into our wounds
To match the pulse in us that no longer exists
We were a pair of fragile limbs
Too weak to carry us to bed
Stretched so thin but somehow burning at both ends
