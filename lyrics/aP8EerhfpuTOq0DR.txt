Purple skies and candy rain, candy rain.
Pink balloons and aeroplanes, aeroplanes.
I want your rainbow love love love, love love love.
I want your rainbow love love love.
Nadia, up in the club,
Who knew,
I'd fall in love?
He was on the dance floor,
Spazzing out.
He was so trashed,
So they kicked him out.
Took him out side,
And they fked him up.
Ran ran ran,
s~~, out of luck.
Now we're in the bathroom,
Passing out-ut-ut.
He was so ~~~~,
So I helped him out.
He said,
Purple skies and candy rain, candy rain.
Pink balloons and aeroplanes, aeroplanes.
I want your rainbow love love love, love love love.
I want your rainbow love love love.
I can see colours,
In my mind.
I can see colours,
In my mind.
I can see colours,
In my mind.
I can see colours,
In my mind.
And I see,
And I hear,
And I feel,
Rainbows in the sky.
I can touch,
I can taste,
I can feel.
Rainbows in the sky.
I can touch it,
Taste it.
Rainbows in the sky.
I can touch it,
Taste it still.

Rainbows in the sky.
Standing in the doorway,
Making out-ut-ut.
Girls in the bathroom,
Won't let me out-ut-ut.
Sucking on a lemon,
At the bar.
Never really cared,
Who you say you are.
'Cause,
I can see a rainbow,
Up in the clouds.
Club system,
Too f~~in' loud.
Purple skies and candy rain, candy rain.
Pink balloons and aeroplanes, aeroplanes.
I want your rainbow love love love, love love love.
I want your rainbow love love love.
I can see colours,
In my mind.
I can see colours,
In my mind.
I can see colours,
In my mind.
I can see colours,
In my mind.
And I see,
And I hear,
And I feel,
Rainbows in the sky.
I can touch,
I can taste,
I can feel.
Rainbows in the sky.
I can touch it,
Taste it.
Rainbows in the sky.
I can touch it,
Taste it still.
Rainbows in the sky.
Purple skies and candy rain, candy rain.
Pink balloons and aeroplanes, aeroplanes.
I want your rainbow love love love, love love love.
I want your rainbow love love love.
