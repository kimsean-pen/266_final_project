Oh, I never thought you'd hurt me, I guess you live and learn
That when you're playin' with fire, you're bound to get burned
Oh, I've been mistreated, I've been used before
I get kicked in the face still I come back for more
But I won't cry no more 'cause the tears are all in vain

We can pick up the pieces and start it all again
Let's just get back to the way it was before
Oh, girl I can't take anymore
Baby, don't treat me bad

This could be the best thing that you'll ever have
Baby, don't treat me bad
You can do anything but baby, don't treat me bad
Oh, don't treat me bad
I gave it everything but you threw it all away
I can't take anymore of these games that you play

Oh, I've been through heartache and I've been through pain
And it's hard to believe you still treat me this way
But I won't cry no more 'cause the tears are all in vain
We can pick up the pieces and start it all again

Let's just get back to the way it was before
Oh, girl I can't take anymore
Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, this could be the best thing that you'll ever have

Baby, don't treat me bad

You can do anything but baby, don't treat me bad
Oh, don't treat me bad

'Cause girl, I can't take anymore
Oh yeah
Now listen to me baby, don't treat me bad
Well, this could be the best thing that you'll ever have
Baby, don't treat me bad
You can do anything, but baby

Now listen to me baby, don't treat me bad
Well this could be the best thing that you'll ever have
Baby, don't treat me bad
You can do anything but baby, don't treat me bad
Don't treat me bad
Oh oh, yeah, don't treat me bad
No no, no no, no no
Don't treat me bad, don't treat me bad
