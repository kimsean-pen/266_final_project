Driving me on
With the wind in my back
There is no turning around now
Got my mind in check
Epiphany
As I hear it's call
While observing this cursed world
As it swallows us all

I see the light
Over my bleeding hands
But it's fading away now
Leaving my faith in strands
Epiphany
As I hear it's call
While observing this cursed world
As it swallows us all

So, rain
Come and wash away my fears
In these cold streets below
Before they rest on arms reversed
In my timewave zero
