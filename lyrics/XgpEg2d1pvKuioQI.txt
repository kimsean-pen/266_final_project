Mother,
I've gotta get out of here
So I can save our family
From this poverty
And when I make my money
I'll send it back to you

Father,
Give me strength, I pray
I have to end this misery
It's causing too much pain
I'm gonna look for richer lands
Where the money's made

I'm gonna put my whole World
In your hands
I have to put my whole World
In your hands
In your hands

Mister,
Please let me work somehow
You've kept me waiting 18 months
And still I'm not allowed
And every time you promise me:
"Not much longer now"

I've had to put my whole world
In your hands
I'm gonna put my whole world
In your hands
In your hands

Hey, hey, oho
Listen, listen to me

Mister! Mister! You say you're trying
But don't you know my brother's dying
You say "it won't be long"
But why am I so cursed
For where I am born?
I know

You've got my whole world
In your hands
I've had to put my whole world
In your hands
I'm gonna put my whole world
In your hands
I've had to put my whole world
In your hands
In your hands
