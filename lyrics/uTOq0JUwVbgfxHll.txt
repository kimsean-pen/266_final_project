Ain't got no trouble in my life,
No foolish dream to make me cry.
I'm never frightened or worried,
I know I'll always get by.
I heat up (I heat up)
I cool down (I cool down)
When something gets in my way I go round it.
Don't let life get me down
Gonna take life the way that I found it.

CHORUS
I got the music in me
I got the music in me
I got the music in me
I got the music in me
I got the music in me
I got the music in me

They say that life is a circle (circle)
But that ain't the way that I've found it.
Gonna move in a straight line (ooh)
Keeping my feet firmly on the ground.
I heat up (I heat up)
I cool down (I cool down)
I got words in my head so I say them.
Don't let life get me down,
Catch a hold of my blues and just play them.

CHORUS

Feel funky
Feel good
Gonna tell ya
I'm in the neighbourhood
Gonna fly like a bird on the wing
Hold on to your hat honey,
Sing, sing, sing, sing
Heat up, cool down (cool down)
I got words in my head so I say them
Don't let life get me down (Don't let it get ya down)
Catch a hold of my blues and just play them.

CHORUS 2x

Ain't got no trouble in my life,
No foolish dream to make me cry.
I'm never frightened I'm never worried,
I know, I know I'll always get by.

CHORUS 2x

I got the music
Pretty music
I got the music
In me

Don't let it get ya down
Don't let it get ya down
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get ya down
Don't let it get ya down
Don't let it get you down
Ha, ha, ha, ha

CHORUS

Don't let it get ya down
Don't let it get ya down
Don't let it get you down

I got the music in me
I got the music in me
I got the music in me
Don't let it get ya down
Don't let it get ya down
Don't let it get you down

(Repeat to fade)
