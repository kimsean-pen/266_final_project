Thing about love, is I never saw it coming
It kinda crept up and took me by surprise
And now there's a voice inside my heart that's got me wondering
Is this true? I wanna hear it one more time

Move in a little closer
Take it to a whisper
Get just a little louder
Say it again for me
Cause I love the way it feels when you are telling me that i'm the only one who blows
your mind
Say it again for me
It's like the whole world starts to listen when you tell me you're in love

Say it again

The thing about you is you know just how to get me

You talk about us like there's no end in sight
The thing about me is that I really wanna let you open the door and walk into my
life
Move in a little closer
Take it to a whisper
Get just a little louder
Say it again for me

Cause I love the way it feels when you are telling me that i'm the only one who blows
your mind
Say it again for me
It's like the whole world starts to listen when you tell me you're in love
And it feels like it's the first time
That anybody's ever brought the sun without the rain
And never in my whole life
Have I heard words as beautiful as when you say my name
Say it again for me
Cause I love the way it feels when you are telling me that i'm the only one who blows
your mind
Say it again for me
It's like the whole world starts to listen when you tell me you're in love
Say it again
Say it again
Say it again
Say it again
Say it again
Say it again
Say it again
Say it again
Say it again
When you tell me you're in love
Say it again
