I would like to wrap your hair round your neck like a noose
I would like to wrap your legs around my neck like a lock
You are my precious thing, thing of speed and beauty
You are my precious thing
As long as you remain beneath me

I will hold you down, I will hold you down
I will pin you down
I will hold you down, I will hold you down
I will punch down you

You are my precious thing
You are my precious thing
You are my precious thing

I will hold you down, I will hold you down
I will pin you down
I will hold you down, I will hold you down
I will pin you down
I will hold you down, I will hold you down
I will pound it down you

You are my precious thing, thing of speed and beauty
You are my precious thing
You are my precious thing, thing of speed and beauty
You are my precious thing, long as you remain beneath me
