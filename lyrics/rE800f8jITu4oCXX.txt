Torchlight dancing on her chamber, a flickering throne of bone
Embedded in walls of cobwebs
Entangled draping designs arachnid
Eyelessly her sockets piercing, a voice begins to rise
A torrent of backward screaming
The bandaging that wraps her bursting
As her legs begin to part
Foul plumage of dust erupting
Our lungs arrested by dreadful coughing

Her royal stomach bulbous, bubbling, bulging with undead life
A prayer to unknown and unsee these hellish sights

The halls of these catacombs our wretched grave
Where we'll stalk the dark as undead slaves
A sentence eternally to painfully rot
In this skull-lined tomb that time's forgot

Hallucination paralyzation
Utter and complete annihilation

Queen of the restless dead spews forth
Screaming as we're both eaten alive!

Spider sacks erupt
A million tiny princes
Pouring from her hollowed hull
Hungry for flesh

Cobwebbed mistress of ancient horror
The torch escaping my frozen grasp
Our end approaches carnivorous feasting
We'll feed her offspring, consumed before each other's eyes

The rancid fruitage of her ancient, yellowed bones
Had we only learned to leave well enough alone

The halls of these catacombs our wretched grave
Where we'll stalk the dark as undead slaves
A sentence eternally to bloodlessly rot
In this skull lined tomb that time's forgot

Chained in this afterlife, we're to remain
Serving unto this curse of everlasting arachnid disdain
A hecatomb by the candle's golden flame
Never must you utter her name

Hallucination paralyzation
Utter and complete annihilation
