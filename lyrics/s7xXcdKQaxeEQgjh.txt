Oh you make it look so easy
Your love came freely
She had her chances
Could leave it in the past there
She took advantage
She's taking it for granted
You know I try so hard
But I don't understand it

She loves to say "I'm free"
Let it be
Well if you change your mind about me

'Cause you look so sweet in the heat of summer
You drive me crazy me when your hands start to wander
You're lonely honey, can't you see what I see
If you love me baby you've gotta set it free

You're looking that way, I just can't stand it
I learned my lesson but you break it like a habit
Oh, you can run from me baby but you won't get far
Every time I close my eyes she will kiss me in the dark

But if you say you're gone
Let it be
Well if you change your mind about me

'Cause you look so sweet in the heat of summer
You drive me crazy me when your hands start to wander
You're lonely honey, can't you see what I see
If you love me baby you've gotta set it free

You look so sweet in the heat of summer
You drive me crazy me when your hands start to wander
You're lonely honey, can't you see what I see
If you love me baby you've gotta set it free

'Cause you look so sweet in the heat of summer
You drive me crazy me when your hands start to wander
You're lonely honey, can't you see what I see
If you love me baby you've gotta set it free
If you love me baby you've gotta set it free
