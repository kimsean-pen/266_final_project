The scent of lies is in the air tonight
The scent of lies is in the air tonight
The scent of lies is in the air tonight
We dance in a spell of lust, those eyes of yours I cannot trust
The scent of lies is in the air tonight
We dance in a spell of lust, those eyes of yours I cannot trust

You all act innocent but I have seen your true face
Stop lying to yourself; you're nothing but a fucking disgrace
You're a fucking disgrace
How can you trust anyone if you can't even trust your friends?
A masquerade of lies will kill us all in the end
The worst part of it all is I'm exactly the same
I'm looking around the room
I'll be the first one to blame

The scent of lies is in the air tonight
We dance in a spell of lust, those eyes of yours I cannot trust
The scent of lies is in the air tonight
We dance in a spell of lust, those eyes of yours I cannot trust

Take another look inside of yourself
Look at the mess you've made
Take another look inside of yourself
You're living in a masquerade
You're just a two-faced piece of shit
I'll make sure all you cowards quit
So hide yourself behind a mask
In a room of double faces you can never hide what's in your past

Nothing changes at all, I'm still exactly the same
I'm looking around the room
I'll be the first one to blame

The scent of lies is in the air tonight
We dance in a spell of lust, those eyes of yours I cannot trust
The scent of lies is in the air tonight
Those eyes, those eyes

To everyone who's held me up and everyone who's brought me down
I will never forget your faces, your voices
To everyone who's held me up and everyone who's brought me down
I will never forget your faces, your voices
Wink and smile for a while behind a mask
In a room of double faces you can never hide what's in your past
