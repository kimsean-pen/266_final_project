You make me walk away from the hate I carry
Same page, same ways, so effortlessly
I'll put faith in you, if you put faith in me
If we want it, it could be that easy
On top of the world
At the end of the world, with you
Don't ever hold back what you're saying to me
Don't ever restrain, just be
I never half-measure anything
If it's worth it to you, that's where I wanna be
On top of the world
At the end of the world, with you
On top of the world
At the end of the world, with you

There's nothing that can hold me back
Don't have "happy ever after"
Just have "here and now"
On the Samhain of our souls
Watch the world burn in fire
The bliss of your kiss in the apocalypse
On top of the world, at the end of the world
With you
On top of the world, at the end of the world
With you
On top of the world, at the end of the world
On top of the world, at the end of the world
On top of the world, at the end of the world
On top of the world, at the end of the world
With you!
