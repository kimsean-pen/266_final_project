I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down, my love

I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down, my love

Now, Nikki, she's got no flag to fly
But she don't seem that much to mind
No, she don't seem to mind

And you, you got your armor on
Lights out in Babylon
Yeah, lights out in Babylon

But maybe all you need is someone to trust
Maybe all you need is someone
Maybe all you need is someone to trust
Maybe all you need is someone

And I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down, my love

I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down, my love

No, I won't let you down (won't let you down)
Won't let you down (won't let you down)
Won't let you down (won't let you down)

No, I won't let you down (won't let you down)
Won't let you down (won't let you down)
Won't let you down (won't let you down)

Now Emily's got no tricks to try
But she don't seem that much to mind
She don't seem to mind that much to me

You got what the whole world wants
So strap that armor tighter on
Double on down and it's gonna make you free

Maybe all you need is someone to trust
Maybe all you need is someone
Maybe all you need is someone to trust
Maybe all you need is someone

I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down, my love

I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down, my love

No, I won't let you down (won't let you down)
Won't let you down (won't let you down)
Won't let you down (won't let you down)

No, I won't let you down (won't let you down)
Won't let you down (won't let you down)
Won't let you down (won't let you down)

I won't let you down, baby
I won't let you down, baby

I won't let, I won't let you down
I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down (won't let you down)
I won't let you down, my love (I won't let you down)
I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down (I won't let you down, my love)
I won't let you down, my love (I won't let you down, my love)
I won't let you down
I won't let you down (I won't let you)
No, I won't let you down (I won't let you, I won't let you down)
I won't let you down, my love (I won't let you down)
My love
