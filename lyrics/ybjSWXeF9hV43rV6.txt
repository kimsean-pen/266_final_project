I still remember, I was young
You put your hand on my shoulder
Then you were gone
I've been thinking lately
How it could have changed me
Oh, I wish you could see me now

Maybe I'm hopeless
But I'm only human
I hope that you know that I'd give it all for a moment with you

These cold hands
This burning heart
Will always be hollow without you
I lost you
But all the love you left behind
Will always remind me
Remind me of you

So many years have come and gone
But every picture without you still feels so wrong
I've been thinking lately
What would you say if you saw me?
Would you be proud of what I've become?

Oh, these cold hands
This burning heart
Will always be hollow without you
I lost you
But all the love you left behind
Will always remind me
Remind me of you

Maybe I'm hopeless
But I'm only human
I hope that you know that I'd give it all for a moment with you
Oh, maybe I'm hopeless
But I'm only human
I hope that you know that I'd give it all for a moment with you

These cold hands
This burning heart
Will always be hollow without you
I lost you
But all the love you left behind
Will always remind me
Remind me of you
