I've grown tired
of dreaming when I'm not sleeping

I'm not sure what brought you here
but I think you've overstayed your welcome
and I want you out of my head, out of my mind
'cause all I see is your face
every time I close my eyes

I've grown tired of
dreaming when I'm not sleeping
I want to be over you

pull
me backwards
as we both
fall into place

I tried to stay a step ahead
but it hangs me up when I know what's unsaid

you can only push someone so far
before they stop feeling anything at all
and I want you out of my head, out of my mind
'cause all I see is your face
every time I close my eyes

my mind is shutting down
but I still have so much to say
trying to tell you to leave
when I take the easy escape
so I breathe in my classic evasion
that pulls me off the ground
fixated on leaving

I've grown tired of
dreaming when I'm not sleeping
I want to be over you

I'm not sure what brought you here
but I think you've overstayed your welcome
