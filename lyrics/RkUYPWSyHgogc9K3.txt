In the doldrums of my life
I was nice to the people that I meet
But inside there was hate
Can you relate to the feelings that I preach?

If you're sure I know
The way to go
I'm sure it's all in your head
I'm cold, already dead
I'm cold, already dead

I, I saw in the distance
a freight train out of the mist
It was heading, it was rolling right at me

So I started running but I lose my breath
Too many cigarettes, I smoked me to death
And I will remember I can feel it all

If you're sure I know
The way to go
I'm sure it's all in your head
I'm cold, already dead
I'm cold, already dead

You died so long
So long ago
I'm alone up here on this stage
I'm cold, already dead
I'm cold, already dead
I'm cold, already dead
I'm cold, already dead
