Lost in my head, and I can't leave
Watching the rain, falling away
Away from me
Days grow cold as I grow old
Watching my life through a window
So I sit, watching the rain
And I can't leave

I wanna feel something
I wanna feel air that I can breathe
I'm tired of being nothing
I'm tired 'cause I don't want to be
Make believe

It happened again
I freed myself from words never said
This road with no end
And there's no help, ooh
Lost and lonely, strangers know me
Better than I know myself
So I sit, watching the rain
And here I'll stay

I wanna feel something
I wanna feel air that I can breathe
I'm tired of being nothing
I'm tired 'cause I don't want to be
Make believe

All we are is guilty hearts in this sea of memories
Time goes by and people cry
But I don't feel anything
All we are is guilty hearts in this sea of memories
Time goes by and people cry
But I don't feel anything

I wanna feel something
I wanna feel air that I can breathe
I'm tired of being nothing
I'm tired 'cause I don't want to be
I wanna feel something
I wanna feel air that I can breathe
I'm tired of being nothing
I'm tired 'cause I don't want to be
Make believe
