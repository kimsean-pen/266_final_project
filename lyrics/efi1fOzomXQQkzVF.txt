Some nights, I bolt and sleep in the car
From the hood, talk at your face in the stars
I tell you versions of everything
We share a smoke in the dark

I need you c-c-c-closer, Little Bulldozer

Wake up - I'm nowhere, drifting dead
(Keep inching forward you better find her)
I'm shot, I'm scratching snakes in my skin
(I want a fistfight, a cheap reminder)
I'm always answering everything
"When can I see you again?"

My little mischievous everything
My little shot in the dark
(I thought she wasn't coming
Almost gave up on waiting
So certain of disaster
I almost didn't ask her
But I did.)
