Impureness of the holy
Pureness of the unholy

The blame of betrayal and sorrow for regression
Dwells inside the heart of the sickened nation
Harvest the days of genocidal misery
Fathers killing sons for the oath of loyalty
Confess the broken oath you've praised
Spare the promises and lies you've embraced

Saints infected, heaven's infestation
Altars of venereal perversion
The flesh of disgust, enshrouded adoration
Forgive the acts of those from redemption

Blessed be the blade
Of the murdering priest

Not to blame the godfathers of mortal conspiracy
Annihilate, burn and despise, sons of their own breed
Anything for the glory and triumph of the crooked legacy
Servants die mutilated like pigs in a slaughterhouse

United in servitude
Spread the disease into the multitude
Contagious minds erosion
Serve the scriptures of illusion

Slay yourself for the glorious day
When the bell tolls for the sins you've made

The blame of betrayal and sorrow for regression
Dwells inside the heart of the sickened nation
Harvest the days of genocidal misery
Fathers killing sons for the oath of loyalty
Confess the broken oath you've praised
Spare the promises and lies you've embraced

Impureness of the holy
Pureness of the unholy

Weight of a colossal fraud
Smash the pillars of God
Slay yourself for the glorious day
When the bell tolls for the sins you've made
