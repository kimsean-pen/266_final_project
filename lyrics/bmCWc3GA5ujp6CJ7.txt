I cannot hold my tongue, you give me much to say
I'm sweating bullets, nervous that you'll push away
And when your eyes catch mine,
I know I talk too much
So give me your two lips
And baby, I'll shut up

Lying on the beach, the middle of December
I'm thinking you're too cool to even remember
My face, my hair, my eyes, my lips, and my name, hmm
Lighting up that clove, your confidence is what I want
I say a lot, I'm loud 'cause maybe you're the one
Your hair, your eyes, your lips, and your name, hmm, baby

I cannot hold my tongue, you give me much to say
I'm sweating bullets, nervous that you'll push away
And when your eyes catch mine
I know I talk too much
So give me your two lips
And baby, I'll shut up

Oh baby, I'll shut up
Oh baby, I'll shut up
Oh baby, I'll shut up
(Oh baby, I'll shut up)

You dress in all black, the middle of the summer
You're smoother than you think
You rock that Alex Turner
Your style, your arms, wrapped in leather
Makes me want you forever
(Oh, oh)
But I cannot break this habit, pure anxiety
Stuck here searching for some words that you might need
Maybe you don't need them
It's not what we're about
And maybe I'll just slow it down
Down, down, down, down

I cannot hold my tongue, you give me much to say
I'm sweating bullets, nervous that you'll push away
And when your eyes catch mine
I know I talk too much
So give me your two lips
And baby, I'll shut up

Oh baby, I'll shut up
Oh baby, I'll shut up
Oh baby, I'll shut up
(Oh baby, I'll shut up)
