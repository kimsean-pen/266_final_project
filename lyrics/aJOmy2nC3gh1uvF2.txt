I just don't believe
I'm ready for today
This paranoid pain is coming back again
Oh that picture Momma placed by the window
Oh how I hate my face

And there's people all outside
Behind the curtains silver lines
With all their lies
They're all like mine
all like mine
But when the wind blows
I'll go, I'll go

And I will be released
Break these chains set me free
And I will be released
Break these chains

I can think of brighter days
They were golden in a way
Words were not this grey
But now prices will be paid
When I walk in the path
Of all you guilty ones someday

Cause I cannot help my heart
When it's beating in the dark
Afraid next time I wont cry
I wont cry
And when the times change
I'll go away, I'm away

And I will be released
Break these chains set me free
And I will be released
Break these chains set me free

Like a pilot I will fly
way up in the sky
I'll be free
I'll be high high high
And I will be released
Break these chains
Break these chains

So I can be released
Praying on my knees
That I can be released
I can be released yeah
So I can be released
Praying on my knees
That I can be released
That I can be released

And I will be released
Break these chains set me free
And I will be released
Break these chains set me free

Like a pilot I will fly
way up in the sky
I'll be free
I'll be high high high
And I will be released
Break these chains
Break these chains

I can think of brighter days
They were golden in a way
Words were not this grey
But I can break these chains
