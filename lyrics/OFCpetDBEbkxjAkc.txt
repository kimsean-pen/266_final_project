I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
And if you ever say goodbye
If you ever even try

I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna love you more and more every day
I'm gonna love you more and more in every way
And if you ever say goodbye
If you ever even try

I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna tell my mama
Tell my papa too
So they'll know exactly what I'm gonna do
If you ever say goodbye
If you ever even try
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you

I'm gonna love you more and more every day
I'm gonna love you more and more in every way
And if you ever say goodbye
If you ever even try
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna tell my mama
Tell my papa too
So they'll know exactly what I'm gonna do
If you ever say goodbye
If you ever even try
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
