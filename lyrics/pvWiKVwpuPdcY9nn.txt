Fate will echo
Between the worlds
Through the shores of the
Fallen souls
To this land that I served with pride
Visions clear in the
Fading light
And we walk through the shadows of pain
Come and walk with me...
To the end!

All is condemned!
So

Walk to the end!

Free from regret!
Yet

Will I ascend to her?
Will I meet Morgana soon?
Will I meet Morgana soon?
Bodies wilt but the mind's serene...
For a life worthy of
Her grace...
My desire as I depart
Give my piece back to her
Lone heart...
To the end!

All is condemned!
So

Walk to the end!

Free from regret!
Yet

Will I ascend to her?
Will I meet Morgana soon?
Will I meet Morgana soon?
I have to run through
The shadows of hate
To be hers
Again!
To the end!

All is condemned!
So

Walk to the end!

Free from regret!
So

Walk to the end!
All is condemned!
So

Walk to the end!

Free from regret!
Yet
Will I ascend to her?
Will I meet Morgana soon?
Will I meet Morgana soon?
