Your slim frame
Your eager eyes and your wild mane
Oh, they keep me where I belong
All wrapped up in wrong

You're to blame
For wasted words of sad refrain
Oh, let them take me where they may
Believe me when I say

I will be your accident if you will be my ambulance
And I will be your screech and crash if you will be my crutch and cast
And I will be your one more time if you will be my one last chance
Oh oh, fall for me

Your slim frame
Your simple stare and your wrong, wrong name
Oh, they keep me where I belong
All strung out in song

Why so tame?
We could shoot wilder vines through younger veins
Sip slow from night's deep wells
And watch our gardens swell
Once the seeds are sown
Wild and overgrown, you'll see
Heart's colors changed like leaves

Oh sweet, sweet tree, fall for me
Fall fast, fall free, fall for me

Because I will be your ambulance if you will be my accident
And I will be your screech and crash if you will be my crutch and cast
And I will be your one more time if you will be my one last chance

Oh sweet tree, fall with me
Fall fast, fall free, fall with me
