The lights are always or red
The radio man sits on one diamond
I turn around, and I see your face
That reminds me of you

The blossom comes, it quickly goes
Those animals, they assume they're all
And nature finds a way to take it home
Whoever you are
I need to touch your skin
To know I'm alive

And all my dreams wrapped up in you
All my dreams wrapped up with you
All my dreams...
You're all my dreams

I keep playing a song
Come on, let's get up, get on
Life's too shorts just to fade away
Don't talk of gettin' old

You still look out there and smile
You got that grace and that smile now, honey
I wanna just live tonight
And to find our way home
I wave back to that special love
The one you must call

And all my dreams (wrapped up in you)
You're all my dreams (wrapped up with you)
You're all my dreams (wrapped up with you)
You're all my dreams...
You're all my dreams...
You're all my dreams, now
You're all my dreams
And I'm gone, my life

Ooh, it's alright
'Cause it feels right
