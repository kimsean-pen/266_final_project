She left her books, her car, her clothes, and a note
But all she wrote was, "Tonight I'm leaving on a train."
She says she's headed west
To make it right for one more night
And, well, I don't blame her if she is
But he thinks it's just one more sunset
And after all, it's her fault
If she hasn't caught on yet

So why'd you have to go?
Is there something I could say to make you turn around?
Cause nights like these I wish I'd said don't go
Is there anybody there?
Can anybody help to get me out of here?
Cause you're walking down a road that I can't go

Try as I might
I just can't handle this
I lost myself inside a drunken kiss
And I, all that I wanted was to walk you home
Save a sad song for the sing-along
Oh my God, I just can't handle this
I lost myself inside a drunken kiss
And I, all that I wanted was to walk you home
Save a sad song for the sing-along

And she thinks she'll be my tourniquet
As the record on my stereo
Plays her favorite song for two whole days
And the drag streched out for miles and miles
And what she'd give for one more smile
And how she hoped he missed her
Cause, God, she missed how he would kiss her

Yeah, you're walking down a road that I can't go
Yeah, you're walking down a road that I can't
