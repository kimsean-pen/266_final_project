Secret
Secret

I've got a secret and I can't explain
All the time I've waited for this day
All along I was never in doubt
I've always knew it could ever get out
There are things that I cannot tell
And there are things that you know damn well
This is getting very hard for me
I guess you'd better just wait and see

Shut up
This is all
This is all
Secret

You brought a message and the message was clear
All the time you wipe away that tear
All I want is to hold your hand
To see the sun and walk the sand
You make me sad as you make me glad
And now you see all my secret is is love (Is love)

Everyday I'm always there
You comfort me
And make me feel it's worth my while
And then I look around and you're not there
And every day you say you can't hang out beware

Secret
This is all
This is all
Secret

I got a secret and I can't explain
Is this all
All I want is to hold your hand
Is this all
All along I was never in doubt
Is this all
To see the sun and to walk the sand
Is this all Secret
I got a secret and I can't explain
All I want is to hold your hand
