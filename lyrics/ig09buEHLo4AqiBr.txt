One afternoon
A part of me parted too soon
It slipped away
I don't know what to say
Eyes that drew me in
To wonderful, wonderful sin
And it blew me away
I don't know what to say

In answer
Nothing matters to me

One cold grey afternoon
A part of me parted too soon
And it blew me away
I don't know what to say
Eyes that drew me in
To wonderful, wonderful sin
And it blew me away

In answer
Nothing matters to me
Believe me
You own my soul completely

And from day to day
And from hour to hour
I will be
Always in your power
Set my spirit free

As I fell to the ground
My head swam around and around
And I didn't know
Which way was up or down
One cold grey afternoon
A part of me parted too soon
It slipped away
I don't know what to say

In answer, in answer
You're all that matters to me
