I don't wanna lose myself
Lose myself

We used to drive down the west side
Honda 92, that's my first ride
Walk into Sevan's with no ID
Barely 16, cop the 40 (Yeah)

Left my city in a rush (In a rush)
Didn't look back, gave you up (I gave you up)
Now I see my name in the lights (In the lights)
But it's still dark inside

I don't wanna lose myself
Lose myself

We used to sleep in a closet (Yeah)
E-40 on repeat (On repeat)
Sippin' boba in the sunset
Now you won't look at me (Yeah)

Left my city in a rush (In a rush)
Didn't look back, gave you up (I gave you up)
Now I see my name in the lights (In the lights)
But it's still dark inside

I don't wanna lose myself
Lose myself
To this, to this, to this

I just wanna feel something
Took a long time to clear my head
I just wanna feel something
I lost my love

Lose myself, myself, myself
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Lose myself, myself, myself
Oh no no

If I lose it all
Will you look for me?
If I lose it all
Meet me back at Ocean Beach
