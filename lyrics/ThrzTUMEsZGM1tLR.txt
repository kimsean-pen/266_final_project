We were rich once
Before your head exploded
Imagine doing just what the Big Bang did
The whole world
Knew it was loaded
Wave bye-bye 'cause it ain't ever coming down now

I just wanna get along (2x)

I look up
The heads fly over
I see a boy I know: his hair's on fire
The whole world I discovered
If you're so special why aren't you dead

I just wanna get along (3x)

Wave bye-bye 'cause it ain't never coming down now

I just wanna get along (3x)
