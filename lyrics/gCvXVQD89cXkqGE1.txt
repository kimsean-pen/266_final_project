I tell the truth, my words my bond, my word's the word of God
That Holy Light, that Holy Light, coming up and down from all sides
And hell is white, and hell is white,
and hell is white, and hell is white
Twin brother of Jesus, couldn't even know, "Everybody dies alone"
But if you wanna see me baby just you let me know
And hit me up before I go
Twin brother of Jesus, twin brother of Jesus Christ
Twin brother of Jesus, twin brother of Jesus Christ
Twin brother of Jesus, twin brother of Jesus Christ
Twin brother of Jesus, twin brother of Jesus Christ
Do you think that much about me
How it was or what it could be
Do you want me to lay hands upon your door
Should I even talk about it
Did yoy ever really doubt it
When I told you I was coming back for more
Woe to you whom in the flesh - Woe, for that's where you perish
And hell is white, and hell is white,
I said hell is white, Oh Lord it's white
Twin brother of Jesus, couldn't even know, "Everybody dies alone"
But if you wanna see me baby just you let me know
And hit me up before I go
Do you think that much about me
How it was or what it could be
Do you want me to lay hands upon your door
Should I even talk about it
Did you ever really doubt it
When I told you I was coming back for more
Twin brother of Jesus, twin brother of Jesus,
twin brother of Jesus,
twin brother of Jesus, twin brother of Jesus Christ
