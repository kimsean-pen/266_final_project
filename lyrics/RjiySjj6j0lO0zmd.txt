Baby baby it's late and you'd better go,
It's after three
Honey please have a heart, just look at that snow,
Take pity on me.
I can hear that north wind blowing,
And the fire is oh so warm
Well I know you should be going,
But how can I send you out in that storm

Baby its cold out there, and it's getting colder
Baby it's cold out there, getting colder
Matter of fact better cuddle up here
It's the coldest night of the year

Baby baby I know if you wanted to,
You'd brave the snow
But I haven't been well I might catch the flu
Or a cold in my nose
Lets snuggle close together
While the whole world turns to ice
Just the victims of the weather
Sending you home now just wouldn't be nice

Baby its cold out there, and it's getting colder
Baby it's cold out there, getting colder
Matter of fact better cuddle up here
It's the coldest night of the year
Ok? Why not.
