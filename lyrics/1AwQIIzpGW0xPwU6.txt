Choke, tried to wash you down with something strong
Dry but the taste of blood remains (of blood remains)
Cold, empty mattresses and falling stars
My, how they start to look the same

So keep in happiness and torture me while I tell you "Let's go in style"
A million hooks around, a million ways to die
Darling, it's cold outside

No, no more eyes to see the sun (to see the sun)
You slide into bed while I get drunk
Slow conversations with a gun
Mean more than I've ever said to anyone, anyone

So keep in happiness and torture me while I tell you "Let's go in style"
A million hooks around, a million ways to die
Darling, let's go inside
It'll be alright

But last night, you said you ended up in Palm Springs dancing on tables
Almost fought some bitch at the club (yeah!)
Got kicked out of your hotel and lost your shoes
Well, fuck, what am I supposed to be, impressed?
You're just another set of bones to lay to rest
I guess it's time to say goodnight
Hope you had a really good time, good time

I will soon forget the color of your eyes and you'll forget mine

So keep in happiness and torture me while I tell you "Let's go in style"
A million hooks around, a million ways to die
Let's go outside
It'll be alright

But last night, you said you ended up in Palm Springs dancing on tables
