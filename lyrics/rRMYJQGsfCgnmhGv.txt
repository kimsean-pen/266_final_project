Remote places where we'll go.
Without a doubt
I don't think the stars are symbols.
But let's find out.
And here we go
Up
Into the
Stars.

Inside the pyramid, deeper in it,
Hidden exit after Osiris.
All the stars are swords, I've never been so sure.

But 'til then we'll be hanging on the wall,
All our faces will be boomerangs hanging on the wall.
All the trees started to walk and all the rivers started to talk,
But only through digital manipulation.
