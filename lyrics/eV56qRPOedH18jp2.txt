Nothing's standing in my way
"Clear the room" I heard them say
Status legendary
Rest can leave, you can stay

Always on the edge of greatness but seem to take a fall
On the bench but feeling like a starter after all
You don't wanna be the one that says
"I told you so"
You may not get what you want, but you'll get what you're sold

In the mourning, you'll need a miracle
In the past, you were satirical
Oh I'm a winner
And I'm the winner
And the winner takes it all

I know that you will find your way
Better place, better days
But while you're living in the rain
Here's a coup de main

Always on the edge of greatness but seem to take a fall
On the bench but feeling like a starter after all
You don't wanna be the one that says
"I told you so"
You may not get what you want, but you'll get what you're sold

In the mourning, you'll need a miracle
In the past, you were satirical
Oh I'm a winner
And I'm the winner
And the winner takes it all

In the mourning, you'll need a miracle
In the past, you were satirical
Oh I'm a winner
And I'm the winner
And the winner takes it all

Oh, in the mourning, you'll need a miracle
In the past, you were satirical
Oh I'm a winner
And I'm the winner
And the winner takes it all
