I'm scared to find out
What eighteen's about
I'm about to jump now
I spend my money
And now I'm lonely again
But I can't slow down

Take me on a ride
So I don't, I don't feel invisible
Anywhere tonight
So I don't, I don't fade away
Need to feel alive
'Cause I'm lost and I wanna be invincible
Take me on a ride, ride, ride

It hurts to be eighteen
We're stuck in the in between
Restless and in the streets
Yeah, it hurts to be eighteen

I'm undiscovered
Heart's uncovered, scared
Of being let down
I know my mother
Taught me better
No calling back now

Take me on a ride
So I don't, I don't feel invisible
Anywhere tonight
So I don't, I don't fade away
Need to feel alive
'Cause I'm lost and I wanna be invincible
Take me on a ride, ride, ride

It hurts to be eighteen
We're stuck in the in between
Restless and in the streets
Yeah, it hurts to be eighteen

Who am I to decide who I'm supposed to be?
I need time, I need time to be young and free
Who am I to decide who I'm supposed to be?
I need time, I need time

It hurts to be eighteen
We're stuck in the in between
Restless and in the streets
Yeah, it hurts to be eighteen

It hurts
It hurts
We're stuck in the in between
It hurts to be eighteen
