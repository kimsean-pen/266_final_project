My other car is your face
It drives me wild to see you out again

My other house is your mouth
I come inside and make myself at home

This is the big one
This is the big one

This is the big one
This is the big one

What has become of my life?
I'm stretched out, the big things and keeping tight

I call you every night
I'm shackled on your inside

This is the big one
This is the big one
I know it when I see it
This is the big one
This is the big one

It looks good

And we like the sound
And we like the sound
And we like the sound
And we like...
