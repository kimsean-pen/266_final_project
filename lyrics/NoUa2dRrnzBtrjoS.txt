X-girlfriend, you can't have him
It's about time that you found you a new man
He's moved on, don't you know, don't you know
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go

X-girlfriend, you don't listen
Stop trying, he's not gonna give in
He's not yours anymore, don't you know
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go

Hey x-girlfriend, it's too bad when you had him
Your thing didn't work
But he's all mine now, so stop pursuin' him
Before you get your feelings hurt

See our love is hot and no, it won't stop
'Cause I got him on lock
And although he rejects you, it don't seem to affect you
'Cause you just keep trying to get with him

So don't, don't keep, keep calling, hanging up the phone
When I answer I know, it tears you up inside
And why do you sit in silence on the other end
'Till I hang up and you predictably call right back again

X-girlfriend, you can't have him
It's about time that you found you a new man
He's moved on, don't you know, don't you know
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go

X-girlfriend, you don't listen
Stop trying, he's not gonna give in
He's not yours anymore, don't you know
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go

Hey x-girlfriend, whatever your name is
I'm really not amused
'Cause the things you do are very offensive
And sometimes straight up rude

All those late night calls and notes on his car
Won't get you anywhere
You can call his mom as much as you want
And he won't really care

So don't, don't keep, keep calling, hanging up the phone
When I answer I know, it tears you up inside
And why do you sit in silence on the other end
'Till I hang up and you predictably call right back again

X-girlfriend, you can't have him
It's about time that you found you a new man
He's moved, on don't you know, don't you know
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go

X-girlfriend, you don't listen
Stop trying, he's not gonna give in
He's not yours anymore, don't you know
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go

I understand why you want him back
But you need to know, our love's too strong
For you to penetrate
It's too late, His not your baby no more

X-girlfriend, x-girlfriend, it's time to let him go
X-girlfriend, don't listen
X-girlfriend, see he's not gonna give in

X-girlfriend, you can't have him
It's about time that you found you a new man
He's moved on, don't you know, don't you know
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go

X-girlfriend, you don't listen
Stop trying, he's not gonna give in
He's not yours anymore, don't you know
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go

X-girlfriend, you can't have him
It's about time that you found you a new man
He's moved on, don't you know, don't you know
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go
X-girlfriend, you don't listen
Stop trying, he's not gonna give in
He's not yours anymore, don't you know
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go
X-girlfriend, you can't have him
It's about time that you found you a new man
He's moved on, don't you know, don't you know
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go
X-girlfriend, you don't listen
Stop trying, he's not gonna give in
He's not yours anymore, don't you know
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go
