I can be your weak, I can be your powerful
My emotions' taking a hold of me
Put myself in get sentimental
Call it what you want, this is what you get
Leave this moment, breathe the future

This is who I am, am am, who I am
(This is who) This is who I am, am am, who I am
No more games, or dis-believing
This is who I am, am am, who I am
(This is who) This is who I am, am am, who I am
Stop there, analyze your feelings

You can be sure, you should believe me
I have nothing to hide from you
I would never deceive you, if I were a mask
You still can see me through
I will never turn into something I'm not!

This is who I am, am am, who I am
(This is who) This is who I am, am am, who I am
No more games, or dis-believing
This is who I am, am am, who I am
(This is who) This is who I am, am am, who I am
Stop there, analyze your feelings

And now we need to compromise,
We both need to sacrifice
Lower the guard, remove our defenses

There's nothing we can over done
Now that all the doubts are gone
Love sets us free!
This is who I am, am am, who I am!
This is who I am, am am, who I am!

This is who I am, am am, who I am
(This is who)This is who I am, am am, who I am
No more games, or dis-believing
This is who I am, am am, who I am
(This is who) This is who I am, am am, who I am
Stop there, analyze your feelings

This is who I am, am am, who I am
(This is who)This is who I am, am am, who I am
No more games, or dis-believing
This is who I am, am am, who I am
(This is who) This is who I am, am am, who I am
Stop there, analyze your feelings
