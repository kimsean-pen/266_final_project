Now that you're settled
Comes a knock at the door
Wind's rattling something
That never rattled before
What have we if not promises?
The excitement of the road too gets old

Something has changed in me
Changed again
Something has changed in me
And here I go
On the road again
Seeking another storm
Just when I think I've got it right
I hear the laughter of life
Something has changed

How many times we've pledged forever
Gone overnight like the weather
Magic days of childhood I took for granted
Now I see were held together by a thread

Something has changed in me
Changed again
Something has changed in me
And here I am
On the run again
Seeking another storm
Just when I think I've got it right
I hear the laughter of life

How many times can a person begin again?
The road getting stranger with every turn
Nature flaunting her beauty and indifference
Smears away our love with a smile
Something has changed
