yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I got something in motion
Something you can't see
It requires devotion
from those who truly believe
This is something you can't touch
This is something you feel
For some people it's too much
For some people it heals
This music is my healing
This music is my healing
Lord knows I need some healing
'cause this world upsets me, this music sets me free, yeah
We stand in formation
while they test and they see
They compile information
to try to make us believe
that there is something we can't touch
something we'll never feel
When I feel like it's too much
this music always reveals
This is our healing
This music is our healing
Lord knows we need some healing, yeah,
'cause in this world upsets me, this music sets me free.
God only knows, who will save us
who will save us now
They sit back and watch flowers turn to stone
We got this, we got this music (healer)
We got this music (healer)
We got this music, (healer)
We got this, we got this
