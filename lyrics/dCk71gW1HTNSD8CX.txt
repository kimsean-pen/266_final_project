Destination unknown

I left my job, my boss, my car and my home
I'm leaving for a destination I still don't know
Somewhere nobody must have duties at home
And if you like this, you can follow me
So let's go

Follow me
And let's go
To the place where we belong
And leave our troubles at home
Come with me
We can go
To a paradise of love and joy
A destination unknown

Now I won't feel those heavy shoulders no more
My life got better now I finally enjoy
Yes all the people wanna come here and so
Come on and join us you can do that now
Let's go

Follow me
And let's go
To the place where we belong
And leave our troubles at home
Come with me
We can go
To a paradise of love and joy
A destination unknown
Unknown
Destination unknown
Destination unknown
Follow me
And let's go

Follow me
And let's go
To the place where we belong
And leave our troubles at home
Come with me
We can go
To a paradise of love and joy
A destination unknown
