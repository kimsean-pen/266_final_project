I often wonder if we met today
Would you even recognize my face?
We could talk through our demons with steps retraced
Help me to understand your space
All I saw for years was red
Focus my gaze, time elapsed
Pen hits the page and I regret the act
Nine years of writing so angry, misguided

Echoes in the canyon sing
I don't owe you anything
It's done between you and me
Echoes in the canyon sing
You don't over her anything

You don't owe her anything

You buried me, submerged the seed

You buried me, submerged the seed
A lesson learned never again will I go down so easily

Tough to break through venom you spewed
What did you do? Tell me the truth
Manipulation in the guise of a mother

Some things can never be yours to take
To force forgiveness harbours pain like no other
My hands remain steady inside I shake

Echoes in the canyon sing
I don't owe you anything
It's done between you and me
Echoes in the canyon sing
You don't over her anything
You don't owe her anything
Echoes in the canyon sing
I don't owe you anything
It's done between you and me
Echoes in the canyon sing
You don't over her anything
You don't owe her anything, anything
Echoes in the canyon sing
I don't owe you anything
It's done between you and me
Echoes in the canyon sing
You don't over her anything
You don't owe her anything, anything
