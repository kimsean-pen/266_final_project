I woke up from the same dream:
Falling backwards, falling backwards
'Til it turned me inside out.
Now I live a waking life
Of looking backwards, looking backwards;
A model citizen of doubt.
Until one day I had enough
Of this exercise of trust.
I leaned in and let it hurt,
And let my body feel the dirt.
When I break pattern, I break ground.
I rebuild when I break down.
I wake up more awake than I've ever been before.
Still I'm pinned under the weight
Of what I believed would keep me safe.
So show me where my armor ends,
Show me where my skin begins.
Like a final puzzle piece
It all makes perfect sense to me...
The heaviness that I hold in my heart belongs to gravity.
The heaviness that I hold in my heart's been crushing me.
I've been worried all my life,
A nervous wreck most of the time.
I've always been afraid of heights,
Of falling backwards, falling backwards.
I've been worried all my life.
'Til one day I had enough
Of this exercise of trust.
I leaned in and let it hurt,
Let my body feel the dirt.
When I break pattern, I break ground.
I rebuild when I break down.
I wake up more awake than I've ever been before.
Still I'm pinned under the weight
Of what I believed would keep me safe.
So show me where my armor ends,
Show me where my skin begins.
Like a final puzzle piece,
It all makes perfect sense to me...
The heaviness that I hold in my heart belongs to gravity.
The heaviness in my heart belongs to gravity.
