Release!

How can I see you wanna sit down
With all this funk going on?
A-just playing right in your chair
Like you're not even here

Just give it a little push
Go on and let yourself get loose
Take that funk inside of you
And make your body move

Get up
Time to release the beast
Get up
Get up
Time to release the beast
Get up

Time is right to do it tonight
To get down on the wall
Everybody get in the groove
We're about to have some fun

You gotta give a little push
Just give it up on the floor
All I wanna do is dance with you
Gonna funk your mind some more

Get up
Time to release the beast
Get up
Everybody get up
Get up
Time to release the beast
Get up
Everybody get up

Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Everybody get up

Release!

Music's got me wanting to say
Hey! Everybody get up
Don't you want to get up out your chair?
Music's got me wanting to say
Hey! Everybody get up

Everybody get up
Don't you want to get up out your chair?
Music's got me wanting to say
Hey! Everybody get up
Don't you want to get up out your chair?
Music's got me wanting to say
Hey! Everybody get up

Get up
Time to release the beast
Get up
Everybody get up
Get up
Time to release the beast
Get up
