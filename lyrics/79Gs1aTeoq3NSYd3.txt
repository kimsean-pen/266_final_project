Loose and guilty and whipped
Sterility persecutes and I have plenty
Bruised and nailed and quit
Merciful and mourned and meek

Jealousy sows rejection with a kiss
In silken palms that tear bone from skin

To find a place where
I became untethered

This joke sport severs
I endeavoured
To find a place where
I became untethered

Jealousy sows rejection with a kiss
In silken palms that tear bone from skin

This Joke Sport Severed
I endeavoured
To find a place where
I became untethered
