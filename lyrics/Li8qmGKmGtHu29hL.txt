The death, the lies, in lies the truth
All that it is, what was, ain't true
I was down but now I can see
The pain, the hurt, the misery

Oh Lord, it's been a long time
Doing my best I'll try and get it next time
Oh Lord, it's been a long time
Doing my best I'll try and get it next time

This cross you bear, I've come to carry for you
This cross you bear, I've come to break it in two
I was down but now I can see
The pain, the hurt, the misery

Oh Lord, it's been a long time
Doing my best I'll try and get it next time
Oh Lord, it's been a long time
Doing my best I'll try and get it next time

Oh Lord, it's been a long time
Doing my best I'll try and get it next time
Oh Lord, it's been a long time
Doing my best I'll try and get it next time

Oh Lord, it's been a long time
Doing my best I'll try and get it next time
Oh Lord, it's been a long time
Doing my best I'll try and get it next time
