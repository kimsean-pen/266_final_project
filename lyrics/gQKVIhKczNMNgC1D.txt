Motherly love
Motherly love
Forget about
The brotherly and other-ly love
Motherly love
Is just the thing for you
You know your mothers' gonna love ya
Till ya don't know what to do

The mothers got love
That'll drive ya mad
They're ravin' 'bout the way we do
No need to feel lonely...
No need to feel sad,
If we ever get a hold on you
What you need is...

Motherly love
(come on get it now)
Motherly love
Forget about
The brotherly and other-ly love
Motherly love
Is just the thing for you
You know your mothers' gonna love ya
Till ya don't know what to do

Nature's been good
To this here band
Don't ever think we're shy
Send us up some little groupies
And we'll take their hands
And rock 'em till they sweat and cry
What you need is...

Motherly love

Motherly love
Forget about
The brotherly and other-ly love
Motherly love
Is just the thing for you
You know your mothers' gonna love ya
Till ya don't know what to do
We can love ya
Till ya have a heart attack
You'd best believe that's true
We'll bite your neck
And scratch your back
Till you don't know what to do
What you need is...

Motherly love
Motherly love
Forget about
The brotherly and other-ly love
Motherly love
Is just the thing for you
You know your mothers' gonna love ya
Till ya don't know what to do

You know I've got a little motherly love for you baby
You know I've got a little motherly love for you honey
You know it doesn't bother me at all
That you're only 18 years old
'cause I got a little motherly love for you baby
