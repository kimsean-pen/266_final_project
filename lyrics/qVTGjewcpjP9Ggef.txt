Banned in D.C. with a thousand other places to go
gonna swim across the atlantic 'cause that's the only thing i can do
you, you can't hurt me
why? i'm banned in D.C.
We, we've got ourselves
gonna stretch it gonna work it out to any other length
not worried not worried about what the other people are gonna say
we got ourselves, we're gonna make it anyways
you can't hurt me
why i'm banned in D.C., D.C.

upon the ground
so soon no more
