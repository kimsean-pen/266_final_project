My heart ticks in beat with these kids that I grew up with
Living like life's going out of style
And you came to watch us play
Like a "Big shot talent," but at the end of the day you know
(WHOOOA) we come from and where we call home (WHOOOA)
Hey Chris, you were our only friend

And I know this seems belated, but we love you back
They'll say it's not worth it

so we'll leave this town in ruin
Living like life's going out of style
You came to watch us play (to watch us play)
...like a "Big shot talent," but at the end of the day you know
Those busted lips, we take back home
Hey Chris, you were our only friend

And I know this seems belated, but we love you back
Sooo
Hey Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this seems belated, but we love you back
I know you would be there either way

So glad it seems like these times will never fade
I know you would be there either way
So glad it seems like these times will never fade
Hey Chris, you were our only friend

And I know this seems belated, but we love you back
Hey Chris, you were our only friend (our only friend)
And I know this seems belated, but we love you back
I know you would be there either way
So glad it seems like these times will never fade
Hey Chris, you were our only friend.
And I know this seems belated, but we love you back (we love you back)
