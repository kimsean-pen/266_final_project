Do you mind if I stroke you up (I don't mind)
Do you mind if I stroke you down (I don't mind)
All through the night (I don't mind)
Until your body's tired (I don't mind)
Do you mind if I stroke you up (I don't mind)
Do you mind if I stroke you down (I don't mind)
All through the night (I don't mind)
Makin' you feel so right (I don't mind)

C'mon in and close the door
I've got what you're looking for
Dim the lights, unplug the phone
And turn the radio on
I've got what you need
Just put your trust in me
And I won't let you down
So give me your love right now

Give it up (That's what I wanna do)
Keep it comin' (Don't stop)
I've got a question for you

Do you mind if I stroke you up (I don't mind)
Do you mind if I stroke you down (I don't mind)
All through the night (I don't mind)
Until your body's tired (I don't mind)
Do you mind if I stroke you up (I don't mind)
Do you mind if I stroke you down (I don't mind)
All through the night (I don't mind)
Makin' you feel so right (I don't mind)

I know the things to do
To make you feel alright
Giving you all of me
And keepin' you satisfied
Boy there's no mystery
You know how I feel right now
I want to lift you up
And make your love come down

Give it up (That's what I wanna do)
Keep it comin' (Don't stop)
I've got a question for you

Do you mind if I stroke you up (I don't mind)
Do you mind if I stroke you down (I don't mind)
All through the night (I don't mind)
Until your body's tired (I don't mind)
Do you mind if I stroke you up (I don't mind)
Do you mind if I stroke you down (I don't mind)
All through the night (I don't mind)
Makin' you feel so right (I don't mind)

Give it up (That's what I wanna do)
Keep it comin' (Don't stop)
I've got a question for you

Do you mind if I?
(Oh yeah baby)
Does it feel good?
(Yea)
Come On
