It's not the sun in the sky
That shines on me when I cry
It's not the one we all can see
The one that lives in me

I'm afraid of never finding her on time!
Gonna pray I'll never die the nightmare has begun
Uh!

Enter the Metal World of doom!
Into the hands of the machines
Enter the metal world of doom!
Beware the killer jaws of steel

It's not the black moon that heard my lonely calls
And turned my wish into a curse
Someone I love lies underground
I hear the voice inside
Build me alive!

I'm afraid of never finding her on time
Gonna pray I'll never die
The nightmare has begun

Enter the metal world of doom!
Into the hands of the machines
Enter the Metal World of doom!
Beware the killer jaws of steel

(Whoaaaa ooooh . oooh whoaaaa oooh)

I see a monster in her eyes
The monster claims I'm her kind
Obsessed with immortality fight an unseen enemy
Ooow

I'm afraid of never finding her on time
Gonna pray I'll never die
The nightmare has beguuuuuun!

Enter the metal world of doom!
Into the hands of the machines
Enter the metal world of doom!
Beware the killer jaws of steel

Enter the metal world of doom!
Into the hands of the machines
Enter the metal world of doom!
Beware the killer jaws of steel
