I'm running in menace!*

You wake these thoughts inside me and we're running out of time
I don't need any reason, what you may search you'll find

You're blind - when I'm around
I'm behind - you're going down

See you in Toky out in the city - you will never walk away from me
See you in Tokyo if you dare you will fight til the end when I'm gone, do believe
I'm running in menace!

You trade your life for diamonds under all these city lights
You'll never see the sun rise fulfilling my delights

It is time - when I'm around
How I have tried - you're going down

See you in Toky out in the city - you will never walk away from me
See you in Tokyo if you dare you will fight til the end when I'm gone, do believe
I'm running in menace!
