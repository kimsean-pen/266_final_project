You
The edge of your skin is a cliff over my heart
Where do they come apart?
Connected by the fall
A calm crashed onto me
Conductivity

I follow with a blind hum
Someone new
I follow with a blind hum
Someone new
More like you

I'm in your landscape
And I don't want to go back to mine
Back...

I look around for a plot to claim
Build a home, and have it all
There's nothing here but walls walls walls walls walls...
