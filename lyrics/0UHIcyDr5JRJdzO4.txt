A sudden kiss of the mother
Habondia, when the bell is heard
Appears to me as a vision
A journey to hill of Brakulla

The chrism of Hekate
The sacred oil
Io
Unguentum Sabbati

The oil of Pan
Io
Pan Noctifer

I see a torch I will follow
To meet the lord of the Venusberg
I bring a gift to the master
And to the hag of the
Garden Hedge, Hagzissa

Come
Black man of the Sabbath
O great god Pan
Io
Unguentum Sabbati

The oil of Pan
Come
Pan Noctifer

A silent sip from the cauldron
I disappear in the astral world
A dance with gods in Blakulla
The ecstasy of the dreaming cult

Chrism of Hekate
The sacred oil
Io
Unguentum Sabbati

The oil of Pan
Come
Lord of the Venusberg

O great god Pan
Bring
Chrism of Hekate
