My car radio's playing a song
That makes me feel very strange
It's taken so long
Through the gradation of the grey scale
A landscape like I've never seen
As far as my eyes can see
Out on the road
I've seen so many shades, shades of grey
Now I'm back in the tunnel again
Every minute, every second
I can feel it getting closer
Speeding ahead
To where grey meets white
