In the back of my mind,
well I fought my god
'cause all of the hell that's in my time.
But I can still see the birds
and where they went this year.
Our winter made things hazy
and I know that I was losing site of my hometown,
and in my blacking out
I think I let you down.
Don't let them try to save me
'cause I'm already crazy.

And there is something in your face
that pulls me far enough away.

I guess that I always knew that I'd find you

when I thought that I'd be letting out my darkest now,
and in my climbing out I think I let you live.
I wish you'd try to save me,
your silence makes me crazy.
It takes a lot to say that something is fate,
I kind of know where you're headed.

Am I too up front, or am I just on time?
Well where is your head at?

And there is something in your face
that pulls me far enough away.
I guess that I always knew that I'd find you
when I thought I reached my point,

I let them down.
I slept in the worst part of this town.
You are my song and you are where I wanna be.

I want to take those steps I never have.
I need to stand up straight
so I can feel your breath.
I really think for once that I can change.
It's really not that bad.
I'm learning now that I was wrong in everything
and that's the reason why I think that I can grow.
It's really not that bad.
It's in the way you had,
it's in the way you had me all wrapped up
like I'm a part of something finally,
and I'm never looking back.
