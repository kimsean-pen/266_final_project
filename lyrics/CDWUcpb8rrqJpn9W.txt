It seems like yesterday that my world fell from the sky
It seems like yesterday I didn't know how hard I could cry
It feels like tomorrow I may not get by
But I will try
I will try
Wipe the tears from my eyes

I'm beautifully broken
And I don't mind if you know it
I'm beautifully broken
And I don't care if I show it

Everyday is a new day
I'm reminded of my past
Every time there's another storm
I know that it won't last
Every moment I'm filled with hope 'cause I get another chance
But I will try
I will try
Got nothing left to hide

I'm beautifully broken
And I don't mind if you know it
I'm beautifully broken
And I don't care if i show it

Without the highs and the lows
Where would we go
Where would we go

I'm beautifully broken
And I don't mind if you know it
I'm beautifully broken
And I don't care if i show it

I, I am beautifully broken
I am beautifully broken
I'm beautifully broken
And I don't care if i show it
