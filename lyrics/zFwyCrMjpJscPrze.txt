These words I scream out loud
They vanish in the wind
And winters weight upon us
Has buried the life I knew

Life as on the walls
Has turned into the past
You know that I will wander
Through wind and rain, to ease my pain

I've seen my soul fall down
Sinking right into the past
Erasing all the signs of hope
Sweetness dies
Can never last

The scattered taste of death
Gets closer to my mouth
And the smell of blood
Lies thicker in the air
Than what it used to be
When you were still around
It's time for me to go
It's time to leave it's all I know
