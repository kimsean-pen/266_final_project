I'm halfway home, at the pub on the corner of the street
I see kids from school, but I stare down at my feet
Sports on TV

They scream for victory
A few blocks down, there's Dawn, she's got spinach on her teeth
In between the front ones, just a little bitty leaf
And I try to speak
But Dawn makes me nervous
And I get overexcited
Can't do a damn thing about it
My god, we're shoulder to shoulder
Nice guy looking for a future lover

The pet shop's closed, too bad, 'cause animals like me back
We had a dog once, we all just called her Kat
Was mum's idea
She's got a great sense of humor
Later tonight, some soup, then I'll probably send a text
"Hey Dawn, it's Jim. Would you like to have some sex?
And if that's too weird
Maybe just a hot chocolate"

I get so overexcited
Can't do a damn thing about it
My god, we're shoulder to shoulder
Nice guy looking for a future lover

Future, future love
Future love
Future love
Future love
Hey, hey, hey
Future love
Future love
Future love

I get so overexcited
Can't do a damn thing about it
My god, we're shoulder to shoulder
Nice guy looking for a future lover
'Cause I'm bored, bored, bored
Everybody knows it's hard living with mother (and your father)
If you can even call this living

Here's the ride cymbal
Nothing makes a man feel more alive
Than when they're tanging the hump of the ride
Tang the hump
Everyone knows it's humpin' living on ride cymbals
If you can even call that drumming
