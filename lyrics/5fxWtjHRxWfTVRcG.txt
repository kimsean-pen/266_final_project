My broken heart the world forgot
I keep your picture with me, Betty
I hold this grief I cannot speak
The words are in my throat, oh

I walked until Cathedral Hill
Brought me down into the city
And all that pain, it went away
The day I saw your face

It's midnight on Main Street
And this town's all asleep
But you're still here with me
And I know that

Darling your loves like witchcraft (witchcraft)
Oh, its witchcraft (witchcraft)
Oh, its witchcraft (witchcraft)
Yea, its witchcraft

If I don't have you by my side
I'll dream of you everynight
If I don't have you by my side
I can't live I wanna die

It's midnight on Main Street
And this town's all asleep
But you're still here with me
And I know that

It's midnight on Main Street
And this town's all asleep
But you're still here with me
And I know that

Darling your loves like witchcraft (witchcraft)
Oh, its witchcraft (witchcraft)
Oh, its witchcraft (witchcraft)
Yea, its witchcraft
