Everything's right, everything's wrong
When you call my name
I can't handle the thought of always being gone
When I'm wearing this ring
And I want to go out, I want to get drunk
Being in love and I don't want to fight
But nothing makes sense anymore

And I don't think I can stop the jealousy
When it comes, it comes like waves and I can't breathe
And I don't think I can stop the jealousy
When it runs, it runs like lightening through my teeth

I want you to tell me what to do
I want you to tell me what you need
When you look at me like you do
Don't leave, I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

And everything's right, everything's wrong
When you calling my name
All the hands on the clock keep moving along
While we're staying the same
I don't want to go out, I want to get drunk
And litter my lungs, and I know it ain't right
But nothing makes sense anymore

And I don't think I can stop the jealousy
When it comes, it comes like waves and I can't breathe
And I don't think I can stop the jealousy
When it runs, it runs like lightening through my teeth

I want you to tell me what to do
I want you to tell me what you need
When you look at me like you do
Don't leave, I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

And I don't think I can stop the jealousy
When it comes, it comes like waves and I can't breathe

I want you to tell me what to do
I want you to tell me what you need
When you look at me like you do
Don't leave, I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
