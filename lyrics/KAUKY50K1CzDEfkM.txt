Move Up!
To a different sound
To a higher ground
To a different key
With a melody
As the feeling grows
With the lights down low
When you hear the cry
Taste the alibi

Questioned once again
Drink the soothing cup
Said the liquid friend
Choose the rush to all

Move Up!
Kiss a tear goodbye
Cry a distant cry
Dance a daring dance
Take a 1-0 chance
Take your grasp on fate
Rise to heaven's gate
Stand above the rest
And take the lasting test
