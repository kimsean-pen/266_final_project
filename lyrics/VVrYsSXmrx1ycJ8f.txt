Do the D.A.N.C.E,
1, 2, 3, 4 Fight!
Stick to the B.E.A.T,
Get ready to ignite

You were such a P.Y.T (pretty young thing)
Catching all the lights
Just easy as A.B.C
That's how you make it right!

Do the D.A.N.C.E,
Stick to the B.E.A.T,
Just easy as A.B.C

Do the dance,
Do the dance!

The way you move is a mystery,
Do the dance,
You're always there for music and me.

Working day and night,
Whatever happens,
Do the dance,
Do the dance!
