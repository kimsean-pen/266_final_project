Drivel Head wears her glad rags
She's got her keys, money and fags
I know that her mind is made up
To get rocked.

Drivel Head needs a new man
As only a drivel head can
He's a hormonal nightmare
So beware.

Another victim of line up in line
Line up in line is all I remember.
Oh, how their favours change
You could have been kinder.
Yes, yes, line up in line
Line up in line is all I remember.
Oh, how their favours change
You could have been mine, uh

Drivel Head knows all the stars
Loves to suck their shining guitars
They've all been right up her stairs
Do you care?
Drivel Head knows all the bands

Knows them like the back of her hands.
You can't see the wood for the trees
On your knees.
