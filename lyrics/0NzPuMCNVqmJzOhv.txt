Hope,
A new beginning
Time,
Time to start living

Like just before we died

There's no going back
To the place
We started from

Hurt,
Falling through fingers
Trust,
Trust in the feeling

There's something left inside

There's no going back
To the place
We started from

Ah
All secrets known...

Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah

Calm,
All wounds are healing
Strong,
Truth is worth saving

I want to feel alive

There's no going back
To the place
We started from

All secrets known
Ah
All secrets known
