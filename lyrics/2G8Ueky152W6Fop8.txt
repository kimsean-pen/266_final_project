I've drained my heart, I've burned my soul.
I've trained the core to stop my growth.
I pray to die in space,
to cover me in snow,
to cover me in snow,
cover me in snow,

cover me in snow.
I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.
I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.
I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.
I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.
I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.
I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.
I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.

Take this from me.
Hate me. Hate me.
Take this from me.
Hate me. Hate me.
