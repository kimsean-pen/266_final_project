In this moment synchronized inside
Words that paint a legacy of life
A different picture will unfold
A healing finds it's way through

Sifted times, I take another breath
With an ambiance of nothing left
So heal my heart, rain down your love
These waters bring me back to life

Father, healer
Deliver me from broken love
Stay here closer
Let me hear your voice of love

There's a healing calling from the wind
There's a healer waiting to begin
In timeless places, traced and faceless
Will I learn to let go

Take me to the heights where love controls
Far away from home but feels so close
This empty heart of mine
Will fall inside and bring me back to life

Father, healer
Deliver me from broken love
Stay here closer
Let me hear your voice of love

You can hold
You can mend
You can heal
You can break, I hold there's something etched this way

Father, healer
Deliver me from broken love
Stay here closer
Let me hear your voice of love
Savior, redeemer
Bring me to this place of peace
Jesus, guardian
My broken heart is so in need
