I am a desperate attempt at putting my exhaustion into words
Cut my tongue out of my mouth
It's about as useless as my lungs

I have nothing left in me to give
I am a monument
For those who live and breathe in empty space

Put a fucking bullet in my head
And dig your feet into my back before you leave
Murder me and my intentions or bury me alive
Fill my lungs with dirt and watch the light drain from my eyes

Fold me in half like the blank pages that will taunt me to my face
Words like razors aimed directly at my wrists and now I speak

I have nothing left in me to give
Words like razors aimed directly at my wrists and now I speak
I have nothing left in me to give
Tie my lies around my throat until I finally tell the truth
I have nothing left in me to give
Words like razors aimed directly at my wrists and now I speak
I have nothing left in me to give
This is my eulogy, don't pretend to miss me when I'm gone
