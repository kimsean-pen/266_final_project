Yeah, ballad of a dead soulja
This is the ballad of a dead soulja
This is the ballad of a dead soulja
Come play the ballad of a dead soulja

The plan
to take command of the whole family
Though underhanded
to be the man it was planned
all my road doggs
official mob figures
love to act up
the first to bomb when we rob niggaz
I could be
lost in my own mind
to be the boss only thoughts
grippin chrome nines
niggaz get tossed up
war scars battle field memories
swore saw the devil in my empty glass of Hennessey
talking to a nigga on a tight leash
screaming fuck the police
as I ride through the night streets
little child running wild
towards his danger
what's the cause
don't be alarmed death to all strangers
maybe I'm a mad man
a pistol grabbing nigga
unleash the sand man
promise a merciless retaliation
nothing is colder
close your eyes

hear the ballad of a dead soulja

(Thug for Life I will lead)
Its just the ballad of a dead soulja
(A Life of Crime I will lead)
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soulja
(If you play the game you play to win)
This just the ballad of a dead soulja

(it's a crazy world full of sin)
Close your eyes

Completely lost
revenge at all costs
pay backs a bitch
switch now the tricks crossed
tossed up and never to be heard of
a single witness screaming bloody murder, murder
blast
tell me homey what ya see now
a blind man and a dead body
I'm meant to leave town
And get my cash though
up wit Kastro
Homey had to blast on the task force
Stupid coppers tryin' to play us out
'member that
they took my money and my stash
time to get it them back
haha
I pull my secret arrival
2Pac four fives (.45) time for survival
death to my rivals
tell me what you want lord?
Nobody laugh after the death of a drug lord
haha

the situations critical
Nothing is colder
than hear the ballad of a dead souja

(Thug for Life I will lead)
Its just the ballad of a dead soulja
(A Life of Crime I will lead)
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soulja

(If you play the game you play to win)
This just the ballad of a dead soulja
(it's a crazy world full of sin)
Close your eyes

Be a coward put your hands to the moon
when my glocks rang out
them niggas came out
BOOM
who wanna see me in a challenge
so merciless I'm terrifying niggas in my ballad
do u feel me?
capo or capi-tan
one day ill be the Don
until then I remain strong
my only fear of death is reincarnation
busting at my adversaries like a mental patient
To all my niggaz facing sixty years
Sheding tattoo tears
another suicidal on the tier
take a private plane
trying to survive the game
for all my homies that'll never be alive again
All they promised us is death nigga

take a breath could be the last one left nigga
its real now, uh
feel it and fantasize
ain't nothing colder
listen you can hear it, the ballad of a dead soulja

(Thug for Life I will lead)
Its just the ballad of a dead soulja

(A Life of Crime I will lead)
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soulja
(If you play the game you play to win)
This just the ballad of a dead soulja
(it's a crazy world full of sin)
Close your eyes

This go out to Kato 'n Mental
(This is the ballad of the dead soulja)
All the niggaz that have passed away
(Close your eyes, Ballad of a Dead Souljah)
Mutulu, Geronimo, Seyku
All the down ass ridahz
All the niggaz that put it down
All the souljaz
All the niggaz that go through that day to day struggle
(This is the ballad of the dead soulja)
All the niggaz that passed on
All the niggaz with ambition and money in their heart
All the niggaz want some and that dont take none, hahaha
(This is the ballad of the dead soulja)
The police is so scared of us
All the feds, they aware of us
They wanna see us dead
They got pictures of a nigga hit
(Ballad of the dead soulja)
Try and see me in chains
Shit, them niggaz will never breath again
Before they put me in a cell they'll see me in hell
(Cos this Ballad of the dead soulja)
Got my pistols cocked
Run the whole mutha fucken block
Fuck the cops
The police? We run these streets nigga
(And this Ballad of the dead soulja)
Heh, these niggaz cant see me
Half the world wanna be me
Multi-millionare
Shit, it ain't fair
But nigga-you know
It's the ballad of a dead soulja
