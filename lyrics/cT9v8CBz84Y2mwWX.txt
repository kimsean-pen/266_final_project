Oh the city's alight with lovers and lies
Bright blue eyes
Oh the city is bright
It's brighter than day tonight

Surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender

Sadie said she couldn't work out
What it was all about and so she let go
Now Sadie's on the street
And the people she meets you know

She tried to be a good girl and a good wife
Raise a good family, lead a good life
It's not good enough
She got herself up on the forty eighth floor
Gotta find out, find out what she's living for

Surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender

Tonight oh, the city's afire a passionate flame
It knows me by name oh, the city's desire
To take me for more and more, it's in the street
Getting under my feet, it's in the air, it's everywhere I look for you

It's in the things I do and say
If I wanna live I gotta
Die to myself someday

Papa sing my, sing my, sing my song
Papa sing my, sing my, sing my song
Papa sing my, sing my, sing my song
Papa sing my, sing my, sing my song

Surrender, surrender
Surrender, surrender
