I feel safe, I feel warm
When you're here
When I do no wrong
I am cured, when I'm by your side

I'm alright, alright

I am safe, when I am with you
And I feel warm if you want me to
I am cured, when I'm by your side

I'm alright

Careful where you stand, my love
Careful where you lay your head
It's true, we're always looking out for one another

I feel safe, when I am with you
I feel warm, when you want me to
I am cured when you are around

I'm alright

Careful where you stand, my love
Careful where you lay your head
It's true we're always looking out for one another

So I'd like a quiet time, please
Yeah, I'd like a quiet time
Careful where you stand
Now, careful where you stand
