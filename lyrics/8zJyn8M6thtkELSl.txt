Why I should feel this way
Why I should feel this way
Why I should feel the same
Something I cannot say
Something I cannot say
Something I can't explain
I feel you outside
At the edge of my life
I see you walk by
At the edge of my sight
Why I should follow my heart
Why I should follow my heart
Why I should fall apart
Why I should follow my dreams
Why I should follow my dreams
Why I should be at peace
I feel you outside
At the edge of my life
I see you walk by
At the edge of my sight
I had to let you go
To the setting sun
I had to let you go
And find a way back home
I had to let you go
To the setting sun
I had to let you go
And find a way back home
(When I dream, I see you)
(When I dream, I see you)
I've never seen a light that's so bright
I've never seen a light that's so bright
I've never seen a light that's so bright
Blinded by the light that's inside
Blinded by the light that's inside
Blinded by the light that's inside you
I had to let you go
To the setting sun
I had to let you go
And find a way back home
