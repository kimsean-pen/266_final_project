Can't wait to get home
Baby dial your number
Can you pick up the phone?
Cause I wanna holla

Daydreamin' bout you
All day in school

Can't concentrate
Wanna have your voice in my ear
Till momma come and say it's too late
Cause the lights are on outside

Wish there was somewhere to hide
Cause I just don't want
To say goodbye
Cause you are my baby baby
Nothing really matters

I don't really care
What nobody tells me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance

My first teenage love affair
Eh eh eh eh, eh eh, eh eh eh eh aay

I love our secret meetings
On the 5th floor staircase
I'm gonna give you this letter
Of all the things I can't say

Want you to be my first
My last, my ending and beginning
I write your name in my book
Your last name my first
I'm your Mrs.

Cause the lights are on outside
Wish there was somewhere to hide
I just don't want
To say goodbye
Cause you are my baby baby
Nothing really matters
I don't really care
What nobody tells me
I'm gonna be here

It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair
Eh eh eh eh, eh eh, eh eh eh eh aay
Hey boy

You know I really like being with you
Just hanging out is fun
So maybe we can go to
First base
Because I feel you

2nd base
Want you to feel me too boy
3rd base
Better pump the brakes
Ooh baby, slow down
I gotta go home now
Cause the lights are on outside
Wish there was somewhere to hide
Cause I just don't want
To say goodbye
Cause you are my baby baby
Nothing really matters
I don't really care
What nobody tells me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair
Ahh, baby baby
Nothing really matters
I don't really care
What nobody tells me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair
Eh eh eh eh, eh eh, eh aay
