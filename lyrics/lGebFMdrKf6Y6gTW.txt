Calling Paul the Suffering
On you

Eric, I've been rolling
Met with tears
Loving tears
Only

Paul [?] down
Dear, I'm the messiah
Hear me now, dear
Clear tone

High above the plains
Wishing was alive again
Knowing only kind of good
Thinking that he could

High above the plains
Wishing was alive again
Knowing only kind of good
Thinking that I could

Here we look back
Ain't it good
Here we look back
Say you could

He's the King of kindness
King of kindness
King of kindness
King of kindness
King of kindness
King ah ah ah ah

I been rolling two years now
And I'll make you proud boo
Do what I like in the morning
Tell me now this and that, do you?

But I'm going up man
Go down I'll see you around me

Do what I like and [?] I want to
Yeah
