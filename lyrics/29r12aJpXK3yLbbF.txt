I met her on Monday
She looked like a gun
And threw back in my face,
My love now I'm gone

Stone in my metal zone
I take rock n roll to get radical

I'm not goin' insane (I'm not goin sane)
I just need more fun (Just need more fun)
Forget goin' your way (Forget what you say)
I do what I want

Stone in my metal zone
I take rock n roll to get radical

Can you get it?
Can you get it?
Can you get it?

I've been tryin' to find you
You keep movin' ahead
Once could never deny you
Now I wish you were dead
