Show me samples... snippety!

Spark! The fuse has set in my brain
Slack flashback, on a hat rack
That slain insect obtains a cheap pain
So I stick a daisy through his head
He sneezes just a little bit
And I squeeze that socket in my left pocket

So confused, I cry out, cry out my ancient name
It's Spathic!

Sticky, tricky, creaky, freaky flit
Dig it out, pick it out, cut it out
That plain impact contains a free strain
No sign is shown at all
No pilot came back at last
My fuse clicks, I try to hold in my left side of my brain

It's Spathic!
It's Spathic!
It's Spathic!
"It's tragic", I lie again!

So clear, false eyes pop out
I take them for my hat
So bizarre, pure, black, tears dropped from them
I try to swear, but I don't have a god

Clash! The fuse has set in my brain
It's just a part of bee-right
It's so cheap, but no claim or complaint
Then I feed that tiny thing some peas
He coughs just a little bit
I don't have any pills; I wonder "Why not?"

Too confused, I found out I lost my ancient hands

It's Spathic!
It's Spathic!
It's Spathic!
It's Spathic!

He tells me which side to flit?
Too tiny, just clicking wings split
Where's my false eyes?
Next ones could be mine

Watch your head, it's heading straight to you!
Watch your head, it's heading straight to you!
Watch your head, it's heading straight to you!
Watch your head, it's heading straight to you!

Spathic, flit to the clash!
