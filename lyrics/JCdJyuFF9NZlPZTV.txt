I never finish anything
I still don't know how
I just want your attention
No quietly
Everything is sharper
In focus now
Maybe I'll leave my house
In 2017
"The year of the Lord"
I'll grow wings and fly into the sun
Is that God or just my own thoughts?
Is that God or just my own thoughts?
Is that God or just my own thoughts?
