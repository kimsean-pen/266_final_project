I want you to know this
Some moments are rare
Don't take me for granted
Just take me there

And I'm never gonna ask for me
I'm never gonna ask for more
Cause when we fall into place
There's nothing else worth dreaming for

So take me back,
Just take me back
Just take me back
Just take me, take me
Just take me back

I'm learning to leave you
Cause you don't ask me to stay
Don't make me believe you
And walk away

So I'm never gonna ask for me
I'm never gonna ask for more
Cause when we fall into place
There's nothing else worth dreaming for

So take me back,
Just take me back
Just take me back
Just take me, take me
I'm not running
Just take me back
Just take me back
Just take me back
Just take me, take me
Just take me back

Don't leave me for nothing
I'll never let you say goodbye
If I don't want it
I promise you it's not the end

So take me back,
Just take me back
Just take me back
Just take me, take me
I'm not running
Just take me back
Just take me back
Just take me back
Just take me, take me
Just take me back
