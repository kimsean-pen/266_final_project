I can't get started from the part
Where I left off yesterday
Should have spent my time a little wiser
I sat alone, guilty as sin
Waiting for words to come from out of my head
Still making sense to anyone

I can't wait to understand the reason
I've yet to translate any meaning
Besides it's not worth it to try
Get out...
Get out...

Locked myself up in a room without a window
Just to see if it was any easier to breathe
I was wrong
Never underestimate the daylight
There it's so much easier to breathe
Yeah

I can't wait to understand the reason
I've yet to translate any meaning
Besides it's not worth it to try
Get out...
Get out...
Get out...
Get out...

I can't wait to understand the reason
I've yet to translate any meaning
Besides it's not worth it to try
Get out...
Get out...
Get out...
Get out...
Get out...
