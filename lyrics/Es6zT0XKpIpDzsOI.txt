Walk down the path
Into the light
Feel the breeze

We're free, dreaming
We need, nothing

Can you believe
How we turned
Something so dark
Into so bright

I can see through the trees to the lake
I see the rain
I can see through the clouds there's a change
I feel your pain

I can see through the trees to the lake
I see the rain
I can see through the clouds there's a change
I feel your pain

Hunger like wolves
Thirsting for pain
Hunting for strife
Yet we remain

Still free, fantasy
Inhale, colour

I can see through the trees to the lake
I see the rain
I can see through the clouds there's a change
I feel your pain

I will not lose face
I will not lose face

We're dreaming
We're breathing now

We're still dreaming
We're still breathing now

I will not lose face
I will not lose face

Through the forest to the open plain
Hear me calling i can hear your name

I can see through the trees to the lake
I see the rain
I can see through the clouds there's a change
I feel your pain

I can see through the trees to the lake
I see the rain
I can see through the clouds there's a change
I feel your pain
