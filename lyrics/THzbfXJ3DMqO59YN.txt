all things aside
i gave enough of my time
i lost a dozen friends of mine
but i don't think it will be long now
please tell me that you won't be long
i hate my body
i love your taste
bird stirring in my chest
you give and take away
restless limb, restless mind
how time will test its teeth
oh god
we lived unloved in unmade beds
you wore me like a necklace
you closed me
like a locket
became something
bloated with doubt
bullied by love
too small for eyes
i think i'm at my best
when nothing's needing me
walked softly as i could
and still i stepped on all their feet
i want to apologize to everyone i see
i want to apologize to everyone i meet
haha
ha ha ha
