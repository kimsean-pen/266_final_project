Ripped up, shredded, denied in denial
Desperate moments collide and define you
And the heart of the hurricane in my head never tires
But tomorrow, who knows, it might be a horror show

Runnin' around, locked down for days
But I'm better today, better today
Lay down on the floor at the end of the road
I'm better today, better today
Runnin' around, run down for days
But I'm better today, better today
I'd rather be deceived but I just can't argue
With what's right in front of me

Hunting sheep in my sleep, no I don't count them
A time to wake every day cause I'm not trying
Know I cut my hair with a pocket knife when I'm on fire
But tomorrow, who knows, it might be a horror show

Runnin' around, locked down for days
But I'm better today, better today
Lay down on the floor at the end of the road
I'm better today, better today
Runnin' around, run down for days
But I'm better today, better today
I'd rather be deceived but I just can't argue
With what's right in front of me

Runnin' on fumes then I was empty
Believe me, believe me
Runnin' on fumes then I was empty
Believe me, believe me
Runnin' on fumes then I was empty
Believe me, believe me
Runnin' on fumes then I was empty
Believe me, believe me

Runnin' on, runnin' on
Runnin' on, runnin' on
Runnin' on, runnin' on
Runnin' on, runnin' on

Runnin' around, locked down for days
But I'm better today, better today
Lay down on the floor at the end of the road
I'm better today, better today
Runnin' around, run down for days
But I'm better today, better today
I'd rather be deceived but I just can't argue
With what's right in front of me
