All that you started will carry on, honey
You throw in a little, a lot upon, you fool me
You're givin' it up and you're movin' on
Cause you wanna be free
You're gettin' so easy to read
Lies are the truth
That you tell to yourself
Watch other fools
Who can take what they're dealt
You say it again just to rub it in, baby
How can you not have a little fun, dark face honey
Givin' it up and you're movin' on
Cause you wanna be free

You're gettin' so easy to read
Lies are the truth
That you tell to yourself
Lies are the truth
That you tell to yourself
Watch other fools
Who can take what they're dealt
Lies are the truth
That you tell to yourself
Lies are the truth
That you tell to yourself
Watch other fools
Who can take what they're dealt
