It hurts to breathe, but I don't care
The weight of the world, the thoughts I couldn't bear
The city sleeps, I'm making plans
The less you know, the better understand

Then I look and see that place, it fools me every time
Digging deeper pulls me under, am I wasting time? I'm next in line

I pace and fret, my blood, it burns
The reason we know, but still we never learn
The clock stood still, my legs grow weak
It says it's done, I beg it not to speak

Then I look and see that place, it fools me every time
Digging deeper pulls me under, am I wasting time? I'm next in line

But you're gonna, you'll remember, you're a fucking fraid
Never wanna, never gonna, and your bed is made
But you're gonna, you'll remember, you're a fucking fraid
Never wanna, never gonna, and your bed is made
But you're gonna, you'll remember, you're a fucking fraid
Never wanna, never gonna, and your bed is made
But you're gonna, you'll remember, you're a fucking fraid
Never wanna, never gonna, and your bed is made

Then I look and see that place, it fools me every time
Digging deeper pulls me under, am I wasting time?
Then I look and see that place, it fools me every time
Digging deeper pulls me under, am I wasting time? I'm next in line
