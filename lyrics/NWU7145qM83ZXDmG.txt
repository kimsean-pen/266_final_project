I live upstairs from you
I just became your neighbor
We could be sisters, brothers, pawns in love and labor

And I want you to know I won't gossip or gloat
We could share anything
We are siamese twin

I live upstairs from you
I'd like to get together
Let's get to know each other's flaws and failures better

And I want you to share anything you can spare
I'll be your next of kin
We are siamese twin

I couldn't sleep last night
I'm outlining your body
We're so alike, the two of us, so you can't fool me

Come upstairs for a drink
It's about time, don't you think
I'll be all ears and yours
It's what neighbors are for
We can do anything
We are siamese twin
