I thought you'd listen to my reasoning
But now I see, you don't hear a thing
Try to make you see, how it's got to be

Yes, it's all that, all or nothing
Yeah, yeah, all or nothing
Come on, hot there
All or nothing for me

Things could work out
Just like I want them to, yeah
If I could have the other half of you, yeah
You know I would, but I can't, if I only could

Yes, it's yeah, all or nothing
Oh yeah, all or nothing
You'll hear my children say
All or nothing for me

I didn't tell you no lies, yeah
So don't just sit there and cry, girl

Yeah, all or nothing
All or nothing, all or nothing
Do you know what I mean, yeah?
You got to, got to, got to keep on trying, yeah

All or nothing, um hum, yeah
All or nothing, to keep on working out for me
All or nothing for me, for me, for me
Come on children, yeah

All or nothing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All or nothing, I kept on singing to myself
All or nothing, yeah for me, yeah
