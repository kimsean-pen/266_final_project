if it's not possible to change people's minds
we might as well just spin on ice
spin around until we die
i can read it in their eyes
they disagree with all my likes
and i will never understand why
please go out with me tonight
far away from the streetlights
i need you in the hall of ice
i need you to be on my side
save the frozen heart of mine
spin around until we die

ich möchte mich mit dir verlaufen
ich möchte eiskunstlaufen

we should leave the house tonight
and lose our digital life
i meet you in the hall of ice
and all the complaints of mine
the disbeliefs in human kind
i put it all on ice

ich möchte mich mit dir verlaufen
wenn wir eiskunstlaufen
