Listen to the breathing of that which in sick delectation*
And devouring famine restores the new order
By contamination and incubation
Unity restored in imperious necessity
What a vertigo under the vault of the crimson sky!
L'exclusion inconcevable d'une seule ame serait un danger pour l'Harmonie
Ã©ternelle.

I am an accomplice and my disheveled laughters and moans
Are of the same essence as the fervour of a Saint
It is senseless to fight against this infinite stream
Behind this threshold life exhausts itself, loses itself
Rejoice, for tonight it is an eerie birth that we celebrate!
And with dusk, as shadows slowly recover the land
The most extreme solitude drapes the shoulders
Of a distant silhouette bearing a glacial emptiness
Laden like a luminous storm in which sun and lightening are prolonged
A wound through which, hastening from all points of the universe
Desolation spreads in choatich convulsions
