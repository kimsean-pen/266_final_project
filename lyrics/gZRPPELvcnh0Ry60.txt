This sunny Sunday is a good day to go.
Guess you want me to stay,
Well let me know.
And I hate to say,
It's been a waste of time.
I hate to interrupt the flow.

Why, why, why?
Hushabye!
Hushabye, why aren't you ready to go?
Why, why, why?
Hushabye!
Couldn't we fast forward all through this show?

You say you'd love to,
But you've lots left to do.
Almost decided to stay 'cause of you.
And I hate to tell you,
To exchange your dreams.
For a one-way ticket, no return.

Why, why, why?
Hushabye!
Hushabye, why aren't you ready to go?
Why, why, why?
Hushabye!
Couldn't we fast forward all through this show?

Why?
What you hanging up for?
What you doing that for?
What you breaking up for?
Why, hushabye?
I hate to interrupt the flow!
For a one way ticket, no return!

Why, why, why?
Hushabye!
Hushabye, why aren't you ready to go?
Why, why, why?
Hushabye!
Couldn't we fast forward all through this show?

Why, why, why?
What you breaking up for?
Why, hushabye?
