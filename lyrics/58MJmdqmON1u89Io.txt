Dance with me below crystal knives
Chandeliers ablaze
We'll dance in fear of our own lives
That our eyes contain
Behind these masks we renegade against the sound
We'll let our voices slowly fade and ring out

Crystal chandeliers hang
Crystal chandeliers hang
Gently swaying with our bodies, fall down
Race upon us, hammer into the ground
Crystal chandeliers hang
Crystal chandeliers hang

We dance among our shadows
Our enemies connected feet to feet

We dance among our shadows
Our enemies connected feet to feet
I'll take the lead
I won't run, I won't hide from this
Dance into the night

Gently swaying with our bodies, fall down
Race upon us, hammer into the ground
Crystal chandeliers hang
Crystal chandeliers hang

Hiding (hiding) behind the mask (only lasts 'til)
'Til you see the reflection of a liar in the glass
