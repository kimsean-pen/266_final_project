it's summer, so they say
i sit and watch the sunlight turn from red to grey

one look backward, the image is fractured
i never thought i'd get this far when every step treads in the shards
a journey incomplete, i pull the glss out of my feet
and put back the pieces like broken bones healing

[pre-
so what does it matter
so what does it matter when pieces i gather
are torn up and scattered
i crack, snap, and shatter my bones
feel my skin turn to stone again

affliction's left its mark on me
my temper vapid and heartless
submission force feeds my apathy
but every breath is catharsis

cautious & optimistic
life fcks me up sometimes but i don't want to miss it
i'm still wading through this bull sht
and i meant it when i said it
life will eat you if you let it

[pre-
so what does it matter
so what does it matter when pieces i gather
are torn up and scattered
i crack, snap, and shatter my bones
feel my skin turn to stone again

affliction's left its mark on me
my temper vapid and heartless
submission force feeds my apathy
but every breath is catharsis

all cut and sewn, so overgrown
i am the rocks on the shr
your waves always break over me
unmoved by heartache and stone to the core
i gave up trying to run away
it's with me every step i take
rise to my feet
this earth will never know my knees

(all cut and sewn)
my temper vapid and heartless
(so overgrown)
but every breath is catharsis
i am the rocks on the shr, (all cut and sewn)
your waves always break over me
unmoved by heartache and stone to the core
i gave up trying to run away (so overgrown)
it's with me every step i take
rise to my feet (but every step is catharsis)
this earth will never know my knees
