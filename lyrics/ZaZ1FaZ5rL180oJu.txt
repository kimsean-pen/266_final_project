Am I Supposed To Put My Life On Hold
Because You Don't How To Act
And You Don't Know Where Your Life Is Going
Am I Supposed To Be Torn Apart
Broken Hearted, In A Corner Crying
Pardon Me If I Don't Show It

I Don't Care If I Never See You Again
I'll Be Alright
Take This Final Piece Of Advice
And Get Yourself Together
But Either Way, Baby I'm Gone

I'm So Over It
I've Been There And Back
Changed All My Numbers
And Just In Case You're Wondering
I Got That New "I'm A Single Girl" Swag
Got Me With My Girls And We're Singing It
SING!

Na Na Na Na (Hey)
Na Na Na Na (Hey)
Hey Hey Hey (Hey)
Goodbye (Goodbye)

Na Na Na Na (Hey)
Na Na Na Na (Hey)
Hey Hey Hey (Hey)
Goodbye (Goodbye)

Cut My Hair Cause It Reminded Me Of You
I Know You Like The Long Do
Had To Switch My Attitude Up
Thinking Of Changing Up How I Ride
No More On The Passenger Side
Too Bad You Missed Out
On The Way That I Drive It

I Don't Care If I Never See You Again
I'll Be Alright
Take This Final Piece Of Advice
And Get Yourself Together
But Either Way, Baby I'm Gone

I'm So Over It
I've Been There And Back
Changed All My Numbers
And Just In Case You're Wondering
I Got That New "I'm A Single Girl" Swag
Got Me With My Girls And We're Singing It
SING!

Na Na Na Na (Hey)
Na Na Na Na (Hey)
Hey Hey Hey (Hey)
Goodbye (Goodbye)

Na Na Na Na (Hey)
Na Na Na Na (Hey)
Hey Hey Hey (Hey)
Goodbye (Goodbye)

Heh Heh Hey, Heh Heh Hey, Heh Heh Hey, Goodbye

I'm So Over It
I've Been There And Back
Changed All My Numbers
And Just In Case You're Wondering
I Got That New "I'm A Single Girl" Swag
Got Me With My Girls And We're Singing It
SING!

Na Na Na Na (Hey)
Na Na Na Na (Hey)
