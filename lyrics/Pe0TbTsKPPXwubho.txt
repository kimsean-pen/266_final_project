He found solace at last
I'm empty they're fleeting fast
I thought I'd be okay
They're leaving me, one day it's all the same
All the same, all the same

I feel five years behind
Gasping for breath
One day at a time
I am sick inside, so dumb
The sun will mask my pain
It's all the same

Acting professional
When I'm nothing but a self-conscious child
I thought I'd be okay
They're leaving me one day

Why can't I be alone?
I'm like a dog at the door

I feel five years is behind
Gasping for breath
One day at a time
I am sick inside, so dark
The sun will masque my pain
It's all the same
