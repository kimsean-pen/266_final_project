As a culture, we tread crooked in the brume of unrest.
As a culture, we careen down a narrow path, overgrown with blight.
As a culture, we trample over the disharmony of nature's decline.
As a culture, we are rank with the miasma of oppression.

We must shed the darkness of the spirit
And bare our souls to the solitude of reality.
We must burn all weakness in the spirit
And spare our souls the misery of downfall.
We must transform the core of the spirit
And guide our souls to the light of wisdom.

Transfigure!
At Earth's behest
Transfigure!
The Earth commands

Man has transfigured the Earth, now we must transfigure ourselves!
