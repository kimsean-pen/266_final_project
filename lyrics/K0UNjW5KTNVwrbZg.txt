We have a will to make necessity.
Shouldn't obey, obey, obey.
These are the days when words come easily
To have something to say, to say, to say.

My legs took me where my mind refused to go
I just thought that you should know

I'm seeing clearer than ever before
Describing in plain terms
Whats ahead, whats ahead, whats ahead.
Whats ahead, whats ahead, whats ahead.

Denying any institution
Shaking hands concealing thorns.
Ignore the easy retribution
Instead of reaching back with horns.

My legs took me where my mind refused to go
I just thought that you should know,
Instead of grabbing for the things I've left below,
I wished my time away so slow.

I'm seeing clearer than ever before
Describing in plain terms
Whats ahead, whats ahead, whats ahead.
Whats ahead, whats ahead, whats ahead
