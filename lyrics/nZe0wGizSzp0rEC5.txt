Try to think
But my mind it ponders
Try the reason with
But I wonder
What's this thing called another
Don't fight the feeling
Let the sound take over
Atmosphere around my head
Ozone the music's turning me wet
Thoughts of peace
love
unity
But no one in the world understands me
What do I do
I lose control
No
I giv the rhythm my soul
Let it a side
find a way
To make this world a better place
Only one way to know
What's to do it.
Open your heart
free your mind
Give your soul to the music
Just do it
And feel the vibe
