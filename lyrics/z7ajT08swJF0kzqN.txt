The small simple lies poison everything
one by one killing all of the memories
now it's time to put this heart out of its misery
I've been dying, dying for too long
the small simple lies poison everything
one by one killing all of the memories
you can take what you want
and leave when you please
but just remember I'm not waiting for you
no I won't wait for you

The ship has sailed and I'm over you

I swear I gave you anything and everything
every little piece of me
but all you did was look away
when I said "I've had enough I'm moving on"
you said you're love was never lost
I guess you didn't realize
until all of it was gone

The pain and the fights never seemed to end
every night wondering if we're even friends
now it's time to put this love out of it's misery
it's been dying for too long

If you're in pain that's how you belong

All the years and the tears
that I wasted on you
the regrets I will take to the grave
but I won't be missing you
