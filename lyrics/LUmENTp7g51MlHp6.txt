I'm livin' like "catch me if you can," you know?
This the amazin' true story of the youngest and
most darin' conman
Tricky, swiftly, but yet viciously
It's always a mystery
Everyday a new identity

Jumped out, woke up on the wrong side of the
sheet
But really I should've been born on Halloween
I ain't no demon semen but I do evil deeds
My daddy don't never see me, I ain't no devil
seed
I don't remember his last time checkin' up on
me
Why you dropped another album in a week?
I'm a wolf, but I be dressin' like a sheep
Put on my monkey suit and go orangutan

Poppin' monkeys, poppin' bars make me swing
Who the fuck you are? You in and out my brain
I know I'm smart, you make me do some crazy
things
Monkey on my back, let a nigga be, please
Niggas free out here but they ain't free
You out here physically but locked up mentally
Why everywhere I go, I gotta bring the ski?
No face, no case, live everyday like Halloween

Jumped out, woke up on the wrong side of the
sheet
But really I should've been born on Halloween
I ain't no demon semen but I do evil deeds
My daddy don't never see me, I ain't no devil
seed
I don't remember his last time checkin' up on
me
Why you dropped another album in a week?
I'm a wolf, but I be dressin' like a sheep
Put on my monkey suit and go orangutan

I tricked so much-a individuals for a treat
K Boogie with the hoodie, best believe
It's hot, he got the hoodie on to hide the heat
And he got so much tricks up up his sleeve
All them nights I had to mask up on a scheme
My self conscience got me fightin' in my sleep
I can't forget about it, I see it in my dreams
I'm kickin' in yo' door, but I don't want no
sweets
Give me what I came for so I can leave
You know I'm serious, don't you feel my
energy?
No this not a joke, everybody on they knees
Don't try to buck the jack, you get bucked, get
back

Jumped out, woke up on the wrong side of the
sheet
But really I should've been born on Halloween
I ain't no demon semen but I do evil deeds
My daddy don't never see me, I ain't no devil
seed
I don't remember his last time checkin' up on
me
Why you dropped another album in a week?
I'm a wolf, but I be dressin' like a sheep
Put on my monkey suit and go orangutan

You ain't gotta be scared of me, just respect a
nigga, please?
I'm startin' to think my cranium got a disease
They be like, "Yo Kodak, I just seen you on the
scene"
They be like, "I ain't approach you though,
'cause you was lookin' mean"
Don't need no friends, I got a big family
I'm a G, it's in my genes
Glock .23, it's in my jeans
Ain't playin' freeze tag but I got that beam
Sorry baby I lied, you was just a fiend
I don't love ya, I just wanted to get in yo' jeans
Tricked her for her treat
Tricked her out her panties
Yeah, I can't get romantic
No, I'm not Satanic
I'm not Satanic

Who said that?
Why you said that?
Who said that?
