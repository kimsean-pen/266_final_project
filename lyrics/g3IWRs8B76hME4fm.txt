Well, I had a dream I
Stood beneath an orange sky
Yes, I had a dream I
Stood beneath an orange sky
With my brother standing by
With my brother standing by

I said, brother, you know, you know
It's a long road we've been walking on
Yes it is, yes it is, you know
Brother it is
Such a long road we've been walking on
(Oh brother, oh brother)

And I had a dream I
Stood beneath an orange sky
With my sister standing by
With my sister standing by
I said, here is what I know now, sister
Here is what I know now, goes like this

In your love
My salvation lies in your love
My salvation lies in your love
My salvation lies in your love
In your love, in your love

Oh, but you know I'm so weary
And you know, my heart
My heart's been broken now
Sometimes, sometimes
My mind is too strong to carry on
Too strong, too strong to carry on

But when I am alone
When I've thrown off the weight of this crazy stone
When I've lost all care for the things I own
That's when I miss you
That's when I miss you
You who are my home
You who are my home now

Here is what I know now, brother
Here is what I know now, sister, goes like this

In your love
My salvation lies in your love
My salvation lies in your love
My salvation lies in your love
My salvation lies in your love
My salvation lies in your love
My salvation lies in your love
My salvation lies in your love
In your love, in your love
Your love, now

Well, I had a dream I
Stood beneath an orange sky
With my brother and my sister standing by
With my brother and my sister standing by
With my brother and my sister standing by
