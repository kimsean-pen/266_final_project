I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
‘Cause you're evil
And you lie
And if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
But I won't cry

Loved and lost
And some may say
When usually it's nothing
Surely you're happy
It should be this way?
I say no
I'm gonna kill my dog
May the lines sag
The lines sag heavy
And deep tonight

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
‘Cause you're evil
And you lie
And if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
But I won't cry

Loved and lost
And some may say
When usually it's nothing
Surely you're happy
It should be this way?
I said no
And then I shot myself
So drink, drink, drink
And be ill tonight

From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind

Behind, behind
Behind, behind
Behind, behind
Oh unhappy birthday
Behind, behind
Behind
