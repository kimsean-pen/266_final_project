Last night I had me a dream son
The end of the world could be seen
No sign of life could I feel son
Nothing was what it had been

Black as the night, life out of sight
You can't imagine the scene

Last night I had me a dream son
The end of the world could be seen
I didn't know where to turn son
The absence of life was obscene

The end of time or just in my mind
I know that it's hard to believe

And I can almost see the end of the world
And I can almost see the end of the world
So give me a minute
And I'll put you in it
But you must never return

It could occur any day son
Just you remember and pray
You have what you love
Now love what you have
And maybe then you will last a bit longer

Black as the night, life out of sight
You can't imagine the scene

And I can almost see the end of the world
And I can almost see the end of the world
So give me a minute
And I'll put you in it
But you must never return

Last night I had a dream
The strangest that I'd ever seen
Yes you were there and you were
Telling everybody not to worry
Just let it be
Then you led me to believe
Everything happens in threes
But as you spoke then I awoke
Only to find that we'd arrived
At the end of the world.
