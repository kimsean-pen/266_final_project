Jodie wears a hat although it hasn't rained for six days
She says a girl needs a gun these days
Hey, on account of all the rattlesnakes

She looks like Eva Marie Saint in On the Waterfront
She reads Simone de Beauvoir in her American circumstance

She is less than sure if her heart has come to stay in San Jose
And her neverborn child still haunts her
As she speeds down the freeway
As she tries her luck with the traffic police
Out of boredom more than spite
She never finds no trouble she tries too hard
She's obvious despite herself

She looks like Eva Marie Saint in On the Waterfront
She says all she needs is therapy yeh
All you need is love is all you need

Jodie never sleeps because there are always needles in the hay
She says that a girl needs a gun these days
Hey, on account of all the rattlesnakes

She looks like Eva Marie Saint in On the Waterfront
As she reads Simone de Beauvoir in her American circumstance
Her heart. her heart is like crazy paving
Upside down and back to front
She says, "Ooh it's so hard to love
When love was your great disappointment."
