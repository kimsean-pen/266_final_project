Well, my time went so quickly
I went lickety-splitly
Out to my ol' 55
As I pulled away slowly
Feeling so holy
God knows I was feeling alive

Now, the sun's coming up
I'm riding with Lady Luck
Freeway, cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade
And I lead the parade
Just a-wishin' I'd stayed a little longer
Oh Lord, let me tell ya that the feeling getting stronger

And it's six in the morning
Gave me no warning
I had to be on my way
Well, there's trucks all a-passin' me
And the lights all are flashing
I'm on my way home from your place

And now the sun's coming up
And I'm riding with Lady Luck
Freeway, cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade
And I lead the parade
Just a-wishin' I'd stayed a little longer
Oh Lord, let me tell ya, the feeling getting stronger

And my time went so quickly
I went lickety-splitly
Out to my ol' 55
As I pulled away slowly
Feeling so holy
God knows I was feeling alive

And now the sun's coming up
I'm riding with Lady Luck
Freeway, cars and trucks
Freeway, cars and trucks
Freeway, cars and trucks
