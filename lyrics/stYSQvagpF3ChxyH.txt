Oba, oba, she's my shoo shoo
And she knows that I'm her shoo shoo
Oba, oba, take my hand now
And we're gonna make the love in samba
I'll try to make the sun shine on my way
And paint the blue skies for today
And we'll be sitting on the grass
Smelling happiness
Don't wake me now
'Cause I'm dreamin' of my shoo shoo
The moon will raise as we walk by
And wall the stars will come behind us
We're gonna make our lives much bright
Smelling happiness
Don't wake me now
'Cause I'm dreamin' of my shoo shoo
