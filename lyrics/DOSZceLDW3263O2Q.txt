You don't know the torture
You don't know the pain
Loving what you can't have
Is drive me insane
I'm dangerous, I pull away
You're dangerous, so keep your distance
Still you run through my veins
And there's nothing I can do

I'll be waiting, waiting for you
Meet me in the, in the next life

I still can hear you screaming
I still can see your eyes
Believing in your love for me
As you watched me die
I'm dangerous, I pull away
You're dangerous, so keep your distance
Still you run through my veins
And there's nothing I can do

I'll be waiting, waiting for you
Meet me in the, in the next life

So now we've gone our own ways
Memories dried and scabbed
Your scars show on your hands
Mine show in my eyes
So now we've gone our own ways
Memories dried and scabbed
These scars show now

You're dangerous

I'll be waiting, waiting for you
Meet me in the, in the next life

Now we've gone our own ways
Memories dried and scabbed
These scars show now
