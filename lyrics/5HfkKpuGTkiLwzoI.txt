In my suggestions
I was thinking far ahead
Thinking about love and death

But maybe you'd confess
That you didn't hear a thing
You didn't even say your name

Didn't even say your name

A holy garden
With a little palm tree shade
And all the time you gave me

Sand in your hair
Salt water on your skin
If I guess your name, I win
Don't I?

It never really felt that real
A tiny island we could steal
What if I'd missed my flight?
I wish I hadn't left on time

In my suggestions
I was thinking far ahead
Thinking about love and death
