Yes, yes, I know you're hungry
Ah, and here comes dinner!
Feed my Frankenstein!

Well, I ain't evil
I'm just good lookin'
Start a little fire
And baby start cookin'
I'm a hungry man
But i don't want pizza
I'll blow down your house
And then i'm gonna eat ya
Bring you to a simmer
Right on time
Run my greasy fingers
Up your greasy spine
Feed my Frankenstein
Meet my libido
"He's a psycho"
Feed my Frankenstein
Hungry for love, and it's feeding time
You don't want to talk
So baby shut up
And let me drink the wine
From your fur tea cup
Velcro candy, sticky sweet
Make my tattoos melt in the heat
Well, I ain't no veggie
Like my flesh on the bone
Alive and lickin' on
Your ice cream cone
Feed my Frankenstein
Meet my libido
"He's a psycho"
Feed my Frankenstein
Hungry for love, and it's feeding time
Baby whoa-whoa oh yeah
Feed my Frankenstei-ei-ein
Baby chow down
Feed my Frankenstei-ei-ein
"He's a psycho"
Feed my Frankenstein
Meet my libido
"He's a psycho"
Feed my Frankenstein
Hungry for love, and it's "lunch time"
Baby whoa-whoa oh yeah
Feed my Frankenstei-ei-ein
Whoa-whoa baby chow down
Feed my Frankenstei-ei-ein
Feed my Frankenstein
Meet my libido
"He's such a psycho"
Feed my Frankenstein
Hungry for love, and it's feeding time
Baby whoa-whoa oh yeah
Feed my Frankenstei-ei-ein
Whoa-whoa baby chow down
Feed my Frankenstei-ei-ein
