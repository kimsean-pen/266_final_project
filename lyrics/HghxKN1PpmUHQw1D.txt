You'll take me home tonight
We both know that
You hold my arm firmly
And say oh please, don't leave

Don't you worry
'Cause I'm staying here
Don't you worry
'Cause I'm not leaving
Don't you worry
'Cause I'll stay here with you, with you
And I'll stay here with you, with you

You say it's time to leave
'Cause it's getting dark
Feet moving on their own
We trust they'll take us home

Don't you worry
'Cause I'm staying here
Don't you worry
'Cause I'm not leaving
Don't you worry
'Cause I'll stay here with you, with you

So, won't you save me now?
So, won't you save me now?
So, won't you save me now?
So, won't you save me now?
Save me how

Don't you worry
'Cause I'm staying here
Don't you worry
'Cause I'm not leaving
Don't you worry
'Cause I'll stay here with you, with you
I'll stay here with you, with you
I'll stay here with you, with you
I'll stay here with you
