You sleep better when you're
you eat better when you're
you sing better when you're
you need me more when your straight

Is this the weekend
is that your girlfriend
she's green and innocent
you smoke her like she's incense
you smile
stay straight for me

I'll wait till summers over
I'll love you through October
I'll give you everything
I'll trade you anything for her
stay straight for me
