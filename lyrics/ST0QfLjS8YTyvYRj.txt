Now I was born with tears in my eyes
Like everybody else I know
Kicking and screaming and all I could see
Was a light in a world so cold

No one to hold you, feels so lonely
Left out on your own
But we were born with tears in our eyes
That's how we learned the strength to fight

It's a beautiful life
Well, you won't always see it that way
When you're deep in a hole with nowhere to go
And you can't see it change

It's a beautiful life
'Cause it's just out of sight, oh, oh
It's a beautiful life, yeah, well

You're scared, got the fear every day
Sounds like everybody else I know
Takes a hole in the ground or the sky falling down
Before we can let it show

If you're just like me, you're trying to believe
That it's all going to work out fine
We can live with the doubt, just try to do without
Maybe we don't have to fight

It's a beautiful life
Well, you won't always see it that way
When you're deep in a hole with nowhere to go
And you can't see it change

It's a beautiful life
'Cause it's just out of sight, oh, oh
It's a beautiful life, yeah

I tried so hard to keep hanging on
Well, maybe you should just let it go
Let the hope in your heart break the fall

Come on now, gotta sing with me

It's a beautiful life
Well, but you won't always see it that way
When you're deep in a hole with nowhere to go
And you can't see it change
It's a beautiful life
'Cause it's just out of sight, unpredictable
It's a beautiful life, yeah
It's a beautiful life
See it that way
Can't see it change
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
And you won't always see it that way
