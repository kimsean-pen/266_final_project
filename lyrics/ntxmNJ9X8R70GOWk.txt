Chorus:
you're the one (you're the one)
who set me free (set me free)
when you're close to me
and all that i do
is think about a way (bout a way)
to make you stay, with me (with me)
baby i'm fallin apart
cause you the way to my heart
First verse:
oh baby
i knew it
the moment you looked in my eyes, my life was in your hands
you changed me
completely
and now you say you wanna let go, of the love we had
Bridge:
i just don't wanna lose you again
baby i want you to know
know that
Chorus:
you're the one
who set me free
when you're close to me
and all that i do
is think about a way
to make you stay, with me
baby i'm fallin apart
cause you know the way to my heart
Second verse:
oh baby
if only
you could see the way that i feel about you
cause i need you
beside me
is there anything i can say
before you walk away
Bridge:
i just don't wanna lose you again
baby i want you to know
know that
Chorus:
you're the one
who set me free
when you're close to me
and all that i do
is think about a way
to make you stay, with me
baby i'm fallin apart
cause you know the way to my heart
Last verse:
what am i gonna do
no, i just cannot live, can't breath, without you (without you)
i want you back in my life
and i wanna set things right
you know the way to my heart, baby
Chorus:
you're the one
who set me free
when you're close to me
and all that i do
is think about a way
to make you stay with me

You're the one (heart)
who set me free (oh no, no no no baby)
when you're close to me
and all that i do
is think about a way
to make you stay, with me
baby i'm fallin apart
cause you know the way to my heart
