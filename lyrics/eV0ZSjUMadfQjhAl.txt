We pray for our fathers, pray for our mothers
Wishing our families well
We sing songs for the wishing, of those who are kissing
But not for the missing

So this ones for all The Lost Children
This ones for all The Lost Children
This ones for all The Lost Children, wishing them well
And wishing them home
When you sit there addressing, counting your blessings
Biding your time
When you lay me down sleeping and my heart is weeping
Because Im keeping a place

For all The Lost Children
This is for all The Lost Children
This ones for all The Lost Children, wishing them well
And wishing them home
Home with their fathers
Snug close and warm, loving their mothers
I see the door simply wide open
But no one can find thee

So pray for all The Lost Children
Lets pray for all The Lost Children
Just think of all The Lost Children, wishing them well
This is for all The Lost Children
This ones for all The Lost Children
Just think of all The Lost Children
Wishing them well, and wishing them home
