Things are gonna change around here
When I get my head clear
Not gonna smoke less weed
Not gonna drink less beer
I'll just try a little harder not to fall in love with every girl
whose only interaction with me is
eye contact or the way they say my name

I'm gonna write some new songs
I'm gonna finish old ones
If I've got enemies then I'll fuck 'em all off
If I find the time I'll write a big fucking book
with a small fuckin' font 'cause I do what I want

Hey, you had a long damn day at work
And you still got paid less than dirt
You still got drugs ready to go
Waiting for you when you get home

You've got a long long way to go
So lets show them who runs the show
I know you fucking told me so
But I've got nowhere else to go

I know it ruins the vibe and flow, but we all know that life can blow!
