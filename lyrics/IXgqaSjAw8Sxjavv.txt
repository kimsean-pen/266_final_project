I've been trying for hours just to think of what exactly to say
I thought I'd leave you with a letter or fiery speech
Like when an actor makes an exit at the end of a play

And I've been dying for hours
Trying to fill up all the holes with some sense
I'd like to know how you faded and you threw it away?
I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant

Well I could tell you goodbye or maybe see you around
With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks
We started out with a bang and at the top of the world
Now the guns are exhausted, the bullets are blanks
And every thing's blank

If I could only find the words then I would write it all down
If I could only find a voice I would speak
Oh it's there in my eyes, oh can't you see me tonight
C'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep

If I could only find the words then I would write it all down
If I could only find a voice I would speak
Oh it's there in my eyes, oh can't you see me tonight
C'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep

I've been whispering softly, trying to build a cry up to a scream
We let the past slip away and put the future on hold
Now the present is nothing but a hollowed out dream

And I've been dying for hours
Trying to fill up all the holes with some sense
I'd like to know why you faded and you threw it away
I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant

Well I could tell you goodbye or maybe see you around
With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks
But now the rooms are all empty, the candles are dark
The guns are exhausted
And the bullets are blanks and every thing's blank

If I could only find the words then I would write it all down
If I could only find a voice I would speak
Oh it's there in my eyes so can't you see me tonight
C'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep

Oh it's there in my eyes and coming straight from my heart
It's running silent and angry and deep
Oh it's there in my eyes and it's all I can say
C'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep

For all the hours we'll be spending along
For all the dreams we'll ignore
And all those promises we promised to keep
They won't be kept any more

For the magic that our bodies had made
For the love that we lost
And all the secrets that we somehow betrayed
for whatever the cost
For the memories stealing out of your bed
For the lies we've believed
And all the things that can never be kept
Why don't you look at me and read 'em and weep?
C'mon and look at me and read 'em and
It's there in my eyes and comin' straight from my heart
It's runnin' silent, and angry, and deep
It's there in my eyes and it's all I can say
C'mon and look at me and read 'em and weep
