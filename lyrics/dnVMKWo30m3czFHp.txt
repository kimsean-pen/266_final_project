We've only reached the third day, of a seven day binge
I can always see your name, disintegrated from my lips
We've only reached the third day, of a seven day binge
I can always see your name, disintegrated from my lips

Hmmmmmmmm
Hmmmmmmmm

I can't decide if you're wearing me out, or wearing me well
I just feel like I'm condemned to wear someone else's hell
We've only reached the third day, of a seven day binge
I can always see your name, disintegrated from my lips

Hmmmmmmmm
Hmmmmmmmm

I got bullets, in the booth
Rather be your victim than be with you
I got bullets, in the booth
Rather be your victim than be with you

Hmmmmmmmm

I've reached the third day, of a seven day binge
I can always see your name, disintegrated from my lips

Hmmmmmmmm
Hmmmmmmmm

Rather be your victim than be with you
