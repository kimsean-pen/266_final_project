I wonder who's to blame
For the world of the present
Ten bucks say it's a man
Far from love and affection

This world was never meant for us
Nah-nah-nah, it's for the
Girls and children first and then men
Boys, man up
Nah-nah-nah, it's for the
Girls and children first and then men, last

Don't you abandon ship
Be the savior of many
Or drown right where you live
Kiss that fear in your belly

This world was never meant for us
Nah-nah-nah, it's for the
Girls and children first and then men
Boys, man up
Nah-nah-nah, it's for the
Girls and children first and then men, last

And I know you got the message
With love to you
Took it Tom, but never read it
What the fuck? So rude
(I wonder who's to blame)
Wish you could man up
It can't be that tough
Shit ain't fair, never was, call it bad luck
Superman buff
Thought you were that tough
I shed a tear, life ain't fair, call it bad luck

This world was never meant for us
Nah-nah-nah, it's for the
Girls and children first and then men
Boys, man up
Nah-nah-nah, it's for the
Girls and children first and then men, last
