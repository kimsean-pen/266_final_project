Far in the distant future
Beyond the pages of our time.
Cold blooded wicked tyrants
Threaten the freedom of mankind.
Corruption, lust, and greed, defy the new nobility
Changing the course of history.
Across the vast North Empire
Most people struggle to survive.
Living a meek existence
Where they're secludedly oppressed.
We are living day to day
Forced to bear the lion's share
People just don't have the time for music any more.
And no one seems to care
My friends have seen the chosen one
A quest for freedom has begun
He will be the answer to our prayers
There walks a god among us
Who's seen the writing on the wall.
He is the revolution
He'll be the one to save us all.
My brother Gabriel, is all the hope we need.
Shining like a beacon in the night.
Should give Ravenskill a reason to believe
Music is the gift he brings
The songbird stops to listen when he sings.
