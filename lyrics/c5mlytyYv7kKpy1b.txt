She said she never met nobody do it like me
Falling for my love well you just might be
Find me on Rodeo chilling under palm trees
Find me in the Hills chilling under palm trees
I swear I never met nobody do it like you
Falling for your love something I might do
Find me on rodeo chilling under palm trees
Find me in the hills chilling under palm trees

I got my city on fire
I could flex on you but I wonder why try
I tell you no lies when I say that
the limit is the sky (all the way up)
Switching lanes in an all black
bimmer with a baddie in the passenger side
Hol up, bring it back
I got my city on fire
(I got my city on the fire man)
I could flex on you but I wonder why try
(I don't even need to try man)
I tell you no lies when I say that the limit is the sky
(Going up)
Switching lanes in an all black
bimmer with a baddie in the passenger side
Now she wanna ride
Now she wanna ride

I don't want a piece I want the whole thing
I could see it even thru the smoke screen
Yeah they all want it like a dope fiend
Prayer hands up for the fallen no emojis
They try to tie me down but it's no strings
I need a babe with some waves west coasting
All I gotta say, I took it one way
Ain't nobody coming fucking up my feng shui
Running thru these streets runnin thru these beats
On my 10k in I do it in my sleep
I need a bad thang honey she a freak
I know how you get down when you get up in the sheets yea
She said she never met nobody do it like me
That's cuz there's nobody like me
Nobody like you
And if you forget I'll be there to remind you that

I swear I never met nobody do it like you
Falling for your love something I might do
Find me on rodeo chilling under palm trees
Find me in the hills chilling under palm trees

I got my city on fire
I could flex on you but I wonder why try
I tell you no lies when I say that
the limit is the sky (all the way up)
Switching lanes in an all black
bimmer with a baddie in the passenger side
Hol up, bring it back
I got my city on fire
(I got my city on the fire man)
I could flex on you but I wonder why try
(I don't even need to try man)
I tell you no lies when I say that the limit is the sky
(Going up)
Switching lanes in an all black
bimmer with a baddie in the passenger side
Now she wanna ride
Now she wanna ride
