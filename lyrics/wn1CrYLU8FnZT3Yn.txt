The moment you arrived
They built you up
The sun was in your eyes
You couldn't believe it

Riches all around
You're walking
Stars are on the ground
You start to believe it

Every face along the boulevard is a dreamer just like you
You looked at death in a tarot card
And you saw what you had to do

But nobody knows you now
When you're dying in LA
And nobody owes you now
When you're dying in LA
When you're dying in LA
When you're dying in LA
The power, the power, the power
Oh the power, the power, the power
Of LA

Nights at the chateau
Trapped in your sunset bungalow
You couldn't escape it
Yeah

Drink of paradise
They told you put your blood on ice
You're not gonna make it

Every face along the boulevard is a dreamer just like you
You looked at death in a tarot card
And you saw what you had to do

But nobody knows you now
When you're dying in LA
And nobody owes you now
When you're dying in LA
When you're dying in LA
When you're dying in LA
The power, the power, the power
Oh the power, the power, the power
Of LA
