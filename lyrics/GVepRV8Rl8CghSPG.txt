Another Year Has Gone By
So many 25th's of December

Just as many 4th of July's
And we're still holding it together
It only comes down to you and I
I know that you can still remember

Things we said right from the start
When we said that this could be special
I'm keeping those words deep down in my heart
Another year has gone by

And I'm still the one by your side
After everything that's gone by
There's still no one saying goodbye
Though another year has gone by
I've never been much for occasions

But You never let a birthday go by
Without announcing how much you love me
But the truth was always there
Right there in your eyes
And we're still holding hands when we're walking

Acting like we've only just met
But, how could that be - when there's so much history
I guess that's how true lovers can get
Another year has gone by

And I'm still the one by your side
After everything that's gone by
There's still no one saying goodbye
Though another year has gone by
Another year has gone by
And I'm still the one by your side
After everything that's gone by
There's still no one saying goodbye
Though another year has gone by...
