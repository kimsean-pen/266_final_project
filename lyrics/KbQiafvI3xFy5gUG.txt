Twenty-twenty vision
At you with precision
It would take more than one or two
To get me so into you
I am pretty jaded
And I didn't even say that (I want you)
When you hit me up, there's no reply
Once you're coming on, I go offline
You're the one that sent the message
I don't need you at my beck and call
What makes you so sure (all alone)
You're the one that instigated
I had not reciprocated no
Writing's on the wall
And you wonder why I
Didn't come back
Don't wanna think twice
On the contact
Another wild ride
Another nightcap
I gave you one try
And you wonder why I
Didn't come back
Don't wanna think twice
On the contact
Another wild ride
Another nightcap
I gave you one try
'Til you're making me your alibi
No disrespect
I just wanna keep it candid
Guessing we've got different standards, so low
I'm not feeling it
And thanks to my intuition
Got me dodging a collision
At last
You're the one that sent the message
I don't need you at my beck and call
What makes you so sure
One day
You're the one that sent the message
I reciprocated
No, ball's not in your court
And you wonder why I
Didn't come back
Don't wanna think twice
On the contact
Another wild ride
Another nightcap
I gave you one try
And you wonder why I
Didn't come back
Don't wanna think twice
On the contact
Another wild ride
Another nightcap
I gave you one try
'Til you're making me your alibi
Didn't come back
Don't wanna think twice
On the contact
Another wild ride
Another nightcap
I gave you one try
And you wonder why I
Didn't come back
Don't wanna think twice
On the contact
Another wild ride
Another nightcap
I gave you one try
'Til you're making me your alibi
One time, one time, one try
'Til I am your alibi
One time, one time, one try
'Til I am your alibi
One time, one time, one try
'Til I am your alibi
One time, one time, one try
You're the one all alone
You're the one all alone
You're the one all alone
You're the one all alone
