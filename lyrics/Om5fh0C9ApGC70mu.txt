Tell me do you remember?
A time when everything was good
When it was much simpler
Nostalgia hurts more than it should
You can say, I lost my way
The path I've taken seems to have led me astray
But you can't say that although lost that I've always not just been me

Cause I am the faith departed
I am the one who needs to change
Tired of always being broken hearted
Pick up the pieces finish what I started
I am the one who needs to change

Wont you take me back??
I can't stand the way this feels
So sick of going through the motions
Take me back to when my dreams were something real

I apologize
I expect nothing less
To be treated the same
To Get what I give back

Cause I am the faith departed
I am the one who needs to change
Tired of always being broken hearted
Pick up the pieces finish what I started
I am the one who needs to change

It's easier to blame you
But I'm the one to blame

Cause I am the faith departed
I am the one who needs to change
Tired of always being broken hearted
Pick up the pieces finish what I started
I am the one who needs to change
