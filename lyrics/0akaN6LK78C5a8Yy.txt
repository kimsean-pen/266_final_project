I take picture of you
especially best of you
Don't care if it's not really pretty
Just record now this time to
share this feelings with you

You took my time with you
with my very first kiss
Don't mind if it ain't really romantic
From my head to toe, I feel the love from you
Wanna sing this moment for us

This love could make me alone,
but I know we'll be together
now or forever,
With you I'd float everywhere
with you I'd ...

I play my songs with you
It's ordinary to us
Don't care what would people want from me
Just record now this time to
remember this feelings with you

You took care of me
with your special cure
Don't mind if it costs a lot of my heart
From my finger to ear,
I feel the warm from you
Wanna tell this moment for you

This love could make me blue,
but I know we'll be together,
now or forever,
With you I'd float everywhere,
with you I'd.
