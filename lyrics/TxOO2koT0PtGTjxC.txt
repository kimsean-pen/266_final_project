I can't move on, baby doll
Waitin' on calls
Flippin' through stations
I'm outclassed and it's outrageous
I take it all, baby doll
Whatever's been
Weighin' you down

Find me on Miami concrete
Lookin' for somebody different 'cause my daddy was a pimp
My mama had her issues but I miss her anyway
Oh baby doll

Please don't call me for the wrong reasons
We both know exactly what I'm thinkin'
Weeks pass and I never grow tired
'Cause I never said never and I barely ever lie
I'm on a roll to an original place
In outer space
I didn't make it up, but you can't find it on a phone
Or a globe
And I can take you with me if you really wanna go
Oh baby doll
I can't move on

I can't move on, baby doll
Waitin' on calls
Flippin' through stations
I'm outclassed and it's outrageous
I take it all, baby doll
Whatever's been
Weighin' you down
