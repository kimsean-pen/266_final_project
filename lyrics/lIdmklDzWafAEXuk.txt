It takes a girl to understand
Just how to win she know she can
I think it's fair she know she can
I think it's fair who wears the pants
What boy could stand a chance?

She make it look easy (ohh)
In control completely
She'll get the best of you every single time
Thought by now, you realize you should...

Never underestimate a girl
Gets anything she wants
She's never gonna stop
(You know it, we know it)
Never underestimate a girl
She's always got a plan
The world is in her hands

Don't try to win the game
You're only gonna lose
