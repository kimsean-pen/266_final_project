Hallucinate in high fidelity
The pieces of a plan
Extraction of the highest quality
Blood from my own hand
A line of lyric looping through my head
Nobody listening
It doesn't really matter anymore
Yes it doesn't mean a thing

I've gotta let go
I've gotta get straight
Why'd you have to make it so hard
Let me get away

An eye for chasing wonders to behold
Statements so profound
A place to bury everything I did
And burn it to the ground
A fire illuminates the final scene
The past repeats itself
I cannot tell the difference anymore
I cannot trust myself

I've gotta let go
I've gotta get straight
Why'd you have to make it so hard
Let me get away
I've gotta let go
I've gotta get straight
Why'd you have to make it so hard
Let me get away

I think
I could
Lose myself in here
I think
I could
Lose myself in here
I think
I could
Lose myself in here
I think
I could
Lose myself in here

I've gotta let go
I've gotta get straight
Why'd you have to make it so hard
Let me get away
Got to let him go
Find another way
Why'd you have to make it so hard
Let me get away
