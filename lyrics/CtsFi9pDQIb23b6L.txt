M-m-money
M-I want my money
M-m-money
M-I want my money

Yo, this is a song about my money
You know, 'cause I love money and I want my money
To the bass sound, woo

You see me popping glasses in the club
Oh yeah, that's me!
And I'm so sassy pass my side
Looking fire in the spot
Get your money
That's my dough, that's my dough, that's my dough
I just wanna go bonkers, go bonkers, go bonkers, go bonkers

I am the queen of the nights
I find I just love the boys
And I'mma focus the crocus
'Cause I'm in love with his toys
I wanna gang gang
'Cause I luv the bang bang
I tell you this how much I love you on this land

I just wanna big time my money
They're so yummy jummy like honey
I just wanna big time my money
I'm so yummy jummy like honey

I just wanna big time my money
They're so yummy jummy like honey
I just wanna big time my money
I'm so yummy jummy like honey

I like femme banging digits in the club
All the chicas!
On the base of golden cup
I can show you my close-up
And I tell you
That's my butt, that's my butt, that's my butt
I just wanna go bonkers, go bonkers, go bonkers, go bonkers

I am the queen of the nights
I find I just love the boys
And I'mma fill up my big cup
And I'm in love with his toys
I wanna gang gang
'Cause I luv the bang bang
I tell you this how much I love you on this land
I just wanna big time my money
Let's go, I just wanna-

I just wanna big time my money
They're so yummy jummy like honey
I just wanna big time my money
I'm so yummy jummy like honey, woo hoo
