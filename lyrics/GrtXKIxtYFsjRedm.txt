Teacher moves me from seat to seat, huh
All I do is talk
"Teacher, may I use the bathroom please?
Yes, it's an emergency"

Teacher makes me take my test first
I'll take your test
Trapped inside this hourglass
Thoughts of crass

I'll give you the answers you want to hear
But I won't conform
Unlike my mindless vacant peers
They're the norm

Exactly what do you want me to say?
Exactly what do you want from me?
Exactly what do you want me to be now?

Please classify me
Force me to succeed
Change identity
And watch me change

Finished, may I use the bathroom please?
Yes, still an emergency
Come on, cut me some slack
Promise, I'll be right back

Just let me go this one last time
And I'll never ask again
Just let me go this one last time
And I'll never ask again
Please, teacher
