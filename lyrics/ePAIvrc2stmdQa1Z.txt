You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby cause in the dark
You can see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
That I'll always be your friend
Took an oath I'm a stick it out till the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella

Hey hey baby baby

These fancy things, will never come in between
You're part of my entity, here for Infinity
When the war has took it's part
When the world has dealt it's cards
If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart
Because

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
That I'll always be your friend
Took an oath I'm a stick it out till the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella

Hey hey baby baby

You can run into my Arms
It's okay don't be alarmed
Come into Me
There's no distance in between our love
Gonna let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more

You can stand, you can stand, you can stand, you can stand, you can you can, stand stand

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
That I'll always be your friend
Took an oath I'm a stick it out till the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella

Hey hey baby baby

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
That I'll always be your friend
Took an oath I'm a stick it out till the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand, you can stand, you can stand...
Oh you can stand
You can stand, you can stand, you can stand...
Umbrella
