You went into the kitchen cupboard
Got yourself another hour
And you gave half of it to me
We sat there looking at the faces
Of the strangers in the pages
Until we knew them mathematically

They were in our minds
Until forever
But we didn't mind
We didn't know better

So we made our own computer
Out of macaroni pieces
And it did our thinking
While we lived our lives
It counted up our feelings
And divided them up even
And it called our calculation
Perfect love

Didn't even know
That love was bigger
Didn't even know
That love was so, so
Hey hey hey hey

Hey this fire, this fire
I'm burning us up
Hey this fire, this fire
I'm burning us up
Oh, oo oo oo, oo oo oo oo

So we made the hard decision
And we each made an incision
Past our muscles and our bones
Saw our hearts were little stones

Pulled 'em out they weren't beating
And we weren't even bleeding
As we lay them on our granite counter top

We beat 'em up against each other
We beat 'em up against each other
We struck 'em hard against each other
We struck 'em so hard, so hard 'til they sparked

Hey this fire, this fire
I'm burning us up
Hey this fire, this fire
I'm burning us up
Hey this fire, this fire
I'm burning us up
Oh, oo oo oo, oo oo oo oo
