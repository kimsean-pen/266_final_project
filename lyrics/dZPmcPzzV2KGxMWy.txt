Yea we fell, we fell so hard
We sold out
Yea, we fade and fade away
We never cut loose
There's nobody but you
Nobody else
(Nobody else)

Yea we feel, we feel
All of the same things
You find, you find
All of my secrets
Lights up deep inside of me
I know you're always right, always right

So save your words
I'm bleeding inside
You see you're hurt
Got nowhere left to hide
And all this time
You're slipping away from me
Bring me to my knees

Now I'm lying on the floor
With no one else to blame
Torn apart and knowing
That I messed it up again
No, I don't recognize
Just what we used to be
And I can see you staring at the seams
We cover up the scars
And never let them go
Stitch up our broken hearts
This love is sewn
(This love is sewn)Yea we try, we try
To leave them behind
All our mistakes
We stumble through a million fights
Every time we twist the knife we forgive, never forget
Never forget

So save your words
I'm bleeding inside
You see you're hurt
Got nowhere left to hide
And all this time
You're slipping away from me
Bring me to my knees

Now I'm lying on the floor
With no one else to blame
Torn apart and knowing
That I messed it up again
No, I don't recognize
Just what we used to be
And I can see you staring at the seams
We cover up the scars
And never let them go
Stitch up our broken hearts
This love is sewn
(Sewn...)
This love is sewn
(Sewn...)
This love is sewn
(Sewn...)
This love is sewn
(Sewn...)
This love is sewn

Yea we fell, we fell so hard
We sold out
Yea, we fade and fade away
We never cut loose
There's nobody but you
Nobody else

Now I'm lying on the floor
With no one else to blame
Torn apart and knowing
That I messed it up again
No, I don't recognize
Just what we used to be
And I can see you staring at the seams
We cover up the scars
And never let them go
Stitch up our broken hearts
This love is sewn

This love is sewn, this love is sewn
This love is sewn, this love is sewn
This love is sewn, this love is sewn
This love is sewn, this love is sewn
