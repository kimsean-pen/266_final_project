Beneath this poison rage
We dance upon the grave this night
Discard humanity
We crave insanity this night

Yeah, yeah

Through this curtain call
We'll collide and fall
We're all victimized
And dehumanized

But we hold on
More than a miracle, we die for the prayin'
Hold on
The fight of our lives, the signs of the time

Bleeding we can't unbound
This new word terminates my soul, my soul
Shooting the loaded gun
Looking inside your vertigo

Hey, yeah yeah yeah

Sippin' cyanide
Bodies damnified
Too much time to hate
Reevaluate

But we hold on
More than a miracle, we die for the prayin'
Hold on
The fight of our lives, the signs of the time

If we hold on
Something has got to give,
Now hear what I'm saying
Hold on
The fight of our lives, the signs of the time

We hold on
More than a miracle, we die for the prayin'
Hold on
The fight of our lives, the signs of the time

Hold on
Something has got to give
Now hear what I'm saying
Hold on
The fight of our lives, the signs of the time
Signs of the time
