You are my friend,
I never knew it 'til then
My friend, my friend

You hold my hand,
You might not say a word
But I see your tears when I show my pain

You're--- my, my friend
I never knew it 'til then
My friend
I feel your love,
When you're not near
It helps me make it knowing you care

The thought of you helps me carryon
When I feel all hope is gone
I see the world wit brand new eyes
Your love has made me realize
My future looks bright to me,
Oh because you are my friend
Da, da, da, da (ad lib)

I've been looking around and you were here all the time.
Da, da, da (ad lib)
I've been around and around and around and around
Da, da, da
I've been looking around and you were here all the time
(Repeat)
