He wants to know
What it feels like
To mess around, mess around
She wants to know
What it feels like
To settle down, settle down

He's got the money but
Oh, it's not enough
He wants to pounce
He wants to pounce

Never know if he's giving you up
Are you just not good enough
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooo - ooh ooh ooh ooh

She wants to know why he's not home
Oh I bet money, money, money I bet
He's at the Sexotheque
He never answers the phone
Oh I bet money, money, money I bet
He's at the Sexotheque

He wants to go
Where the red lights
Shine so bright, shine so bright
He wants to know
Why he feels so cold inside, cold inside

He turns and looks around
He doesn't hear a sound
No ones around, no ones around

Never know if he's giving you up
Are you just not good enough
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooo - ooh ooh ooh ooh

She wants to know why he's not home
Oh I bet money, money, money I bet
He's at the Sexotheque
He never answers the phone
Oh I bet money, money, money I bet
He's at the Sexotheque

She wants to know why he's not home
Oh I bet money, money, money I bet
He's at the Sexotheque
He never answers the phone
Oh I bet money, money, money I bet
He's at the Sexotheque

She wants to know why he's not home
Oh I bet money, money, money I bet
He's at the Sexotheque
He never answers the phone
Oh I bet money, money, money I bet
He's at the Sexotheque

(I bet, oh, I bet, I bet)
She wants to know why he's not home
Oh I bet money, money, money I bet
He's at the Sexotheque

I bet, oh, I bet,
He's at the Sexotheque
He's at the Sexotheque

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooo - ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooo - ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooo - ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooo - ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooo - ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooo - ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooo - ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooo

He's at the Sexotheque
