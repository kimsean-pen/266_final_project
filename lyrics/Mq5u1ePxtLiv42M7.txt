When you are in love
Ah, you feel the stars above
There's no devil in her eyes
There's no darkness in disguise

But when you are alone
A kiss can turn your heart to stone
Hearts breaking in the night
There's a devil in her eyes

Oh, it's serious, so serious
A kiss that caught the wind made you delirious
Oh, it's serious, so serious
Take her in your arms, don't be afraid
Never be afraid

When you are in love
All the stars burn bright above
There's a kindness in her eyes
There's no darkness in disguise

Oh, but when you are alone
Oh, your heart it turns to stone
Hearts breaking in the night
There's a devil in her eyes

Oh, it's serious, so serious
A kiss that caught the wind made you delirious
Oh, it's serious, so serious
Take her in your arms, don't be afraid
Never be afraid

Oh, it's serious, so serious
A kiss that caught the wind made you delirious
Oh, it's serious, so serious
So take her in your arms, don't be afraid
Never be afraid
