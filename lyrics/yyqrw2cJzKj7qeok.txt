You're a good woman and a good friend
You got a good heart even when it's busted and bent
Lipstick and perfume, under gram queen
Wearing loneliness like a costume for the whole world to see

And if your money runs out
And your good looks fade
May your kindness remain
Oh, may your kindness remain

Broke on a barstool, throwin' your paycheck away
On overpriced booze, slots, and valet
Fortune might buy diamonds, all shiny and new
But it can't buy you happiness or love, that is true

And if your money runs out
And your good looks fade
May your kindness remain
Oh, may your kindness remain

The richest of people
Aren't rich with Elvis, cars, or fame
No they're not rich with something
That can be bought or arranged
No, it's kindness that makes them beautiful
And a kind heart don't cost a dime
It's a gif that keeps giving
For the rest of your life

And if your money runs out
And your good looks fade
May your kindness remain
Oh, may your kindness remain
May your kindness remain
Oh, may your kindness remain
