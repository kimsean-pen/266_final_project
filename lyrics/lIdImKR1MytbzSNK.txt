Not checking up
Not checking up

It's the only day
I'm off work
It's the only time
I have at all

Too busy, only day
I'm off work
It's the only time
I have at all

I'll be pulling out
I wanna see what her strength is
Even if you don't
Talk to me at all

I still wanna know you
Some way

I'm not checking up
I'm not checking up
I'm not checking up
Not checking up

It's the only day
I'm off work
It's the only time
I have at all

It's the only day
I'm off work
It's the only time
I have at all

It's the only day
I have off work
It's the only time
I have at all

I'm not checking up
I'm not checking up
I'm, I'm not checking up
Not checking up

I'll be pulling out
I wanna see what her strength is
Talking to your friends
On the other side

I still wanna talk to you
