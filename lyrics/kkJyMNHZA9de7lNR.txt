Down with the time, light as a feather
That way you waited, that is, believe me, no better
hear when I call you the better.
Where is your heart?
I'm coming over
Heavy with love, with it all over my body
Making new love to somebody.
Now that I see as I reclouded
My heart has never beated louder
I can't believe that I doubted,
I doubted you

Taking my hand look into my heart
I'm coming out, I'm coming out
Pulsing it in love
Pulsing it into one
Forcing it into us!
Over my head, into my heart
I'm coming out, I'm coming out
Pulsing it in love
Pulsing it into one
Forcing into us!

All of your dreams only come out at night
There where you are, none of your colors are daylight
Though they be longing for daylight
Where is your heart?
I'm coming over!
With love over my body
Making new love to someone
Love to somebody new!

Taking my hand into my heart
I'm coming out, I'm coming out
Pulsing it in love
Pulsing it into one
Forcing into us!
Over my head, into my heart
I'm coming out, I'm coming out
Pulsing it in love
Pulsing it into one
Forcing into us!
