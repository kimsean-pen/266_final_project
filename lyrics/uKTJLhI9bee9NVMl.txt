You got those eyes starin' to my soul
You get that smile when I'm giving you my all
You're the brighter side of things
You're the lighter side of life
And all the joy that you bring
Is why I need you in my life
(But) Can I call you home
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
I just wanna let you know
In my mind I call you home
In my mind I call you home
The only thing I ever knew is that I never know
I've had my time in the sun and now I gotta go
You're the brighter side of things
You're the lighter side of life
And all the joy that you bring
Is why I need you in my life
(But) Can I call you home
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
I just wanna let you know
In my mind I call you home
In my mind...
In my mind...
In my mind...
In my mind...
(But) Can I call you home
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
I just wanna let you know
In my mind I call you home
(And now) Can I call you home
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
I just wanna let you know
In my mind I call you home
In my mind I call you home
In my mind I call you home
