I'm the one man army
I'm the one man army
Of disease
I'm the one man army
I'm the one man army
Of disease

The creation that is sickness
This is time to destroy everything and never rebuild
This is time to destroy everything and never rebuild

I am the disease
I am the disease
I'm a disease
To the world
I'm a disease
To the world
I'm the plague of
Disaster

And I'll continue to move foward
Like the monsters of money
Crime, crime and deceit
Crime, crime and deceit

This is time to destroy everything and never rebuild
This is time to destroy everything and never rebuild
I'm the one man army
I'm the one man army
Of disease

We've brought this world to its knees
We've brought this world to its knees

Now it's spread like wildfire
Now it's spread like wildfire
Now it's spread like wildfire
Now it's spread like wildfire
Wildfire

This world is dead, let it die
This world is dead, let it die
This world is dead, let it die
This world is dead, let it die

A fucking sick disturbing race
A closed-minded existence
A fucking sick disturbing race
A closed-minded existence

We are the fucking sick
We are the fucking sick
It's the plague of us
And we're the disease
Of this disaster
You call your world

This world is dead let it die
This world is dead let it die
So shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up
And let the killing begin
