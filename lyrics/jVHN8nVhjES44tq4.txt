You and I in a little toy shop
Buy a bag of balloons with the money we've got
Set them free at the break of dawn
'til one by one, they were gone
Back at base, bugs in the software
Flash the message, something's out there
Floating in the summer sky
99 red balloons go by.

99 red balloons floating in the summer sky
Panic bells, it's red alert
There's something here from somewhere else
The war machine springs to life
Opens up one eager eye
Focusing it on the sky
As 99 red balloons go by.

99 decision street, 99 ministers meet
To worry, worry, super-scurry
Call out the troops now in a hurry
This is what we've waited for
This is it boys, this is war

The president is on the line
As 99 red balloons go by.

99 kriegsminister
Streichholz und benzinkanister
Hielten sich fuer schlaue leute
Witterten schon fette beute
Riefen: krieg und wollten macht
Mann, wer haette das gedacht
Dass es einmal soweit kommt
Wegen 99 luftballons

99 dreams i have had
In every one a red balloon
It's all over and i'm standin' pretty
In the dust that was a city
If i could find a souvenier
Just to prove the world was here...
And here it is, a red balloon
I think of you and let it go.
