Laetitia, you destroy me,
So I can't see why I feel so lonely
When you and me could be forever
Perfectly perfect together, I know

Broken down in my dead bedroom
Stuttering to pictures of you
I know that you can always see me
I saw you staring through my TV last night

So I'll leave the door open all night
In case you decide you want to stop on by
Because you've got to know who's been singing that
Song on the radio
The one that goes

My friends all call me crazy
Cause I stay up late anticipating
And planning for the day I sweep you off your feet
I'd never leave you alone

Laetitia, you got my hand shaking
I'm begging you oh baby please stop breaking my heart
Because I got the feeling
That you and I will never really get it on

So I'll leave the door open all night
In case you decide you want to stop on by
Because you've got to know who's been singing that song on the radio
The one that goes

Girl, come to me
The only broken-hearted loser you'll ever need
Or I'll be left alone forever with my magazines
Come to me
The only broken-hearted loser you'll ever need
Or I'll be left alone forever with my magazines

Girl come to me (you've got my hands shakin)
The only broken-hearted loser you'll ever need
Please come to me (you've got my hands shakin)
The only broken-hearted loser you'll ever need
Come to me (you've got my hands shakin)
The only broken-hearted loser you'll ever need
Or I'll be left alone forever

Laetitia, you destroy me
So I can't see why I feel so lonely
When you and me could be forever
Perfectly perfect together
I know
