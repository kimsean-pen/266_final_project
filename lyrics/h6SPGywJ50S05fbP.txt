It's been such a long time coming
I'd thought you'd understand
That's over, hate of the last
Will be joining in the sand

But it's simple you were wrong
You must have known that we didn't not belong

I know you thought I'd sold my soul
But you never told me to my face
I just had to let you go
And blow this shit away

Here we go again
