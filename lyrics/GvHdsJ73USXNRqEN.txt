I don't smoke
except for when I'm missing you
to remember your mouth, how it
tasted true
and I don't smoke
except for after I've held you, baby
being with you
makes the flame burn good

so if you need to be mean
be mean to me
I can take it and put it inside of me
if your hands need to break
more than trinkets in your room
you can lean on my arm
as you break my heart

I'm what's left of when we
swam under the moon
now the rest of my days are just
waiting for when
you come down and tell me
I was meant for you, baby
being with you
makes the flame burn good

if you need to be mean
be mean to me
I can take it and put it inside of me
if your hands need to break
more than trinkets in your room
you can lean on my arm
as you break my heart

just don't leave me alone
wondering where you are
I am stronger than you give me
credit for

if your hands need to break
more than trinkets in your room
you can lean on my arm
as you break my heart
