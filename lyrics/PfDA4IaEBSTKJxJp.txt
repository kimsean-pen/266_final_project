Drawing hearts on the foggy glass
New love, chase away my past
Nothing but the open road, saddle up, here we go

First winter here in your arms
Flames rising as we fall like the stars
Making angels in the snow, warm fuzzy, frozen through
Is this a dream?

Don't wake me up
If this is love
Please, let me be

Swept completely off my feet
This snow globe dream is telling me
This Christmas it all became real
Don't wake me please
From this winter dream

Winter dream
Winter dream

Built a fire to escape the cold
Ben Crosby on the stereo
Chasing letter on my skin, slowly start sinking in
You love me

Don't wake me up
If this is love
Please, let me be

Swept completely off my feet
This snow globe dream is telling me
This Christmas it all became real
Don't wake me please
From this winter...

Dreaming dreams while I'm wide awake
The tree, the lights, staying up late
It's true
I'm in love with you

Swept completely off my feet
This snow globe dream is telling me
This Christmas it all became real
Don't wake me please
From this winter dream

Winter dream
Winter dream
