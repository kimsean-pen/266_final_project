And do you still touch her like you do
Kiss her all over in the way I kissed with you
And when you sleep with her do you sometimes think of me
Not if you love her in the way I see

I had to be free
Had to be free
It's all that I wanted

I wanted to see
Wanted to be
Alone if I needed
I had to be free
Had to be free
From feelings that haunted

I wanted to see
Wanted to be
Free

And then in the evening light when the bars of freedom fall
I watch the two of you in the shadows on the wall
And when the darkness steals some of the choices from my hand
Then will I begin to understand

I had to be free
Had to be free
It's all that I wanted
I wanted to see
Wanted to be
Alone if I needed
I had to be free
Had to be free
From feelings that haunted
I wanted to see
Wanted to be
Free

I had to be free
Had to be free
It's all that I wanted
I wanted to see
Wanted to be
Alone if I needed
I had to be free
Had to be free
From feelings that haunted
I wanted to see
Wanted to be
Free
