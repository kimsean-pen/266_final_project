Why is there you when there are few people around
Making me feel good?
Why is there me when air is free? Some I can see
Better than I should
There's only us simply because thinking of us
Makes us both happy

I think of you every way
Yesterday and today
I think of things that we do
All the way, every day

Stand in the sea, sing songs for me, sing happily
Making you feel good
Watchin' your eyes, feelin' your sighs, saying goodbyes
Better than I could
There's only us simply because thinking of us
Makes us both happy

I think of you every way
Yesterday and today
I think of nothing but you
Things we do, things we do
