What's it gonna take
Are we gonna forever
Make the same mistake

I wanna know
Will you take a stand
Will you raise a hand
For your brother's sake

You talk about the deluge
You talk about centrifuge
You got something to prove
Tell me - who's eyes you gonna use

And I... yeah I
What's it gonna take
And you... yeah you
What's it gonna be

I wanna know...

What's it gonna be
Gotta another theory
You want me to hear
Taking your refuge in your reason
Just to beat the fear
That we don't know why we're here

Even cold hard facts
Have got a way of changing
Their stripes in the light of a new day
The world we hold so tight and true
Turn it on it's head

And I...

I wanna know...

Living under pretense
Always on the defense
Always on the fence
Tell me, what's it gonna be
