Heavy eyes on the road of life
Cities pass me by like a flash of who I used to be
The sky is bleeding but I cannot see
Ironically you spoke about painting my picture and colouring me in
But the picture you drew didn't include me, it was only you
I guess I'm just so fucking tired
It's like I'm daydreaming at night and sleepwalking at day
I can't find my pace nor the strength to stay
You always said I should be open, honest and sincere
I guess this is a start
So for the next 40 minutes, I will speak from the heart
And the truth is, maybe I don't deserve to be happy
Light up the darkness!

Everywhere I turn, I see landscapes in grey
It's a colourless world when the blind lead the way
Our endeavours won't carry us back
The essence of hope still lies on the track
Will we see a new day in this dead and filthy world?
I hear the sound of a thousand screams
Break through the silence of shattered dreams
Don't ever stray from the path they say
Don't you diverge from the masses

I have seen the rise of a thousand suns in front of me
But I never felt the warming touch from the sky above me
I have seen the rise of a thousand suns in front of me
But I never felt the warming touch from the sky above me
Will the dark clouds swallow me?
Will the dark clouds swallow me?

I feel the sickness of this world feeding on me
My horizon will fade away
Light of tomorrow come today
And as the sun slowly sets tonight
I feel the dark clouds swallow me
A last string of hope gets buried
Death runs in my black veins
Death runs in my black veins

I have seen the rise of a thousand suns in front of me
But I never felt the warming touch from the sky above me
Will the dark clouds swallow me?
Will the dark clouds swallow me?

Let the light of tomorrow come today
We've been hanging on forever on a spark that never came
Let the light of tomorrow come today
We've been hanging on forever on a spark that never came
Let the light of tomorrow come today
We've been hanging on forever on a spark that never came
Let the light of tomorrow come today
We've been hanging on forever on a spark that never came
