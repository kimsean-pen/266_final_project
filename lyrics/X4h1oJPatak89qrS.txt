Shattered dreams of days gone by
Makes me want to sit right down and cry
All the plans I had and what it turned to
Just shattered dreams

Yesterday was long ago
When I first met you, you were my dream
All in vain, and it only brought me pain
Yes, and shattered dreams

Your goodbye shattered it all
For early this morning, blues brought me a call
Now all I had is gone, and all that's left
Is my shattered dreams

Shattered dreams

Shattered dreams, baby

Shattered dreams
Shattered dreams
Shattered dreams

Shattered dreams
My shattered dreams
