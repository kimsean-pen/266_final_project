I don't need a hundred roses waiting by the front door
I don't need a fancy house in the hills
You could rope the moon and bring me all the stars in heaven
It won't change how I feel.

You don't have to be a modern day Shakespeare
You don't have to be anything you're not
You don't have to give me diamonds to impress me
Just give me your heart.

Make me feel loved
Make me feel beautiful
Make me feel dance around the room Cinderella kinda magical
Make me believe I'm all that you'll ever need
Hold me close and make me feel a million kinds of wonderful
Baby your touch, is more than enough
Make me feel loved.

It's the way you bring me coffee in the morning
And how you know just what not to say
I don't need you to try and fix everything when I've had a bad day.

Make me feel loved
Make me feel beautiful
Make me feel dance around the room Cinderella kinda magical
Make me believe I'm all that you'll ever need
Hold me close and make me feel a million kinds of wonderful
Baby your touch, is more than enough
Make me feel loved.

Make me feel loved
Make me feel beautiful
Make me feel dance around the room Cinderella kinda magical
Make me believe I'm all that you'll ever need
Hold me close and make me feel a million kinds of wonderful
Baby your touch, is more than enough
Make me feel loved.
