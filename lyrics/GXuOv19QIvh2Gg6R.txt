Dragonfly in the pouring rain
Cast a shadow on halcyon days
Chasing rainbows, running the storm
Unaware that your wings would be torn

Sometimes I think I'm going nowhere at all
Stuck in the shelter with my back to the wall
Then I remember how it felt to come down
So I'm taking my time and I'm not going out

Until it's safe to fly
I could be waiting 'til the summer sky
But I'm standing by
Until I'm cleared to go
I won't be shaken by the undertow
I'm under your wing this time
And I know there's a storm outside
So I'll stay 'til I know it's safe
Safe to fly

Aeronaut in a heavy cloud
Staying up with the radio down
Chasing rainbows you'd rather forget
Unaware of the trouble ahead

Sometimes I think I'm learning nothing at all
Once I've recovered I just stumble and fall
'Til I've discovered what the journey's about
I'm preparing for flight, and I'll weather it out

Until it's safe to fly
I could be waiting 'til the summer sky
But I'm standing by
Until I'm cleared to go
I won't be shaken by the undertow
I'm biding my time

Sometimes I think I'm going nowhere at all
Stuck in the shelter with my back to the wall
Then I remember how it felt to come down
So I'm taking my time and I'm not going out

Until it's safe to fly
I could be waiting 'til the summer sky
But I'm standing by
Until I'm cleared to go
I won't be shaken by the undertow
I'm under your wing this time
And I know there's a storm outside
So I'll stay 'til I know it's safe
Safe to fly
