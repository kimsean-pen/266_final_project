You put the weight of the world on my shoulders
If only you were a little bit older
You know that I can handle all of your shit
But baby I'm so, so over it

I've had enough
You know that I don't need ya
But you stole my love
You're treating me just like a diamond in the rough
But baby, you stole my love
You stole my love

I thought it might be fun to go for somebody young
But you took everything, even the air off my lungs
You could never rest and you're never pleased
That's why I decided to leave

I've had enough
You know that I don't need ya
But you stole my love
You're treating me just like a diamond in the rough
But baby, you stole my love
You stole my love

I'll make you happy, I can make you laugh
I'll give you lie
Don't make me your everything
The only good in your life
I'll be your precious stone
I'll be your treasure
But it won't make me brilliant
So I'll just crumble under the pressure

I've had enough
You know that I don't need ya
But you stole my love
You're treating me just like a diamond in the rough
But baby, you stole my love

I've had enough
You know that I don't need ya
But you stole my love
You're treating me just like a diamond in the rough
But baby, you stole my love
Baby, you stole my love
