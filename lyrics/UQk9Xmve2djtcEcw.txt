She don't like small places
Give her highways and by-ways
And don't get stuck in her head
And it's been so long
And I will read into everything you don't say
All of your silent ways

I'm a dog lying down on a warm bit of pavement
Checking this collar to see what the name is
Think that it's worth it?
Well, I hope that you're right
You're falling asleep on the red eye tonight

And you know that you're looking well
Won't you come through my door asking 'how was your day?'
Well you know that I'm still a dog
And I'm trusting my nose
Will it show me the way?

I'm glad that you're still here
Won't you hold up a candle?
I'm stumbling in the dark
And when I needed hope
I remind myself that at least I got one thing right
It will always be right

I'm a dog lying down on a warm bit of pavement
Checking this collar to see what the name is
Think that it's worth it?
Well, I hope that you're right
You're falling asleep on the red eye tonight

And you know that you're looking well
Won't you come from my door asking 'how was your day?'
Well you know that I'm still a dog
And I'm trusting my nose
Will it show me the way?

Won't you get out while you can?
Won't you cover your eyes?
If you're tired, I'll see ya
Won't you get out while you can?
Try something yourself

Let's talk in the morning
Oh, baby it's late
Can we talk in the morning?
Oh, baby it's late
Can we talk in the morning?
Tell me when
Tell me when
Oh, baby it's late
Can we talk in the morning?
Tell me when
Tell me when
Oh, baby it's late
Baby, it's late
Tell me when
Tell me when
