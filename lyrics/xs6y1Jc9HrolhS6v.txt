We are a mercenary band
Led by Griffith the White Hawk
United we stand under our flag
Into battle we bring the storm

We are the

Death of the battlefield - We will return
Death of the battlefield - Victorious
Death of the battlefield - We are the Band of the Hawk

Our enemies now fall we're marching tall
Over their bodies and bone
No matter how strong those castles of stone are
We shall conquer them all

We are the

Death of the battlefield - We will return
Death of the battlefield - Victorious
Death of the battlefield - We are the Band of the Hawk

We are the

Death of the battlefield - Death of the battlefield
Death of the battlefield - Death of the battlefield
Death of the battlefield - Yes, we are the Band of the Hawk

The nobles are raging
Soon they'll be fading
Locked up and burning away
Death by betrayal
From one of their own
And the White Hawk disappears into the night
The White Hawk disappears into the night
The White Hawk disappears into the night
The White Hawk disappears into the night

I, I shall die with the Hawks by my side
I will not betray I'll stay to the end - To the end!

We are the

Death of the battlefield - We will return
Death of the battlefield - Victorious
Death of the battlefield - We are the Band of the Hawk

We are the

Death of the battlefield - Death of the battlefield
Death of the battlefield - Death of the battlefield
Death of the battlefield - We are the Band of the Hawk
We are the Band of the Hawk
We are the Band of the Hawk
Yes, We are the Band of the Hawk
