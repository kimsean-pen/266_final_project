Faintest snow keep falling, falling
Hands around your waist
Nameless, standing cold, standing cold

Like a breath, like a breath
Take in restraint like a breath
My lungs are so numb from holding back

Walk close to the fence
Feel it hit your clothes
Turn and smile nice
Smile, say good night, say good night

In a breath, in a breath
Simple discourse breaks you clean...
Simple discourse breaks you clean in half

Regret to try it once
But then you know it's your move
Settle for less again
Again
