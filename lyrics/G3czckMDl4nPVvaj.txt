Grind down.
Blind taste.
Dripping ideas turn against our will.
Swallow the chosen soul.
One Animal.
Once lived... for life.
Human mist rise.
Sweet devouring teeth are sharpened.
Swallow the chosen soul.
One Animal.
Once lived... for life.
One Animal.
Once lived... for life.
The fifth resonating host... sweaty palmed inside constant alert.
Blinking around the bubble of the paranoid.
We are all that's left. We will be enough?
One Animal.
Once lived... for life.
One Animal.
Once lived... for life.
Scour the earth. Turn the dirt red.
(This can't be our lifeline)
Anchored mind wind... across the fog.
We disgrace the pupils sight.
A homeless meat... the street markets replaced their souls.
ripping our oldest thoughts... society has me out cold.
It has me out in the cold.
Move the flesh over this rotten bone.
One more day.
This can't be our lifeline...
