Come close, step inside
Bring me news from the dying world
Contagious and careless
You're spreading your disease among us
Warm sweat, no regret
All you see is the TV set
While people around you
Are dying like flies

Non-stop violence, they feed us cascades
Of non-believers dying in the sand
Feeding us with violence, we face the fall of man
Believe me, and catch me if you can

Catch me if you can!

Come close, step inside
Bring me news from the dying world
Contagious and careless
You're spreading your disease among us
White noise in your ears
Your eyes look like monitors
But what you need is silence
And a positive vibe.

Not your TV!

Non-stop violence, they feed us cascades
Of non-believers dying in the sand
Feeding us with violence, we face the fall of man
Believe me, and catch me if you can

Catch me if you can...

So I took shelter in tomorrow
Tomorrow will bring a brand new day
Think I make it right tomorrow
Think I need more sleep today

Lets make peace again tomorrow
I need a will to stay away
I guess I'll always hate tomorrow
Until it's far away... away...
