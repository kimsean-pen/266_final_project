I need the violence on the radio
I need a murder sound just to let me know
There's no one talking to me, but I'm talking back
And every word's a ghost I keep looking at

It's another song
Then it's gone
It's just another song
And then it's gone

I'll be your innocent lie, lie, lie
I'll be your last mistake (you take, you take)
Everything a little lie, lie, lie
I never really can

I'll be the hollow chase of a tragic line
It got the kids in tow just to feed their mind
But sniffing only can pull apart
It takes a dead-end soul to kill a dead-end heart

It's another song
Then it's gone
It's just another song
And then it's gone

I'll be your innocent lie, lie, lie
I'll be the last mistake (you take, you take)
Everything a little lie, lie, lie
I never really can

I'm gonna tell you how it feels
I'm gonna tell you how it was
I'm waiting on a call, yeah
I'm waiting on a vision
I'm waiting on the phone but this dead song said
I'm waiting on the call
And I'm waiting on a vision
I'm waiting on the phone and this dead song said
Been waiting on the phone and this dead song said
Been waiting on the phone and this dead song said
Been waiting on the phone, the dead song said
Been waiting on the phone and this dead song said

I'll be your innocent lie, lie, lie
I'll be the last mistake (you take, you take)
Everything a little lie, lie, lie
