In a nightmare
I am falling from the ceiling into bed beside you
You're asleep
I'm screaming, shoving you to try to wake you up
And like before
You've got no interest in the life you live when you're awake
Your dreams still follow storylines
Like fictions you would make

So I lie down against your back
Until we're both back in the hospital
But now it's not a cancer ward
We're sleeping in the morgue
Men and women in blue and white
They are singing all around you
With heavy shovels holding earth
You're being buried to you neck
In that hospital bed
Being buried quite alive now
I'm trying to dig you out
But all you want is to be buried there together

You're screaming,
And cursing,
And angry,
And hurting me,
And then smiling,
And crying,
Apologizing

I've woken up, I'm in our bed
But there's no breathing body there beside me
Someone must have taken you while I was stuck asleep
But I know better as my eyes adjust
You've been gone for quite awhile now
And I don't work there in the hospital
They had to let me go

When I try to move my arms sometimes
They weigh too much to lift
I think you buried me awake
My one and only parting gift
But you return to me at night
Just when I think I may have fallen asleep
Your face is up against mine
And I'm too terrified to speak

You're screaming,
And cursing,
And angry,
And hurting me,
And then smiling,
And crying,
Apologizing

You're screaming,
And cursing,
And angry,
And hurting me,
And then smiling,
And crying,
Apologizing

You're screaming,
And cursing,
And angry,
And hurting me,
And then smiling,
And crying,
Apologizing
