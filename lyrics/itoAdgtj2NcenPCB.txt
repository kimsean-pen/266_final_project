There's a hole in the wall next to you
Things with legs are crawling through
The man is searching for the door and you run
You're coming out, you're going down

There's an all night party in room 7609
La-la-la late bar, la la la la la la la la
You can dance together all night, if you've got the time
La-la-la late bar, la la la la la la la la

The bodies move like flies on the wall
You want to run but there's no space at all
The dancers spinning in the mirror ball
You're coming out, you're going 'round

There's an all night party in room 7609
La-la-la late bar, la la la la la la la la
You can dance together all night, if you've got the time
La-la-la late bar, la la la la la la la la

Just come to the late bar
Come, so fast
Drink...
I know what I'm talking about
I know what I'm doing
Ahh...

There's an all night party in room 7609
La-la-la late bar, la la la la la la la la
You can dance together all night, if you've got the time
La-la-la late bar, la la la la la la la la
