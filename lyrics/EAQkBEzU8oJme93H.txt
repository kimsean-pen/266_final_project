Free range of the mind
maps the fire coasting the sidelines
contact with an ease
tarnish point of the supreme
Is it the strength of your fearless over throwing your pain
You'll see new heights you'll be reaching
Is it today that you will find your new release
and in your wake ripple your sweet fate
Free range of the mind
maps the fire coasting the sidelines
contact with an ease
tarnish point of the supreme
Is it the strength of your fearless over throwing your pain
You'll see new heights you'll be reaching
Is it today that you will find a new release
and in your wake ripple your sweet fate
In the death of the grip of the mask that's
covering your simple love for the part of your soul so warm and vast
and I can hear the hinges struggle to last
rusting feel my feathers rush from the past
Building a ladder of love to you and I hope that love you build one too
Building a ladder of love to you and I hope that love you build one too
and then we fly away
and then we fly away
Building a ladder of love to you and I hope that love you build one too
Building a ladder of love to you and I hope that love you build one too
and then we fly away
and then we fly away
and then we fly away
Hand in hand we fly away Hand in hand
