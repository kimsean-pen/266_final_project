Love me like your life depends upon it
Let me know how bad, how bad you want it
Tell me, you can't stay away
Love me with the love that's got no limits
Take it just as good as you can give it
Then give me more than I can take

Don't want just your body
I wanna be the only thing on your mind
When you're not around me, want thoughts about me taking up all your time
I want you in so deep, that you can't keep, can't keep your hands off of me

When I'm gone, say you're back just a little (A little)
Love me in extremes, not the middle
'Till you're so damn gone, you can't go back
Love me, love me, love me, love me like that
Love me like that

Say you'd hate your life without me in it
Say you'd hate it more with every minute
Say you can't live without me
Let me know how much you love to hold me
Then find a million different ways to show me
Show me, that I'm all that you need

Don't want just your body
I wanna be the only thing on your mind
When you're not around me, want thoughts about me taking up all your time
I want you in so deep, that you can't keep, can't keep your hands off of me

When I'm gone, say you're back just a little (A little)
Love me in extremes, not the middle
'Till you're so damn gone, you can't go back
Love me, love me, love me, love me like that
Love me like

You've never loved nothing before
Then love me even more
Wake up with my name on your lips
'Cause you've never had nothing like this (Hey)

When I'm gone, say you're back just a little (A little)
Love me in extremes, not the middle
'Till you're so damn gone, you can't go back
Love me, love me, love me, love me like that
Love me like that
Love me like that
Love me like that
