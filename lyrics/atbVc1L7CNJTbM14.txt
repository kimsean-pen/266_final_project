Weird how life goes
Knocking your dreams away to straw
Mazed but I
I won't shed a tear well knowing your gone
I will draw a smile upon my face and carry on
My way, my days
Is this what life is all about
Healing wounds and carrying on?

I won't mourn your demise
I'll celebrate your life
Shall walk the earth and see
Through your eyes
There will be times you know
When I will feel so low
I'll watch the stars
And you'll be there I know

Melt friends and foes
Letting the dearest people go
Hurt inside
Treachery and lies did wipe my faith
Can't remember last time I felt some love for anyone
Inside
I'm broken
How can one loss destroy you
Crush your will to stand and carry on

I won't mourn your demise
I'll celebrate your life
Shall walk the earth and see
Through your eyes
There will be times you know
When I will feel so low
I'll watch the stars
And you'll be there I know

I won't mourn your demise
I'll celebrate your life
Shall walk the earth and see
Through your eyes
There will be times you know
When I will feel so low
I'll watch the stars
I'll watch the stars
And you'll be there I know

There will be times you know
I won't mourn your demise
I'll celebrate your life
