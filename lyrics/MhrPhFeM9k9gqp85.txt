I just can't be you anymore
I just can't be you anymore
I feel you stand behind me now
Won't shaking hands take me down?
Down, down, down!
So were somewhat unsurprised
Maybe I moved or faking
Everything to me felt just like numb
If you won't see me anymore!
If you won't see me anymore!

And neither could say who is who
And neither could say who is who
You're leaving for another year
Pray that I might cry in on

Through your teeth, through your tears
Still is someone else's life
I won't get you under no yellow sun
I will get you in like a'
Fire now, your bullets gone!
Fire now, your bullets gone!

This one heart is afraid of the dark
Never gonna stop you, never gonna conquer
Fear is running heart, my fear is forever
Darkness is in everything.

This one heart is afraid of the dark
Never gonna stop you, never gonna conquer
Fear is running heart, my fear is forever
Darkness is in everything.

This one heart is afraid of the dark
Never gonna stop you, never gonna conquer
Fear is running heart, my fear is forever
Darkness is in everything.
