I'm not afraid of the microphone
Is it afraid of me?
I'm not afraid of the microphone
Is it afraid of me?
I'm not afraid of the microphone
Is it afraid of me?

Your voice may be con sordino
But we know we can sing
Your voice may be con sordino
But we know we can sing
Your voice may be con sordino
But we know we can sing
Your voice may be con sordino
But we know we can sing

I'm mute
And you could be in tune
I'm mute
And you could be in tune
I'm mute
And you could be in tune
I'm mute
And you could be in tune
I'm mute
And you could be in tune
