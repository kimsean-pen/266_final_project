The only thing that I could ever feel
I can't believe it wasn't real
The only thing that I could ever feel
I can't believe it wasn't real
You can't open your mouth
without telling a lie
but baby, you know how to say goodbye
The thing I spent my whole life
waiting for
has just walked out and locked the door
The thing I spent my whole life
waiting for
has just walked out and locked the door
You can't feel a thing
and you won't even try
but baby, you know how to say goodbye
I'm overjoyed to hear about your wedding
I'm writing you to wish you
every blessing
I'm overjoyed to hear about your wedding
I'm writing you to wish you
every blessing
and I'm so happy I could cry
Oh baby you know how to say goodbye
