Hope everything is alright
Hope everything is alright
What's that floatin' in the water?
Oh, Neptune's only daughter

I believe
In Mr. Grieves
Pray for a man in the middle
One that talks like Doolittle

I believe
In Mr. Grieves
Do you have another opinion?
(Yup!)
Do you have another opinion?

(La la la la, la la la la)
(La la la la, la la la la)
Got bombed, got frozen
Got finally off to finally dozin'

I believe
In Mr. Grieves
Do you have another opinion?
(Yup!)
Opinion
Do you have another opinion?
Do you have another opinion?

You can cry, you can mope
But, can you swing from a good rope?
Oh, I believe
In Mr. Grieves
Hope everything is alright
Hope everything is alright
