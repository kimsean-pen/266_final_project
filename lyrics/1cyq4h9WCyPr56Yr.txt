Waiting here for my phone to ring
Phone to ring
Wondering are you ever coming back to me again
Counting every drop of rain
Drop of rain, falling
Falling down into the holy dark for me
And you bury me
Cause you dug so deep
But I'm still within your reach

Oh, oh
If you really love me
You would let me go
I'm tired of always sleeping with your ghost
Chasing away the things I need the most
If you really love me
You would let me go
If you love me let me go

Every time you come back again, back again
The healing ends
I push all of my rules aside for you
You should see the way authorized, authorized fine for me
To get me everything that you never do
Still it tears at me
Cause you cut so deep
But I'm still within your reach

Oh, oh
If you really love me
You would let me go
I'm tired of always sleeping with your ghost
Chasing away the things I need the most
If you really love me
You would let me go
If you love me let me go

All I need, all I need
Wants to be with you
But you let me bleed, let me bleed
All I need, all I need
Wants to be with you
But you let me bleed, let me bleed

Oh, oh
If you really love me
You would let me go
I'm tired of always sleeping with your ghost
Chasing away the things I need the most
If you really love me
You would let me go
If you love me let me go
If you love me let me go
