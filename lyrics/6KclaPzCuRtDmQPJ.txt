I hate it when you see me cry
Your t-shirt soaked through from my eyes
When I'm not as tough as I should be
You've seen the softest part of me
I hate it when you see me cry
I hate it when you see me cry

I hate it when I let you down
When your smile turns around
And I know I'm supposed to be
The one who says "Babe, count on me"
I hate it when I let you down

I'm...
Your rock 'n roll Joan of Arc
The queen of broken hearts
I'm here to save the world
Who will save Supergirl?
What if I'm weak,
And I need you tonight?
I... hate it
I hate it when you see me cry
(Yeah)

I hate it that I need you now
To hold my hair, to hear me out
If I wake up on the bathroom floor,
Will you still want me in the morn?
Oh, babe, I need you now

I'm...
Your rock 'n roll Joan of Arc
The queen of broken hearts
I'm here to save the world
Who will save Supergirl?
What if I'm weak,
And I need you tonight?
I... hate it
I hate it when you see me cry

(Guitar Solo)

I'm...
Your rock 'n roll Joan of Arc
The queen of broken hearts
I'm here to save the world
Who will save Supergirl?
What if I'm weak,
And I need you tonight?
I... hate it
I hate it when you see me cry!
I hate it when you see me cry!
I hate it when you see me cry...
