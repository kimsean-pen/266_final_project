So show him what you lose
When you answer no, catch the cold
You sail on your own
We share in the toll and we're all alone
Reminds me of her groan
You said, forget the night ahead
She'll never find her on her own
Find her on her own
So tell me if it's wrong then who's to know?
We shared in the toll
We sailed on our own
And she fits the mold
To the one we know
You'll never have some honest fun
You said, lover be fair
Throw your ties to the pair
You'll always have your honest one
On the way to Bordeaux
You'll never have some honest fun
You said, lover be fair
Throw your lies to the fare
You'll always your honest one
I'll always be your honest one
You'll always have some honest fun
So tell me do you lose?
When you answer no, catch the cold
You sailed on your own
We shared in the toll and we're all alone
Find her on her own, goodbye
Find her on her own
You'll never find her on her own
Find her on her own
Find her on her own
She told you to be fair
I only want some honest fun
She said, lover be fair
Throw your eyes to the floor
You're looking at the guilty one
So tell me what you know
And then it will be said and done
She said, be gentle, be fair
Was the fog even there
You're looking at the guilty one
I only want some honest fun
She told you to be fair
I only want some honest fun
She said, lover be fair
Throw your eyes to the floor
You're looking at the guilty one
So tell me what you know
And then it will be said and done
She said, be gentle, be fair
Was the fog even there
You're looking at the guilty one
I only want some honest fun
I'll always be your honest one
