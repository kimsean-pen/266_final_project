Onwards

Driven onwards
Past the point of no return
Into the unknown
Of lessons never learned

Their names - immortal
Remembered evermore
In memory of glory
Forever fallen

Standing proud
Battles raging all around
Fading past
The revelations abound

Anger predominates the mind
Gathering all strength
Tenacity is found

Tenacity is found

Honour now forgotten
Fear lost inside
Despair no longer
At all wasted life

Their names - immortal
Remembered evermore
In memory of glory
Forever fallen

Now forgotten - all thoughts of years gone by
Fallen forever - forever fallen
Life denied
