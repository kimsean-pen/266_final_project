She's my love
She's my holy grail
She's the footprints that I trail
Drop the bread crumbs here I come
Like cats eyes leading me home
I told you it gonna be you
Stone wall I'm running to
Like thunder here I roll
For your lightning like
Give me some of that
Give me some of that that goodness that I see
Give me some of that
Give me some of that that goodness watch me watch me
Even now that you are
I pull the ground to the earth
Even now that you are
If the mountain stands in between
I cut the mountain in two
I cut the mountain in two
I cut the mountain in two
I cut the mountain to get to you watch me
Bring the people gods on their seats
She brings them all to their knees
My boys my remedy
I worship at your feet
I told you I'm coming for you
Stone wall I'm running to
Like thunder here I roll
For your lightning like
Give me some of that
Give me some of that that goodness that I see
Give me some of that
Give me some of that that goodness watch me watch me
Even now that you are
I pull the ground to the earth
Even now that you are
If the mountain stands in between
I cut the mountain in two
I cut the mountain in two
I cut the mountain in two
I cut the mountain to get to you watch me
I cut the mountain to get to you
I cut the mountain to get to you
I cut the mountain to get to you
