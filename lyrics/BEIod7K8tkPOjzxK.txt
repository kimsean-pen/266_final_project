I don't need no one to follow, feathers full
Get up early just to charm unawakened souls
when the sea called me
when the sea called me home

I can't swim. It's lucidity. So clear!
I can't swim. It's lucidity. So clear!

It's no wonder they're shipping all my clothes
Wear the fog, I'll forget the rules I've known
Look in cloud's mirror,
when the sea calls me home

I can't swim. It's lucidity. So clear!

I hear small words from the shore
No recognized pattern
