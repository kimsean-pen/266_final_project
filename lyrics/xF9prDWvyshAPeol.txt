Wish I was pounding out a new beat
I trade my old shoes for new feet
I grab a new seat
I don't like the one I got
Fabric's wearing through
And it's wearing me out
You're wearing me down

Watching old baseball games and low-budget telethons
Ain't like watching you yourself
When you yourself is on
Got time to wander, to waste, and to whine
But when it comes to you it seems like I just can't
Find the time

So watch your head, and then watch the ground
It's a silly time to learn to swim when you start to drown
It's a silly time to learn to swim on the way down

If I gave you my number
Would it still be the same
If I
If I saved you from drowning
Promise me you'll never go away
Oh, promise me you'll always stay

Closed down the last local zoo
I'm gonna win the endless war
Over who kills the last koala bear
And who in death will love him more, and I

He grabs me by the hand
Drags me to the shore and says
Maybe you don't love me
But you'll grow to love me even more, and I
Well, I'm not surprised

If I gave you my number
Would it still be the same
If I
If I saved you from drowning
Promise me you'll never go away
Oh, promise me you'll always stay

Wish I was pounding out a new beat
I trade my old shoes for new feet
I grab a new seat
I don't like the one I got
The fabric's wearing through
And its wearing me out
You're wearing me down, oh, oh
You're wearing me down, oh, oh

So watch your head, baby
And watch the ground
It's a silly time to learn to swim when you start to drown
It's a silly time to learn to swim when you start to drown

If I gave you my number
Would it still be the same
If I
If I saved you from drowning
Promise me you'll never go away

Oh, if I
If I gave you my number
Would it still be the same
If I
If I saved you from drowning
Promise me you'll never go away
Promise me you'll always stay
Promise me you'll always stay
