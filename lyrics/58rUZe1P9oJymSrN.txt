Fade to the darkness all the way
At the start gets, I hoped
That for once I had escaped the fakes, the snakes
Waste of time, so face to face
I'll be bold enough to throw
On an ish I belong to say, to say, to say

The fist is old, but this old
It's dead and ended now
I left all the reasons why
Why you should still be here

Go

Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, like you
I'm not like you

You ain't what I want
And time will never work this out
Oh no, I've got cold
In the heart
Where did we go wrong?

I don't even like you now, forget you
Oh no, I've got cold
In the heart
Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, forget you
I don't like you

All the way
Said not confused we're in the rain
It's a losing hand, fold
Why play on nothing to gain?
All on the rates

The fist is old, but this old
It's dead and ended now
I left all the reasons why
You shouldn't even be here

Go

Oh no, I've got cold
In the heart
Where did we go wrong?

I don't even like you now, forget you
Oh no, I've got cold
In the heart
Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, forget you
I don't like you

All the way
Done with right
I just don't feel this
I'm not all over, it's there

Through the time, that's where the real is
This love has taken its last breath
Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, like you
I'm not like you
You ain't what I want
And time will never work this out

Oh no, I've got cold
In the heart
Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, forget you
Oh no, I've got cold
In the heart
Where did we go wrong?
I don't even like you now, forget you
I don't like you
