Gone
Separate me from this loss I've known
Tolerate these stitches I have sewn
We bare the scars of our lives
A love affair as sharp as a knife
I only cut myself to feel like I'm alive
To feel like I'm alive

Better than the devil that you said it
But you never want to give a credit (Dead it)
Better to the devil you'd forget it
What you didn't know you going to regret it (Regret it)
Better than the devil that you said it
But you never want to give a credit (Dead it)
Better to the devil you'd forget it
What you didn't know you going to regret it (Regret it)

Lost
Desperately we're searching for a cause
Warriors, rebels without applause
We bare the scars of our lives
A love affair as sharp as a knife
I only cut myself to feel like I'm alive
To feel like I'm alive

Better than the devil that you said it
But you never want to give a credit (Dead it)
Better to the devil you'd forget it
What you didn't know you going to regret it (Regret it)
Better than the devil that you said it
But you never want to give a credit (Dead it)
Better to the devil you'd forget it
What you didn't know you going to regret it (Regret it)

Ending in vain
Occupied, suicide all our lives
End in vain
Occupied, suicide all our lives
End in vain
Occupied, suicide all our lives
End in vain

Better than the devil that you said it
But you never want to give a credit (Dead it)
Better to the devil you'd forget it
What you didn't know you going to regret it (Regret it)
Better than the devil that you said it
But you never want to give a credit (Dead it)
Better to the devil you'd forget it
What you didn't know you going to regret it (Regret it)

Now
You're going to regret this
Now
