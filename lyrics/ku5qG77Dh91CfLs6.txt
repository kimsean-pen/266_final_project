My hands are broken
And time is going on and on, it goes
Forever (how long)
So I got high and
Lived all that life that I have taken all
For granted

Promise me you'll try
To leave it all behind
'Cause I've elected hell
Lying to myself
Why have I gone blind?
Live another life
You
You

The only way out
Is letting your guard down and never die
Forgotten (I know)
Forgive me my love
I stand here all alone and I can see
The bottom

Promise me you'll try
To leave it all behind
'Cause I've elected hell
Lying to myself
Why have I gone blind?
Live another life
You
You
You
You
You
You
