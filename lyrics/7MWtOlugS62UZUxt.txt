I'd rather be alone in my bed,
Alone in my head...
Alone by myself because I know I'm a mess.

Everyone is strange!
I'm hiding my name 'cause I'm to afraid of the things I might say!!!

Me oh My!
I must've been high.
Got blood on my suit 'cause I hit that guy, late last night in NYC,
Out tryna find the American Dream!

Oh yeah!!!!!!

Kanye's in my head
Rock'n'Roll is Dead
Just like Mama said I'm not good at making friends
There I go again, should've kept my ass in bed
Just like Mama said I'm not good at making friends

Why was there a dress on my floor?
A hole in my door?
Somebody stole my favorite pair of Tom Ford's
My soul is stained, I'm wicked and shamed
I'm a plane going down in a hurricane

Me oh My!
I must've been high.
Got blood on my suit 'cause I hit that guy, late last night in NYC,
Out tryna find the American Dream!

Oh yeah!!!

Kanye's in my head,
Rock'n'Roll is Dead!
Just like Mama said, I'm not good at making friends!
There I go again, should've kept my ass in bed
Just like Mama said, I'm not good at making friends!

I live my life inside a video
I'll never be the real DiCaprio
I've got a side that no one ...
Knows, knows, knows!

I live my life inside a video
I'm in the back but there's no funeral
I've got a side that no one ...
Knows, knows, knows!

Kanye's in my head
Rock'n'Roll is Dead
Just like Mama said, I'm not good at making friends!
There I go again, should've kept my ass in bed
Just like Mama said, I'm not at making friends!

Kanye's in my head
Rock'n'Roll is Dead
Just like Mama said, I'm not good at making friends!
