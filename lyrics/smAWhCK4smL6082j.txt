The Devil weds a widow
Death another's leftovers
Better to lie on a willows
Rest on alder boughs

Than upon a widow's bed
Used woman's pillow
Sweeter the side of a fence
Than a widow's flank

Sweeter the side of a fence
Than a widow's flank
Sweeter the side of a fence

Softer the side of a groove
Than a widow's beside is
Softer the side of a groove

The Devil weds a widow
The grave one twice wed
A widow's hand is rougher
Than a dry spruce bough

With which she strikes the playful
Grabs the one who laughs
A widow has had her games
And spent a merry evening

Sweeter the side of a fence
Sweeter the side of a fence

Softer the side of a groove
Softer the side of a groove

With which she strikes the playful
Grabs the one who laughs
A widow has had her games
And spent a merry evening
