you gave me more than i ever expected
i can't follow you cause i'm feelin' so lone

your fire burns but i am full of water
i can't realize why you're feeling so lone

ciggarette
at the back of my hand

there are two suns in the sky today
the one is shining all over your head

but my eyes are blind to show you some understanding
can't realize that you're all by your self

ciggarette
at the back of my hand
ciggarette
and you're already dead
