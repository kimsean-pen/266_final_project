Even in the water
You are so soft in the corner
Soft where you shouldn't be
And I just died for it every time

If there was a warning bell
I'd know
But all I hear is music
Soft and low

Never see it coming
I never see it coming on
I never see it coming
I always look the wrong way around

Even when the wind blows
I whisper light as a feather
Same as it ever was
But I was never good at levitating

If there was a warning bell
I'd know
But all I hear is music
Soft and low

I never see it coming
I never see it coming on
I never see it coming
I always look the wrong way around

I have loved to save us
I tend to trust the villain
I've been fine with learning it the hard way

But I will stop and listen
Remind myself a cautious heart
Is a trophy I'm worthy of

I never see it coming

If there was a warning bell
I'd know
But all I hear is music
Soft and low

I never see it coming
I never see it coming on
I never see it coming
I always look the wrong way around
