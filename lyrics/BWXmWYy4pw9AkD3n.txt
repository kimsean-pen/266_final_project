Night, down on the streets, nothing seems real
Shadows playing games on your mind
Victims all around, the fear here is real
Never knowing what you will find

Killer, prowling the night
Killer, can this be right?

Night of the blade
There's no escape
Night of the blade
Run for your life

Run, something is near, the plan is attack
Jack the knife has called out your name
Scream if you can, no one will hear
People say he's going insane

Sinner, prowling the night
Sinner, can this be right?

Night of the blade
There's no escape
Night of the blade
Run for your life

Run, run, run, night of the blade
Run, run, run, night of the blade
Run, run, night of the blade
