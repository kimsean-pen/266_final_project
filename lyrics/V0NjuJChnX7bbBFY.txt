Naked Pictures
On a telephone
All my secrets
That you weren't supposed to know
I sleep just fine
Every single night
'Cause I got a filthy
That you will never find

Everybody wants to know
What I got goin' on below
Everybody wants to see
But they'll never get all of me

Na na na na na na
I get what I want and I'm gonna get mine
Na na na na na na
I get what I want and I'm gonna get mine

I'ma get mine, I'ma get mine
I'ma get, I'ma get mine, I'ma get mine

Uninvited
To my fantasy
So get the fuck out
Of my legacy
I'm pleading guilty
My fate's been sent
And if I had to do it all over
I would do it, do it, do it again

Na na na na na na
I get what I want and I'm gonna get mine
Na na na na na na
Yeah, yeah, I'm doing just fine!

I'ma get mine, I'ma get mine
I'ma get, I'ma get mine, I'ma get mine
I'ma get
I'ma get mine, I'ma get mine
I'ma get, I'ma get mine, I'ma get mine

Everybody wants to know
What I got going on below
Everybody wants to see
But they'll never get all of me

Na na na na na na
I get what I want and I'm gonna get mine
Na na na na na na
I get what I want and I'm gonna get mine
Na na na na na na
I get what I want and I'm gonna get mine
Na na na na na na
I get what I want and I'm gonna get mine
