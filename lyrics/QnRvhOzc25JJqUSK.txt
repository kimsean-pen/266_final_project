I can't undo what I have done.
I can not say what I have said.
Can't take it back, It's a little late... now.
I didn't mean to hurt you... baby...
In any way.

All I wanna do is walk away,
'Cause I don't wanna lie to you.
Something in your eye says "Please, Don't go...".
But I just wanna walk away...
'Cause if I stay I'm gonna end up hurting you...
and I don't wanna break your heart, baby...

It doesn't matter what I'll say,
It doesn't matter what I'll do...
Can't make it right, even though I want to

I'm not gonna say that were okay...
I don't wanna lie.
I should have told you long ago, What was going on...
I should have told you my feelings, were not that strong...

All I wanna do is walk away,
'Cause I don't wanna lie to you.
Something in your eye says "Please, Don't go...".
But I just wanna walk away...
'Cause if I stay I'm gonna end up hurting you...
and I don't wanna break your heart, baby...

I lived through life, it wasn't fair...
I'll say good-bye because I...
Because I care...

I wish I knew what I'm suppose to do...
I wish I could be there for you... to ease the pain.

All I wanna do is walk away,
'Cause I don't wanna lie to you.
Something in your eye says "Please, Don't go...".
But I just wanna walk away.
'Cause if I stay I'm gonna end up hurting you.
and I don't wanna BREAK YOUR HEART, BABY...

I don't wanna break your...
Heart...
