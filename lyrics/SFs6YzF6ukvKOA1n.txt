First of all I am sorry
Disappointment enthusiast
I am permanently sick
I just threw up at the thought of
Being honest
Will the old me ever come back?
My odds unbearably slim
Will you stay for a while and relax?
As I gather my consciousness
You're warm, I'm cold, there's no argument
I shrunk, you grew, I just can't pretend

To be something greater than me
To be someone you want me to be
To be someone you want me to be
To be someone...

You're the copper on the litter
At the bottom
Of the wishing well
It looks as if we both have drowned

Warm hand splash comes
Down on the reach
You'll never mean much to anyone
But you mean the world to me

Out the front door
I watch your body leave
Could you please keep the light on for me
Could you please keep the light on for me
Neighbors shout loudly
"Hey kid, we're so sorry"
Could you please keep the light on for me
Could you please...
Could you please just
Touch my hand one more time
One
Time

So I could feel alive again
One
Time
I blend in
The pastel

You shine so bright
I am lost without the lights

It was a steep slope
Such a rapid change
I thought I had it right
The thought that washed away

It was a steep slope
Such a rapid change
I dreamt of months of snow
You prayed for days of rain

It was a steep slope
Such a swift, swift wave
I thought I had it right
The thought that washed away
