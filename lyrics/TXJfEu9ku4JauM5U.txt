Light's glowing,
Air cold on my face,
A feeling of space,
I'm breathing now.
The silences are so loud,
Cut right to your soul,
Hide yourself in your coat,
You're older now.

Alright, so far, I've been wondering.
Sunlight, colour, couldn't keep it in.
I've said I'm sorry for the last time love,
I never thought that I was whole enough.
I've said I'm sorry for the last time love.

Lost I've,
Found warmth in the cold,
I'm hopeless I know,
But I feel alright.
Calling to the coastline,
Like the ra in I was falling,
Stopped but not stalling,
Older now.
