Say you want to know the truth
Well you can ask me a question
I'll tell you something that you may want to hear
But I'll lie, lie

I don't really wanna be the bitch that gets it shit and bottles it
Deliberately swallows it, one less contestant life
They'll provide the documents to make believe you're gonna fit
Spend your time as militant self help perfection hype

We can make this real
Already tried to go for the gold
Let's go for the stories that remain untold

Aliens have spoke to me and shown me how to see
The parable is terrible but I don't give a sheet
A penis wide that towers high is cumming at your feet
The stories old, the butthole full of cancer spreading meat

Say you want to know the truth
Well you can ask me a question
I'll tell you something that you may want to hear (want to hear)
But I'll lie

And I will never let this go
So open wide
'Cause I know you'll always know
When you lie, lie

I don't really wanna be the bitch that gets it shit and bottles it
Deliberately swallows, it one less contestant life
They'll provide the documents to make believe you're gonna fit
Spend your time as militant self help perfection hype

I can hear a smacking from the corner of the world
A flap then another flap that their bird has shat a pearl
Oil commerce tipped the scale and soaked up all the dung
And flung it back for us to catch and eat out of their bums

I won't stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head blows
I'm in the middle of a midnight mass
And everybody on my dick like preacher, preacher
I won't stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head blows
I'm in the middle of a midnight mass
And everybody on my dick like preacher
Preach to me, tell me what you see
Tell me what I need to do and who to be
'Cause I won't stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head, stop 'til my head blows
I'm in the middle of a midnight mass

So let's start a religion
They'll believe in what we say
Let's start a religion
We can blind their eyes with faith
A new religion
We'll tell them where our spirits go
Start a religion
I need my ego to explode
A new religion (So impressionable)
We can make some widows cry (Attend the festival)
Start a religion (So impressionable)
Can even plan our own demise (Attend the festival)
Let's start a religion (You thought that it mattered? You thought they were flattered?)
We can save some souls tonight (I'm convinced you're an actor, you can take off the wrapper)
Let'start a religion (Yeah I'll whip up the batter but there's nothing you can bake)
Without me their souls will die (If your face ain't light, them crackers act fake tonight)
