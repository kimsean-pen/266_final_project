I keep my head down, won't speak unless I'm spoken to now
I've learned my lesson
They twist and turn your words into a sound you didn't pronounce
Next time you see me
I won't let my hair down
So you can climb up and pull me out
Pull me out, oh
I'm lurking in the shadows, biding my time
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?

To try and take me out
You are the liar, I am the fire
Out, are you gonna take me out?
You are the liar, I am the fire
Out

I put these walls up, questioning the motives of my friends
They can't be trusted, I'm finding I'm the only one I have
Next time you see me, I won't stop to say hello
'Cause I know what you want and I know what I'm in for, yes
I'm lurking in the shadows, biding my time
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?

What you gonna do to take me out?
You are the liar, I am the fire
Out, are you gonna take me out?
You are the liar, I am the fire
Out

I see you whispering, what are they saying?
What are you playing at?
King of the castle, made out of cardboard
I'll be the big bad wolf, I'm gonna take you out

You are the liar, I am the fire
Out, are you gonna take me out?
You are the liar, I am the fire
Out, are you gonna take me out?
You are the liar, I am the fire
Out, are you gonna take me out?
You are the liar, I am the fire
Out, are you gonna take me?
