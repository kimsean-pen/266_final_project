Seventeen years by her side
Broke the same bread
Wore the same clothes and we said
We're sisters with nothing between
If one of us fall
The other will soon be following

Both of you fell the same day
You don't know why
One of you never woke up
And you laid your body down on the floor
You're desperate to hear her footsteps again
But this house is on fire, we need to go

Oh, you don't have to go it alone, go it alone

Run for your life, my love
Run and you don't give up
It's all that you are
All that you want
I will be close behind
Run for your life

She had a fire inside
And that terrified you
You swore that you'd never lose your control
Baby, let yourself go
'cause part of you hides
And I know the hunger inside of you's strong
You can only hold back the river so long

Oh, you don't have to go it alone
Oh, you don't have to go it alone, go it alone

Run for your life, my love
Run and you don't give up
All that you are
All that you want
Run for your life right now
And if you don't know how
I'll come back with you and take all that's true
And leave all that's burned behind
Run for your life

Oh, you don't have to go it alone
Go it alone, go it alone

Run for your life, my love
Run and you don't give up
All that you are
All that you want
Run for your life right now
And if you don't know how
I'll come back with you and take all that's true
Leave all that's burned behind
So run for your life
Run for your life
