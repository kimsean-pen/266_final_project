I clambered over mounds and mounds of polystyrene foam
Then fell into a swimming pool filled with fairy snow

And watched the world turn day-glo, you know, you know
The world turned day-glo, you know, uh oh

I wrenched the nylon curtains back as far as they would go
Then peered through perspex window panes at the acrylic road

And watched the world turn day-glo, you know, you know
The world turned day-glo, you know, uh oh

I drove my polypropylene car on wheels of sponge
Then pulled into a wimpy bar to have a rubber bun

And watched the world turn day-glo, you know, you know
The world turned day-glo, you know, uh oh

The world turned day-glo, you know, you know
The world turned day-glo, you know, uh oh

The X-rays were penetrating through the latex breeze
Synthetic fibre see-thru leaves fell from the rayon trees

The day the world turned day-glo, you know, you know
The world turned day-glo, you know, you know
The world turned day-glo, you know, you know
The world turned day-glo, you know, uh oh
