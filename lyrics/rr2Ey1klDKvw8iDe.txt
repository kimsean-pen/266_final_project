I wish I knew you more, I wished that feeling away
And it always comes back in my head very late
When I rest my head to lay
My thoughts get the best of me

That day the clouds hung over me
That day it seems so distant

Brother, do you watch over me?
Brother, why do you linger inside my mind?

You have no business haunting those you loved
Don't know exactly where you are
In the afterlife?
My brother, I cared so much

Forced to grow on my own
Forced to fill your shoes, and to take on the world
Forced to grow on my own
Forced to fill your shoes, and to take on the world
To take on the world

Now time has left me here to heal
You disappeared, you disappeared
The last thing that I want to do is feel
You had a brother, you had a brother

Now time has left me here to heal
The last thing that I want to do is feel

Brother, do you watch over me?
Brother, why do you linger inside my mind?

Despite what I've said, I'm not bitter
Only regretful of the time we didn't spend
The laughs we didn't share
The brother you could have been
