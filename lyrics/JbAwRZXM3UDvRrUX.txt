They say that love is a game
Only played by the dumbest of fools
That the feeling's elusive
And what can you do with a ruse?

"Oh. Oh. Ooh, ooh, ohh"

They say that wanting a heart
Is nothing like what people believe
And to give it away
Is something you don't want to need

"Oh. Oh. Ooh, ooh, ohh"

Listen to me
I don't wanna be alone
I'm gonna find someone
I swear the fire will never grow cold

I get scared sometimes
When I see all the connections happening around me
That fate will evade me
That time will betray me
That future I just don't want to see

"Oh. Ooh, ooh, ohh"

Listen to me
I don't wanna be alone

I'm gonna find someone
I swear the fire will never grow cold
Listen to me
I'm not gonna be alone

I'm gonna find someone
I swear the fire will never grow cold
I don't wanna be
I'm not gonna be
I don't wanna be
I'm not gonna be
Lonely anymore
Not gonna be lonely anymore
Don't wanna be lonely anymore
