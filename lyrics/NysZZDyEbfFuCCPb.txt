My love, my love, you say,
There is still pain left
Still glass that is not broken

There are still blows you kept from taking
Still trying to have my mist
There are still wars you cannot apply for
Still accusations you've not payed
Some parts, still alive

You kiss your nightmares
Everywhere, everywhere, yeah
You feel your nightmares
Everywhere, everywhere, yeah
You touch your nightmares
Everywhere, everywhere, yeah

Why, why can't you see,
You should be kissin' me

My man, my man, you say,
There is still pain left
Still more we could panictize
There are still some molecules impacted
And there's still a darker plan

You kiss your nightmares
Everywhere, everywhere, yeah
You feel your nightmares
Everywhere, everywhere, yeah
You touch your nightmares
Everywhere, everywhere, yeah

But why, why can't you see

Bet it all on me

You kiss your nightmares
Everywhere, everywhere, yeah
You feel your nightmares
Everywhere, everywhere, yeah
You touch your nightmares
Everywhere, everywhere, yeah

Why, why can't you see,
You should be kissin' me
