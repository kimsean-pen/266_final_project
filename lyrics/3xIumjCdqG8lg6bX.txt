I saw you looking over
Now I see you moving this way
Pushing through the crowd
Like you got something to say, yeah

But you couldn't walk, 'cause, the music's taken over your feet
I could tell by your toes that you're rocking to this beat

Gotta dance 'til you ache, 'til you drop, 'til you break
Free your soul let me see you shake
One by one we're stealing the stage
Here we come, so get out of our way

It won't be long 'til the summer is gone
Get your party on
So we'll sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on
So we'll scream it out loud (yow)

I know your type and all the hype is going straight to your head
And everybody's stopping what their doing
'Cause, your face is turning red, yeah

Gotta learn how to move to the grove
Give in, or get out (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Put your hands in the air
Stand up in your chair and shout

You're all dolled up with nowhere to go
You wanna get out and put on a show
There's nothing wrong with staying home
As long as you've got your radio

It won't be long 'til the summer is gone
Get your party on
So we'll sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on
So we'll scream it

Don't wait and don't you be late
Get your party on
So we'll sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on
So we'll scream it out loud

Come on
Dallas, Texas (yeah)
Bring it home for me, baby

The little things that you do
From across the room
I see you're sending me clues
There in the way you make me move, move

It won't be long 'til the summer is gone
Get your party on
So we'll sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on
So we'll scream it

Don't wait and don't you be late
Get your party on
So we'll sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on
And scream it out loud

(Get your party on)
(Get your, get your party on)
Scream it out loud
(Get your party on)
Get your, get your party on

Let's do it again
