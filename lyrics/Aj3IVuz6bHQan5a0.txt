I met her in a club down in old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like cherry cola
C 0 L A cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola
L O L A Lola
La la la la Lola

Well I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
Oh my Lola
La la la la Lola
Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walks like a woman and talks like a man
Oh my Lola
La la la la Lola
La la la la Lola

Well we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candle light
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
And said dear boy won't you come home with me?

Well I'm not the worlds most passionate guy but
When I looked in her eyes what I almost felt for my Lola
La la la la Lola
La la la la Lola
Lola
La la la la Lola
La la la la Lola

I pushed her away
I walked to the door I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees
And I looked at her and she at me

That's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
La la la la Lola

Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up muddle
In a shaken up world
Except for Lola
La la la la Lola

Well I left her just a week before
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
Lola smiled and took me by the hand and said dear boy I'm gonna make you a men

Well I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man so is Lola
La la la la Lola
La la la la Lola
La la la la Lola
La la la la Lola
La la la la Lola
La la la la Lola
La la la la Lola
La la la la Lola
La la la la Lola
La la la la Lola
