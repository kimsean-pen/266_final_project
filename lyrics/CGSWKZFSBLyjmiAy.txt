It's been a hard year
And I'm not over it
Trying to stop the fear of changing

But if we make it through the summer
We'll make it through the day
If we make it through the summer
But anything we made

Trying not to think about
Trying not think at all
Trying not to fight the fit
Trying not to hear the call

I could be in another place gone far

And if we make it through the summer
We'll make it through the day
If we make it through the summer
But anything we made

If we make it through the summer
We'll make it through the day
If we make it through the summer
But anything we made
