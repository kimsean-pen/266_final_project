Slow down, you are out of control
One of us is right, and one of us is wrong
And, I know that you're not coming home
There's nowhere to park, after it gets dark, yeah
Can't tell what I want when you sing
So keep it to yourself, I haven't missed anything

You are my voice, my microphone
You are my voice, so take me on
You are my voice

Slow down, you are out of control
It could be so easy if it didn't feel so wrong
And, warmed up and your hair is too long
What if I was young? What if I was younger?
And so, finally she showed
I never should have asked, it was a long time ago

You are my voice, my microphone
You are my voice, so take me on
You are my voice
You are my voice

You are my voice, my microphone
You are my voice my microphone
You are my voice, so take me on
You are my voice, my microphone

You are my voice
You are my voice
You are my voice

One of us is right, and one of us is wrong
One of us is right, and one of us is wrong
