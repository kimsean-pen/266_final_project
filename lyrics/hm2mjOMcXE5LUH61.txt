NIL!

(Yeah!)
Chaos, is just the beginning
Every promise I made I'm resending
Center mass in the middle of the monster

I'm getting tired of drowning the constant
Crying for help
It's debatable
The only reason that you love me is

I'm hated by all
Come on!

Come see dysfunction
I guess we're gunna leave it

Open for discussion
Who am I?
Where am I going?
Maybe I'm looking in the wrong direction
Maybe I'm looking for any direction
This is not my war
This is not my fight
This is something more

This is not my life
This is not my revolution
This is not my convolution
This is not my expectation
This is not my desperation

(Yeah!)
Hold up, scarred and tamed for the hell of it
Look at me, I am the glorified malcontent
Save me, save this

All I got to do is give up
And all is forgiven
I'm sic!
Of being the butt of a cosmic joke
And I don't get the punchline
A million people lined up for miles
To see the great big mouth

Shut up and apologize!
This is not my war
This is not my fight
This is something more
This is not my life
This is not my revolution
This is not my convolution
This is not my only reason to question why
Today I said goodbye!
Goodbye!
Oh I didn't need to leave
To stay right here
Today I said goodbye!

Goodbye!

Oh I didn't need to leave
To stay right here
Today I said goodbye!
Goodbye!

Oh I didn't need to leave
To stay right here
Today I said goodbye!
Goodbye!

Oh I didn't need to leave
To stay right here
Today I said goodbye!
(Yeah!)
I'm the pariah (Break Me)

I am the liar (Save Me)
I can take anything (Make Me)
Accuse me of everything (Kill Me)
Cut off the system (Enlave Me)
Deny my existance (Erase Me)
I won't be afraid (Try Me)
I won't be unmade (Take Me!)
Come on!
Break it all
Come on!
Buy the lie
Come on!

Say it
Say it!
Come on!
Say goodbye!
Goodbye!

Oh I didn't need to leave
To stay right here
Today I said goodbye!
Goodbye!
Oh I didn't need to leave
To stay right here
Today I said goodbye!
Goodbye!
Oh I didn't need to leave
To stay right here
Today I said goodbye!
Goodbye!
Oh I didn't need to leave
To stay right here
Today I said goodbye!
