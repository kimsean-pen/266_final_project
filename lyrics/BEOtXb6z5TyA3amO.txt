Let the whole town say that you're bad
Everyone you've known should be glad
Just to know for a moment they had
The pleasure of you
When you were young
You joined the boys in all of their games
Now you've come of age and still they sometimes whispher your name
Please try to forget because your past is over and done
And your future with me has just begun
Let the whole town say that you're bad
Everyone you've known should be glad
Just to know for a moment they had
The pleasure of you
Though you were a child nature had blessed you ahead of your time
And it's no surprise you had the young men waiting in line
Now they only talk because they'll never touch you again
And they couldn't love you like I can
Let the whole town say that you're bad
Everyone you've known should be glad
Just to know for a moment they had
The pleasure of you
