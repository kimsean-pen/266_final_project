I can't believe I didn't say this sooner
I'll just believe that I was all displaced
I'll get to speakin' let you know how I feel
I'll get to judgin' make you see my appeal

No one will ever see things the way I do
No one will try
All my friends think that I'm gone
But I swear, I swear I'm not
I swear I'm not

This makes me feel that I'll never be quite normal
This makes me act like I'll never get out alive
I'll get to actin' make you all believe me
I'll get to fakin' show you all how to grieve

No one will ever see things the way I do
No one will try
All my friends think that I'm gone
But I swear, I swear I'm not
I swear I'm not

In and out is where it gets back to the place
It does make me feel like I just wanna be
Just like its touch...

No one will ever see things the way I do
No one will try
(All your friends think that you're gone
But you swear...)
I swear I'm not

No one will ever see things the way I do
No one will try
All my, friends think that I'm gone
But I swear, I swear I'm not
I swear I'm not.
