Woke up today, with the sun on my face.
I tried to pray, but I hated the taste.
Speed off to work like a rat in a race.
Cut up a smile, but it's not on my face!

Tick, Tick, Tick, Tick, Boom!

I'm a time bomb, Just set me off!
My sanity is failing me. 5-4-3-2- Boom!
I'm a time bomb, Ready to bleed! Humanity is failing me. 5-4-3-2-1

I lace my teeth with gold.they're rotting from the inside!

Bury me seven feet deep! Closer to my misery.
No air to breathe! No room to think!
Why don't you?, Bury me seven feet deep!

I think I'm okay. I think I'm okay.
I think I'm okay. I think I'm okay.
But don't you fucking touch me!
I think I'm okay? I think I'm okay? I won't be okay!

Tick, Tick, Tick, Tick, Boom!
I'm a time bomb, Just set me off!
My sanity is failing me. 5-4-3-2- Boom!
I'm a time bomb, Ready to bleed! Humanity is failing me. 5-4-3-2-1

I'm not a martyr! I'm just a fiend.
So take a step back. Take a step back!
Can you see me smiling while I'm hiding in your back seat?
Bury me seven feet deep! Closer to my misery.
No air to breathe! No room to think!
Why don't you?, Bury me seven feet deep!

Maybe my day will come.
Running waters never brought me to where I belong.
And now I'm blind,
God I'm so blind!
My suicide was labeled,
as a common dose of cyanide.

Tick Tick Boom!

I'm a time bomb, Just set me off!
My sanity is failing me. 5-4-3-2- Boom!
I'm a time bomb, Ready to bleed! Humanity is failing me. 5-4-3-2-1

Bury me seven feet deep!
