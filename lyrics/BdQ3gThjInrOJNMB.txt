Tear apart the life and times of familiar faces
And tracing lines to what connects me and binds me to
Images of the remote and never-changing
Grand designs, style and grace
And am I

Lost in thoughts on open seas
Let the currents carry me
If I could would I remain
Another life or another dream

No turning back, face the fact
I am lost in space and time
Turning here, looking back in time

One and all let us celebrate the rise and fall
Celebrate the life and times of splendor
Desire and love constant and never-changing
The flow of times, closed in lines
Can't tell if I'm just

Lost in thoughts on open seas
Let the currents carry me
If I could would I remain
Another life or another dream

No turning back, face the fact
I am lost in space and time
Turning here, looking back in time
