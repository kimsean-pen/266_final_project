I'm on the doorstep
With my key turned in the door
Walk in the living room
And you're sat on the floor

My heart is aching
And I've never felt this bad
I pinch myself
To check that all of this is real

Keep faking
I'm not letting on, I feel this sad
And then you've got the cheek
To ask me how I feel

And I say absolutely nothing
I'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing
You can say to change my mind

Absolutely nothing
I'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing
You can say to change my mind

I know that you just want
To see me get upset
My world turned upside down
So what did you expect?

My heart is aching
And I've never felt this bad
I pinch myself
To check that all of this is real

Keep faking
I'm not letting on, I feel this sad
And then you've got the cheek
To ask me how I feel

And I say absolutely nothing
I'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing
You can say to change my mind

Absolutely nothing
I'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing
You can say to change my mind

You've seen me cry
Too many times
But not this time
No, not this time

I don't need you
To help me through
I'll be just fine
I'll be just fine

And I say absolutely nothing
I'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing
You can say to change my mind

Absolutely nothing
I'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing
You can say to change my mind

Absolutely nothing
I'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing
You can say to change my mind

Absolutely nothing
I'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing
You can say to change my mind

Absolutely nothing
I'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing
You can say to change my mind

Absolutely nothing
I'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing
You can say to change my mind
