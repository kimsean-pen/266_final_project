Run away nowhere,
To chicken shit, two face.
I'm gonna go there,
The fear I cannot taste.
You think you got me?
You're gonna tumble down.
Keep coming for me,
I'll drop you on the ground.
I fuck with no one,
Until you get into my face.

Break you down, mercy, I cannot allow!
Through your face, my fist will plow!

Watching as your blood pours down!
Let's do this now!
Break you down, mercy, I cannot allow!
Through your face, my fist will plow!
Watching as your blood pours down!

Let's do this now!

You're gonna feel how,
I really am with you.
You're going nowhere,

Don't really know what to do.
It's going to go on,
Until you run away.
You can't control me,
You best do it my way.
I fuck with no one,
Until you get into my face.

Break you down, mercy, I cannot allow!
Through your face, my fist will plow!
Watching as your blood pours down!
Let's do this now!
Break you down, mercy, I cannot allow!
Through your face, my fist will plow!
Watching as your blood pours down!
Let's do this now!

Don't you know that you can punch me?
Don't you know that you can bring me down?
Oh my life would be so easy now,
If you hadn't stepped across that line!
Line!

Break you down, mercy, I cannot allow!
Through your face, my fist will plow!
Watching as your blood pours down!
Let's do this now!

Break you down, mercy, I cannot allow!
Through your face, my fist will plow!
Watching as your blood pours down!
Let's do this now!

Break you down, mercy, I cannot allow!
Through your face, my fist will plow!
Watching as your blood pours down!
Let's do this now!
Break you down, mercy, I cannot allow!
Through your face, my fist will plow!
Watching as your blood pours down!
Let's do this now!
