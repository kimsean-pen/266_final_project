You should have gone to the doctor, you have too many things to offer
You could have listened to yourself talk as if you're someone else
Laugh track inside your head
Laugh track inside your head
Laugh track inside your head
Running out of jokes for the audience
Running out of jokes
You have no one to drive you home, you can't stand it to be alone
There's only voices inside your head to keep you company while in bed
Laugh track inside of your head
Laugh track inside of your head
Laugh track
It's no wonder that you're not laughing with them but you scoff
At the notion of a life without interaction, there's no doubt
Laugh track behind your back
Laugh track behind your back
Running out of jokes for the audience
Running out of jokes
Running out of jokes for the audience
Running out of jokes
