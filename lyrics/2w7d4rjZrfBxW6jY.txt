You are soaked in bleach and faint of heart
In this world, some things you'll have to just let go
Do you believe me? I don't believe in anything
Do you believe me? I don't believe in anything

(Chorus):
Do what your brain says
Take what you like
Soon it's over, you'll regret your whole life
It's not easy as I thought it would be
That's on me

Split my teeth and tongue
Chew on my gums
To hunt is to carry
Lay my head to rest
Under a grave
The sun is a cherry
The sun is a cherry
What's yours is mine, we're married

Uuuhhhhh

(Chorus)

Stumble down the hall
And split my teeth and tongue against the wall
There's no right or wrong
Crawl through shade to get beyond the sun

Split my teeth and tongue
Split my teeth and tongue
Split my teeth and tongue

(Chorus) x2
