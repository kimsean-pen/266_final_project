I'm better off saying nothing
But I get so caught up in it, so caught up in you
So here's to the first time I've arrived
With nothing left to lose

You should see what I've become:
So obsessively lost in the way I love
It isn't like me though (oh, no)
To just lose control

Maybe I'll stay this time
Whether you had asked me to, I'm back into it
Ready your hand in mine
I could only get so far without your guide

(Whether you had asked me to, I'm back into it.)
Ready your hand in mine
I could only get so far without you by my side

So here you are again
Too late to fix what progress I've made
But I've built this confidence charade
All just so you could be amazed

And I know inside it hurts you
To see me so down on myself
But it's the thought that you deserve so much more
Than I could ever help

Maybe I'll stay this time
Whether you had asked me to, I'm back into it
Ready your hand in mine
I could only get so far without your guide

(Whether you had asked me to, I'm back into it.)
Ready your hand in mine
I could only get so far without you by my side

It's in my head, I'm waking up again
(I'd lost my way but now I'm home.)
Still standing under your doorframe
With a plan to leave alone

Pretending I'm still with you
Time and time again
Why don't you show me a real life
With your hand in mine?

Maybe I'll stay this time
Whether you had asked me to, I'm back into it
Ready your hand in mine
I could only get so far without you by my side

Maybe I'll stay this time
Whether you had asked me to, I'm back into it
Ready your hand in mine
I could only get so far without your guide

(Whether you had asked me to, I'm back into it.)
Ready your hand in mine
I could only get so far without you by my side
