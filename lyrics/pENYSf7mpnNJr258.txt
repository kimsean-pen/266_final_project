Memory, thunder cloud
Sadi Sati killing down

Starved at the root again
We don't taste the air
Mother tongue

Om Shrim Maha
Lakshmiyei Swaha Om

Vibrate (inner) universe
Primale state (counsels)
To the unknown guest

Penniless, in reverse
A pathless land
Where we touch Earth

Dark at the bloom again
We don't see the dawn
Mother tongue

Om Shrim Maha
Lakshmiyei Swaha Om

Vibrate (inner) universe
Primal state (counsels)
To the unknown guest
Pulsate

Starved at the root again
We don't taste the air
Dark at the bloom again
WE hold our despair

Mama Tongue

Om Shrim Maha
Lakshmiyei Swaha Om

Vibrate (inner) universe
Timeless state (counsels)
To the unknown guest
Pulsate (silent) universe
Mantras grace
Om
