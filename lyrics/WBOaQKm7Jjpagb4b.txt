I'm numb
I can't feel my arms
I can't feel my legs
I can't feel my body
I can't feel my head
I can't come around
Don't know what to feel
I'm nailed to the ground
I'm too wounded to heal
I can't feel my arms
I can't feel my legs
I can't feel my body
I can't feel my head
I can't come around
Don't know what to feel
I'm nailed to the ground
I'm too wounded to heal
I've got blood on my hands
A hole in my heart
I'm afraid of my thoughts and
I'm falling apart
I'm surrounded by fear
Stuck in despair
And if I make it from here I'll be good, I swear
I'm dreaming away
I'm making excuses
Somebody said I'm totally useless
Give me a reason, give me a sign
Something to stop me from loosing my mind
I'm blind
I can't see a thing
I can't hear a word
I can't even bring myself to be heard
I wanna get out
I'm locked up for good
If I speak, if I shout
I'll be misunderstood
I can't feel my arms
I can't feel my legs
I can't feel my body
I can't feel my head
I can't come around
Don't know what to feel
I'm nailed to the ground
I'm too wounded to heal
I've got blood on my hands
A hole in my heart
I'm afraid of my thoughts and
I'm falling apart
I'm surrounded by fear
I'm Stuck in despair
And if I make it from here I'll be good, I swear
I'm dreaming away
I'm making excuses
Somebody said I'm totally useless
Give me a reason, give me a sign
Something to stop me from loosing my mind
I've got blood on my hands
A hole in my heart
I'm afraid of my thoughts and
I'm falling apart
I'm surrounded by fear
I'm Stuck in despair
And if I make it from here I'll be good, I swear
I'm dreaming away
I'm making excuses
Somebody said I'm totally useless
Give me a reason, give me a sign
Something to stop me from loosing my mind
