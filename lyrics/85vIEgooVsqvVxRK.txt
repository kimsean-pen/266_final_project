I live on the beach
Waters surrounding me
And its got too deep
I let it get to the deep
My home has no shade
Nothing to sustain me
But it keeps me safe
From my dream pain
In the dim light of the truth
All you can do is bow
The walls have inches
Im new in this place, me
But I know Ill stay
Cant ever get away
To the fluctuation
I have on my womb
And I look on morning
With all of the beach
Theres an ocean
Making life beyond believe
And you vast insist to match
For me this day
And in the light of the truth
All I can do is bow
