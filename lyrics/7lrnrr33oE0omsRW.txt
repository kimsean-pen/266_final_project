She's got a lip ring and five colours in her hair
Not into fashion but I love the clothes she wears
Her tattoo's always hidden by her underwear
She don't care

Everybody wants to know her name
I threw a house party and she came
Everyone asked me, who the hell is she?
That weirdo with five colours in her hair

She's just a loner with a sexy attitude
And I'd like to phone her 'cause she puts me in the mood
The rumour's spreading now that she cooks in the nude
But she don't care, she don't care

Everybody wants to know her name
How does she cope with her new found fame?
Everyone asked me, who the hell is she?
That weirdo with five colours in her hair

She was all I thought about, the girl I couldn't live without
But then she went insane, she couldn't take the fame
She said, I was to blame, she'd had enough
And shaved five colours off
And now she's just a weirdo with no name

Everybody wants to know her name
How does she cope with her new found fame?
Everyone asked me, who the hell is she
That weirdo with five colours in her hair
(One, two, three, four)
