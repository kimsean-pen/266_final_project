As logic stands
You couldn't meet a man
Who's from the future
But logic broke
As he appeared, he spoke
About the future

"We're not gonna make it"
He explained how the end will come
You and me were never meant to be
Part of the future

All we have is now
All we've ever had is now
All we have is now
All we've ever had is now

I noticed that
He had a watch and hat
That looked familiar
He was me
From a dimension torn free
Of the future

"We're not gonna make it"
He explained how the end will come
You and me were never meant to be
Part of the future

All we have is now
All we've ever had is now
All we have is now
All we've ever had is now

All we have is now
