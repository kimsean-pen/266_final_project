I never knew someone was out there
A long way from nowhere
Who could open my eyes

All this time while I'm sleeping
The world changed around me
Now I've never felt more alive

I'm waking up
From a life left behind
To see what lies ahead
I'm waking up

Fate found the way
To bring them together
Once and forever

And won't let them go
Nothing I say
Can keep her from leaving
Her life has a meaning

I lost her a long time ago
I'm waking up
From a life left behind
To see what lies ahead

I'm waking up
I'm waking up
Now that yesterday's gone
Won't close my eyes again
I'm waking up
I plan to return well-disguised
Make sure that I'm not recognized

Tomorrow a new sun will rise
And somehow I'll find you

Nothing will stand in my way
Soon I will see you again
I'm waking up
From a life left behind

To see what lies ahead
I'm waking up
I'm waking up
(I'm waking up)
Now that yesterday's gone
(Now that yesterday's gone)
I won't close my eyes

(I will never look back)
I'm waking up
you'll be her shadow as she moves, my son
But she can never know of it
She is alone and rebels are everywhere
I'll keep her safe from all danger
Won't let her out of my sight
Did I fail to mention my honest intentions?
This is the chance I deserve
Heed my words
Justice will be served.
