What does she do?
To leave me motionless
Blinding me
How can I enclose myself in a bottle?

I cried the truth
To find out how to keep my faith
I cried the truth
To find out how to keep my faith

What does she do?
To leave me passionless
Blinding me
Her bones turn into a fetish
Suddenly ready for me to tear apart

I apologize for everything you hold
Every arm I take
I've realized that every shallow moment quickly disappears
I won't hide
And hope that all has changed I'll stay home today

I cried the truth
To find out how to keep my faith
I cried the truth
To find out how to keep my faith
To find out how to keep my faith
