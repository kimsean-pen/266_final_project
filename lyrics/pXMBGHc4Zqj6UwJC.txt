At the end of the day, everything is a blur
I'm gonna lick my wounds and eat my words
Better tell Revelations, the time is now
I use my dirty hands to dig the Devil out

All my life is, all these vices
Every day's another crisis
All my life is, all these vices
Everyday (everyday) everyday (everyday) everyday!

I'm gonna live my life (my life)
Like it's Saturday night (Saturday night)
I'm gonna live my life (my life)
And sleep when I am dead and buried
I'm gonna live my life (my life)
Like it's Saturday night (Saturday night)
I'm gonna live my life (my life)
Sunday I will say I'm sorry

At the end of the road, at the end of the road
Will I open one night and bring it all home?

All my life is, all these vices
Every day's another crisis
All my life is, all these vices
Everyday (everyday) everyday (everyday) everyday!

I'm gonna live my life (my life)
Like it's Saturday night (Saturday night)
I'm gonna live my life (my life)
And sleep when I am dead and buried
I'm gonna live my life (my life)
Like it's Saturday night (Saturday night)
I'm gonna live my life (my life)
Sunday I will say

All my life is, all these vices
Everyday (everyday) everyday (everyday) everyday!

I'm gonna live my life (my life)
Like it's Saturday night (Saturday night)
I'm gonna live my life (my life)
And sleep when I am dead and buried
I'm gonna live my life (my life)
Like it's Saturday night (Saturday night)
I'm gonna live my life (my life)
Sunday I will say I'm sorry
