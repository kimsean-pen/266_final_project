You look at me, you see her face
No, you don't like me
I'm just there to hold her place
I fall asleep, head on your chest
But I wake up on the other side of the bed

Hope I distract you enough from the girl that you love
'Cause I've been doing the same
You're just a boy that I 'ah'
I hope that wasn't too much
But, boy, I don't give a fuck
That's what I'm telling myself
So that I don't get caught up on you
Caught up on you

I hope I keep her side of the bed warm
If that's the only thing that you've been keeping me around for
We won't say how we're feeling 'cause we're unsure
But we love playing this game of who can care less more
Who can care less, who care less more
It's a contest
Who do we care less for
Who can care less, who can care less more
It's a contest of who can care less more

You stole the sheets
I stole them back
Boy, that was cold, but I can be colder then that
That's why I leave
Keep all my make-up
So that I'm gone before the morning when you wake up

Hope I distract you enough from the girl that you love
'Cause I've been doing the same
You're just a boy that I 'ah'
'Cause baby, I'm just too much for you to do more then fuck
That's what you're telling yourself
So you don't get caught up on me
Caught up on me

I hope I keep her side of the bed warm
If that's the only thing you've been keeping me around for
Won't say how we're feeling 'cause we're unsure
But we love playing this game of who can care less more
Who can care less, who can care less more
It's a contest
Who do we care less for
Who can care less, who can care less more
It's a contest of who can care less more

Why you wasting all of your time laying next to me?
If you really wanted it so bad it's where you'd be
Why you wasting all of your time busy texting me?
If you don't want what's best for me

(Caught up on me)
