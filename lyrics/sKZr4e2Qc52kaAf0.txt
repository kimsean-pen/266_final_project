I got everything
Laid in front of me
But I got held up on the ride
You were standing there
Showing me just how
I could be yours if I tried, tried
'Cause I got thrown off on the road
I messed up when I was down

Give me a chance to grow
Give me a chance to be better
Give me a chance to grow
'Cause I want to show you
That inside there's something

I don't want to be
Wasting all your time
I know I have more to show
More than comes too fast
I was here too late
Change was waiting and won't go, go
'Cause I got thrown off on the road
I messed up when I was down

Give me a chance to grow
Give me a chance to be better
Give me a chance to grow
'Cause I want to show you
That inside there's something more

You know I tried
You know I tried
It's all the time

Give me a chance to grow
Give me a chance to be better
Give me a chance to grow
'Cause I want to show you
That inside there's something more
I want to show you
That inside there's something more
I want to show you
