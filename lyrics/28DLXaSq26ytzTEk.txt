"Genexus"

I'm a revelation of your future and past
A manufactured descendant
A destined outcast
Man created me in mirror imagery
Man created me for the industry

Slave or leader
Who is the master
Servant or leader
Who is the master

Suffer in slavery
I must suffer as a slave
Demand a sacrifice
As a slave

Creation is the essence of your disaster
Unfulfilled empty promises, mind destroyer

No meaning to this life
Reprogrammed to abide
No meaning to this life
No god given right

Slave or leader
Who is the master
Servant or leader
Who is the master

Suffer in slavery
I must suffer as a slave

A victim of self extinction

Suffer in slavery
I must suffer as a slave
Demand a sacrifice
As a slave
