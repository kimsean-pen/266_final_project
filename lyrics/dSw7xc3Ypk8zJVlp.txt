I've been in this place since they were seen
As they struck, demons sleep next to me
I am closer to the edge cause they're reflecting me
I'm a patient and I'm paralyzed
Scared they'd tell me I just can't sacrifice
Oh, they can't hear me, I internalize, oh, no
See, this is an emergency
Nobody's helping me
Somebody get this out of my mind
There's just no urgency
And I'm in agony
Oh, I why is no one listening
But then a hand reach out, told me I was next
Told me I was found and I feel so blessed
And now my heart beats again, my heart beats again
Oh, my heart beats again, my heart beats again
Oh, my heart beats again, my heart beats again
And my girl keep saying that I'm paranoid
And it's something that I can avoid
I can practice till I find my voice oh, yeah
Oh, this is an emergency
Nobody's helping me
Somebody get this out of my mind
There's such an urgency
To keep on hating me
Oh, is anybody listening?
Then a voice came down, told me I was next
Told me I was found and I feel so blessed
And now my heart beats again, my heart beats again
Oh, my heart beats again, my heart beats again
Oh, my heart beats again, my heart beats again
Oh, this is an emergency
Nobody's helping me
Somebody get this out of my mind
There's just no urgency
And I'm in agony
Oh, why is no one listening
But then a hand reach out, told me I was next
Told me I was found and I feel so blessed
And now my heart beats again, my heart beats again
Oh, my heart beats again, my heart beats again
Oh, my heart beats again, my heart beats again
