You're a good soldier
Choosing your battles
Pick yourself up
Dust yourself off
And get back in the saddle

You're on the front line
Everyone's watching
You know it's serious
We are getting closer
This isn't over

The pressure is on
You feel it
But you got it all,
Believe it

When you fall
Get up oh, oh
If you fall
Get up eh, eh

Tsamina mina

Waka waka eh eh
Tsamina mina Zangalewa

Listen to your God
This is our motto
Your time to shine
Don't wait in line
Y vamos por todo

People are raising
Their expectations
Go on and feed them
This is your moment
No hesitations

Today's your day,
I feel it
You paved the way,
Believe it

If you get down
Get up oh, oh
When you get down
Get up eh, eh
