Maria's stoned like a porcelain saint
sweet morphine
sweet morphine

Curls a smile when the sadness hits
finds my face with fingertips

Have you seen her
the daughter of the hum of the highway
she's curling up like smoke

Oh city lights fly at this speed
oh heaven knows
it ain't me behind the wheel
this time

Through the hills, you can hear them sing
ah Maria, ah Maria
