What are you afraid of?
I know that you are
Keep it in your sights now
And don't let it go far
What are you afraid of?
Making it better
Keep it by your side now
Whatever the weather
Keep it together
Keep it together
What did you do?
Wonder where your heart came from
What have you done?
My only friend, keep on
Wander or leave
Turn into winter lights
Keeping your strength
When it gets dark at night

What are you made of?
Water and glass
Keep it in your sights now
It's keeping you up
Keep it together
Keep it together
What did you do?
Wonder where your heart came from
What have you done?
My only friend, keep on
Wander or leave
Turn into winter lights
Keeping your strength
When it gets dark at night
Keep...
Oh...
Keep a straight line
I'm running
Running
A straight line
What did you do?
Wonder where your heart came from
What have you done?
My only friend, keep on
Wander or leave
Turn into winter lights
Keeping your strength
When it gets dark at night
What you're feeling
Is what I'm feeling too
What we're made of
Is what I'm made of too

What are you afraid of?
I know that you are
What are you afraid of?
I know that you are
