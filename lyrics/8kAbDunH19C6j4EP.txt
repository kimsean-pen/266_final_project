I was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, alone and unceremoniously
...Buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, when life was taken from me

Our tree was full and green, I had to leave it
The sadness was overwhelming,
To be alone beneath it

The sun came down hot and hard, I could never sleep
To disappear was the only way I could find relief

When I was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, alone and un-Sarah-moniously
...Buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, when life was taken so suddenly

First I paid my respects to Glenn Gould
Then I visited the grave of Alexander Muir
Next to Eaton's tomb, I hung my head and cried
Looking for Joseph Mulgrew, I gave up and died

When I was buried...

The birds sang, the flowers in bloom, spring had just begun
Recently fitted for a suit, now lying in a box
By summer, I was gone, my remains stolen from the ground
My body never recovered and I was never found
...Until now

I was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, alone and unceremoniously

Buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, between the monuments and trees
At the heart of the city, Amongst the statues and fountains
New life could begin, where the old path I ran came to and end

[David Gold Version 1.9, June 19th 1980 - May 11th, 2007 Aged 26]

I was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, alone and unceremoniously
