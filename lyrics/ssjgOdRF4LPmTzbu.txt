On my own, she's at home
There's not a single day
That I was gonna miss you all
Time and space, our love delays
Know that when I go
There's no reason to be afraid

How come we were in love?
How come we were in love?
Tell me how

How come we were in love?
How come we were in love?
How come we were in love?
Tell me how

How come we were in love?
Distance frays, come away
And when the steady comes
There's nothing left for us to say
No one wants the best ones
I take a life of pause
Just so I could be dancing you

How come we were in love?
How come we were in love?
Tell me how
How come we were in love?
How come we were in love?
Tell me how
How come we were in love?
