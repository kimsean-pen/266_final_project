If I could give you the world
On a silver platter
Would it even matter?
You'd still be mad at me
If I could find in all this
A dozen roses
That I would give to you
You'd still be miserable
'Cause in reality

I'm gon' be who I be
And I don't feel no fault
For all the lies that you bought
You can try as you may
Bring me down, but I say
That it ain't up to you
Go on and do what you do

Hate on me, hater

Now or later
'Cause I'm gonna do me
You'll be mad, baby
(Go 'head and hate)
Go 'head and hate on me, hater
'Cause I'm not afraid of
What I've gotta to pay for

You can hate on me
Ooh, if I gave you peaches

Out of my own garden
And I made you a peach pie
Would you slap me high?
Wonder if I gave you diamonds
Out of my own womb

Would you feel the love in that
Or ask, "Why not the moon?"
If I gave you sanity

For the whole of humanity
And had all the solutions
For the pain and pollution
No matter where I live

Despite the things I give
You will always be this way
So go 'head and...
Hate on me, hater

Now or later
'Cause I'm gonna do me
You'll be mad, baby
(Go 'head and hate)

Go 'head and hate on me, hater
'Cause I'm not afraid of
What I've gotta pay for
You can hate on me
Hate on me, hater

Now or later
'Cause I'm gonna do me
You'll be mad, baby
(You cannot hate on me)
Go 'head and hate on me, hater
('Cause my mind is free)

'Cause I'm not afraid of
(Feel my destiny)
What I gotta pay for
(So shall it be)
You can hate on me
You cannot hate on me

Now or later
'Cause I'm gonna do me
You'll be mad, baby

So shall it be!
Go 'head and hate on me, hater
'Cause I'm not afraid of
What I gotta pay for
So shall it be!
You can hate on me
Hate on me

Now or later
'Cause I'm gonna do me
You'll be mad, baby
So shall it be
Go 'head and hate on me, hater
'Cause I'm not afraid of
What I gotta pay for
So shall it be
You can hate on me
