I used to think I had it all
Somehow I fell back into habits that tear me apart
I never got to say I'm sorry
But I can't sleep alone tonight

If it's good for me and it's good for you
If I die tonight, then I'll make it up to you

You're the only thing that gets me high
And I hate it, and I hate it
You're the only thing that gets me high
And I hate it, and I hate it

I'm tangled up in my own image
But I hate who's staring back at me

If it's the truth I seek, it's the truth you'll serve
If my soul is weak, then I'll make it up to you

You're the only thing that gets me high
And I hate it, and I hate it
You're the only thing that gets me high
And I hate it, and I hate it

I'm just a user
I'm just a user
I'm just a user
'Cause I used you up to my end
If you could see me now
I wear a beggar's crown
If I could turn back time
I wouldn't change a fuckin' thing

God, erase me
We don't deserve the life you give
I don't deserve the life you give
God, I can't change at all
We don't deserve the life you give
I don't deserve the life you give

You're the only thing that gets me high
And I hate it, and I hate it
You're the only thing that gets me high
And I hate it, and I hate it
