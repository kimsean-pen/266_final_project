You shouldn't take it
You shouldn't take it so hard - Yeah

Take a look around you - Tell me, what do you see
People with little bits
Try, tryin' to smile
Most of what you've gotten is free - Yeah

You shouldn't take it so hard - Yeah
You shouldn't take it
You shouldn't take it so hard - Yeah

Or get yourself a new name
You want a little bit once in a while
Yeah you got a taste for it
