I wanna have the same last dream again
The one where I wake up and I'm alive
Just as the four walls close me within
My eyes are open up with pure sunlight
I'm the first to know, my dearest friends
Even if your hope has burned with time
Anything that is dead shall be re grown
And your vicious pain, your warning sign
You will be fine
Hey-o here I am

And here we go, life's waiting to begin
Any type of love, it will be shown

Like every single tree reach for the sky

If you're gonna fall, I'll let you know
That I will pick you up, like you for I
I felt this thing I can't replace
When everyone was working for this goal
Where all the children left without a trace
Only to come back as pure as gold to recite this all
Hey-o here I am
And here we go, life's waiting to begin
Tonight
Hey-o here I am

And here we go, lifes waiting to begin
Tonight

Hey-o here I am
And here we go, life's waiting to begin
I can not live, I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me
I can not live, I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me
I can not live, I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me
I can not live, I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me
I can not live, I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me
I can not live, I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me
Hey-o, here I am (do this with me)
Here we go, life's waiting to begin (do this with me)
Hey-o, here I am (do this with me)
Here we go, life's waiting to begin
Life's waiting to begin
