Blind eyes conceal the sun
Burns away all traces of our past
I swear it follows me
And conquers every place we hide

We must now be alone in this cosmos
In liege to this warlike star
And I can feel the gravity
Pulling us apart

We erred in knowing
That we were the last in line
It brings forth fear and fury
To end what we call time

Claw through the blindness
Clinging hard to the past we arrive
With nothing but loneliness
We give ourselves to the tide
