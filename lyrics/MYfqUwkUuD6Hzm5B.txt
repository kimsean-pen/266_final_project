Give me today my daily bread
Help me to walk alone ahead
Though I walk through the darkest valley I will fear no love
Oh my smile my mind reassure me I don't need no one

Woke up this morning with my mind set on loving me
With my mind set on loving me
Woke up this morning with my mind set on loving me
With my mind set on loving me

I'm not lonely, I'm alone
And I'm holy by my own
I'm not lonely, I'm alone
And I'm holy by my own

Ye, the bad days may come
The lover may leave
The winter may not
Hey, the map of your palms
The temple you be
You're all that you got

Ye, the bad days may come
The lover may leave
The winter may not
Hey, the map of your palms
The temple you be
You're all that you got

Though I walk through the darkest valley I will fear no love
Oh my smile my mind reassure me I don't need no one

Woke up this morning with my mind set on loving me
With my mind set on loving me
Woke up this morning with my mind set on loving me
With my mind set on loving me

I'm not lonely, I'm alone
And I'm holy by my own
I'm not lonely, I'm alone
And I'm holy by my own

My cup is full up, what I got is enough
Nobody completes me, don't mess with my stuff
My cup is full up, what I got is enough
Nobody completes me, don't mess with my love
Surely, surely, surely, surely goodness and mercy
Shall follow me
Shall follow me
Shall follow me
