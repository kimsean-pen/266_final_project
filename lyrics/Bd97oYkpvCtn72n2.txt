So come on let's
Chase those memories away
And drink the night into oblivion.
I've been watching you
And memorized every last line of your profile.
Every shade of your complexion
Every tone of your skin
And I am not surprised to find
You in his eyes
Hanging on every word
Dropped from his mouth.
Cos lately I've been watching you
I've been waiting for you to take me home.
So tell me all of your deepest dark secrets
Lying in your arms inseparable.
