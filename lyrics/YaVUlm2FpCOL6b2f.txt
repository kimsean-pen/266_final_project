Nobody ever warns you
Or tells you what to do
She walks away
You're left to stay
Alone
Forever blue

The stars have all stopped shining
The sun just wont break through
Each day's the same
More clouds, more rain
You're left forever blue

Forever blue 'cause you love her
But she doesn't love you
You did your best
Life did the rest
You're left forever blue

No reason left for living
Still, theres a lot to do
New tears to cry
Old songs to sing
And feel forever blue
And be forever...
Blue
