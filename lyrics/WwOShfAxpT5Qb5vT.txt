I'm sorry
I heard about the bad news today
A crowd of people around you
Telling you it's okay
And everything happens for a reason

When you lose a part of yourself
To somebody you know
It takes a lot to let go
Every breath that you remember
Pictures fade away but memory's forever

An empty chair at all the tables
And I'll be seeing you when all my days boil down
But it's better where your going anyway

I'm sorry
I heard about the bad news today
It's really hard to get through
Tough times and long days
But it really just depends on the season

When you lose a part of yourself
To somebody you know
It takes a lot to let go
Every breathe that you remember
The pictures fade away
but memory's forever

An empty chair at all the tables
And I'll be seeing you when all my days boil down
For now well say goodbye
We know its not the last time
I've lost the best part of my day
But its better where your going anyways

An empty chair at all the tables
And I'll be seeing you when all my days boil down

For now we'll say goodbye
We know it's not the last time
I've lost the best part of my day

This is the last thing
I will remember
Its better where you're going anyway
