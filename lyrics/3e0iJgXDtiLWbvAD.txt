With a turn of a key
And a click of a latch
You opened and I fell back

And all the dogs that's in my mind
Filled the room and struck me blind

I think I'm under a nerve attack
(Nerve attack)
I think I'm under a nerve attack
(Nerve attack)
I'll tell ya what this ain't no blast
Ohh it's a nerve attack
A nerve attack oh no

All my atoms are vibrating faster
Don't you touch because I will shatter

My skin is crackin', and so is my brain
Can't catch my breath, get out of my way

I think I'm under a nerve attack
(Nerve attack)
I think I'm under a nerve attack
(Nerve attack)
I'll tell ya what this ain't no blast
Ohh it's a nerve attack
A nerve attack oh no

And all the darkness in my mind
Filled the world and struck me blind

I think I'm under a nerve attack
(Nerve attack)
I think I'm under a nerve attack
(Nerve attack)
This ain't no gas, gas, gas
Ohh it's a nerve attack
A nerve attack
A nerve attack
A nerve attack
Oh no no, no no no
