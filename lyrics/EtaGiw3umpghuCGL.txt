All the tension in the world today
All the little girls fillin' up the world today
With the good comes the bad, the bad comes the good
But I'ma live my life like I should (Like I should)
Now all the critics wanna hit it
To shit-can how we did it
Just because they don't get it
But I'll stay fitted, new era committed
Now this red cap gets a wrap from these critics

Do we always gotta cry? (Always gotta cry)
Do we always gotta live inside a lie? (Live inside a lie)
Life's just a blast, it's movin' really fast
Better stay on top or life'll kick you in the ass

Follow me into a solo, remember that
Kid, so what you wanna do?
And where you gonna run when you're starin' down the cable of a
A mic pointed at your grill like a gun

Limp Bizkit is rockin' the set
It's like Russian Roulette, when you're placin' your bet
So don't be upset when you're broke and you're done
Cause I'ma be the one 'til I jet (I'ma be the one 'til I jet)

I know why you wanna hate me (I know why you wanna hate me)
I know why you wanna hate me (I know why you wanna hate me)
I know why you wanna hate me (I know why you wanna hate me)
Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

I know why you wanna hate me (wanna hate me)
I know why you wanna hate me (I know why you wanna hate me)
Now I know why you wanna hate me (I know why you wanna hate me)
Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

Now you wanna hate me (hate me)
Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
Now you wanna hate me (hate me)
Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

Does anybody really know the secret?
Or the combination for this life, and where they keep it?
It's kinda sad when you don't know the meanin'
But everything happens for a reason (Everything happens for a reason)

I don't even know what I should say
Cause I'm an idiot, a loser, a microphone abuser
I analyze every second I exist
Beatin' up my mind every second with my fist
And everybody wanna run (Wanna run)
Everybody wanna hide from the gun (From the gun)
You can take that ride through this life if you want
But you can't take the edge off the knife (No sir)
And now you want your money back
But you're denied, cause your brain's fried from the sack
And there ain't nothin' I can do
Cause life is a lesson, you learn it when you're through

I know why you wanna hate me (wanna hate me)
I know why you wanna hate me (I know why you wanna hate me)
I know why you wanna hate me (I know why you wanna hate me)
Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

I know why you wanna hate me (wanna hate me)
I know why you wanna hate me (wanna hate me)
Now I know why you wanna hate me (wanna hate me)
Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

Now you wanna hate me
Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

Now you wanna hate me
Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

Now I know why
Now I know why (Now I know why you wanna hate me)
Now I know why (Now I know why you wanna hate me)
Now I know why (Now I know why you wanna hate me)
Now I know why you wanna hate me
Now I know why you wanna hate me
Now I know why you wanna hate me
Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
