It's just the world
That's all it is
Toppling through outer space on a trip
It's just the world
Big and round, now isn't it

Some kind of tropical fish
In a tropical storm
We take a blade in the rib cage
Or some ice age
And we twist until it's warm
You know it's just the world (It was only one)
Trying to be something with an original spin

An unoriginal sin (I've sinned before)
Just with a bottle of Gin oh no
And the girl next door

I think it's spinnin' for mine
You think it's spinnin' for yours
It's spinnin' for sure
But if it's spinnin' for neither
Then really can either
Of us be sure
Just what it's spinnin' for
Oh yeah it's just the world

Trying to be somethin'
Another byzantine, a palestinian
But with original spin (my friend)
And an original sin (oh look I'm sinning again)
Another bottle of Gin (Aha)
And my baby cakes

I think it's spinnin' for mine
You think it's spinnin' for yours
It's spinnin' for sure
But if it's spinnin' for neither
Than really can either
Of us be sure
Just what it's spinnin' for
Oh yeah it's just the world
(oh yeah~)

A little place in outer space on a trip
It's just the world
Were your swim in the sand
Makin' a bed
Playin' in it
Never to stop and think
It might be spinnin' for providence
Really it ain't
No really it ain't
I know it's nice to say

I think it's spinnin' for mine
You think it's spinnin' for yours
It's spinnin' for sure
I think its spinnin' for fun fun fun fun fun
It must be fun to make old mother earth shake
It's just the world (x4)
