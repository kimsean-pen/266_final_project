I was riding the light, I was hip for the night
I was out of control, I was here for the roll
I was polarised, I was paralysed
When you hit me I was hypnotized
Stone cold, you're capsized razor blade funky
Ah, you got me baby, yeah you got me baby
I cry, I scream I saw you pass me by

LA five four 309
LA five four 309
I gotta say it again
I gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
LA five four 309
LA five four 309

A smooch in a party in a relentless engagement
Did I just flatter myself?
Who's there?
Who's over there?
Who's there?
Who said I'd fall?
It's a problem that don't really exist
When you come to life to scrutinize
With your fingertips calling on the back of my spine
Now you're sleeping with the light on
Now you're sleeping with another yeah

I gotta say it again
I gotta, gotta, gotta, yeah
LA five four 309
LA five four 309
I gotta say it again
I gotta, gotta, gotta, yeah
LA five four 309
LA five four 309
LA five four 309
LA five four 309

I was colorblinded by your Frankenstein shoes
Everything on the horizon looked green and blue
It was just a relentless pause into the intuition on my left side
I quickly got out my firelighter
Into the pit, into the pit
I feel sparkling, I'm as happy as can be
Left by the side of the road
The cold shoulder hero is coming for me
I gotta say it again
I gotta, gotta, gotta, yeah
