You're pushing
You're pushing your luck
You're breaking up
I think you've done enough
No sense to me
When did you lose control?
This makes no sense to me
When did you lose?

Keep pushing
You're pushing us down
They're circling around
They're gonna bring you down
This makes no sense to me
When did you lose control?
This makes no sense to me
When did you lose?

This makes no sense to me
When did you lose control?
This makes no sense to me
When did you lose control?

You didn't test the water
You didn't test the water
And now you're flailing as you realise
You'll never make it

You didn't test the water
No you didn't test the water
And now you realise that it's gonna take you
Far from here

And you were never in control
Never in control of this
No you were never in control
Never in control of this

And you surely know
Yeah, you surely know

Are you holding out for rescue?
We're not coming into get you
You must realise there's no one left
For you to hold onto

Taken by the water
You've been taken by the water
Now you're flailing as you realise
You'll never make it

And you were never in control
Never in control of this
No you were never in control
Never in control of this
No you were never in control
Never in control of this

And you surely know
Yeah, you surely know

This makes no sense to me
When did you lose control?
You know this makes no sense to me
When did you lose control?

This makes no sense to me
When did you lose control?
You know this makes no sense to me
When did you lose control?
