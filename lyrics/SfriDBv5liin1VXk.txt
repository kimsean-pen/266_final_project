Spread with green
Effortlessly happy
Didn't think I'd be
Seeing you now

Torn between bliss and envy
Couldn't dig the hole
Wide enough for us so you

Suffer, suffer
Yeah you suffer
Just to feel something real you
Suffer, suffer

"alright, I think you barely know"
"alright, I think I'm ready"

Torn between bliss and envy
Couldn't dig the hole
Wide enough for us so you

Suffer, suffer
Yeah you suffer
Just to feel something real you
Suffer, suffer

I knew I'd find you here
Wallowing in your guilt
You ain't changed a bit
Of that we're clear
I knew I'd find you out
Outside of town
Wrapped around a tree
Where you want to be
Where you want to be

Just to feel something real you
Suffer, suffer
Yeah you suffer
Just to feel something real
