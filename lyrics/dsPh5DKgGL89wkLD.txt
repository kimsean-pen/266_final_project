A dream of a dwelling inside
Alone we come and alone we go
And who am I to know what I feel
Sympathy that's tearing me apart?
Attraction of the distance to a heart or affinity?

What if love will leave your heart an open sore
And I can't reveal what even I don't know
The love you feel you waste away on me
What kind of love would let us bleed away?
No kind of love would make us bleed away

If only you could be
The one to take a look inside
I feel so incomplete
A broken man in need of mother love
I'm suffering in silence
And no one wants to see
And only god is watching as a bleed
A star above, my matching piece

Oh, this love will leave your heart an open sore
And I can't reveal what even I don't know
This love you feel you waste away on me
What kind of love would let us bleed away?
No kind of love would make us bleed away

Feel, that's all you gotta do
And it will heal you
Feel the pain to lead you home to peace of mind
Dwell inside
Feel, that's all you gotta do
And it will heal the wound
Feel, there will be a song for peace of mind
Dwell inside
