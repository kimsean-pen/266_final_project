Shawty, I'ma do things that you ain't never did
Finna wake up next to you in my crib, 'cause
I'ma make you hurt
I'ma, I'ma make you hurt (Hurt!)
I'ma make you hurt
I'ma, I'ma make you hurt (Hurt!)
Shawty, I'ma do things that you ain't never did
Finna wake up next to you in my crib, 'cause
I'ma make you hurt
I'ma, I'ma make you hurt (Hurt!)

I'ma, I'ma make you hurt (Hurt!)

Sadboys, we on deck
Am I awake? I got to check
Went to sleep, then I came back
I'm the same guy smokin' loud pack
Iced-out, right back, PCP attack
Greedy pills hoes on my ball sack
They don't know how to act
High tech watch, high tech locked
Broken Skies, Fantastic Fox
Got keys, but I'll never find the lock
Emotional Boys we in the UFO
Skies pink when I'm on ecstasy
In Tokyo, playin' Mario
Sadboys blastin' your stereos
Suckin' on my nuts like pistachios
Mixin' champagne with carpaccio
Slangin' doe, ho, I'm in that Polo
Stacks of money, more for you
Milkshakes with the crushed up Oreos
I'm in Italy, Rodeo
Forgive me after my death, Caravaggio

Louis duffel bag filled with heroin
Louis goons who finna trip on LSD acid tabs, let 'em in

I'ma make you hurt (Hurt!)
I'ma, I'ma make you hurt (Hurt!)
I'ma make you hurt (Hurt!)
I'ma, I'ma make you hurt (Hurt!)

Bitch, I light up the sky, call me Charmeleon
My life's on the line, I ain't Charmander, but I'm nearly on
Clearly on drugs that will make you hear clearly wrong
Longer than my yearly bong hit
Shawty, thinks she's got style, Leandoer dresses slicker
I'm so iced-out that it's winter, destroy my stupid liver
I be on that Bape shit, you rockin' Quicksilver
Never hesitate shit to pull the trigger
Luxurious, steak before my dinner
Throw Bombay down the river, yeah, you get that picture
Gold and silver 'round my finger
Shawty on that West Side, she a gold digger
Wake up, and I'm a winner
Showerin' in five star, ho, take a look in the mirror
I'm on my grind like all the time
Bitch, I'm Murakami, shawty suckin' on my pastrami
Get that salami

I'ma make you hurt (Hurt!)
I'ma make you hurt (Hurt!)
I'ma, I'ma make you hurt (Hurt!)
I'ma make you hurt (Hurt!)

Shawty, I'ma do things that you ain't never did
Finna wake up next to you in my crib, 'cause
I'ma make you hurt (Hurt!)
I'ma, I'ma make you hurt (Hurt!)
I'ma make you hurt
I'ma, I'ma make you hurt (Hurt!)
Shawty, I'ma do things that you ain't never did
Finna wake up next to you in my crib, 'cause
I'ma make you hurt
I'ma, I'ma make you hurt (Hurt!)
I'ma make you hurt (Hurt!)
I'ma, I'ma make you hurt (Hurt!)

I'ma, I'ma, I'ma make you hurt

Sadboys!
