Close the doors pushing down all the dominoes
ain't no lights in the skylit garage turned bedroom
all the scent from your neck to my lungs
flicker one by one lay me down and away we go
It's in your bed in your head I'll come running on time
lonesome doves on the roof how they are mocking our lives
all the matches tonight are funeral fires
flicker on and on lay it down and away we go
when it's over we can fly are you certain of ancient ways of life
My days are numbered falling under chasing all the dominoes
don't wanna let you go
never gonna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
but I've got to leave you at home
My days are numbered falling under chasing all the dominoes
far too long
don't wanna let you go
never gonna let you go
for too long
