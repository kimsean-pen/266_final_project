Hang me, oh, hang me, I'll be dead and gone.
Hang me, oh, hang me, I'll be dead and gone.
I wouldn't mind the hanging but the laying in the grave so long
Poor boy, I've been all around this world.

I been all around Cape Girardeau, parts of Arkansas
All around Cape Girardeau, parts of Arkansas
Got so goddamn hungry I could hide behind a straw
Poor boy, I've been all around this world.

Went up on the mountain, there I made my stand
Went up on the mountain, there I made my stand
A rifle on my shoulder and a dagger in my hand
Poor boy, I've been all around this world.

Hang me, oh, hang me and I'll be dead and gone.
Hang me, oh, hang me and I'll be dead and gone.
I wouldn't mind the hanging but the laying in the grave so long
Poor boy, I've been all around this world.

Put the rope around my neck, hung me up so high
Put the rope around my neck, hung me up so high
The last words I heard them say: "Won't be long now 'fore you die"
Poor boy, I've been all around this world.

Hang me, oh, hang me and I'll be dead and gone.
Hang me, oh, hang me, I'll be dead and gone.
I wouldn't mind the hanging but the laying in the grave so long
Poor boy, I've been all around this world.
