God damn, well let's do a tune called "Rawhide," okay
God damn tape's rollin', let's go

Let's move 'em out
One, two, three, four

Rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin'

Keep rollin' rollin' rollin'
Though the streams are swollen
Keep them doggies rollin'
Keep them doggies rollin'
Keep them doggies rollin'

Rawhide - Don't try to understand them
Just rope, throw and brand 'em
Soon they'll be kneeling high and wide

Movin' movin' movin'
Movin' movin' movin'
Movin' movin' movin'

Keep movin' movin' movin'
Though they're disapprovin'
Keep them doggies movin'
Keep them doggies movin'
Keep them doggies movin'

Rawhide - If you're ever wondering whether
Hay will make more leather
Question the girl by my side

All the things I'm missin'
Good viddles, love and kissin'
Are waitin' at the end of my ride

Move 'em out head 'em up get 'em up
Move 'em out head 'em up get 'em up
Rawhide
Somehow I think I need a Maserati
To ride 'em in

Rawhide - Rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin'

Rawhide - Rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin'

Rawhide - Rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
