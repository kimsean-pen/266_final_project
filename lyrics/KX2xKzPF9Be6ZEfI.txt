Ba da pa pa ba da pa pa... Come here
Pretty please
Can you tell me where I am?
You
Won't you say something?
I need to get my bearings
I'm lost
And the shadows keep on changing

And I'm haunted
By the lives that I have loved
And actions I have hated
I'm haunted
By the lives that wove the web
Inside my haunted head
Ba da pa pa, ba da pa pa Don't cry

There's always a way
Here in November in this house of leaves we'll pray
Please, I know it's hard to believe
To see a perfect forest through so many splintered trees
You and me
And these shadows keep on changing
And I'm haunted
By the lives that I have loved
And actions I have hated

I'm haunted
By the promises I've made and others I have broken
I'm haunted
By the lives that wove the web
Inside my haunted head
Hallways... always
I'll always want you
I'll always need you
I'll always love you
And I will always miss you

Ba da pa pa ba da pa pa...

Come here
No I won't say please
One more look at the ghost
Before I'm gonna make it leave

Come here
I've got the pieces here

Time to gather up the splinters
Build a casket for my tears
I'm haunted
(By the lives that I have loved)
I'm haunted
(By the promises I've made)
I'm haunted
By the hallways in this tiny room
The echo there of me and you
The voices that are carrying this tune
Ba da pa pa... (x12, to fade)
(Father: What is it, Annie?)
(Daughter: You think I'll cry? I won't cry! My heart will break before I cry!)
(Daughter: I will go mad.)
