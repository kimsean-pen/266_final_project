I only wanted to thank you
For telling me just how it is
Never knew what to believe in
'Till I heard the words straight from your lips
I only wanted to ask you not to give up on me yet
And I'll find my way through the darkness
As long as your voice is there in my head

You get me through
You help me get by
You speak the truth
When every thing else is a lie

Trapped in a world without colors
Everything's so black and white
You taught me how to discover
You showed the way, you opened my eyes

You get me through
You help me get by
You speak the truth
When every thing else is a lie

You get me through
You help me get by

You speak the truth
When every thing else is a lie

It's a lot of things all at once
But maybe we can figure it out together, together
It's a lot of things all at once
But maybe we can figure it out together, together

You get me through
You help me get by
You speak the truth
When every thing else is a lie

You get me through
You help me get by
You speak the truth
When every thing else is a lie

You get me through
You help me get by
You speak the truth
When every thing else is a lie
