You show up like a hurricane
All hungry-eyed and weather-stained
The clock forgets to tick and I the same
I died the day you disappeared
So why would you be welcome here
Ride the wind that brought you back away

No you can't come in
No you can't come in

I cannot stop my rebel hands
From pulling out the pots and pans
I left you in the cold until you shook
You're gentle now but I recall
Both tender fire and bitter squall
A history so deep it hurts to look

No you can't come in
No you can't come in
No you can't, you can't come in

If the sea should swallow up my house
I will turn the rooftop inside out
And the wind will be wailing
But I will be sailing faster

Oh the elements I do not fear
But I fall apart when you appear
'Cause you are the greatest
The greatest disaster

If the sea should swallow up my house
I will turn the rooftop inside out
And the wind will be wailing
But I will be sailing faster
