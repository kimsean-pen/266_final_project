One look & you can take me down.
But I'd be offering it,
But I'd be offering it.
Despite my stare
Giving the chance I go for it
One step at a time
One step at a time.

Girl, you're know I like you
Girl, you're know I like you.
Girl you made me crazy
Girl you made me crazy.

Heart is all scars
when you not around.
So, give me a chance
But I know You'd be offering it
One step at a time
One step at a time ooh.

Girl, you're know I like you
Girl, you're know I like you.
Girl you made me crazy
Girl you made me crazy.

But I know that You'd be offering it
But I know that You'd be offerin'
But I know that You'd be offering it
But I know that You'd be offerin'

Girl, you're know I like you
Girl, you're know I like you.
Girl you made me crazy
Girl you made me crazy.
