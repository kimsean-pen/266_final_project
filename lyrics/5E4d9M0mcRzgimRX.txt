Glide (Baby, baby)
Glide (Baby, baby)
Take it (take it) back (back)
Take it (take it) back (back)

Had to pick my shit up and had to get on out (get on out)
Had to pick my shit up and had to get on out (so fly with em*)
Pack my bags y'all, we gotta dip
Fuck is you doin' (Fuck is you doin')
Lady killer with the magnimo* hip
Girl I put you through it (damn)

Glide (Baby, baby)
Take it (take it) back (back)
Glide (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Take it (take it) back (back)
Away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away

I used to think that the drive was bad (bad)
Shit got brazy with the more we had (shit fuckin' brazy)
Hop the fence for that greener grass
Fuck the slums we ain't going back (we ain't going back)
Glide (Baby, baby)
Take it (take it) back (back)
Glide (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Take it (take it) back (back)
Glide

Glide away
Away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away
Glide

Imma take your bitch out back (fuck)
Glide on in ya
Pull up and throw a stack

Glide away now
Imma take your bitch out back
Glide on him now
Before a lover throws his stacks*
Glide

Glide
Take it away (Away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away)
Glide
(Away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away)
So fly
So we can feel complete
Once more
So we can feel complete
Once more
So we can feel complete
Once more
So we can feel complete
