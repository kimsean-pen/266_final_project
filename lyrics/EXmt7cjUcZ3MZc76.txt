Just hold your breath to make sure you won't wake up again.
Cause you ruined my '04.
That's the best that I could hope for to watch you fall apart from the inside.
We're gonna spread it to the world,
to the world about how you lied.
How you lied.

A free lesson on growing up.
Never trust anyone to the point.
Where your backs exposed.
Every person I've ever known was a fake and you'll see your closest ones go first.
Who needs enemies you've got friends.

I'm a gentleman and you're a liar.
I expect the best of you but it's so hard.
But it's so hard.
I'm a gentleman and you're a liar.
I expect the best of you but it's so hard.
But it's so hard.

Let's start over when we reach the top. Well, watch you bury yourself this wasn't easy.
It wasn't easy.

A free lesson on growing up.
Make the best of their worst
and never compromise what you feel is right.
I make a point to be powerful when I speak.
Be the one that gives them nightmares when they sleep.
Never back down from anyone.
