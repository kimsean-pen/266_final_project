I am the darkness
The pain in your eyes
I am the reason there's nothing left inside

Won't give up
Won't give in
I won't surrender to you
Screaming out
Falling down
As I lose myself in you

And now it's taking over
The darkness deep inside
I feel it growing colder
...
You're my obsession
The reason I bleed
You're the infection that spreads inside of me

Can't deny
Can't resist
I'm addicted to you
Pull me down
Hit the ground
Cause I've got nothing left to lose

And now it's taking over
Your darkness deep inside
I feel it growing colder
It's taking me alive
I feel it coming closer
And I'm next in line
And now it's almost over
...
And now it's taking over
Your darkness deep inside
I feel it growing colder
It's taking me alive
I feel it coming closer
And I'm next in line
And now it's almost over
