To penetrate beyond the muscle wall's inner regions
First you was icin me, connect with the starin at the speakers

You shy now, got a lot of things on your mind now
You don't feel fly now, you huntin the exit sign down

Don't understand how I ran the line down? Rewind now

YO!! We be the most magnetic, so athletic
Leave your peeps on the side so they can watch you and your mans get it
Take the arch rivalry stance up on the podium
And give the flavor to niggas but keep it low on sodium
Posess shit that got you wonderin how we holdin em
Things that'll lay you out like a piece of linoleum
Bring who-ever you want, we bout to bug son and bounce
Down to Henry Hudson, after I bust one!
