Slow jam
Coming with memory
Don't live for nostalgia
But the impact of everything resonates

What I wear in my hair?
Grease in the air
Dax in days of somewhere that I knew
Knew me too, flip the cheque, turn the deck
But never turn the sound down

What it was then make it now
Bring it over, throwback, bring it on
Got my knickers in a twist
Broke some glass, broken politics
Try to bring it on

It's my politics living in the slow jam
Everything low, rain slow
Play for supreme
Delightful, painful
Play with me synchronised
I'm a Pisces hanging from the vine
Live it out a day at a time

My name is Neneh
March tenth
What a sign

It's my politics living in the slow jam
Playful, supreme
Delightful, hateful
Play with me
It's my politics living in the slow dance
Synchronised devotion
I'm a Pisces hanging from the vine
Live it out a day at a time

It's my politics living in the slow jam
Playful, supreme
Delightful, hateful
Play with me
It's my politics living in the slow dance
Synchronised devotion
I'm a Pisces hanging from the vine
Live it out a day at a time

It's my politics living in the slow jam
Playful
It's my politics living in the slow jam
You can take me to the Garden of Eden
Lead me there
And see me play
You can take me to the Garden of Eden
Lead me there
And see me play

Take me to my, to my tomb
And see me play
