It was a formal kiss, it's what i'm gonna miss
i'm in the mudd stumble around like a sick bug
i close my eyes to take me back
she toucht my leg

I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you
I wanna see you smiling on a blue afternoon
dreaming of the celing and the smell of your room
cuz I want you, I want you, I want you

when the afternoon sweet breeze comes trough, bringing with it a cooler so i feel brand new

I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you
I wanna se you smiling on a blue afternoon
dreaming of the celing and the smell of your room
cuz I want you, I want you, I want you

everyday i'm growing older
time is all, i have to hold her
everyday im growing older
time is old all, i have to hold her

I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you
I wanna see you smiling on a blue afternoon
dreaming of the celing and the smell of your room
cuz I want you, I want you, I want you
