(Verse One)
Sometimes you feel your world is breaking down
Baby don't stop
There's trouble everywhere, it's all around
Baby don't stop

Cos I'm here to turn the corner with you
When we're together, there's nothing that we can't do

(Chorus)
You signed my name on your arm
You put so much in my heart
When the darkness rolls in
I'll be there through thick and thin
I want you to know, I want you to know
I'll never stop loving you
I hope that you know, wherever you go
I'll never stop loving you

(Verse Two)
When you're on the road, lonely and blue
Baby please stop
Remember all the things we've been through
All the good stuff

Take all the notes you wrote to me
And all the things that we believe
People thought that we couldn't be
No, we never stop
No, we never stop

(Chorus)
You signed my name on your arm
You put so much in my heart
When the darkness rolls in
I'll be there through thick and thin
I want you to know, I want you to know
I'll never stop loving you
I hope that you know, wherever you go
I'll never stop loving you

(Middle-8)
We made mistakes along the way
But here we are, here we are

Never stop, never stop, never stop
Never stop, never stop, never stop
Never stop, never stop, never stop
Never stop, never stop, never stop

(Chorus)
You signed my name on your arm
You put so much in my heart
When the darkness rolls in
I'll be there through thick and thin
I want you to know, I want you to know
I'll never stop loving you
I hope that you know, wherever you go
I'll never stop loving you
I want you to know, I want you to know
I'll never stop loving you
I hope that you know, wherever you go
I'll never stop loving you
