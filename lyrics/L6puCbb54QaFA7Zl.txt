I dreamt of a move
a great move
to another place with much more land
I was driven by car
and woke before I got there
I remember the place and it was beautiful

A friends a friend who knows what being a friend is, talking with a friend.
As friends we were always so close but so far away...
friends in life are special do you want me as your special friend?
Cause you're the friend that I've been searching for.

There was more for me
It would be more open
scary to think that I could be happy
she'd said it was the same road

but up more, alot more
just be patient and we'll get there

I never got there
but the morning brings light
and so, I'll keep on looking.
