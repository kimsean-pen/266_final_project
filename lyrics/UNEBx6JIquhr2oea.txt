Summer
It turns me upside down
Summer, summer, summer
It's like a merry-go-round

I see you under the midnight
All shackles and bows
High shoes with the cleats are clickin'
A temperamental glow
Oh, don't you let me go

Oh, I got a hold on you
I got a hold on you
I got a hold on you tonight
(Night)
Oh, I got a hold on you
I got a hold on you
(Got a hold on you)
I'll check

(Oh-oh, it's magic)
When I'm with you
(Oh, it's magic)
(Oh-oh it's magic)
To know the magic
You know it's true
I gotta hold on you

Oh, twisted
Under, sideways, down
I know you're getting twisted
And you can't calm down

I see you under the midnight
Love darts in your eyes
How far can you take it
'Til you realize
There's magic in your eyes?

I got a hold on you
I got a hold on you
I got a hold on you tonight
(Night)
I got a hold on you
(Got a hold on you)
I got a hold on you
(Got a hold on you)
Yeah, yeah, uh

(Oh-oh, it's magic)
Oh-oh, when I'm with you
(Oh it's magic)
(Oh-oh, it's magic)
Just a little bit of the magic
Who's being true?
I got a hold on you

I've got a hold on you
I got a hold on you
(Got a hold on you)
Lets try, it's magic
(Oh-oh, it's magic)
Oh-oh, it's magic
When I'm with you
(Oh-oh)
(It's magic)
(Oh-oh, it's magic)
Just to know the magic
(Oh-oh, it's magic)
Yes I do
(Oh-oh, it's magic)
(Oh-oh, it's magic)
Just a little bit of magic
(Oh-oh, it's magic)
That's true, when I'm with you
(Oh-oh, it's magic)
(Gotta be magic)
The magic pulls me through
Oh it's magic
(Oh-oh it's magic)
