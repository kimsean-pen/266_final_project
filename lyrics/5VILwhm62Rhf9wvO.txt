Feeling the breeze of change
Lethargy rolls over me again
Like sap over a midge
Is it real or just pretend?
It's alive in the dark
And it knows where
I'm going to be
Forever returning again and again
Into the house
Into the den

Elastic stretched and strained
I know I could change
This shirt is ripped and stained
And you're pushing familiar drugs again

You're pushing it
I can't resist
I feel you under my skin
Pushing familiar drugs again

Feeling the turning tides
Indifference takes hold again
Like mist over the lake
Is it real or is it fake?
I won't fight the gravity
Let the current take me where it please
Right down the fucking drain
Into my lungs
Into my veins

Elastic stretched and strained
I know I could change
This shirt is ripped and stained
And you're pushing familiar drugs again

You're pushing it
I can't resist
I feel you under my skin
Pushing familiar drugs again

You're pushing it
I can't resist
I feel you under my skin
Pushing familiar drugs again

You're pushing familiar drugs
You're pushing familiar drugs again
You keep pushing familiar drugs
You keep pushing familiar drugs
Again and again
