You love your rhythm and poetry,
I love my sins.
My 'international mystery.'
I let you in.

You hate the odd gap between my teeth.
I love your curls.
Your skin I want to get underneath
My pin-up girl.

Let's make out,
On the cover of magazines.
We'll be king and queen.
Let's get lost,
In the forest of gold and green.
We're strangers in a dream.

You love your bags of potato chips.
I love them too.
"Who'll make the next refrigerator trip?"
It's always you.

I hate your long list ex's.
You love my eyes.
Our clothes, we share, they are unisex,
Lovers in disguise.

Let's make out,
On the cover of magazines.
We'll be king and queen.
Let's get lost,
In the forest of gold and green.
We're strangers in a dream.
