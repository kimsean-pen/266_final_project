Uh, You know what?
On the real?
Um
Me and you
We been through
So much that we should start off new
You need to choose
Don't be confused
I think it's time
Time that you
(Tell me where you wanna...)
Be with me
Be with her
This whole ordeal is such a blur
I was prepared to take a loss
But my heart won't pay the cost
(You don't know where you wanna be)
You don't have to take
My advice
You don't have to compromise
Cuz' I know that you don't realize
That you don't even see
Where you need to be
Be with them
All your friends
Claim the Clippers is playin Boston
I won't play sloppy seconds again
Do you wanna play with me
Or play with them?
(Tell me where you wanna...)
Be in love
Is that enough?
When all the problem are adding up
Ladies raise your hands if ya had enough
Scream as loud as you can if ya had enough
Cuz he don't know
(Why don't ya know it honey?)
Where he wants to be
You don't have to take
My advice
You don't have to compromise
Cuz' I know that you don't realize
That you don't even see
Where you need to be
Don't talk like that
(Ay, ay, ay)
I promise in all honesty
I honor you, you honor me
For better, worst, rich or poor
Whatever it's gonna be
I'm talkin' bout forever more
The rest of eternity
No need in bein' insecure
I know where I wanna be
I know I made a lot of mistakes
But I can make 'em up, make 'em up
Unless you got your heart
Set on breakin' up
If I can't see your face
Then my day
Ain't even worth wakin' up
Especially with these haters
And no good cases pilin' up
Maybe show you attention
Is somethin' that I ain't done enough
But you got all my love, on all I love
Girl I need you to believe in me
You need to know that I know where I need to be
(Ay, ay)
You don't have to take
My advice
You don't have to compromise
Cuz' I know that you don't realize
That you don't even see
Where you need to be
You don't have to take
My advice
You don't have to compromise
Cuz' I know that you don't realize
That you don't even see
Where you need to be
