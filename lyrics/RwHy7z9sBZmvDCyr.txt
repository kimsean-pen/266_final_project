Male on male you really got me confused
at the gay wedding
baby wedding
gay baby, male on male

I could tell it by the look on your eyes
I embarrassed you in front of your friends
and the lesbians and that awful dog of yours with my question

Where's the bride, oh where?
Where's the bride, oh where?

Gay on gay, it's really hard to see straight
at the gay wedding
baby wedding
gay baby,
male on male

you told me please don't you get too drunk
and then I saw you kissing other girl

Where's the bride, oh where?
Where's the bride, oh where?
