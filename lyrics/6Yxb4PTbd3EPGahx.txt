I can still find Wiley's house
Riding on my bike with eyes closed
I can name every girl that he took out
And from my memory, dial his house phone

Can you take me back when we were just kids
Who weren't scared of getting older?
Yeah, yeah
'Cause no one knows you like they know you
And no one probably ever will
You can grow up, make new ones
But truth is there's nothing like old friends
Oooh
'Cause you can't make old friends
Oooh
Mmm yeah

I can still feel the windows down
Listening to Jimmy Eat World
rRding 3-wide on Blake's bench seat, yeah
My God, it's been ten years now
I would have his back tomorrow
And he'd still fight anyone who tried to touch me

Can you take me back when we were just kids
Who weren't scared of getting older?
Yeah, yeah
'Cause no one knows you like they know you
And no one probably ever will
You can grow up, make new ones
But truth is there's nothing like old friends
Oooh
'Cause you can't make old friends
Oooh

And I've got some good friends now
But I've never seen their parents' back porch
I wouldn't change how things turned out
But there's no one in this time zone
Who knows what inline skates that I wore

Can you take me back when we were just kids
Who weren't scared of getting older?
Oooh
'Cause no one knows you like they know you
And no one probably ever will
You can grow up, make new ones
But the truth is
That we grow up, then wish we could go back then
There's nothing like old friends
Oooh
'Cause you can't make old friends
Oooh
