Eternal fury, the wrath within
Scorched by the fires that sent me
Battle on into the night
In shallow graves, they will suffer

Smash everything around you, it's all yours if you wish
Give and take in the palm of your hand, return us all where we begin
Spun of earth, masked and secret, liars hide inside us all
With sharpened teeth vast that never end; to the gallows, we descend

Lost to the patterns of pitch and smoke
Where we will beg
Outside asylum that can't exist
Where we will beg, where we will beg

All those who oppose us pushed down and stamped out
Behold the crown of misery
A question of violent faith, to question all of Man
Behold the crown of misery
A question of violent faith, to question all of Man

All those who oppose us pushed down and stamped out

Lost to the patterns of pitch and smoke
Where we will beg
Outside asylum that can't exist
Where we will beg, where we will beg

Eternal fury, the wrath within
Scorched by the fires that sent me
Battle on into the night
In shallow graves, they will suffer

Behold the crown of misery
A question of violent faith, to question all of Man
Behold the crown of misery
A question of violent faith, to question all of Man
