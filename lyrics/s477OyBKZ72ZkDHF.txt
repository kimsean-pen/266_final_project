Spotcheck billy got down on his hands & knees
He said hey momma, hey let me check your oil alright?
She said no, no honey, not tonite,
Comeback monday, well you comeback tuesday, then i might.

I said juanita, my sweet juanita, what are you up to?
My juanita. i said juanita, my sweet taquita,
What are you up to? my juanita.

Well, i dont want nobody who wont die for dance.
Dont throw me no speed cars cause i die tryin.
Throw me line, throw me a dime.
Cause theres a fat man in the bathtub with the blues.
I hear you moan, i hear you moan--moan

Billy got so sad, dejected, put on his hat and started to run.
Runnin down the street and yellin at the top of his lungs
all i want in this life and time is some good clean fun,

All i want in this life and time is some hit and run!

I said juanita, my sweet juanita, what are you up to?
My juanita. i said juanita, my sweet taquita,
What are you up to? my juanita

Well i put my money in your meter baby so it wont run down,
But you got me in a squeeze play on the cheesey side of town.
Throw me line, now show me a sign.
Cause theres a fat man in the bathtub with the blues
I hear you moan, i hear you moan, yea
