She said lets change our luck
This night is all we've got
Drive fast until we crash
This Dead End life

Sweet dreams that won't come true
I'd leave it all for you
Brick walls are closing in
Let's make a run tonight

Blinded by the lights...
Hold you through forever
Won't let you go

'Cause if you jump, I will jump too
We will fall together
From the building's ledge
Never looking back at what we've done
We'll just say it was love
'Cause I would die for you on Skyway Avenue
She said don't change your mind

Let's leave this town behind
We'll race right off the cliff
They will remember this
It all got so mundane

with you I'm back again
Just take me by the hand
We're close to the edge
Blinded by the lights...

Hold you through forever
Won't let you go
'Cause if you jump, I will jump too

We will fall together
From the building's ledge
Never looking back at what we've done
We'll just say it was love
'Cause I would die for you on Skyway Avenue
Where are your guts to fly?
Soaring through

Through the night
And if you take that last step I'll follow you
Leave the edge and fly
We're finally alive
'Cause if you jump, I will jump too
We will fall together
From the building's ledge
Never looking back at what we've done
We'll just say it was love
'Cause I would die for you on Skyway Avenue
So what's left to prove?
We have made it through
