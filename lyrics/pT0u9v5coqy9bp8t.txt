Malevolent criminal, I
When the vision paints my mind
Cross the invisible line
And you'll be paid in kind
Malevolent criminal, I
When the vision paints my mind
Cross the invisible line
And you'll be paid in kind

Hit it!

Criminal, the suffering
It makes me think like a criminal, the suffering
When we're alone
Criminal, the suffering
It makes me feel like a criminal, the suffering
When we're alone

Typical enough for me
That I burn inside in agony
What power will enable me
To bury my vision
A hunger coming over me
As I learn to hide the agony
To make a final remedy
To close the door once and for all

In a world that I don't want to know
With a message that I never want to send
To be free from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Don't tell me I cannot go
With a wound that refuses to mend
Deliver me from all of this
I want you to quicken my end

(It seems the whole experience is)
Terrible and crippling
The pain is much more than physical beyond belief
When we're alone

Typical enough for me
That I burn inside in agony
What power will enable me
To make this decision
Despair has fallen over me
No way to hide the agony
Embracing my calamity
To save myself once and for all

In a world that I don't want to know
With a message that I never want to send
To be free from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Don't tell me I cannot go
With a wound that refuses to mend
Deliver me from all of this
I want you to quicken my end

Now, you want to know, you want a name
You want to call me motherfucker
Now, you want to know, you want a name
You want to say it doesn't matter
Now, you want to know, you want a name
You want to call me motherfucker
Now, you want to know, you want a name
You want to say it doesn't matter now
Now that you want to know, now you want a name
Now you want a place, now you want a time
Now you want it all
Now that you want to know, now you want a name
Now you want a place, now you want a time
Now you want it all now!

In a world that I don't want to know
With a message that I never want to send
To be free from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Don't tell me I cannot go
With a wound that refuses to mend
Deliver me from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Don't say that it isn't so
I'm on a path that you'll never comprehend
Set me free from all of this
I need you to quicken my end
