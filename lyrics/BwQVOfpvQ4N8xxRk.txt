'Cause I know
You've got a lot on your plate and
Class after work lately

And I know
You never catch any breaks and
I feel the same way

I'm not at my best now
Even stressed out
Obsessive compulsive
Pullin' my hair out in bunches

Just try to breath slow
Make both of your lungs full
I'll follow my heart to be wherever you are

I could just hold you here
Forever
Hold you here
I'll never need more
I'll never need more

'Cause I know
We've both have seen what it takes but
Somehow we still made it
And I hope
The sun continues to raise like the rent that we're paying

I'm not at my best now
And feelin' stressed out
I'm late on the payment
One bill from endin' up bankrupt
Homeless in the distance stretched out between us
I'll follow my heart to be wherever you are

I could just hold you here
Forever
Hold you here
I'll never need more
I'll never need more

I could just hold you here
Forever
Hold you here
I'll never need more
I'll never need more

I'm at my worst without you
Full of doubt
I had a shed of blue

I'm at my best with you
I never knew
That I was missing out
'Cause you love me all the way

I could just hold you here
Forever
Hold you here
I'll never need more
I'll never need more

I could just hold you here
Forever
Hold you here
I'll never need more
I'll never need more
