One thousand hands pull you down into dark waters
Victimized time of life on earth expired
Coldly served the vengeance damning murder in the first degree
Fodder for the oaken box so lined with velvet tapestry

Descent imminent bladder and bowels into pants spent
The glow is waning in your eyes what's coming next is no surprise
Death phlegm rattles
Terrible the choking swansong
Rapid decline when old age brings burdens cumbersome

Cruelly dealt the sickness growing malignancies triumphantly
Destroyed you from the inside out begging for death insistently

Into the everblack
From where there's no coming back
Six feet below the earth
Rotting food for the fetid worms
Into the harrowed grave
Your mortal soul cannot be saved
Into the nether realm
Dead as slate and cold as hell

Rest in festering slime
Here burns the souls of a thousand generations
Join the club

Funereality
Headstones towering above
S'far as the eye can see
Condemned to hell so morbidly
My friend you'll never see
Lost forever in between
In revenance you've been deceived
what you have prayed for shall not be
Your hollow cries he has denied
Your weak religion dies
With thee a feeble cross insignia of fabled gods
You'll haunt a landscape draped in grey
Deceased and meant to be
To push the daisies up eternally your name is here in stone

Into the everblack
From where there's no coming back
(Coming back)
Six feet below the earth
Rotting food for the fetid worms
Into the harrowed grave
Your mortal soul cannot be saved
Into the nether realm
Dead as slate and cold as hell
