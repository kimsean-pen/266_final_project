yeah
ohhhh
yeah
ohhh
baby in the morning, pour me your dreams
don't bring me coffee, i'm somewhere in between
baby in the morning, sing me your dreams
I was sadly drifting and the lion followed me
the colours i've not seen before
they were invented in my head
or was it that i left this world to the land of the undead
where were you last night (she said), I was playing the flute
in front of the eiffel tower, to the man in the starlight suit
then it was when you came in, I recognised your eyes
you were with the lion and you started to cry
(be ok)
everybody's gone, there's nothing left
baby in the morning, pour me your dreams
don't bring me coffee, i'm somewhere in between
baby in the morning, don't wake me too soon
lying in saturn in the middle of the moon
coming down the mountain, i'm not one, i'm two
holy angel cradle me to the land of the undead
end :)
