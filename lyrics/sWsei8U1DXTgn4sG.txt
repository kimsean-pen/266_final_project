Run away, run away if you can't speak
Turn a page on the world that you don't need
Wide awake and you're scared that you won't come down, now...

Didn't I tell you, you were gonna break down?
Didn't I warn you? Didn't I warn you?
Better take it easy
Try to find a way out
Better start believing in yourself

We build it up, we tear it down
We leave our pieces on the ground
We see no end, we don't know how
We are lost and we're fallen

Hold on to me, you're all I have
All I have
Hold on to me, you're all I have
All I have

Now and then there's a light in the darkness
Feel around 'til you find where your heart went
There's a weight in the air but you can't see why
Why...

Didn't I tell you, you were gonna break down?
Didn't I want you? Everybody wants you
Tell me what you're needin'
Give in to your bleedin'
Never really feeling for yourself

We build it up, we tear it down
We leave our pieces on the ground
We see no end, we don't know how
We are lost and we're fallen

Hold on to me, you're all I have
All I have
Hold on to me, you're all I have
All I have

Didn't I tell you, you were gonna break down?
Didn't I warn you? Didn't I warn you?
Better take it easy
Try to find a way out
Better start believing in yourself

We build it up, we tear it down
We leave our pieces on the ground
We see no end, we don't know how
We are lost and we're fallen
Hold on to me, you're all I have
All I have
Hold on to me, you're all I have
All I have
Can you hold on to me?
Can you hold on to me?
Run away, run away if you can't speak...
