When I was just a little girl
I asked my Mother, "What will I be?
Will I be pretty? Will I be rich?"
Here's what she said to me:

"Oue sera sera, Whatever will be, will be.
The future's not ours to see.
Que sera, sera, What will be, will be."

When I grew up and fell in love
I asked my lover, "What will I be?
Will I have rainbows Day after day"
Here's what my lover said:

"Que sera, sera, Whatever will be, will be.
The future's not ours to see.
Que sera, sera, What will be, will be."

Now I have children of my own,
They ask their Mother, "What will I be?
Will I be handsome? Will I be rich?"
I tell them tenderly:

"Que sera sera, Whatever will be, will be.
The future's not ours to see.
Que sera, sera, What will be, will be."
