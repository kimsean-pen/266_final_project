I woke up sad
I don't know why
All the lives I've had
Have made me cry

In the sky, a vision
A calling, a mission

No heart is a villain
No heart will be killing
Get the truth out to the youth

No heart is a villain
No heart will be killing
Get the truth out to the youth

The angels are far
'Cause most people are
Not born under a star

Still I was crying at birth
Hurt from falling onto earth
Hunger and thirst
Not knowing what to deal with first

I was reaching out my hands
Hoping someone would understand
Come on, raise your hands
If you think you understand

Though my memories scream
Maybe it was all just a dream

I woke up sad
I don't know why
All the lives I've had
Have made me cry

In the sky, a vision
A calling, a mission

No heart is a villain
No heart will be killing
Get the truth out to the youth

No heart is a villain
No heart will be killing
Get the truth out to the youth

No heart is a villain
No heart will be killing
Get the truth out to the youth

No heart is a villain
No heart will be killing
Get the truth out to the youth

No heart is a villain
No heart will be killing
Get the truth out to the youth

No heart is a villain
No heart will be killing
Get the truth out to the youth
