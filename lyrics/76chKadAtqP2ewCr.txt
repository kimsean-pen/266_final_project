If you want me to wait,
I will wait for you
If you tell me to stay,
I would stay right through
If you don't wanna say,
Anything at all
I'm happy wondering

Go!

Yeah, yeah!

Since I was a young man
I never was a fun man
I never had a plan and no security then
Ever since I met you
I never could forget you
I only wanna get you right here next to me

'Cause everybody (a-wha-oh-oh)
Needs someone that they can trust and,
You're somebody(a-wha-oh-oh)
That I found just in time

If you want me to wait,
I will wait for you
If you tell me to stay,
I would stay right through
If you don't wanna say,
Anything at all
I'm happy wondering.

Now my life is changing
It's always rearranging
It's always getting stranger than I thought it ever could
Ever since I found you
I wanna be around you
I wanna get down to the point that I need you

'Cause everybody (a-wha-oh-oh)
Needs someone that they can trust and,
You're somebody(a-wha-oh-oh)
That I found just in time

If you want me to wait,
I will wait for you
If you tell me to stay,
I would stay right through
If you don't wanna say,
Anything at all
I'm happy wondering
Go!

Yeah, yeah!

yeah, yeah...

Don't tell me
The bad news
Don't tell me anything at all
Just tell me
That you need me
And stay right here with me

If you want me to wait,
I will wait for you
If you tell me to stay,
I will stay right through
If you don't wanna say,
Anything at all
I'm happy wondering
