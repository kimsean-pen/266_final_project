I could've sworn that you knew my conscience was not clean,
You fade in and fade out.
Crawling up into nothing at your feet.

You're going to leave me all alone again,
Don't say you never did.
And by the time I get to know you in this shell of emptiness,
I'm drowning.

See my fate.
See all.
It's such a shame.

Fake what you love.
And I've had enough.
And there's a colder side to you that we've not seen,
You fade in and fade out.
Crawling up into nothing at your feet.

Lay your hands on me.
Pull me out from the background.

Falling at your feet.
Find me out,
Cut me open.

Show me how you weep and spill your heart to me.

I never know what it's telling you,
I hope that it is "stay".

Take a look at what I've left for you,
This pain to wash away.
I'm drowning.

See my fate.
See all.
It's such a shame.

Lay your hands on me.
Pull me out from the background.

Falling at your feet.
Find me out,
Cut me open.

God save us men.
Cut by a jagged edge.
Fall to your knees.
Defeat shadows me.

I could've sworn that you knew my conscience was not clean.
Saw a hole in me.

Glow, be the sun in the morning
And show me that you are here.
Take the time to get to know me
And see there's no one else.

Talk.
Won't you say?
Save it for another day?
Come be my light,
The sun in my nighttime.
