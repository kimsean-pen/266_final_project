We choke on the poison wind
Well, these sad eyes can tell the story
Walk along an empire's path
And you said you'd come back again

But you talk to yourself
Believing the fear that drives your greed
When you discover the empty place
A hollow world of instant pleasures

The way you were so disturbed
What's your worth?
What is it you heard?
Try to smile as they devour our youth

With a diamond eye you gaze
At the blackened plains spread out beneath you
When the lights go out you'll see the world
As you have never known it and I talked to myself
Believing that you would come back again
