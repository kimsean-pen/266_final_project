Cast me down where the devil don't go
Devil don't go where I make my home
Cast me down where the devil don't go
Devil don't go where I make my home

Drown my woes in a lake of fire
Sing a song gonna take me higher
Drown my woes in a lake of fire
Sing a song gonna take me higher

Good lord turned his back on me
Lucifer gonna set me free
Good lord turned his back on me
Lucifer gonna set me free

It's a mean world that I've known
Never got no good doing what I'm told
It's a mean world that I've known
Now you'll find me where the devil don't go
Where the devil don't go

Preacher man won't cut no slack
Called my demons but gave them back
Preacher man won't cut no slack
Called my demons but gave them back

Bruised my knees getting down to pray
Warm the pan til my judgement day
Bruised my knees getting down to pray
Warm the pan til my judgement day

It's a mean world that I've known
Never got no good doing what I'm told
It's a mean world that I've known
Now you'll find me where the devil don't go
Where the devil don't go

Cast me down where the devil don't go
Devil don't go where I make my home
Cast me down where the devil don't go
Devil don't go where I make my home

It's a mean world that I've known
Never got no good doing what I'm told
It's a mean world that I've known
Now you'll find me where the devil don't go

It's a mean world that I've known
Never got no good doing what I'm told
It's a mean world that I've known
Now you'll find me where the devil don't go
Where the devil don't go

Cast me down where the devil don't go
Devil don't go where I make my home
Cast me down where the devil don't go
Devil don't go where I make my home
