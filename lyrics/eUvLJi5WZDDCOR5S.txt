Night flakes
Speed freaks
Squeeze into tight place
For god's sake go and try
Prosthesis masquerade
They all compete
Night time exposition
Ooh

Jump up, lay down
Roll around boiling
Make your home in dirt
Let go, over flow
You won't need it
Obligations hurt
Alright

Peel back your face
And make haste
For the underground
Crawl space
Fill up on rubber smoke
Hold it, then choke
Lay back and let go
Ooh
