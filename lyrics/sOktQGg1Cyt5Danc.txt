Waking up, and the bed was made
No one looked me in the eye
The more I try, the more I cry
And it's all for the best

Watched my brother cutting grass outside
Sitting on the porch, he told me
It's a long way to go
Before we can rest
And it's all for the best

(guitar solo)

You're so beautiful it's a sin
On a lonely lazy morning
And when I see you rocking back and forth
Whispering that it's all for the best

One day the storm will roll away
And soon you'll see
You're far away from home but never far away from me
And that's all for the best

(harmonica solo)

And say you love me

Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
and walk away from trouble at the end of the day

Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
and walk away from trouble at the end of the day

Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
and walk away from trouble at the end of the day

Say you love me
Say you love me
Say you love me
Say you love me
Say you love me
Let's just say you love me
