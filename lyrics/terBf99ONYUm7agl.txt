Responsibility, an anchor around my neck
Dependability, made me a nervous wreck
Accountability, I live from check to check
Volatility, neglect and no respect

Got my wheels in motion and I got a path to beat
I hit the road to "I don't know" and look for "tough shit street"

One-way ticket nowhere, there's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again

Moto Psycho - Going nowhere everybody is a Moto Psycho
Move it or lose it, baby
Moto Psycho - Going nowhere 100 miles an hour, Moto Psycho
I'm a Moto Psycho, Moto Psycho

You know you can't resist to tell me what I mean
You gave my mind a twist, said that I was unclean
The actor runs the play and ad-libs in-between
You're all that I resent, my thoughts were so obscene

Got my wheels in motion and I got a path to beat
I hit the road to "I don't know" and look for "tough shit street"

One-way ticket nowhere, there's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again

Moto Psycho - Going nowhere everybody is a Moto Psycho
Move it or lose it, baby
Moto Psycho - Going nowhere 100 miles an hour, Moto Psycho
I'm a Moto Psycho

One-way ticket nowhere, there's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again

Moto Psycho - Going nowhere everybody is a Moto Psycho
Moto Psycho - Going nowhere, move it or lose it, baby, Moto Psycho

(Moto Psycho - Going nowhere 100 miles an hour) Where I'm headed, I don't know
(Moto Psycho) But I'm still off and I hit the road
(Moto Psycho - Going nowhere, I'm a Moto Psycho) Anywhere
(Moto Psycho) I'm going there, I'm going nowhere

(Moto Psycho - Going nowhere)
(Everybody is a Moto Psycho) Time and time and time again
(Move it or lose it, baby) I'm a Moto Psycho
(Moto Psycho - Going nowhere 100 miles an hour, Moto Psycho)
