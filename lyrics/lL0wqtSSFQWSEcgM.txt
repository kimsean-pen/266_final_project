Drink slow to feed the nose, you know he likes to get blown
Has he got enough money to spend?
Leave? No, he's to and fro, he doesn't like it when the girls go
Has he got enough money to spend?

It's goin' off 'cos they're not gonna let him in
Two and a half, the boy is rushing out his skin
He's got his charm with the girls that are smoking
He takes her arm, jumps the bar and now he's in

Drink slow to feed the nose, you know he likes to get blown
Has he got enough money to spend?
Leave? No, he's to and fro, he doesn't like it when the girls go
Has he got enough money to spend?

A broken half a glass has opened up his chin
He thinks he's hard, a powdered mouth that tastes of gin
He's just been barred for that blues he was smoking
And then he barks, "It's my car, I'm sleepin' in"

Tabs with unlimited O's, new clothes, bloody nose
Powders and walkin' back home
Has he got enough weed? No
Broken phone, retchin' on the floor alone
I can't believe that we're talkin' 'bout him

"I'm searching' you mate, your jaw's all over the place"
Can't talk, quick slap in the face
Yes, I threw a nut, but your friends a case
Why you singlin' him out, is it because of his race?
"Look, the dog won't bark if you don't lark about"

M-O-N-E-Y's me
M-O-N-E-Y
M-O-N-E-Y's me
