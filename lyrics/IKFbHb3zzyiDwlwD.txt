Hooooooooooo
This is DJ Crash-Crash
and you're on the air here at WDRD
we are here once again talking a bout our favorite fugitive,
Cindy Mayweather
Electric lady #1
Caller, you are on the air

Hello, my name is Peggy Lakeshore, and I live in Neon Valley
I just wanna say I'm disappointed
You're disappointed?
Disgusted actually
Really?
Yeah this whole thing
Really.
I mean they should just do whatever they do to people like that
People like that, what does that mean?
I mean she's just not even a person
Sh- she's not a person
She's a droid, just like all of you
Well you're right she's not a person,
she is a droid, she is an android,
an Alpha-Platinum 9000,
and she is jamming

Next caller, you're on the air
HEH, dude I wanna say power up dude,
power up
power up
Mhm, power up to you
Okay, I'm a student at Time University, okay,
and my name is Josh,
and I've been following you, and Cyber Soul, and the whole droid,
um, um, Wonderground for a little while now
and I just wanna know if you know, uh,
if you guys in the android community truly believe
that Cindy Mayweather is, you know, not just, like,
Electric Lady #1 and all,
but, like, also the ArchAndroid --
OH NO NO NO, NOT ON MY SHOW

Next caller, you're on the air!
Robot Love is queer
Wha-what what
Robot Love is queer
Quee- what, OH
Anything else?
That's all
I see, well what I wanna know is how you know it's queer,
if you haven't tried it.
HOOOOOOOOOO.

Here we are on WDRD, Metropolis 105.5
we still alive,
everybody say BAAAAYBEH
