No I'm not your only doubt, must be another
A time I want to never forget, you feed the hunger
But you don't make it easy,
break through your cracks enough to drown me
You don't want to see me make it all back and so I lose you then

Help me say I love you
I love you playing, I love you playing the game
I'm still yours to give away
If I was a...
Scratch your name, pretending it's the end
And I'm trying to forget your name
Come on take a walk
Confused to win but you play to land in vain
Well I'll forget all the nights and days
Tell me all is well
A wasted plan, your mind expands again
'Cause I know it's true you're losing me

Close, too cold, it's hard to tell if there's emotion
Diving over everything with the devotion
But we would breeze through the
days, placing our hands under the shadows
We collapse in a haze, talk out of place, then simply shallow

Help me say I love you
I love you playing, I love you playing the game
I'm still yours to give away
If I was a...
Scratch your name, pretending it's the end
And I'm trying to forget your name
Come on take a walk
Confused to win but you play to land in vain
Well I'll forget all the nights and days
Tell me all is well
A wasted plan, your mind expands again
'Cause I know it's true you're losing me

I believe you were the one to leave me
I'm through, why do we look bad to look at the truth
Don't forget, you were the one who gets confused
Why do we look bad to look

Help me say I love you
I love you playing, I love you playing the game
I'm still yours to give away
If I was a...
Scratch your name, pretending it's the end
And I'm trying to forget your name
Come on take a walk
Confused to win but you play to land in vain
Well I'll forget all the nights and days
Tell me all is well
A wasted plan, your mind expands again
'Cause I know it's true you're losing me
