All I know
All I know
All I, all I
Look (groovy, heavier)

All I know is money right now
All I know is money right now
All I know is your booty in that tight dress, nice legs
Friday night, shit is lookin' lovely right now
I know nothin' 'bout that fake shit, nothin' 'bout that fake shit
I know nothin' 'bout actin' brand new to my crew
Yeah, it's all about the fam and the homies I came up with, yeah yeah

All I know is positive vibes, no negative shit
Thank God I'm alive, I inspire the kids
Yeah my whip is foreign, and my chick be callin'
And you know I stay fly so my kicks be soarin', oh yeah
Let me flex one time, just one time
Alright I'm over that shit, yeah I'm over that shit
Yeah look at the way I move, man they know what it is

What my purpose is, what my purpose is
A few mill, cool for now, 'cause I worked for this
But in time, wanna be up in your mind
Redefine how you lookin' at the world and the way that shit is, ah yeah
I'ma be the one, I'ma be the one
Watch me, don't worry I got this, look

Yeah, all I know is this fuckin' money
We made nothin' into something
One thing I do know for sure is I'ma be the one, yeah
Don't worry I got this
Don't worry I
Don't worry I
Don't worry I
Don't worry I got this
Don't worry I
Don't worry I
Don't worry I (look)

If you don't know, you about to find out
I mean every word out of my mouth
Workin' too hard to be underappreciated
I'm the same one even back when they were hatin'
Move after move, motherfucker, is what we be makin'
Everyday is our birthday and we be cakin', cakin' (look)

But some see the vision now and they try to creep around
But I ain't worried one bit
'Cause my mama wake up every morning, she be praying for me now
Look, my family too big to take any days off
So we grindin' like tommorow is uncertain
'Cause the future isn't somethin' you can purchase
So we showin' out till they close the curtains

At times I wanna press rewind to a much simpler time, oh no
It's AOMG for life, yeah I'm always on my grind, oh no
Pickin' the other side, that's like suicide, oh no
But we about to let 'em all know, motherfucker let's go, ooh!

Yeah, all I know is this fuckin' money
We made nothin' into something
One thing I do know for sure is I'ma be the one, yeah
Don't worry I got this
Don't worry I
Don't worry I
Don't worry I
Don't worry I got this
Don't worry I
Don't worry I
Don't worry I

All I know
All I know
All I, all I
