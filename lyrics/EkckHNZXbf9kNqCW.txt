What kind of man
What kind of man am I?
I try to walk where I just fell
I try to break a secret spell
In your eyes I feel the flames of love

Flames of love
Flames of love
I'm drowning in the sea of love
And enough is never enough
When I find myself
Deep in your eyes
Over and over again

Flames of love
What kind of fool
What kind of fool am I?
I look for shadows in the sun
And memories of days to come

In your eyes I feel the flames of love
Flames of love
Flames of love
I'm drowning in the sea of love
And enough is never enough
When I find myself

Deep in your eyes
Over and over again
Flames of love
I surrender to sleep dead in your arms

In a wave of lust for live
You touch me so deep
I cry out
Mountain in a flames of love
Flames of love
Flames of love
I'm drowning in the sea of love
And enough is never enough
When I find myself
Deep in your eyes
Over and over again
Flames of love
