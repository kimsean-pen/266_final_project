And I know it sounds better when
The right words sticking me down
And you respect what I'm doing
But you just can't stand me now
And I'll stop the screaming if
You put something in my mouth
My mouth

My mouth is dry for you
You paint a pretty picture,
I'll put my fist right through
My words are turning circles
In the back of you
And I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe

And you stay up forever just
Praying your love won't last
But you pop up whenever
My head's sliding off to love
And I push past the others to see you,
Come match my stride
My stride

My stride is wide for you
Push on through my heels,
Propel me faster still
Say that I'm a nightmare,
What does that make you?
And I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could

On my way, I'm on way
All that looking caught me off
My gaze is strong and straight
But my mind's half glazed
You get upset over my trips, have been full
My trips, have been full
My trips, have been full
My trips, have been full

And I know it sounds better when
The right words sticking me down
And you respect what I'm doing but
You just can't stand me now
And I'll stop the screaming if
You put something in my mouth
My mouth

My mouth is dry for you
You paint a pretty picture,
I'll put my fist right through
My words are turning circles
In the back of you
And I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe

I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe

I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe
I did the best that I could, babe
