Verse:

There are three new movies op'ning tonight,
A baseball game, a championship fight,
A big band concert under the stars,
And a rodeo, Midget racing cars,
For some gals and gents the above events
hold their own vicarious charms,
But I'd rather go to a place I know,
Where I can hold you in my arms!

Chorus:

Hey there cutes, put on your dancin' boots and come dance with me,
Come dance with me, what an evening for some terpsichore.
Pretty face, I know a swingin' place, so come dance with me,
Romance with me on a crowded floor.

And while the rhythm swings, what lovely things I'll be sayin',
For what is dancing but making love set to music, playin'.

When the band begin to leave the stand and folks start to roam,
As we wing home, cheek to cheek we'll be,
Come on, come on, come on, come on and dance with me

(Repeat, but instead substitute the following words line 1:
dancin/Basie, line 5: lovely/cuckoo, line 8: wing/waltz and the first
3 "come on"'s in the last line are repeated.)
