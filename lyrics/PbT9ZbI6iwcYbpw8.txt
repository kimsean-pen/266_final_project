Gemini – twin of two extremes
Symmetry – polarized at the seam
The side of dirt – an animal ignited
The side of the vacuum – existing in psychic
"Flesh is just mud, until tempered with fire
Heaving balance, a dimension of fibers"
Summoning energy, twins of darkness and light
Grey equation, charged with blackness beyond nights
"Soil, water, light – temples of the flesh which channel seas of urge."
Gemini – twin of two extremes
Symmetry – polarized at the seam
