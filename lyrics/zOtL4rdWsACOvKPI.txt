The foggy air around us was blinding,
The foggy sea was loud behind it.
It's foggy breath breathed it's water into our lungs,
And we curled up around it,
And we were deafened by the sound
Of foggy waves crash,
It's still ringing in my ears.
But my ears and lungs are nothing
Compared to my eyes,
I saw something in the sand
That swept me off my feet.
Oh! The Blow!
And rising back in misty wave throws,
Forever churning up it's boiling strength.
And with the faster that the car flies,
Stick your head out of the window,
And feel it beating hard and sweet into your face!
And in a moment when the time slows,
The air gets so wide and thick and fuels a force
That blows a whole right through the chest.
Oh! The Blow!
