Every time I'm fallin' down
You take the repercussions
Headaches and anxiety
Advancing my frustrations

Rushing's of my depression
Sacrifice everythin'
Waste with me into nothin'
Well now you're stuck with me
Stuck with me
Stuck with me

Oh, hand up your soul to my wrist
And I'll vow my trust to you
Movin' here I always thought
I realized you've imagined

Rushing's of my depression
Sacrifice everythin'
Waste with me into nothin'
Well now you're stuck with me
Stuck with me
Stuck with me

Rushing's of my depression
Sacrifice everythin'
Waste with me into nothin'
Well now you're stuck with me
Stuck with me
Stuck with me
