Look around you, do you see what you've got?
With something so beautiful
Afraid it would drop into a thousand regrets
And I bet you were left there

It's getting me down and I can't understand
Why everyone stares when I crash at the landing
And around where they stand
Everyone talks again

We try to say with confidence
That we're picking up oblivion
And I was tryin' to make some sense
Speaking to you

We try to say with confidence
That we're picking up oblivion
Inside of you

All around you there's a feeling you lost
That everything beautiful is not what it was
Whenever you were on top
Of all you left up there

It's getting me down to the place that I land
That hits me so hard
With a cruel understanding that it might be the end
Everyone talks again

We try to say with confidence
That we're picking up oblivion
And I was tryin' to make some sense
Speaking to you

We try to say with confidence
That we're picking up oblivion
Inside of you
Inside of you

I'll bury myself into the corner
I can't even tell if I won't see you anymore
I'll bury myself into the corner
I can't even tell if I won't see you anymore
I'll bury myself into the corner
