Airborne pathogens
a contorting carcinoma multiplies without end
invasive genophagia, irreversible damage
dismantling and reassembling their nucleic acid

shambling eldritch beast, a mindless vector of disease
the brain erodes, flesh calcifies, controlled by endoparasites
Your mind and body are not your own, play host to hostile lifeforms
Unseen, explosive haze, with every breath you become their slave

This world was never yours to begin with
and nor will it be in the end

As you devour, so shall you be
this plague never replete
Against this foe there is no victory
self-destruction written in the genes

The wilderness reclaims these empty streets
history is forgotten
once thriving metropolises now mortuaries
derelict, old and rotten

Their cradle is our grave, new life born of decay

We prosper from their ruin
As our progeny lament, we will not be forgiven
The storm on the horizon writes their names in the sky
as we gamble the future on the roll of a dice
