Now when you climb
Into your bed tonight
And when you lock
And bolt the door
Just think of those
Out in the cold and dark
'Cause there's not enought love to go 'round.
And sympathy

Is what we need, my friend
And sympathy
Is what we need
And sympathy
Is what we need, my friend
'Cause there's not enough love to go 'round
No, there's not enough love to go 'round.
Now half the world

Hates the other half
And half the world
Has all the food
And half the world
Lies down and quietly starves
'Cause there's not enough love to go 'round.
And sympathy

Is what we need, my friend
And sympathy
Is what we need
And sympathy
Is what we need, my friend
'Cause there's not enough love to go 'round
No, there's not enough love to go 'round.
