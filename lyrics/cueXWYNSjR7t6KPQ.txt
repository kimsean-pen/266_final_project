Where's the music?!
-My laptop died!
Ha-ha!

Press play, walk away
I'm your laptop DJ
I don't know how to mix
So I just click on sync
Please don't cheer too loud for me
It will go to my head
And if the music stops
It means the battery's dead
Press Play
Turn the knobs
Pump your fist
Pretend you're cool, you can't resist
Where's the music?!
