take my hand,
hurray for the winters come...
cease my plans
excuse me from the scenes of old

i can meet you there?, i just don't care
on this new years day
with no celebration from me

understand
there's comfort with the wealth of gold
increase demands
release me from the scenes of old

i can't make it clear you just won't hear
on this new years day
there's no celebration from me

i could see you there?, we just don't care
on this new years day
without hesitation
there's no celebration from me
