Drivin' faster in my car
Falling farther, from just what we are
Smoke a cigarette, and lie some more, these conversations kill
Falling faster in my car
Time to take her home, her dizzy head is conscience laden

Time to take a ride, it leaves today, no conversation
Time to take her home, her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to wait too long, to wait too long, to wait too long

Too much walkin', shoes worn thin
Too much trippin', and my soul's worn thin
Time to catch a ride, it leaves today, her name is what it means
Too much walkin', shoe's worn thin
Time to take her home, her dizzy head is conscience laden

Time to take a ride, it leaves today, no conversation
Time to take her home, her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to wait too long, to wait too long, to wait too long

Conversations kill
Conversations kill
Conversations kill

Time to take her home, her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to take a ride, it leaves today, no conversation
Time to take her home, her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to wait too long, to wait too long, to wait too long

Conversations kill
Conversations kill
Conversations kill
