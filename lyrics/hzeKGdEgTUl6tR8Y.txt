Come lay down in the water
We're all sons and daughters
Rest your head on the alter
We're all, come lay down in the water

Pirouette, single step
Won't you spin me around the room like a marionette?
Lonely maestro, spin me real slow
Oh, I just need something to get me through the thick of it

I have everything from time to time
I have everything from time to time

Come lay down in the water
We're all sons and daughters
Rest your head on the alter
We're all, come lay down in the water

These silent offerings that only cowards sing
Oh darling, I was never free for the taking
We had everything from time to time
Yeah, we had everything, we have everything

Come lay down in the water
We're all sons and daughters
Rest your head by the water
Oh, come lay down in the water

Yeah, we had everything

Come lay down in the water
We're all sons and daughters
In the water
Rest your head by the water

Yeah, we had everything
Oh, come lay down in the water
We had everything
Come lay down, rest your head
Come lay down
