Wake up, love, there's eerie sounds
Something from the sky is coming down
And now the panic has begun
As everything becomes undone
But there is nowhere
No, there is nowhere to run

I don't know if we'll be okay
No measure
Having a gun or a hand grenade
Won't matter
If it's drones you're dead
Is what we are

Having a laugh at the fairground
When you felt the earth shake all around
And it's a violent world to see
And a recycling of history
Where there is no room
No, there is no room to breathe

I don't know if we'll be okay
No measure
Having a gun or a hand grenade
Won't matter
If it's drones you're dead
Is what we are

Turning left, turning right
Now the other way
Trying to find a way to break through
When all is lost I hope you know
If you were gone I'd miss you

I don't know if we'll be okay
Is it a home or is it a grave
I don't know if we'll be okay
Having a gun or a hand grenade
Won't matter
If it's drones you're dead

If it's drones you're dead
