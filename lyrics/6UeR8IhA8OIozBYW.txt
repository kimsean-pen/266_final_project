I am a message prescient forecasting
There is a limit so take my temperature
You say "your turn" but I think the invite's open to all
So come on take your medicine
Hey doctor heal yourself or do you got too much to lose
You are a message precious extracting forging a tactic
To get your motion through
You say "don't know not sure"
But i think no holster's empty for you
So come on take your medicine
Hey doctor heal yourself
Or do you got too much to lose
Shoot out and shoot out the window
