Does the sun shine on you everyday
Wherever you are
Remember California
The things that we'd say
How special you are
And when you're sad, sad, sad
Does anyone listen?
Do you feel like a diamond?
I hope you feel like a million

Just forget the ones who let you go
Forget the ones too scared to know you

I'll be waiting here to show you how to come back home
Somethings never change
Like the way I say "I love you"
And even when you still need time to grow
If that's the only way you'll know
That somethings never change
Like the way I say "I love you"

I hope it's summertime wherever you are
You're under the stars
Don't forget California
She's always there waiting for you
And when it gets bad, bad, bad
When life just gets so heavy
Remember that you're happy
Don't forget to take it easy

And forget the ones who let you go
Forget those ones, yeah they don't know you

I'll be waiting here to show you how to come back home
Somethings never change
Like the way I say "I love you"
And even when you still need time to grow
If that's the only way you'll know
That somethings never change
Like the way I say "I love you"

And I watch you come and go
Yeah, these changing tides are
all I've ever really known I've told you
And you ride the roughs unknown
But one thing you can always count on
I will always love you
I'll spend my lifetime trying to show you

I'll be waiting here to show you how to come back home
Somethings never change
Like the way I say "I love you"
And even when you still need time to grow
If that's the only way you'll know
That somethings never change
Like the way I say "I love you"

Right through this I know moments
Rough starts come and go
Right through this I know moments
Rough starts come and go
