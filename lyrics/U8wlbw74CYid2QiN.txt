Ain't scared of nothing
Maybe I should be
Think that we should kill some time
Up at Byron Creek
You ain't scared of nothing?
Let's wait and see
Laughing and singing
It's the only way
Took a swig of God knows what
And swung up to the ledge
You looked down the belly
Hanging by a thread
Ain't scared of nothing
Am i the only one?
Baby, if you ain't that brave
What is it you want?
You recoiled quickly
As if i had a gun
I would watch you walk along the canal
Wearing ribbons of gold morning light
And you were looking through me into the pale
Over the hills, biding time
Ain't scared of nothing
Though i'm afraid
You're going to need to break that trust
And then i'll keep you safe
And there won't be no trouble
As long as you pay
Yeah, ain't scared of nothing
Let's take a piece of chalk
Think that we should draw a line
That we never cross
And we'll turn all the lights out
And we can look the lock
I would watch you walk along the canal
Wearing ribbons of gold morning light
You were looking through me into the pale
Over the hills, biding time
I ain't scared of nothing
And i won't ever be
Don't matter who you are
I ain't got what you need
Because a man scared of nothing
Don't have anything
