Their hair-dos are always weird
Very haunting, will see them in dreams
They're back from the grave
To the ghosts, let's send the sign of "LOVE"
Oh, let's make some noise, you, me and all
Too rad, yourself
Get thrown in, let it roll
Wanna dedicate this to you, this skull
He's gonna mess with it, "Jackson Head"
Got some conditioner, and is still exploding
Too rad, yourself
Their hair-dos are always weird
Very haunting, will see them in dreams... will see them
"Jackson Head"
