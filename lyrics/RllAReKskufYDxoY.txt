Got the mike in my hand but can I make you understand?
That a-hole bands have a-hole fans
Bloodhound's the name and the gang's to blame
Like Chan n' Chin the Siamese twins it's one in the same
So fame ain't gonna live forever
Never worrying about dying cause it can't be any better
But whatever happens to happen always happens for the worst
And if the worst is yet to happen I hope it happens to you first
So hello Joe, what do you know?
Heard ya just got back from a Bloodhound show
Did you do the Batussi or did you do the Hustle?
Did you do the Flamin' Waffle or the Super Bowl Shuffle?
No matter what you did, you're gonna be amused
If you were not entertained you did not drink enough booze
If ya get your eyes a fuzzin' then we'll get your ears a buzzin'
'Cause we play around the world, you play around with your cousin
