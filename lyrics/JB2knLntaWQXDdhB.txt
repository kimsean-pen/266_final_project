Here I sit in paradise
My head between my hands
Little sister, break your vow
Break down, the sacred side
Little sister, break the rules
Break me in two

Will hopes ever fill your eyes?
Look before I sleep tonight
Little sister, now you're gone
Let's just say it's a mercy kill
But little sister, you've left me
Howling at the moon
If you touched my heart
You might be surprised
You'd be paralyzed
If you touched my heart
A truth might lie disguised
You'd be paralyzed

Just once little sister
Just once little sister
