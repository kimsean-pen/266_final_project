No, no, no, no, don't phunk with my heart
Yeah
No, no, no, no, don't phunk with my heart

I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby (love, love)
In love baby (love, love)
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby (love, love)
In love baby (love, love)

Girl, you know you got me, got me
With your pistol shot me, shot me
And I'm here helplessly
In love and nothing can stop me
It can't stop me once I started
Can't return me once you bought it
I'm coming baby, don't got it (don't make me wait)
So let's be about it

No, no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart

Baby, have some trustin', trustin'
When I come in lustin', lustin'
Cause I'll bring you that comfort
I ain't only here cause I want your
Body, I want your mind too
Interestin's what I find you
And I'm interested in the long haul
Come on girl (yee-haw)

I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby (love, love)
In love baby (love, love)
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby (love, love)
In love baby (love, love)

No, no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart

Girl, you had me, once you kissed me
My love for you is not iffy
I always want you wit me
I'll play Bobby and you'll play Whitney (all long)
If you smoke, I smoke too
That's how much I'm in love wit chu
Crazy is what crazy do
Crazy in love, I'm a crazy fool

No, no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart

Why are you so in-sa-cure?
When you got passionate love hurr?
You always claimin' I'm a cheater
Think I'll up and go leave ya
For another se√±orita
You forgot that I need ya
You must have caught amnesia
That's why you don't believe wha
Wha'- yeah - check it out
