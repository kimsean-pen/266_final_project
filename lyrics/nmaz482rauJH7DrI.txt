Lay where you're laying
Don't make a sound
I know they're watching
They're watching

All the commotion
The kiddie like play
Has people talking
They're talking

You, your sex is on fire

Dark of the alley
The breaking of day
Head while I'm driving
I'm driving

Soft lips are open
Them knuckles are pale
Feels like you're dying
You're dying

You, your sex is on fire
Consumed with the what's to transpire

Hot as a fever
Rattling bones
I could just taste it
Taste it

But it's not forever
But it's just tonight
Oh we're still the greatest
The greatest
The greatest

You, your sex is on fire
You, your sex is on fire

Consumed with the what's to transpire

And you
Your sex is on fire
Consumed with the what's to transpire
