Worthless without time
We follow how it flies by
We still keep believing
In wide and comforting lies
When it's our turn
Together we stay stronger
We lay still and silent and watch how hour burns for eternity

You carry me away
Tomorrow we're unbreakable
I hold my breath and wait
This moment is unbreakable
I can feel it deep within my heart and my soul - you make me whole
I want to live this second forever, always together, forevermore
I hold my breath and wait

Worthless without life
We see how years keep flying by
I never really cared until I opened my eyes
The final day awaits
And the firestorms getting closer
Under falling stars we will seal our fate for eternity

You carry me away
Tomorrow we're unbreakable
I hold my breath and wait
This moment is unbreakable
I can feel it deep within my heart and my soul - you make me whole
I want to live this second forever, always together, forevermore
I hold my breath and wait till the end
until'marrow we're unbreakable

You carry me away
Tomorrow we're unbreakable
I hold my breath and wait
This moment is unbreakable
And I can feel it deep within my heart and my soul - you make me whole
I want to live this second forever, always together, forevermore
We are stronger than ever, always together, forevermore
We are stronger than ever, always together, forevermore
I hold my breath and wait till the end
until'marrow we're unbreakable
