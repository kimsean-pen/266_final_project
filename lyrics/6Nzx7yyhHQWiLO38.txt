Coal and flame
Melting those ice hands
An air of mixed feelings
Beneath fallen ceilings

Seal the gates
Before what's out is in
Or offer a treaty
A chance for reprieve

Just let these tunnels cave
Just let this fire fade

Maybe the sky'll break
We're just a lie away
From proving to ourselves we're not afraid

And now
These silver screens
These scripted dreams

And now,
We're suddenly
Fates latest casualties
