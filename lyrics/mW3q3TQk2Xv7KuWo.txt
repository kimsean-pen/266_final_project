You were talking and I thought I heard you say
"Please, leave me alone
Nothing in this world can make me stay
I'd rather go back, I'd rather go back home"

But if you believed in me
Like I believe in you
We could have a love so true
We would go on endlessly

And I know anyday, anyday
I will see you smile
Anyway, anyway
Only for a little while

Well, someday baby, I know you're gonna need me
When this whole world has got you down
I'll be right here so woman, call me
And I'll never ever let you down

But if you believed in me
Like I believe in you
We could have a love so true
We would go on endlessly

And I know anyday, anyday
I will see you smile
Anyway, anyway, just for a little while
Only for a little while

And I know anyday, anyday
I will see you smile, I will see you smile
Anyway, anyway
Only for a little while

Break the glass and twist the knife into yourself
You've got to be a fool to understand
To bring your woman back home after she's left you for another
You've got to be a, you've got to be a man, you've got to be a man

But if you believed in me
Like I believe in you
We could have a love so true
We would go on endlessly

And I know anyday, anyday
I will see you smile
Anyway, anyway, just for a little while
Only for a little while

Anyday, anyday
I will see you, I will see you smile
Anyway, anyway
[Incomprehensible]

Anyday, anyday
I will see you smile
[Incomprehensible]
Anyway, anyway, just for a little
Just for a little while
