If you want to turn me onto
Anything you really want to
Turn me onto your love, your love

If the nighttime is the right time
Anytime of yours is my time
We can find time for love, sweet love

Come on, sweet Caroline
You're my sweet Caroline
You know I wanna take you
I've really got to make you
Come on, sweet Caroline
Take my hand, together we can rock 'n' roll

When I'm thinking of you sleeping
I'm at home alone and weeping
Are you keeping your love, sweet love?

Do you still care when I'm not there?
Do you really wish I was there?
Can I come there for love, sweet love?

Come on, sweet Caroline
You're my sweet Caroline
You know I wanna take you
I've really got to make you
Come on, sweet Caroline
Take my hand, together we can rock 'n' roll

If you want to turn me onto
Anything you really want to
Turn me onto your love, your love

Come on, sweet Caroline
You're my sweet Caroline
You know I wanna take you
I've really got to make you
Come on, sweet Caroline
Take my hand, together we can rock 'n' roll
