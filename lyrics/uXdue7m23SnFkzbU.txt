You will never be alright
And I will never be okay
And I can't be your Jesus Christ
'Cause I am but a mortal man, just looking for the promised land

And it kills me slowly
You never know what you got till it's gone forever
My one and only
It's time to say goodbye

When life gets hard, I send a prayer
For this cross I have to bear and this smile I'm forced to wear
And I'm no good, no good, can't you tell?
And if you could cast a spell, would it be to watch me fail? Well, I prevail
I prevail

You will never see the light
Heaven will not know your name
And my only real advice is
The only thing that you ignore is exactly what you're looking for

So listen closely
You never know what you got till it's gone forever
My one and only
It's time to say goodbye

When life gets hard, I send a prayer
For this cross I have to bear and this smile I'm forced to wear
And I'm no good, no good, can't you tell?
And if you could cast a spell, would it be to watch me fail?

Oh, when life gets hard, I send a prayer
For this cross I have to bear and this smile I'm forced to wear
And I'm no good, no good, can't you tell?
Oh, if I could cast a spell, I would send you straight to hell
And if you could cast a spell, would it be to watch me fail?
