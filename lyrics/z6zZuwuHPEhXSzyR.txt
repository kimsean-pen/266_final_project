Break the hands on every clock
So we can take our time
Make the most of every minute
So that I can make you mine
Tell your friends you're staying in tonight
Can't get you out of my head
Take it slow so we can do this right
If that's what you want, then I'll beg

Don't you know we can do anything
If you feel it too, then girl don't be ashamed
Don't you know we can do everything
If you just let me lay you down

Cold nights, closed eyes
Feel your body light the fire in mine
Turn out the lights and I won't lie
I've got sinning on my mind
Same scene, repeats
My thoughts tangled underneath these sheets
Turn out the lights and I won't lie
I've got sinning on my mind

Morning comes and it's usually over
But you are by my side
Not sure if it gets any closer
For once it feels right

Don't you know we can do anything
If you feel it too, then girl don't be ashamed
Don't you know we can do everything
If you just let me lay you down

Cold nights, closed eyes
Feel your body light the fire in mine
Turn out the lights and I won't lie
I've got sinning on my mind
Same scene, repeats
My thoughts tangled underneath these sheets
Turn out the lights and I won't lie

I never saw myself catching these feelings
I never asked for help or needed the healing
I can't choose the cards that I'm dealt
I can't stop the way that this felt
It keeps coming around and round
And round and back again

I never saw myself catching these feelings
I never asked for help or needed the healing
I can't choose the cards that I'm dealt
I can't stop the way that I felt
It keeps coming around and round
And round and back again, oh

Cold nights, closed eyes
Feel your body light the fire in mine
Turn out the lights and I won't lie
I've got sinning on my mind
Same scene, repeats
My thoughts tangled underneath these sheets
Turn out the lights and I won't lie
I've got sinning on my mind
