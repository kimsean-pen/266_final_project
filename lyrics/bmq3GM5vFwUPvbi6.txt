Na na-na-na na na-na-na na na-na-na
Na na-na-na na na-na-na na na-na-na
It's the perfect night
To go out and do it right
One look into your eyes
Sets the emotion
Don't need psychology
With this biology
Officialty is ever flowing
All I really wanna do is love
Get into the rhythm of the two of us
I feel I can't get enough together
I feel the chemistry
Between you and me
There's electricity
When you're touching me
I feel the chemistry
Feel the biogravity
I want you touching me
I feel you touching me
The way my body acts
When your body moves like that
It's science in control
And we're the best lads
It's in the D.N.A.
No we build a tray
So let the music play
With least attention
All I really wanna do is love
Get into the rhythm of the two of us
I feel I can't get enough together
I feel the chemistry
Between you and me
There's electricity
When you're touching me
I feel the chemistry
Feel the biogravity
I want you touching me
I feel you touching me
I feel you touching me
Chemistry
I want you touching me
Chemistry
I feel you touching me
Na na-na-na na na-na-na na na-na-na
Na na-na-na na na-na-na na na-na-na
Na na-na-na na na-na-na na na-na-na
Na na-na-na na na-na-na na na-na-na
Na na-na-na na na-na-na na na-na-na
I feel the chemistry
Between you and me
There's electricity
When you're touching me
I feel the chemistry
Feel the biogravity
I want you touching me
I feel you touching me
