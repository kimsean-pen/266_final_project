Fly firefly

When I said go I never meant away
You ought to know the freaky games we play
Could you forgive and learn how to forget
Hear me as I'm calling out your name

Firefly come back to me
Make the night as bright as day
I'll be looking out for you
Tell me that your lonely too

Firefly come lead me on
Follow you into the sun
That's the way it ought to be
Firefly come back to me
Fly firefly

You and me we shared a mystery
We were so close like honey to the bee
And if you tell me how to make you understand
I'm minor in a major kinda way

Firefly come back to me
Make the night as bright as day
I'll be looking out for you
Tell me that your lonely too

Firefly come lead me on
Follow you into the sun
That's the way it ought to be
Firefly come back to me

Fly firefly through the sky
Come and play with my desire
Don't be long don't ask why
I can't wait another night

Fly firefly through the sky
Wait another night
Don't be long
Fire fire firefly

Firefly come back to me
Make the night as bright as day
I'll be looking out for you
Tell me that your lonely too

Firefly come lead me on
Follow you into the sun
That's the way it ought to be
Firefly come back
Firefly come back to me
Make the night as bright as day
I'll be looking out for you
Tell me that your lonely too
Firefly come lead me on
Follow you into the sun
That's the way it ought to be
Firefly come back to me
