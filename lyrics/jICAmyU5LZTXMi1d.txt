I don't know what i'm doing
I think my life's gone to waste
I can't stop taking drugs
And feeling sad about this place
My friends all in the north coast
Worst part's that i havent's faced
That now i'm all alone
And i cannot escape
What will i do?
When the sun goes down
When the flowers are grown
When the winter is gone
What will i do?
When i see you again
When i don't have tears left
When i have your eyes in front of mine
I'm overwhelmed with the pain
I might not see you again
Everybody wants the key to happiness
