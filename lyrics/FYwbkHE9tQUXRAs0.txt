Now your bowl is empty
And your feet are cold
And your body cannot stop rocking
I know it hurts to let go

Since the day we found you
You have been a friend
And your voice still echoes
In the hallways of this house
And now it's the end

We will be with you
When you're leaving
We will be with you
When you go
We will be with you
And hold you till you're quiet
It hurts to let you go
(We will be with you)
No
(We will be with you)
Oh
(We will be with you)
No
(You will stay with us)
