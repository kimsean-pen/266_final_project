Simple souls overload as I explode the data banks
'Cause the earth and space gave birth to this paleface
Supreme, linguistic, mental machine
My brain cells swell, the intellects extreme

Fire fills my veins as I proclaim my resistance
To the mind-swapping parasites that feed off my existence
As I, skin the burn to relearn the royal plan
Out beyond the edges in the depths of spirit land

It's authentic, apocalyptic destroyer
Damaging challengers, resurrection, disorder
A monument of crisis, I strikes this, you're dead
Line my nest with your soul, cleansed in bloodshed

Battle ready!
Poets gonna take control
Battle ready!
Souls violate parole
Battle ready!
Violently invade your home
Breaking the bone of those who 'pose

Commanding the mic, striking up a verb-fest
Mass destruction is my function, time to put it to the test
In combat, attacking since way back
In the days I drew praise for the way that I slayed facts

Formulating flows in revolutionary science
It's the catastrophic prophet from the anarchist alliance
Freaking techniques, this creature of speech
We feel the fury of devastation 'cause we tasted defeat

I'm alone on my throne in this universe of fear
Royalty divides my soul, in this role I'm revered
As the pinnacle lyrical master, queen of disaster
I ruin brain fluid the unknown is what I'm after!

Battle ready!
Battle ready!
I'm breaking the bone of those who 'pose

Battle ready!
Poets gonna take control
Battle ready!
Souls violate parole
Battle ready!
Violently invade your home
Breaking the bone of those who 'pose

Shaking up the world, just like the second coming of christ
When I write, thrice divine with this goddess sight
Words will flow, wounds will grow
You know, bones will be exposed from the force that I unload

It's the soul eater! Mic bleeder with the voice of chaos
I got the nectar of the gods flowing from my mental pod
Gather the flock, alarm your block
Tell them the shepherds have come and got the keys to unlock

A holy war, through your veins it courses
More lyrical artillery than the armed forces
Supernatural, styles be volatile
It's the mind manipulator, the war child!

Battle ready!
Poets gonna take control
Battle ready!
Souls violate parole
Battle ready!
Violently invade your home
Breaking the bone of those who 'pose

Come!
Shadow soldiers!

We came to defy, living life as a lie
We embryonic satellites need our freedom to fly
To watch you die! Agonizing cries are heard in stereo
I'm visualizing battlefield scenarios

In the line of fire, watching empires fall
Into attack position, eliminate them all!

My species!

Battle ready!
Battle ready!
Battle ready!
Breaking the bone of those who 'pose

Battle ready!
Poets gonna take control
Battle ready!
Souls violate parole
Battle ready!
Violently invade your home
Breaking the bone of those who 'pose

My species!
My species!
No surrender!
No surrender!
