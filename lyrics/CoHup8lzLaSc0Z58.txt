Awake
In an
Ocean
Of memories
It's rise
In me
Is sudden
Forced to confront
Drowning
In these
Impressions
Its coming back
So real
So near
So sad
Nothing left

In pleasant cages
Through adolescence
We're out of time
It's closing in
These walls are growing higher and we're
Running out of time

It had
Always
Been there
A blessing and a curse
Certain
Mistrusts
Alludes
We are powerless

The fire broke out
We were running in the night
The air was thick with anguish
Fear in all its might
Profanity they yelled
At this cry for justice
And as the walls began to crack
They launched the guns at their sons heads
