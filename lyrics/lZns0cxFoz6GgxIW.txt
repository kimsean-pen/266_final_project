If I stay with you
If I'm choosing wrong
I don't care at all
If I'm losing now
But I'm winning late
That's all I want
Now we need some space
'Cause I feel for you
And I wanna change
Growing up alone, it seems so short
I can't explain
Whatever happens in the future
Trust in destiny
Don't try to make anything else
Even when you feel
I don't care at all
I am lost
I don't care at all
Lost my time, my life is going on
I will be so strong
Looking for a new version of myself
'Cause now all I want is to be a part
Of my new world
Whatever happens in the future
Trust in destiny
Don't try to make anything else
Even when you feel
I don't care at all
I am lost
I don't care at all
Why not have it all?
I am lost
I don't care at all
Lost my time, my life is going on
