Go without
'Til the need seeps in
You're low, anymore
Collect your novel petals for the stem

And glow
Glow
Melt and flow
Eviscerate your fragile frame

And spill it out on the ragged floor
A thousand different versions of yourself
And if the old guard still offend
They got nothing left on which you depend

So enlist every ounce
Of your bright blood
And off with their heads
Jump from the you're not obliged to swallow anything you despise

See, those unrepenting buzzards want your life
And they got no right
As sure as you have eyes
They got no right
Just put yourself in my new shoes
And see that I do what I do
Because the old guard still offend (their pudgy hearts and slimy hands)
They've got nothing left on which we depend
So enlist every ounce
Of your bright blood
And off with their heads
Jump from the you're not obliged
To swallow anything you despise
That you despise
