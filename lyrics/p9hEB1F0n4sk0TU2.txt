I put my make up on and
Head for the other side of town
With my dress from the night before
Fading the countdown
Outside a sea of people forming
Walking after work this morning
They look right through me as I'm passing by
Not even so much as an evil eye

The city speaks to you
So much to live for, so much to lose
The end is coming, beginning is here
Anything you look for, you'll find it here
I found love in a foreign place
I could stay forever
It's my time, it's now or never

I've been so many places
Nowhere could ever turn me down
All I ever wanted was so much more
Than life in a small town
I find it hard to hide my feelings
Looking down to ancient buildings
Looking down on me, towering above
Time was standing still as we fell in love

The city speaks to you
So much to live for, so much to lose
The end is coming, beginning is here
Anything you look for, you'll find it here
I found love in a foreign place
I could stay forever
It's my time, it's now or never
I've had love as the world was ending
Not getting any younger
I feel life taking over

So much to live for, so much to lose
So much to live for, so much to lose

I've been so many places
Nowhere could ever turn me down
All I ever wanted was so much more
Than life in a small town

I found love in a foreign place
I could stay forever
It's my time, it's now or never
I've had love as the world was ending
Not getting any younger
I feel life taking over
