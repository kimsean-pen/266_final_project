Never did and never will
It's just the way it's always been
I've made mistakes before
I'll make the same again
And all this tension we ignore
It surely works its ugly way inside

I have known that nothing's fair
And surely what did I expect
When magic slips into the air
And every day is another test
And all this tension we ignore
It surely works its ugly way outside

So let it build, let it explode
Leaving blood and shattered bones
Or bite your tongue until you've forgotten what to say
And take another step back, until you find you've walked away

Silence's like disease, but I dare not say it hurts
Cause if I honestly react, nothing's ever gonna work
And all this tension back and forth
It's just the beauty of the ride
