So run
Right
Right back to school
Check it

Look back, I sift through all the cliques
Roaming the halls all year, making me sick
While everyone's out tryin to make the cut, what
And when you think you know me right I switch it up
Behind the wall, smoking cigarettes, sipping vodka
Hop a fence and catch a cab, ain't no one can stop us
Give me a break I'm on some other shit
While you're act like it's everything you got

Push back the square
Now that you need her, but you don't
Well there you go
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders of it all

Stop that, quit
All that, quit
Who ruined it?
You did, now grab a notebook and a pen
Start taking notes, on me and everyone who's on the top
You think we're on the same page but no, we're not
I'll be the man, watch your backpack, pens and pencils
Just like Keith now flippin' it, while you just keep it simple
You just can't go on, rockin' the clothes, copyin' the stance
'Cause really is everything that you're not!

Push back the square
Now that you need her, but you don't
So there you go
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders of it all

So transpose, or stop your life
It's what you do
Transpose
Or stop your lies
Run

So why don't you run? So why don't you run?
So why don't you run back to school?
So why don't you run? So why don't you run?

All you are
Now I'm on the next page
All you are
It's time to close the book up
All you are
Now I'm on the next page
All you are
Time to close the book up now!

Push back the square
Now that you need her, but you don't
So there you go
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders of it all

We are the leaders of it all
We are the leaders of it all
So right
So transpose or stop your life
It's what you do
Transpose
Or stop your lies
Run
So why don't you run? So why don't you run?
So why don't you run back to school?
So why don't you run? So why don't you run?
