There's a long hard road ahead
But a voice inside me said

You know there's something, oh, that you need to know
It's gonna be alright
Said there's something that you need to know
It's gonna be alright

When in this life, in this life
When I can only turn my chin
I know it's gonna be alright
When this big old town is closing in
And I have lost again, oh no

Here I could stay but I'll keep moving on
Here I could stay but I'll keep moving on
Could be I won't be wrong

There's a long hard road ahead
But a voice inside me said

Said there's something, oh, that you need to know
It's gonna be alright
Said there's something that you need to know
It's gonna be alright
