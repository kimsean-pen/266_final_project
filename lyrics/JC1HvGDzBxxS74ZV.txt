Together we can weather any storm
If we should ever become untethered
That would be so wrong

Thru the sunlight
Thru the raindrops
Chasing clouds away

Whether laughter
Whether teardrops
When our skies are grey

If together we endeavor
We can do no wrong
And we would never
Ever ever have to be alone

Thru the darkness
Till light blinds us
We'll be here to stay

Till we find us
Till love binds us
We will bend not break

Thru the sunlight
Thru the raindrops
Chasing clouds away
Whether laughter
Whether teardrops
When our skies are grey

Together we can weather any storm
