When did our heart
Stop beating?
Used up all the heat
When did it start?
Our meeting
It's been on repeat
I know there's a full moon every night
it's just not always bright
but it's been so long since I saw the light
maybe I haven't been looking at the sky

Maud
Now you're gone

Sweetheart please love me too long
My heart's too strong
Love me too long
Sweetheart please let me hold on
To these old songs
I've loved too long

When I'm in bed
I'm dead
No one to check my pulse
And so instead
My head
Begs not to be so full
and when I fall
asleep
which part of me writes the dream
and which part falls
asleep
who's running the machine?

I know theres a full moon every night
When I dress black it snows white

Maud
Now you're gone
