Time stands still
Call your name
Fall in love
But you say
'Don't you dare fall in love'
Don't you dare fall in love

Say I wont
Just to late
All I know
Time won't wait
Don't you dare fall in love
Don't you dare fall in love

Time stands still
Call your name
Fall in love
But you say
'Don't you dare fall in love'
Don't you dare fall in love
Over and Over again
Over and Over again
Over and Over again
Over and Over again
