A name, a face, about all I know
But I love you, or I think so...
Such an understanding goes beyond broken words
Won't be everlasting, don't want to be nobody's baby

So forget about tomorrows and yesterdays
They don't matter anyway

Tonight...
Baby, you are mine

Here we are, it's the same old place
With the same old you in a different face
Don't speak
Words get weaker and faker a bit more every time
I don't care what you got to say
Just want to drink, I don't want to think

And forget about tomorrows and yesterdays
They don't matter anyway

Tonight...
Baby, you are mine

Born without a past
Grown without a future
When does it get better?
Hey stranger, I need an answer
I believe we know each other
I see it in your look
It's been in all the books
The story of the doomed lovers
Maybe we'll make this time
Living and loving in time...
Maybe it's time

Tonight...
Baby, you are mine
