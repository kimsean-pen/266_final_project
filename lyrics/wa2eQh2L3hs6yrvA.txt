I can see that look that says beware
Try to move in closer if you dare
So I will sit and play my waiting game
And for a while I know she'll do the same
Oh No!

Watches like an eagle from its eerie
Then like a bird of prey she captures me
But I am older and more wise than you
Bird of prey straight into me you flew
Oh No!

Now every time I try to set her free, yeah
Oooh
I'm glad to say she comes right back to me
Aaah
But if I knew she didn't want to stay, yeah
Oooh Aaah
I wouldn't try to keep that lovely bird of prey
Oooh Aaah
Oooh Aaah
