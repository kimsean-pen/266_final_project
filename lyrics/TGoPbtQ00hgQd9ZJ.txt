You don't see me
My eyes are closed and I swear
You can't see me
I want you close but my arms are holding you back
I'll wait for you with both my eyes shut
You don't see me
But come here close,
Tear my hands down, pull off the blinds
Look me in the eyes

I know there's something
I know there's something real
Lately I'm haunted
These shadows hold me here

Screaming under water (SOS)
Can you hear me calling (SOS)
Did it to myself, now I need your help
Alone and overboard yelling SOS

My hands are shaking
Nobody's been here before
Oh will you see me?
Is it enough? Will you wake up, pull back the blinds,
Look me in the eyes?

I know there's something
I know there's something real
Lately I'm haunted
These shadows hold me here

Screaming under water (SOS)
Can you hear me calling (SOS)
Did it to myself, now I need your help
Alone and overboard yelling SOS

I know I want you but I'm drowning in fear
I know I want you but I'm drowning in fear
I know I want you but I'm drowning in fear
I'm finally ready,
Help me up up out of here

Screaming under water (SOS)
Can you hear me calling (SOS)
Did it to myself, now I need your help
Alone and overboard yelling SOS
