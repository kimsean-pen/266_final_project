You think you're so radical
I think you oughta stop
(Say what)

But you're going international
They're gonna call the cops
(No, no, no)

You're turning into
A poor man's Donald Trump
I know those circumstances
Make you wanna jump, oh no

You think you're radical
But you're not so radical
In fact, you're fanatical, fanatical

And you think you're a radical
But you're not so radical
In fact, you're fanatical, fanatical

I'll tell you right now
(Right now)
You oughta change your mind
(Yes)

All of your friends are
Standing in line
They're getting tired of
You're at it too fast
([Incomprehensible], [Incomprehensible])

Without all your bodyguards
How long would you last?
Not long, not long

You think you're radical
But you're not so radical
In fact, you're fanatical, fanatical

And you think you're a radical
But you're not so radical
In fact, you're just fanatical, fanatical

And you think you're a radical
But you're not so radical
In fact, you're fanatical, fanatical
