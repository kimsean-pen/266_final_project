Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
Section 80, HiiPower

Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song
The Serengeti's clone

Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slipped you my disc
You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick
Grown man should never bite they tongue
Unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the motherfucking pistol
Aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's Web is gonna miss you
My issue isn't televised and you ain't gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat cause our lives an instrumental
This is physical and mental
I wouln't sugar coat it
You'll die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want no plastic nation
Dread that like a Haitian
While you muthafckers waiting
I be off the slave ship, building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs

Just call this shit Hiipower
Nigga nothing less than Hiipower

5 star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean this shit is Huey Newton going stupid
You can't resist his HiiiPower
Throw your hands up for HiiiPower

Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I seen it how he seen it that would make my parents happy

Sorry momma I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widows peak, ugh
She always told me pray for the weak, ugh
Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, ugh

Dear Lord, come and save me, the Devils working hard
He probably clocking double shifts on all of his jobs

Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane
I need a license to kill
I'm standing on a feild full of landmines
Doing the moonwalk hoping I blow up in time
Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend
Tryna be a fucking legend
The man of mankind
Who said a black man in the illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs

Just call this shit Hiipower

Nigga nothing less than hiiipower
5 star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean this shit is Bobby Seale making meals
You can't resist his HiiiPower
Throw your hands up for HiiiPower

Everyday we fight the system just to make our way
We've been down for too long, but that's all right
We was built to be strong, cause it's our life, Na-na-nah
Everyday we fight the system, (fight the system)
(Never liked the system)
We've been down for too long, but that's all right, Na-na-nah

Who said a black man in the illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
Last time I checked we was racing with Marcus Garvey
On the freeway to Africa til I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs, once I'm on that pedestal
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing or Kurt Cobain
Loaded that clip and then said bang
The drama it bring is crazy
Product of the late 80's
Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the navy
Pull your guns and play me
Let's set it off, cause a riot, thow off molotov's
Somebody told me them pirates had got lost
Cause we've been off slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs
Just call this shit Hiipower
Nigga nothing less than Hiipower
5 star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean this shit is Fred Hampton on your campus
You can't resist his HiiiPower
Throw your hands up for HiiiPower
Thug life, thug life!
