Snakes in your eyes
Long legs, great thighs
You've got the cutest ass I've ever seen
Knock me down for a six anytime

Look at me, I gotta case of body language
Look at me, I gotta case of body language
Look at me, I gotta case of body language
Look at me, I gotta case of body language
A body language, a body language

Sexy body
Sexy, sexy body
I want your body
Baby, you're hot
