I'm looking down by the streets end
Girl you've been lacking a pretense

So save your money for the weak you're gonna kill
Cause I got something that the company know how to feel

I'm looking down by the streets end
Girl you've been lacking a pretense

There can't be anything between
It's automatic over me
Shoot like an animal machine
Straight from the colors of her dream

I'm looking over the deep end
Time ain't a reason for defense

Fly from a tree to a sea bed
Mean while, you've been locked in a freezer

There can't be anything between
It's automatic over me
Shoot like an animal machine
Straight from the colors of her dream
Colors of her dream
Shoot like an animal machine
Straight from the colors of her dream
Colors of her dream
Colors of her dream
Colors of her dream
Colors of her dream
