had a piggybank
like a lion's head
knocked it off the shelf
broke down by the bed
pennies from a skyscraper can kill
i've lined up my change
on the window sill

watched for hours
people down below
the wind has frozen my eyes
lost the courage
could not push them off
pulled my head inside

let a winter pass
laying in bed
my coins have all frozen to the window sill
walked the shadowed streets
in a happy fear
looking up for change
shining through the air

watched for hours
buildings fall through clouds
the wind has frozen my eyes
lost the courage
could not hold them up
fell asleep on a bench
pennies from a skyscraper can kill
