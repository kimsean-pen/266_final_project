Candles lighting windows
But the neighborhood is cold
Heartstrings galvanize feelings
Every thought is a transient chemical

Crises come with machetes
Harvesting the reactions, the moldy flavor of apathy
Trying to find the words to say
To take the visceral pain away

Terror bird, please eat me out
I want to live with the murder
Limelight eases emotion
Tiny bodies piling up, blinded by the cries for help

Can't feel it
I can't see it
I can't touch it
I am an inanimate

Tiny bodies piling up, blinded by the cries for help
I can't feel
I can't feel
