I stole your magazine
The one with the beauty queen on the front
I see her look at me,
I swear that it is mockingly
What the f*ck?
And you decide what I should like
But I don't buy no hype
Like in the magazine
The one with the beauty queen on the front

I wanna run, run far away
I gotta get far away from you
I gotta keep my identity
And focus what I can do, oh!

I don't want to be famous
If I got to be shameless
If you don't know what my name is, name is
So what, so what?
I don't know what this game is
Cause I'm not even playing it
You don't know what my name is, name is
So what, so what?

She's just a chickadee
They chose her for celebrity
It's all a stunt
Why does it get to me
'Til I react so angrily to this stuff?
And maybe I'm not worth your time
Not a stop upon your climb
It doesn't bother me,
It's just my insecurities acting up

I wanna run, run far away
I gotta get far away from you
I gotta keep my identity
And focus on what I can do, oh!

So take a shot for free
And photoshop the bits of me that you don't want
I'll steal your magazine
The one with the beauty queen on the front

I don't want to be famous
If I got to be shameless
If you don't know what my name is, name is
So what, so what?
I don't know what this game is
Cause I'm not even playing it
You don't know what my name is, name is
So what, so what?
So what, so what?
So what, so what?
So what, so what?
So what?

I read your magazine,
But maybe change a couple things
Like just be honest, don't be mean
Now everybody f*cking sing

I don't want to be famous
If I got to be shameless
If you don't know what my name is, name is
So what, so what?
I don't know what this game is
Cause I'm not even playing it
You don't know what my name is, name is
So what, so what?
