Isn't much more I can do for you
Isn't much more that I can try
Twisting myself into shapes
To stop you crying
What'll I do if I lose you
What'll I do if I lose
Difficulty is coming my way
Coming my way

Making my way into places
Only been seen on your darkest days
Breaking my heart to take a walk
Into your jungle
What can I do in this world for you
If difficulty is my friend
Keeping me company when I know
I don't need it
I don't need it

[Chorus]
You change every day
You change every day
(What can I do to make you notice)
You change every day
You change every day
(A little more time to bring you home)
You change every day
You change every day
How can I tell you the truth
When I don't want to

Possible days in my future
Possible ways into my past
Sewing it up nice and tightly
So I don't wonder

What if I did so much more for you
And what if I'd said so much more
Difficulty would be a stranger
A stranger to me

[Chorus]
You change every day
You change every day
(What can I do to make you notice)
You change every day
You change every day
(A little more time to bring you home)
You change every day
You change every day
How can I tell you the truth
...

Oh, yeah (x3)
I'm governed by difficulty

[Chorus]
You change every day
You change every day
(What can I do to make you notice)
You change every day
You change every day
(A little more time to bring you home)
You change every day
You change every day
How can I tell you the truth
When I don't want to
