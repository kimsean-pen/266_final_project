"I want your skin
I want your mouth
I want your eyes"

"You project, all these qualities onto me
You don't know me
This is what happens betwe-"

If I had a nickel for every time I think I did something stupid
Then I'd have a shit ton of nickels
That shit was stupid, now
Run it back, take it back
Hold it back, take it back
Run it back, run it back, run it back
Imma kill the fucking white whale
Imma give the Dick a damn heart attack

If I had nickel for every time I think I did something dumb
I'd be as rich as a man with no kids and a decent income
I'll be richer than shit call me yung Richie Rich
I'm the 9-4 Macaulay, The Culkin, the kid
I've been stuck in the sea on the a hunt for a taste
Looking for love but I only caught, only caught (bass)

I know you better than you know yourself
Well, my self said you can go straight to hell
Get it, (uh) fuck it up, (uh) what's the point of being sad?
Oh you jealous? Oh you mad?
Honey, you don't know the half
You don't know baby
Uh, fuck it up

If I had a nickel for every time I think I'm fallin' in love
I don't even like her that much
Shit I'm in love, ok
Run it back, take it back
Hold it back, take it back
Run it back, run it back, who is that?
I've been feeling fucking psychotic
Seeing you and him
I pray for cataracts

If I had a nickel for every time I talk but don't ever listen
I'b bring home the bacon, be making a killing
Be richer than men who invented religions
I'm having a vision
I hope its a great one
No whammys, no whammys
That's so fucking Raven
I'm out on the dock
Go to the bay
Hunting for love but I only caught, only caught (bass)

I know you better than you know yourself
Well, my self said you can go straight to hell
Get it, (uh) fuck it up, (uh) what's the point of being sad?
Oh you jealous? Oh you mad?
Honey, you don't know the half
You don't know baby
Uh, fuck it up

I'm not the one that you wanted
But dammit I think I could be what you need
I'm not the Honda you wanted
But dammit I run and you got me for free (Yeah)
I'm not the puppy you wanted (uh)
Look at me eating the treat
But you know deep in your mind there's a thing
Singing, "There's plenty of fish in the sea"
When I was 13, I had my first love
When I was 17, that's when I made love
That's when I made love, that's when I made love
That's when I made a white whale named Jacob

I know you better than you know yourself
Well, my self said you can go straight to hell
Get it, (uh) fuck it up, (uh) what's the point of being sad?
Oh you jealous? Oh you mad?
Honey, you don't know the half
You don't know baby
Uh, fuck it up
