take a look around oooh
take a look around
get on the floor and close your eyes
and then be
get on the floor and close your eyes
let the love electric key
you'll never be alone again
take a look around
there's all your friends
reach out
get a hole or somebody
there will be no problem if you just move your body
tonight
tonight
reach out
tonight
tonight
take a look around and see
the love that's in the air
whomever you want to be
you really should take care
tonight's the night for feeling good
there's a boy from your neighbourhood
reach out
get a hole of somebody
there would be no problem if you just move your body
tonight
you can dance if you want to
you can dream if you want to
you can leave if you want to
make believe if you want to
you can see if you want to
you can touch if you want to
you can play if you want to
you can stay if you want to

you can dance if you want to
you can dream if you want to
you can leave if you want to
make believe if you want to
you can see if you want to
you can touch if you want to
you can play if you want to
you can stay if you want to
tonight
take a look around oooh
take
just let the music take control
you got nothing to fear
feeling deep down in you soul
keep your mind
