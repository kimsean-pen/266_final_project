When will I feel this
As vivid as it truly is,
Fall in love in a single touch,
And fall apart when it hurts too much?

Can we skip past near-death clich√©s
Where my heart restarts, as my life replays?
All I want is to flip a switch
Before something breaks that cannot be fixed.

I know, I know - the sirens sound
Just before the walls come down.
Pain is a well-intentioned weatherman
Predicting God as best he can,
But God I want to feel again.

Rain or shine, I don't feel a thing,
Just some information upon my skin.
I miss the subtle aches when the weather changed,
The barometric pressure we always blamed.

All I want is to flip a switch
Before something breaks that cannot be fixed.

Invisible machinery,
These moving parts inside of me
Well, they've been shutting down for quite some time,
Leaving only rust behind.

Well I know, I know - the sirens sound
Just before the walls come down.
Pain is a well-intentioned weatherman
Predicting God as best he can,
But God I want to feel again,
Oh God I want to feel again.

Down my arms, a thousand satellites
Suddenly discover signs of life.
