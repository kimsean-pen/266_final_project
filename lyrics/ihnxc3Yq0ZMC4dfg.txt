The perfect taste that leaves your mouth
The vodka tongue that spits it out

Violate me, January victim
All my life I've wasted for this
Violate me, show me your religion
All my time I've waited

Simple girl, simple girl
I need you in the world, my simple girl

And so the kiss became the cold
After the crash and my cosmetic lows

You resurrect me, stand me to attention
Take my voices, learn to love them
You're the Christmas promising the Summer
All my life I've waited

Simple girl, simple girl
I need you in the world, my simple girl
Simple girl, my simple girl
My simple girl, my simple girl

My simple girl, my simple girl
I need you in the world
Want you in the world
