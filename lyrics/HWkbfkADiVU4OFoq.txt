When you go
I will be
All alone

What's left of you
Is left in me
In this home

I close my eyes
And I can
Almost see:

The look you gave
When you
You ran from me

The way you call
The way you walk
You walk in me

Believing you
Is leaving me
When I bend

And all the boys
And what they say:
You're on your own

And I know
I know
It's been done

I close my eyes
And I can
Almost see:

The look you gave
When you
You ran from me

I wanna know
I wanna know
Where you've been

You're coming home
You're coming home
Just tell me when

I need to know
When I will be -
By your side

I close my eyes
And I can
Almost see:

The look you gave
When you
You ran from me

Close my eyes
And I can
Almost see:

The look you gave
When you
You ran from me
