Violent breathing
keeps the oxygen kissing torn up lungs.
My hearts beating but it won't keep me from saving everyone.
Yet I still have
messages to send to those I love.
Violent breathing, it won't keep me from saving everyone.
So we sing into the night
and break all the silence.

With one attempt to rise the broken from the dead.
Avenge their souls and mend their souls.
We sing into the night.
Feel your heart through my hands.
I feel your loneliness I'm reaching out to you.
Give the beat just a chance
to lift you up and out,

bring you above the ground.
Feel my heart through my hands.
I feel your loneliness I'm reaching out to you.
Give the beat just a chance
to lift you up and out,
bring you above the ground.
So we sing into the night
and break all the silence.

With one attempt to rise the broken from the dead.
Avenge their souls and mend their souls.
We sing into the night.
I'll do whatever it takes
whatever it takes to break the silence
I'll do whatever it takes
To break the silence

break the silence
So we sing into the night
and break all the silence.
With one attempt to rise the broken from the dead.
Avenge their souls and mend their souls.
We sing into the night.
