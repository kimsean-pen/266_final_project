I just want to tell you, all the things you are
And all the things you mean to me
When I find myself believing, there's no place to go
When I feel the loneliness inside my heart

You're the answer to my prayers and you're with me everywhere
You're my angel, miracle, you're all I need tonight
And give me shelter from the rain, you breathe life in me again
You're my angel, miracle
you're all I need to know, tonight

Life is just a moment, we're blowing in the wind
We're trying to find a friend
And only time can tell us, if we win or if we lose
And who will stand beside us

When there's darkness all around me, you're the light I see
Oh when I need someone to ease my troubled mind

You're the answer to my prayers and you're with me everywhere
You're my angel, miracle, you're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain, you breathe life in me again
You're my angel, miracle
you're all I need to know, tonight yeah
You're the answer to my prayers and you're with me everywhere
You're my angel, miracle, you're all I need tonight
Give me shelter from the rain, you breathe life in me again
You're my angel, my miracle
you're all I need to know, tonight yeah
You're my angel 'tonight tonight tonight
tonight
You're my angel
tonight
