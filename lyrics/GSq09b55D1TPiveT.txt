St. Nick don't exist anymore
And Oz was just a lonely man
It's so damn hard to believe in anything again
Wise is the optimist
But truth is I don't understand
Haven't figured out much of anything

What a strange world
Strange world, strange world

'Round and 'round and 'round it goes
Heroes fall like dominoes
We try to help it, but we won't
All we know is that we don't
'Round and 'round and 'round we go
The chips will fall, and so it goes
And it's all out of our control
All we know is that we don't

Is this all there is?
Preachers and rocket ships
Have never quite made any sense of it, yeah
Paul says, "Let it be"
But the other said, "The test is key"
I say, "Where's the line between real and fantasy?"

In this strange world
Strange world, strange world, hey

'Round and 'round and 'round it goes
Heroes fall like dominoes
We try to help it, but we won't
All we know is that we don't
'Round and 'round and 'round we go
The chips will fall, and so it goes
And it's all out of our control
All we know is that we don't

All we know is that we don't
We don't, we don't
Strange world, strange world, strange world

'Round and 'round and 'round it goes
Heroes fall like dominoes (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We try to help it but we won't (We won't)
All we know is that we don't (Yeah)
'Round and 'round and 'round we go (We go)
The chips will fall, and so it goes (And so it goes)
And it's all out of our control
All we know is that we don't

Strange, strange
Strange world
