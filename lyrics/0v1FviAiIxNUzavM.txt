On Two bicycles
On a hillside desolate
Could nature make a man of me yet?

Under this charming car
This charming man

Why ponder life's complexities
When the leather runs smooth
On the passenger seat?

I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said "it's crucial
That someone so handsome should care"

Ah! I'm just a country boy
Who never knew his place
He said "return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things

I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said "it's crucial
That someone so handsome should care"
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man ...
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man ...

Ah! I'm just a country boy
Who never knew his place
He said "return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
