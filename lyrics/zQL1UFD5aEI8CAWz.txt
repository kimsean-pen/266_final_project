I walk the road when I realise my death
The road that knows about my pity, little past
I grab one note and put it in my pocket
With your birds

I walked the road
until I came close to your house
Your house was floating on my water
I asked one tree one tree to take me in
To your house
And there I took all of your birds
And I smashed them in my pocket-Oh
And then I got the feathers off and
I made myself a beautiful dress

In your basement was a letter to myself
You wrote it when we were married
I took this note and put it in my mouth
With your words

And then I took all your words
and I ate them by the fire-Oh
And then I tore the pages up
and I made myself a beautiful dress

I spoke your words out in your garden where
I built my new house near your flowers, trees & bees
I told our trees and bees to fly away
With your words and your birds
And then I took all your words and I ate them by the fire-Oh
And in the morning i climbed your tree and flew away
