Walk down Portobello road to the sound of reggae
I am alive
The age of gold, yes the age of
The age of old
The age of gold
The age of music is past
I hear them talk as I walk, yes I hear them talk
I hear they say
Expect the final blast
Walk down Portobello road to the sound of reggae
I am alive

I'm alive and vivo, muito vivo, vivo, vivo
Feel the sound of music banging in my belly
Know that one day I must die
I am alive
I'm alive and vivo muito vivo, vivo, vivo
In the Eletric Cinema or on the telly, telly, telly
Nine out of ten movie stars make me cry
I am alive
And nine out of ten film stars make me cry
I am alive
