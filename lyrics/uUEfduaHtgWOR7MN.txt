Waking up is harder
Than it seems
Wandering through these empty rooms of
Dusty books and quiet dreams
Pictures on the mantle
Speak your name
Softly like forgotten tunes
Just outside the sound of pain

Weren't we like a pair of thieves
With tumbled locks and broken codes
You can not take that from me
My small reprieves, your heart of gold
Weren't we like a battlefield
Locked inside a holy war
You're lovin' my due diligence
The only thing worth fighting for

Change will come to those who
Have no fear
But I'm not her, and you never were
The kind who kept a rulebook nea
What I said was never, what I meant
And now you've seen my world in flames
My shadow songs, my deep regret

Weren't we like a pair of thieves
With tumbled locks and broken codes
You can not take that from me
My small reprieves, your heart of gold
Weren't we like a battlefield
Locked inside a holy war
You're lovin' my due diligence
The only thing worth fighting for
The only thing worth fighting for
