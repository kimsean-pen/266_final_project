She was a young girl, eighteen
Addicted to the dreams of bein' on the big screen
Then late one nigh, kissed her mama goodbye
Took the keys to the car and drove off in the night

Don't be in a rush to leave
You'll never get these days again
But she was blinded by all the stars in her eyes

All she wanted was the Hollywood life
It's not always what it seems, oh no
It's the Hollywood life
The land of a million dreams, oh

They follow the glow
But God only knows what it will show to you
But when the sun goes down
You can almost hear the sound of the broken dreams on the ground

She was raised in a small town
She's been here for a year, her body losin' weight now
Never called back home, she's embarrassed to go
She don't eat, she don't sleep, all she hearing is no

She feels like there's no place to go
There's no one there to hold her close
So in comes the night with the tears in her eyes

All she wanted was the Hollywood life
It's not always what it seems, oh no
It's the Hollywood life
The land of a million dreams, oh, woah

They follow the glow
But God only knows what it will show to you
When the sun goes down
You can almost hear the sound of the broken dreams on the ground

All she wanted was to live the life
Her mom got a call form her baby late one night
It was crying on the other end of the phone
She told her baby please just come back home
Everything is going to be alright this time

Hollywood life
It's not always what it seems, oh no
It's the Hollywood life
The land of a million dreams, oh

They follow the glow
But God only knows what it will show to you
When the sun goes down you can hear the sounds of the dreams

Hollywood life
It's not always what it seems, oh no
It's the Hollywood life
The land of a million dreams, oh

They follow the glow
But God only knows what it will show to you
When the sun goes down
You can almost hear the sound of the broken dreams on the ground
