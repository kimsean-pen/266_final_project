Did I introduce you to the kinds of things you thought you knew?
But not like buddy-buddy,
it's not just me, things seemed much sunnier back then
Doesn't really make a difference to me,
take a bunch of pills and crash in to me
Do it again for old time's sake Look at
me now, there's nothing else left to break
Cause all I ever wanted was to see things don't mean much
And even though it isn't true, I think I'm still in love with you
Beat myself in to the crown, all I do is hang around
Nothing I could do or say is ever gonna make you wanna stay
And all I ever wanted was to say "I think I'm still in love"
And even though it isn't true, I think I'm still in love with you
And even if it isn't right, I still gotta put up a fight
You could leave me black and blue, I think I'm still in love with you
I think I'm still in love with you (I think I'm still in love)
I think I'm still in love with you (I think I'm still in love)
I think I'm still in love with you
