Cry cry baby
Cry cry baby
I'm not your baby

Broken teeth as bad ideas
Put us on our knees bad luck born in a hurricane
The bad things come in three

I saw the world disappearing in your skin
And the sky starting to spin

I will cross your heart and hope that you die
I will break it from just like you broke mine

So you can cry for me, baby
Cry cry baby
Cry for me, baby
I'm not your baby
I only hurt the ones i love
I only hurt the ones i love

We are playing war inside the flame
Nothing more to say
I can not remove the ring to that midnight bell
Is the path we choose to take

Take a breath, we forget to breathe
Make a sound, break the silence in me

I will cross your heart and hope that you will die
I'll break it from just like you broke mine

So you can cry for me, baby
Cry cry baby
Cry cry for me, baby
I'm not your baby
I only hurt the ones i love
I only hurt the ones i love

Cry cry for me, baby
Cry cry baby
Cry cry for me, baby
I'm not your baby
I only hurt the ones i love
I only hurt the ones i love

Between what is right and what is real
Just take what you can steal
I had to do what i die
Because it only hurt the onse i love

So you can cry for me, baby
Cry cry baby
Cry cry for me, baby
I'm not your baby
I only hurt the onse i love
I only hurt the onse i love

Cry for me, baby
Cry cry baby
Cry for me, baby
I'm not your baby
I only hurt the onse i love
I only hurt the onse i love
