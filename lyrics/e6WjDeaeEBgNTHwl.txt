Wanna feel something
(Wanna feel something)
Just wanna feel something
(Wanna feel something)

I've been leaving my heart in all the wrong places
Took it back way too soon when I should've been patient
I built all these walls so no one could break in
Truth it, I miss those nights when my heart could be naked

I don't need to feel love
I just wanna feel something
If it's never enough
At least it's better than nothing

After everyone I've lost
And every kiss I wasted
I don't, I don't need to feel love
Just wanna feel something (Something)
Just wanna feel something (Something)
Just wanna feel something (Something)
I just wanna feel

I waited so long to feel like I'm worthy
Find someone who could rewrite the pages I'm turning
I've grown with the pain, bathed in the lonely
All I want in this moment is someone to hold me

I don't need to feel love
I just wanna feel something
If it's never enough
At least it's better than nothing

After everyone I've lost
And every kiss I wasted
I don't, I don't need to feel love
Just wanna feel something (Something)
Just wanna feel something (Something)
I just wanna feel something (Something)
I just wanna feel

Just wanna feel something (Something)
I don't wanna feel nothing
I don't, I don't, I don't, no (Just wanna feel something)
I don't, I don't wanna feel nothing
I don't, I don't
Just wanna feel something
Just wanna feel something
