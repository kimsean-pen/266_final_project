I ride around at the speed of sound, still
Going in hard till my heart is drowned
In the smokey depths of reckless fun...
Makin em laugh it comes so easy -
I'm prangin out though, do they believe me?
Knocking it back and shooting it up -
Fizzing through my bloodstream
Living as i choose -
Confused...
Hide behind this smile like a wayward child
Wasting my youth -
What's the use?
As I turn the dial, for the briefest while
I don't miss u...

I feel it in my fingertips
In the edges of my lips
Bright blue glistening
Are you listening?
Listen to me

In the sweetness of danger
To myself i'm a stranger -
Living like a loaded gun
From myself i'm on the run...
Down the road i still soldier -
Watch the world getting older
Tell me i'm the only one u want
Tangled in the spiderweb u spun...

I refuse, to lose...
Hide behind this smile
Like a wayward child
Wasting my youth
What's the use?
As I turn the dial, for the briefest while
I don't miss u...

I feel it in my fingertips
In the edges of my lips
Bright blue glistening
Are you listening?
Listen to me

Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah

I feel it in my fingertips
In the edges of my lips
Bright blue glistening
Are you listening?
Listen to me

I feel it in my fingertips
In the edges of my lips
Bright blue glistening
Are you listening?
Listen to me
