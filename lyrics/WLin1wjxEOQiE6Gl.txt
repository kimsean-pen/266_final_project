Worried girl
Shaves her legs
Creams her arms
And she creams her chest

Worried girl
Shave it
Shave it, shave it, shave it

Plug your brow
Plug it now
Until it's sore
Drop the blood on the floor

Oh, worried girl
Shave it
Shave it, shave it, shave it

Shower scenes
A giggling tease
And stupid magazines
Spread a social disease

Oh, worried girl

Lady shave
Don't misuse that blade
Lady shave
Don't slip that blade

Oh, worried girl
You don't have to shave it
Shave it, shave it, shave it
Shave it, shave it, shave it

Lady shave
Oh, lady shave
Lady shave
Oh, lady shave
Lady shave
Oh, lady shave

Shave it, shave it, shave it
Shave it, shave it, shave it
Shave it, shave it, shave it
