Living in silence
Born in the fire
And I don't want it anymore
Crawling, lifeless
Haunted by this
And I can't take it anymore
This feeling's taking over
My demons pull me under
Your shadow's getting closer
And I don't even want to fight it
You left me cold and empty
Broken and going crazy
One day I know what you'll see
I am just a monster that you made me
Awake, not sleeping
So sick, and calling out
But you run from the sound
I crave the piece you took from me
I'm chasing what I used to be
And all I see
This feeling's taking over
My demons pull me under
Your shadow's getting closer
And I don't even want to fight it
You left me cold and empty
Broken and going crazy
One day I know what you'll see
I am just a monster that you made me
You break me down
Strain me out
I thought I'll leave it all right now
I'm broken down
I'm strained, worn out
You turned me into someone else
This feeling's taking over
My demons pull me under
Your shadow's getting closer
And I don't even want to fight it
You left me cold and empty
Broken and going crazy
One day I know what you'll see
I am just a monster that you made me
