What's up?
How's it going?
The unreal cheekbone
She is so dreamy
That she got features on Fellini
Deadpan, unimpressed
Archimedes Palimpsest
Just hanging out all Julian Casablancas

She is an epiphany
Her electricity opens my days like she always knew
I feel like affinity, look at me, a deity
In all the ways, she's a break-thru

Under the sun, there's nothing new
But she keeps it 100 in the shade
She's a break-thru
It's cold out there
That's nothing new
But she keeps it 100 through the shade
She's a break-thru

She is so wild
Middle-earth highbrow
Her line is Pablo but her color's Fauves
What about it?
Just to review
She will a-break thru
Nobody stops her
No one can lock her down

She is an epiphany
Her electricity opens my days like she always knew
I feel like affinity, look at me, a deity
In all her ways, she's a break-thru

Under the sun, there's nothing new
But she keeps it 100 in the shade
She's a break-thru
It's cold out there
That's nothing new
But she keeps it 100 through the shade
She's a break-thru

She's a break-thru
She's a break-thru
She's a break-thru
She's a break-thru

Under the sun, there's nothing new
But she keeps it 100 in the shade
She's a break-thru
It's hot out here
And warm indoors
But she keeps it 100 through the shade
She's a break-thru

She's a break-thru
She's a break-thru
She's a break-thru
She's a break-thru
