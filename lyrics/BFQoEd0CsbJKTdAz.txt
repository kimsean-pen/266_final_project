So you wanna party? So you wanna dance?
You better know someone, then find someone of our friends
You wanna get higher? Shake that ass
Spinning round and round, and round and round like that

I put a little twist in my hips (here we go)
Kiss on my lips (here we go)
Ice on my wrist ‘cause I'm hot and I'm dancing (here we go)
Caught that romancin' (here we go)
Cancel your plans and (here we go)
Girls hide your mans, ‘cause I'm hot and I'm dancing (here we go)

This is emergency (wooh ooh ooh)
Call an ambulance, come rescue me (wooh ooh ooh)
Everybody in this bitch (wooh ooh ooh)
If you wanna get up, get down like this (Ah, ha, ha)

Wooh ooh ooh, here we go
Wooh ooh ooh, here we go (Party)
Wooh ooh ooh, here we go (Party)
(Ahhhhhh) Wooh ooh ooh

Hallelujah, oh mercy me
Confess your sins and get down on your knees
And I'll be good to you if you're good to me
And we can go on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on

I put a little twist in my hips (here we go)
Kiss on my lips (here we go)
Ice on my wrist ‘cause I'm hot and I'm dancing (here we go)
Caught that romancin' (here we go)
Cancel your plans and (here we go)
Girls hide your mans, ‘cause I'm hot and I'm dancing (here we go)

This is emergency (wooh ooh ooh)
Call an ambulance, come rescue me (wooh ooh ooh)
Everybody in this bitch (wooh ooh ooh){Ha, ha, ha}
If you wanna get up, get down like this (Ah, ha, ha)

Here we go, here we go (Party)
Wooh ooh ooh, here we go (Party)
(Ahhhhh) Wooh ooh ooh (la, la, la, la, la...)

This is emergency
Call an ambulance, come rescue me
Everybody in this bitch {Ha, ha, ha}
If you wanna get up, get down like this {Ahhhhh woo}

Here we go, here we go (Party)
Wooh ooh ooh, here we go (Party)
Wooh ooh ooh, here we go

Here we go
