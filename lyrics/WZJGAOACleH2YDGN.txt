I wait for you.
I don't know why.
all i know is i can't hide.
at this temperature you could take over my mind.
like gossamer, you softly touch.
he draws me in, i'm powerless.
he possesses an enchantment.

tell me i'm forgiven.
he calls, don't know how i fell under his spell.
lately i've been driven. he smiles, an enchantment.

i wait for you.
I'm mesmerized this love is like a potion in disguise.
i'd tightrope walk with a blindfold on my eyes.
I can't escape, or so it seems.
I'd run away, he's in my dreams.
he possesses an enchantment.

tell me i'm forgiven.
he calls, don't know how i fell under his spell.
lately i've been driven.
he smiles, an enchantment.

it's the kind of sleepwalk that never ends.
a type of loan with no dividends.
it's a parlour game where you're given chase.
guess it could be called an acquired taste.
i know, he knows, he calls, i go, i know.
this could be an enchantment.

why don't you tell me i'm forgiven?
he calls, don't you know how i fell under his spell.
i'm forgiven... lately i've been driven.
he smiles and i give in,
-an enchantment.
