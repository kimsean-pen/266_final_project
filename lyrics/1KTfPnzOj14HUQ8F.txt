It can't be
You stole the keys from me
You locked me inside my rumor gloom
It's too dark to think that I love you
I think love you too much
I love you too damn much

Got to go
Cause now i'm living, stop the lies
That I've been living
Got to leave what i've been giving,
Get another life,
Without your love

Got to go
Cause now i'm living, stop the lies
That I've been living
Got to leave what i've been giving,
Get another life,
Without your love

I'm not free
I can hardly breath
You locked me outside my heart
It's too dark to think that I love you
I think I love you too much
I love you too damn much

Got to go
Cause now i'm living, stop the lies
That I've been living
Got to leave what i've been giving,
Get another life,
Without your love

Got to go
Cause now i'm living, stop the lies
That I've been living
Got to leave what i've been giving,
Get another life,
Without your love

You want me to be nothing
You want me to be nothing
Without you
I love you too damn much

Got to go
Cause now i'm living, stop the lies
That I've been living
Got to leave what i've been giving,
Get another life,
Without your love
