Caught in the river, turning blue
Hold your breath as it covers you
Oooh, oooh

Caught in the river, turning blue
Hold your breath as it covers you
Open that mouth and show me something
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh

Caught in the river, turning blue
Hold your breath as it covers you
Open that mouth and show me something
Hold your breath as it covers you

Nothing without you here
I'm nothing, I disappear
Till nothing but my heart remains
For you
We'll lie awake, I'll ask myself
Who do you think you are

When you inhale, I fill your lungs

Ya ya ya ya yah!
Ya ya ya ya yah!
Ya ya ya ya yah!
Ya ya ya ya yah!

Nothing but my heart remains
Nothing but my heart remains
Nothing but my heart remains
Nothing but my heart remains
Ya ya ya ya yah!
