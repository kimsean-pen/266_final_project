No one is harder on me than myself
Or so it seems
Some say that you are my curse, my own worst enemy
I think they're wrong
They never thought our life could be like this
They never thought

I'll be your safe ride home when you call me,
I'll be everything and more
When you call my name

I thought no one is smarter than me
No, I don't need anyone's help!
Or so it seemed
You changed me for the good
They never understood
But even if they tried I doubt they could
So take my nervous hand and we can take a stand
We don't have to live by their demands
I never thought life could be like this
I never thought

I'll be your safe ride home when you call me,
I'll be everything and more
When you call my name
I'll be your safe ride home when you call me,
I'll be everything and more
When you call my name

When I'm with you there's no worries
When I'm with you there's no shame
When I'm with you, I'm secure
We choose to live against the grain
They could say we lack the progress
They could say that we're a mess
They could say we'll never make it
And I know we're better than their test
And I don't hear them anyway

I'll be your safe ride home when you call me,
I'll be everything and more
When you call my name
I'll be your safe ride home when you call me,
I'll be everything (x6)
and more
When you call my name
I'll be your safe ride home when you call me,
I'll be everything and more
When you call my name
