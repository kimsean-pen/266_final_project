Cause the world might do me in
It's all right cause I'm with friends
Cause I'm giving up again
It doesn't matter

And I'm feeling like a ghost
And it's what I hate the most
Cause I'm giving up again
And this time (this time, this time)

This time I might just disappear
This time I might just dis...
This time I might just disappear
This time I might just dis...

Try and hear me then I'm done
Cause I might just say this once
Seen this played out in my dream
It doesn't matter

Time for givin' up the ghost
Fuck it's you I hate the most
And there is no guarantee
It doesn't matter
This time I might just disappear
This time I might just dis...
This time I might just disappear
This time I might just dis...
This time I might just disappear
This time I might just dis...
This time I might just disappear
This time I might just dis...

This time I might just disappear
This time I might just dis...
This time I might just dissapear
This time I might just dis...
