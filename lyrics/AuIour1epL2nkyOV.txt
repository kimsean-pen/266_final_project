Body outlined in chalk
Guaranteed not to talk
Witnessed a murder spree
Can't let you convict me
Your testimony's going down with you to the grave
I made sure of it just in case
No one's gonna put me back into a cage
I think it's for the best... bleed the fifth
Shouldn't have run your mouth
You can't hide from me now
Those pigs are none the wiser
And your fertilizer
Your testimony's going down with you to the grave
I made sure of it just in case
No one's gonna put me back into a cage
Especially you
Bleed The Fifth!
