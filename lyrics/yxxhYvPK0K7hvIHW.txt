All games they play
Undead and awake and returning within
You are a devil, they say
and its candy

how long I've known
this seed burst and grown
You're the one that I love
You are the one that I trust,
and its candy

When they speak of the open door
and the way you've flown, its fine
When they show me the evidence
and theyre talking down your memory

Nevermind the words they waste
They can't see you're mine
Waiting here until words run out
Dreaming of the day when you
open your arms in the light of our love

All games they play
Undead and awake and returning within
You are a devil they say
and its candy

how long I've known
this seed burst and grown
You're the one that I love
You are the one that I trust,
and its candy

When they speak of the open door
and the way you've flown, its fine
When they show me the evidence
and they're talking down your memory

Nevermind the words they waste
They can't see you're mine
Waiting here until words run out
Dreaming of the day when you
open your arms in the light of our love

When they speak of the open door
and the way you've flown, its fine
When they show me the evidence
and they're talking down your memory

Nevermind the words they waste
They can't see youre mine
Waiting here until words run out
Dreaming of the day when you
open your arms in the light of our love
