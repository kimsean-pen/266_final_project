Sunlight and you hold me as I breathe
It's a summer time
'Cause I'm blowing though the breeze

You say I'm born to you
I'm born to see the day come through
I should care for you
Like you want me too

I don't want to seem alright
I don't want to see no more
Alright
Woah I don't want to see no more
Alright
Oh I don't want to see no more
No I,
Turn me up in this place hmm
It's an ocean of sounds yeah
'said turn me up in this place
Till the notion is found
Seems like I've been such a stranger hmm
It's seems like everything is wrong
It feels like I've been gone for ages

And soon to done too long too long
Too long too long

The time has come for change yeah
With no where to escape
With different circumstances I shouldn't needed to behave
The time has come for chang'en
With no where to escape
With different circumstances
I should have needed to behave
