won't you open a window sometime
what's so wrong with the light
what's so wrong with the light
wind in your hair, sun in your eyes
light
light

we throw our shadows down
we must throw our shadows down
we live and throw our shadows down
it's how we get around
in the sun
in the sun

why can't you see
why can't you see
why can't you see
are you blind
are you blind
are you blind
are you dead
oh really
are you all right
are you all right

won't you open a window sometime
won't you open a window sometime
what's so wrong with the light
what's so wrong with the light
wind in your hair, sun in your eyes
what's so wrong with the light
what's so wrong with the light
what's so wrong with the light
what's so wrong with the light
what's so wrong with the light
what's so wrong with the light
