On a journey ill
My mind floats astray
Over withered fields
I cross the river

This shortness of breath
Between birth and grave
Fading in the distance
I am nothing

Watch the skeleton dance
Dancing on my grave
My frozen hour of death

Watch the skeleton dance
Dance On my grave
My frozen hour of death

Here I am alone
Casting my own shadows
Traversing the mundane
Desperate cry

Boundless darkness
A voiceless fear
Unheard, unseen
It is coming near

Watch the skeleton dance
Dancing on my grave
My frozen hour of death
Watch the skeleton dance
Here I am - alone

Had I not known
That I was dead
I would have mourned
My loss of life
Loss of life

Watch the skeleton dance
Dancing on my grave
My frozen hour of death

Watch the skeleton dance
On my grave
My frozen hour of death
Between birth and grave
Here I am alone
