You can find all you need
The message is in the silence
Whisper words to calm your mind
Reach inside, numb the pain
Come around with answers

We are ghosts of the concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind?
Sounds of a playground fading

Staring into bright lights
I am what I've done
It is useless to hide
An empty chamber, guess I was part of a plan

We are ghosts of the concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind?
Sounds of a playground fading

We're running out of time
Can't seem to recognize
What put us here in the first place
Counting down the days
Beginning of the end

We are ghosts of the concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind?
We are ghosts of the concrete world
Genetic codes of a dying breed
Will I be left behind?
