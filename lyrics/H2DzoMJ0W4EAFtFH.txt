If I call for you
Will it feed the flame
When it already breaks us in two
Cause I want a glance
Of how the story ends
But I already know the truth

What would I have to gain
If I had everything so few
But I'm relieved its yours

With my feelings on the line
I would do anything to fight
This raging force

So I won't go for more
I won't go for more
Till the rain stops

Wouldn't go for more
Wouldn't go for more
Till the haze drops

Found the light
And hold it close to you
But it's already too late for that

I could sing the notes
Hopeless as they sound
Their encouragement in my head

Our lives down the drain
I would do anything for you
I can take the blame

My heart's on the line
I can't do anything but lose
This changing game

So I won't go for more
I won't go for more
Till the rain stops

Wouldn't go for more
Wouldn't go for more
Till the haze drops

I won't go for more
I won't go for more
Till the rain stops

Wouldn't go for more
I won't go for more
Till the haze drops

But I'll sing for you
Yes I'll sing for you
What is in my heart
Let it ring through you

I'll sing for you
I'll sing for you
What is in my heart
Let it ring through you

I'll sing for you
I'll sing for you
I'll sing for you
I'll sing for you
I'll sing for you
I'll sing for you
