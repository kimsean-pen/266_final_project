You used to be the girl that set the world on fire
And they doused your soul in water but the flames reached higher
Used to act so tough like you could walk on a wire
And they called you devil's daughter, such a pretty liar
Yea
Yea

You were burning like the summer, crazy like a fox
You hit harder than a drummer, like a wave on the rocks
You could play me like the lotto, you were playing a part
There ain't nobody could tame you and your wild heart
Yea

Yea

Take me back
To those barefoot summer nights
Take me back
Running down those highway lights
Remember when
We said don't let go 'till we die
Take me back
To that fire in your eyes
'Cause I know it ain't gone too far
Take me back to you and to your wild heart

Yea
To your wild heart

Yea
You used to be the girl that could light up a room
And with the flip of a switch I bet you still do

You will leave a trail of danger yea wherever you go
And no matter where it lead me I would follow
Yea

Mm yea
You look beautiful in blue jeans, holes on the knees
You were smoking like a cigarette, I couldn't breathe
Used to rock around the ballroom, dance on the bar

Baby nobody could tame you and your wild heart
Take me back
To those barefoot summer nights
Take me back
Running down those highway lights
Remember when
We said don't let go 'till we die
Take me back

To that fire in your eyes
'Cause I know it ain't gone too far
Take me back to you and to your wild heart
Yea

To your wild heart
Yea
You used to be the girl that set the world on fire

And they doused your soul in water but the flames reached higher
You'll always be the one that keep me crazy inside
And if you got a wild heart don't you let it die
Take me back
To those barefoot summer nights
Take me back
Running down those highway lights
Remember when
We said don't let go 'till we die
Take me back
To that fire in your eyes
'Cause I know it ain't gone too far
Take me back to you and to your wild heart
Yea
To your wild heart
Yea
To your wild heart
To your wild heart
Yea
