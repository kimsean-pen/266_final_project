You can't find the phone
So you can call it off
But it might be for the best
You can't walk away, anyway
Because you've nowhere else to go

Is he worth all this?
Is it a simple yes?
Because if you have to think, it's fucked
Feels like you've loved him more
Than he loved you
And you wish you'd never met

Don't keel over now
Don't keel over
Don't keel over now
Don't keel over

You've been up all night
And the night before
And you've lost counts of drinks and time
And your friends keep calling, worried sick
And there's strangers everywhere

Don't keel over now
Don't keel over
Don't keel over now
Don't keel over

And in one little moment
It all implodes
This isn't everything you are

Breathe deeply in the silence
No sudden moves
This isn't everything you are

Just take the hand that's offered
And hold on tight
This isn't everything you are

There's joy not far from here
I know there is
This isn't everything you are

When you took the call
How could you know
That he'd slipped away last night
And you wish you went home days ago
To say goodbye, or just hello

Don't keel over now
Don't keel over
Don't keel over now
Don't keel over

And in one little moment
It all implodes
This isn't everything you are

Breathe deeply in the silence
No sudden moves
This isn't everything you are

Just take the hand that's offered
And hold on tight
This isn't everything you are

There's joy not far from here, right
I know there is
This isn't everything you are

This isn't everything you are
This isn't everything you are
