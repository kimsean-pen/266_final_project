Reason as to get excited
We're here watching the stars explode
Endured thunder and lightning
Just about to overload

And I can't get you off of my mind
No matter how I try
I can't get you off of my mind
No matter how I try

Time to get your hands dirty
Send no darkness, just beams of light
And as the planets are turning
In silent circles beyond your tide

And I can't get you off of my mind
No matter how I try
I can't get you off of my mind
No matter how I try

No matter
We all matter
We're all matter
Does it matter,
How we try?

And I can't get you off of my mind
No matter how I try
I can't get you off of my mind
No matter how I try

No matter
We all matter
We're all matter
Does it matter,
How we try?
How we try
