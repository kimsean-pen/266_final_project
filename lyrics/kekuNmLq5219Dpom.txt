Out on the street, I'm stalking the night,
I can hear my heavy breathing.
Paid for the kill but it doesn't seem right;
something there I can believe in .

Voices are calling from inside my head.
I can hear them, I can hear them,
vanishing memories of things that were said,
they can't try to hurt me now.

But a shot in the dark, one step away from you.
A shot in the dark, always creeping up on you

Taught by the powers that preach over me
I can hear their empty reason
I wouldn't listen I learnt how to fight
I opened up my mind to treason

But just like the wounded and when it's too late
They'll remember they'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now

But a shot in the dark one step away from you
A shot in the dark not a thing that you can do
A shot in the dark always creeping up on you

But just like the wounded and when it's too late
They'll remember they'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now

But a shot in the dark one step away from you
A shot in the dark not a thing that you can do
A shot in the dark always creeping up on you
