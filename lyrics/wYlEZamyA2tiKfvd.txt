Yeah, I said too much again
Yeah, I pushed too hard again
And I wanna start, but when
Always lose it in the end

Stupid once again
You wanna be my friend
And I'll push too hard again
Always lose it in the end

I don't know
How I can let you go
How will I let you go

Yo, yo
I keep my guards up
When it comes to the women
Told you that
Ever since the beginning
That's why I stand close
Down to white women
'Cause young girls are crazy
These are my limits

I can't let you go
And you know that
I can't see another man
Trying to blow that

That's critical
Love starts hurting me
Doctor Winslow said I need therapy

Torment, Misery
It's killing me physically
Why murder me legally
A love you can first leave

So I'ma close my eyes
And just pretend
'Cause word on the street's
I'ma lose it in the end

Yeah, I cared too much again
You stand to hard to care
And this must be a sin
Always lose it in the end

"Just chill out" is what you said
"Take a pill and go to bed"
No matter, how or when
I always lose it in the end

I don't know
How I can let you go
How will I let you go

I know what way to go when it
Comes to the ladies
'Cause things ain't changed
Since the early eighties
A few things first
I'm still picking them crazies
You wanna battle a court
Like Kim and Slim Shady

I ain't having that
No, I ain't having that
You just trying to get rich
Like Miramax
Forced my hand
Girl, to let you know
Because you know what starts
It's real unnatural

Yeah, I said too much again
Yeah, I pushed too hard again
And I wanna start, but when
Always lose it in the end

Stupid once again
You wanna be my friend
And I'll push too hard again
Always lose it in the end

I don't know
How I can let you go
How will I let you go
