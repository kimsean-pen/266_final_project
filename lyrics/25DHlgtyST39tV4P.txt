I'm on a trip
I can't get off
Can't get over
I want it all
I want it all
Inside of you
I call you up
You're getting off
I'm coming over
You're twenty-one
I see your eyes, you're barely sober
I hear your voice
You're calling out from me to you
I pour a drink, you move in quick
You're moving forward
Then you said
"No, whoa
I'm never gonna be inside of you"
And I said
"No, whoa
I'm never gonna see inside of you"
Because I know I'm gonna fall
And you'll be waiting for it all
Because I know, I know, I know
I can't get inside of you
Inside of you
This fragile game
It's like a train that's headed nowhere
It never stops
And I can't see the exit sign
We're headed north
I see the cliff, we're getting closer
Look out, baby
So don't say that you just want to runaway
Replay all the things that I tried to say
I'm twenty-one, so you're getting off
I'm coming over
Then you said
"No, whoa
I'm never gonna be inside of you"
And I said
"No, whoa
I'm never gonna see inside of you"
Because I know I'm gonna fall
And you'll be waiting for it all
Because I know, I know, I know
I can't get inside of you

Hey
I'm on a trip
I can't get off
Can't get over
I want it all
I want it all
Inside of you
I call you up
You're getting off
I'm coming over
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No, whoa
I'm never gonna be inside of you
And I said
"No, whoa
I'm never gonna see inside of you"
Because I know I'm gonna fall
And you'll be waiting for it all
Because I know, I know, I know
I can't get inside of you
Inside of you
I know I'm gonna fall
And you'll be waiting for it all
Because I know, I know, I know
I can't get inside of you
Inside of you
I'm on a trip
I can't get off
Can't get over
I want it all
I want it all
Inside of you
I call you up
You're getting off
I'm coming over
Yeah, yeah, yeah
