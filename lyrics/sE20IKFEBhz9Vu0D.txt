Is it in your skin, is it in your bones
All your honor undertow
And there it goes, the middle road
There goes everything untold

(ooohhh) for the love
(ooohhh) for the long run
(ooohhh) one by one, your favorite son

It was Arizona, the 17th
The howl of knowing what's underneath
And I'm so sorry I couldn't speak
So sweet

A symptom of the overrun
A blinder trust, the whole lump sum
A warmer room, a hallowed flood
A film, a page of what's to come

(ooohhh) for the love
(ooohhh) for the long run
(ooohhh) one by one, your favorite son

It was Arizona, the 17th
The howl of knowing what's underneath
And I'm so sorry I couldn't speak x3
So sweet
