Since I know how low to go
I wont let it show
Won't you touch me touch me, I won't let it go
And now I stand, and I peel for more.
Won't you touch me touch me, I won't let it go

Yes I've finally found a reason
I don't need an excuse
I've got this time on my hands
You are the one to abuse

Yes I've finally found a reason
I don't need an excuse
I've got this time on my hands
You are the one to abuse
One to abuse

You're always talking back to me
You won't let it be, won't you touch me touch me
It never bothered you before
Now I stand and I peel for more,
won't you touch me touch me, i wont let it go

Yes I've finally found a reason
I Don't need an excuse
I've got this time on my hands
You are the one to abuse

Yes I've finally found a reason

I've got this time on my hands
You are the one to abuse
