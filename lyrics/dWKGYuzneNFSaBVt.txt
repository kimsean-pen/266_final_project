People come on and do it right
Shake your behinds like a dynamite
Chuck all your worries and toss your thighs
To be tame is a pain when you realize

Ah, you gotta move
You gotta move
Oh, you gotta move
Oh, people gotta move
You gotta move

Shake all your brains and pump your heart
Show all the world what you are
You come on for right, you come on for wrong, you come on for zeal
'Cause the tones of your bones makes you feel

You gotta groove
You gotta groove
No, no, no, you gotta groove
Yeah, people gotta move
You gotta move

(Move, move)
You gotta move
(Move, move)
No, no, no, you gotta move
(Move, move)
Yeah, people gotta move
(Move, move)
You gotta move

Move, move
Move, move
Move, move
