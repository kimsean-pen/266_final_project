Yeah, you? re so convinced of how it? s supposed to be
I know that you? re confused, don? t take it out on me
We? re not afraid to try, we? re not afraid to dream
But when it all goes wrong we? re not afraid to scream

? Cause the future now is ours to make
Oh, oh, shout it out

Get ready? cause we like it loud
? Cause we were born to make some noise
Don? t tell me we should turn it down
? Cause we were born to make some noise
Make some noise, make some noise

We? re not the enemy you might be surprised
Don? t need hypocrisy to open up our eyes
We don? t need your rules, don? t need a uniform
This is who we are, we won? t be ignored

? Cause the future now is all that remains
Oh, oh shout it out

Get ready? cause we like loud
? Cause we were born to make some noise
Don? t tell me we should turn it down
? Cause we were born to make some noise

Nobody? s going to shut it down, yeah
? Cause we were born to make some noise
We could turn this whole thing around
Come on all you girls and boys make some noise
Make some noise, make some noise

Just for once, just for once can you think for yourself?
Seconds fade away so we don? t have anytime to waste

Get ready? cause we like loud
? Cause we were born to make some noise
Don? t tell me we should turn it down
? Cause we were born to make some noise

Nobody? s going to shut it down, yeah
? Cause we were born to make some noise
We could turn this whole thing around
Come on all you girls and boys make some noise

Get ready? cause we like loud
? Cause we were born to make some noise
Don? t tell me we should turn it down
? Cause we were born to make some noise

We could turn this whole thing around
Come on you girls and boys make some noise
