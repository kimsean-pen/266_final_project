My song it's coming, soon
Spend my day time, singing ...
My song it's coming, soon
So I'm waiting, I'll be waiting, for you
My love

My load ain't ... that I count me too
My key, my, ... all the things that I do
My time is coming, to
So I'm waiting, I'll be waiting, for you
My love

Whoa, will it stay?
Whoa, will it break, for me?

...all the song that's in me
The road they making, won't take me where I should be
My song is coming, soon
So I'm waiting, I'll be waiting
Always waiting, for you, my love.
