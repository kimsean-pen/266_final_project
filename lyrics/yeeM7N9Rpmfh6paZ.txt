I pack my things, time to get going
And hitched a ride into the ocean
Oh, I know I should get away, get away
I pack my shit, time to hit the road
And drove my car into a black hole
Oh, I know I should but I don't wanna change
I need to hold her, I need to touch her
I need to hold her, I need to touch her

They're shooting at me, grinning through their teeth
Not hitting a thing
Despite what it might mean, I'm not worrying
Grinning through my teeth

My winter lake house is freezing cold
And my polar bear don't do what he's told
Oh, I know I should get away, get away
I need to hold her, I need to touch her
I need to hold her, I need to touch her

They're shooting at me, grinning through their teeth
Not hitting a thing
Despite what it might mean, I'm not worrying
I'm not worrying
They're shooting at me, grinning through their teeth
Grinning through my teeth
