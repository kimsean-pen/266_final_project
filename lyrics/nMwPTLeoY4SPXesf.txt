You are the minority
We are the majority
Fuck your lies and fuck your greed
We are the majority
Shout out to the underpriv
Shout out to my family
Shout out to my family
Shout out to the mother fuckin' majority

Stand up to authority
Stand up to authority

Another policy to keep you on your knees
Another one in jail another young black male
He kinda look like me
A law you did not make is gonna seal your fate
Like you had no voice like you got no choice
But we the remedy

In the lies we trust
To survive we must
Because now you're one of us
They gonna cut you down
If you speak too much (If you speak too much boy)
Because now you're one of us

So what did you expect from us?
So what did you expect from us?
Let me get online

They gotta isolate, they gotta segregate this
Just to keep us down, to keep us broken down
To keep us on the streets
Another body is laying on the floor now
Tell everybody they better take their tone out
When talking about it and everything they saw
No justice no peace we at war with the law

In the lies we trust
To survive we must
Because now you're one of us
They gonna cut you down
If you speak too much
Because now you're one of us

Stand up or die on your knees

Stand up or die on your knees
Stand up while you're begging them begging them 'please'
Stand up or die on your knees
Stand up or fucking die on your knees

Stand up or die on your knees
Stand up while you're begging them begging them 'please'
Stand up or die on your knees
Stand up or fucking die on your knees

In the lies we trust
To survive we must
Because now you're one of us
They gonna cut you down
If you speak too much
Because now you're one of us

Stand up or die on your knees
Stand up while you're begging them begging them 'please'
Stand up or die on your knees
Stand up or fucking die on your knees

You are the minority
We are the majority
Fuck your lies and fuck your greed
We are the majority
