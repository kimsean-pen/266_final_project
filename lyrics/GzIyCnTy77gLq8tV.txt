I'm creeping your way
And these sheets aren't stopping me
Because I'm gonna meet you face to face
And I'm gonna start from your waist
Up through your navel
And we're approaching such a place

This is where we both get scared
This is where emotion flares
This is where we both prepare

Navigate me through your body, navigate me
Navigate me through your body, navigate
I love the way you talk on top of me
So navigate me through your body

I'm creeping your way
And these sheets aren't stopping me
That's right, it's quite simply
These sheets aren't stopping me
'Cause my mind's on a mission
And a mind on a mission
Is a mind that you just set free
I'm creeping your way, I'm creeping your...

This is where we both get scared
And this is where emotion flares
This is where we both prepare

Navigate me through your body, navigate me
Navigate me through your body, navigate
I love the way you talk on top of me
So navigate me

'Cause a mind on a mission
With enough ammuntion
And the right propositon
Is a mind that you might set free
'Cause a mind on a mission
With enough ammution
And the proper position
Is a mind that you just set free

I love the way you talk on top of me
So navigate me

Navigate me through your body, navigate me
Navigate me through your body, navigate
I love the way you talk on top of me
So navigate me

Navigate me through your body, navigate me
Navigate me through your body, navigate
I love the way you talk on top of me
So navigate me through your body

I'm creeping your way, I'm creeping your way...
