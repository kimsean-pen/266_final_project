I feel it in the way you touch me
I feel it in the way you speak
I feel it when your hands are on me
I feel it in your heartbeat

I can feel it in the air
You got your secret, baby, I don't care
I'm seeing hands in your hair
I can see it in the way you stare

Oh holy mother, you're a saint
You let my love go to waste
You left me fucked up, baby, in a fucked up place
Oh my God, I'm saved

I know you'll never be mine
I gave you patience and you took my time
Oh baby, now you wanna fight
You spent your money, but you took my heart

Oh holy mother, you're a saint
You let my love go to waste
You left me fucked up, baby, in a fucked up place
Oh my God, I'm saved

If you want me, honey, I don't wanna know
If you thinking, babe, you gotta let it go
If you're feeling sorry, I don't wanna know
If you think about me, baby, then don't
If you want me, honey, I don't wanna know
If you thinking, babe, you gotta let it go
If you're feeling sorry, I don't wanna know
If you think about me, baby, then don't

Oh holy mother, you're a saint
You let my love go to waste
You left me fucked up, baby, in a fucked up place
Oh my God, I'm saved
Oh holy mother, you're a saint
(Oh holy mother, you're a saint)
You let my love go to waste
(You let my love go to waste)
You left me fucked up, baby, in a fucked up place
Oh my God, I'm saved
