In my silence I would love to forget
But restitution hasn't come quite yet
And with one accord, I keep pushing forth
I stretch my heart to heal some more

It used to be all I'd want to learn
was wisdom, trust, and truth
But now all I really want to learn
Is forgiveness for you

As my seasons change I've now grown to know
When one's heart creates, one's soul doesn't owe
So I wash away stains of yesterday
then tempt my heart with love's display

Used to be only what to learn
was wisdom, trust and truth
Now all I really want to learn
Is forgiveness for you

Used to be only what to learn
was wisdom, trust and truth
Now all I really want to learn
Is forgiveness for you

Used to be only what to learn
was wisdom, trust and truth
Now all I really want to learn
Is forgiveness for you
