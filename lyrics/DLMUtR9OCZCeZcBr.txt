If you knew what can cut through
The terrible and pure
What can be saved?
Preserved in hearts, keep it close

We believe we have control
But time is terminal

The ache of our agony
Cutting through, let it sting

For nothing more may lie here
Cherish this weight
It's all that remains
If we're to go on
Let it stay

It's so tragic
Let it sink in

It's so tragic
Let it sink in

It's so tragic
Let it sink in

I don't know how this is supposed to be
Conquered and confined in
Clutching to memory

I don't know how this is supposed to be
Conquered and confined in
Clutching to memory

It's played out in silence
It's haunting
Can you feel it?
Reminders are mirrored
Reflecting
Can you feel it?

It's played out in silence
It's haunting
Can you feel it?
Reminders are mirrored
Reflecting
Can you feel it?

What comes to pass, when we dissolve?
Ultimate darkness, playing out silently
In hollow hours, bring it to light
Life has meaning here

Balancing The Dark

Strike, illustrate
Cease, every moment grey
I concur
Retracting these splinters
Take, navigate
Disarm, in cycles
Crawl on
I concur
Retracting these splinters
Etched always
Lasting, reacting
In movements so permanent
I concur
Retracting these splinters
Etched always
Lasting, undying
A score unmarked
There is no way to compose the unchartered and unknown
The concept of a world without, the severity of it all
To comprehend the fragility
Lost in the harshness of endless
Cursed by what will embody
Lost in the harshness of endless
The cruelty of that which is cherished
