In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying trying to make me stay
I said this time I've had enough
And you've called a hundred times but I'm not pickin' up
'Cause I'm so mad, I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles, screaming I'm in love with you
Wait there in the pourin' rain, come back for more!
And don't you leave 'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride sittin' here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over the things we both said
And I remember the slammin' door and all the things that I misread
So babe if you know everything tell me why you couldn't see
That when I left I wanted you to chase after me?

I said leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles, screaming I'm in love with you
Wait there in the pourin' rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door

And I scream out the window
I can't even look at you, I don't need you
But I do, I do, I do...
I see there's nothing you can't say
To make this right again
I mean it, I mean it, what I mean is

I said leave but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles, screaming I'm in love with you
Wait there in the pourin' rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door

With your face and your beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carry me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down cryin' was it worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything, I must confess I need you
