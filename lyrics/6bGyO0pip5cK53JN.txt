I've got something for you
And I can hardly breathe
Something draws me to you
It's taking over me

Dont know where you came from
But you're cutting deep
When the music's over
Will you come with me?

Tell me you can feel it
Though we're oceans apart
I've got a love for you
I've got a love for you
I know this magic sparks inside who we are
I've got a love for you
I've got a love for you

I've got a love for you

You
You
I've got a love for you
You
You
I've got a love for
I've got a love for you

I was hoping you could
Fix these broken seams
Floating through the puzzles
And the endless screens

Well I've got something for you
And it's cutting deep
Now the music's over
Will you come with me?

Tell me you can feel it
Though we're oceans apart
I've got a love for you
I've got a love for you
I know this magic sparks inside who we are
I've got a love for you
I've got a love for you

I've got a love for you
You
You
I've got a love for you
You
You
I've got a love for

Tell me you can feel it
Though we're oceans apart
I've got a love for you
I've got a love for you
I know this magic sparks inside who we are
I've got a love for you
I've got a love for you
