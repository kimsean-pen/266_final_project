Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me

She's saying that's okay
Hey baby do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need
She looked me deep in the eyes
She touchin' me so to start
She says there's no turnin' back
She trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Let me be!

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

She likes the boys in the bands
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan, after the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors, for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree

She's saying that's okay
Hey baby do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I wanna go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star

Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Diana!
Diana!
Dirty Diana!
It's Dia-aa-aa... come on!

She said I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleepin alone
Why don't you come with me
I said my baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright
Diana walked up to me
She said I'm all yours tonight
At that I ran to the phone
Sayin' baby I'm alright
I said but unlock the door
Because I forgot the key
She said he's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me

Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana

Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!

Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!

Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
