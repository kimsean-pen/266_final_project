I spend the night, yeah, doing ninety in a sixty five
Ignore the lights 'til I'm by your side
Because when you take this out on me my knees get weak
With that heart of kryptonite

I stole the moon
I made the stars align
And I showed you how to fly
And you made me the bad guy

You paint the scene with the colors of an enemy
All over me, and for your friends to see
I took just one misstep and now I'm hanging by my feet
Out of sight and out of reach

I stole the moon
I made the stars align
I showed you how to fly
And you made me the bad guy
I fought for you
I kept you safe at night
I would have risked my life
And you made me the bad guy

You made me the bad guy
You made me the bad guy
Yeah, you made me the bad guy

Guess I forgot, guess I forgot
History repeats
Once lost and found, once lost and found,
We're too blind to see
Just show me how, just show me how the villain is me

And I stole the moon
I made the stars align
I showed you how to fly
And you made me the bad guy
When I fought for you
I kept you safe at night
I would have risked my life
And you made me the bad guy

You made me the bad guy
Now do they even know
You made me the bad guy
Ha, got it
You made me the bad guy
