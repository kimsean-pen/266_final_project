Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, but still you forget
Ohhh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

Too old to lose it, but you're too young to choose it
And your clock waits so patiently on your song
Well you walk past the cafe but you don't eat,
When you've lived too long

Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
Chev brakes are snarling, as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead
So you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow

Don't let the milk float, ride your mind
They're so natural, religiously unkind
Oh no, love, you're not alone
You're watching yourself, but you're too unfair
You got your head all
tangled up
But if I could only make
you care
Oh no, love, you're not alone

No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, now I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone
Just, turn on with me
And you're, not alone
Give me your hands
Cause you're, wonderful
Just give me your hands
Cause you're, wonderful
Give me your hands
Cause you're, wonderful
Oh, give me your hands...
