So loud
So loud
Slow down
Slow hound

They want to conquer you
Abandon you
I want to burden you
Belong to you

So loud
So loud
Slow down
Slow hound

So loud
So loud
Slow down
Slow hound

They want to think for you
Pour drinks into you
They want to look at you
While I look everywhere for you

So loud
So loud
Slow down
Slow hound

So loud
So loud
Slow down
Slow hound

I want to sever you
Defend against you
I want to speak for you
As if I know what you'll do
