My shoes
They took me for a walk
I guess
We walked a hundred blocks
When it was time to go back
We were getting off the tracks
They said
'Just one more cigarette'
A drink or two would not be bad
My shoes
They took me to a bar
Quite soon
I said
'We're in a trap, we are'
One shot made me feel brand new
Two and all I thought was you

Dancing, dancing
Dreaming of a neon light
Dancing, just dancing
I've got you deep inside of my mind

How sad
Is a dancer on his own?
Too bad
The steps they all seem wrong
One shot just made me feel blue
Two, I'm getting through with you
One day
I hope I might be right
One night
Like any other night
Your shoes will take you for a walk
And they will lead to my door

Dancing, dancing
Dreaming of a neon light
Dancing, just dancing
I've got you deep inside of my mind

Dancing, dancing
Dreaming of a neon light
deep inside of my mind

Dancing, just dancing
Dreaming of a neon light
Dancing, just dancing
