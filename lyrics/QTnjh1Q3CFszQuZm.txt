Born to lose
Prophetic tattoo
An animal in a zoo
You won't get out anytime soon

Dead eyes and a mouth that can't speak clean
I can only imagine where that dirty mouth is when it's not on me
Animals know not what they do

Dead eyes, why such vulgarity?
I often imagine drowning in your skin, exactly where you end and my faults begin
