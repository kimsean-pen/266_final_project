Back in the summer
You said it was cracked
But you didn't want it
But you wanted it back
And the air is no good here
But you think you'll come back
And you needed a door way
And you needed to see
What happens when you give yourself back to me
And you'll rest on a moon beam
And hope no-one sees

Oh your
Tears, tears, tears of joy
Tears, tears, tears of joy
Well I'm holding you out
And I'm ready to stay
If you gave me your heart
I'm ready oh oh I'm ready for it

And the concert halls screaming
You took a bow
From the floor to the ceiling
The curtain came down
And I wrote all my dreams in
The dust on the ground
Forget that old future
The future is dead
I'll twist and turn all
The thoughts in your head
Until you feel seasick
While you're laid on your bed

Drying all of those
Tears, tears, tears of joy
Tears, tears, tears of joy
Well I'm holding you out
And I'm ready to stay
If you gave me your heart
I'm ready oh oh I'm ready for it

It's never gonna be the same
If it was easy would you feel this way
Now there's nothing left for us to do
Except for you to be good to me
And me be good to you

Tears, tears, tears of joy
Tears, tears, tears of joy
Well I'm holding you out
And I'm ready to stay
If you gave me your heart
I'm ready oh oh I'm ready for it
I'm ready oh oh I'm ready for it
I'm ready oh oh I'm ready for it
