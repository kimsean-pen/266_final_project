Oh this is it
Time's running out
This is the end
They've found the house
Close the curtains
On the move
There's snipers on the neighbours roofs
Do you know that I loved you more than anything else
Help 'em barricade the door
That's five more minutes to ourselves

Well this is it what if I say they killed our bodyguards
Well this is it what if I say they're all around
Well this is it what if I say that our bodyparts will never be found

Well, I am not a seer
But we will never make it out of here

Well this is it
It's hard to tell
But then again, oh what the hell
Close the curtains, dim the lights
I mean this is a special night
Would you please let me love you for the very last night
Help 'em barricade the doors
It makes no sense to cry

Well this is it what if I say they killed our bodyguards
Well this is it what if I'd say they're up the stairs
Well this is it what if I say that
our bodyparts will forever be theirs

If you think our dying is rightful
Go fire your rifles
It makes no sense to run
All the damage is done
And we might just as well have some fun
When we're finally on the floor
The first bullets hit the door
There is blood on your skin
There's the squad squalling in
There are things that end how they begin
