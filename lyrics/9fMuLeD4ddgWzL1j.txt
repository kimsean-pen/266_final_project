My face to the sky
Dreaming about just how high
I could go... and if I know
When I finally get there
Taking off my glasses

Sun pokes through my lashes
And somehow I know
There's a time for every star to shine...

Everybody got their something
Make you smile like an itty bitty child
Everybody got their something
Everybody got their something

Hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey hey

People keeping score
So ya better hurry up and get yours
Cause somebody else
Got your spot
Before you even dropped

Seek and you shall find
Everything in my own sweet time
I'll take my chances
With what I believe is only mine...

Busy holding on
So the roof don't fly
Keep you from moving on
So get it right
Turn the tide over
Like a love song
Like a butterfly
Believe me if you hand it over
You'll come out ... all right
Yeah

Everybody got their something
Make you smile, like an itty bitty child
Everybody got their something
Everybody got their something

Hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey heey
Hey hey hey hey hey hey heeeeey
Uh huh
Uh huh

Illuminate the silly things
Shed some light on all that's wrong
Everybody need it... sometime
Sometimes the only thing you got is what makes...
You... feel like you're something else ... altogether
You have everything
You don't need another reason to be something
I've been on a ride
And caught up in the landslide
But I'm gonna spread my wings and fly...
High high high high high high
High high high high high high high...
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hooo
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoooohoo
Everybody got their something
Everybody got their something
Make you smile, like an itty bitty child
Everybody got their something
Everybody got their something
Hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey hey
Everybody got their something
Everybody got their something
Make you smile, like an itty bitty child
Everybody got their something
Everybody got their something

Hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey hey heeey...

There's a time for every star
There's a time for every star
There's a time for every star
There's a time for every star
There's a time for every star
There's a time for every star
There's a time for every star
There's a time for every star
