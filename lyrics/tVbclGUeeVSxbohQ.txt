Make a face at the taste
Can you take another cigarette?
Can you, can you, can you, can you, can you? (Can you?)
Let you have it, hold it
Trace the edge, unfold it
Hold it, hold it
All the songs that were made
Just to imitate
Were fake but true
You wouldn't know it
You were pushing, pulling
Till the sky was falling in

Undone by the fascination
Sun come and golden
Take me over (over)
Overtake me too
Master over you
Undone by the fascination
Sun come and golden
Take me over (over)
Overtake me too
Master over you

Take it from
The same way
We're gonna die

Another dynamic in place
Could you catch another silhouette?
Could you, could you, could you, could you, could you? (Could you?)
Let you have it, hold it
Trace the edge, unfold it
Hold it, hold it
If the space is left blank on its face
Does it just equal one?
Or none?
You wouldn't know it
Let the moment slow it
While your head
Keeps growing in

Undone by the fascination
Sun come and golden
Take me over (over)
Overtake me too
Master over you
Undone by the fascination
Sun come and golden
Take me over (over)
Overtake me too
Master over you
Undone by the fascination
Sun come and golden
Take me over (over)
Overtake me too
Master over you
