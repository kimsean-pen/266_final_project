New city, running on a rush hour high
We bought a ticket on the first damn flight
Walking these streets, we got no clue where we are
But I don't care
No, I don't care

December drinkin' with a seaside view
It'll be our secret, all we get up to
We fought it all but standin' here we're good
And we don't care
No, we don't care

Because I could try, but nothin' feels this good
By your side, no, nothing comes close to
You and I and the orange skies
No, nothing comes close to
Nothing comes close to

You and I
Woah, oh, it's the crazy kind
You and I
Woah, oh, it's the crazy kind
Might not be much but it's all I know
You and I
Woah, oh, it's the crazy kind

Surrendered sleep so that we'd see it all
Hungover, walking through the city walls
Lookin' at me like we're invicible
I feel that too
I feel that too

I adore the way you say that I'm yours, babe
You dress it pretty in your East London way
But don't lose this moment thinkin' about home
I'm right here with you
Always with you

Because I could try but nothin' feels this good
By your side, no, nothing comes close to
You and I and the orange skies
No, nothing comes close to
Nothing comes close to

You and I
Woah, oh, it's the crazy kind
You and I
Woah, oh, it's the crazy kind
Might not be much but it's all I know
You and I
Woah, oh, it's the crazy kind

Ooh, we got the habit they all wanna touch
We're hooked up on this crazy love
We got the habit they all wanna touch
And I'm always actin' crazy when it's

You and I
Whoa oh
You and I
Woah oh
Might not be much but it's all I know
You and I
Woah, oh, it's the crazy kind

You and I
Woah, oh, it's the crazy kind
You and I
Woah, oh, it's the crazy kind
Might not be much but it's all I know
You and I
Woah, oh, it's the crazy kind
You and I
Woah, oh, it's the crazy kind
You and I
Woah, oh, it's the crazy kind
Might not be much but it's all I know
You and I
Woah, oh, it's the crazy kind
