Bottles in the backpack, bikes in the front

Real bad mamacita with the Henny in her cup
Hella patriotic with that flag on her on butt
Hopped on my handle bars and she passed me the blunt
Yea we getting high on the West Side
Like everywhere we go
Homies on probation so we duckin' 5-0

Feeling like a firework bitch i'm bouta blow
They love me everywhere, everywhere that I go
