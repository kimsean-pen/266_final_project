Tell me - who's gonna fall
I've been underneath
The weight of it all
Nights get heavy stumble badly down
To the street
Where we're headed all this pavement pounds
But you're asleep
I'm down in the place where you left me
I know everyone in this town
You call and you talk to me calmly
You're out with the sound of a crowd
I'm faded in someone's apartment
You'll wake to a ghost on the wall
I'll stop when I know how it started
I'll drop with the weight of it all
Tell me, where have you been
You've been underneath
Still digging in
Broken pieces we will rise again
From the dirt
No not beaten even buildings bend
For what it's worth
You're down in the place where I left you
You're out with your strange new friends
You tell me the way what you've been through
You're lost and you love it again
You're faded in someone's apartment
I'll wake to a ghost on the wall
You'll stop when you know how it started
You'll drop with the weight of it all
If all my best is yet to come could we forget the last six months
I'm pulling myself together
Roads to oceans let's retrace the moments I had half erased
I'm going to be better
I'm down in the place where you left me
I know everyone in this town
You call and you talk to me calmly
You're out with the sound of a crowd
I'm faded in someone's apartment
You'll wake to a ghost on the wall
I'll stop when I know how it started
I'll drop with the weight of it all
I'll drop with the weight of it all
I'll drop with the weight of it all
I'll drop with the weight of it all
