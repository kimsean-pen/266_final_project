There is no end
Don't be alarmed
You'll make it, still
Inside you're peaceful
And though you're gone through the door
Holding up the window
All of the time you came so long
All love they're stories
Just like the ' in the war
Then, what place is new?
You'd better fall and wonder off
You space out of love
Wondering how, wondering why
Filled up their heads with
Every piece and empty thought
And all I knew of
That is from God, I trashed it all
Where, when can we be
Certain of how it came to be?
You space out of love
Wondering how, wondering why
