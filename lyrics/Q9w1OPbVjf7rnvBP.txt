Total confusion- one final sin
Someone's religion and greed
Accidents happen, someone to blame
Who's got the answers we need?

I don't know who to believe
But I know who's gonna set me free
Cause I'll be waiting

When heaven comes down

Ashes to ashes, sorrow and shame
Look at the future again

Angels in heaven walking the streets
Searching for someone to blame

I don't know who to believe
But I know who's gonna set me free
Cause I'll be waiting

When heaven comes down
Until tomorrow
When heaven comes down

Cause I'll be waiting
When heaven comes down
Until tomorrow
When heaven comes down
