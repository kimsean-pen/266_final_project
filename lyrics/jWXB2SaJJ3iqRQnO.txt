From your lips it's spreading like a rash
I wanted to refute you, I'd rather tie you to the mast
So put away your razor blades, disconnect the taser
Overstuff your suitcase and I'll untie your shoe laces

It's ok, you've had a lot to say
I can't hear you out on the dunes
It's alright, I made it out alive
But bleeding out into the blue

In another life I'd beat you to the punch
To the ministry of scoundrels you're just another number crunch
It's ok, you've had a lot to say
I can't hear you out on the dunes
It's alright, you made it out alive
But bleeding out into the blue

I default to the high road, it suits me all too well
But I'll allow a detour so you can go to hell
So sugar coat your demons and camouflage your theft
I'll water down your venom until there's nothing left

It's ok, you've had a lot to say
I can't hear you out on the dunes
It's alright, we made it out alive
But bleeding out into the blue
It's okay, you're gonna wash away and I'm gonna walk out on you
It's alright, it's alright
You're bleeding out into the blue
