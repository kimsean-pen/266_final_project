Drivin hard through your friend
Gotta find a way to mend
The less we see, the more it grows
Festering out of control

Piled high
You get that face, i wonder why
We ever got it together

What's to say
Just no clue, we just know what to do
Hope it comes together

It's the norm, float again
It's the stuff you said you send
Take it in, wait to see
If its enough, just 'cause it's free

Push too far
Feel the skin begin to scar
Can't really put it together

Now it's a drag
With no hope of coming back
How can you ever get it together?

[solo]

Bottled up, stored away
Always ready to give way
Push it farther, yeah we know
Clinging, hoping it won't show

Piled high
You get that face, i wonder why
We ever got it together

Push too far
Feel the skin begin to scar
Can't really pull it together

About to crack
With no hope of coming back
How can you ever get it together

What's to say
Just no clue, we just know what we do
Hope it comes together
