I broke free on a Saturday morning
I put the pedal to the floor
Headed north on Mills Avenue
And listened to the engine roar

My broken house behind me
And good things ahead
A girl named Cathy
Wants a little of my time
Six cilinders underneath the hood
Crashing and kicking
Aha!

Listen to the engine wine
I am going to make it through this year
If it kills me

I am going to make it though this year
If it kills me
I played video games in a drunken haze

I was seventeen years yound
Hurt my knuckles punching the machines
The taste of scotch rich on my tongue

And then Cathy showed up
And we hung out
Trading swigs from a bottle

All bitter and clean
Locking eyes
Holding hands

Twin high maintenance machines
I am going to make it through this year
If it kills me
I am going to make it though this year
If it kills me
I drove home in the California dusk
I could feel the alcohol inside of me hum
Pictured the look on my stepfather's face
Ready for the bad things to come

I downshifted
As I pulled into the driveway

The motor screaming out
Stuck in second gear
The scene ends badly
As you might imagine
In a cavalcade of anger and fear
There will be feasting and dancing
In Jerusalem next year
I am going to make it through this year
If it kills me
I am going to make it though this year
If it kills me
