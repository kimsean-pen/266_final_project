Sun Goes Up
Inna

Sun goes up
Everybody move your body
Sun goes up
Everybody after party
Sun goes up
Everybody move your body
Sun goes up, come light

Four'o'clock in the morning, time to party
Time to let it out
Wanna dance to the sunlight
And I know you'll join me tonight

I wanna feel it, I wanna feel it tonight
I wanna feel it, I wanna feel it so tight

Tell me where's the party, tell me where it went
Just wanna keep it going 'til 4am
And we are gonna do it, gonna do it all again
Oh, when the sun goes up
Move, let it go so tell me what you like
And come and give it to me, cause it feels so right
I gotta do it, gotta do it all again

Sun goes up
Everybody move your body
Sun goes up
Everybody after party
Sun goes up
Everybody move your body
Sun goes up, come light

I wake up feeling hazy
It's so crazy
Do it all again
Went and danced and it's over
And I need you, join me tonight

I wanna feel it, I wanna feel it tonight
I wanna feel it, I wanna feel it so tight

Tell me where's the party, tell me where it went
Just wanna keep it going 'til 4am
And we are gonna do it, gonna do it all again
Oh, when the sun goes up
Move, let it go so tell me what you like
And come and give it to me, cause it feels so right
I gotta do it, gotta do it all again

Sun goes up
Everybody move your body
Sun goes up
Everybody after party
Sun goes up
Everybody move your body
Sun goes up, come light

Tell me where's the party, tell me where it went
Just wanna keep it going 'til 4am
And we are gonna do it, gonna do it all again
Oh, when the sun goes up
Move, let it go so tell me what you like
And come and give it to me, cause it feels so right
I gotta do it, gotta do it all again

Sun goes up
Everybody move your body
Sun goes up
Everybody after party
Sun goes up
Everybody move your body
Sun goes up, come light
