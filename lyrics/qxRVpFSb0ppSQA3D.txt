I promise that I'll hold you when it's cold out
When we loose our winter coats in the spring
'Cause lately I was thinking I never told you
That every time I see you my heart sings

'Cause we lived at the carnival in summer
We scared ourselves to death on a ghost train
And just like every ferris wheel stops turning
Oh I guess we had an expiration date
So I won't say I love you, it's too late

'Cause every time I saw you I got nervous
Shivering and shaking at the knees
And just like every song I haven't heard yet, no
I didn't know the words in front of me
In front of me

Oh, but I don't wanna know
Who will take you home
Who will take you home
Who will take you home

And now that you're on someone else's shoulders
The winter winds are colder on my own
Maybe we will meet when we get older
So I won't say I love you if you don't

So I won't say I love you if you
