No crickets, no creatures are a stirring
On the last night of the Chinese year
I need a warm hand over the water
Ever since I lost mine (fireworks disaster)

Now [Unknown] quite awake
Gonna take my life
Gonna take my life back one day

Now I'm watching you changing the mirror
And I'm unable to move
When all my girlfriends appear in the doorway
I don't know how they got here
I don't know what to say about this

And they all go that way
Gonna take my life
Gonna take my life back one day
