Revelation, like the pavement hitting your face
Feel it sinking in
I've been running from the shadows
Here I am, here I am

My reflection is the blackest black
Where's the lie?
What's the sense in turning back?
Here I am

1982
1982
1982
1982

I've been running from this shadow, here I am
I'm a different man
I've been staring at this sun now, here I am
I'm a different man
Running
1982

I've been running
