In the house of lords
We control the movement
Of your limbs
There is endless beauty
In the might that we possess
Dragons are creatures
Of (our) own imagination
And dragons... Dragons breathe fire

We throw stones in the water
And see the waves
That we create

We push - Push hard
Predatorial instinct, built for the kill

Commando - Stones in the water
Commando - The Age of Nero

Keep looking for morning
In the shelter of night
(While) we renew our strength
Transfusing my blood

New layers to the core
I am ready now
As the world kneels

We push - Push hard
Predetorial instinct, built for the kill

Commando - Stones in the water
Commando - The Age of Nero
