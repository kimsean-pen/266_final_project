in the breathless hush of
four am
in the dark sits a sad cliche'
cloaked in the navy blu of slowly
fading stars

tell me how this came to be
sleeplessness talk to me
she'd say over and over again

fumbling through a cut glass vase
passing lipstick and cotton spools
burning jealous pictures of
marriages of friends

you never asked to be
the glutton of sympathy
she says over and and over that this is
the end

'cause i see it in her eyes
what you don't know, time to let go
i see it in your eyes there is so
much more out there to be learned

such mornful words
on this white snow
vacant page all the lesson
that she learns she packs away

will you never cease to be
the glutton of sympathy
she writes over and over again

that's when i see it in your eyes
what you don't know time to let go
i see it in your eyes
there is so much more out there to
be learned

tossing, turning roll away
indecision won't you ever make up
your mind
lifetime nighttime wake the day
'cause tomorrow will see
if you've had your fill of sympathy

will you never cease to be
the glutton of sympathy
don't you know the stars are all
fading let the sunshine capture the sparkle of
your smile
