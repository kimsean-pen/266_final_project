I see you praying on the dancefloor
See you moving so inspired
It's got me wondering what you're asking for
Why your soul is setting fires
See, I've been trying locked doors
It's getting kind of tired
Like a lot of a people wanting more
Reach for carrot, wanna bite

(You see) Right now
(Have a) Right now
(The moment) Right now
So don't hold time

Revolution, evolution
Rolling back the status quo
How the pace of evolution
Often seems a little slow
But the breath between us precede
The nothing there to show
It's the infinite and finite
If you want it, let her know

(Saying) Right now
(Praying) Right now
(The moment) Right now
It's all a flow

(Saying) Right now
(Praying) Right now
(The moment) Right now
Come on, let go

Falling into the all-at-once
Letting go of the things they taught
Had me thinking about the nature of one
And imaginary need for the silly little things
Pass it right now, right now, the right now, love
Let go of the false alarms
Embrace all the [?]
Had me thinking about the nature of one
And imaginary need for the silly little dream
Pass it right now

There's a golden light that's right here
There's no bottom to this well
Wealth of loving, wealth of ideas
Peace of mind beyond the self

Breathe in the moment and it magnifies our love
Even the soul, even the soul
