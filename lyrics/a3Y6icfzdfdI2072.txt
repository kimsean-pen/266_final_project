I wonder what it's like to be loved by you
I wonder what its like to be home
And I don't walk when there's a stone in my shoe
All I know, that in time I'll be fine

I wonder what it's like to fly so high
Or to breathe under the sea
I wonder if someday I'll be good with goodbyes
But I'll be okay if you come along with me

Such a long, long way to go
Where I'm going I don't know
I'm just following the road
For a walk in the sun
For a walk in the sun

I wonder how they put a man on the moon
I wonder what it's like up there
I wonder if you'll ever sing this tune
All I know is the answer's in the air

Such a long, long way to go
Where I'm going I don't know
I'm just following the road
For a walk in the sun
For a walk in the sun

Sitting and watching the world going by
Is it true when we die we go up to the sky?
Woah, woah
So many things that I don't understand
Burnt my feet in the sand when I'm walking in the sun
Woah
Walking in the sun

Such a long, long way to go
Where I'm going I don't know
I'm just following the road
For a walk in the sun
For a walk in the sun, yeah
Woah
Woah
Woah
