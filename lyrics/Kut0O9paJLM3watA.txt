You can try to put me down
Hit me, as you never did before
Watch me bleeding on the ground
See now, how I stand up screaming for some more
Every hurt that you caused
Made me feel I am stronger than you all
Every tear that I cried all alone
And awake in the night
Every time that you spit out your lies, oh!
My world was falling down
Now it's time to leave it all behind
Eye to eye, we close it here tonight (Eye to eye, we close it here tonight)
Yes we close it here and then goodbye
Break the silence, screaming loud
I'm the angel of revenge, no more crying
I'm turning from the ashes to a new life
Look into my eyes and realize
Now I'm back and I am here to stay
The day you turn, looking at your past
Remember me and those friends who by then will be gone
And remember the scars that you've drawn on my skin and on my soul
Where have all we gone? Ghosts of your past days
Eye to eye, we closed it on that night (Eye to eye, we closed it on that night)
Yes we closed it there and then goodbye
Break the silence, screaming loud
I'm the angel of revenge, no more crying
I'm turning from the ashes to a new life
Look into my eyes and realize
Now I'm back and I am here to stay
And after all
We have one life
One run to go we can't rewind
What we have done
We are like leaves
On an old tree
Exposed to wind in a stormy fall
While the yellow slowly colors our lives
Break the silence, screaming loud
I'm the angel of revenge, no more crying
Turning from the ashes to a new life
Look into my eyes and realize
Now I'm back and I am here to stay
I am here to stay
'Cause I'm the chosen one
I am here to stay
