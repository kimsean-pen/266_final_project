So you live in the bottom of the sea,
and you kill all that come near you...
but you are very lonely, because all the other fish fear you
and you crave companionship and someone to call your own
because for the whole of your life you've been living alone.

On a black day in a black month at the black bottom of the sea
your mother gave birth to you and died immediately...
'Cos you can't have two killers living in the same pad
and when your mother knew that her time had come
she was really rather glad.

Death in the sea, death in the sea,
somebody please come and help me, come and help me
Fishes can't fly, fishes can't fly,
fishes can't and neither can I, neither can I...

Now I'm really rather like you for I've killed all the love I ever had
by not doing all I ought to and by leaving my mind coming bad.
And I too am a killer, for emotion runs as deep as flesh;
and I too am so lonely, and I wish that I could forget
we need love,
we need love,
we need love.
