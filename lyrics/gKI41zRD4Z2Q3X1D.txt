Thinkin' about the good times, baby
Remembering the bad
Memories of woken dreams only make me sad

I keep fooling myself now, baby
I got myself to blame
I shoulda known better, girl
'Cause trouble is your middle name

Trouble, trouble
Trouble is your middle name
Trouble, trouble
Trouble is your middle name

Too soon to know now, babe
Too soon to tell
Where you gonna take me, girl?
Heaven or hell?

I keep fooling myself now, baby
It's always the same
You're no angel of mercy
And trouble is your middle name

Trouble, trouble
Trouble is your middle name
Trouble, trouble
Trouble is your middle name

Trouble is your middle name
Trouble is your middle name
Trouble is your middle name
Trouble is your middle name

I shoulda known better

Thinking about the good times, baby
Remembering the bad
Memories of broken dreams only make me mad
I've been fooling myself now, baby
I got myself to blame
I shoulda known better, girl
'Cause trouble is your middle name

Trouble, trouble
Trouble is your middle name
Trouble, trouble
Trouble is your middle name
Trouble, trouble
Trouble is your middle name
Trouble, trouble
Trouble is your middle name

Trouble
Trouble is your middle name
Trouble
Trouble is your middle name
Trouble
Trouble is your middle name
Trouble, trouble
Trouble is your middle name
