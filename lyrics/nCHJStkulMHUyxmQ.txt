You know the way before you walk again
Our time is nigh, damning any sense
We have the key to anything you want
We're in too far

Close up
Close up

Fuzz in, fuzz out: television lines
It's now the time for secret hearts to marry
'Cause summer's gone, can't change again
The darkness in your eyes

And you were close
To what you wanted
