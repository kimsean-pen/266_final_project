We've been here too long tryin' to get along
Pretendin' that you're oh, so shy
I'm a natural ma'am doin' all I can
My temperature is runnin' high

Cry at night no one in sight
An' we got so much to share

Do you wanna touch?

Every girl an' boy needs a little joy
All you do is sit an' stare
Beggin' on my knees baby, won't you please?
Run your fingers through my hair

My, my, my whiskey and rye
Don't it make you feel so fine
Right or wrong don't it turn you on
Can't you see we're wastin' time, yeah?
