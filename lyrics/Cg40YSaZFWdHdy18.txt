You're ruling the way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can rescue me
This is my prayer

If you were mine
If you were mine
I wouldn't want to go to heaven

I cherish the day
Won't go astray
Won't be afraid
Won't catch me running
You're ruling the way that I move
You take my air

Show me how deep love can be

You're ruling the way that I move
I breathe your air
You only can rescue me
Rescue me
This is my prayer

I cherish the day
Won't go astray
Won't be afraid
Won't catch me running
Ah
I cherish the day
Won't go astray
Won't be afraid
Won't run away
Oh-oh

Show me how deep love can be
Show me how deep love can be
This is my prayer

Cherish the day
Won't go astray
Won't be afraid
Won't run away
Won't shy

Cherish the day
Won't go astray
(ah-ah) I won't be afraid darling as long as I'm with you

I cherish the day
I cherish the day
I cherish the day
I cherish the day
I cherish the day
Cherish the day
Cherish the day
Oh yeah
(oh yeah)
Cherish the day
I cherish the day
Cherish the day
Oh yeah
(oh yeah)
Oh yeah
Cherish the day
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
