Girlfriend, boyfriend
Always together
Girlfriend, boyfriend
Broke up, whatever
Girlfriend, boyfriend
And they hate each other
Girlfriend, boyfriend
I thought we would be forever

Love is dead, love is dead
Not love, make war
Love is dead, love is dead
Not love, make war
Love is dead, love is dead
Not love, make war
Love is dead, love is dead
Not love, make war

You-m-m-m
(Love is dead, love is dead)
You-m-m-m
(Love is dead, love is dead)
You-m-m-m
(Love is dead, love is dead)
Love is dead

Girlfriend, boyfriend
Never together
Girlfriend, boyfriend
Made up forever
Girlfriend, boyfriend
And they hate each other
Girlfriend, boyfriend
I thought we would be forever

Love is dead, love is dead
Not love, make war
Love is dead, love is dead
Not love, make war
Love is dead, love is dead
Not love, make war
Love is dead, love is dead
Not love, make war

You-m-m-m
Love is dead, love is dead
Love is dead, love is dead
Love is dead, love is dead
Love is dead, love is dead
You-m-m-m
(Love is dead, love is dead)
You-m-m-m
(Love is dead, love is dead)
You-m-m-m
(Love is dead, love is dead)
