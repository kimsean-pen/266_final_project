Pick us up we're all by ourselves
The great big howling is about to begin
A thousand miles from where it all begins

Old world, the whole world is

Going on and on (forfeit the shape to fit)
The backhand to a touch is moving on again
Going on and on

What's next?
I'm out of time
Losing my touch I can't feel
Speak for me
Do you see the same signs?
Do you know how to read between the lines?
All in all, it's all or none, all for one
What you want?

Pick us out of a lineup
Stranded and strange just as innocent as kids
The found are leaving and they're trying to forget
The old world, the whole world is

Going on and on (forfeit the shape to fit)
A backhand to the touch is moving on again
Going on and on

What's next?
I'm out of time
Losing my touch I can't feel
Speak for me
Do you see the same signs?
Do you know how to read between the lines?
All in all, it's all or none, all for one
What you want?

Going on and on
