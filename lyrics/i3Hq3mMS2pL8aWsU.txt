In waves, we were born into the reckoning
In death, you will hear it when the tide sings
Red sails, set until the very end
Blood stains, this is my revenge

Will I find the answer, or will I fall at their feet
This time I'm unable, to rest the anger within me
They gave their lives for a debt that's mine
So I'll give them a life remembered

No surrender, no survivors
This won't make it right but it will end their lives
No surrender, no survivors
This won't make it right but it will end their lives

So hold tight, make way, our final fight is today

In waves, we were born into the reckoning
In death, you will hear it when the tide sings
Red sails, set until the very end
Blood stains, this is my revenge

Blood spilled upon these live
Will bring us closer to the sun

No surrender, no survivors
This won't make it right but it will end their lives
No surrender, no survivors
This won't make it right but it will end their lives

So hold tight, make way, our final fight is today

In waves, we were born into the reckoning
In death, you will hear it when the tide sings
Red sails, set until the very end
Blood stains, this is my revenge

In waves, we were born into the reckoning
In death, you will hear it when the tide sings

Red sails, set until the very end
Blood stains, this is my revenge
