Nothing is perfect, but your imperfections are quaint
And your love is worth it and for that I will wait
And though you hate me when you have a turn
I drive you crazy, but you always return

If I fall short, if I break rank
It's a bloodsport, but I understand
I am all yours, I am unmanned
I'm on all fours, willingly damned

Loving you's a bloodsport
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fighting in a love war
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Although you love me, sometimes we're mean
Things can get ugly, but we're still a team
We are an army, that breaks from within, but
That's why we're stronger, and that's how we'll win

If I fall short, if I break rank
It's a bloodsport, but I understand
I am all yours, I am unmanned
I'm on all fours, willingly damned

Loving you's a bloodsport
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fighting in a love war
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's not what I'm in love for, I'm yours
But I don't know if you can help it
Maybe I'm just being selfish

Loving you's a bloodsport
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I've got your back
And though it's stacked against us
I've got your hand
It's us against consensus
And I will burn
The people who hurt you the worst and I will not learn
'Cause I am too young and too dumb to consider the terms
Of breaking the law and I'll curse the day that they return

With a smile on my face as their heads hit the floor
And they're done now, it's curtains
The bloodlust's a clusterfuck, it hurts but it's working
And even if you ask me to stop, it's too late
Because I've already decided their fate
It's not a distaste, it's pure hate and it pulsates
And it works its way around my brain anyway, what I'm trying to say
I'll protect you 'til the day I meet my maker
So don't fight me now 'cause you might need me later

Loving you's a bloodsport
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fighting in a love war
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's not what I'm in love for, I'm yours
But I don't know if you can help it
Maybe I'm just being selfish

Loving you's a bloodsport
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
