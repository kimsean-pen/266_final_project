I kinda like the way you feel
There's no stopping with the love these
Would you singing on form of thrill
One more taste is gonna put us in a garbage bin

Da-di-da, da-di-da, da-di-da
We've known the end was near, burying all our fears
Da-di-da, da-di-da, da-di-da
A beautiful misery, now we can rest in peace

I hear all the fuss and the fighting
So we take it to the room and ignite this
Can't let me, can't let me, kid up to killing me
Killing me, killing me, this does the end of me

But is a warfare
So need no really night just to got there
Can't let me, can't let me, kid up to killing me
Killing me, killing me, this does the end of me

Looking up in cold sweats
Finding back the memories, when friends don't turn into enemies
That wish you walking dead
Trading in cavity full of insanity

I hear all the fuss and the fighting
So we take it to the room and ignite this
Can't let me, can't let me, kid up to killing me
Killing me, killing me, this does the end of me

But is a warfare
So need no really night just to got there
Can't let me, can't let me, kid up to killing me
Killing me, killing me, this does the end of me

I hear all the fuss and the fighting
So we take it to the room and ignite this
Can't let me, can't let me, kid up to killing me
Killing me, killing me, this does the end of me

But is a warfare
So need no really night just to got there
Can't let me, can't let me, kid up to killing me
Killing me, killing me, this does the end of me

Can't let me, can't let me, kid up to killing me
Killing me, killing me, this does the end of me
