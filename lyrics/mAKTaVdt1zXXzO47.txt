Life was messing with my brain
Going circles day by day
Sometimes I feel
I'm loosing up my mind
Stress is pulling up the strain
Forgotten places, airplanes
But you don't know what I keep inside
I've got electric beat
Running through my veins
Your city, every street
Is ready for romance
This song is on repeat
Will start a massive fire
Can't you feel the vibe?

I'm all for the love
I'm all for the love
There's no way
To keep it all inside
I'm all for the love
I'm all for the love
And felling it is
Not committing crime

Days will never be the same
Addicted to this crazy game
But it don't matter when I see you smile
Never doing it for fame
And I will never feel the shame
Sending shivers down your spines
I've got electric beat
Running through my veins
Your city, every street
Is ready for romance
This song is on repeat
Will start a massive fire
Can't you feel the vibe?

I'm all for the love
I'm all for the love
There's no way to keep it all inside
I'm all for the love
I'm all for the love
And felling it is
Not committing crime

I'm all for the love
I'm all for the love
There's no way to keep it all inside
I'm all for the love
I'm all for the love
And felling it is
Not committing crime

I'm all for the love (I'm all for the love)
I'm all for the love
There's no way to keep it all inside
I'm all for the love (I'm all for the love)
I'm all for the love
And felling it is
Not committing crime
