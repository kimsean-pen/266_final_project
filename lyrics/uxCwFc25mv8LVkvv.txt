You know,
It's in the way you move,
The way you look at me,
The clarity I see
In how much hate you have.
The fierceness in your hands,
The twitching seething rage,
All hidden under flesh,
All waiting for a crack,
A tiny suggestion
That this is how to play
In silence shoving down,
But everyone can see.
Now you're desperate for a cure
For the chaos you've become,
You know more than anyone
That I don't know the way,
Tiny space drilled in my chest
To wrestle weary hard,
But nothing's left inside this hole,
No plan to find a missing part,
You tore chunks out of it
And once just gave yourself away
And now you can't embrace the cold,
Can't sleep at night,
Can't dream,
Can't wonder it,
Can't find the thing you truly crave,
Instead giving it away
For something that you know.
It's in the way you speak,
The way you tongue your words,
The way you hide inside,
A growth you call your flesh,
Secure from all of us,
A garden in your head
To grow a heart of pain,
This is all that remains.
It's how you get by,
It's how you find your strenght
In empty solitude,
In quiet patient depths.
[You weren't conceived in love but in hate,
I couldn't wait to give you up,
You're an abomination.
(You're an abomination.)
You should never have been born.
(You should never have been born.)
Lies are like scars on your soul,
They destroy you.
We need something people can see,
Visual... stimulation,
Believe me, there is nothing more stimulating than crazy people.
If you look in the face of evil,
Evil's going to look right back at you.]
