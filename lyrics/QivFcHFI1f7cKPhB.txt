We don't communicate
Can you not say what's on your mind?
I see it everyday
You hide the truth behind your eyes

Honestly
There's no need
For you to hide
Talk to me
Can't you see?
I'm on your side

Honest
Honest
Say what it is you're trying to say
But if you lie to me again
I'll be the one that walks away
Is it in you to be honest?
Honest
Is it in you to be honest?

I still remember the day we met
I was hanging on your every word
I didn't think I would ever let
Somebody see into my world

Honestly
Can't you see?
I'm on your side

Say what it is you're trying to say
But if you lie to me again
I'll be the one that's walking away
Is it in you to be honest?
Honest
Is it in you to be honest?

Is it all in my head
Or was it something I said?
Because I'm trying to forgive
And now I'm trying to forget
You're telling me all of this
And when I'm hearing it in
It was all just a lie
Was it all just a lie?
Now I'm walking away
'Cause everything that you say
All that you ever tell to me is lies
Lies

Honest
Honest
Is it in you to be honest?

Say what it is you're trying to say
But if you lie to me again
I'll be the one that walks away
Is it in you to be honest?
Honest
Is it in you to be honest?
Is it in you to be honest?
