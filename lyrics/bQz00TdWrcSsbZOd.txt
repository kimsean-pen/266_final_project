Condemnation
Tried
Here on the stand with the book in my hand
Truth on my side
Accusations
Lies
Hand me my sentence, I'll show no repentance
I'll suffer with pride

If for honesty, you want apologies
I don't sympathize
If for kindness, you substitute blindness
Please open your eyes

Condemnation
Why?
Because my duty was always to beauty
And that was my crime
Feel elation
High
To know I can trust this fix of injustice
Time after time

If you see purity as immaturity
Well, it's no surprise
If for kindness, you substitute blindness
Please open your eyes
