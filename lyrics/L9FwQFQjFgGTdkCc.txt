We strike first
and we're unrehearsed
here we go again
to stage the greatest show on heaven and earth
come on, get your money's worth

don't wanna live
(can't live)
don't wanna give
(can't give)
don't wanna be
(won't be)
E-M-P-I-R-E
(can't live)
don't wanna live
(can't give)
don't wanna be
(won't be)
E-M-P-I-R-E

We're comin on fast
and we're built to last
we struggled once in 'Nam
now we're glad to finally say
those days have passed
tell me how long can it last!

don't wanna live
(can't live)
don't wanna give
(can't give)
don't wanna be
(won't be)
E-M-P-I-R-E
(can't live)
don't wanna live
(can't give)
don't wanna be
(won't be)
E-M-P-I-R-E

We just started out
you don't need to be afraid
yeah you deserve to be attained

and our breathing hearts burst
but even ten million souls
marching in February couldn't stop the worst,
couldn't reverse

don't wanna live
(can't live)
don't wanna give
(can't give)
don't wanna be
(won't be)
E-M-P-I-R-E
(can't live)
don't wanna live
(can't give)
don't wanna be
(won't be)
E-M-P-I-R-E

i can't live
if it isn't with you

We just started out
You don't need to be afraid.
Yeah you deserve two minutes hate.
Well, we spit and we cursed and our bleeding hearts burst
But even ten million souls marching in February couldn't stop the worst
C-c-c-couldn't reverse.
