Fire! fly hard into the night
Strapped to a rocket ignited
Fire! Last meal sits in your body
Gasoline turpentine gunpowder glycerine
Fire! Last rights given to you

Genuflecting with a torch

Fire! Punishment outweights the crime
Explode into the desert sky!
...
Say your goodbyes

That was your life
You'll pay all your penance
Laser cannon deth sentance

D-d-d-d-d-die!
D-d-d-d-d-die!

D-d-d-d-d-die!
D-d-d-d-d-die!

Die!
...
I'm a rocket
A roman candle
A fucking missile
On my way to hell
I'm a martyr

A saint of sinners
And you will fear me in my deth

There's no one that can make me
Repent the things i've done
Evil is my prime objective

I explode and bestow your deth
I'm a rocket
A fucking weapon
Of mass destruction

Destroy the planet
My lawyer fucked me
I won't get pardoned
The devil waits with fear in his eyes
...
Seeth blood blazing the sky
...
Fire! Strapped to the mode of destruction
Cell-mates explode in front
Barbequed bone fragments bloodied face
blistered skin
Last moments near you now
As the countdown proceeds
Punishment is your reward
Laugh as they collect your life
(Solo)
Say, your goodbyes
That was your life
You'll pay, all your penance
Laser cannon deth sentance
Say, your goodbyes
That was your life
You'll pay, all your penance
Laser cannon deth sentance
