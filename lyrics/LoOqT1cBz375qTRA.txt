I sang
A song with no words
It sounded absurd
But it brought my numbers up
"Fair game"
Or whatever works
For better or worse
Who are you to be the judge?

Too late
What's done is done
It's only begun
No better time to hide your face
Clean break
I pray for the sun
C'mon c'mon
You know it's so

Hard to do the right thing
I can't do the right thing now
So hard to do the right thing
I can't do the right thing now

This takes
An army to play
There's no other way
How long can I face the blame
Save me
I knew all along
Now there's no one
I know it's so

Hard to do the right thing
I can't do the right thing now
So hard to do the right thing
I can't do the right thing now

Right thing now

It's so hard to do the right thing
I can't do the right thing now
So hard to do the right thing
I can't do the right thing now
