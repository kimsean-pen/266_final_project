Counting all the assholes in the room
Well I'm definitely not alone
Well I'm not alone
You're a liar, you're a cheater, you're a fool
Well that's just like me yoohoo
And I know you too

Mr. Perfect don't exist my little friend
And I tell you that again
And I do it again
Counting all the assholes in the room
Well I'm definitely not alone
Well I'm not alone

Look deep into yourself before you blame
All others for betrayal, now for betrayal
A promise so easy to say
And easy you fail
And you do it again

Well the music seems to comfort
And all the liquid do the colours
Well I turn my back and go for
All the better things in order

Well maybe you think your lie is safe
But I read you like a letter
Yeah like a letter
Your charm do not evens the pain
It fills me with rage
And you do it again

Well the music seems to comfort
And all the liquid do the colours
Well I turn my back and go for
All the better things in order

Well the music seems to comfort
And all the liquid do the colours
Well I turn my back and go for
All the better things in order

And a gangster keeps on telling
That he got a song that matters
So I flip a coin towards him
Thank you very much for listening
