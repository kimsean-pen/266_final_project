What once did exist, now is meaningless
And doesn't it seem funny, how soon you did forget?
All the words have now lost their weight
But I remember, I remember

Desperation, devastation
All I truly know
Is isolation, self damnation
All light that I'd own was shed and worthless now

What I knew was wrong, one who lived is gone
Guess it was just an echo when you would sing my song
All the notes you'd forgotten now
You left abandoned, I remember

Desperation, devastation
All I truly know
Is isolation, self damnation
All light that I'd own was shed and worthless now

I can hate myself more, more than anyone
Will you join me?

I know you know that this tortures me
Have I created the suffering, show me
Or do you happily cut, further in?
To sever what's left inside, that binds me

Now all I feel is desperation, devastation
All I truly know
Is isolation, self damnation
All light that I'd own was shed and worthless now

Desperation, devastation
All I truly know
Is isolation, self damnation
All light that I'd own was shed and worthless, worthless now
