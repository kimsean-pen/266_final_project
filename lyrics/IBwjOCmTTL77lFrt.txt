Friday night we'll be drinkin' Maneshevitz
Goin' out to terrorize goyim
Stompin' shagitz, screwin' shicksas
As long as we're home by Saturday mornin'

'Cause hey, we're the Brews
Sportin' anti-Swastika tattoos
Oi Oi we're the boys
The orthodox, hasidic, OG Ois

Orthopedic Dr. Martens good for
Waffle making, kickin' through the shin
Reputation, gained through intimidation
Pacifism no longer tradition

'Cause hey, we're the Brews
Sportin' anti-Swastika tattoos
Oi Oi, we're the brews
The fairfax ghetto boys skinhead Hebrews

We've got the might, psycho meshuganas
We can't lose a fight as we are the chosen ones
Chutzpah driven, we battle then we feast
We celebrate, we'll separate our milk plates from our meat

Oi Oi, we're the Brews
Sportin' anti-Swastika tattoos
Oi Oi, we're the boys
Orthodox, hasidic, OG Ois

C'mon you Schmucks
One more time for Hershel

We're the brews
Sportin' anti-Swastika tattoos
Oi Oi, we're the boys
Orthodox, hasidic, OG Ois
We're the Brews
Sportin' anti-Swastika tattoos
Oi Oi, we're the boys
Orthodox, hasidic, OG Ois
