It all hangs in the balance, it's all a blur
This broken neck holds the weight of the world
The devil's finally admitted every deed
Scarecrows and hotels, a savage thrill
They come to life as your guts start to spill
And as it cuts and bleeds, a statue forms in me
I stand here frozen. I stand here frozen

I wish I could forget it
It's so hard I'll never get it right
Cold hearts on a colder night
The stronger the ties, the sharper the knife
I wish I could forget it
It's so hard I'll never get it right
Cold hearts on a colder night
The stronger the ties, the sharper the knife

They said this place would be different, it's still the same
I'm sanded faceless you've taken my name
A beaten mind won't heal, it takes you where you've been
Thorn in my stomach, pain in my side
You're smashing protons as two worlds collide
With hands as cold as steel I feel you holding me
I stand here frozen. I stand here frozen

I wish I could forget it
It's so hard I'll never get it right
Cold hearts on a colder night
The stronger the ties, the sharper the knife
I wish I could forget it
It's so hard I'll never get it right
Cold hearts on a colder night
The stronger the ties, the sharper the knife

So I walked out of the valley
I let myself feel the sun on my bare back
And melt the dirt off my skin
I let the breeze of the wind cleanse me
I let the elements in

It was my only fucking option
And again I was whole
And again I thought I could feel something one day
But this planet doesn't have a sun
It only has a moon that's lifeless
And every light that shines is a dead reflection

I wish I could forget it
It's so hard I'll never get it right
Cold hearts on a colder night
The stronger the ties, the sharper the knife
I wish I could forget it
It's so hard I'll never get it right
Cold hearts on a colder night
The stronger the ties, the sharper the knife
The stronger the ties, the sharper the knife
