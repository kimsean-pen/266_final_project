Do you remember when we were younger
We were hometown back fence jumpers
Free as an endless summer, oh-whoa
Kings and queens and make believe
We didn't need no cash, didn't need no gasoline
So much faith we could walk on water, yeah

We were on top of the world
Shooting stars, lighting up the boulevard
Pair of small town boys and girls
Wide open roads and broken hearts

If I had one wish, yeah
If I had one wish, oh
If I had one wish
We'd be together
Young forever
Young forever, oh yeah

Do you remember believing in magic
Taking a chance just 'cause we had it
Kinda crazy when you look back at it, oh-whoa
Oh and that first time feeling
Of that first time falling
Oh I remember everything

We were on top of the world
Shooting stars, lighting up the boulevard
Pair of small town boys and girls
Wide open roads and broken hearts

If I had one wish, yeah
If I had one wish, oh
If I had one wish
We'd be together
Young forever
Young forever

We were on top of the world
Shooting stars, lighting up the boulevard
Pair of small town boys and girls
Wide open roads and broken hearts

If I had one wish, yeah
If I had one wish, oh
If I had one wish
We'd be together
Young forever

If I had one wish, yeah
If I had one wish, oh
If I had one wish
We'd be together
Young forever

We were on top of the world
We were on top of the world
Young forever
We were on top of the world
Young forever

Do you remember when we were younger
So much faith we could walk on water, oh-whoa
