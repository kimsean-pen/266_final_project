Before the money, there was love
But before the money, it was tough
Then came the money through a plug
It's a shame this ain't enough, yo

Sitting back plotting, jotting information on my nation
Really started from the bottom, boy, cotton
But they still planting plantations, we keep buying in
Closed-minded men, pride is higher than the prices on your pradas
Balenciagas, balance my soccer with the henny agua
Me and my niggas tryna eat, you pussies empanada
The flow like plenty lava
With just a penny I could multiply my worth
And make you work for me for twenty hours
I swear these niggas love to copy, thanks for listening
This kid ain't been the same since Biggie smacked me at my christening
Watch your tradition and please play it safe
Cause your position on the top is switching right in front your face
Rocking on this bass with rhymes, I'm bustin' out
He duckin' down, got some issues now, headed for your house
So put the pistols down, got that red dot on your nose
Who put the clown on lock, jaws like the blue knows
Froze, keep your mouth closed or you can see the solar
I got connections that guaranteed to see closed doors
You hear that underground sonar
The way I flows, this wisdom
The Pros been on a mission
Listen into the chamber, get hyperbolic
They raisin' max, I raise stakes to keep the brolic
My bitches is macrocosmic, pass the chronic
The mastered sonics is lightyears above your conscious
You're novice, but I got notes that strike nerves
I promise your minds ain't sharp like my swords
So cut the BS, and don't worry where my jeans is
And PS: Your bitch a genius, learnt from my penis
I got dreams filling arenas and breaking brackets
Tend this racket, while I'm cracking a Serena
God damn, God bless the heaven that sent you
But now I'm breezing out, baby, cause my rent's due

Shit is really real out here
I said shit is really real out here
Just trying to get a deal out here
I'm screaming cream
Who fucking with the rap supreme?
Joey Bad, the Big Preem came to collect the green
I got a dollar and a dream, know what I mean?
And I gotta get my mama off the scene
And I gotta get my mama off the scene
Cash ruined everything around me
Cash ruined everything around me
Cash ruined everything around me
They say money is the root of all evil
I see money as the route of all people
Cause we all follow paper trails, paper trails
And everybody gotta pay their bills, pay their bills
And everybody gotta pay their bills, pay their bills
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all

Before the money, there was love
But before the money, it was tough
Then came the money through a plug
It's a shame this ain't enough, yo
