So hard to say goodbye
Leaving you today
I've said goodbye before
Leaving you alone
By the sea

We were thrown together
A world unlike our own
Believing in eachother
We drifted far away
By the sea
By the sea

Some may say
Love comes easy
Unlike love
Ours was empty
Insincere and ever-fading
Your words of love left me lonely
Once I did love, is lost before it's found
A chance that my love will never become, never become

Someone else will love me
Though I may think of you
It doesn't really matter
'Cause all my love was lost
By the sea

In time, I may forgive you
Or tell myself a lie
And leave what never was
Another chance to be
By the sea
By the sea
By the sea
