I don"t know
What to think
I don"t know
How to feel

No joy
Nothing sad
Just vast emptiness

Here I lie on my bed
Smoking cigs
Having drinks

I don"t care what"s outside
What"s inside
I don"t know myself
I don"t know
What to yearn
I don"t know
How to hope

Dead mind
Palsied soul
Slowly crumbling away

Partly left
Partly gone
I am weak
I am tired

No more dreams
Only sleep
I am mute
I am deaf
