Sometimes I get these feelings
and I don't know what to say
Is it taht I don't belong here
Cause I really want to stay
Sometimes I wish that you
Could break up to me
Is this real

In time I found myself
Wishing that you were here
But then I realized
That all time stood still
Sometimes I wish that you
Could break down to me
Is this real
