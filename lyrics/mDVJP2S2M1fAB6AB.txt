You wanna stay
I want to run

I wanna start
You want to end

You are away
I'm hidden back

I lost my way
You want me back

You tore me apart
I pushed you too far

You are afraid to leave
I am afraid to leave you

You tore me apart
You are already gone
I am too blind to see it

Here we are, to the edge
Stop pretending, it's fake
We know it
Here we are, to the end
Stop pretending, it's vain
We know it

You try not to see
I dare you to feel
We wanna be free
We wanna know

You are afraid to leave
I am afraid to leave you

I pushed you too far

You are already gone
I am too blind to see it

You never talk about
I never listen
