All we know, now has come undone
Balance lost between the moon and sun
Hear our prayer, keeper of the sky divine
Upon us all, let your wisdom shine

Losing faith as the madness prevails
In us all we are searching for a reason
A need to calm the storm
In our sails let your winds be strong

Breathe the air around you
The oceans fill your veins and winds embrace your heart
Feel the change within you
The sun and moon align
The grand design awaits a new start

From the skies, looking down on you
Through the clouds tainted crystal blue
Such advancement, yet lacking the control
Unaware of your earthly role

Praise this child and the words of her rhyme
A sacred gift, magic of the five will bring you tranquillity
A new order of equality

Five senses come alive
Five reasons thrive
Five nations unite
Unite as one

Night and day will find a way
To keep the balance true
Let the sky and stars be your guide
The destination is up to you

Raise our heads up to the skies
Feel the essence of time
Changing ways like the shifting tides
In the waves hear the rhyme
