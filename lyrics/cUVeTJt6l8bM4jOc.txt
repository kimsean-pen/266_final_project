When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only
Light we see
No, I won't be afraid
No, no, no, no, I won't be afraid

Just as long, just as long, as you
Stand by me

And darling, darling
Whenever I'm in trouble
Stand
I need you
I
Oh, stand by me

Oh stand by me
If the sky that we look upon

Should tumble and fall
And the mountains they crumble
May crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long, as you stand
Stand by me
So darling darlin
I need you
I need your helping hand
I need someone to come pick me up
And stand by me
Oh stand by me
Oh stand, stand by me
So darling, darling
Stand by me
Oh stand by me
Oh stand, stand by me, stand by me
Wherever you are in trouble wont you
Stand by me
Oh stand by me
Oh stand, stand by me
Stand by me
