Dust devil swept you away
It's still not real
I should learn in silence
Talk to me

Dust devil swept you away
My recollections are all that's left of you
Swirl and sway
Without me

Dust devil swept you away
Whirling, playful dancing
About you

What's left of you
I should learn in this
Silent horizon

Dust devil swept you away
It's still not real
I should learn in silence

Dust devil swept you away
My recollections are all that's left of you
Swirl and sway without me

Dust devil swept you away
Whirling playful dancing
What's left of you
I should learn in this silent
Horizon

Swirl and sway without me
Dust devil swept you away
Whirling playful dancing
About you

What's left of you
I should learn in this
Silent
