The days are cold, living without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinking about you
You may be gone, but you're never over

If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now

You try, it'll be them doors on Dre's Phantom, believe me clowns
That means "suicide" homie, you'll never throw me
Off of this course, blow me! Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I'm not just talking awards, homie
And the ball's in my court and it's lonely on top of the world
When you're the only one with the balls in your shorts

To leave their jaws on the floors with no re-morse
Remember that when they get to dogging you boy, homie
So y'all can just get to blogging about bologna, I'm not gonna stop
The saga continue, no stopping the force Obi, I'm mopping the floors
With them, I keep trying pass it, but they keep on dropping the torch

And it won't be long till this sport is O-V-E-R
Just Blaze and me we are knocking on doors and no we
Ain't pumpkins on Halloween but we'll show up on your porch, so be
Careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here so follow me
Through the fog like I'm S-N-double-O-P

Let me guide you through the smoke G
If only I wasn't traveling down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me

The days are cold, living without you

The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinking about you
You may be gone, but you're never over

And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh

And I miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
Homie I'll never forget you, no

For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it'll blow up the mic, It'll put the "dyna" in mite

Yeah it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancing all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself
Yeah it's the best thing I could do right now Doody for you is to rep'

So I'm gonna fuck till I die, yeah I'mma do it to death
And instead of mourning your death, I'd rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new height, step on the gas and accelerate, I'mma need 2 mics
Cause the way that I'm feeling tonight, everything I can just do right
There's nothing that I can do wrong, I'm too strong and I'm just too hyped

Just finished the rhyme and I bust it, and - excuse the corny metaphor
They'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered
So God just help me out while I fight through this grieving process
Tryna process this loss is making me nauseous
But this depression ain't taking me hostage
I've been patiently watching this game, pacing these hallways
You had faith in me always

Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes
Come right back on they asses, and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And I'mma show them, blow them out the water slaughter them homes
I'mma own so many belts, the only place they can hit me is below them

Homie I know I'm never gonna be the same without you
I never would've came in this game, I'm going insane without you
Matter of fact it was just the other night, had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up I spread my wings and I flew

You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me "Naw, Doody you're not!" Laying on that table, I knew
I was gonna make it, soon as you said "Think of Hailie", I knew
There wasn't no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies, and Proof

Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need, for one more day to get through
So homie this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you Doody
The days are cold, living without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinking about you
You may be gone, but you're never over
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And it don't stop, oh
And it don't quit, oh
And I miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
I just miss you, oh
Homie I'll never forget you, no
