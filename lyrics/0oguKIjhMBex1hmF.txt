Nothing is a color
I cross the desert
Nothing is alive

What does the black top know that I have not cracked with my mind
Nothing is a color
Gray as the pill
Nobody Cries
Why do the screek lamp shine on still
Nothing is alive

I feel love every million miles
I feel love
Every once in a while

I feel love every million miles
I feel love
Every once in a while

Nothing is a color
I cross the desert
Nothing is alive

What does the black top know that I have not cracked with my mind
Nothing is a color
Gray as the pill
Deep in the eye
Why do the screek lamp shine on still
When nothing is alive

I feel love every million miles
I feel love
Every once in a while

I feel love every million miles
I feel love
Every once in a while

Why does my heartbeat feel like a speaker?
Feeding back
Repeater
Repeater

Why does my heartbeat feel like a speaker?
Feeding back
Repeater
Repeater

Why does my heartbeat feel like a speaker?
Feeding back
Repeater
Repeater
Why does my heartbeat feel like a speaker?
Feeding back
I feel love every million miles
I feel love
Every once in a while
I feel love every million miles
I feel love
Every once in a while
