Tryin to analyze every angle, situation
Tryin to find an explanation
Cause it's gettin aggrivatin
Why my relationships never seem to work out
Beginnin' to worry and doubt
If I'm even able to detect he's the one
When this day you're wonderin
Why I havent seen the sun
Shine his light on my heart and help me ease the pain
Cause I'm gettin tired of the rain

Fallin on my heartbreak and I
Get my hopes up when I'm in love
Until we break up then I'm back to the
Same spot, I've been lonely, drownin
Cause every guy turns out to be the same
So now I'm questionin' is it me to blame

CHORUS:
Is It Me? am I so complicated?
Is It Me? or is love over-rated?
Is It Me? cause I dont quite understand
Why it never turns out how I thought I planned it
Is It Me? am I too independent?
Is It Me? not ready for commitment?
Is It Me? cause it doesnt seem to last
And it's the only question that I never asked

Maybe I'm longin' for it more than I should be expecting
All the standards that I'm settin
Unrealistically I'm gettin
Possibly in the way of what is left to have in store
Because I'm so confused and insecure
Cause when i know for certain everything is goin wrong
I permitted to prolong
Tried my best to hold on
My Mister Right's probably hangin round my window pane
While I look through only watchin the rain

Fallin on my heartbreak and I
Get my hopes up when I'm in love
Until we break up then I'm back to the
Same spot, I've been lonely, drownin
Cause every guy turns out to be the same
So now I'm questionin' is it me to blame

-CHORUS-

Never thought it could be that its me
Till i realized I'm the only
Common factor and played a big part
In lettin people break my heart
Never noticin' i was wasting time
Askin the same thing every time
Who were you with? and where were you at?
Until I took the time to turn and look back

ooooh la la la
la la la la
la la la

-CHORUS x2-

la la la
la la la la la
la la la
