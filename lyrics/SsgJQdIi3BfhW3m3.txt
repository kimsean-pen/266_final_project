Hey, girl, I'm waiting on you, I'm waiting on you
Come on and let me sneak you out
And have a celebration, a celebration
The music up, the window's down

Yeah, we'll be doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool and we know it too
Yeah, we'll keep doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool, so tonight

Let's go crazy, crazy, crazy till we see the sun
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some! And live while we're young
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
And live while we're young
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Tonight let's get some! And live while we're young

Hey girl, it's now or never, it's now or never
Don't over-think, just let it go
And if we get together, yeah, get together
Don't let the pictures leave your phone, ohh

Yeah, we'll be doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool, so tonight

Let's go crazy, crazy, crazy till we see the sun
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some! And live while we're young
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Wanna live while we're young
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Tonight let's get some! And live while we're young

And, girl, you and I
We're 'bout to make some memories, tonight
I wanna live while we're young
We want to live while we're young

Let's go crazy, crazy, crazy 'till we see the sun
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some and live while we're young

Crazy, crazy, crazy 'till we see the sun
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some and live while we're young

Wanna live, wanna live
Wanna live while we're young
Wanna live, wanna live
Wanna live while we're young
Wanna live, wanna live
Wanna live while we're young
Tonight let's get some and live while we're young
