O Don't ya know
Don't wanna see ya any more
Put up or shut up
Ya spell, ya read,
D.O.O.R.

Ya got a big mouth and I'm happy to see
Your foot is firmly entrenched where a molar should be

If you talk much louder you could get an award
From the Federal Communication Board

Don't be cruel
Be a thing - sweet thing
As a rule

Don't be sad
I left you in the street
You're pre-tab
I had to get away

Chorus:

Don't go away sad
Don't go pre-tab
Don't go be bad
Don't go away mad, just go away

O Don't ya know
Don't wanna see ya here no more
Pack it and move it
Ya spell, ya read, O.U.T. out

Don't be bad
A mad hatter's beret
Sometimes you look like you just made an escape

Don't be mad
Or lose your medicaid cool
Of course cool rhymes with fool

Don't go be bad
Cause you been had
Don't go away sad
Don't go away mad, just go away

O Don't ya know
Don't wanna see ya curse and pout
Pack it and move it
Ya spell, ya read, O.U.T. out

You got a big mouth and I'm happy to see
Your foot is firmly entrenched where a molar should be

Don't be mad or lose your medicaid cool
Of course cool rhymes with fool
