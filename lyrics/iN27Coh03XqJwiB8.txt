Beauty lies inside the eye
Of another youthful dream
That doesn't sell its soul for self-esteem
That's not plasticine

Beauty lies inside desire
And every wayward heart redeemed
That doesn't sell its soul for self-esteem
That's not plasticine

Don't forget to be the way you are
Don't forget to be the way you are
Don't forget to be the way you are
Don't forget to be the way you are

The only thing you can rely on
Is that you can't rely on anything
Don't go and sell your soul for self-esteem
Don't be plasticine

Don't forget to be the way you are
Don't forget to be the way you are
Don't forget to be the way you are
Don't forget to be the way you are

Don't forget to be the way you are
Don't forget to be the way you are
Don't forget to be the way you are
Don't forget to be the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
The way you are
The way you are
