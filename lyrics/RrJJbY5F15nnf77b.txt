Just another bruise earned
One more lesson learned
Just another kick from behind
Just another punch in the eye
Another broken tooth
Against the bitter truth
Over and over again
I say: "No pain, no gain"

I've never thought this nostalgia
This ache could be everlasting
Who's in front of me?
I'll cut you deep
Like once you did for the first and the last time

Past in a trash bag
No need to take it back
Keep my heart spare
Reanimated from despair
Another bee-sting
Another fall from a swing
Over and over again
I've got myself obtained

I've never thought this nostalgia
This ache could be everlasting
Who's in front of me?
I'll cut you deep
Like once you did for the first and the last time
This nostalgia
This ache could be everlasting
Who's in front of me?
I'll cut you deep
Like once you did for the first and the last time

No! No pain again
No! No pain again

I'll cut you deep with forgiveness
My pain transformed into your sickness

I've never thought this nostalgia
This ache could be everlasting
Who's in front of me?
I'll cut you deep
Like once you did for the first and the last time
This nostalgia
This ache could be everlasting, everlasting
Who's in front of me?
I'll cut you deep
Like once you did for the first and the last time
