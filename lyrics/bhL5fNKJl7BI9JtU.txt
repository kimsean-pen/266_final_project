I got a new disease
I saw it on TV
It's takin hold of me
And I believe that I might be insane
My thoughts are incomplete
Of late I don't get sleep
They say it's clear to see
That ADD is all that's left to blame

I can't get it together
I should know better
I got a mind like weather
That always seems to change
It's getting harder
So I need a doctor
He's gonna make me smarter
At least that's what they say

I've been bouncing off the walls
And shaking, the Adderall
Won't loosen the pressure
There's only so much I can take

Wake up, I need someone
To stop me, cause Adderall
Won't loosen the pressure
There's only so much I can take
There's only so much I can take

I break into the scene
Buzz from a new vaccine
That's curing all my dreams
It's fine with me, as long as I get more

My doors left off the latch
And all my mirrors cracked
Now there's no turning back
So I just laugh and pass out on the floor

I can't get it together
I should know better
I got a mind like weather
That always seems to change
It's getting harder
So I need a doctor
He's gonna make me smarter
At least that's what they say

I've been bouncing off the walls
And shaking, the Adderall
Won't loosen the pressure
There's only so much I can take

Wake up, I need someone
To stop me, cause Adderall
Won't loosen the pressure
There's only so much I can take

There's only so much I can take

I can't sleep cause I don't wanna
And I don't want no marijuana
Tell my mom I tried to warn ya
Take one more and I'm a goner

I've been bouncing off the walls
And shaking, the Adderall
Won't loosen the pressure
There's only so much I can take

I've been bouncing off the walls
And shaking, the Adderall
Won't loosen the pressure
There's only so much I can take

Wake up, I need someone
To stop me, cause Adderall
Won't loosen the pressure
There's only so much I can take
There's only so much I can take
There's only so much I can take
