You don't see me
Now I am far away
You don't feel me
Now I am not like yesterday
Time goes back
Leaving a trail of nowhere
We rush forward
Like stars falling from nowhere

Now you see
I'm with you was just for you
Now you hear
So I'm still here
It is true
Let's take a look
Deeply in each others eyes
Where we are
Bounded from the very start

Because cause cause cause
We went from the side
Where was born The Sun

Because cause cause cause
We went from the side
Where was born The Sun

Because cause cause cause
We went from the side
Where was born The Sun

Because cause cause cause
We went from the side
Where was born The Sun

You didn't let me say I know
That all of this is just for you
You turned away from me I know
And forgot it was you to call me though

I don't want to ask the why
Because I know the answer
Don't cry
I don't want to ask you how
What has been done is done
So

Because cause cause cause
We went from the side
Where was born The Sun

Because cause cause cause
We went from the side
Where was born The Sun

Because cause cause cause
We went from the side
Where was born The Sun

Because cause cause cause
We went from the side
Where was born The Sun

A harsh wind is taking my thoughts far away
I feel as fall leaf
Torn off from the hanging tree
No more I will get back
To you that past way
Thats you who'll reach me
Taking off from land free

No more I will get back
Me taking off from land free
No more I will get back
Me taking off from land free
No more I will get back
No more I will get back
No more I will get back
No more I will get back
No more I will get back
No more I will get back

From the side
Where was born The Sun
Where was born The Sun

From the side
Where was born The Sun
Where was born The Sun
