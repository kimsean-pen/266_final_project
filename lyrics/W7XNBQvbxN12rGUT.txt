And I'm clean now
Mimicking hawks
I've climbed to the top of a poisonous valley
Valleys, pastel sheets draped across my feet
Violet flowers weep beneath my feet
Call the subordinate valley, to repeat
Like an infant's cry
Rise & echo forward [rise & echo forward] to the water's edge
To meet the beating of the waves
& form some kind of truce
Love uneven
Water whispering, the
Absent pattern of your feet
Our love echoed the valley, crying low into the
Land, hiding its flowered head from the wind
