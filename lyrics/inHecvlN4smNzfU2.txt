She held from Cali by way, way, way far out in the stars
Familiar to the charm of a man like me from Mars
New York, New York, I fell in love more times that I can count
Miami, the city, gave me her first kiss right after I held her heart (they say women are from...)
The island girls, how they move, like dancing is a language
In Germany they smiled at me like that's all I demanded

So tell me how could you ever go wrong with the girls who call Earth home?
How can you ever hate life yeah, when the beauty's out there everywhere?

I would've nearly lost my mind when I stopped to think in time
How much love you brought to me
You are such a lovely lady
I wouldn't know a world without you, I wouldn't know just what to do
But with the light you beam, and all you feel, I know your heart is true (they say women are from...)
