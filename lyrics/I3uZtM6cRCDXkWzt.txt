Every morning in my sheets
Loving the way your body feels
Now that you're mine, mhm

It's a sign of my love
When you're dancing for the world, it gets too much
Never been about your trust
It's just a sign of my love, love, love, love
It's just a sign of my love, love, love, love

Growing old and speaking wise
Still, I hold you oh so tight
And I know that I'm too much sometimes

But it's a sign of my love
I get jealous from the guys that crave your touch
Yeah, it's running in my blood
It's a sign of my love
When you're dancing for the world, it gets too much
Never been about your trust
It's just a sign of my love, love, love, love
It's just a sign of my love, love, love, love
It's just a sign of my
