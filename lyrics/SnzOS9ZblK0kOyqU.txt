Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, ooh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, ooh

Seen many men in my time
But none of them compare to mine
I ain't gotta knock on wood
To tell y'all that I got it so good

He's everything that I need and
All that a man should be and
Put me on a flight if I wanna
Buy out the mall if I wanna

And I know you're hurting
For these same old metaphors
And my love is so much more
I don't wanna change it
I don't wanna do without ya baby

'Cause he's just above the rest
I must confess the best
Love that I've ever had
And I just gotta let you know this

Don't let 'em tell you nothing different
You're the only one I'm needing
I don't want no one but you
Baby no one will do

And what they say don't even matter
They don't know what I know about ya
I don't want no one but you
Baby no one will do

It's me and him through the wire
'Cause when it comes to love he delivers
My personal UPS
I'm sending him an SOS

That I love him and I want him
And don't wanna replace him with nobody else
I'ma keep holding on
I'ma keep the loving strong

And I know you're hurting
For these same old metaphors
My love is so much more
I don't wanna change it
I don't wanna do without ya baby

'Cause he's just above the rest
I must confess the best
Love that I've ever had
And I just gotta let you know this

Don't let 'em tell you nothing different
You're the only one I'm needing
I don't want no one but you
Baby no one will do

And what they say don't even matter
They don't know what I know about ya
I don't want no one but you
Baby no one will do

I don't want nobody, nobody
Nobody, no, no, no, nobody but you

I don't want nobody but you
You're the only one for me boo
But you know that you want me too
I don't want nobody but you

I don't want nobody but you
You're the only one for me boo
But you know that you want me too
I don't want nobody but you

Don't let 'em tell you nothing different
You're the only one I'm needing
I don't want no one but you
Baby no one will do

And what they say don't even matter
They don't know what I know about ya
I don't want no one but you
Baby no one will do

I don't want no one but you, you, you, you, you
No one else will do
No one else, no no no no no no

No one else will do
No one else will do
Nobody nobody nobody nobody
Nobody nobody nobody nobody, yeah yeah
