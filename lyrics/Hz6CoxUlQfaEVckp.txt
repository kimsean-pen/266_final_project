She's gone to sea
She's fighting for me
What bravery!

I'm sleeping in a battle ship
I'm sleeping in a submarine
I'm sleeping in a fighter plane
I'm sleeping going down the drain

Antiaircraft guns
Have more fun
In the sun

All hands on deck
The radio address
What a mess!

A cage is a cage
is a cage is a cage
