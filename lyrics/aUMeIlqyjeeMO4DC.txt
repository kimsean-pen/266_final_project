Struggling to stay awake
Don't wanna take my chances (Wake up)
Tossing and turning
How am I supposed to block these voices?
Drifting off to sleep
Count sheep, you're now in deep
Whimper though you wanna shout
No use, he's in, you're out

One, two, three, you're now in a dream
Never look back, never look
'Cause you're gonna crack
Five, six, seven, see the flood lights beam
Down on you as you wanna scream
Eight, nine, ten, here we go again
You can lie down
You can lie but you're gonna drown
End of the games, your number is up for now

Wake up! Who said that?
Am I awake? My eyes are shut
Weary once again
But was I out? What the hell was that all about?
Where did all these scars come from?
Still warm, blood on the sheets
But was all real? I just don't wanna feel

One, two, three, you're now in a dream
Never look back, never look
'Cause you're gonna crack
Five, six, seven, see the flood lights beam
Down on you as you wanna scream
Eight, nine, ten, here we go again
You can lie down, you can lie
But you're gonna drown
End of the games, your number is up for good
One, two, three, you're now in a dream
Never look back, never look
'Cause you're gonna crack
Five, six, seven, see the flood lights beam
Down on you as you wanna scream
