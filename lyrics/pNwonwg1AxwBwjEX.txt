A single rose left to remember
As a single tear falls from her eye
Another cold day in December
A year from the day she said goodbye

It seems its only been a moment
Since the angels took him from her arms
And she was left there
Holding on to their tomorrow
But as they lay him in the ground

Her heart would sing without a sound
For the first time you can open your eyes
And see the world without your sorrow

And no one knows the pain you left behind
And all the peace you could never find
Is waiting there to hold you, keep you
Welcome to the first day of your life

Just open up your eyes
Eyes
A single lifetime lays behind her
As she draws her final breath

Just beyond the door he'll find her
And taking her hand he softly says
For the first time you can open your eyes

And see the world without your sorrow
And no one knows the pain you left behind
And all the peace you could never find

Is waiting there to hold you, keep you
Welcome to the first day of your life

Just open up your eyes
As I lay down tonight
Safe on the other side

No more tears to cry
For the first time you can open your eyes
And see the world without your sorrow
And no one knows the pain you left behind
And all the peace you could never find
Is waiting there to hold you, keep you
Welcome to the first day of your life
Just open up your eyes
Eyes
Eyes
Eyes
