So long ago
I didn't have a care about me
I didn't know my right from wrong
But now I know
That you got your love around me
You know it makes me feel so strong

Baby if you turn around
And prove to me it's real
Maybe we can work it out
'Cause this is how I feel

Do you know when you go when you give it all away
I'll be there for you, care for you
Love you everyday, oh baby
And do you feel the same for me?
Any day your away
And I feel a little low
I would cry for you, die for you
Just to let you know, oh baby
And if you come to me, you know I'll make it right

Through out my life
I'd never thought I'd have somebody
Someone to call my own
And now I've found
A little bit of heaven baby
A place to call my home

Baby if you turn around
And prove to me it's real
Maybe we can work it out
'Cause this is how I feel

Do you know when you go when you give it all away
I'll be there for you, care for you
Love you everyday, oh baby
And do you feel the same for me?
Any day your away
And I feel a little low
I would cry for you, die for you
Just to let you know, oh baby
And if you come to me, you know I'll make it right

Baby, don't you know you gotta
Slow down, before you know you gonna
Break down and turn around
Before you know, you go and break my heart
When will you learn to be
A little helpful when you think of me
A little careful when you're close to me
'Cause baby, I loved you from the start

Baby if you turn around
And prove to me it's real
Maybe we can work it out
'Cause this is how I feel (This is how I feel... This is how I feel)
I love you baby

Do you know when you go when you give it all away
I'll be there for you, care for you
Love you everyday, oh baby
Do you feel the same for me?
Any day your away
And I feel a little low
I would cry for you, die for you
Just to let you know, oh baby
I would die
I love you baby

Do you know when you go when you give it all away
I'll be there for you, care for you
Love you everyday, oh baby
Do you feel the same for me?
Any day your away
And I feel a little low
I would cry for you, die for you
Just to let you know, oh baby
I would die

And if you come to me, you know I'll make it right
