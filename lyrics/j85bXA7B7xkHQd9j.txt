The willow weeps
And having wept
Can weep no more
But still it cries for me
It cries in sympathy
It knows that you are gone
Don't leave me, baby

There was a time
When you were mine
And not so long ago
I used to say
You'd never go away
You'd never leave me lonely
Don't leave me, baby

Think about the happy times
The groovy times
Don't tell me they are gone
I just can't carry on
And know that you're not here
You're not near anymore
Whoa, whoa

Don't leave me, baby
Things are gonna work out fine
Don't leave me, baby
Think I'm goin' outta my mind
Don't leave me, baby
Don't leave me behind

Beep-beep, beep-beep, yeah
Beep-beep, beep-beep, yeah
Beep-beep, beep-beep, yeah
Beep-beep, beep-beep, yeah
Yeah-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-ah-ah

The willow weeps
And having wept
Can weep no more
But still it cries for me
It cries in sympathy
It knows that you are gone

Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-oh
Bop-bop-bop-bop, bop-ba-da, ba-da, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
