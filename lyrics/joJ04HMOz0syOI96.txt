Well the dream' in the ditch
Now the kids are all his
But it's not new to hate what they make you do
First they pull all your teeth
Then they'll watch you to eat
Well get over it kid
You don't want any part in it

But it's not the way you can afford your time
All the any other friends you left you
So in every... in heaven if anything you
Is it real? This is it

So they paid you to scream
But it many dreams
So you wait for the pain
Never seen you sleep again
Now you walk with your wounds
Like you've got nothing to lose
And like you don't care
While you wait for a cross the bear

But it's not the way you can afford your time
All the any other friends you left you
So in every... in heaven if anything you
Is it real? This is it

It this it? Is this it?
This is it
But it's not the way you can afford your time
All the any other friends you left you
So in every... in heaven if anything you
Is it real? This is it
