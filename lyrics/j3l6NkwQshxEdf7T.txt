You're alright, you're still breathing
Even though you feel dead sometimes
You'll be fine, you're still eating
Even though it doesn't last sometimes

'Cause even if your eyes are black
Your bones are always gold
'Cause they've climbed up every mountain
That no story's every told
'Cause even if your bags are packed
You'll never leave your home
'Cause you're scared of all the monsters
That are waiting to unfold

Blank noise, is an awful sound
And it hurts my ears, I don't know how
My name's just a silhouette
Hiding under all the sound down

'Cause even if your eyes are black
Your bones are always gold
'Cause they've climbed up every mountain
That no story's every told
'Cause even if your bags are packed
You'll never leave your home
'Cause you're scared of all the monsters
That are waiting to unfold

Boy, I'm scared
Boy, I'm scared
Boy, I'm scared
Boy, I'm scared
