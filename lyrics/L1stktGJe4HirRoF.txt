I wished I was smarter, I wished I was stronger.
I wished I love Jesus, the way my wife does.
I wish it had been easier, instead of any longer.
I wished I could have stood where you would have been proud,
that won't happen now, that won't happen now.

Chorus:
There's a whole lot of singing that's never gonna be heard,
Disappearing everyday without so much as a word somehow.
Think I broke the wings off that little song bird,
She's never gonna fly to the top of the world right now.
Top of the world.

I don't have to answer any of these questions.
Don't have no God to teach me no lessons.
I come home in the evening, sit in my chair.
One night they called me for supper, but I never got up,
I stayed right there in my chair.

Chorus:
There's a whole lot of singing that never gonna be heard,
Disappearing everyday without so much as a word somehow.
Think I broke the wings off that little song bird,
She's never gonna fly to the top of the world right now.
Top of the world.

I wished I'd a known you, wished I'd a shown you,
All of the things I was on the inside.
I'd pretend to be sleeping, when you come in in the morning
To whisper good-bye, go to work in the rain.
I don't know why, don't know why.

Cause everyone's singing, we just wanna be heard.
Disappearing every day without so much as a word somehow.
Wanna grab a hold of that little song bird,
Take her for a ride to the top of the world right now.
Whoa. Whoa. To the top of the world. To the top of the world.
To the top of the world. To the top of the world. To the top of the world.
To the top of the world. To the top of the world. To the top of the world.
