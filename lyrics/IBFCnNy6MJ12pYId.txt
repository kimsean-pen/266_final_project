Cut through
You put me on the floor with the 1, 2
And I just keep on spinning at the thought of you
At the thought of you, oh
Number One
With a bullet like you're coming from a
Shotgun
You're lying when you tell me I'm the only one
Tell me I'm the only one, oh

You got me now, down and out, it's a battle
Bury me down underground
Your love's become my enemy
You're gonna be the death of me
Wind me up, fill your cup like a river
Drunk on watching me drown
Your love's become my enemy
You're gonna be the death of me

Breakdown
We're dancing to the music that don't
Make a sound
We keep mixing like the mud and a wedding gown
The mud and a wedding gown, oh
Nothing new
I fall apart at the very thought of
Me and you
We're running through each other 'til we're black and blue
'Til we're black and blue, oh

You got me now, down and out, it's a battle
Bury me down underground
Your love's become my enemy
You're gonna be the death of me
Wind me up, fill your cup like a river
Drunk on watching me drown
Your love's become my enemy
You're gonna be the death of me

Number One
With a bullet like you're coming from a
Shotgun
You're lying when you tell me I'm the only one
So tell me I'm the only one, oh

You got me now, down and out, it's a battle
Bury me down underground
Your love's become my enemy
You're gonna be the death of me
Wind me up, fill your cup like a river
Drunk on watching me drown
Your love's become my enemy
You're gonna be the death of me

You're gonna be the death of me
