Your heart, your home, your voice, it's got a price tag
Sign in blood, bury your rights in a body bag
They're feeding fear through the fault lines
You heard it here first, they got your freedoms on the front line
Primetime, the noose at our throats
Our liberties hands run with blood of the scapegoats
So tell me how can we demonize
When we can't see life through another's eyes

Pay 'em off and play 'em off
Fear rolls like a reaper through the streets of the lost
Pay 'em off and play 'em off
But in the eyes of the storm

The truth drops like a bomb
The truth drops like a bomb
The battle is on

Hands in chains for a fist full of dollars
Who do we blame for the holes in our knowledge?
The past you know has been written by the victor
So I ask you now, who is it writing your future?
The butcher, the liar, the thief or the killer?
Your freedom died quiet in the halls of power
Starved for peace, we'll eat war until it kills us
Six feet deep with a belly full of bullets

Pay 'em off and play 'em off
Fear rolls like a reaper through the streets of the lost
Pay 'em off and play 'em off
But in the eyes of the storm

The truth drops like a bomb
The truth drops like a bomb
The battle is on

The hate runs deep, but our hopes cut deeper
Now we walk through the valley in the shadow of the reaper
Money talks, and it's speaking in tongues
They put a price on our soul like they had already won
Now open wide, I see their jaws locked tight
Silent in the moment like prey in the floodlights
The signal is static, baptised in fire
Now we see how they talk with a mouth full of barbed wire

Absolute power, absolute power, absolute power
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
Absolute power, absolute power, absolute power
Absolute power corrupts

The truth drops like a bomb
The truth drops like a bomb
The battle is on
The truth drops like a...

Absolute power corrupts absolutely
