I won't give up
Fightin' for your love
Oh lord
Alright

You try to push away
But baby uh you just wait
I'll break those chains

Fightin' for your love
I'll never stop
I'll never give up
Oh baby uh you will see
You are the one for me

You are the one for me

Yeahhh

Though many men have tried
For your love they have died
That's not the case with me
You'll see

I'll cross a thousand seas
And fight a swarm of bees
I'm gonna make love to you tonight

Fightin' for your love
I'll never stop
I'll never give up
I know that time is right
We'll be makin' love tonight

I can hear the lock howl
We're gonna make love
No harm, no foul
Lock howl
Oh baby uh baby uh please
No harm, no foul

I can hear the lock howl
We're gonna make love
No harm, no foul
Lock howl
Oh baby uh baby uh please
No harm, no foul

Ohh Yeahh
