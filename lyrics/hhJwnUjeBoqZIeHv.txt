Where have you gone?
Must've left for the town
Darlin', when you part
You won't slow down

Didn't you lay beside me
In my mother's home?
Hung like a pendant
My little heart of stone

Ooh!
Let me wear you like a beautiful dress
Let me love you
Let me wear you like a beautiful dress, yes!

Eyes open
Little milk on the tongue
Barely smiling
To see your service done

When you're near me
No love, more goodbyes
The hard thing about love
Is that it has to burn all the time

Come back!
Let me wear you like a beautiful dress
Let me love you
Let me wear you like a beautiful dress, yeah!

Come back!
Let me wear you like a beautiful dress
Let me love you
Let me wear you like a beautiful dress, yeah!
