Maybe
Dreams apart
You're visual for all
Maybe
Another time
You're more than air
In another state of mind
You're still dancing
In another state of mind

No need
To be afraid
You're not visual for all
You're no more than air
In another state of mind
You're still dancing
In another state of mind
(You're there)
