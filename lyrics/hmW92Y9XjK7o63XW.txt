Baby, don't say no so quick
This ain't about me trying to see how far I can get
Ain't gonna lie
Wouldn't mind a little eye to eye, lips on lips
Swayin' to the music, real close
We could both use a little let go
Kind of night, Baby if you want a good time

We could get on it
Let's Take a shot or you can sip on it
We'll find a floor that we can dance on it, Slow song it,
as far as I can tell, that finger ain't got no ring on it
So come on baby, bring on it
It's one of those stars fallin', love callin'
Get you feelin' alright nights,
Sounds good don't it, don't it
Every little thing, you've got to know
That I want it, want it
Sounds pretty good don't it.

Well, I've just now seen that smile
I bet it's a minute
Since you've tapped into your wild and crazy side
So baby, lets do this tonight
Baby, that moon looks just right, don't fight it

So baby let's get on it
Let's Take a shot or you can sip on it
We'll find a floor that we can dance on it
Slow song it,
As far as I can tell
That finger ain't got no ring on it
So come on baby, bring on it
It's one of those stars fallin', love callin'
Get you feelin' alright nights
Sounds good don't it, don't it
Every little thing
You've got to know that I want it, want it
Sounds pretty good don't it.

So baby lets get on it
You're gonna love it you can bet on it
Karaoke we can microphone it
Whatever you want,
As far as I can see
That finger ain't got no ring on it
So come on baby, bring on it
It's one of those stars fallin', love callin'
Get you feelin' alright nights,
Sounds good don't it, don't it,
Every little thing
You've got to know that I want it, want it
Sounds pretty good don't it.

Yeah, don't it
(hey hey hey)
Get you feelin' alright girl
Yeah, sounds pretty good, don't it
(hey hey hey)
Yeah sounds pretty good now don't it
