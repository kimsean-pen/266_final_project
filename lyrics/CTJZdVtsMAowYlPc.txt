I think it's about time that I warned you I might cry in front of you
and I don't want you to feel like I'm afraid of the truth
I didn't want you to feel like it was all your fault
but that doesn't mean that I wanted you to feel nothing at all

what do you want me to say when I can't tell you the truth
please tell me how the fuck I'm supposed to deal with losing you

so what's the point of talking if you're not changing your mind
it just reminds me of the lying and it's wasting my time
so was it worth it to me to wait around and then see
if all my love was well spent
my nighttime hikes and weekends
you are my best friend
I don't want this to end

what do you want me to say when I can't tell you the truth
please tell me how the fuck I'm supposed to deal with losing you

what do you want me to say when I can't tell you the truth
please tell me how the fuck I'm supposed to deal with losing you

it wasn't worth it to me to wait around and then see
all of my love gone spent
my nighttime hikes and weekends
you were my best friend
I didn't want it to end
