A Twisted Mind

You can't see them because you're blind
But I see them clear as crystal
Fooling and laughing at you
The demons are everywhere

Try not to deny the truth
And seek the dark reality as it is
Join me in this dark madness
And feel the power of the demons

Let the demons come!

You are sheep without a mind
Worshipping a god which don't exist
You are following the followers
Into emptiness

Persuaded and blinded by a weak religion
You shall face eternal pain
And you will meet no savior
To ease your suffering

Open your eyes
And deny religion
Open your mind
And face the demons
