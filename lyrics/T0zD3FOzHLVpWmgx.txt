Said you're gonna be here in a minute
Sitting in the mirror getting pretty
Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up
Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up
I can hear you knocking at the front door
And I know exactly what u came for
Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy
Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy
You touch me and it's breaking me down
I'm telling you let's just give it up and get down
So come on won't you give me something to remember?
Baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out
Even though we couldn't last forever, baby
You know what I want right now
Hit me one more time it's so amazing
How you shooked my world and flipped it upside down
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy
'cause you know me inside out
I know that we probably shouldn't do this

Wake up in the morning feeling stupid
Said that we were done but you're all up on me
Said that we were done but you're all up on me
Tell me how we got in this position

Guess I gotta get you out my system
Trying to let you go but it's not that easy
Trying to let you go but it's not that easy
You touch me and it's breaking me down

I'm telling you let's just give it up and get down
So come on won't you give me something to remember?
Baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out
Even though we couldn't last forever, baby

You know what I want right now
Hit me one more time it's so amazing
How you shooked my world and flipped it upside down
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy
'cause you know me inside out (inside out)
Inside out

So come on won't you give me something to remember?
Baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out
Even though we couldn't last forever, baby
You know what I want right now
Hit me one more time it's so amazing
How you shooked my world and flipped it upside down
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy
'cause you know me inside out (out, out, out)
