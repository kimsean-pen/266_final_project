We're manufacturing hearts, we've got the perfect thing
The word on the street, we've got the new love machine
Heart with an on and off switch and a remote control
Now you can program how you feel before you walk out the door

Find me out
I'm not just made of parts
Oh, you can break right through
This box you put me into

Well you can leave 'em hot and you can leave 'em cold
And you can give 'em what you want, you can get up and go
And you can take your heart out and you can put it back in
I think we found the way to put the fun back in sin

Find me out
I'm not just made of parts
Oh you can break right through
This box you put me into

Not like an organ, like a valentine
It's cherry, it's cherry red and it beats on time, time, time, time
We're trying to reduce that heart on heart crime
You bring your heart to us, we'll get it purified

Find me out
I'm not just made of parts
Oh you can break right through
This box you put me into

What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

Find me out
I'm not just made of parts
Oh you can break right through
This box you put me into
