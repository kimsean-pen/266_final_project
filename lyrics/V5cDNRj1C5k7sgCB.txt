Out of the quiet
Out of the sunrise
I hear the birdsong
Give way to sirens

I hear the voices
Give way to silence
It looks like fire
But it's just sunshine

Waters are rising
Forests are burning
Hearts always hurt more
While they are learning

Saying goodbye to
The ones they have come from
Saying goodbye to
The ones they have run from

Out of the sirens
Might come the birdsong
Out of the silence
Might come the love song

After the love song
Might come the sunrise
After the sunrise
Might come the silence...
