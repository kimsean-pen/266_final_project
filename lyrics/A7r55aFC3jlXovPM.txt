Chances to move mountains are few and far between
But only unseen by those who choose them to be
Live every day like it's your last chance to be heard and seen
Cause the good die young and the great change the course of history

Stop blending in and start speaking out
You'll never know what you can do if you don't try now
Lift up your eyes discouraged one
Keep moving forward until your battles have been won

They say you were created to do great things, but words only come to life when you believe
Stop blending in, start speaking out
Don't miss your opportunity

Do you have the courage to follow your heart? (follow your heart)
Your life could be over before you ever had a chance to start
Take what you can get while you can get it and don't let anybody stand in your way
If you've got what it takes, make them believe it
They need to hear you from a mile away

They say you were created to do great things
But words only come to life when you believe
Stop blending in, start speaking out
Don't miss your opportunity

Lift up your eyes discouraged one
When you feel like giving up, when they say it can't be done
It's up to you to show them why they're wrong

Lift up your eyes discouraged one
When you feel like giving up, when they say it can't be done
It's up to you to show them why they're wrong

Lift up your eyes discouraged one
When you feel like giving up, when they say it can't be done
Show them they're wrong!

What you do is up to you
Follow your heart and you will never lose

They say you were created to do great things, but words only come to life when you believe
You were created to do great things, but words only come to life when you believe
Stop blending in, start speaking out
Don't miss your opportunity

Reach for the sky
Nothing's impossible when you realize the strength is inside
Embrace the struggle when it's all you can see
Words only come to life when you believe
