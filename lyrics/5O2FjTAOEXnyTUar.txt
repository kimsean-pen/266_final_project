You'll be coming home soon
I know you're out of place
You knock on my door soon?
I just need to see your face

Ohhh, my heart is like a speeding train
Ohhh, my love, and I can feel your pain
All night long, yeah I prayed for you
Because I miss you
I am out of place, I am out of place

You'll be coming around soon
It's just not been the same
Is there something I can do for you
Have you got a soul to save?

Ohhh, my heart is like a speeding train
Ohhh, my love, I can feel your pain
All night long, yeah I prayed for you
Because I miss you
I am out of place, I am out of place

Ohhh, my heart is like a speeding train
Ohhh, my love, and I can feel your pain
All night long, yeah I prayed for you
Because I miss you
I am out of place, I am out of place

Ohhh, Because I miss you
I am out of place
Ohhh, Because I miss you
I am out of place, I am out of place

You'll be coming home soon
