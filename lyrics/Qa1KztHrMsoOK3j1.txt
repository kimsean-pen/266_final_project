I was thirteen
I was working, tryna get my hands on the first ding-a-ling
I was lurking
We were flirting
Babyboy oum can you be my king king
Kicked up, I been watchin you
(Watchin)
Kicked up, boy it's kinda rude
Boy I felt so alone, I just wanna get you home
Baby don't you wanna hear me moan
I don't mean to rush it, you can be my suspect
My cover can be blown
Traveling your timeline
Following your guidelines
Time is running out
I don't want you in this drought
He said I ain't waterproof
I ain't sick but I want your soup
And he said rain on me
He said Whack I ain't lyin
Girls like you are hard to find
He said rain on me, yeah
Clock keeps ticking
Cause it's you that I've been missing
I been waiting
Waiting
Clock keeps ticking
Cause it's you that I've been missing
I been waiting
For the right time
What is a girl supposed to do
When her hormones keep on yelling at you
I tell you the truth
Cause still you tell me to prove the point
I think I need to find better to do
I fell in the booth
It's unevitable
You tell me to choose and then you put a tack on my shoe
Forever confused
Never turn my back on ya boo
You ride with your crew and then I ride with my dude
I never thought this day would come (yo, yo)
I remmeber we were young (yo, yo)
It's the vision, we must complete our mission
In this love crime baby I play the victim, I miss him
That's what I reply when they listen
Question
Why I still love you from a distance?
Difference, I was just (?) when I wonder where we are
Then I wonder where you at
Where you at?
