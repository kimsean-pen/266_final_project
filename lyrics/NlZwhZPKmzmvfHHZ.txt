Sail away...

Say goodbye and close your eyes, let's drift away
Like a ship on the ocean, we'll set sail for a better day
Come live in a daydream, this is your wonderland
Let's swim in the deep sea, so jump in and take my hand

Dream away don't wait for the night
'cause any old time at all sounds good to me

Hello, you can open your eyes, we're almost there
Can you feel all the energy, there's magic everywhere
Come live in a daydream, create your destiny
Just let the feeling surround you and it will set you free
We've all got problems, don't let them get to you
And when your feeling down, there's only one thing to do

Dream away don't wait for the night
(Don't wait for the night to call)
'Cause any old time at all sounds good to me
Dream away, everything's alright
(Everyting's alright tonight)
I hope it sounds good to you, sounds good to me
Sounds good to me

We've all got problems, don't let them get to you
And when your feeling down, there's only one thing to do

Dream away don't wait for the night
(Don't wait for the night to call)
'cause any old time at all sounds good to me
Dream away, everything's alright
(Everyting's alright tonight)
I hope it sounds good to you, sounds good to me
Sounds good to me
I hope it sounds good to you
'cause it so sounds good to me
