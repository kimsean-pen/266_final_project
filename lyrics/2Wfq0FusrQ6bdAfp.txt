Send us a prophet, to warn the nation.
All the children in this creation,
All the people that you see
Will be the children of the Most High.

The hungry must be fed, so there'll be no more sufferation.
All the people that you see
Will be the children of the Most High.

All the people that you see
Will be the children of the Most High.
