I knew that we'd be more than friends
When I saw you shining
Somewhere in my heart I knew
Somewhere in my heart
Holding on to my belief
That you were another heart thief
Knew you'd pull my world apart
I knew it from the start

All the love you gave me
You know it made me strong
Feeling alive, now back to life
I know where I belong
I'll never let them break me
I'll never do no wrong
We're on fire, we're on fire
And we're burning up

I keep looking at you and it feels like
I've been staring at the sun, yeah, you hurt my eyes
Can't look away, can't look away
Hey, hey, hey

We just keep on rising
Faster than the lightning
Looking down on all below
Trying to keep control
Now the grip is tightening
Gonna keep on fighting
Somewhere in my heart I know
Somewhere in my heart

All the love you gave me
You know it made me strong
Feeling alive, now back to life
I know where I belong
I'll never let them break me
I'll never do no wrong
We're on fire, we're on fire
And we're burning up

I keep looking at you and it feels like
I've been staring at the sun, yeah, you hurt my eyes
Can't look away, can't look away
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I keep looking at you and it feels right
I've been staring at the sun, got me hypnotized
Can't look away, can't look away
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I need to see it, feel it, breathe it
Don't let the light go, light go
I need to see it, feel it, breathe it
Don't let the light go, light go

I keep looking at you and it feels like
I've been staring at the sun, yeah, you hurt my eyes

I keep looking at you and it feels like
I've been staring at the sun, yeah, you hurt my eyes
Can't look away, can't look away
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I keep looking at you and it feels right
I've been staring at the sun, got me hypnotized
Can't look away, can't look away
Hey, hey, hey, hey
