I'm not in love, I'm not in love
And there will be no future tense for us
I cannot lie, I know it isn't right to want you
Most of the time I stop myself from trying to touch you

I'm magnetized, I'm magnetized
I'm magnetized, I'm magnetized by you

You bring the light, I'll bring my pain
You bring your joy, I'll bring my shame
I want to kiss the scars that rips your shoulder
Get so close that it hurts
Every time I feel it's going closer
You pull back

I'm magnetized, I'm magnetized
(Magnetized by you)
I'm magnetized, I'm magnetized
(Magnetized by you)
I'm magnetized by you

There's nothing I can do
It's all a fantasy

I would risk everything
Set fire to the house
Pack my bags and walk out
But would you want me to
If I was free?

I'm not in love, I'm not in love
I'm not in love, I'm not in love
I'm not in love, I'm not in love
I'm not in love, I'm not in love

I'm magnetized by you
I'm magnetized by you
I'm magnetized by you
(Magnetized)
I'm magnetized by you
(I'm magnetized)
I'm magnetized by you
(I'm magnetized)
I'm magnetized by you
I'm magnetized by you

There's nothing I can do
It's all a fantasy
