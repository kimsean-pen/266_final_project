Your Wisdoms in the ocean
Deep under the surface
Where it's hard to breathe
You are guiding me
And you're like seed
Growing in everything
And you're like a seed
A flower opening

You're gentle
Like a spring rain yet you're sharp as a sunrise
Your generosity is the air all around me
And youre like a seed
Growing in everything
And you're like a seed
A flower opening...

You are a part of me
