When I look at you I get a good idea
Stay on the line until your voice feels nearer
I was meant for you said the psychic reader, yeah

When I look at you I get a good vibration
Stay on the line until I hit your station
I was meant for you so I can be patient, yeah

Am I hitting a wall?
Is it nothing at all?

I was in the room when you were leaning
It ended too soon when you fought the feeling

When I look at you I get a, get a rush
Stay on the line until I catch the right bus
I was meant for you, isn't it obvious

Am I hitting a wall?
Is it nothing at all?
