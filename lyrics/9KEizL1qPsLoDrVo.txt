strolin
through my dreams sequence
strolin through some kiss, darkness, holding a rose
lift into my nose not worth knowing
where im going
treded my way through an other haze
tossed my heart to the wind
hopeing to find some pice of mind
gravediggin' again and again
swollen eyes
hiding the tears from passing by
the other side
the smell of the roses
treded my way through an other haze
tossed my heart to the wind
hopeing to find some pice of mind
gravediggin' again and again
diggin, diggin, diggin, diggin, diggin, diggin, dggin, diggin
