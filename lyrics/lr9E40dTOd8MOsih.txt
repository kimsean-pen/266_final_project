Ups and downs, such a pain in the ass
Walls around me block my way
Ups and downs
Walls around me block my way

Yo boys and girls what's on your mind
Stop that bored face, you gotta have fun
I used to feel the same way and I got fed up of it
Who said there's no hope who said there's no hope
I don't think so, there's always a way
Who said there's no hope who said there's no hope
I don't think so, there's always a way

Does it mean the whole journey was pointless
How can I make a difference

Sometimes you might slam into a wall
But that's how I realize that I exist in this world
It's your chance to win the next game
So grab it jump up
It's waiting for you

Life isn't simple anymore, now that I see it with a wider view
I don't wanna come back and bite someone in the ass
So bring it on now it's time

Raise your voice against liars
Just imagine yourself out there
Nothing will change if you stay

振り返らなくていい
ただ見えている先へ

I'm gonna end this pathetic joke

答えが儚くても
1つだけ確かなこと
理由なんて無くてもいい
いつの瞬間も
息をして高鳴り
響き出す

It doesn't matter unless you don't give up
I just didn't realize it has always been there for me
Like a shining star
Always by my side

I'm not dumb, I'm gonna take a shot
If I can't hold on, my life won't change
All I need is to have a word with my fate
So bring it on

Rise up後悔なんてやめて全開で3, 2, 1
Jump up己のセンスでチャンスを掴め step by step

憧れていた無欠な人間なんて
どこにも居なくて
きっと誰もが同じで壁にぶち当たって
So let's blitz through one step at a time
There's nothing to be afraid of
You are who you are forever

Ha
