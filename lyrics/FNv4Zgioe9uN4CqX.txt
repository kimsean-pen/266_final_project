In the cool of the evening
When everything is gettin kind of groovy
You call me up and ask me
Would I like to go with you and see a movie
First I say no, I've got some plans for the night
And then I stop, and say, all right
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you

You always keep me guessin
I never seem to know what you are thinkin
And if a girl looks at you
It's for sure your little eye will be a-winkin
I get confused, cause I don't know where I stand
And then you smile, and hold my hand
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you
Spooky

If you decide someday to stop this little game that you are playin
I'm gonna tell you all the things my heart's been a-dyin to be sayin
Just like a ghost, you've been a-hauntin my dreams
So now i know, you're not what you seem
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you

Spooky, spooky, oh whoa, all right
Spooky, oh yea yea
I said Spooky yea yea
