Sometimes there's nothing to say
In the hard times
Do you know me
Or are we all lost in the game?

You can be a thousand to one
Or you can die alone
There's no disgrace
When no-one knows your name

Sometimes it hurts your heart
When you lose control
Do you see me?
Can I depend on you?

You can be a soldier of love
Or you can lose your soul
There's no time
To make sure it's all true

Give your blood and save me
Give your love and amaze me
I see you now
I know you see

Give a sucker an even break
Another emotion to fake
Down on me
Down on me

Sometimes it makes you laugh
In the darkness
Do you feel it?
Don't tell me no lies

You can be a God or a fool
It's your decision
Are you forbidden?
You can fight or die

Give your blood and save me
Give your love and amaze me
See it through
What can you be?

Give a sucker an even break
Another emotion to fake
Down on me
Down on me

Give your blood and save me
Give your love and amaze me
I see you now
And I know you see

Give a sucker an even break
Another emotion to fake
Down on me
Down on me

Give your hands to hold me
Give your arms to enfold me
Say the word
Set me free

Bring me in out from the storm
Keep me safe from scorn
Down on me
Down on me
