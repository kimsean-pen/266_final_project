Mirror mirror
How far will I go
Despite the foundation
I am falling
Sweet reflection
Will you save a place for me

Where am I heading
Could you grant me a haven
For what
I am punished, could I ever repent

Mother nature I'm wide open
Waiting for you to move me

Don't keep it from me
This is the free fall
This is the free fall

I never seem to understand
The time, the place, and who I am
Define a way to stay alive
It's like I'm living a lie

Father time
Every time I stop and feel
You're there to tell me
I'm already late

Don't keep it from me
This is a free fall

I never seem to understand
The time, the place, and who I am
It's like I'm living a lie

I never seem to understand
The time, the place, and who I am
Define a way to stay alive
It's like I'm living a lie

I never seem to understand
The time, the place, and who I am
Define a way to stay alive
It's like I'm living a lie
