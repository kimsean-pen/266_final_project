Under the surface (Under the surface)
Wires are crossed (Wires are crossed)
At any moment (At any moment)
I can go off

And I can't hold much longer
Keeps getting stronger
It's only a matter of time

I'm living like a landmine waiting to explode
I'm ticking like a time-bomb ready to go
I'm a danger to myself and everybody else I'm
Living like a landmine waiting to explode

I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go

Under the pressure (Under the pressure)
I'm not okay (I'm not okay)
I live in denial (I live in denial)
I've bottled the rage

And I can't hold much longer
Keeps getting stronger
It's only a matter of time

I'm living like a landmine waiting to explode
I'm ticking like a time-bomb ready to go
I'm a danger to myself and everybody else I'm
Living like a landmine waiting to explode

I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go

I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go

And I can't hold much longer
Keeps getting stronger
It's only a matter of time

I'm living like a landmine waiting to explode
I'm ticking like a time-bomb ready to go
I'm a danger to myself and everybody else I'm
Living like a landmine waiting to explode

I'm living like a landmine waiting to explode
I'm ticking like a time-bomb ready to go
I'm a danger to myself and everybody else I'm
Living like a landmine waiting to explode

I'm ready to go
(I'm ready to go)
(I'm ready to go)
(I'm ready to go)

I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
