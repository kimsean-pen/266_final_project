I got a twenty-dollar bill
That says, 'No one's ever seen you without makeup
You're always made up'
And I'm sick of your tattoos
And the way you always criticize the Smiths
And Morrissey

And I know that you're a sucker
For anything acoustic
But when I say let's keep in touch
I really mean, I wish that you'd grow up

This is the first song for your mix tape
And it's short just like your temper
Somewhat golden like the afternoons
We used to spend, before you got too cool

I got a twenty-dollar bill
That says, 'No one's ever seen you without makeup
You're always made up'
And I'm sick of your tattoos
And the way you don't appreciate Brand New
Or me

And I know that you're a sucker
For anything acoustic
But when I say let's keep in touch
I hope you know I mean I wish that you'd grow up

This is the first song for your mix tape
And it's short just like your temper
Somewhat golden like the afternoons
We used to spend, before you got too cool

Yeah, but I wish you were my shadow
Yeah, but I wish you were my shadow
Yeah, but I wish you were my shadow
