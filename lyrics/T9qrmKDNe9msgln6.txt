I can't get today, tell your five friends I'm ready for you
Keep our love distant, gettin' all back, I paid attention
Learn your ABCs
You tell me some lies much better than you keep our love
It's too hard
Hold yourself back the way I'm going

You give me your hands and I will shake you to the floor
You give me a piece and I will hit them out' the park
You give me your keys and I will take them for a walk
You give me your ears and I will blow until they're blown

God help ya
Wait until you get home
God help ya
Wait until you get home

Forgot I was a daughter, forgot I was a daughter
Forgot I was a daughter, forgot I was a daughter
