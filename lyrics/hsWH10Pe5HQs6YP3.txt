I'm the best you'll ever have
You're the best I'll never have

Pain...
Gone.
Rain...
Stop.
Sun...
Shine.
You're...
Mine.

Here kitty kitty kitty

MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY

Listen:
listen through the walls
the sound of quick footsteps sneaking down the hall
whispers
the pages turning
the leaky roof
the toilet flushing
numbers on the license plate

I'm nothing more than
The best you'll never have
A speck on your bedroom wall
A blood red waterfall

THE BEST YOU WILL EVER HAVE

Your dead things are locked up inside
Blow smoke rings straight back in time
Roses floating out with the tide
Dance and sing under gunfire
Open wings slowly take flight...

Around these parts a fly can live---
A fly can live a thousand years
but a man cannot die soon enough, true enough

A smiling drunk nursing a glass of milk
A girl with a face like prison bread
Over the kitchen noise I hear them howl at me

A scabby ketchup bottle and a two-dollar bill
I guess its time to pay the bill, but you know I never will
I'm hungry still...

RUN AWAY RUN AWAY RUN AWAY RUN AWAY

Mercy killing on the way
Never thought I'd hear you say
Falling to your knees and pray now...

In this crowded place I could swing a cat
And not even hit a soul...
It's just the lonely vacuum of human black holes

And I'm as dry as these thirsty trees
with big city thoughts in the dirty breeze...
promising to set me free
"waiter, check please..."

I'M THE BEST YOU WILL EVER HAVE
