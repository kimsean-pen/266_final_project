Oh my, my
What the hell have I done?
Dangled my life too close to the sun
Something's missing, no matter what I do
Oh my, my
It's you

And we got on
Like a House on Fire, like a House on Fire
Burning bright, and we were strong
Like a House on Fire, like a House on Fire
I light a match for every day
I've been alone, you've been away
I've been a liar, I've been a liar

Burn baby, burn
Set a flame to these walls
The art can't cover
The shame when it falls
The only thing breathing
Still standing when it's through
Oh my, my
It's you

And we got on
Like a house on fire, like a house on fire
Burning bright, and we were strong
Like a house on fire, like a house on fire
I light a match for every day
I've been alone, you've been away
I've been a liar, I've been a liar
Oh my, my
Oh my, my

Oh we got on
Like a house on fire, like a house on fire
Burning bright, and we were strong
Like a House on Fire, like a House on Fire
I light a match for every day
I've been alone, you've been away
I've been a liar, I've been a liar
'cause we belong
And we got on
Like a house on fire
