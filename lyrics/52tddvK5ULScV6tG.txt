Mister mister, won't you please
Spare me from your third degree
I could burn, I could scream
I could show you what I mean

I'm so thirsty I divest
All unbuttoned and undressed
I've become the bad guy
Taken hits and blackened eyes

Hey, I love you but you've hurt me so
I love you, won't you please let me go
I love you and I want you to know, oh oh oh
This is what love feels like, like, oh

I'm so desperate for relief
Thoughts I do not dare to speak
I am hungry, I won't lie
The cage, the bird, the open sky

Hey, I love you and I hurt you so
I love you, I don't want to go
I love you and I want you to know, oh oh oh
This is what love feels like, like

Hey, I love you and I feel like a stone
I love you and I want to go
I love you and I want you to know, oh oh oh
This is what love feels like, like

Oh my love, my love, my sweet love
My sweet love, my sweet love
Satisfy this longing
Indite me or let me fly
Though I still claim
I am not, I am not, I am not the bad guy

I still claim
I am not, I am not, I am not the bad guy
