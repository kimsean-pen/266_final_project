First off, bitch you know that I'm the hardest doll
First off, I'm the reaper standing at your door
First off, who told bitches they was so important?
First off, talking crazy, now you in the floor
First off, bitch you know that I'm the hardest doll
First off, I'm the reaper standing at your door
First off, who told bitches they was so important?
First off, talking crazy, now you in the floor

Running red lights, in a NASCAR
Never asking momma for some money, she never had none
Where my burner? Break a nigga, jelly jam, Jordan
You can take it how you want it, finna bitch I ran from
Say I'm problem jetted cause I'm really, really witty
Ate my pussy like a peanut, hold you tight just like a fitted
Project bitches, we call 'em birds
While we toot up, it gon' swerve
Broke ass nigga, on my nerves
Smoking, I swear, off the earth
Xan man, off a xan, popping rubber bands
I'm not fucking with these hoes, I rather dead presidents
Give me problems, shoot your body, pay to leave the evidence
I'm a rookie, sweeter cookies, I'm the bitch you can't defend

First off, bitch you know that I'm the hardest doll
First off, I'm the reaper standing at your door
First off, who told bitches they was so important?
First off, talking crazy, now you in the floor
First off, bitch you know that I'm the hardest doll
First off, I'm the reaper standing at your door
First off, who told bitches they was so important?
First off, talking crazy, now you in the floor

First off bitch, I'm that one, I'm not number two
Throw me your smoke residue
My truck white, word, the engine move
Bitter bitches more then you, I'm high up on my pedestal
You not in your bracket,
cause I'm passing, bitch I run shit in my tennis shoes
It's a show off, hardest hitter, role call
Diamond on my neck, Pinocchio you need a nose job
Oh you ain't no street bitch, you ain't never seen shit
Talking 'bout them dracos, you the type to cop a plea quick

(this a roll call, ey)
(this a roll call, ey)

First off, bitch you know that I'm the hardest doll
First off, I'm the reaper standing at your door
First off, who told bitches they was so important?
First off, talking crazy, now you in the floor
First off, I'm the hardest doll (where they at?)
First off, I'm the hardest doll (where they at?)
First off, I'm the hardest doll (where they at?)
First off, bitch I'm the hardest doll
First off, Asian grow call (grrrrraor)

I'm the hardest doll
Asian auto-parts
And I run 'em all
