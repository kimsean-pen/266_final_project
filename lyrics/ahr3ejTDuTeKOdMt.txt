You gave me something
I understand
You gave me loving
In the palm of my hand

I can't tell you how I feel
My heart is like a wheel

Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you

I wanna tell you
And now's the time
I wanna tell you that
You're going to be mine

I can't tell you how I feel
My heart is like a wheel

Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you

I can't tell you how I feel
My heart is like a wheel

Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
Let me roll it, I wanna roll
Let me roll it to you

Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
Let me roll it, I wanna roll
Let me roll it to you
