Pin the bunting on the gallows
Dance around it with your blackface on
And we all made a vacuum
We all made a vacuum for this
Throw your keys into the water
Come and crush me in a Waitrose aisle
You can strain till your tongue splits
Pounding me under your fist

We didn't think that it would happen and we never will
We didn't think that it would happen and we never will
Yeah I can think of nothing else but this, but this machine
I can think of nothing else but this, but this machine

I'm in my ivory ivory
I'm in my I'm in my ivory ivory I'm in
I'm in my ivory tower
I'm in my ivory
Hey they did enjoy unscrambling the brain
Of just a man
He didn't even think of anything
They didn't even think of it
All I learned from this
Was how much I could hate the state we're in
You'll find me in my tower

Do you know what makes me happy?
When I clothe you in a swarm of bees
And the world is my ashtray, the world is my ashtray tonight
Shave my head and call me monkey
Let me see you with the CAPS LOCK on
If we're all apoplectic then I'll be the nitpick alright

We didn't think that it would happen and we never will
We didn't think that it would happen and we never will
Yeah I can think of nothing else but this, but this machine
I can think of nothing else but this, but this machine

I'm in my ivory tower
I'm in my ivory ivory
I'm in my I'm in my ivory ivory I'm in
I'm in my ivory tower
I'm in my ivory
Hey they did enjoy unscrambling the brain
Of just a man
He didn't even think of anything
All I learned from this
Was how much I could hate the state we're in
Come find me in my tower

I'm in my ivory tower
I'm in my ivory ivory
I'm in my I'm in my ivory ivory I'm in
I'm in my ivory tower
I'm in my ivory ivory
I'm in my I'm in my ivory ivory I'm in
I'm in my ivory tower
I'm in my ivory ivory
I'm in my I'm in my ivory ivory I'm in
I'm in my ivory tower
I'm in my ivory ivory
I'm in my I'm in my ivory ivory I'm in
I'm in my ivory tower
I'm in my ivory ivory
I'm in my I'm in my ivory ivory I'm in
I'm in my ivory tower
I'm in my ivory ivory
I'm in my I'm in my ivory ivory I'm in
