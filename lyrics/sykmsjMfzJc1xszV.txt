And when the sun, it turns to snow
And the grass doesn't grow
Don't laugh, I love you
I could look outside my window every day
But you wouldn't be there to there come and play
Don't laugh, I love you

Ernest Hemingway (Ernest Hemingway)
Would always be there for me (Would always be there for me)
But now (Ernest Hemingway) Ernest Hemingway is dead (is dead now)

If I could get you back someday
Don't you say you're going away
Don't laugh, I love you
And if you locked me in the sun
To the tinkle I would run
Don't laugh, I love you

Nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu
Nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
Don't laugh, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
