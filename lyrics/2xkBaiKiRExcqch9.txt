Our love is an endless river
keeps on flowing on and on forever
each dream like a forest flower
keeps on growing every hour

We can almost touch the horizon there
so reaching further
we can even light up a star ahead
I know we are bound by destiny
we will always be

You to me are everything
you to me are everything
my whole world's devoted to you
for you there's not a thing I wouldn't do
you to me are everything

Our love is a perfect circle
has no start or end
It can't be broken
stronger than a moment's weakness
it knows no secrets
we both believe it

No one's ever gonna come between
the love we're sharing
no one's gonna steal the way we got dream
'cause there's more to words that words can say
How can I explain?

You to me are everything
you to me are everything
my whole world's devoted to you
for you there's not a thing I wouldn't do
you to me are everything

You to me are everything
you to me are everything
you to me are everything
you to me are everything
you to me are everything
