Oh if you'd never said anything
If you'd never said anything
If you never, if you never
If you never
If you'd never said anything

If you never, if you never
Ooh
If you never, if you never
If you never, if you never
Ooh
If you never, if you never

Here it is, in my hands
In my veins... and over lands
It spreads like fire... seeking air
And pulls me in my own funfair
Won't you come, won't you come,
Won't you come just don't say a word
Won't you come, won't you come,
Won't you come just don't say a word

If you never, if you never
Just don't say a word
If you never, if you never
Just don't say a word

I'm more alive, I've ever been
So now I give you all my sins
I've chosen you... I've chosen you
But don't say a word

And if I save us, and I fall down
I will leave your words behind now
If you never, held me under... If you never hear my thunder

If you never, if you never
If you never, if you never
If you never, if you never
Ooh
If you never, if you never
Just don't say a word
