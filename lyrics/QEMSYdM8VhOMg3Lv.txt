All alone you say that you don't want no other
So the Lord is love and love is like no other
If the falling tide can turn and then recover
All alone we must be part of one another

All alone you say, the power is perfection
Is the power of peace or merely the connection
To the God of love that powers the protection
From the tide of life that flows in each direction

When the stream of changing days
Turns around in so many ways
Then the pilot of the mind must find
The right direction

All alone you say that you don't want no other
So the Lord is love and love is like no other
If the falling tide can turn and then recover
All alone we must be part of one another

When the stream of changing days
Turns around in so many ways
Then the pilot of the mind must find
The right direction

All alone you say that you don't want no other
All alone you say that you don't want no other
All alone you say that you don't want no other
All alone you say that you don't want no other
