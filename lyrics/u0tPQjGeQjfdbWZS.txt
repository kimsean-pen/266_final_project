It starts with another day alone in your car
There's going to be another way for me to get to you
This distance is real, my heart burns at the wheel
There's going to be another way for me to get to you

I saw you leaning on the hood of my car
we're not leaving here, we're not leaving here
I need to be with you alone in my arms
I am dying here, I am dying here

We're not home, we're not home
We're laying wide awake, we're always wide awake

It starts with another day alone in your room
I wish I had the time to stay but it's something I have to do
This distance is real and you're dying to feel
There's going to be another way for me to get to you

I saw you leaning on the hood of my car
we're not leaving here, we're not leaving here
I need to be with you alone in my arms
I am dying here, I am dying here

We're not home, we're not home
We're laying wide awake, we're always wide awake
