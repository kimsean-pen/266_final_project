God came down and it asked me, "Are you trusting?"
And I didn't know what to say.
I cannot decide!

Lead 'cause it's what they want,
And it's what they need.
But for me it's not.

All and all I want to trust that we are not alone.
Comfort in believing
Guiding hands are leading.

Overly skeptic, I'm isolated.
I'll never prove it so it seems.

Crosses for freedom.
Suffocate syndrome.

God showed up to tell me what it thought
"And even if you don't believe, there are those who still need me."
I reply, "The safety of your name
Isn't something I deny, but I may not feel the same."
Then silence set.

We are the people that cannot be trusted to
Lead, like we want, like we need.
But for me it's about whether I can
Agree that the skies are watching.
Eyes up above always judging.

Telling me its thoughts
"And even if you don't believe, there are those who still need me."
I reply, "The safety of your name
Isn't something I deny, but I may not feel the same."

As we have the conversation.
I express my indecision.
Living now instead of living for an afterlife.

Crosses for freedom.
Suffocate syndrome.
Crosses now freed
Of the suffocating syndrome.
