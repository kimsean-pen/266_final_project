I wouldn't really mind
A 20 hour drive
With you on the other end
Filling up my tired head
Tell me all my favorite things you've said before

You know I'd make the time
I'm just waiting on your green light
Yeah, I'll be at your porch
By this time tomorrow
'Cause I'm almost not fine
But I'd never let you know

'Cause your moonlit backseat
Always leaves me somewhere inside
The softest part of my mind
And keeps me

Powerless tonight
All I am is losing track of time
Tell me why
You're the only one that makes me
Powerless tonight
All I am is losing track of time
Tell me why
You never really missed me back

I really wouldn't mind
My fear of taking flights
With you on the other side
Lifting up my tired eyes
Tell me something new you haven't told before

Let's meet in Anaheim
I'm sick of waiting for the "right time"
'Cause I'll be out of Texas by this time tomorrow
Distance makes the heart grow fonder
But I've found her

'Cause your moonlit backseat
Always leaves me somewhere inside
The softest part of my mind
And keeps me

Powerless tonight
All I am is losing track of time
Tell me why
You're the only one that makes me
Powerless tonight
All I am is losing track of time
Tell me why
You never really missed me back

I want you to need me like I need you
I need you to see me when I'm see-through
It's sad but it's true:
No one's waiting for you
But I was thinking we could get away sometime
Yeah, let's call it a date
And you can devastate my personal space
I never liked it anyway

'Cause your moonlit backseat
Always leaves me somewhere inside
The softest part of my mind
And keeps me

Powerless tonight
All I am is losing track of time
Tell me why
You're the only one that makes me
Powerless tonight
All I am is losing track of time
Tell me why
You never really missed me back
