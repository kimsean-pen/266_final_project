Ohh!
Yeah!
So much for first single on this one
Shady's the label
Aftermath is the stable
That the horses come outta-erra
Of course we're about to stir up
Some shit thick as Ms. Butterworth's syrup
It's the Mr. Picked-on-Christopher-Reeves
Just for no reason other than-uh just to tease him
Cause he was his biggest fan
He used to be Superman
Now we're pourin liquor on the curb in his name for him
"Eminem you wait 'til we meet up again
Fucker
I'm kickin' your ass for everything you've ever said!"
It goes one for the money two for the fuckin' show
Ready get set, let's go
Here comes the buckin' bronco stompin' and stampedin' up the damn street
Like them buffalo soldiers, I told ya I'm 'bout to blow
So look out below, Geronimo, motherfuckers is dominos
I'm on a roll, around and around I go
When will I stop I don't know
Tryna pick up where The Eminem Show left off
But I know
anything's possible
Though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game
That shit is not gonna change
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team
I'll get away with murder
I'm like O.J., he's like my Cochran today
We keep the Mark Furman tapes
In a safe, locked them away
Better watch what you say
Just when you thought you were safe
Them fuckers got you on tape
You swear to God you was playin'
Whether or not you was little Joshua

Gosh I wish I coulda told you to not do the same
Cuz one day it could cost you your name
And this was supposed to be my first single

But I just fucked that up so

Fuck it, let's all have fun let's mingle
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh No

Erra Erra Eric swallowed some generic sleeping pills
And woke up in bed next to his best friend Derrick bare naked

chicka-chicka-chicka
Janine just turned 15 and used a fake ID
to sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly
Hehehehehe, to be so young and naive
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and care free
Paris and Nicky's parents must be so tickled to cherish
Every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks
Hickory dickory Dirk Diggler
Look at me work wizardry with these words
Am I a jerk or just jerk chicken
Or chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka jer-jer-jerkin' the chain
22 jerks in a jerk circle
Or is it a circle jerk or wait a minute
What am I sayin', allow me to run it back and rewind it
rrrbb
Wait
Lemme ask you again
Am I just jerkin' your chain
Am I berzerk or insane
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs
Workin' the damn camera filmin' one of them

Paris Hilton homemade pornos
Who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle

chicka-chicka
Just recently somebody just discovered
Britney and Justin videotapes of them fuckin'

When they were just Mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club
And dusted them and went straight to The Source with them

Cause they coulda sworn someone said "nuh-"

And then tried to erase and record over it
But, if you listen close enough to it you can hear the
uhh-uhh and then they come-to find out it was-Justin
sayin' "I'm gon-na come" 'n' this was, su-pposed to be my first single

But I just fucked that up so
Fuck it, let's all have fun let's mingle
Slap a bitch and smack a ho

This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle

Any opinions or somethin you just wanna get off your chest
And address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1-800-I'm a dick sucker I love to suck a dick

And if someone picks up you can talk all the shit you want about me

Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back

As soon as there comes a day that I fall out with Dre
Wake up gay, make up with Ray (Hey!)

So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken
Beat a chicken, eat a chicken like it's a big cock bawka-bi-kaw
Or suck a dick, and lick a dick and eat a dick
And stick a dick in your mouth
I'm done you can fuck off
fucka-fuck offf!
And this was supposed to be my first single
But I just fucked that up so
Fuck it, let's all have fun let's mingle
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle
