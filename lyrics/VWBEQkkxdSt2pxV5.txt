Some say that nothing's ever bound to last
There's no way that you can ever stop the crash

But I say let the rain
Let the rain come down
Let it weaken the ground
Cause we will stand forever

Unbreakable, unshakable
Built a house on the rock that will never fall
So unbreakable
Another broken heart
From a world apart
Now we're stronger than ever, that's what we are
So unbreakable

We fight, never easy keeping what we had
We cry, but we always find a way to laugh

So I say hold me close
Don't let go, don't you dare let go
And we will stand forever

Unbreakable, unshakable
Built a house on the rock that will never fall
So unbreakable
Another broken heart
From a world apart
Now we're stronger than ever, that's what we are
So unbreakable

And I say yeah
Nothing worth having is easy
I say yeah
But as long as we're together we know

We're unbreakable
We're unbreakable

Unbreakable, unshakable
Built a house on the rock that will never fall
So unbreakable
Another broken heart
From a world apart
Now we're stronger than ever, that's what we are
So unbreakable

Unbreakable, unshakable...
