You locked your heart
You wake up with tears and stars in your eyes
You gave it all to someone that
Cannot love you back

Your days are packed
With wishes and hopes for the love that you've got
You waste it all to someone that
Cannot love you back

Someone that cannot love

Love, ain't this enough
You push yourself down
You try to take comfort in words
But words
They cannot love
Don't waste them like that
'Cause they'll bruise you more

You secretly made
Castles of sand that you hide in the shade
But you cannot hold the tides that break them
And you build them all over again

You talk all these words
You make conversations that cannot be heard
How long until you notice that
No one is answering back

Someone that cannot love

Love, ain't this enough
You push yourself down
You try to take comfort in words
But words
They cannot love
Don't waste them like that
'Cause they'll bruise you more

Love, love, ain't this enough
Pushing around
You try to take comfort in words
But words
Well they cannot love
Don't waste them like that
'Cause they'll bruise you more

Someone that cannot love

Someone that cannot love
Someone that cannot love

Love, ain't this enough
You push yourself down
You try to take comfort in words
But words
They cannot love
Don't waste them like that
'Cause they'll bruise you more

Love, love, ain't this enough
Pushing around
To find little comfort in words
But words
Well they cannot love
Don't waste them like that
'Cause they'll bruise you more

You know they'll bruise you more
Words they will hurt you more
Words they will hurt you more

Yes they'll bruise you
Someone that cannot love
Someone that cannot love
