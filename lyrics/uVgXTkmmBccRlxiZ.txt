Get drunk a lot
And work 40 hours a week
Spend half your time
Hung over, sick and weak

Make sure to tell yourself that this is cool
And make sure to tell yourself that you have no choice
And make sure to tell your friends that they drive you to it
And that you can quit anytime
That you want, anytime
You can quit
Anytime
That you want
You can quit
Anytime
You can quit

Party down, party down
Drinkin' til you can't even see
(?)In your car with your buddies
And wrap it around a tree

Make sure to tell yourself that this is cool
And make sure to tell yourself that you have no choice
And make sure to tell your friends that they drive you to it
And that you can quit anytime

You can quit

Feelin' pretty petty
Lying cold in a hospital bed
Busted car, busted head
You had a friend but now he's dead

Make sure to tell yourself that this is cool
And make sure to tell yourself that you have no choice
And make sure to tell your friends that they drive you to it
And that you can quit anytime
