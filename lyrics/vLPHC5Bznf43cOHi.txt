I'm on the low
to call my soul

the breath will melt
and you're out alone
If this is what you want
Take it from my bones
Write your name in blood

Let it all go
'Cause love like this won't grow
The calm is when
For the games I've played

My mind was made up
But your breath still messin' on
If this is what you want
Take it from my bones
Write your name in blood
Let it all go
Let it all go
Let it all go
Let it all go
Let it all go
Let it all go
Let it all go
Let it all go
Let it all go
'Cause love like this won't grow
