My friend, you lost your head again
Hot hands, you're on to my neck
A drug test and you're still failing me
All you do is take, take, take
Black boots and her French heritage
She's scaring me with your friends
She's 20 now and ahead of it again
While I'm still afraid, afraid, afraid
Do you get afraid, afraid, afraid?
Show me the water
Swim deep 'til you come home
It's all that we've wanted
And all that you've ever known
Swim deep, you gotta make it better
I'll be waiting on you forever
Swim with me, get to someplace better
I'll be waiting on you forever
My friend, are you still wide awake?
My hands, they cover your eyes
'Cause I've been living out in silence now
And I stumble, I stumble the night
Yeah I stumble, I stumble the night
Show me the water
Swim deep 'til you come home
It's all that we've wanted
And all that you've ever known
Swim deep, you gotta make it better
I'll be waiting on you forever
Swim with me, get to someplace better
I'll be waiting on you forever
Show me the water
Swim deep 'til you come home
It's all that we've wanted
And all that you've ever known
