She cooks you sweet potato
You don't like aubergine
She knows to boil the kettle
When you hum bars from 'Grease'
She senses you are lonely
But still she can't be sure
And so she stands and waits
Stands anticipating (your thoughts)

How can she become the psychic
That she longs to be, to understand you
How can she become the psychic
That she longs to be, to understand you

He brushes thoroughly
He know she likes fresh breath
He rushes to the station
He waits atop the steps
He's brought with him a Mars bar
She will not buy Nestl√©
And later he'll perform
A love-lorn serenade, a trade

How can he become the psychic
That he longs to be, to understand you
How can he become the psychic
That he longs to be, to understand you

So give her information to help her fill the holes
Give an ounce of power so he does not feel controlled
Help her to acknowledge the pain that you are in
Give to him a glimpse of that beneath your skin

Now my inner dialogue is heaving with detest
I am a martyr and a victim and I need to be caressed
I hate that you negate me, I'm a ghost at beck and call
I'm failing and placating, and berating myself for staying
I'm a fool, I'm a fool

He greets the stranger meekly a thing that she accepts
She sees him waiting often with chocolate on the steps
He senses she is lonely she's glad they finally met
They take each other's hands walk into the sunset

Do you like sweet potato?
