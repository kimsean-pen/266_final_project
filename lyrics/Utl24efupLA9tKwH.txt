Albatross, albatross
How callous the ocean you cross?

I, I blame you, I blame you
For all of those things I've been through
Don't feel bad, don't upend
It's my neck around which you hang

Like a chain or a tag
I flinch and you fall through the cracks
To the sea and all it bears
The secrets that I should've shared

Drown in me
Yeah, they drown in me
Yeah, they drown in me

I, I blame you, I blame you
For all of those things I've been through
Don't feel bad, don't upend
It's my neck around which you hang

Like a chain or a tag
I flinch and you fall through the cracks
To the sea and all it bears
The secrets that I should've shared
Drown in me
Yeah, they drown in me
Yeah, they drown in me
Albatross, albatross
Which way to turn when we're lost?
