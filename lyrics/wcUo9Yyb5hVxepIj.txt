I was higher than the nosebleed, I
I would turn up 'til my nose bleed, I
Blacked out in the black car, I
Was trying to feel like a rockstar, but
I can't just do one now, no
I've been way too numb now
I'm livin' on the run now
Oh, I gotta get out of this town somehow

'Cause the bads been
Slowly gettin' worse
And this fast lane
Livin' it's a curse
Better tell me
What's your life worth?
I think it's time for a change

'Cause the bads been
Slowly gettin' worse
And this fast lane
Livin' it's a curse
Better tell me
What's your life worth?
I think it's time for a change

'Cause the drugs don't work
Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work
Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work

I couldn't find the thrill again, I
Couldn't seem to kill the pain, I
I was living in the moment
Searchin' for a little serotonin, but
This shit ain't so fun now, I
Can't tell with the come down, I
Been livin' on the run now
Oh, I gotta get out of this town somehow

'Cause the bads been
Slowly gettin' worse
And this fast lane
Livin' it's a curse
Better tell me
What's your life worth?
I think its time for a change

'Cause the bads been
Slowly gettin' worse
And this fast lane
Livin' it's a curse
Better tell me
What's your life worth?
I think it's time for a change

'Cause the drugs don't work
Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work
Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work
Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work
Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work

Woo, Woo, Woo, Woo
