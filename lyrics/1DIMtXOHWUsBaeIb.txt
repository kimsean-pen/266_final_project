Fresh cut grass, one cold beer.
Thank the Lord I am here and now, here and now.
Summer dress, favorite park.
Bless your soul we are here and now, here and now.

I'm wide awake,
so what's the point of dreaming when your life is great?
Celebrate the feeling
Celebrate the feeling

Can't complain about much these days, I believe we'll be okay.
Oh oh oho oh oh oho
Can't complain about much these days, I believe we'll be okay.
Oh oh oho oh oh oho
We're screaming out, I believe we'll be okay.

Sun kissed skin on my lips.
Thank the Lord I am here and now, here and now.
Fireflies after dark.
Bless your soul we are here and now, here and now.

I'm wide awake,
so what's the point of dreaming when your life is great?
Celebrate the feeling
Celebrate the feeling

Can't complain about much these days, I believe we'll be okay.
Oh oh oho oh oh oho
Can't complain about much these days, I believe we'll be okay.
Oh oh oho oh oh oho
We're screaming out, I believe we'll be okay.

We'll be okay. We'll be okay.
Can't complain about much these days, I believe we'll be okay.

Can't complain about much these days, I believe we'll be okay.
Oh oh oho oh oh oho
Can't complain about much these days, I believe we'll be okay.
Oh oh oho oh oh oho
We're screaming out out, I believe we'll be okay.
