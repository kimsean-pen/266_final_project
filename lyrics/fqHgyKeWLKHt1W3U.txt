"Hello?"
"Hello, mother leopard. I have your cub.
You must protect her, but that will be expensive.
10, 000 cola nuts, wrapped in brown paper.
Midnight, behind the box. I'll be the hyena, you'll see."

This could last us all a lifetime
Limbs intact, untouched
On the screen of a video tape
Confined to bedposts we wait as lepers
Upheld at knife's reach,
Oh, we covet all the status quo.
This syringe will take a lifespan
It's filled with bait and tackle
Try and catch us if you can...

Un-un-unconscious tied and gagged

Meet us at the corner of 5th and Pontiac.
But make sure that no one else is with you,
If you wish to see them alive again.
Then humor me with this request,
Humor me with this request!
In basements we will hide,
Amnesia in our alibis...
