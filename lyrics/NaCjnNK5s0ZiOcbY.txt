When you told me you were leaving
Well, I couldn't feel my mouth
'cause all I'll ever be is someone else
As I watched you walk away
I felt something in me change
My heart froze over, all emotion dripped away

So I drove home
At a hundred miles an hour
Just to see what it feels like to fly
And I crashed my car
Into someone else's backyard

Just to see what it feels like to die

When you told me that you missed me
Well I couldn't close my eyes
'cause I realized what it felt like to die
'Cause all you'll ever be

Is a nightmare and a wet dream,
A reason to smile from six feet under ground

So I drove home
At a hundred miles an hour
Just to see what it feels like to die

And I crashed my car
Into someone else's backyard
Just to see what it feels like to die

So bathe me in pale flesh
Promise that I'll never be good again
I hope you miss me when I'm gone
Because I can't hold on for too long
And I'm so scared of dying alone
That I'll kill myself right here, right now

And I'll die
And I'll die
And I'll die
And I'll die
And I'll die
And I'll die
And I'll die

And I'll die
And I'll die
And I'll die
And I'll die
And I'll die
And I'll die
And I'll die
