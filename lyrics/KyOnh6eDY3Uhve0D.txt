Looking through your window
Maybe you're not home, oh
I tried to call your number
So now I'll leave another message on your phone, oh oh oh yeah

I'm not a stalker
I just got to know
How it feels when I hold you close
So tell me what you like
'Cause I'm running out of time

Promise you I'm not insane
Something about you that I can't explain
I'm going out of my mind

Yeah all I wanna do
Is make love to you
I'll hold you tight
Treat your body right

All I wanna do
Is stay the night with you
I'll hold you tight
Treat your body right, yeah

I'll hold you tight
Treat your body right, yeah

Staring at your picture
It's hanging on my wall
Yeah I even called your mama
To ask her how to get through to your heart
And I said

I'm not a stalker

How it feels when I hold her close
So tell me what she likes
'Cause I'm running out of time

Promise you I'm not insane
Something about her that I can't explain

Yeah all I wanna do
Is make love to you
