Why me?
Why am I down?
Why feel
I'm not whole?
Why feel
so far below?
I'm free to go

Why dream?
Why partake?
Why be half
of a weak embrace
of time
and place
and lose space?

Deep down inside
I know the reasons, reasons
In faces I see lies
While they try to hide their eyes
Man, it hurts inside
It's like treason, treason, treason, treason

Soft ground
politics
Inside
dealing tricks
I can't
pick a side
you decide

What plan?
What design?
Can they
have in mind?
Have they
lost their minds?
Have I lost mine?

It's never just black or white
I know the reasons, reasons,
What I feel makes me alive
Ggoes beyond what they decide
Can't fight what gives you life
That's treason, treason, treason, treason
