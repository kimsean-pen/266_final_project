Good morning, silence
Good morning to myself
Good morning to the pain
In the center of my chest
It's crazy how much I miss
A simple good morning kiss, oh, oh

Good mourning, independence
Or is it loneliness?
I know I said I wanted this
But I have regrets
I pray for God's will to be done
The very next day you were gone, oh oh

A good mourning to the harsh realities of life
Oh and good mourning to the fact
We're not husband and wife
We made a promise to stay
Destiny got in the way, oh, oh, good mourning

Good morning, acceptance
Good morning, inner strength
I'm loving every moment, even the strain

It's crazy how much I miss
A simple good morning kiss, oh, oh
It's crazy how much I've missed
Now it's time for me to live, oh, oh, good mourning

Good morning, optimism
Good morning to my faith
Good morning to the beginning
Of a brand new day

I know that God's will will be done
So I lay down my pain and I'm moving on
I know that God's will will be done
So it's a good morning after all
