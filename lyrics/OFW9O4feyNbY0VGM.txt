8 bits...

Every day I look the same,
And the sun is always showing.
I look out, and there is 3D.
I keep looking down and miss my shadow.

Every day my hair is fine,
But one dot keeps changing colors.
I know my heritage is noble,
But still I feel like I'm a clone.

8 bits are enough for me,
This is not where I should be.
My life is more than information,
I want a life beyond emulation.

8 bits are enough for me,
This is not where I should be.
My life is more than information,
I want a life beyond emulation.

I look out and everything's too fast for me,
And I feel there must be more.
Every day I dream of where I've come from,
Now I know I'm just an emulation.

The next time I see the serial cable,
I jump on the train and leave this world.
Now I'm an original, I'm like my ancestors.
And my hair is finally all yellow.

8 bits are enough for me,
This is not where I should be.
My life is more than information,
I want a life beyond emulation.

8 bits are enough for me,
This is not where I should be.

8 bits are enough for me,

My life is more than information,
I want a life beyond emulation.

8 bits are enough for me,

I want a life beyond emulation.

8 bits are enough for me,

I want a life beyond emulation.
