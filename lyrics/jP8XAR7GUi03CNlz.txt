Baby got goin' on a southern train, you know
Fired up pistons drivin' below
And the whole vibration, seat upholstery
Silky underwear, oh conductor let's roll, roll, roll, roll
Let's roll, roll, roll, roll, roll

Baby got goin' but I can't complain, you know
It knocks me out when she acts so strange
It's like a big mac truck cut across two lanes in my soul
Conductor, let's throw some metal down, roll, roll, roll, roll
Let's roll, roll, roll, roll, roll

Baby got goin' when the train kept a rollin'
Baby got goin' when the train kept a rollin'
Baby got goin' when the train kept a rollin'
Baby got goin' when the train kept a rollin'

Squeeze her knees underneath a book, you know
A real good shakin' is all it took
'Cause my baby's hooked on me
And as you can see I'm wild about her

She got goin' but I can't complain, you know
It knocks me out when she acts so strange
It's like a big mac truck cut across two lanes in my soul
Conductor let's throw some metal down, roll
Let's roll, roll, roll, roll, roll
Let's roll

She gets mad when it goes too slow
So I'm beggin' you man keep shovelin' that coal and let's roll
Let's roll

Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll
