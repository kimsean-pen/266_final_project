(Lead vocal - Chris Rainbow)

Watching waiting rising falling
Listening calling Drifting
Touching feeling seeing believing
Hoping sending leaving
I couldn't say why you and I are gemini
If I tried to write a Million words a day
I see your shadow coming closer
Then watch you drifting away

Watching Waiting rising falling
Listening calling Drifting
Touching feeling seeing believing
Hoping Sending leaving
I couldn't say why you and I are gemini
We are travelling a million worlds away
I see your Shadow coming closer
Then watch you drifting away
