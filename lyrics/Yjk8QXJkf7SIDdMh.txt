So soft, so gentle this rose is kind and still
With change comes hatred now time to kill

I've heard it all, I know I cared too much
But It's cruel I'd let you die
I'll take the fall, I'll be the heartless one
My veins are made of ice

Well, I'm not afraid to take the world on myself
But if I can't have it all then no one will

Nothing's gonna save me
The evil that I see has taken over me
No ones gonna save me
The damage has been done I'm righting all the wrongs
I'm relentless like you made me

You fool!

Intentions once pure and simple, now sinister and sharp
I was weak I would fall for a promise I had no guard

Been through the worse, I've seeing the purest soul
Fill up with such disdain
Watching them fall trying to take me out
I see your foolish games

Well, I'm not afraid to take the world on myself
But if I can't have it all, then no one will

Nothing's gonna save me
The evil that I see has taken over me
No ones gonna save me
The damage has been done, I'm righting all the wrongs
I'm relentless like you made me

Rotten to the core sacred vows are torn
Can't expect a snake to be sheep
Can't expect a lair not to cheat

Rotten to the core sacred vows are torn
Can't expect a snake to be sheep
Can't expect a lair not to cheat

I'm not afraid to take the world on myself
But if I can't have it all then no one will

Nothing's gonna save me
The evil that I see has taken over me
No ones gonna save me
The damage has been done, I'm righting all the wrongs
I'm relentless like you made me
