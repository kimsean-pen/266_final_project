Let's stop awhile I'd let you dead But it's on my hands You
saw me in you smile that had gray crash Something I understand

Last one to know
The ways are rust it all
The last something die
Let it every know

In the end I guess we never had a chance
We teach you come to
Come to realize it all good days will last like I you
Can you save me from the world of gray
Show me something in this whole world saying
So so my heart will stop beating again

I'm sell a wd to someone front fraud I will sell was yours
All I passing by that's all the way
Does feel the same

Last one it all
'Cause on my silver loan
The last someone to die
Let it every night

In the end I guess we never had a chance
We teach you come to
Come to realize it all good good will last like I you
Can you save me from in the end sorrow
Give me something to hold up for tomorrow
So so my heart will stop beating again

Sometimes it feels like all did back a time
Really need to hear you saying one more time
Sometimes it feels like the walls are closing in
Did it easy you be there in the end
