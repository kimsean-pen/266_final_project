World eater

As silence roars through gathered masses
You stared waiting eagerly
Approaching darkness decreasing your life expectancy

The tension is now rising
The calm before the storm
See your life flash before you
Will you live to see the dawn?

The enemy is now approaching
With bloodlust in their eyes
Intense fear is overcoming
For now death - you will defy

As the battle raged all dead and wounded
Bodies, carnage all you see
The white hot blast - melting flesh
The screaming pain in agony

You stand alone
The final parody
As you realize - your mortality
For you cannot change your destiny
To die at the hands - of the unknown enemy
Your death - you can't deter
As the silence - returns
