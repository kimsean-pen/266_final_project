Why did you have to die?
You left me broken and alone with a long life.
How could you watch me fall to pieces?
If you don't know who you are at this point, find yourself something to lose.
If you don't know who you were before, disengage, start anew.
How could you watch me crumble?
Over my faith did I slip and stumble.
How could you watch me claw the skin right off my f**king bones?
If you don't know who you are at this point, find yourself something to lose.
If you don't know who you were before, disengage, start anew.
I watched you fall to pieces, again and again.
I won't let you die without a fight.
If you don't know who you are at this point, find yourself something to lose.
If you don't know who you were before, disengage, start anew.
