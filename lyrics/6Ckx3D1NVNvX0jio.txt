Melvin Harold And The Blue Notes
Miscellaneous

If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me
If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me

All the things that we've been through
You should understand me like I understand you
Now baby I know the difference between right and wrong

I ain't gonna do nothing to upset our happy home
Oh don't get so excited
When I come home a little late at night
'Cause we only act like children
When we argue, fuss and fight
If you don't know me by now

You will never never never know me
If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me
No you won't, hey hey
We've all got our own funny moods
I've got mine, woman you've got yours too
Just trust in me
Like I trust in you
As long as we've been together
That should be so easy to do
Just get yourself together
Or we might as well say goodbye
What good is a love affair
When we can't see eye to eye
If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me
If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me
No you won't
If you don't know me by now
Ten long years
Ten long years we've been together
You will never never never know me
