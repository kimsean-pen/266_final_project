This is where the summer ends.
In a flash of pure destruction, no one wins.
Go nuclear, nuclear.
The violets in my eyelids goin' red
Sentimental geek.
Shut up and go to sleep.

Oh ohhhhhh.

The calm, the beach and the remains.
Of the bathing suits and Porsches all in flames.
Go nuclear, nuclear.
When I saw her and the Yankees lost to the Braves.
Sentimental geek. Sentimental Geek. Sentimental Geek.
Shut up and go to sleep.

Give me an answer...
