Oooooo...
Tears are falling from our eyes
Oh, why ask why?
Isn't this the moment we wait all life for?
Can this be true?
Have I found you?
A manifest of silent cries
Oh please don't lie
I don't think that I can endure one more fall
Took me away
Never ending holiday
Can you feel the weather inside me?
Crash into the shore
Oh, can't you see the storm inside my eyes?
Crying out for more
Take a risk and try to fly
Come on let's dive
Isn't this the reason heaven was made for?
If we should die
We're in paradise
Shall we stay another day?
You show no shame
I finally see how I can make room for
One more life
Oh, one more life
Can you feel the weather inside me?
Crash into the shore
Oh, can't you see the storm inside my eyes?
Crying out for more
Where do you want to go?
Who do you want to be?
What do you want to do?
Aren't you tired of all the fear?
Which way do you want to fly?
Please don't let me close the door
Aren't you tired of all the fear?
Tell me, what do you want to do?
Where do you want to go?
Who do you want to be?
Aren't you tired of all the fear?
Which way do you want to fly?
I won't let you close the door
Aren't you tired of all the fear?
Tell me, where do you want to go?
Tell me can you see the storm?
The storm inside my eyes
Storm inside my eyes
