When the coldest year gets colder
Where you gonna run?
When your heavy heart gets older
Did you have your fun?

Got a heavy little heart
Inside you
You got a heavy little heart
Beside you

When the people that believe you
Grow tired of the silence
And the fear that wants to see you
Is hiding 'round the bend

Got a heavy little heart
Inside you
You got a heavy little heart
Beside you

You got a heavy little heart
You got a heavy little heart
You got a heavy little heart
You got a heavy little heart

You got a heavy little heart
You got a heavy little heart
You got a heavy little heart
You got a heavy little heart
