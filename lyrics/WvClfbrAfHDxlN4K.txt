I'ma, I'ma be there
I'ma, I'ma be there

In the dead of the night, when your body's sleepless
It's raining feelings now
Just wanna get it right, searching for meaning
In this cold angel town
I'll be the warmth in your empty hotel
I'll make it right when you're going through hell
I'll be the call when there's no one to tell
Make it light up, light up

Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'ma, I'ma be there
I'ma, I'ma be there
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'ma, I'ma be there
I'ma, I'ma be there

When life hits you hard like a train wreck
Don't you believe it'll break ya
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'ma, I'ma be there
I'ma, I'ma be there

If you lose your mind, I'll be your anchor
Holding your body down
I'll stay a while, from now until late
Two kids in this angel town
I'll be the soles of your shoes on the ground
Running with you 'til you're safe and you're sound
We'll make it out of this angel town
Make it light up, light up

Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'ma, I'ma be there
I'ma, I'ma be there
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'ma, I'ma be there
I'ma, I'ma be there

When life hits you hard like a train wreck
Don't you believe it'll break ya
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'ma, I'ma be there
I'ma, I'ma be there

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'ma, I'ma be there
I'ma, I'ma be there
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'ma, I'ma be there

When life hits you hard like a train wreck
Don't you believe it'll break ya
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'ma, I'ma be there
I'ma, I'ma be there

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh be there
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'ma, I'ma be there

Oh-oh, oh-oh be there
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh I'ma be there, I'ma be there
