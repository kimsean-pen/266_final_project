I've been hanging round for days
'Til you come back to me
Let me feel your warm embrace
I won't take it for granted
Everything is set to be
It's been going round for weeks
Cause for you I am certain
But don't you worry, worry, worry about me
Just stop me worry, worry, worrying

Where are we going
I need some closure from you
Where do we go from here
Blackbird is calling
Keep on keep yearning for you
Where do we go from here
Love

Hope you're going well out there
I'm thinking of you
Good to hear you've settled so fast
And the sun keeps shining
Well there's a cloud on top of my head
Since there's creases on your side of our bed
I am longing for you

Where are we going
I need some closure from you
Where do we go from here
Blackbird is calling
Keep on keep yearning for you
Where do we go from here

Don't you worry, worry, worry about it
Don't you worry about where we're diving from

Where are we going
I need some closure from you
Where are we going from here
Love
Where are we going
I need some closure from you
Where do we go from here
Love

I need some closure, closure, closure
The sun don't shine, when you're away
I just want to make you happy
It's been running round my head all day
But don't you worry, worry, worry
About me, about me, about me
Don't you worry, worry, worry
About me, about me, about me
I'm yearning from you
