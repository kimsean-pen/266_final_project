So I've been thinking lately
That I should try to grow up
Maybe start to show up on time

But let's be real here baby
It's not the way that we work
So why waste the sunshine?

I guess it's kinda funny
We always throw away our money
Right when we need it most

But honestly I'm happy
I don't wanna worry about
How we got to be so broke

Don't want to say goodnight let's live it up
Don't have to say we're giving up if you
Walk me home tonight I swear I could
Fly beside you or under your starlight
Don't want to say goodnight let's live it up
Don't have to wait to have it all if you
Light me up tonight I swear I could
Never burn out under your starlight

So you've been thinking lately
That you don't know what you want
But you don't know what you've got my dear

And if it's dreams we're chasing
You've got the world at your feet
The skyline is so clear

We're getting hung up on the things we should have known
Never bothered us before
We're try'na make ends meet but I'm starting to think
That this is all I need and more

Don't want to say goodnight let's live it up
Don't have to say we're giving up if you
Walk me home tonight I swear I could
Fly beside you or under your starlight
Don't want to say goodnight let's live it up
Don't have to wait to have it all if you
Light me up tonight I swear I could
Never burn out under your starlight

Well our jeans are well ripped with our pockets thin
We don't have any change so we'll just put our hands in
You'll keep me warm tonight
I don't need nice things to help me sleep at night
Well it's never felt better to have nothing but you
And no one understands me but I'm telling the truth
Coz we can live in our own world as long as you love me
As long as you love me

Don't want to say goodnight let's live it up
Don't have to say we're giving up if you
Walk me home tonight I swear I could
Fly beside you or under your starlight
Don't want to say goodnight let's live it up
Don't have to wait to have it all if you
Light me up tonight I swear I could
Never burn out under your starlight
Don't want to say goodnight let's live it up
I'm lost tonight under your starlight
