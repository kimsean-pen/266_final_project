I've got a secret
And if you can keep it
Come on and breathe me
If you want to go
Away from the city
Where everyone's busy
Come on and breathe me
If you want to know

Make it my fantasy
It's only you and me
I've got a secret
And if you can keep it
Come on and play me
If you want to know

Play my fantasy
It's only you and me
Losing reality
You're the oxygen I need

Can't breathe
You're the oxygen I need
Can't breathe
You're the oxygen
The oxygen I need

You're touching my body
I want your body
Don't need no talking
Want you all alone
Losing control
Baby, its 'so soft
Ready to go now
Want you all alone

Play in my fantasy
It's only you and me
Losing reality
You're the oxygen I need

Can't breathe
You're the oxygen I need
Can't breathe
You're the oxygen
The oxygen I need

You're the oxygen I need
Can't breathe
You're the oxygen
The oxygen I need
