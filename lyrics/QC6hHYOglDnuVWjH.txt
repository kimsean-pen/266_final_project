The man is an offender
He took my value
And I give back his shame
And I take back my power
My body is my own
My body is mine alone
And I deserve protection
And I can create it for you
Is this what my body said?
"Use me
Drain me
Fall around me"
Is this what my body said?
"Engulf me
I'm already dead"
I have a feel of things
Cry and shakes the wall for you
And I am moving to poison love
And drown the stars above you
My body is my own
My body is mine alone
And I deserve protection
And I can create it for you
Is this what my body said?
"Use me
Drain me
Fall around me"
Is this what my body said?
"Engulf me
I'm already dead"
Keep cutting myself on the edges of reality
(x2)
Is this what my body said? Keep cutting myself on the edges of
"Use me Reality
Drain me
Fall around me"
Is this what my body said? Keep cutting myself on the edges of
"Engulf me Reality
I'm already dead"
