It was the coldest night of the year
Snow-covered street lamps and belvedere
The moon was just a sliver
Light was fading
The war was on its way
And we were waiting
You asked me, how long I'd stay by your side
And so I answered
With only just one reply

Til the casket drops
Til my dying day
Til my heartbeat stops
Til my legs just break
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Til the casket drops

A house made out of glass, will surely shatter
So we built a fortress, of red bricks and ladders
The ground, has started shaking
The bombs are falling
But we could've walked away
We had a warning

And you asked me, how long I'd stay by your side
And so I answered
With only just one reply
Til the casket drops

Til my dying day
Til my heartbeat stops
Til my legs just break
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Til the casket drops

So lay your burden down baby
And leave me out the door
We can't escape this rickashay
I'm ready for this war

So lay your burden down baby
And leave me out the door
We can't escape this rickashay
I'm ready for this war

Til the casket drops
Til my dying day
Til my heartbeat stops
Til my legs just break

Til the casket drops
Til my dying day
Til my heartbeat stops
Til my legs just break

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Til the casket drops
