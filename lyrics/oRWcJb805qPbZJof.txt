Never wanted, never needed
you said honey, best be leaving
if you want, I'll pack a bag
foreign money
in your hand
in your hand baby

Tube of tooth paste, facial cleanser
bar of soap, and moisturizer

But it gets better
but it gets better

Never wanted, never needed
you said honey, how you feeling?
hotel pillows, worth a try
if you want me,
swing on by
swing on by baby

Mini bar, with many choices
bedside table, distant voices

But its gets better
does it get better
does it get better
does it get better
does it get better

Never wanted, never needed
you said honey, best be leaving
if you want, I'll pack a bag
foreign money
in your hand
in your hand baby
