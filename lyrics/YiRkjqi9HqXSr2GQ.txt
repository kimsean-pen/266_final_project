Aimlessly traveling
Compelled by nothing wandering star
Nomadic habitation
Rests down wind of devastation
Stretched and unraveling
Dispelled by nothing into the dark
The absence of creation
Death consuming gravitation

Compression, no retention
Pieces fleet to new dimensions
This cosmic monument undone ...
Sinking into the black
And empty, sucked into the depths
Disintegrate to the unknown

Brightening the surroundings
Releasing energy
Violence and light resounding
An astral elegy

Stars torn asunder exploding into dust
And vicious winds, equivalent
To the power of a thousand suns
A roaming thunder, a newborn nebula
Diminish and begin again
Stellar tidal disruption

The void dismantling
Expelling specks of wandering stars
Disruptive malformation
On the cusp of mass mutation
A gaseous channeling
Repelling light from near to afar
Engulfing ruination
Sudden solar decimation

Compression, no retention
Pieces fleet to new dimensions
This cosmic monument undone
Sinking into the black...
Disintegrate to the unknown

Brightening the surroundings
Releasing energy
Resounding astral elegy

Stars torn asunder exploding into dust
And vicious winds, equivalent
To the power of a thousand suns
A roaming thunder, a newborn nebula
Diminish and begin again
Stellar tidal disruption

Moved into the deepest unknown...
Warping through
Removed pools of matter, splatter the universe.

Stars torn asunder exploding into dust
And vicious winds, equivalent
To the power of a thousand suns.
A roaming thunder, a newborn nebula...
Diminish and begin again
Stellar tidal disruption.

Disruption
