Are you ready boy?
Here I come, catch me I'm falling

You came into my life
The look in your eyes
Took me by surprise
It's you
And nobody else
Your love hase made me
So blind I can't see

I am descending
From heaven above
So catch me I'm fallin baby
Hold onto my love

(Chorus)
Catch me I'm falling
Catch me now I'm falling
Catch me I'm falling
Catch me now I'm falling
Falling in love

Two hearts beating in time
The rhythm as one
I am yours, you are mine
For you
I surrender myself
Each night-every day
Always feeling this way

Falling in motion
As though I had wings
Your sweet love and devotion
Baby it's magic
A magical thing

Chorus

(Tag)
Ooooh baby, what can I do?
I'm falling for you
