Got lots of bars
Around this town
They got cold beer
Yeah, and they got crown
Got neon lights
In the windowpane
Got lots of guys

Thinkin' they got game
Got loud guitars
A little out of tune
But they ain't got a girl like you
Nah, they don't
They play lots of songs

On the radio
About them good ole' country girls that we all know
Long tan legs
And cutoff jeans
Yeah, just shakin' that sugar every country boy's dream

I've heard 'em all
At least a time or two
Ain't none 'bout a girl like you
You know that's true
You've got that beautiful
Born with it kind of thing

It comes so natural
No baby don't ever change
And I wonder when
I see the smile on your face
Baby, what did I do?

To ever get a girl like you

A girl like you
You can dress it on up

Or you can just hang out
Kick it on Broadway
Or kick back on the couch
You can dance on the bar
You can dance in the rain

Shotgun a beer
Or just sip champagne
Yeah, there's only one
Ain't room for two
There ain't another girl like you
Another girl like you
You've got that beautiful
Born with a kind of thing
It comes so natural
No baby don't ever change
And I wonder when
I see the smile on your face
Baby, what did I do?
To ever get a girl like you
A girl like you
Baby, what did I do?
To get a girl like you
A girl like you don't come along
But once in a lifetime
Better hang on
I can't find one thing wrong
I could just go on and on and on
You've got that beautiful
Born with it kind of thing
It comes so natural
No baby don't ever change
And I wonder when
I see the smile on your face
Baby, what did I do
To ever get a girl like you
A girl like you
Baby what did I do?
To get a girl like you
I could sail the ocean blue
And never find, never find a girl like you
