Back when I had a little
I thought that I needed a lot
A little was overrated
But a lot was a little too complicated

You see, zero didn't satisfy me
A million didn't make me happy
That's when I learned a lesson
That it's all about your perceptions

Hey, are you a papa or a superstar?
So you act, so you feel, so you are
It ain't about the size of your car
It's about the size of the faith in your heart

It doesn't cost a thing to smile
You don't have to pay to laugh
You better thank God for that

It doesn't cost a thing to smile
You don't have to pay to laugh
You better thank God for that

Off in the back country of Brazil
A met a young brother that made me feel
That I could accomplish anything
You see just like me he wanted to sing

He had no windows and no doors
He lived a simple life and was extremely poor
On top of all of that he had no eyesight
But that didn't keep him from seein' the light

He said, what's it like in the USA?
And all I did was complain
He said, "Livin' here is paradise"
He taught me paradise is in your mind

You know that there's hope
It doesn't cost a thing to smile
You don't have to pay to laugh
You better thank God for that

It doesn't cost a thing to smile
You don't have to pay to laugh
You better thank God for that

(There's hope)
Every time I turn on the TV
(There's hope)
Somebody's actin' crazy
(There's hope)
If you let it, it'll drive you crazy
(There's hope)
But I'm takin' back my power today

(There's hope)
Gas prices, they just keep on risin'
(There's hope)
The government they keep on lyin'
But we gotta keep on survivin'
Keep livin' our truth and do the best we can do

'Cause there's hope
It doesn't cost a thing to smile
You don't have to pay to laugh
You better thank God for that, yeah yeah

It doesn't cost a thing to smile
You don't have to pay to laugh
You better thank God for that, yeah yeah yeah

Stand up for your rights
Keep shinin' your light
And show the world your smile

Stand up for your rights
Keep shinin' your light
And show the world your smile

It doesn't cost a thing to smile
You don't have to pay to laugh
You better thank God for that
You better thank God for that

It doesn't cost a thing to smile
You don't have to pay to laugh
You better thank God for that, yeah yeah
