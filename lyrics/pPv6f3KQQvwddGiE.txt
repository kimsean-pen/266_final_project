Where was your mouth when they told you to talk?
Where was your travellin' toe when they told you to walk?
Where was your heart when they told you to love?
Where was your big big brain?
Guess it wasn't working hard enough

Now in the middle of the sun
I'm thinking about the universe
I think I know how it works
But I'm a bit less than positive

It's a crack you assume
That I know anything about you
If I knew anything about you
I'm less than positive

Where was your watch when you needed to watch?
Where was the tic and toc when you asked it to stop?
Where was your mouth when you needed a smile?
Only got stretches out
And down for such a long time now

In the middle of the sun
I'm thinking about the universe
I think I know how it works
But I'm a bit less than positive

It's a crack you assume
That I know anything about you
If I knew anything about you
I'm less than positive

In the middle of the sun
I'm thinking about the universe
I think I know how it works
But I'm a bit less than positive

It's a crack you assume
That I know anything about you
If I knew anything about you
I'm less than positive

But if we don't need nobody to cry upon
But if we don't need nobody to cry upon
But if we don't need nobody
Cry upon
But if we don't need nobody to cry upon
