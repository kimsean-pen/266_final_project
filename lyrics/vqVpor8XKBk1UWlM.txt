Love
Your love
Ain't got nothin' on me
It's just a fantasy
Ain't got nothin' on me

Your love
Ain't got nothin' on me
It's just a fantasy
Ain't got nothin' on me
Like all of the orphans
I got none of the friends
I was alone 'til

You came and went

Now there's someone inside me
I think it's you
Won't let you go, babe
Until I am through
With your love
Ain't got nothin' on me
It's just a fantasy

Ain't got nothin' on me
Your love

Ain't got nothin' on me
It's just a fantasy
Ain't got nothin' on me
Love
All of these voices

Debate in my head
One thinks I'm crazy
And one thinks I'm dead

I am alive when I battle with you
You think you amaze me
I think that it's true
That your love

Ain't got nothin' on me
It's just a fantasy
Ain't got nothin' on me
Your love

Ain't got nothin' on me
It's just a fantasy
Ain't got nothin' on me
When you come around
I lose my mind from the sound

Of your voice and your laughter
I'll come right after
Your love
That your love
Ain't got nothin' on me
It's just a fantasy
Ain't got nothin' on me
Your love
Ain't got nothin' on me
It's just a fantasy
Ain't got nothin' on me
Ain't got nothin' on me
Got nothin' on me
Ain't got nothin' on me
Love got nothin' on me
Ain't got nothin' on me
Got nothin' on me
Love got nothin' on me
Love got nothin' on me
