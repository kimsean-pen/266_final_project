If my heart had a heart
It would show me some mercy
Wouldn't be so cold and cruel
No, it wouldn't keep hurting me
It wouldn't make it this hard
It wouldn't do me this way
It would cut me some slack, have my back
It would give me a break

If my heart had a heart it would go on and leave me alone
It'd stop having a mind of it's own
Let me forget you and let me let go
It would stop hanging on
It would finally put this to rest
Instead of putting this stake in my chest
Oh no, it wouldn't tear me apart

If my heart had a heart
It wouldn't still sing
Every time that I see you, someone says your name
I wouldn't still want you
No, I'd be okay

If my heart had a heart it would go on and leave me alone
It'd stop having a mind of it's own
Let me forget you and let me let go
It would stop hanging on
It would finally put this to rest
Instead of putting this stake in my chest
Oh no, it wouldn't tear me apart

If my heart had a heart, oh

If my heart had a heart
It'd stop breaking in two
It would stop loving you

If my heart had a heart it would go on and leave me alone
It'd stop having a mind of it's own
Let me forget you and let me let go
It would stop hanging on
It would finally put this to rest
Instead of putting this stake in my chest
Oh no, it wouldn't tear me apart

If my heart had a heart, oh
If my heart had a heart
