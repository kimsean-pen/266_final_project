Absentee
Completes me
Our vapid clouds depleted I'm a stranger In my life.
Oh lord, Send me back in time
Back in time
To before we met, I would confide in myself Say that
"Once you give her everything, She'll turn and she'll die on you..."
But time won't let me go
Never gonna make it on your own
I'm never gonna make it cos I cannot
I wanna secondguess, but I take the fall
Never gonna make it on your own
I'm never gonna make it cos I cannot But I've never
had feels like this before
Oh lord, Send me back in time
Back in time
To before we met,
I would confide in myself Say that "
Once you give her everything, She'll turn and she'll die on you..."
But time won't let me go

Now I'm a stranger In my mind.
Oh lord, Send me back in time
Back in time
To before we met, I would confide in myself Say that "

But time won't let me go
Never gonna make it on your own
I'm never gonna make it cos I cannot I wanna
secondguess, but I take the fall Never gonna make it on your own
I'm never gonna make it cos I cannot But I've never
had feels like this before Oh lord, Send me back in time
