I could lose my heart tonight
If you don't turn and walk away
Cause the way I feel I might
Lose control and let you stay
Cause I could take you in my arms
And never let go

I could fall in love with you
I could fall in love with you

I can only wonder how
Touching you would make me feel
But if I take that chance right now
Tomorrow will you want me still
So I should keep this to myself
And never let you know

I could fall in love with you
I could fall in love with you
And I know it's not right
And I guess I should try
To do what I should do
But I could fall in love
fall in love with you
I could fall in love with you

Siempre estoy so√±ando en ti
besando mis labios
acariciando mi piel
abrazandome con ansias
imaginando que me amas
como yo podria amarte.
So I should keep this to myself

And never let you know
i could fall in love with you
i could fall in love with you
I could fall in love
I could fall in love with you
I could fall, fall in love with you
i could fall in love with you
