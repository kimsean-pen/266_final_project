She's got eyes like Zapruder
Mouth like heroin
She wants me to be
Perfect like Kennedy
This isn't God, this isn't God
This isn't God, this isn't God
God is just a statistic
God is just a statistic
Say show me the dead stars
All them sing, yaa
(Hey)
This is a riot

Religious and clean

(Hey)

(Hey)
God is a number you cannot count to

You are post-human and hardwired
She's pilgrim and pagan

Soft worn and social
In all of her dreams
She's a saint like Jackie O
This isn't God, this isn't God
This isn't God, this isn't God

God is just a statistic
God is just a statistic
Say show me the dead stars

All them sing, yaa
(Hey)
This is a riot
Religious and clean
(Hey)
Show me the dead stars
All them sing, yaa
(Hey)
This is a riot
Religious and clean
God is a number you cannot count to
God is a number you cannot count to
God is a number you cannot count to
You are post-human and hardwired
{All that glitters is cold
All that glitters is cold
All that glitters is cold}
Say show me the dead stars
All them sing, yaa
(Hey, yea, hey, yea, hey, yea)
This is a riot
Religious and clean
(Hey, yea, hey, yea, hey, yea)
Say show me the dead stars
All them sing, yaa
(Hey, hey, hey)
This is a riot
Religious and clean
(Hey, hey, hey)
Ladies and gentleman
