In a lifetime
There's a moment
To awaken

To the sound of
Your heartbeat
Unbroken

And you're free now
And I will remain
Still dreaming

Alive and aware
The love that I once believed in

And one day you'll feel me
A whisper upon the breeze
And I'll watch you stand there
Unafraid

And I'll speak to you silently
And know that you'll hear me
The feeling is more than I've ever known

And one day you'll feel me
In a whisper upon the breeze
And I'll watch you stand there
Unafraid

And I'll speak to you silently
And know that you'll hear me

Come back to me
Please believe

The feeling is more than I've ever known

I can't believe it was just an illusion
