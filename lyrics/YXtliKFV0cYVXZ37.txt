I've got to love somebody today
I've got to love somebody
I've got to love somebody today
I've got to love somebody

Tired of movies all by myself
I'm sure you folks know what I mean
My time has come and I need someone
To share my popcorn and jellybeans

Looked in the mirror, it all got clearer
I won't let my life pass me by
Stop feelin' sorry for myself
Fish are bitin', I'll throw out my line

I've got to love somebody today
I've got to love somebody (Hey)

Must be careful and watch my step
I hope the shock is very mild
I'll change my hair and change my style
Watch out, I might just go wild

I got to get out and live
And show the world how much I can give
I'm gonna do it all by myself
I'll make a love you can put on a shelf
