She breaks her horses
With strange distant voices
That travel through the air
They travel through the air

She tames with her voices
As she plays around with the forces
That travel through the air
They travel through the air

Ooh the distant howling out
Keeps you floating around
Ohh distant howling out
Forces floating around

She breaks her horses
With strange distant voices
That travel through the air
They travel through the air
