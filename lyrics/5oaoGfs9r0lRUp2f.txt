Zwei, drei, vier, one, two, three
It's easy to see
But it's not that I don't care so
'Cause I hear it all the time
But they never let you know
On the TV and the radio, cha
She was young her heart was pure
But every night its price she got
She said sugar sweet
You got me rappin' to the beat
Then I knew that she was hot
She was singin'

Don't turn around, uh ah oh
Schau, schau
Der Kommissar's in town, uh ah oh
You're in his eye
And you'll know why
The more you live
The faster you will die
Alles klar, Herr Kommissar?

She said babe you know
I miss Jill and Joe
And all my funky friends
But my street understanding
Was just enough to know what she really meant
And I got to thinking while she was talking
That her nose, it told the story
Of those special places that she goes
When she rides with the others in the subway
Singin'

Don't turn around, uh ah oh
Schau, schau
Der Kommissar's in town, uh ah oh
And if he talks to you
And you don't know why
You say your life
Is gonna make you die
Alles klar, Herr Kommissar?

Schau, schau, schau, schau, schau, schau
Schau, schau, schau, schau, schau, schau

Well, we meet Jill and Joe
And brother Hipp
And the whole cool gang and all
They're rappin' here they're rappin' there
But she's climbin' on the wall
It's a clear case, Herr Kommissar
'Cause all the children know
They're all slidin' down into the valley
They're all slipping on the same snow
Hear the children

Don't turn around, uh ah oh
Schau, schau
Der Kommissar's in town, uh ah oh
He's got the power
And you're so weak
And your frustration will not let you speak
La, la, la, la, la, la
Don't turn around, uh ah oh
Schau, schau
Der Kommissar's in town, uh ah oh
And if he talks to you
Then you'll know why
The more you live
The faster you will die

Don't turn around, uh ah oh
Schau, schau
The Kommissar's in town, uh ah oh
Ooh, don't turn around, uh ah oh
Schau, schau
The Kommissar's in town, uh ah oh
Alles klar, Herr Kommissar?
Don't turn around, uh ah oh
Schau, schau
The Kommissar's in town, uh ah oh
Ooh, don't turn around, uh ah oh
Schau, schau
The Kommissar's in town, uh ah oh
Don't turn around, uh ah oh
Schau, schau
The Kommissar's in town, uh ah oh
Don't turn around, uh ah oh
Schau, schau
The Kommissar's in town, uh ah oh
