Now this is the story all about how
My life got flipped, turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air

In West Philadelfia, born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool

And all shooting some Bb-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys said, we're up in no good
Started making trouble in my neighbourhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared

And said, "You're moving with your aunty and uncle in Bel Air"
I begged and pleaded with her the other day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket

I put my walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it"
First class, yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel Air are livin' like

Hmm, this might be alright!
Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?

I don't think so, I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel Air
Well I, the plane landed and when I came out

There was dude look like a cop standing waving my name out
I ain't trying to get arrest of you, I just got here
Spring with the quickness like dissappear
I whistled for a cab and when it came near the
License plate said fresh and had a dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought now forget it, yo home to Bel Air
I pulled up to a house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabby yo, home smell you later
Looked at my kingdom I was finally there
To settle my throne as the prince of Bel Air
