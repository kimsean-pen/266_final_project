I wanna be rich
And I want lots of money
I don't care about clever
I don't care about funny
I want loads of clothes
And fuck loads of diamonds
I heard people die while they're trying to find them

And I'll take my clothes off
And it will be shameless
'Cause everyone knows that's how you get famous
I'll look at The Sun
And I'll look in The Mirror
I'm on the right track
Yeah I'm onto a winner

I don't know what's right and what's real anymore
And I don't know how I'm meant to feel anymore
And when do you think it will all become clear?
'Cause I'm being taken over by the fear

Life's about film stars
And less about mothers
It's all about fast cars
And cussing each other
But it doesn't matter
'Cause I'm packing plastic
And that's what makes my life so fucking fantastic
And I am a weapon of massive consumption
And it's not my fault
It's how I'm programmed to function
I'll look at the Sun
And I'll look in The Mirror
I'm on the right track
Yeah we're onto a winner

I don't know what's right and what's real anymore
And I don't know how I'm meant to feel anymore
And when do you think it will all become clear?
'Cause I'm being taken over by the fear

Forget about guns and forget ammunition
'Cause I'm killing them all on my own little mission
Now I'm not a saint
But I'm not a sinner
And everything's cool as long as I'm getting thinner

I don't know what's right and what's real anymore
And I don't know how I'm meant to feel anymore
And when do you think it will all become clear?
'Cause I'm being taken over by the fear
