Let's just forget
Everything said
Everything we did
Best friends and better halves

Goodbyes
And the other night when we realized
We were falling out of love
Don't say never did
The last thing thing we want to be

It's overly dramatic
I just think it's best
Cause you can't miss what you forget
So lets just pretend

Everything and
Anything between you and me
Was never meant
Was never meant
