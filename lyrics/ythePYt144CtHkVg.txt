You chill everything that you see
You chill the nerves that live in me
With your eyes, they never lie

Deep as the ocean, cold like the sea
I'm lost in your storm
You poured it out on me
With your eyes, they never lie

Cold
She's never coming back
To me
She's never coming back,
To me

I see her in my hands
I know she's in my soul
But she left me here trailing
in the coldest of the snow

oh her smile, oh her smile
Deep as the ocean, cold like the sea
I'm lost in your storm
You poured it out on me
With your eyes... they never lie

Cold
She's never coming back
To me
She's never coming back to me
To me

Oh, she's never coming back to me
Oh, she's never coming back to me
Oh, she's never coming back to me
