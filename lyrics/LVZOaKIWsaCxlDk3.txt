The police walked in for Jimmy Jazz
I said, "He ain't here, but he sure went past"
Oh, you're looking for
Jimmy Jazz and they said

Sattamassagana for Jimmy dread
Cut off his ears and chop off his head
Police come looking for
Jimmy Jazz, Jazz, Jazz, Jazz

So if you're gonna take a message 'cross the town
Maybe put it down somewhere over the other side
See it gets to
Jimmy Jazz, Jazz, see

So tell it all, police come in they said
"Now, where's Jimmy Jazz?"
I said, "Hmm, he was here but, uh, he said, he went out"
Who is it they're lookin' for?
Jimmy Jazz, Jazz, Jazz, Jazz eh

Sattamassagana for Jimmy dread
Cut off his ears and they'll chop off his head
Oh you're lookin' for
Jimmy Jazz, Jazz, Jazz

What a relief!
I feel like a soldier
But I look like a thief
It's for the Jazz

Police come lookin' for the Jimmy Jazz
He came in and he may go
'Cos now they"ll get him hanged for that
Jimmy Jazz, Jimmy Jazz

Infact, don't you bother me, not anymore
I can't take this tale, oh, no more
It's all around
Jimmy Jazz, Jazz

J A Z Z, J A Zed Zed Z Z Z
J A Zed Zed, J A Zed Zed, J A Zed, Jimmy Jazz
And then it sucks
He said, suck that

So go look all around, you can try your luck, brother
And see what you found
But I guarantee you that it ain't your day
Your day, it ain't your day
Chop! chop
