Born under red skies
dungeons and darkness
Six bards - one of a kind
Wohoe! We dance on the witch's night
Music and spirit
for the outcast brotherooh
brotherhood
Six bards - one for all!
wohoe! the elven family
Fire! Round the flames we dance to our reels
pronouncing our rites (legions!)
Scream out words of heathenry and magic

We are the monsters, the tragedy poets
Wanderers and we fight back!
We're as one with the sky
We are the pagan legions sons of Mother Earth
Back to pagan roots we light
The fires of purity, minority, we are
The elven legions on the rise

Legions on the rise

Heathenreel and witchcraft
poems and legends
Six torches burn in the night
We are (we are) casting a spell on you!
From blood we come and as stone we cease
the tree of our eternal night
We are (we are) the elven dynasty
Fire, we'll be cast in the mountain of fire

Dead fallen hero's legion
Like a modern Prometheus we rise from the ashes

We are the monsters, the tragedy poets
Wanderers and we fight back
We're as one with the sky
We are the pagan legions sons of Mother Earth

Back to pagan roots we light
The fires of purity, minority we are
The elven legions on the rise

We are the offkeys
We gather in secrecy
Dormant apparently ready to mind
We're as one with the earth
We are the pagan legions

Sons of Mother Earth
We've embraced the ways of purity
Summoned the one and mastered the runes
We are ready to strike

We are the monsters, the tragedy poets
Wanderers and we fight back
We're as one with the sky
We are the pagan legions sons of Mother Earth
Back to pagan roots we light
The fires of purity, minority we are
The elven legions on the rise
Legions on the rise
