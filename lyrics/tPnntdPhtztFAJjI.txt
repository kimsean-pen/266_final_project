In my head, when I'm home
I'm in the part of my life, alive on the ropes
Higher ground, been so low
I will survive in the wild, alive on my own

Oh, mister, I won't change my way
No, I don't hear a word you say
Hey, hey
If you think I'm good as gone
No, no, you're dead wrong
You're dead wrong
I move on

Oh, when your heart starts beating
Oh, can you feel it, feel it?
Oh, when your soul ain't breathing
You get right back
You get right back
Oh, when your heart starts beating
Oh, can you feel it, feel it?
Oh, when you stop believing
You get right back
You get right back

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

What you need?
What you want?
It's time to open your eyes and find what you lost
Take a stand when you fall
Don't let them pigeon your mind, you'll never get caught

Oh, mister, I won't change my way
No, I don't hear a word you say
Hey, hey
If you think I'm good as gone
No, no, you're dead wrong
You're dead wrong
I move on

Oh, when your heart starts beating
Oh, can you feel it, feel it?
Oh, when your soul ain't breathing
You get right back
You get right back
Oh, when your heart starts beating
Oh, can you feel it, feel it?
Oh, when you stop believing
You get right back
You get right back

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

What you came for
In the danger
With a stranger lose control
Do it all night
On the front line
Till the sun rise, don't let go

I won't change my way
No I don't hear a word you say
Hey, hey
If you think I'm good as gone
No no you're dead wrong
You're dead wrong
I move on

Oh, when your heart starts beating
Oh, can you feel it, feel it?
Oh, when your soul ain't breathing
You get right back
You get right back
Oh, when your heart starts beating
Oh, can you feel it, feel it?
Oh, when you stop believing
You get right back
You get right back

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
