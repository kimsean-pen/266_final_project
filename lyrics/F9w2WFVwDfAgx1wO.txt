Now don't you make me
make me go crazy!
I'll be your lover
you want no other
you wanna take me?
I know you want to
you wanna break me?
Are you ready to go?
There's a monster deep inside of me
I'll rip you to pieces, don't try to save me
Nothing can turn me down
Don't you mistake me
to such a sweet thing
That just a warning
the damage I can bring
Are you going to take me away?
I'm a monster locked in a cage
There's a monster deep inside of me
I'll rip you to pieces, don't try to save me
Nothing can turn me down
Bring out the monster
It breaths inside of me
There's nothing to run to
Don't try to break me
nothing can hold me down
I've been locked up in a cage
and I will scape
There's a monster...
There's a monster...
There's a monster deep inside of me
I'll rip you to pieces, don't try to save me
Nothing can turn me down
Bring out the monster
It breaths inside of me
There's nothing to run to
Don't try to break me
nothing can hold me down
