He's a real Nowhere Man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to

Isn't he a bit like you and me?

Nowhere Man, Please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man
The world is at your command
He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere Man, Can you see me at all?
Nowhere Man, Don't worry
Take your time, Don't hurry
Leave it all
Till somebody else lends you a hand
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, Please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man
The world is at your command
He's a real Nowhere Man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
