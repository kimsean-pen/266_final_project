Sweep me away
I know I bring out the bad in your eyes

Melted in
Numb from what's in my head
My eyes are open
But I don't see anything
The lonely lovers
Will find themselves again
Fathers and brothers
Won't let their family sleep

I'm at my best in silence
What's the word for that?
So throw it back in my face

Sweep me away
I know I bring out the bad in your eyes

I see I'm lighting a fire
Inside your mind
But don't self destruct like me
No, it's not safe to be like me
I'll never make the choice
So pull the plug on me
It's not safe to be like me
No, it's not safe to be like me

Sweep me away
I know I bring out the bad in your eyes

So wake me up when it's over
I can't bear to stay awake
