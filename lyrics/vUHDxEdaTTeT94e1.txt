Lately of I've been thinking how much I miss my lady
Amoreena's in the cornfield brightening in the daybreak
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay, oh like a puppy child

And when it rains the rain falls down washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing fit to burst upon each other

I can see you sitting eating apples in the evening
The fruit juice flowing slowly, slowly, slowly down the bronze of your body
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay, oh like a puppy child

And when it rains the rain falls down washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing fit to burst upon each other, oh

Oh, if only I could nestle in the cradle of your cabin
My arms around your shoulders, oh the windows wide and open
While the swallow and the sycamore are playing in the valley
Oh I miss you Amoreena like a king bee misses honey

And when it rains the rain falls down washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing fit to burst upon each other

And when it rains the rain falls down washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing fit to burst upon each other, oh

Lately I've been thinking how much I miss my lady
Amoreena's in the cornfield brightening in the daybreak
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay, oh like a puppy, like a puppy child, oh
