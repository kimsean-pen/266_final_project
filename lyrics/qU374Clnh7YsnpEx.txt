Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Dancing with the lights on
Shadows in my reflection
Draw curtains in
Dust gathering
Clutching at things
But now just dreams

Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Dancing with the lights on
Shadows in my reflection
Dullest skies cover windows
Polished smile slowly turns cold
Dancing with the lights on
Shadows in my reflection
