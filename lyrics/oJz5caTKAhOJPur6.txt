Bright night flowers ask the dust
Make them ours and blame the rust
Stealing every vacant candle when the city's eyes are so deep
Falling in and out of love just to sing the twilight to sleep

When the false alarm and eyes collide
Walk with liars by their side
A thousand Juliets are driving every boy out of his mind
Crying in the rain wishing she was still the first of her kind

And how do they ever forget they got it wrong
Why do they never regret they took so long
And I wish I'd never tried to be on their side

Bright night flowers paint them blue
Sweep the dust for me and you
Stealing every vacant candle when the city's eyes are so deep
Falling in and out of love just to sing the twilight to sleep

When the false alarms and eyes collide
Walk with liars by their side
A thousand Juliets are driving every boy out of his mind
Crying in the rain wishing she was still the first of her kind

And how do they ever forget they got it wrong
Why do they never regret they took so long
I wish I never tried to be on their side

And how do they ever forget they got it wrong
Why do they never regret they took so long
I wish I never tried to be on their side
