On the other side of night and day
I could be no farther away
The moon I see is not our moon,
This sun is not the one we know
But the are safe with you at home
It's I, who's gone

And I am pining for you,
Reminded of you all the time
I'm always pining, for you

What I thought was so unique about you
Must be common after all
For I am constantly reminded of you everywhere I go
What I thought was so extraordinary, is common after all
As I am constantly pining for you, everywhere I go

You could go anywhere and people would invite you to stay
I could meet anyone else and still feel completely alone
So I try to distract myself and make new discoveries
But as I explore the forests of my Seoul, I see you in the trees

And I am pining for you,
Reminded of you all the time
I'm always pining, for you

What I thought was so unique about you
Must be common after all
For I am constantly reminded of you everywhere I go
What I thought was so extraordinary is common around the world
Men are always pining for their loves, while their loves don't pine for them at all

And I am pining for you, reminded of you in everything I see
I'm always pining, for you
And I am pining for you, reminded of you in everything I see
I'm always pining for you, though I know you don't pine for me

In the land of the rising sun, I dream of the midnight run
In the land of the morning calm, I lie awake until tomorrow's dawn

On the other side of night and day
I could be no farther away
The moon I see is not our moon, This sun is not the one we know
