You're never gonna change your mind
Yeah, and never take some time with
Your-hoo-hoo-hoo
It's not within us to stay in the dark
But it doesn't matter who-oo-oo-oo
Carrying out your thoughts in the vacant
Where you talk is not your thing
Maybe it's not because your fame has
Faded into dust and turned to gray
You tell me you are not in love
That your day is taken up with other things
You say you won't admit that your favorite place to live is on your own
and you probably won't but you probably do
Oo-oo every spark is in your hair
You can make it hard to understand
You-ooo you kept it written on your hand
But you hardly gave it a chance
You started out with your fate decided
You could meet a party steps away
You look around with your space divided
It's not the promise that you made
What you want me to do?
Would you want me at all?
What you want me to do?
What you want me to do?
Would you want me at all?
What you want me to do?
What you want me to do?
Would you want me at all?
What you want me to do?
What you want me to do?
What you want me to do?
Would you want me at all?
What you want me to do?
What you want me to do?
What you want me to do?
Would you want me at all?
What you want me to do?
