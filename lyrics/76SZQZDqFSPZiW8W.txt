Am I obsessing over thinking too much?
'Cause I'm finding it hard to breathe
You think I'm a feral, I'm a wild thing
And it could be the end of me

So overpressure, I'm applying too much
'Cause I'm sweeping you off your feet
You give me the finger like a foul thing
I'm as mad as I'm allowed to be

Did you think this was ever the deal?
No, I can't tell if you're being real
I am sick, so fed up, I am done
Yeah, I suffered enough

I'm nothing but lovesick
'Cause nothing makes sense when I'm not with you
I'm nothing but honest
I wanna give up, giving up on you
I'm nothing but lovesick

You're a confession, you're a lot like a crush
But the problem is not discreet
Say you got a medical condition
Either that, or you can't take the heat

So what's the question, am I not a lost cause?
'Cause I'm walking a one way street
I can touch the ceiling with my fingers
But I am stuck under your feet

Did you think this was ever the deal?
No, I can't tell if you're being real
I am sick, so fed up, I am done
Yeah, I suffered enough

I'm nothing but lovesick
'Cause nothing makes sense when I'm not with you
I'm nothing but honest
I wanna give up, giving up on you
I'm nothing but lovesick
I'm nothing but love-lovesick

I'm opening your eyes
So go with it, go with it, go with it now
Like you have opened mine
So go with it, go with it, go with it now

I'm nothing but love-lovesick
'Cause nothing makes sense when I'm not with you
I'm nothing but honest
I wanna give up, giving up on you
I'm nothing but love-lovesick
I'm nothing but love-lovesick
