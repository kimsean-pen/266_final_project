It's a miracle what you put me through
Said you wanna make love but I won't do
You never reached out once when we lost the war
I'll be honest I've never seen that before

But I'll forgive the past
I'll forgive lost time
And I've finally stopped asking how to make you mine

But it's not enough
Cuz I can't give up
Til I forgive myself for loving you, ooh-ooh

Now the room creaks like there's someone here
and I can't make that sound disappear
I stay up thinking all night long
But it's better than sleeping with the lights on

Well I forgive your love
and I forgive your heart
and I realize it wasn't everything I thought
But it's not enough
Cuz I can't give up
Til I forgive myself for loving you, ooh-ooh

Take it out
of my skin
Like a splinter
This love This stuff
Keeps saying
My heaaaaa-heaaaaarrrrt

And now I wonder do you think of me
Or did you already find the girl you need
Did you hear I moved out to the stars
Cuz I don't even know where you are

Oh I know you're gone
And I've been so strong
I've been walking, talking, crawling like the feelings done
But it's not enough
Cuz I can't give up
Til I forgive myself for loving you, ooh-ooh
