Oh! (what the fuck?)
(What the fuck? whoa, man)
You burden me with your questions

You'd have me tell no lies
You're always asking what it's all about
Don't listen to my replies
You say to me I don't talk enough
But when I do I'm a fool
These times I've spent, I've realized
To shoot through and leave you

The things you say
Your purple prose just gives you away
The things you say
You're unbelievable
Oh! (what the fuck?)
(What the fuck? whoa, man)

You burden me with your problems
By telling me more about mine
I'm always so concerned
With the way you say
You've always go to stop
To think of us being one
Is more than I ever know
But this time, I realize
I'm going to shoot through and leave you

The things you say
Your purple prose just gives you away
The things you say
You're unbelievable
Oh! (what the fuck?)
(Good point, what the fuck?)
(...point, what the fuck?)
(...point, what the fuck? whoa, man)

Seemingly last less
Don't mean you can ask us
Pushing down the relative
Bringing out your higher self
Think of the fine times
Pushing down the better few
Instead of bringing out the clues
To what the world and everything you ask to
Brace yourself with the grace of ease
I know this world ain't what it seems
(What the fuck? whoa, man)
(It's unbelievable)

You burden me with your questions
You'd have me tell no lies
You're always asking what it's all about
Don't listen to my replies
You say to me I don't talk enough
But when I do I'm a fool
These times I've spent, I've realized
To shoot through and leave you
The things you say
Your purple prose just gives you away
The things you say
[?] I love you more
The things you say
Your purple prose just gives you away
The things you say
You're unbelievable
Oh! (what the fuck?)
(Good point, what the fuck?)
You're so unbelievable
(...point, what the fuck?)
(...point, what the fuck?)
You're unbelievable
(It's unbelievable)
Oh! (what the fuck?)
(Good point, what the fuck?)
(...point, what the fuck?)
(What the fuck? whoa, man)
You're unbelievable
