I got a feel for pleasure
I got a feel for pain
I got a feel for you girl
Hey baby I'm feeling free again

I got a feel for danger
I gotta feel insane
I got a feel feel for life girl
Hey baby I'm feeling free again

I never thought it'd be like this
Especially with you
I never thought I'd feel like this
Now I'm in love with you

I got a feel for sunshine
I got a feel for rain
I got a feel for you girl
Hey baby I'm feeling free again

I got a feel for Magik
I got a feel for games
I got a love for life girl
Hey baby I'm feeling free again

I never thought it'd be like this
Especially with you
I never thought I'd feel like this
Now I'm love with you

I never thought it'd be like this
No no no not with you
I never tought I'd feel like this
Now I'm in love with you
