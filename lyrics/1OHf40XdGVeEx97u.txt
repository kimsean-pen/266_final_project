Björk
The universe it is so big,
I feel dizzy when I think about it,
My head swims I get giddy,
Still I realize that long ago,
It was so small I could have kept it,
Underneath my little skirt,
At least until the big bang happened,

Einar
Every man, every woman.

Björk
Sun planet the universe and me,
When I'm excited and have to wait,
My organs start to move, my lungs pump,
Cells flow faster on tracks inside me,
I demand to see myself from within,
Be a cell for a day.

Einar
Every man, every woman

Björk
Sun, planet, the universe and me
The universe and me... ooh...
The universe and me, am I a planet? woaah!
The universe and me... woah!
Co-o-ome, na-na-na-hee-ooh!

The planets and me we get along so well together
Gliding down imaginary rollercoaster-paths along the sky
I can do somersaults around Jupiter if I feel like it
Nothing can stop a planet
But a planet can stop anything at all

Einar
Every man, every woman

Björk
Sun planet the universe and me
The universe and me, the universe and me,
The universe and me, the universe and me.
