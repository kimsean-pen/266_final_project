It's crazy how that four letter word gets tossed
And I'm guilty, said it so many times before
But I can't find no more
You're the only one that's showing me the thrills
You're the only one that's giving me these chills

No ex in the past could open up my eyes
Thought I found the one every time
I've said I love you but I lied
Cause love never got me this high
I've said I love you but I lied
Cause love never got me this high

It'd be foolish if they thought they could get me back
See the truth is you can't lose what you never had
And you got me so bad
You're the only one that's showing me the real
You're the only one that's giving me these chills

No ex in the past could open up my eyes
Thought I found the one every time
I've said I love you but I lied
Cause love never got me this high
I've said I love you but I lied
Cause love never got me this high
I've said I love you but I lied
Cause love never got me this high

You got that real love
That text in the morning, that real love
You got that real love
That text in the morning, that real love
How Mary J call it that real love
We got real love

I've said I love you but I lied
Cause love never got me this high
I've said I love you but I lied
Cause love never got me this high
You got my love, cause I'll give my real love
I've said I love you but I lied
Cause love never got me this high

You got that real love
That text in the morning, that real love
How Mary J call it that real love
We got real love
