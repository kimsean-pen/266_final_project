You couldn't tell me that
I'm half the man I thought I was
(It had to come from someone)
You didn't hate me when
I said the things that can't be brushed away
(It's got to end up somewhere)

If I could wake up one day
(If I could) make a change
I wish you know that I would

Every time we fall into the traps we made
For ourselves
Every time we fall into the traps we made
For ourselves, when we where young

You always stuck with me
When everyone else had enough
(You get your strengh from somewhere)
You always stayed with me
When everyone else left me behind
And I was stuck in nowhere)

If I could make up the days
(If I could) run away
You've got to know that I would

Every time we fall into the traps we made
For ourselves
Every time we fall into the traps we made
For ourselves, when we where young

We try our hardest
But the hole is too deep
We try our hardest
But the sides are too steep
And we can we could reach the sunshine
But our arms are too weak

Every time we fall into the traps we made
For ourselves
Every time we fall into the traps we made
For ourselves, when we where young

The traps we made when we were young
