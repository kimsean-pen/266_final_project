So, I been runnin' up the ends, like a track star
Short life, pretty girls, and the fast cars
Rest in peace to my moms, yeah, I miss her
Convolk, up next, with a black heart
Leave me to myself
Don't need nobody else
Yeah, I asked for help
But, no one ever helped
Leave me to myself
My soul, I'm gonna sell
And it ain't hard to tell
That I'm goin' to hell

Get cold, wrist froze, like I told you
Get bands, all alone, like I'm 'sposed to
Don't come to my funeral, I don't know you
I'm next, no flex, 'cause I chose to
Don't have nobody to get close to
Don't have nobody, I got no crew
They tell me I'll come up, I got no clue
I'm dyin' inside, but that old news

So, I been askin', "Where you at, where you at?"
So, I been feelin' sorta mad, sorta mad
So, I been thinkin' 'bout the past, 'bout the past
And, I don't think I really want this shit to last

So, I been runnin' up the ends, like a track star
Short life, pretty girls, and the fast cars (skrrrt!)
Rest in peace to my moms, yeah, I miss her
Convolk, up next, with a black heart
Leave me to myself
Don't need nobody else
Yeah, I asked for help
But, no one ever helped
Leave me to myself
My soul, I'm gonna sell
And it ain't hard to tell
That I'm goin' to hell
