Hey, I'll break the chains
That bind your face
Hey, I long to touch
The sweet embrace

After time, after time, after time

Hey, the walls are burning
Close your eyes
Hey, all done to love
Be far, it fades

After time, be too late, after time

Hey, I'll break the chains
That blind your faith
Hey, I long to touch
The sweet embrace

After time, after time, after time

Hey, the walls are burning
Close your eyes
Hey, all done to love
Be far, it fades

After time, after time, after time
