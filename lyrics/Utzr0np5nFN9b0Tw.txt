Hi, it's Mark Cohen, is Alexi there?
Uhh, no need to bother her
Just let her know that I'm running late for my appointment
I'm at my...
Yes, I'll still be there
Yes, I signed the contract
Thanks

How did we get here? How the hell?
Pan left, close on the steeple of the church
How did I get here? How the hell?
Christmas, Christmas Eve, last year
How could a night so frozen,
Be so scalding hot?
How could a morning so mild,
Be so raw?
Why are entire years strewn
On the cutting room floor of memory?
When single frames of one magic night
Forever flicker in close up
On the 3D Imax of my mind
That's poetic
That's pathetic
Why did Mimi knock on Roger's door
And Collins choose that phone booth
Back where Angel set up his drums
Why did Maureen's equiptment break down
Why am I the witness?
And when I capture it on film
Will it mean that it's the end
And I'm alone
