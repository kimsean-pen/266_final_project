Whoso fly up in th' sky
Faster than any boy could ever describe
Whos got that love so deep
And everything alive

(I said)
Jet Boys fly
Jet Boys gone
Jet Boy stole my baby

Flyin around New York City so high
Like he was my baby

This's the kinda place where no one cares
What your livin for
And Jet Boys so preoccupied
He don't care 'bout before

(That's why)
Jet Boys fly
Jet Boys gone
Jet Boy stole my baby

Flyin around New York City so high
Like he was my baby

My baby...

Jet Boys fly
Jet Boys gone
Jet Boy stole my baby

Flyin around New York City so high
Like he was my baby

We was all endangered charms
Swear we're havin fun
And Jet Boy knows all we done
That's why he's the one

(That's why)
Jet Boys fly
Jet Boys gone
Jet Boy stole my baby

Flyin around New York City so high
Like he was my baby

My pretty baby
My pretty pretty baby
My pretty baby

When I first came around this dump
I knew I couldn't stay
Cus up above the world are Jet Boy
That's why I gotta play

(Dontcha know that)
Jet Boys fly
Jet Boys gone
Jet Boy stole my baby

Flyin around New York City so high
Like he was my baby
Like he was my baby
Like he was my baby
Like he was my baby
Like he was my baby

Jet Boys fly
And ya know he's gone
I said he been gone,
Gone, gone gone

And he been flyin
And he been flyin
He been flyin
He been flyin

Baby up all night
Baby New York City
Baby so so high
Baby so so high

(Dontch know that)
Like he was my baby
Like he was my baby
Like he was my baby

Like he was my my my my baby
My my my my baby
My my my my
My baby
My baby, my baby
M-m-m-m-m-my baby
My baby
