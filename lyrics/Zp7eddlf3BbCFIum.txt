You think that you have seen it all and you don't understand
What is down and above of us and in-between
There's a whole lotta left of the world that you haven't scanned
And the King and the Queen you obey aren't what they seem

You're a danger to yourself
And to me and all my friends
If you underestimate them

Cause they're savage to the bone
And they'll never leave you alone
Until they have taken your head

So war is on us, it's time to begin
We're the bravest ones we'll never give in
No promises, I don't know how this will end
But the Iron Sky comes crumbling down tonight

Waiting here in the dark, trying to breath, it's all too silent
But you're the light and the voice in my head that calms me down
We got a whole lotta left of the world to save from violence
So I dream of a night with you before it gets loud

You're a danger to yourself
And to me and all my friends
If you underestimate them
Cause they're is savage to the bone
And they'll never leave you alone
Until they have taken your head
So

War is on us, it's time to begin
Where the bravest ones will never give in
No promises, I don't know how this will end
But the Iron Sky comes crumbling down tonight

War is on us, it's time to begin
We're the bravest ones we'll never give in
No promises, I don't know how this will end
But the Iron Sky comes tumbling down tonight
Tonight

The Iron Sky comes tumbling down tonight
