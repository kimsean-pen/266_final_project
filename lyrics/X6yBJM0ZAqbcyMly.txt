Fortunately you have
Got someone who relies on you
We started out as friends
But the thought of you just caves me in The symptoms are so deepIt is much too late to turn away
We started out as friends

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my lady

Time I'm sure will bring
Disappointments in so many things
It seems to be the way
When you're gambling cards on love you playI'd rather be in hell with you, baby
Than in cool heavenIt seems to be the way

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my lady

Birds never look into the sun
Before the day is gone
But oh the light shines brightIn a peaceful day
Stranger blue, leave us alone
We don't want to deal with you
We'll shed our stains showering
In the room that makes the rain

All alone with you
Makes the butterflies in me arise
Slowly we make love
And the Earth rotates to ourdictates
Slowly we make love

Heyyyy
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my lady
Sign your name across my heartI want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heartI want you to be my lady
Sign your name across my heartI want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
