How can they say that it's one way when it's the opposite?
And how can they know the end of the story before I tell it?
'Cause when I walk your feet, they fall to the same beat
Or maybe we're from two different worlds, but we got our own language

We talk to people but they never understand
They think we're crazy 'cause it sounds like noise to them
We're speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue
We're speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue

We used to live like we were strangers we didn't know any better
We didn't fit in with the outer crowd so we gave in and we shut our mouths
But oh how I love your history and I can take it
And when you talk in code to me I can translate it

We talk to people but they never understand
They think we're crazy 'cause it sounds like noise to them
Ain't it strange all the things you hear when you sit and listen?
We're speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue
We're speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue

And all this time I've been wasting my breath
Just wasting my woes on everyone else
Now they're speaking in my native
Speaking in my native tongue

So come on, talk it out
So come on
Talk it out
So come on, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk it out
(Your voice brought me back from the dead somehow)

So come on, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk it out
We're speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue
We're speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue
And all this time I've been wasting my breath
Just wasting my woes on everyone else
Now they're speaking in my native
Speaking in my native tongue
