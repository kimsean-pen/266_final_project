Sunlight warms my face only in dreams of you
I know you'll wait for me, it's been too long
Beautiful eyes, beautiful lies to dull the pain
Beautiful eyes, beautiful lies you're killing me

I would wait for years just to feel you again
I will die without you, would you my love?
Beautiful eyes, beautiful lies pour from your mouth
As you scream his name, you're killing me

Cries escape your sweet voice as I kiss you one last time (one last time)

Do you remember me and our beautiful affair?
Look in my eyes and honestly tell me our love is gone
Why have you turned your back on me?
One day you'll wake up and realize your mistake

Ice runs through, as I stand face to face
With the one who stole it all
Compassion is not an option

Cries escape your sweet voice as I kiss you one last time (one last time)

Do you remember me and our beautiful affair?
Look in my eyes and honestly tell me our love is gone
Why have you turned your back on me?
One day you'll wake up and realize your mistake

In love we're one, inseparable, pathetic lust, thus we crumble
I saw eyes, I wiped your tears, I waited for you

Who do you see with your eyes shut tight?
Regret will be your bride, regret will be your bride
Regret will be your bride, goodbye

Do you remember me and our beautiful affair?
Look in my eyes and honestly tell me our love is gone
Why have you turned your back on me?
One day you'll wake up and realize

Cries escape your sweet voice as I paint my own goodbye
