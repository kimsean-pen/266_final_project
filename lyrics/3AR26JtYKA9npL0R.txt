You'll never know
I didn't want it to go the way it went South
Not a word from my mouth
But from the moment I shook your hand
I was determined

When I'm near you I don't speak
I barely look
I'm afraid you'll see it in my face

Each time that honey drips right off of my lips
I never stick, so how'd you get me stuck in this?
Each time that honey drips right off of my lips
And now I wish you never got me stuck in this
But it won't show and you'll never know
I'll lay low and you'll never know

You'll never know
But my left brain took the wrong things East
You've got me all crazy
Come off lazy but I'm more alive on the inside

When I'm near you I can't speak
I never look
I'm afraid you'll see it in my face

Each time that honey drips right off of my lips
I never stick, so how'd you get me stuck in this?
Each time that honey drips right off of my lips
And now I wish you never got me stuck in this
But it won't show and you'll never know
I'll lay low and you'll never know

I was smiling like a lion
Buried myself inside your neck
Oh, West
Clawed my hands around your chest
North with some regret
I've never felt like this
No

You'll never know
