I miss you when you're dead then gone
The price you pay for what I've done
The bad ideas designed for you
Take me down a peg or two

Into the nightmare
Is where we'll run baby
Do you know who I am?
Not been myself lately

'Cause if crazy is
('Cause if crazy is)
As crazy does
(As crazy does)
Then you look a lot like
Falling in love
'Cause you look a lot like
Falling in love

Front row seats to a car crash
What I'd do to get you back
Wish you were here beats in my blood
I played along just because...

Into the nightmare
Is where we'll run baby
Do you know who I am?
Not been myself lately

'Cause if crazy is
('Cause if crazy is)
As crazy does
(As crazy does)
Then you look a lot like
Falling in love
'Cause you look a lot like
Falling in love

Into the nightmare
Is where we'll run baby
Do you know who I am?
Not been myself lately

'Cause if crazy is
('Cause if crazy is)
As crazy does
(As crazy does)
Then you look a lot like
Falling in love
(Falling in love)

Cause if crazy is
('Cause if crazy is)
As crazy does
(As crazy does)
Then you look a lot like
Falling in love
