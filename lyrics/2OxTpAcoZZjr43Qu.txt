It's a step
It's a step in the right direction
It's a tough and final decision
'Cause where will I go when I'm feeling blue?

Spinnin' my wheels
Wastin' my time
Makin' you feel you've nothing to hide

So save me and tell me how it all got so doubtful
Leave me nothing at all
Back on the old road
You're wishing you'll wind me down
Give me a mouthful
And leave me nothing at all

So chalk it up to the drone
Hack it out, wear it down
Where will you go when you're feeling blue?

So save me and tell me how it all got so doubtful
Leave me nothing at all
Back on the old road
You're wishing you'll wind me down
Give me a mouthful
And leave me nothing at all

So save me and tell me how it all got so doubtful
Leave me nothing at all
Back on the old road
You're wishing you'll wind me down
Give me a mouthful
And leave me nothing at all
