the "product" we refer to is well equipped
in the service abilities of your common woman.

defective product
has been known to wreak havoc upon small villages and town folk.

(make that sweet green philiosophical love)

just sign here, initial here, then sign here, here, and here.

(your signature waives responsibility from jones inc.
we apologize for any inconvenience)
