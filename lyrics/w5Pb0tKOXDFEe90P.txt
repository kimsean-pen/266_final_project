I'm feeling pretty dirty baby
Forgive my sins.
I get the feeling you can save me honey,
My herione.

Your hips, my hands, you swing and you dance,
Yea, I'm feeling pretty lonely baby
Just let me in
Just let me in

Your my heroine, just suicide
If I let you in you crawl inside.
Oh you save my skin
She can't wait to sink in
My heroine

I feel a little withdrawl baby,
Come pick me up.
Took a hit from your level
Now I just can't get enough

Your taste, my touch,
A little bit of love and a whole lot of lust.
I'm feeling pretty lonely baby,
So just let me in
Just let me in

Your my heroine, just suicicde
If I let you in you crawl inside.
Oh you save my skin
She can't wait to sink in
My heroine

Your hips, my hands, you swing, and you dance.
I'm feeling pretty lonely baby,
So just let me in

Your my heroine, just suicicde
If I let you in you crawl inside
Oh you save my skin
She can't wait to sink in
My heroine

Your my heroine, just suicicde
If I let you in you crawl inside
Oh you save my skin
She can't wait to sink in
My heroine
