Now the departed, are laid to rest
and the single chance to reconcile is covered with the earth
I heard her screaming, begging to the sky
All the while the numbness culls all decency inside

I bid farewell to those forsaken eyes
But I would hold you when theres nothing left,
I'll never let you down

So sick of trying all the time,
The blood's been spilt, and it is mine
And all thats left to breathe
Are empty words inside my head

All the bullets shall unload, empty casings, callous hold
The loss of one begins to burn,
But I'll take that road when its my turn

I bid farewell to those forsaken eyes
But I would hold you when theres nothing left,
I'll never let you down!

No more will I fall apart...

I bid farewell to those forsaken eyes
But I would hold you when theres nothing left,
I'll never let you down!
