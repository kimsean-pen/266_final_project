Don't kiss goodbye

Your words go straight through my heart
Every time that we dance in the dark
Trusting this feeling 'cause it's meant to be
Just like a wave feel you rush over me

And when I close my eyes
You are all that I see

I got you on my mind
And under my skin
Just the taste of your lips
The sweetest thing
Feels like losing control
So you take the lead
It's like destiny, you and I
Don't kiss goodbye
Don't kiss goodbye

Take me to anywhere you are
Baby you know that there's no place too far
You got me falling, I'm in way too deep
There is no promise that I will not keep

And when I close my eyes
You are all that I see

I got you on my mind
And under my skin
Just the taste of your lips
The sweetest thing
Feels like losing control
So you take the lead
It's like destiny, you and I
Don't kiss goodbye
Don't kiss goodbye

I got you on my mind
And under my skin
Just the taste of your lips
The sweetest thing
Feels like losing control
So you take the lead
It's like destiny, you and I
Don't kiss goodbye
Don't kiss goodbye
Don't kiss goodbye
Don't kiss goodbye
