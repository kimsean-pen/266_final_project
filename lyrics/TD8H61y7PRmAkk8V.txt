Am I created in the image of my "Father God"?
Am I created in an image? What I had I lost
Am I created in an image what I want to see?
I am created in the image of suffering
I'm suffering
Calling all your heavy laden
Graceless
All suffering

Calling all you heavy laden
Faceless

Manna machine

I'm suffering
Suffering
We're all suffering
Suffering
Yeah I really really want it to end

Calling all your heavy laden graceless
All suffering
Calling all your heavy laden
Faceless

Manna machine

Who do you think you are?
You and all your suffering?

You call it
Like the manna machine
You call it
Like the manna machine
But I am
Suffering

Created in the image of suffering
Created in the image of suffering
Suffering
Created in the image of suffering
Suffering
Created in the image of suffering
