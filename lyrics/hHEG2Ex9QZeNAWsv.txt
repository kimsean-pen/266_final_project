Foul and tainted, putrid in spite
Departed, serene, deceived in faith
Emanated and ruptured in creed
Condemned forever, captured in doom

Devoured in oblivion, redeemed in gloom
And abandon demise, I stare in eternal despair of yore

Perseverant and keen, I endure the curse
In boundless spirits, the faith of gods

Devoured in oblivion, redeemed in gloom
And abandon demise, I stare in eternal despair of yore
The seventh aeon elating, the bringer of light enfolding its vigor
In a halo of light, I bare as remaining grandeur once more

Shrouded in silence, unhallowed black sermon
Condemned forever, captured in doom

Devoured in oblivion, redeemed in gloom
And abandon demise, I stare in eternal despair of yore
The seventh aeon elating, the bringer of light enfolding its vigor
In a halo of light, I bare as remaining grandeur no more
