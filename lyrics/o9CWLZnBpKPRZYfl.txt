Stuck, in, my, mind
Get, me, out

I been sad, I been tryna get a grip
I been getting mad at shit that don't make sense to me
If only you knew about my brain and everything that goes through it
Daydream about all the sex and the ritual sacrifice I could commit
Throwing your heart to Amitt

Kill the machines
Watching the world fall apart at the seams
What if they learned to breathe?
Upload my consciousness when I'm deceased
Around my neck, rep the crest, till I take a rest
Trying to avoid droid ploys, won't escape (noise)

Locked, in, my, mind
Get, me, out
(Find a safe place)

Get, me, out
