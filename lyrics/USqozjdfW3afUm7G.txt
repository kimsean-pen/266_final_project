I used to care so much about what others think about
Almost didn't have a thought of my own
The slightest remark would make me embark on a journey of self doubt
But that was a while ago

This girl has got stronger
And if I knew then what I know now
I would have told myself don't worry any longer
It's OK

'Cause a face without freckles is like a sky without the stars
Why waste a second not loving who you are?
Those little imperfections make you beautiful, loveable, valueable
They show your personality inside your heart
Reflecting who you are

(Who you are, who you are, who you are
Oh, yeah yeah, ah)

I wondered if I could trade my body with some body else in magazines
With the whole world fall at my feet
I felt unworthy and would blame my failures on the ugliness I could see
When the mirror looked at me

(Sometimes I feel)

Sometimes I still feel like a little girl who doesn't belong in the wrong world
But I'll get it better by reminding myself

That a face without freckles is like a sky without the stars
Why waste a second not loving who you are?
Those little imperfections make you beautiful, loveable, valueable
They show your personality inside your heart
Reflecting who you are

(Who you are)

Reflecting who you are
Reflecting who you are
Ummm, ooh ooh ooh, oh

'Cause a face without freckles is like a sky without the stars
Why waste a second not loving who you are?
Those little imperfections make you beautiful, loveable, valueable
They show your personality inside your heart
Reflecting who you are
