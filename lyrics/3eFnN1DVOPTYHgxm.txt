Used to roll in perfect motion, easy
Lips like Tanqueray
Tropical sunrises, never sleeping
I don't know what changed
All I want to do is feel the rhythm of the night
You've been running from the dark
You can't look me in the eyes
Being called into the heat even if it's burning me
I just need to dance without you

We can't move to this, we can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss, it never works
We can't move to this, we can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss, you're not in love
We can't move to this, we can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss, it never works
We can't move to this, we can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss

Through the streets and all the places I've been
I can see we never had harmony
I won't go even though I'm alone and I know I want out
I go up without you bringing me down
Such a rush, so now I'm staying to dance on my own,
On my own, and all I know is

We can't move to this, we can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss, it never works
We can't move to this, we can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss, you're not in love
We can't move to this, we can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss, it never works
We can't move to this, we can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss, you're not in love

Now I'm giving you up tonight, now I'm giving you up tonight
And I'm dancing on my own because we can't move together
Now I'm giving you up tonight, now I'm giving you up tonight
And I'm dancing on my own because we can't move together
Now I'm giving you up tonight, now I'm giving you up tonight
And I'm dancing on my own because we can't move together
Now I'm giving you up tonight, now I'm giving you up tonight
And I'm dancing on my own because we can't move to...

We can't move to this, we can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss, it never works
We can't move to this, we can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss, you're not in love
We can't move to this, we can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss, it never works
We can't move to this, we can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss, I'm not in love
