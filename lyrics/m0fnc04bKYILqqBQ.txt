We'll make our agreements
About when to meet
And I'll leave you in the doorway
The cold evening aches
As it leaves in its wake
All the memories left by the day
And I'm questioning why
As you look to the sky
That is cloudless up above our heads
And thoughts come to mind
That our short little lives
Haven't left the path that they will tread

They will tread

I'll come back to haunt you
Memories will taunt you
And I will try to love you
It's not like I'm above you

What wisdom we learn as our minds
They do burn
All the ties to naivety and youth
As adults we'll grow and maturity shows
All the terrifying rarity of truth
As you turn to your mind
And your thoughts they rewind
To old happenings and things that are done
You can't find what's passed
Make that happiness last
Seeing from those eyes what you've become

What you've become

I'll come back to haunt you
Memories will taunt you
And I will try to love you
It's not like I'm above you

I will see you there
See you there
See you there
See you there
I will see you there
See you there
See you there
See you there
I'll come back to haunt you
Memories will taunt you
And I will try to love you
It's not like I'm above you
