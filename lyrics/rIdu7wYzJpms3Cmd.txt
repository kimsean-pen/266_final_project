Archegonic disaster
Into the depths of mind
A merciless mockery
Of an innocent soul
Into the dark planet
Like a demon, a hellspawn
Hymns and chants
In thy altar of putrid existence

Eternal sacrifice
Unspeakable silence

I ride the eternal winds
I look the crimson skies
I'll find the gates of abyss
I hear the voice of him
I pray the mighty one
I seek the utter salvation

Lust for the birth
Womb that gives life
And pukes curses
Curses and miasmas

I ride the eternal winds
I look the crimson skies
I'll find the gates of abyss
I hear the voice of him
I pray the mighty one
I seek the utter salvation

Monks raped and sodomized
In the name of false god
priests decapitated
In the name of a holy truth

The age of magic
Forever immortal

I ride the eternal winds
I look the crimson skies
I'll find the gates of abyss
I hear the voice of him
I pray the mighty one
I seek the utter salvation
