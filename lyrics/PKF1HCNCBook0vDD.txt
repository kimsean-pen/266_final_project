We're too young to know what love is, our loss
cynical eyes, scanning the room for meaning
maybe youth is wasted on the young, our loss
Travel in parks, drinking our teenage spirit

Maybe we're all clean cut criminals
running fast to blur the visuals
And I'm not sure I've got the heart for this
maybe that's the hardest part of it

If we're brave enough
we won't save it up for later
come on show me what
come on show me what you're made of
start the engine up
come on show me what you're made of
we're not damaged goods, maybe we're just lonely people

And I feel like we're total strangers, so I
Monopoly minds, following blind to danger
This feels like a race against the clock, tick tock
And all of our tears, rolling off silver medals

not sure I've got the heart for this
maybe that's the hardest part of it

If we're brave enough
we won't save it up for later
come on show me what
come on show me what you're made of
start the engine up
come on show me what you're made of
we're not damaged goods, maybe we're just lonely people

Don't you save a word for later, tell me just what you're thinking
give me something to believe in
Don't you save a word for later, tell me just what you're thinking
give me something to believe in

Do we have the time to justify
All these sins we try and glorify
I think we're gonna regret these haircuts

If we're brave enough
we won't save it up for later
come on show me what
come on show me what you're made of
start the engine up
come on show me what you're made of
we're not damaged goods, maybe we're just lonely people

Don't you save a word for later, tell me just what you're thinking
give me something to believe in
maybe we're just lonely people
Don't you save a word for later, tell me just what you're thinking
give me something to believe in
maybe we're just lonely people
