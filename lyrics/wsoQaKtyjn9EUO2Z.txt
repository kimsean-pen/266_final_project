I'm tired of waiting for things to change, yeah
I've exhausted all the patience I have, yeah
So baby when you come home tonight
(Let's pretend every thing's all right)
Let's pretend every thing's all right
Baby come and take the rain away

Baby take the rain away
Make it come again some other day
Let's pretend every thing's okay
Baby take the rain away
(Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby)
Oh, baby
(Take the rain away)

Just for tonight let's leave our problems behind, yeah
Let's lose ourselves in passion for one night
So baby when you come home tonight
(Let's pretend every thing's all right)
Let's pretend every thing's all right
Baby come and take the rain away

Baby take the rain away
Make it come again some other day
Let's pretend every thing's okay
Baby take the rain away
(Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby)
Oh, baby
(Take the rain away)

Kiss the rain drops on my face
Only you can take me from this place
On a cloud let's ride away
We can disagree another day

(Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby)
(Oh, baby take the rain away)
Baby
(Let's pretend every thing's okay)
Baby
(Take the rain away)

(Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby take the rain away)
Baby take the rain away
Make it come again some other day
Let's pretend every thing's okay
Baby come and take the rain away
(Take the rain away)

(Baby take the rain away)
Baby take the rain away
(Make it come again some other day)
Make it come again some other day
(Let's pretend every thing's okay)
Everything's okay
Baby
(Take the rain away)
Take the rain away

(Baby take the rain away)
Take the rain away
Take the rain away
(Make it come again some other day)
Rain away, rain away, rain away
Rain away, rain away, rain away
(Let's pretend every thing's okay)
