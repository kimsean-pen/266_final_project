Hear now this story of the man that should not be
A ghoul of blackened torment, sullen atrocity
A kindred soul to the devils own, malignance personified
Cast from his fire he molests the purest light

Profane to humanity menaced by flesh and bone
Screams of the unknown youth to him the sweetest tone
Undying in his will to kill his bloodlust is profound
For the blood of the lamb I've got to bring him down

Chorus
For all the young lives you have slain
Fear now you shall obtain
Vengeance is mine
For every young one that has died
Your psychopathic genocide
Vengeance is mine

I shall do what the law won't do, I can make the sacrifice
In the name of these bodies
which held such precious life
Mine is not to ask forgiveness this deed I've proudly done
Without god without the devil this time I have won

Repeat Chorus
