Can we still, still pretend for a while?
Can I still steal a moment of your time?
If I breathe, if I breathe in you my life
Will it bring it back in rewind?
Can I still pretend you're mine?

A thousand miles that I've still gotta run
And I hear you calling
A million ways to fix what we've become
To keep us from falling
We crash, we crawl, we bend and break
Try not to make the same mistakes
A thousand miles that I've still gotta run
And I hear you calling out

Can we still, still pretend for a while?
Can I still keep on walking on a wire?
If I can't if I can't hold back the tide
Can I bring it back in rewind
Can I still pretend you're mine?
Oh can I still pretend you're mine?

A thousand miles that I've still gotta run
And I hear you calling
A million ways to fix what we've become
To keep us from falling
We crash, we crawl, we bend and break
Try not to make the same mistakes
A thousand miles that I've still gotta run
And I hear you calling out

And we'll turn around and rise now
'Till all our fears come falling down
Is this the cause, the price to pay?
For the regrets of yesterday
Can we still, still pretend for a while?

A thousand miles that I've still gotta run
And I hear you calling
A million ways to fix what we've become
To keep us from falling
We crash, we crawl, we bend and break
Try not to make the same mistakes
A thousand miles that I've still gotta run
And I hear you calling out
And I hear you calling out
And I hear you calling out
