Never thought that love and sadness
Could ever walk hand in hand
Never thought that laughter and sorrow
Could live within this same heart

We came far living on stolen moments
We can pretend for only so long
We all fail, stumble and fall
We are the same 'till the end in fire

Out to the sea I cry my heart
Into the wind I weep my sorrows
Below this soil I lay my thoughts
Under the waves I drown my grief

Out to the sea you cry your heart
Into the wind you weep your sorrows
Below this soil we lay our thoughts
Under the waves we drown our grief

You were the one I believed in
I was the one worth your trust
But stars no longer will guide us
We walk in all-consuming dark

For life shapes us an we never return
To the same where we left from
Hope always looks for a disappointment
And tranquility for a war

And I sail this sea in a leaking ship
Try to cross an ocean without a sheet
No wind will carry me to the shore
No wave will take me back to home

You are in the silence around me
You are the water in my lungs
You are in escaping daylight
As we dance our way into the dark

Into the dark...
