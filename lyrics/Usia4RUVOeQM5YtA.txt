This ain't hoping
We're hoping for a dark cold winter sun
My body is bitter cold
My mind is overthrown
Since the world is full of roles that we play
And as long as we do there's no time to regret
All the ways how you and i had come together

Bright lies shine on
Illusions past ages ago
From a distance
See myself existing
Pretend to fear your undertone

I see bright lies shine on
Illusions past ages ago
From a distance
See myself existing
Pretend to fear your undertone

Ophelia I leave my broken bones in the desert
Ophelia I leave my broken bones in the desert

This ain't hoping
We're hoping for a dark cold winter sun
My body is bitter cold
My mind is overthrown

Ophelia I leave my broken bones in the desert
Ophelia I leave my broken bones in the desert

Bright lies shine on
Illusions past ages ago
From a distance
See myself existing
Pretend to fear your undertone

I see bright lies shine on
Illusions past ages ago
From a distance
See myself existing
Pretend to fear your undertone

Ophelia I leave my broken bones in the desert
Ophelia I leave my broken bones in the desert

You wouldn't tell if you go there
You wouldn't tell if you go there
You wouldn't tell if you go there
You wouldn't tell if you go there
You wouldn't tell if you go there
You wouldn't tell if you go there
You wouldn't tell if you go there
You wouldn't tell if you go there

See the world is full of roles
Oh babe oh baby la la la la
It's enough
See the world is full of roles
Oh babe oh baby la la la la
It's enough
