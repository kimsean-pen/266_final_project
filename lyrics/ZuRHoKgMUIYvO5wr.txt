Wild, astride the Devil's thunder.
I ride until the death, cross hell and burning .
Untamed, a scourge The flame, the source;
I am legion, for we are many who approach
At the crumbling skyline.

Outlaw - In the heavens and so alike on earth.
Outlaw - In spirit and so alike in flesh.
Nightmares... beyond the deepest darkness;
Bonded by rebel blood;
Breaking the chains of slavery;
Breaking the chains of god.
Onwards to the other side
On a wild ride...

Sons of Hades, wolves yet men.
Deathlike, silent; forever damned
Your world, a cage. We tear its bars.
Live fast, die hard. Fucking worlds and shooting stars

Outlaw - In the heavens and so alike on earth.
Outlaw - In spirit and so alike in flesh.
Wild Ones! From churning chasms of anarchy
Defiant we proclaim our liberty.
Riding against the tide
Into certain Death!
