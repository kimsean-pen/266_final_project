Monday you came
and everything you own it's mine
dark is bright
and all that I see it's light

Slowly again
quickly grows behind the wall
up is down
you know what everything's about
around
word by word

Friday I came
straight to death inside my bed
gold is black
and all that I see it's dark

Slowly today
glowing fast under the floor
day or night
I know what everything's about
around
word by word
