Run boy run
Run boy run
Run boy run
Run boy run

Here she comes
Here she comes
She's coming for you
So run boy run
Run boy run

Here she comes
Here she comes
She's coming for you

'Cos these are tears of joy not woe
'Cause woe-betide I open wide and let inside the flow
These are cries of pain, rejoice
They are heartfelt and coarse
Can you not tell from the pain?

So run boy run boy
Run boy run
She's coming for you

Happy faces alone
Happy faces alone
Happy faces alone
Happy faces alone

So run boy run boy
Run boy run
She's coming for you

Happy faces alone
Happy faces alone
Happy faces alone
Happy faces alone

In these, the times of unhealthy regret It's the last cigarette and all the lonely days ahead

These the times of you wish you would
When all the bridges have been burned
And she slowly turns

So run boy run boy
Run boy run
She's coming for you

Happy faces alone
Happy faces alone
Happy faces alone
Happy faces alone

So run boy run boy
Run boy run
She's coming for you

Happy faces alone
Happy faces alone
Happy faces alone
Happy faces alone

Happy faces alone Happy face

So run boy run boy
Run boy run boy
Run boy run boy
Run boy run

So run boy run boy
Run boy run boy
Run boy run boy
Run boy run
