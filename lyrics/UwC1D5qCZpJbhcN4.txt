I have no name my face a blur
I speak only to answer them
White noise becomes a voice
I hear it constantly

I dare not break the circuit
I rest only for a short time
This time I promise I won't give up

I have no right to let it go
I have no right to do so

My vision now is incomplete
I am affected by the warmth
A change of tone unusual sound
Is this the time to decline

I dare not break the circuit
I rest only for a short time
This time I promise I won't give up

I have no right to let it go
I have no right to do so

They control the circuit
The embodiment of what I've done
If I waver from this circle
A second pass and then I'm found
But he who walks behind me
He once saw the morning sun

I dare not break the circuit
I rest only for a short time
This time I promise I won't give up

I have no right to let it go
I have no right to do so
