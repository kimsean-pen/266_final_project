Payday, and I'm overdue
Holding out, holding out for you,
We go climbing up the glass walls,
Pricey hights and free falls,
Some days it pays to jump the queue
Found myself in bad company,
it still beats the monotony,
I get lost in the irony,
but it still beats the monotony
Dysfunctional in every way,
we drive all night and sleep all day,
Caught up in the conflict,
puts me on edge but I like the feeling,
Death feels to everything I say,
beginning to wonder why I stay,
caught up in the conflict,
puts me on edge but I like the feeling,
Stay or talk, in bitten tongues,
We sit on mute, and play along,
but there's something about the silence,
can't speak when we're all breathless,
the disconnection feels wrong,
Mistake the mindless for bravery,
Climbing, taking the scenery,
I get lost in the irony,
yeah
Overcrowded and lonely,
Dysfunctional in every way,
we drive all night and sleep all day,
Caught up in the conflict,
puts me on edge but I like the feeling,
Death feels to everything I say,
beginning to wonder why I stay,
caught up in the conflict,
puts me on edge but I like the feeling,
Am I a pain in your side? Oh,
cause your a pain in mine,
Oceans of car parks and street lights, and no one around,
We don't get along too well so we don't make a sound,
Dysfunctional in every way,
we drive all night and sleep all day,
Caught up in the conflict,
puts me on edge but I like the feeling,
Death feels to everything I say,
beginning to wonder why I stay,
caught up in the conflict,
puts me on edge but I like the feeling,
Am I a pain in your side?
Puts me on edge but I like the feeling,
Cause you're the pain in mine,
Puts me on edge but I like the feeling,
Am I a pain in your side?
Puts me on edge but I like the feeling,
Cause you're the pain in mine,
Puts me on edge but I like the feeling.
