Even if I never told the truth
When I said I always knew
Even when I felt confused
I always had sides to choose
And when I suddenly lost my track
I managed to find my way back
And fight for you

Little darling, don't cry
You can see rainbows in the night
Little one, uncover your eyes
We can rewrite this naked lie

We'll be alright now, we'll be alright now
My love is like a real obsession to win
Dream on, you win your peace
Flew closer with the wings of doves
Don't weep, don't weep no more
Keep singing, you'll discover
The reason why we love each other

Little darling, don't cry
We can paint rainbows through the night
Little one, uncover your eyes
We can rewrite these awful lies

Even if we slept a million times
Even if you felt you were disguised
Even in a world of black and white
Still tryna reach the highest highs
You know when I lost my tracks
I managed to jump right, jump right back
And fight for you

Little darling, don't cry
We can paint rainbows through the night
Little one, uncover your eye
We can rewrite this awful lie
