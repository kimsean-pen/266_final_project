Hey. I don't like your friends. I don't want to wake up. I don't want to wake up in a new era pulled from the middle. Days replacing weeks. Months in my own bed, on the l train, in the same day. I'll see you tonight. Make you less refined. I'm so happy i could die. Hey. Don't look so down. Just look around. You were right.
