I sense you close
I can taste your smile
Cut the wire and wait for me outside
As you release remain close and still
Still

We are useless beneath this trance of mine
Everyone watching us wave it around
And the fangs start coming out

Escape, Escape

Now is your life a crime
Well I can fix it
I control Time
I can change the whole thing

I can do what you say and I will never speak A word about it
I'll replace all the paintings while everybody is looking down
And we can taste a life we knew existed I put it back
Now were Living, Breathing Loud

Surprise now this resembles the life that I love
A picture perfect phase of our love
But It's a newer state of mind.
Of mine

Escape, Escape
