Little Joanna's got big blue eyes
Coconut cream and coffee colored thighs
I could die lying in her arms
Where castles are made of sand
We start to dance
But only the music is bleeding when crickets replace the band

CHORUS:
She will always be my sunkissed trampoline,
She goes up and down in my heart,
Turned into jelly beans
And I'm starting to believe that danger's never near,
When Joanna is here!

Little Joanna's like a lazerbeam sky.
GLuteos Maximus like a firefly
And That's why I'm a kissaphobic
Where cellulite dreams were made, like lemonade,
But when the shivers are salty and sea foam's the colour of space.

CHORUS:
She will always be my sunkissed trampoline,
She goes up and down in my heart,
Turned into jelly beans
And i'm starting to believe that danger's never near,
When Joanna is here.

God, I love Joanna
But she don't understand much
I love it when our hands touch
Knowing that I'm near

Apple-flavored lip gloss
Achilles were's a necklace
I'm feeling young and reckless
When Joanna is here

Little Joanna's got big blue eyes
I could die lying in her arms
where castles are made of sand
We start to dance
But only the music is bleeding when crickets replace the band

CHORUS:
She will always be my sunkissed trampoline,
She goes up and down in my heart,
Turned into jelly beans
And i'm starting to believe that danger's never near,
Oh when Joanna is here

when joanna is near
sunkissed remedy
up and down im my heart x7
