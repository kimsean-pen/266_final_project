See the medal reverse
This hope is not lost
It's mischief to turn
Your ship to send off

And gowns
We'll ransack this town
I'd rescue here and now
In velvet you'll drown

Oh, austere
Lay by my side
You've been left here
So don't make a sound
Keep your word
Don't let me down
Just
Destroy me now

Destroy me now
