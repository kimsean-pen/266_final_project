I listened back in the confines
I set within myself
The words fell on deaf ears
In their own little hell
I head the loss reverb
All around your voice
The kind of space that holds the room
Leaves me little choice

We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint
Stay convinced
We'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint
Stay convinced
And that we might see a sign
For what it is

We'll chalk it up to blind luck
Metaphors, or doubt
After years of searching
It's almost working out
If you don't like the format
You set the music to
You can change the rhythm
You choose to feel it through

We'll say what we want
We'll say what we want
I'm learning to take a hint
Stay convinced
We'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
We're willingly lost
I'm learning to take a hint
Stay convinced
That we might see a sign
For what it is

I might be playing too close to that flame
I'll tip the scales to push the water away
In between two different worlds far apart
We'll swim safely through the dark
And carry on

We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
We'll say what we want
(We'll say what we want)
I'm learning to take a hint
Stay convinced
We'll see the other side
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
We're willingly lost
(We're willingly lost)
I'm learning to take a hint
Stay convinced
That we might see a sign
