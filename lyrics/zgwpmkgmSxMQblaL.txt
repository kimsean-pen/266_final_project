My life reads like the classifieds
Pages of what's for sale
What's on the auction block
Attention bidders
It's Lot 45
He's got a decent voice
He's got that crooked smile

Hold on
You haven't heard the best yet
He writes good story lines
He's got those honest eyes
So take him home for just $9.95
He'll sing the songs you like
He'll keep you warm at night

Back down
Cash out
That's the city for you
Break down
Back out
And get what's coming to you
When you said you were falling apart
I thought you meant that you were falling apart

I'm not the type to forget about
Nights like this
When every single move that I make
Is documented and scored for style points
The once ambitious one now holds the smoking gun

And if I die in my sleep
Are you still willing to be
Everything you promised you would be

Back down
Cash out
That's the city for you
Break down
Back out
And get what's coming to you
When you said you were falling apart
I thought you meant that you were falling apart

Will you be the first one to tell the neighborhood papers
And all my family and friends that still care?
Did you buy what I sold
Did you feel what I told you
I hope that you still do
Will you
Promise yourself that this isn't all we've got

Back down
Cash out
That's the city for you
Break down
Back out
And get what's coming to you
When you said you were falling apart
I thought you meant that you were falling apart
