Sky, so vast is the sky
And far away clouds just wandering by.
Where do they go?
Oh I don't know, don't know...

Wind that speaks to the leaves
Telling stories that no one believes
Stories of love
Belong to you and me...

Oh Dindi...
If I only had words
I would say all the beautiful things that I see
When you're with me
oh my Dindi

Oh Dindi...
Like the song of the wind in the trees
That's how my heart is singing Dindi, happy Dindi
When you're with me

I love you more today
Yes I do, yes I do
I'd let you go away
If you take me with you

Don't you know Dindi
I'd be running and searching for you
Like a river that can't find the see
That would be me
Without you my Dindi
