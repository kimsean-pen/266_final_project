I look at you, and all I wanna do is just disappear, oh, uh, uh
I got a craving for you, baby
Can we get out of here, oh, uh, uh

You're a sexy machine
You're a Hollywood dream
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen

Let's drop out of this crowd
Somewhere no one's allowed
I want you, uh, uh, uh

All to myself
I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah
You don't need no other lover
We can keep it undercover

Find me in the shadows
And put the shades down until tomorrow
And make sure that no-nobody follows, yeah
You don't need no other lover
We can keep it undercover

You don't need no other lover
We can keep it undercover

I wanna find a place where
We can be alone in the dark, oh, uh, uh
And you can navigate me
Like a map that you know by heart, oh, uh, uh

You're a sexy machine
You're a Hollywood dream
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen

Let's drop out of this crowd
Somewhere no one's allowed
I want you, uh, uh, uh

All to myself
I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah
