Now all the secrets you have learned
Got to be shared with everyone around
It's by your acts that the things that you know
Turn into facts and build a bridge of love
And once you understand
So simple and profound
The future's in your hands
Go spread the word around

Stars are calling you
With a message to the world
Telling how our soul will survive
Perfect symmetry
Give the message to the world
Share your love and reach for the skies
Why do you refuse to trust?
Your tiny mind against the universe

And all the rest of you
Who are laughing at me now
What's said might not ne true
Go see what will be found
Stars are calling you
With a message to the world
Telling how our soul will survive
Perfect symmetry
Give the message to the world
Share your love and reach for the skies
