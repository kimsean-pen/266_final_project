You put a spell on me with your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
And you got me so hooked on your drug
Your drug, your drug, your drug, your drug

And when I sleep you haunt my dreams
What does this mean? You haunt my dreams

You have a way with me and you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
And I just cant seem to let go
Let go, let go, let go, let go

And when I sleep you haunt my dreams
What does this mean? You haunt my dreams
