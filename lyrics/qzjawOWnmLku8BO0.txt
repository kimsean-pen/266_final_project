The burning desire
To live and roam free
It shines in the dark
And it grows within me
You're holding my hand

but you don't understand
So where I am going
you wont be in the end
I'm dreaming in colors

Of getting the chance
Of dreaming of trying

the perfect romance
The search of the door
to open your mind
In search of the cure of mankind

Help us were drowning
So close up inside
Why does it rain, rain, rain down on utopia?
Why does it have to kill the idea of who we are?
Why does it rain, rain, rain down on utopia?

How will the lights die down, telling us who we are?
I'm searching for Answers
not given for free
your hurting inside

is there life within me?
You're holding my hand

but you don't understand
you're taking the road
all alone in the end
I'm dreaming in colors

no boundaries are there
I'm dreaming the dream
we are passing to share
In search of the door
to open your mind
In search of the cure of mankind
Help us we're drowning
So close up inside
Why does it rain, rain, rain down on utopia
Why does it have to kill the idea of who we are?
Why does it rain, rain, rain down on utopia?
And when the lights die down, telling us who we are
Why does it rain, rain, rain down on utopia
Why does it have to kill the idea of who we are?
Why does it rain, rain, rain down on utopia
And when the lights die down, telling us who we are
Why does it rain?
