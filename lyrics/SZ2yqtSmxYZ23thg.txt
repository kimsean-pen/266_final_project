I can't find it in my heart to take this too far

You've been dead to me before, but I come back for more

Forgive but don't forget. you "never meant it"
But you did, you did

But if you run with me
I'll run with you too (I'll run with you too)
Runners ruin on the go. I'll end up all alone
But I'll run with you

My head is wrapped in a mess. there's no more control

I just needed your kiss. but you don't want it
To live without your love, I couldn't stand it. but you could (you did)

If you run with me
I'll run with you (I'll run with you)
Lovers' ruin on the go. we'll end up all alone
But I'll run with you

I just needed your kiss. but you don't want it
To live without your love, I couldn't stand it. but you could (you did)

I couldn't stand it
I couldn't stand it
