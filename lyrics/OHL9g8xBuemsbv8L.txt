Every time I think of you
It always turns out good
Every time I've held you
I thought you understood
People say a love like ours
Will surely pass
But I know a love like ours
Will last and last

But maybe I was wrong
Not knowing how our love should go
(How our love, how our love should go)
But I wasn't wrong
In knowing how our love would grow
(How our love, how our love would grow)
(And every time I think of you)
Every time
(Every time I think of you)
Every single time
(It always turns out good)

Seasons come and seasons go
But our love will never die
Let me hold you darling
So you won't cry
'Cause people say that our love affair
Will never last
But we know a love like ours
Will never pass

But maybe I was wrong
Not knowing how our love should go
(How our love, how our love should go)
But I wasn't wrong
In knowing how our love would grow
(How our love, how our love would grow)
(And every time I think of you)
Every time
(Every time I think of you)
Every single time
(It always turns out good)

People say a love like ours
Will surely pass
But I know a love like ours
Will last and last

But maybe I was wrong
Not knowing how our love should go
(How our love, how our love should go)
But I wasn't wrong
In knowing how our love would grow
(How our love, how our love would grow)
And every time I think of you
Every time I think of you
Every time I think of you
It always turns out good
Every time I think of you
Every time I think of you
Every time I think of you (every time)
Every time I think of you (think of you)
Every time I think of you (every time)
Every time I think of you (think of you)
Every time I think of you (every time)
Every time I think of you (think of you)
Every time I think of you (every time)
Every time I think of you (think of you)
