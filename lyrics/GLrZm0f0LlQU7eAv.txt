Let's make something clear
We're recording this as it happens
Those diamond bullets, storefront blood banks
Splinters and stained glass
Don't need to move a single prayer bone
Dodge bullets so loud and so low
Don't need to move a single prayer bone
Our death is still life

So what's a nice place like this
Doing 'round people like us?
So what's a nice place like this
Doing 'round people like us?

We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live
We'll burn it down, burn it down
They won't even recognise your corpse

The world was stripped of the superficial surfaces
We don't intend to just eat the street
The asphalt is the good meat

And we will sleep on the skin of his nightmares
We will sleep on the skin of his nightmares
Time to just kill this crowd, scream this fuckin' loud

We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live
We'll burn it down, burn it down
They won't even recognise your corpse

Fire fire fire fire fire away
Fire fire fire fire fire away
Fire fire fire fire fire away
Fire fire fire fire fire fire fire away

I love the sound of shells hitting the ground, man
I love the sound of shells hitting the ground
I love it

I love the sound of shells hitting the ground, man
I love the sound of shells hitting the ground
I love it
I love it

Fire fire fire away
Fire fire fire away
Fire fire fire, fire fire fire
Fire fire fire, fire fire fire, fire fire fire

We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live
We'll burn it down, burn it down
They won't even recognise your corpse

We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live
I know where you fucking live
We know where you fucking live

So what's a nice place like this
Doing 'round people like us?
So what's a nice place like this
