My child's coming back, back from the dead again
My child's coming back, back from the dead again
Gonna hum the A B Cs to her
She smiles at my man that fathered me beyond my years
She smiles at the boy that turned to one inside of us
Gonna sing the A B Cs to her

Ah-ah-ah-ah, A, B to C
Ah-ah-ah-ah, A, B to C
And C, you see, ceases to be my child

My child's sleep has caused all awakening
My child's sleep has caused all awakening
Gonna hum the A B Cs to her
My child's coming back, back from the sea I say
My child's coming back, back to the me today
Gonna howl the A, B, Cs to her

This sleep in me has caused me to awaken
The burning lure has drowsed me years ago
