"Is it on?"
"Uhhh, yeah."
"Alright."

Lazy gun messed up my television, yeah
You get no younger from those colours in your hair
You teach your kids how they're all young enough to fight
You talk about the answer, tell them they're all right

Change nothing
Future's in
Close the door
Wear a name
Be the same
Take some more

Lazy gun messed up my television fun
Shoot the shotgun but the war is never won
Who's the enemy who's sucking all my sun?
I'm the only one left now, you've taken all my fun

Change nothing
The future's in
Close the door
Wear a name
Be the same
Take some more

Change nothing
The future's in
Close the door

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm

Change nothing
The future's in
Close the door
Wear a name
Be the same
Take some more

Change nothing
The future's in
Close the door
