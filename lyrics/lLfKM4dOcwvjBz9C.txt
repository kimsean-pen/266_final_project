I can feel it now it's time
Open your eyes
Fears be gone it won't be long
There's a light in the sky

It's okay to look outside
The day it will abide
An' watch the sunrise

Sun, it shines on all of us
We are one in it's hands
Come inside and light my room
Like the heart of every man

It's okay
(Okay)
To look outside
(Outside)
The day it will abide
(Day it will abide)
An' watch the sunrise

Haa haa, haa haa
Haa haa, haa haa

I can feel it, now it's time
Open your eyes
Fears be gone it won't be long
There's a light in the sky

It's okay
(Okay)
To look outside
(Outside)
Your love it will abide
(Love it will abide)
An' watch the sunrise
