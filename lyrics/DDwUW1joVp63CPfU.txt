Shoot the runner, shoot shoot the runner
I'm a king and she's my queen
Shoot the runner, shoot shoot the runner
I'm a king and she's my queen

Dream, dream again in your way
Always knew that you would
Lose yourself to the scene
Am I only a dream

Shoot the runner, shoot shoot the runner
I'm a king and she's my queen, bitch

Bang, bang away with my chang
Always know that I can
Get you on to the floor
Absinthe make you a whore

Shoot the runner, shoot shoot the runner
I'm a king and she's my queen
Shoot the runner, shoot shoot the runner
I'm a king and she's my queen, bitch

Kings, kings they come and they go
By this sword you must know
All things come and then pass
Live your days like the rest
Aahh. And you're my queen, that's it
Shoot shoot the runner
Cause I'm a King and you're my Queen, bitch.
