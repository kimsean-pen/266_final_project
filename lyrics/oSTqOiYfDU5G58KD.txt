Things they never say. Sleep it all away.
Things you'd like to know. Through a dream.
See it, in his eyes
Follow it by heart
Moving out of it
I want to know how it feels to move on.
How it feels. How it feels.
All of it is fake
Announced by a mistake.
I thought I had it all clear, hear, clear,
But there's some things you really don't need to hear.
