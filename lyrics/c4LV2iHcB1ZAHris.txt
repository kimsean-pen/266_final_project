I said shotgun
Shoot 'em for he run now
Do the jerk baby
Do the jerk now
Hey
Put on your red dress
And then you go downtown now
I said buy yourself a shotgun now
We're gonna break it down baby now
We're gonna load it up baby now
And then you shoot him for he run now
I said shotgun
Shoot 'em for he run now
Do the jerk baby
Do the jerk now
Hey
Shotgun
Shoot 'em for he run now
Do the jerk baby
Do the jerk now
Hey
Put on your high heel shoes
I said were gonna go down here listen to 'em play the blues
We're gonna dig potatoes
We're gonna pick tomatoes
I said shotgun
Shoot 'em for he run now
Do the jerk baby
Do the jerk now
Hey
I said it's twine time
I said it's twine time
I said it's twine time
Hey wailin' out the blues
