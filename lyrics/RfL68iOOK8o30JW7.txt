Shirueto ya kage ga kakumei o meteiru
Mo tengoku no giu no kaidan wa nai

Silhouettes and shadows watch
the revolution
No more free steps to heaven
It's no game

Ore genjitsu kara shime dasare
Nani ga okkote iru ka wakara nai
Doko ni kyokun wa aruka
Hitobito wa yabi oorareteiru
Konna dokusaisha ni igashima rareru nowa
kanashi

I am barred from the event
I really don't understand the situation
And it's no game

Documentaries on refugees
Couples 'gainst the target
They throw the rock against the road
And it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday
And it's all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain
And it makes all the papers

Shinbun wa kaki tateru

Nammmino kiroku eiga
Hioteki o se ni koibi to tach
Michi ni ishi o nage reba
Konago na mi kudake
Kino ni hutao sureba
Kyohu wa masu
Ore no atama ni tama o buchi kome ba
Shinbun wa kaki tateru

So where's the moral when people have their
fingers broken
To be insulted by these fascists - it's so
degrading
And it's no game

SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
