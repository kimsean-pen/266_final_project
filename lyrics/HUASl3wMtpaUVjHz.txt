There's a woman crying out tonight
Her world has changed
She asks God why
Her only son has died and now her daughter cries
She can't sleep at night
Downtown another day for all the suits and ties
Another war to fight, there's no regard for life
How do they sleep at night?
How can we make things right?
Just wanna make this right

We believe (we believe)
We believe (we believe)
We believe (we believe)
In this love

We are all the same
Human in all our ways and all our pain
(So let it be) There's a love that could fall down like rain
(Let us see) Let forgiveness wash away the pain
(What we need?) And no one really knows what they are searching for
(We believe) This world is crying for so much more

We believe (we believe)
We believe (we believe)
We believe (we believe)
In this love
We believe (we believe)
We believe (we believe)
We believe
In this love

So this world
Is too much for you to take
Just lay it down and follow me
I'll be everything you need
In every way

We believe (we believe)
We believe (we believe)
We believe (we believe)
In this love, in this love
We believe (in this love)
We believe (in this love)
We believe in this love
