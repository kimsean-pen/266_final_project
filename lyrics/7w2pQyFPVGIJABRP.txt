I feel a separation coming on
'Cause I know you want to be moving on
I wish it would snow tonight
You'd pull me in, avoid a fight
'Cause I feel a separation coming on

Just prove that there is nothing left to try
'Cause the truth, I'd rather we just both deny
You kissed me with those open eyes
That says so much, it's no surprise to you
But I've got something left to say

Don't surrender, surrender, surrender
Please remember, remember December
We were so in love back then
Now you're listening
To what they say
Don't go that way
Remember, remember December
Please remember
Don't surrender

You said that you wouldn't let them change your mind
'Cause when we're together fire melts the ice
Our hearts are both on overdrive
Come with me, let's run tonight
Don't let these memories get left behind

Don't surrender, surrender, surrender
Please remember, remember December
We were so in love back then
Now you're listening
To what they say
Don't go that way
Remember, remember December
Please remember

I remember us together
With the promise of forever
We can do this, fight the pressure
Please remember December

Don't surrender, surrender, surrender
Please remember, remember December
We were so in love back then
Now you're listening
To what they say
Don't go that way
Remember, remember December
Please remember
Don't surrender
