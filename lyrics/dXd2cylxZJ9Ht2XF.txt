Waving from the ocean liner
The native Indians behind that

Rock, rock and roll
Plymouth rock, roll over
Rock, rock and roll
Plymouth rock, roll over

Ribbon of concrete
Just see what you done done
To the church of the American Indian

Once upon the Sandwich Isles
The social structure steamed upon Hawaii

Rock, rock and roll
Plymouth rock, roll over
Rock, rock and roll
Plymouth rock, roll over

Bicycle rider
Just see what you've done
To the church of the American Indian

Wa halla loo lay

Keeny wok a poo lah
Wa halla loo lay
Wa halla loo lah
Keeny wok a poo lah
Wa halla loo lay
Wa halla loo lah
Keeny wok a poo lah
Wa halla loo lay
Wa halla loo lah
Keeny wok a poo lah

Rock, rock and roll
Plymouth rock, roll over
Rock, rock and roll
Plymouth rock, roll over
