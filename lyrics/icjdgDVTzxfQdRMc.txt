Some of us were never contemplating
Or isolating rationality,
Some of us were never born the same,
We might somehow have been so ignored by this.
In many other times you've been my faith
I maybe often found you made my world make sense
Have many of my scars become my pain
Are many more to come
In maybe some other life
You've given me the chance to walk away near
I'm so alone in me, oh, never want to tell
You're bringing me the chance to complicate things
I'm so lost in this, oh, never want to spare
How am I supposed to heal you
And reach your love and reach your love
How am I supposed to keep you?
And reach your love
Remembering those times when you were never safe
You're trapped in all the shadows of your pain
But sadly you were never back the same way
I've always tried to bring you life again
How am I supposed to heal you
How am I supposed to reach you
And reach your love and reach your love however...
And reach your love and reach your love forever
