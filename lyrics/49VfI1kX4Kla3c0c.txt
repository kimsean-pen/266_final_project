Once I gave all I had to give
And I gave it all proudly
Once they took all one can take
And so they took my body gladly
Some say it's wrath
Some it's survival
And as all travelers I never was
Longing for arrival

Once we lived
And tore the world from its sleep
Once we lived and got
All hearts to bleed
And now you find it can't be done
But once we fought
And took it to the street
Once we fought and planted the seed

And yet you're trying now to govern

Once you gave all you had to give
And you gave it all proudly
Once they took all they could take
And they took you all so gladly
But your logic is faulty
Your fears shine through
You still got the hate

But not the heart
And I'm done with you

Once we lived
And tore the world from its sleep
Once we lived and got
All hearts to beat
And now you find it can't be done
But once we fought

And took it to the streets
Once we fought and planted the seed
And yet you're trying now to govern

Jetzt erst beginnt
Die wahrhaft grosse Zeit...
...Es gilt zur Tat zu schreiten.
Zur Tat!

Oh, but once we lived
And tore the world from its sleep
Once we lived
And we planted the seed
And you will find we are not done
For some still burn
Some hearts still bleed
For some still burn
Some hearts still bleed
And you will find
We can't be governed
We won't be governed
We won't be governed
