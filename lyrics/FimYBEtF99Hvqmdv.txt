Home is where the haunt is
Those wounds won't lick themselves
So good thing you're not alone
He's been here all along
You can't see him, but you know he's there

The ghost in the corner of the room
Knows what you sleep in
When you're dreaming and of who
Some things never change
Maybe that's okay

Home is where the haunt is
The past still present tense
Need more time to mourn
But you shouldn't sulk for too long
Because you look like hell
An accidental version of yourself

You can't just forget all the other lives you've lived

The ghost in the corner of the room
Knows how you're feeling
'Cause you're dead to him, too
Some things never change
Maybe that's okay

'Cause I know how you hate to sleep alone
