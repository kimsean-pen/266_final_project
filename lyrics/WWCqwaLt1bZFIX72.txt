Looking up staring through the sky
Finding ourselves out in the night
Losing it all just to feel right
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Never know what it feels like
Unless you learn to, just to feel right
Just to feel right, learn just to feel right...

Losing it all just to feel right
Feel right, feel right, feel right
Just to feel right...

Losing it all just to feel right
Never know what it feels like...
