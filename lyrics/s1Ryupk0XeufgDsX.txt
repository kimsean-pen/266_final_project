Cause mom said
I'd be crossing borders
Never be afraid even
when you're cornered
Stand up straight, fight your way
Fight your way, fight your way

All these people here
staring and looking at me
Shaking their heads eyes
down strong on me
What's wrong with me?
Can you tell me now?
What's wrong with me?
Can you tell me now?

The anger, the cruelty, I deserve it
And I'd do anything to
be what they call perfect
Then maybe I could find
a place to call my own and belong
But if only I was strong.

I'll be walking with my eyes down
eyes down, eyes down
I'll keep my eyes down
eyes down, eyes down

'Cause mom said I'd be crossing borders
Never be afraid even when you're cornered
Stand up straight, fight your way
Fight your way, fight your way

Through the borders
Through the borders
Through the borders
Fight your way, fight your way

Through the borders
Through the borders
Through the borders
Fight your way, fight your way

Stand up, fall down, up again
Up against the pressure I am in
Slowly but surely I begin
Jumping trains 'cause I know I can win

Oh fear not 'cause
I know I'm in His hands
Though I can't see
I know there's a plan
So thick the fog but
I know I can trust
The feelings that
I feel when the roads rough

I gotta be tough with my eyes down
eyes down, eyes down
Strong in my stance with my eyes down
eyes down, eyes down

'Cause mom said
I'd be crossing borders
Never be afraid even
when you're cornered
Stand up straight, fight your way
Fight your way, fight your way

Through the borders
Through the borders
Through the borders
Fight your way, fight your way

Through the borders
Through the borders
Through the borders
Fight your way, fight your way

No, I won't play pretend
I can't pretend
There's so much more up ahead
All that's up ahead
No, I won't play pretend
There's so much more ahead

Through the borders
Through the borders
Through the borders
Fight your way, fight your way

Through the borders
Through the borders
Through the borders
Fight your way, fight your way

Through the borders
Through the borders
