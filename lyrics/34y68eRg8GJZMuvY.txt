Wonder on
of holy water
Another drink
another dollar
Hand in the air
A sleeping skin
The man with no face
I bit my tongue
Now can you tell me
if my cup is full
Will I find a way:
To make sense of the way that you love me?
Will I find a way:
To repay you for all that you've done for me?
Laid with gloom
Lady in tears
Can't we stop
a slide to change
with each one ourselves
You can't be sad
for everyone
Another taste
another question
Hand in hand
Will I find a way:
To make sense of the way that you love me?
Will I find a way:
To repay you for all that you've done for me?
Will I find a way:
To make sense of the way that you love me?
Will I find a way:

To repay you for all that you've done for me?

I wait!
Can you wait forever, girl?
"I can wait."
I wait! Can you wait for
I wait!
Can you wait forever, girl?
"I can wait."
I wait! Can you wait for
I wait!
Can you wait forever, girl?
"I can wait."
I wait! Can you wait for
I wait!
Can you wait forever, girl?
"I can wait."
I wait! Can you wait for
