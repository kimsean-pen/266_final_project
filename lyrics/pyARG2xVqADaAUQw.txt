I've used hammers made out of wood
I have played games with pieces and rules
I've deciphered tricks at the bar
But now you're gone
I haven't figured out why
I've come up with riddles
And jokes about war
I've figured out numbers and what they're for
I've understood feelings
And I've understood words
But how could you be taken away?

And wherever you've gone, and wherever we might go
It don't seem fair, today just disappeared
Your light's reflected now, reflected from a far
We were but stones, your light made us stars

With heavy breath awakens regret
Back pages and days that could've been spent
Together, but we're miles apart
Every inch between us becomes light years now
No time to be void or save up on life
You've got to spend it all

And wherever you've gone, and wherever we might go
It don't seem fair, today just disappeared
Your light's reflected now, reflected from a far
We were but stones, your light made us stars
