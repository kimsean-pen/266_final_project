I'm on the IDL
Looking north
Sorrounded by the cold
Nothing more
There's nothing else around
Not for miles
How long have I been here?
For a very long time

Stranded in Greenland

I'm on the IDL
With my gear
I wish I knew how
To get out of here
I'm positive that I'm lost
And it worries me
Ice is floating by
As I look to the east

Stranded in Greenland

I'm looking all-round
But there is know one else around
I'm looking all around
But there is not a single sound
