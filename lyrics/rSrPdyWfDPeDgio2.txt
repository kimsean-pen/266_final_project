Everyone here
In front of me still
Watching the smoke
Lost in the air
The moment appears
Lines that we've drawn
See I'm tryna go
But I'm pretty gone

I'm a stone, I'm a stone in the center of a flame

And it's so hard to be patient
When I'm the only one waiting
I left my heart in the basement
I left my pride on the way in
I want no part in your plan
I got my own, understand
I can hear people walking
I've got my ear to the ground
All the lines that you're saying
Playing a part that you stay in
Until it all turns to stone
And you're all burned out or you're fading
I'm tryna do this alone
I'm tryna do this alone
I got my circle around but
I'm tryna do this alone

I'm a stone, I'm a stone in the center of a flame

I'm a stone
I'm a stone
I'm a stone
I'm a stone

I'm a stone
I'm a stone
I'm a stone
I'm a stone
