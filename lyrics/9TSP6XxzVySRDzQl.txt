I keep my eye on one thing at a time
You just happen to be the one thing this time
Don't you know I'm shit at having friends
They always disappear or I forget
I keep my eye on one thing at a time

What did I do?
How am I to know?
What did I do?
How am I to know?

I keep my mind in one place at a time
And I always leave without saying goodbye
'Cause you know I'm shit at having friends
I'm sorry, I can only do my best
I keep my mind in one place at a time

What did I do?
How am I to know?
What did I do?
How am I to know?

What you want from me is
A better bit of something I can't afford
What you want is not what I'm good for

What did I do?
How am I to know?
What did I do?
How am I to know?
