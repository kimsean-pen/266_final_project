Oh now, it hurts again
'Cause I'm left out;
I believed the promises
Oh how, does it hurt again
I should know now
Better than to believe him

Ooh-ooh, all this sorrow
Ooh-ooh, will be gone tomorrow

And that's my motto
Don't let 'em near enough
To let me down
All this love ever does is
Break me now
And if it hurts so much to stay,
Then let him go
Oh, that's my motto

I'm not a fool
And Lord knows I'll be stupid
If I still wanted you
But if I do
I'll repeat the message till I don't

Ooh-ooh, all this sorrow
Ooh-ooh, will be gone
Tomorrow, morrow, morrow

And that's my motto
Don't let 'em near enough
To let me down
All this love ever does is
Break me now
And if it hurts so much to stay,
Then let him go
And that's my motto

And if you call, oh no,
I won't crawl
Back into your arms,
I fall alone
'Cause I'm better off
Being on my own

And that's my motto
Don't let 'em near enough
To let me down
All this love ever does is
Break me now
And if it hurts so much to stay,
Then let him go
And that's my motto

That's my motto
My motto
That's my motto
