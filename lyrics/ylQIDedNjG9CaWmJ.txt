Let me be alone
Let me dream in silence
And enjoy this cold wonderful night
Let me believe
Make me glad
Let's dance on the water
Let's dance on the water
Let me believe
No human can drown
If you don't expect too much
If you don't expect too much

Let me take you for a walk
Let me see, let me smile
Tell me
No human can drown
If you don't expect too much
And let me take you for a walk
I don't expect too much

Just wanna hold you
Just wanna touch you
Just wanna hold you
Just wanna touch you
And I feel your flesh
Take me in your universe
Hold me
Just hold me
