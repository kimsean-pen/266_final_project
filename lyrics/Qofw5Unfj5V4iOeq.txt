The misfits high in this night
Can feel the presence of death
Way to the mortuary
So the dead's invoke
Corpses and skulls in my contour
See a corpse blood
With the face in cruciform
Now begins for the wrath

Catch the skulls of a children
Frozen and dismal
Coming with me, creature
Kill in name of Hell
The black mass is started
Life's will terminate
With the wrath of the demons
Started the genocide

Wrath in my corpus is born
Death – Lost legions from Hell
Slaughter – You'll see in sacrifice
Skulls are christians with blood

Necromancer
Dead's invoker
Necromancer
Dead's invoker

Wrath, odious desire
In my corpus is born
The fate's last terror is spread
For a necros creature of crypts

The misfits high in this night
Can feel the presence of death
Way to the mortuary
So the dead's invoke
Corpses and skulls in my contour
See a corpse blood
With the face in cruciform
Now begins for the wrath
