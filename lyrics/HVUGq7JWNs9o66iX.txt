Oh, my love
You been crying, oh, honey, baby, please
We can work it out
I can't survive unless you're next to me

And all my life
Before I met you, when I was trying hard in love
I thought the sun
Was going down, but the sun was comin' up

All those others
That I stayed with, their eyes are polished stone
And all my devils
That I made deals with so I wouldn't have to sleep alone

And all my life
Before I met you, when I was trying hard in love
I thought the sun
Was going down, but the sun was comin' up

I see your face
In the window, I see your face in the reflections of the [?]
I feel my own
Ancients shadows disappear when I am near to you
So take this heart
Take this feeling, take my dark and reeling mind
From these pores
Find a meaning far deep within these clumsy lives

And all my life
Before I met you, when I was trying hard in love
I thought the sun
Was going down, but the sun was comin' up
I thought the sun
Was going down, but the sun was comin' up
