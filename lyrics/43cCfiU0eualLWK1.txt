I was on my way back home
When I stumbled upon
A forest of purest green
I couldn't look away

There was a shining light so bright
I couldn't look away
In Friedrich's little forest
He's waiting there for us

To grow there was a door to something so pure
A spark was there waiting for someone like me
(Someone so far from home)

I found a window water like crystal
The clearest thing I've seen
I couldn't look away
It's Friedrich's little forest
He's waiting there for us to come
