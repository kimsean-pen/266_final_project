How'd you think I feel when you call my name?
You got me confused, by the way I've changed
How'd you think I feel, when you call my name?
My name, say my name baby

It's a love you save for the way I know we've been apart
It's an endless circle a poison arrow to my heart (heart)
Singing I,
I love what you do to me, need you to stay with me
I, I love you too much to let go

How'd you think I feel, when you call my name?
You've got me confused, by the way I've changed
How'd you think I feel, when you call my name
My name, say my name baby
How'd you think I feel, when you call my name?
You got me confused, by the way I've changed
How'd you think I feel, when you call my name?
My name, say my name baby

It's the constant thought, of my baby taking up my time (time)
It's the non stop vision of you that's playing on my mind (mind)
Singing I...,
I love what you do to me, need you to stay with me

I, I love you too much to let go
How'd you think I feel, when you call my name?
You've got me confused, by the way I've changed
How'd you think I feel, when you call my name?
My name, say my name baby
How'd you think I feel, when you call my name?
You got me confused, by the way I've changed
How'd you think I feel, when you call my name?
My name, say my name baby

When you call my name
When you call my name
Say my name baby
When you call my name
When you call my name
Say my name baby
