Watch winter melt away
Look for longer days the sun comes out
Come up from underground
Stop covering your eyes
Wasting precious time on yesterdays
It's written on your face
But you've got time
You've got time

Change comes for you even if you're hiding out
So wake to this truth and maybe you'll believe me now

Whatever lies ahead
The things that we have said will slowly fade
Nothing can remain
Feel darkness and the light
Wrestle in your mind you know it's there
It's always been right there
And you've got time
You've still got time

Change comes for you even if you're hiding out
So wake to this truth and maybe you'll believe me now
No safety in illusions of a place where you belonged
So take hold of me and hang on 'til the hurt is gone
The hurt is gone
Yea it's gone

Change comes for you even if you're hiding out
So wake to this truth and maybe you'll believe me now
No safety in illusions of a place where you belonged
So take hold of me and hang on 'til the hurt is gone
The hurt is gone
Yea it's gone
