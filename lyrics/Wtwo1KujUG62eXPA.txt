If our world falls down tomorrow
You be sure I'll be there with a net
To catch the pieces falling
And I was always there
And I was always there
I was always there but you
Just never knew where

(ay oh, ay oh) I hope you weren't waiting long
I hope this night makes up for time lost
(ay oh, ay oh) Feels like I met you years ago and
We're picking up right where we left off

I've considered what I'd be like if the ocean poured in
From both of the coasts
And we set sail to find out
Just where our boat would go

But I dont think I'd want to know
'Cause it would just make time
So I could see your smile
With our brand new life in tow

(ay oh, ay oh) I hope you weren't waiting long
I hope this night makes up for time lost
(ay oh, ay oh) Feels like I met you years ago and
We're picking up right where we left off

And if I'm on the road for
Another thousand years or so
I hope you know a part of me's at home
And I traded brick for straw in
The house I built around my heart,
So when you came, it wouldn't be so tough,
Just huff and puff this manly bluff.

(ay oh, ay oh) I hope you weren't waiting long
I hope this night makes up for time lost
(ay oh, ay oh) Feels like I met you years ago and
We're picking up right where we left off
