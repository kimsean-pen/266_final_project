Stand back, watching this unfold
I just can't believe you don't
See that you are way too good potentially
This heat, never growing cold
Heartbeat pounding in my throat
Don't speak, I just want your hands on me, finally

My mama said, It's just cabaret
But baby, I don't care, to me you're Bowie
Let's climb to the top
Yeah, let's bring them up to speed

I know it's love actually-y-y-y
I know we're gonna be free, free, free, free
I know it's love actually-y-y-y
You're way too good for me-e-e-e

I know it's love, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
I know it's love, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
I know it's love

See, my dress is on the floor
Fuck like it's never done before
Maybe this is way too good essentially
This high, never going low
Still not, when you gotta go
White lies, is this only real for me, honestly?

My mama said, It's just cabaret
But baby, I don't care, to me you're Bowie
Let's climb to the top
Yeah, let's bring them up to speed

I know it's love actually-y-y-y
I know we're gonna be free, free, free, free
I know it's love actually-y-y-y
You're way too good for me-e-e-e

I know it's love, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
I know it's love, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
I know it's love

You mess with my head
I'm missing my bed
But baby, I don't care you just changed the spread
You know I don't fake
I love when you take the lead

I know it's love actually-y-y-y
I know we're gonna be free, free, free, free
I know it's love actually-y-y-y
You're way too good for me-e-e-e

I know it's love, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
I know it's love, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
I know it's love

Actually-y-y-y
Gonna be free, free, free, free
I know it's love
