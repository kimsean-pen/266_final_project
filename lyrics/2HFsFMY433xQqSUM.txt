Are you sick of me?
Would you like to be?
I'm tryna tell you something

Something that I already said
You like a pretty boy
With a pretty voice
Who's trying to sell you something
Something that you already have

But if you're too drunk to drive,
And the music is right
She might let you stay
But just for the night
And if she grabs for your hand
And drags you along
She might want a kiss
Before the end of the song
Because love, can burn like a cigarette
And leave you with nothing
And leave you with nothing

While the others talk
We were listening to lovers rock
In her bedroom, in her bedroom
And if you start to kiss
And the record skips
Flip it over and sit a little closer

But if you too drunk to drive
And the music is right
She might let you stay
But just for the night
And if she grabs for your hand
And drags you along
She might want a kiss
Before the end of the song
Because love, can burn like a cigarette
And leave you with nothing
And leave you with nothing
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do,
Because love,
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do,
Can burn like a cigarette
And leave you with nothing
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do,
And leave you with nothing
