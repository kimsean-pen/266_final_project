If I fall
Down on my knees
Wondering for
What we could be

If I could
Try a little harder
I would succeed(oh oh)
I'd rather give up
and be happy

I will come home
I will come home
I will come home in time
I will go home back in part
It's all I'm told, you've found the sun
Oh, with our sleighs apart

If I could
Try a little harder
I could succeed
I'd rather give up
and be happy

I will come home in time
I will go home back in part
It's all I'm told, you've found the sun
Oh, with our sleighs apart

I will come home in time
I will go home back in part
It's all I'm told, you've found the sun
Oh, with our sleighs apart
