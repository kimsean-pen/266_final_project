Looking at your watch a third time waiting in the station for a bus.
Going to a place that's far, so far away and if that's not enough.
Going where nobody says hello, they don't talk to anybody they don't know.

You'll wind up in some factory that's full time filth and nowhere left to go.
Walk home to an empty house, sit around all by yourself.
I know it might sound strange but I believe you'll be coming back before too long.

Don't go back to Rockville.
Don't go back to Rockville.
Don't go back to Rockville and waste another year.

At night I drink myself to sleep and pretend I don't care that you're not here with me.
Cause it's so much easier to handle all my problems if I'm too far out to sea
But something better happen soon or it's gonna be too late to bring you back.

Don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville.
Don't go back to Rockville and waste another year.

It's not as though I really need you.
If you were here I'd only bleed you.
But everybody else in town only wants to bring you down
And that's not how it ought to be.

I know it might sound strange but I believe you'll be coming back before too long.

Don't go back to Rockville.
Don't go back to Rockville.
Don't go back to Rockville and waste another year.

Don't go back to Rockville.
Don't go back to Rockville.
Don't go back to Rockville and waste another year.
