Pressure, pressure
On my veins
Pleasure, pleasure
Turns to pain
Look what you have done
I know I can't run

Don't hold my hand
Just hold me down
Don't kiss my lips
Just hold me down
Don't be my friend
Just hold me down
Don't lift me up
Just hold me down

Fragile, fragile
To the bone
Agile, agile
Hurry home
You've broken me down
I'm on safer ground

Don't hold my hand
Just hold me down
Don't kiss my lips
Just hold me down
Don't be my friend
Just hold me down
Don't lift me up
Just hold me down
