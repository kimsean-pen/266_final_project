She'll be gone soon
You can have me for yourself

She'll be gone soon
You can have me for yourself

But do give
Just give me today
Or you will just scare me away

What we build is bigger
Than the sum of two

What we build is bigger
Than the sum of two

But somewhere i was count on my own And somehow i must find it alone

24 and blooming like the fields of maine 25 and yearning for a ticket out

Dreams burn but in ashes are gold Dreams burn but in ashes are gold
