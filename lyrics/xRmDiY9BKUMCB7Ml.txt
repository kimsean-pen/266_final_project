Break out again
You start to feel
It's all pretend
This time it's real

Body starts to give in
Try to keep your eyes open
This is where you breathe in
Right now you're one of us

Wolves in our own skin
We're savages
We act so primitive
We're savages
Do the rain dance
Like you're on fire
Like you're on fire
We're savages

Shape shift begin
You've lost the fear
You've found a friend
You're safe in here

Body starts to give in
Try to keep your eyes open
This is where you breathe in
Right now you're one of us

Wolves in our own skin
We're savages
We act so primitive
We're savages
Do the rain dance
Like you're on fire
Like you're on fire
We're savages

This is happening
We are savages
This is happening
We are savages

Wolves in our own skin
We're savages
We act so primitive
We're savages
Do the rain dance
Like you're on fire
Like you're on fire
We're savages

This is happening
We are savages
This is happening
We are savages
