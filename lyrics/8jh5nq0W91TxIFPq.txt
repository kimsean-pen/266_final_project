Under fears you restore your beliefs,
Like an old man in church on a Sunday,
All the dirt on your elbows and knees,
Any minute you know you could die.

So come save us, turn water to wine,
Give me words, of unfathomable wisdom,
As I'm crossing the enemy's line,
Where the wounded and dead show the way.

(Show me the way)

Tell me when the night is gone,
Like washed away,
Make a wish beneath the mourning star.

How could there be a reason for war?
For the life of a human that suffers
I remember, I heard it before,
Tell me all when the new day begins.

(The new day begins)

Tell me when the night is gone,
Like washed away,
Make a wish beneath the mourning star.
When the victory is won,
The old clich,
Underneath the same old mourning star.

(Why, please tell me why,
you gave, the world all this pain)

Tell me when the night is gone,
Like washed away,
Make a wish beneath the mourning star.
When the victory is one,
The old clich,
Underneath the same old mourning star.
