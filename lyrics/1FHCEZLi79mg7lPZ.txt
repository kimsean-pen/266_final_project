You presume I'm weak, you presume I'm frail
But your presumptions won't prevail
I'm made of more than what you see

You tell me to twist, tell me to bend
But I won't break just to fit in
Just shut your mouth and listen up

I was so naive to let you have control of me
But now that I believe in me, I know

You're wrong, and I'm strong
Unafraid I'm moving on
'Cause I'm free to be me
Nobody tells me who to be

You're wrong, and I'm strong
Unafraid I'm moving on
'Cause I'm free to be me
Nobody tells me who to be, yeah

I'm on the outside looking in
No longer do I pretend
To be something that I'm not, yeah

I don't run and I don't hide
Behind a comfort in disguise
What you see is what you get

I was so naive to let you have control of me
But now that I believe in me, I know

That you're wrong and I'm strong
Unafraid I'm moving on
'Cause I'm free to be me
Nobody tells me who to be

You're wrong and I'm strong
Unafraid I'm moving on
'Cause I'm free to be me
Nobody tells me who to be, yeah

I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause life is how you grow
You live, you learn and then you know

That you're wrong and I'm strong
Unafraid I'm moving on
'Cause I'm free to be me
Nobody tells me who to be

'Cause you're wrong and I'm strong
Unafraid I'm moving on
'Cause I'm free to be me
Nobody tells me who to be

'Cause you're wrong and I'm strong
Unafraid I'm moving on
'Cause I'm free to be me
Nobody tells me who to be

'Cause you're wrong and I'm strong
Unafraid I'm moving on
'Cause I'm free to be me
Nobody tells me who to be, yeah
