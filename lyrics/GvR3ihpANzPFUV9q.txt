We should go to sleep now, You should stay the night
I'll be up to watch the world around us live and die
Lying on the grass now, dancing for the stars
Maybe one will look on down and tell us who we are
We might fall, we might fall, we might fall, Hallie we might fall
We might fall, we might fall, we might fall, Hallie we might fall
I could join the circus, and you could sell your hair
I could learn to walk the line or learn to train the bears
Tell me are we crazy, did you like the cold
Tell me are you comfortable if comfortable at all

We might fall, we might fall, we might fall, Hallie we might fall
We might fall, we might fall, we might fall, Hallie, we might fall
Now that we are older, I remember you. Reaching out to show me all the things that I must do
Now that we are older, I remember youth, now that we are close to death and close to finding truth
We might fall, we might fall, we might fall, Hallie we might fall
We might fall, we might fall, we might fall, Hallie we might fall
Sha-la la, sha-la-la, sha-la-la oh hey now
Sha-la-la, sha-la-la, sha-la-la,
oh hey we might fall, hey now, fall
