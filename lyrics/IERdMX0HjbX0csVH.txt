Halloween is signal I received in France
watching all the traffic going by
your hair is done in sequins you wear leather pants
soldiers at the crossroads wave goodbye

and it's already over in October
already Christmas every year
always good to sing when you are sober
always good to wipe away a tear

sometimes I think we'll all go up in smoke
owing that the passage is not clear
there is a man who probably will choke
on the words that sound so violently sincere

and it's already over in October
already Christmas every year
always good to sing when you are sober
always good to wipe away a tear

there was a woman wore my ring upon her hand
warning me to judge the way I feel
right on surface of everything I planned
she cut to deep to ever really heal

and it's already over in October
already Christmas every year
always good to sing when you are sober
always good to wipe away a tear

I see you I'll nod to some passing face of God
who never really answer me at prayer
the savior is quite odd he prefers the prod
his kingdom is near but the thin air
