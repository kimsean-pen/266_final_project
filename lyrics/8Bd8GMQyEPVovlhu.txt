Yeah
(Okay) Yeah (Okay) yeah

Hold up, I don't think they 'bout it, yeah (Ayy)
I just need a cute ass chick to put up with my habits, yeah
I come prepared every week, roll up with some backups, yeah
I double book, I triple book these dates in case they acting up
I'm so petty, she get shook, unfollow her, I'm ghost (I'm ghost)
If I'm not her one and only, get what I want then I bolt (I bolt)
You acting like I got dope, y'all been dumb, I know I been it
I've been grinding for a minute, no more games, this time I get it
All my income spent on business, yeah, yeah
I get caught up chasing women, yeah, yeah
On hiatus, so I'll end it, yeah, yeah
Ain't no doubt, it's time I get it, yeah, yeah

Won't take that back, I said it, then I meant it
Pushed so hard, well, now we winning
My blood, sweat, my tears, I'm driven, yeah
I just return, never left
I just return, never left
I just return, never left, woo
Won't take that back, I said that, then I meant it
Pushed so hard, well, now we winning
My blood, sweat, my tears, I'm driven, yeah, ayy
I just return, never left
I just return, never left
I just return, never left, yeah

I just tell 'em what it is, I'm about the biz
If that girl too close to me, I'm sorry, gotta drift
Almost famous, got a glimpse, got the flame, I got the hits
I swear my roommates all slay too much, we all be modern pimps
From a small town so I changed the script that I got
She says she never done this before, I get that a lot
Only gettin' better, checking every album I've dropped
I turn aggression into progression, I'm benchin' a lot
I'm in that cut, I be on my grind, I be in the hunt
Want a lowkey chick, forget a slut, y'all just suck
Y'all the same, got no brain
L.A. hoes never change
Cougars love me, doubt my age
That don't stop 'em, I'm to blame, yeah

Won't take that back, I said it, then I meant it
Pushed so hard, well, now we winning
My blood, sweat, my tears, I'm driven, yeah
I just return, never left
I just return, never left
I just return, never left, woo
Won't take that back, I said that, then I meant it
Pushed so hard, well, now we winning
My blood, sweat, my tears, I'm driven, yeah, ayy
I just return, never left
I just return, never left
I just return, never left, yeah
