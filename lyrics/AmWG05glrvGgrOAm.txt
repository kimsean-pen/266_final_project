Over lord hills bridge we must go

Where the hearts burn at night and the guns unload
Oceanographers are charting the rise of the seas
Today is a submarine
Setting course to a land under me

Nature springs are lost in a war
The imperious demands are the local law
It is pulling us down to the emperor's gate

Everyone's a submarine
Looking for a dream far away
