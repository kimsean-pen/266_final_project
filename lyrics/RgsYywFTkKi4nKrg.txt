if I could keep
this moment here
live away
get away

and now I feel you
cross my heart
shining shining
like a jewel

ooh
put me high on a wall
and let's not fall
let's not fall

sweet dreams I remember it all
I remembered it all

doo te doo...

if I could keep this hour
and hold you gently next to me
it would sparkle like a jewel
and all this means so much to me

you know it's gone
it's gone to fast
wish you could never be a past
but then i'll ... much more to lose
alone and screaming
eo eo eo...

to doo te doo...
eo...
to doo te doo
