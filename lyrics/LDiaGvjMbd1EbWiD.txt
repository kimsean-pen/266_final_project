Shame marries the guilt
Introduces itself to the concept of total loneliness
Sensations repressed
Make friends with suicidia
And here the leeches begin to suck away the lust for life

Escape takes lead into a world unknown
Uncontrolled by all
Where borders are erased and potential infinite
Chosen cells, glands and transmittors
Blast the body with joy
Astral feet running up
To dimensions covered with gold
Stairs of glowing electroplasma
Safir onyx, and buzzing vibrations
A dead men's banquet
Food for the gods

There's only one real world
Our Earth is but a shadow
Created from a child's heart, a living jewel
From now on abode for a soul in its setting

Escape takes lead into a world unknown
Uncontrolled by all
Where borders are erased and potential infinite
Chosen cells, glands and transmittors
Blast the body with joy
Astral feet running up
To dimensions covered with gold
Stairs of glowing electroplasma
Safir onyx, and buzzing vibrations
A dead men's banquet
Food for the gods

Cutting the bloodline
Re-tie the bleeding roots
To heavenly ship of glass
And let it drift in passive arrogance
In a one-word dialogue with the stars

Escape takes lead into a world unknown
Uncontrolled by all
Where borders are erased and potential infinite
Chosen cells, glands and transmittors
Blast the body with joy
Astral feet running up
To dimensions covered with gold
Stairs of glowing electroplasma
Safir onyx, and buzzing vibrations
A dead men's banquet
Food for the gods
