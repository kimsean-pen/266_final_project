Lazy days calling to you
Come out to play, the future lies with you
Now you can be sure love is the cure
What we're searching for is to have
A jolly good time

Crazy days but you'll get me through
And here I'll stay holding on to you
Now you can be sure our thought's unpure
Will unlock the door and we will have
A jolly good time

It can happen in any season
We don't need any reason to sit around and wait
The world can change in a second, so
I find the sunshine beckons me
To open up the gate and dream and dream

Lazy days, don't let them get you down
Wear your smile, I don't want to see you frown
Don't let them get you down

It can happen in any season
We don't need any reason to sit around and wait
The world can change in a second, so
I find the sunshine beckons me
To open up the gate and dream and dream
Then we will have a jolly good time
Time, time, time
