The rich man poor man beggar man thief
Everyone claim that them are the chief
The rich man buy the poor man's life
The poor man take away the beggar man's wife

Don't cry my brothers
Don't cry my sisters

Tears won't change the situation
It's just a form, a form of reaction

If you step on fire, fire burn you
If you play with puppy, puppy lick your mouth
So stand up strong, you got to know where you belong,
Say the weak ones now will soon become strong

Hey, everything will soon be okay
As soon as the war is over
Jah children will be free to come over
Singing and dancing ready to take over
Have some faith, have a little faith

Hey, everything will soon he okay
As soon as the war is over
Jah children will be free to come over
Singing and dancing ready to take over
Have some faith, have a little faith...
