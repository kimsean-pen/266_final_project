See
See far, far deeper than the mind's eye
Hear far, far deeper than the inner voice
Feel far, far deeper than the beating heart

Costume change is all we ask
But still we are the same
From a pitch black centre
From a pitch black centre

The lighthouse turns onto an ocean ablaze
What is this?
What is this?

Speak

(Speak far, far clearer than the open mouth)
Breathe, far, far clearer than the winter sky
Dream, far, far clearer than Orion's crown

From there we get no sympathy
But love's a wine dark sea
Rich and moving
Rich and moving

The shock of life
I saw you age but not
What is this?
Is this a kiss?

See far, far deeper than the mind's eye
Hear far, far deeper than the inner voice
Feel far, far deeper than the hand of time
