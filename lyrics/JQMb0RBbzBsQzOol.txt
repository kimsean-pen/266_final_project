Where's your head at?

Where's your head at?
(Where's your head at? Where's your head at?)

Where's your head at?

(Where's your head at? Where's your head at?)

(Drop it)
(Ok I'm ready)
Where's your head at?
(Where's your head at? Where's your head at?)
Where's your head at?
(Where's your head at? Where's your head at?)
Don't let the walls cave in on you
We can't live on, live on without you
Don't let the walls cave in on you
We can't live on, live on without you
Don't let the walls cave in on you
You get what you give that much is true
Don't let the walls cave in on you
You turn the world away from you
Where's your head at?
(Where's your head at? Where's your head at?)
Where's your head at?
(Where's your head at? Where's your head at?)
You have now found yourself trapped in the incomprehensible maze
Where's your head at, you'll know how to be
Where's your head at, you don't make it easy on yourself
Where's your head at, what you give is what you get, is what you get
Where's your head at...
Where's your head at?

(Where's your head at? Where's your head at?)
Where's your head at?
(Where's your head at? Where's your head at?)

Don't let the walls cave in on you
We can't live on, live on without you
Don't let the walls cave in on you
We can't live on, live on without you
Don't let the walls cave in on you
We can't live on, live on without you
Don't let the walls cave in on you
We can't live on, live on without you
(Where's your head at?)
(Where's your head at?)
We can't live on, live on without you
We can't live on, live on without you
We can't live on, live on without you
We can't live on, live on without you
