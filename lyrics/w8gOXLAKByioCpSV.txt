Big Man
Throwing his weight around like an ape
The aliens and the heartbreak
Evil
The privileged prick got to make us his bitches
And we lap it up, give us a second cup

As far as the eye can see
The guts and the grind wrapped in apathy
It's a miracle
That we made it here

As far as the eye can see
The paralyzed giving their lives up for free
Unbelievable
That we made it here

On tip toes
Jailed by the herds and hung by the rope of fear
How did we get here?
Darlings
The boys with their toys are bringing the void our way
For the infinite rainy day, hooray

As far as the eye can see
The guts and the grind wrapped in apathy
It's a miracle
That we made it here

As far as the eye can see
The paralyzed giving their lives up for free
Unbelievable
That we made it here
