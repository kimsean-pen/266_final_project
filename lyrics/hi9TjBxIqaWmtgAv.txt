Past five in the morning
Feeling worse for the weather it seems
But what a feeling
What an endless night this has been

And we can't stay here
'Cause we won't be forever young
Well, have to go down
Before innocence is lost

And I dream you're with me
You hold me sweetly
And rock me gently to sleep
In your arms

I've been getting used to all the crying
And the games that you play
And if I carry on I'm gonna end up with a
Hole in my head

And there's more to life
Thrills and spills and dollar bills
You have to come through
Some way somehow

And I dream I'm with you
You hold me sweetly
And rock me gently to sleep
In your arms

I dream you're with me
You hold me sweetly
And rock me gently to sleep
In your arms

And I dream I'm with you
You hold me sweetly
And rock me gently to sleep
In your arms

I dream you're with me
You hold me sweetly
And rock me gently to sleep
In your arms
