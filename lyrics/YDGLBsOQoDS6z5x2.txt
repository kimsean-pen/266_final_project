Mama told me not to get involved
But I never did what I was told
Always drawn into the golden light
And it would happen every single night
Carry on, carry on, carry on

We were living by the marble rule
Never talking to the jakes or turning up at school
And I'd pretend that I was fine enough
That I was never giving up
Carry on, carry on, carry on

And I saw my devil closing in
Never thought I'd do such a bad thing
You saved me though, little by little love
And I try so hard to bury that stuff
Never thought I'd get so fucked up
You saved me though, little by little love, little by little love

Misbehaviour, clocking up reports
Where's your manners, where's the things you're taught
I say "What's your business with the things I do?"
You say "Boy, if you only had a clue"
Carry on, carry on, carry on
All them years of never thinking straight
In my own way I was a lightweight
All my demons came whispering
Telling me carry on, carry on, carry on

And I saw my devil closing in
Never thought I'd do such a bad thing
You saved me though, little by little love
And I try so hard to bury that stuff
Never thought I'd get so fucked up
You saved me though, little by little love, little by little love

Little by little love, little by little love
Little by little love
And I saw my devil closing in
Never thought I'd do such a bad thing
You saved me though, little by little love
And I try so hard to bury that stuff
Never thought I'd get so fucked up
You saved me though, little by little love, little by little love

Little by little love, little by little love
Little by little love, little by little love
Little by little love, little by little love
Little by little love, little by little love
Little by little love, little by little love
