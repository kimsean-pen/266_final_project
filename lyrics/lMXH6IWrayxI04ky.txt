Is my life not all that I thought it would be?
Is it simply ordinary?
Oh, is it far from all my fantasies?

I lay awake
I lay awake at night and brood
About the things I never do
And how I'm missing out on love and truth

Love and truth
Why are they so hard to achieve
Love and truth
They're such hot commodities
But come in such small quantities
Love and truth where are you?

I dance
I go out on the town and dance
I go and try to find romance
But all I come home is with empty hands
Oh, boo, hoo, hoo
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, cha-chagrin
But all I really want is love and truth

Oh, love and truth
Why is it that I cannot find these sweet delights
Oh, love and truth
If everything was up to me
I'd make sure that there was plenty of love and truth
Love and truth where are you?
