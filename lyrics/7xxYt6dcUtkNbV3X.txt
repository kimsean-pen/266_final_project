You remind me of the babe
(What babe?)
Babe with the power
(What power?)

Power of voodoo
(Who do?)
You do
(Do what?)

Remind me of the babe

I saw my baby
Crying hard as babe could cry
What could I do?
My baby's love had gone

And left my baby blue
Nobody knew

What kind of magic spell to use
What kind of magic spell to use
Thunder or lightning, then baby said

Dance magic, dance (Dance magic, dance)

Dance magic, dance (Dance magic, dance)
Put that baby spell on me

Jump magic, jump (Jump magic, jump)
Jump magic, jump (Jump magic, jump)
Put that magic jump on me

Slap that baby, make him free

I saw my baby
Trying hard as babe could try
What could I do?
My baby's fun had gone

And left my baby blue
Nobody knew

What kind of magic spell to use
(Slime and snails)

Puppy dog tails
(Thunder or lightning)
Then baby said
Dance magic, dance (Dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance (Dance magic, dance)

Put that baby spell on me
Jump magic, jump (Jump magic, jump)
Jump magic, jump (Jump magic, jump)
Put that magic jump on me
Slap that baby, make him free
Dance magic, dance (Dance magic, dance)

Dance magic, dance (Dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance (Dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance (Dance magic, dance)
Jump magic, jump (Jump magic, jump)

Jump magic, jump (Jump magic, jump)
Put that baby spell on me
(Ooh)
You remind me of the babe

(What babe?)
The babe with the power
(What power?)
Power of voodoo
(Who do?)
You do

(Do what?)
Remind me of the babe
Dance magic, dance, ooh ooh ooh
Dance magic, dance magic, ooh ooh ooh

Dance magic
What kind of magic spell to use
(Slime and snails)
Puppy dog tails
(Thunder or lightning)

Something frightening
Dance magic, dance
Dance magic, dance

Put that baby spell on me
Jump magic, jump
Jump magic, jump
Put that magic jump on me
Slap that baby make him free

Dance magic, dance (Dance magic, dance)
