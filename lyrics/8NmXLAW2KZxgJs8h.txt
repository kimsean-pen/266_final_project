See yourself to the exit
We can't afford to watch you resort to this (Resort to this)
Even hope hides in the shadows

Nothing is real
Color is black, is white, is color blind
Tucking away what's true, what's tangible
Nothing is real
Color is black, is white, is color blind
Tucking away what's true, what's tangible...

You're crashing faster, and there won't be pieces to piece back together this time
Can't you see you're ringing? You're ringing out

This is dissonance
This is dissonance
It's in the quiet of this place (This is dissonance)
That all things come to life (This is dissonance)

All that is real is blurred by your notion of reality
All that is real is blurred by your notion of reality

Nothing is real
Color is black, is white, is color blind
Tucking away what's true, what's tangible
Nothing is real
Color is black, is white, is color blind
Tucking away what's true, what's tangible

You skeptic, you
You believe in unbelief
You skeptic, you
Now you're the hypocrite
You can't hide from this
You can't hide from...
You can't hide from this
You can't hide from this
