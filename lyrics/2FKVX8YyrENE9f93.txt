When we were young, we used to live so close to it
And you were scared and you were beautiful
I want to peer over the edge and see in death If we are always the same

Oh, I fear that no love will ever be like this again
Cuz your love kept me alive and it made me insane
There were moments when it seemed okay
(But I go back alone)

so things walk away, do you stay?
(I go back alone)
There was a time when the music would play

Oh, baby, every morning there are mountains to climb
Taking all my time oh, when I get up, this is what I see

Welcome to reality
Oh, baby, every morning there are mountains to climb
Taking all my time oh, when I get up, this is what I see

Welcome to reality
When we were young, we used to live so close to it
And you were scared and you were beautiful

I want to peer over the edge and see in death If we are always the same
There were moments when it seemed okay
(But I go back alone)
so things walk away, do you stay?
(I go back alone)
Oh, baby, every morning there are mountains to climb
Taking all my time oh, when I get up, this is what I see
Welcome to reality
Oh, baby, every morning there are mountains to climb
Taking all my time oh, when I get up, this is what I see
Welcome to reality
Oh, baby, every
(Give me a sign)
Oh, baby, every
Oh, baby, every
(Give me a sign)
Oh, baby, every
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
(Give me a sign)
Oh, baby, every
(Give me a sign)
Oh, baby, every
(Give me a sign)
Oh, baby, every
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, baby, every
