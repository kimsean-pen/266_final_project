Oh, my look at these eyes
Covered in cobwebs, creased like they're alive
So many have tried
To find you inside of there

Oh, my you're a lucky guy
To be so alive in the world
So drowned in a girl
You better look up high
To be so alive in the world
Untouched and arrived

Oh, you're a lucky guy
To be so alive in the world
So drowned in a girl
You better look up high
To be so alive in the world
Untouched and arrived

Oh, my, what do I find
Covered in cobwebs fine
Like they were mine
So many have tried
To find some incentive there

Oh, my you're a lucky guy
To be so alive in the world
So drowned in a girl
You better look up high
To be so alive in the world
Untouched and arrived

Oh, you're a lucky guy
To be so alive in the world
So drowned in a girl
You better look up high
To be so alive in the world
Untouched and arrived

Untouched and arrived
Untouched and arrived
