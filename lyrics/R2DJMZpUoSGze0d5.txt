When the lights go up and the game is on
Are you ready for me 'cause I'm ready for you?
When the bell rings out and the fight is on
Are you ready for me 'cause I'm ready for you?

When the lights go up and the game is on
Are you ready for me 'cause I'm ready for you?
When the bell rings out and the fight is on
Are you ready for me 'cause I'm ready for you?

It's time for us to start throwing down
Take a look and see who's standing now
It's time for us to start throwing down
Look and see who's standing now

Didn't even know that you and I were cross
Until a sneak attack from the weak side
Unaware that we were in a fight
I guess that's part of the problem but guess what?

When the lights go up and the game is on
Are you ready for me 'cause I'm ready for you?
When the bell rings out and the fight is on
Are you ready for me 'cause I'm ready for you?

It's time for us to start throwing down
Take a look and see who's standing now
It's time for us to start throwing down
Look and see who's standing now

Say what you wanna say about me
Throw up what you wanna throw up at me
But when you mess with those that are around me
That's when you and I will have a problem

When the lights go up and the game is on
Are you ready for me 'cause I'm ready for you?
When the bell rings out and the fight is on
Are you ready for me 'cause I'm ready for you?

It's time for us to start throwing down
Take a look and see who's standing now
It's time for us to start throwing down
Look and see who's standing now

I'm not afraid of loving my enemies
Turning the other cheek
Blessing those that would curse me
I honestly want peace with you

But when you come against my country
When you come against my family
You try to destroy my people
I can't just stand by

There's no way that I can stand by
This time I will not stand by
I am coming and if I come
Then pain is coming with me

I'm coming and pain will be with me

When the bell rings out and the fight is on
Are you ready for me 'cause I'm ready for you?

It's time for us to start throwing down
Take a look and see who's standing now
It's time for us to start throwing down
Take a look and see who's standing now

Look and see who's standing now
Look and see who's standing now
Look and see who's standing now
