Coca-Cola dreams, sugar
Don't wake me from this sleep
I'm so in love
I can't believe it's only been seventeen days
I'm losing my shit
Ain't never felt this way

Tell me, babe, is this a bad trip?
Or am I just tweaking on sadness?
Tell me, babe, is this a bad trip?
Or am I just tweaking on
Tweaking on

Will you still love me when I'm all out of drugs?
When I can't get you high
When I can't get you high

Brown ol' Chevrolet
We're sparkling today
But when the smoke, smoke comes flying
Scratch, scratching the hood
Will you keep, keep riding or leave me for good?

Tell me, babe, is this a bad trip?
Or am I just tweaking on sadness?
Tell me, babe, is this a bad trip?
Or am I just tweaking on
Tweaking on

Will you still love me when I'm all out of drugs?
When I can't get you high
When I can't get you high

Ohh, when I can't get you high
(Get you high)
When I can't get you high

Don't stop loving me
Don't stop loving me
Don't stop loving me

Do't stop loving me
Don't stop loving me

Don't stop loving me
Don't stop loving me
Don't you ever stop loving me
Ohh!
Oh baby, don't stop loving me
Don't you dare stop doing that thing, darling
Ohh!
Whoo!

Will you still love me when I'm all out of drugs?
(When I'm out of drugs)
When I can't get you high
When I can't get you high

Ohh, when I can't get you high
When I can't get you high

Will you still love me when I'm all out?
