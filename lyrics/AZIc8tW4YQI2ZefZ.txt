I won't let you die off
Like a suicidal battery
Colored black in the back of a Friday the Thirteenth
Neon sign, dripping poison red, come on!
In fact, the facts are black and white
Stacked and used against us all
Yeah, lacks a sense so uncommon
A difference in opinion that's begging to be forgotten (oh, oh)
'Cause it's rotten
Transaction unsatisfactory (oh)
('Cause it's rotten)
Compassion, an empty battery
They're making sad machines (oh, oh)
Then they turn eighteen
('Cause it's rotten)
Transaction unsatisfactory

I won't let you die off
This isn't that holiday feeling at all
Put away decorations, ugh
Relax on a meditation
Medication stacked
In fact, it's black and white
Stacked and used against us all
It's an abomination revelation
Evolution, revolution

Transaction unsatisfactory (oh, oh, oh)
('Cause it's rotten)
Compassion, an empty battery
They're making sad machines (oh, oh)
Then they turn eighteen
('Cause it's rotten)
Transaction unsatisfactory

Oh, (oh) oh
Oh, (oh) oh

Transaction unsatisfactory (oh, oh, oh)
('Cause it's rotten)
Compassion, an empty battery
They're making sad machines (oh, oh)
Then they turn eighteen
('Cause it's rotten)
Transaction unsatisfactory
Turning the light into something I can bend
(oh, oh)
Into something just to find out that it's worthless in the end
Turning the light into something I can bend
(oh, oh)
Into something just to find out that it's worthless in the end
