With your clover, pickin' cherries
Taking pills and runnin' with the steam
Love's so make believe

Swingin' branches by your mission
And by the Porches, poles and leopard skin
Got you dancin' in

Please, pull the string now
Turn, the winds are runnin' 'round
Oh, if diamonds don't lift dark
Oh, the color's shift and cut

Starin' down at the wonderin' faces
Watch your place
But on the papers you can shine and fly
Smilin' in their eyes

Over land and over space
You take me to that unreal place
That I had ever known
So don't you cry

Please pull the string now
Turn, the winds are runnin' 'round
Oh, diamonds don't lift dark
Oh, the color's shift and cut

Please turn, oh
Please turn, oh, oh
