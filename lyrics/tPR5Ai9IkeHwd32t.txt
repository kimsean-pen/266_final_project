All alone, it's you and me
Time to tell you now just how I feel
Babe, to you I bare my heart
A light of love, here in the dark

Don't you know I might be strong
But deep down there's a sweetness
Only you can touch and make me feel

Oh! What a joy
You're such a perfect lover
Yes, you always know just what to do

Oh, I, I, I need you
Babe you know, you know I do
Oh, I, I, I need you
When the goin' gets rough
You know I do

At the start, I couldn't say
All my feelings I could not portray
But I got to tell you now
That I really need your love, babe
Oh, it's comin' on strong

I feel so secure
When you are here beside me
There is nothin' that can bring me down

Oh, more and more
You take me way up high, babe
And you teach me what love is all about

Oh, I, I, I need you
Babe you know, you know I do
Oh, I, I, I need you
When the goin' gets rough
You know I do, I breakdown

Oh, I, I, I need you
Babe you know, you know I do
Oh, I, I, I need you
When the goin' gets rough
You know I do

At the start, I couldn't say
All my feelings I could not portray
But I gotta tell you now
That I really need your love, babe
Oh, it's comin' on strong

I feel so secure
When you are here beside me
There is nothin' that can bring me down

Oh, more and more
You take me way up high, babe
And you teach me what love is all about

Oh, I, I, I need you
Babe you know, you know I do
Oh, I, I, I need you
When the goin' gets rough
You know I do

Oh, I, I, I need you
Babe you know, you know I do
Oh, I, I, I need you
When the goin' gets rough
You know I do
