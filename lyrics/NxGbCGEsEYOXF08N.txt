So you're running 'round the world
With your head above the ground
And you're dancing too close behind
To the darling in a hidden shroud
And you don't know how you got here before
You were dancing with the wrong hand

Wandering in dreams I had before
And they play in my mind
I see you standing wasted alone
In my mind, in my mind

So you're running 'round the world
With your head above the ground
And you're dancing too close behind
To the darling in a hidden shroud
And you don't know how you got here before
You were dancing with the wrong hand

Wandering in dreams I had before
And they play in my mind
I see you standing wasted alone
In my mind, in my mind.
