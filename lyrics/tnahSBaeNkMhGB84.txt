Will I disappear with a vision of tomorrow?
Will I disappear?
Will I disappear with a vision of tomorrow?
Will I disappear until I can't feel the light?

Will I disappear with the memory of the sorrow?
Will I disappear until I can't feel the light
Ten years of hope have passed, you felt alone
And pictured life a little differently

And people say that life has just begun
You waited patiently, a lotus in the sun

You radiate for me in luminescent light

And people say that life has just begun
When you're not a part of me I feel dead inside
Disturbed; will I disappear with a vision of tomorrow
Until I can't feel the light

Disturbed; When I get the feeling I've been here before
I'm the abandoner
Ten years of sorrow passed
No pleasure in the sun

You couldn't cope in all honesty
The secrets of the past will come undone
Seasons of change elapse
Honour no mistrust

Faithfully until the day you die

And people say the journey's just begun
When you're not a part of me, I feel dead inside
Disturbed; will I disappear with a vision of tomorrow
Or will I fall?
Disturbed; when I get the feeling I've been here before
Disturbed; will I disappear with a vision of tomorrow
Or will I fall?
Disturbed; when I get the feeling I've been here before
I'm the abandoner
