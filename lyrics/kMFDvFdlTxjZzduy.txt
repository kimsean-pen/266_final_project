Take me out to see the pretty lights
Cause I'm high as fuck tonight
I wanna go to
New York City, Vegas, London, France
Got me wrapped up in your hands

Every time you look away
My heart slips through your fingers
Every time you walk away
I just hope you'll remember

Ten reasons I could just die
In your arms without you
Fuck it...

'Cause nothing matters without you
No nothing holds me like you do, oh-oh-oh
So-oh-oh...
Help me, help me, I'm dyin' baby
Help me, help me, come on and save me
Nothing matters without you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

Drive me down my coast at 9 to 5
Livin' like it's our last night
I wanna take my clothes off at the beach at 4 AM
Press your lips up to my skin

Every time you look my way
My heart beats just like thunder
Every time you say my name
I can never recover

Ten reasons I could just die
In your arms without you
Fuck it...

'Cause nothing matters without you
No nothing holds me like you do, oh-oh-oh
So-oh-oh...
Help me, help me, I'm dyin' baby
Help me, help me, come on and save me
Nothing matters without you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

Don't let me take my last breath without you
Don't let me take my last breath without you
Don't let me take my last breath without you
Don't let me take my last breath

Don't let me take my last breath without you
Don't let me take my last breath without you
Don't let me take my last breath without you
Don't let me take my last breath

'Cause nothing matters without you
No nothing holds me like you do, oh-oh-oh
So-oh-oh...
Help me, help me, I'm dyin' baby
Help me, help me, come on and save me
Nothing matters without you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
