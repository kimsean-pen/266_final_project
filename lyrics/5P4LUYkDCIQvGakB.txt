Power to the people, power to the people
Power to the people, power to the people

Power to the people, power to the people
Power to the people, power to the people, right on

Say we want a revolution
We better get on right away
Well, get then on your feet
And enter the street

Singin' power to the people, power to the people
Power to the people, power to the people, right on

A million workers workin' for nothin'
You better give 'em what they really own
We got to put you down
When we come into town

Singin' power to the people, power to the people
Power to the people, power to the people, right on

I got to ask you, comrades and brothers
How do you treat you own woman back home?
She got to be herself
So she can hear herself

Singin' power to the people, power to the people
Power to the people, power to the people, right on

Now, now, now, now

Oh well, power to the people, power to the people
Power to the people, power to the people, right on

Oh yeah, power to the people, power to the people
Power to the people, power to the people, right on

Power to the people, power to the people
Oh well, power to the people, power to the people

Oh well, power to the people, power to the people
