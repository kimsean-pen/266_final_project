In my bed I dream at night
By the man who couldn't see
You took my hand and held it tight
You said: "what will people think of me?"

Sit tight, one or the other will win
Cool hand, no time for leaving, we're in
I think I'm dreaming
What will people think of me?

You will be my vaccine yea
And I'll be your in-betweener
We'll wake of happy air
From all our dreams, all our dreams x2

Counting sheep past 2 AM
Hoping you will comfort me
But still with sits and waits
To say: "what will people think of me?"

Sit tight, one or the other will win
Cool hand, no time for leaving, we're in
I think I'm dreaming
What will people think of me?

You will be my vaccine yea
And I'll be your in-betweener
We'll wake of happy air
From all our dreams, all our dreams x2

Sit tight, one or the other will win
Cool hand, no time for leaving, we're in
I think I'm dreaming
What will people think of me?

You will be my vaccine yea
And I'll be your in-betweener
We'll wake of happy air
From all our dreams, all our dreams x2

4x From all our dreams, all our dreams
