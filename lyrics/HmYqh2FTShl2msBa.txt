Late at night, all systems go, you've come to see the show
We do our best, you're the rest, you make it real, you know
There's a feeling deep inside that drives you fuckin' mad
Feeling of a hammerhead, you need it, oh, so bad

Adrenaline starts to flow
Thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

Bang your head against the stage like you did before
Make it ring, make it bleed, make it really sore
In a frenzied madness, leathers and spikes
Heads are breaking all around, it's hot as Hell tonight

Adrenaline starts to flow
Thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

On stage, the Marshall noise is piercing through your ears
Kicks your ass, kicks your face, end the fucking tears
Now's the time to let it rip, to let it fuckin' loose
Gathered here to maim and kill, 'cause this is what we choose

Adrenaline starts to flow
Thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

The show is through, the metal's gone, it's time to hit the road
Another town, another gig, again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways, learnin' in your bed
Never stop, never quit, we are MotoÌˆrhead

Adrenaline starts to flow
Thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Acting like a maniac

Whiplash
Motherfucker
