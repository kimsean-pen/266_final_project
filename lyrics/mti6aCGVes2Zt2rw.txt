Here's a penny for your thoughts
Incedentally you may keep the change
And here's a book of ettiquette
I bought to keep sane

And mutual friends say make amends
And a stitch in time saves nine or ten
Goodbyes
Flesh of my flesh
Flesh of my flesh
Flesh of my flesh

The difference between you and me
Is that the world owes you a living
And you always tow the party line
In your loving and your giving

Our mutual friends say make amends
And a stitch in time saves nine or ten
Goodbyes
Flesh of my flesh
Flesh of my flesh
Flesh of my flesh
