Lonely Richard, you know yourself
You've known yourself for all time
Like creatures of earth and other births
You've been that way for all time
Hanging love you placed it there
I may leave now for a while
Do you know me like they know me there
My friends out there on the horizon
You see things like me we're never free
My friends out there on the horizon.

Have yourself a good time
Have yourself a good time

Street preacher/ sweet creature you know yourself
You've know yourself for all time
This is a curse, a color burn
Black roses there out on the vine
Looking like me I'm like the wind in the steppes
I can sit there they have the tiiiiiiiiime
Just give me a second, now... there it's done
To move out there on the horizon
Do you know me like you know yourself
My friends out there on the horizon.

Have yourself a good time
Have yourself a good time
Have yourself a good time
Have yourself a good time

It's all fine it's on my mind
I never lost my eye on you
We don't mind what's on my mind
I never ever harmed you.
