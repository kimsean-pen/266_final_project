Oh has the reaper and the sun
I wait to see the darkness sprung
I used to think my mind was one
But now I feel I'm different
I wish I was a wild swan
The sky's my world
My very own pond
The rain will fall and slit my throat
The heaven's voices silent
I wish I was a wild tree
The wind will blow to refreshen me
I change my covers and change my leaves
But trees look very lonely
Looks like I'll just be myself
And put my dreams upon the shelf
I keep my worries or lose my head
It's better than being nothing

Looks like I'll just be myself
And put my dreams upon the shelf
I keep my worries or lose my head
It's better than being nothing
