Huh, yeah, oh, hey, yeah, huh
Oh, yeah, uh, huh, yeah

Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away

I've done alright up to now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls

Oh, wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down

I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh, wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Somebody oh, somebody oh
Somebody who loves me, yeah
Somebody oh, somebody oh
To hold me in his arms oh

I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls, my lonely heart calls

Oh, wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Hoo, hoo, dance, c'mon baby he, he, he, he
Woo yeah he, he, he

Don'tcha wanna dance with me baby?
Don'tcha wanna dance with me boy?
Hey don'tcha wanna dance with me baby?
With somebody who loves me

Don'tcha wanna dance? Say you wanna dance
Don'tcha wanna dance?
Don'tcha wanna dance? Say you wanna dance

Don'tcha wanna dance? Say you wanna dance uh, huh

With somebody who loves me
