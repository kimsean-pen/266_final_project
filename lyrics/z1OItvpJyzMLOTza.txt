Infatuation, she's a fatal attraction hang around, screw up my mind
I hope I've seen her for the very last time

Danger's intriguing but I don't want to die got to leave this psycho behind
I hope I've seen her for the very last time

And I can't wait 'til tomorrow, I can't wait another day
I can't wait 'til tomorrow, tomorrow she goes away, hey

Over my shoulder, I keep looking back, I feel a presence following me
So I know I'll never be free

And I can't wait 'til tomorrow and I can't wait another day
I can't wait 'til tomorrow, tomorrow she goes away, hey yeah

Over my shoulder, I keep looking back I feel a presence following me
And so I know I'll never be free

And I can't wait 'til tomorrow and I can't wait another day
I can't wait 'til tomorrow, tomorrow she goes away, hey yeah
