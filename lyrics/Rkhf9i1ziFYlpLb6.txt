Come and see me and maybe you'll die
But I can keep you in artwork, the fluid kind
That's enough for excitements today
Frustrated faded, it's pay-to-play

Come and see me yeah, maybe you'll try
I've been holding these pyros til they could fly
Open up and enlighten again
Enjoy the skyline, it's an incremental end

Walk in on your own feet
Says the rover
It's my way or they all leave
Says the rover
The rover

Starts to be hell, yeah, maybe it's time
You can't stick to the highways, it's suicide
I'm welling up with excitements again
The apex resolves, you need to tell your friends

Walk in on your own feet
Says the rover
It's my way or they all leave
Says the rover
The rover
(Ooooh, Ooooh)
The rover
(Ooooh, Ooooh)
The rover

Come and see me, yeah baby, let's cry
Sat in facing southwards we need to die
Nature's subjected to fires again
You're falling in for my independence

Walk in on your own feet
Says the rover
I am on the wrong street
Till the rover
Said I'm, all in
The rover
I'm in, all in
The rover

(Ooooh, Ooooh)
The rover
All in
(Ooooh, Ooooh)
All in
The rover
He barely has to seek the answer
