Sailed on a ship of paper
And I sank in the deep of your eyes
I got lost in your graveyard
Now I dream on a bed of knives

I found the map to your maps
I lost the shores for you
But now I'll never get back
'Cause I'm a ghost ship on the blue

Now I hold my poems
For ladies unknown
Until my hands go weak
I'll be a ghost ship on the blue

Birds are in the sky
The land's been gone for days
And all you left was time
To find a solid grave

Pirates never loved
The way that I do
You never said enough
To keep me next to you

Now I hold my poems
For ladies unknown
Until my hands go weak
I'll be a ghost ship on the blue
