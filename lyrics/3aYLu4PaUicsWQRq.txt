The throne of time
Is a kingly, a kingly thing
From whence
You know
We all do begin
And dressed as you are girl
In your fashions
Of fate baby its too late
Shallow of the actions
Of the children
Of the men
Fogged was their vision
Since the ages began
And lost like a lion
In the canyons
Of smoke baby its no joke
oh no
Its no joke oh no
