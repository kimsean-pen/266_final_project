Nobody stands
In between me
And my man
It's me and
Mr. Jones
(Me and Mr. Jones)

What kind of
Fuckery is this?
You made me miss the
Slick Rick gig
(Oh, Slick Rick)

And thought I didn't
Love you when I did
(When I did)

Can't believe
You played me out
Like that
(Out)

No, you ain't worth
Guest list
Plus one of all
'damn' girls you kiss
(All them girls)

You can't keep lying
To yourself like this
(To yourself)

Can't believe you played
Yourself like this
(Out)

Rulers one thing
But come Brixton
Nobody stands in
Between me
And my man
'Cause it's me and
Mr. Jones
(Me and Mr. Jones)

What kind of
Fuckery are we?
Nowadays
You don't mean
Dick to me
(Dick to me)

I might let you
Make it up to me
(Make it up)

Who's playing
Saturday?
What kind
Of fuckery
Are you?
Side from Sammy
You're my best
Black Jew
(Best black Jew)

But I could swear that
We were through
(We were through)

I still wonder
'bout the things'
You do
Mr. Destiny
9 and 14
Nobody stands in
Between me
And my man
'Cause it's me
And Mr. Jones
Mr. Jones
(Me and Mr. Jones)

Me
And Mr. Jones
Me and ...
