While passing through the clouds of diamond dust
As two mock suns arise beside our one
The sun fredericort guide the way towards the east
And set behind the valley of calm trees
The destination, unfamiliar sands
Amongst the ice fog
A DC 8 awaits
Our means of travel
To visionary worlds
Let us imagine
Down in the valley the calm trees
Are swaying in time
(We can't avert our eyes)
Down in the valley the flowers
Are food for the mind
(No sign of passing time)
Over the hills where the mountains
Are tumbling down
(A place of natural wonder)
Visions are clear as we notice
The three suns align
Upon arrival, the dust and deserts drone
And no resistance
Could keep us from all time
There is no notion
In visionary worlds
Let us imagine
Down in the valley the calm trees
Are swaying in time
(We can't avert our eyes)
Down in the valley the flowers
Are food for the mind
(No sign of passing time)
Over the hills where the mountains
Are tumbling down
(A place of natural wonder)
Visions are clear as we notice
The three suns align
Traveling over the valley we feel the breeze
Taking in everything that there is to be seen
The suns in the distance are moments away from the dream
