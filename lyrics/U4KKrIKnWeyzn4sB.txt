With you on top of me,
and me underneath you.
I bet we'll go 100 miles an hour
through the ceiling
Cause I am numb
I am numb to the feeling
Looking for that sexual healing
Cause our loves the only thing that could matter
take me up and up and up like a ladder
our loves the only thing that could matter
take me up and up and up like a ladder
Yeah maybe that could be my thing
what do ya think?
Im talking two young lovers and half priced drinks
I could fight the rainclouds in your life
Every day, every night.
Smashing bottles and steppin on glass
has never felt so good in the past
Im only human with my flaws
just a fool without a cause
With you grinding on me
And me grinding back on you
I bet we look beautiful
Slip sliding on the dance floor
Cause our loves the only thing that could matter
take me up and up like a ladder
Our loves the only thing that could matter
take me up and up like a ladder
Yeah baby that could be my thing
what do ya think?
Im talking two young lovers and half priced drinks
I could fight the rainclouds in your life
Every day, every night.
Yeah maybe that could be my thing
what do ya think?
Im talking two young lovers and half priced drinks
I could fight the rainclouds in your life
Every day, every night.
(Trumpet solo)
Cause our loves the only thing that could matter
take me up and up like a ladder.
Yeah maybe that could be my thing
what do ya think?
Im talking two young lovers and half priced drinks
I could be the rainbow in your sky
Shooting stars above you every night
