Wake up, breathe in all the fading stars in a line above
Night comes alive cause light shines like memories of you
There's no disguise in this masquerade play the part of you
Cast me aside cause night dies like moths to the flame

Enter the realm of the cold stone hearted
Sad center stage of her loneliness
Come let me in I can feel she's started
Burning the plains

Heavenly in a perfectly fantasy ecstasy
Into war I will fly
Suddenly in a dream away fairytale led astray
By the magical eye
By the magical eye

Fall out, fly into the enemies to my nemesis
Drake of the sky when light turns to ashes of you

Enter the realm of the cold stone hearted
Sad center stage of her loneliness
Come let me in I can feel she's started
Burning the plains

Heavenly in a perfectly fantasy ecstasy
Into war I will fly
Suddenly in a dream away fairytale led astray
By the magical eye
Heavenly in a perfectly fantasy ecstasy
Into war I will fly
Suddenly in a dream away fairytale led astray
By the magical eye

In the darklight of the morning
Send a raven with a warning
Of a legion on the move in all of its glory
Enter the realm of the cold stone hearted
Sad center stage of her loneliness
Come let me in I can feel she's started
Burning the plains

Heavenly in a perfectly fantasy ecstasy
Into war I will fly
Suddenly in a dream away fairytale led astray
By the magical eye
Heavenly in a perfectly fantasy ecstasy
Into war I will fly
Suddenly in a dream away fairytale led astray
By the magical eye
