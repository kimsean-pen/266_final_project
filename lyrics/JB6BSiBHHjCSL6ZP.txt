Made myself a little garden
To grow myself my only friends
Got myself a brand new start, and
Oh no, I screwed it up again

Guess I'm stayin' up all night
In my mind, but out of sight
I'm to blame for this
I hide away, until, the day is through
I will pay for this
But find a way to push the blame on you
I won't run from this
Hide away, until, the day is through

Can't believe my eyes this mornin'
I found a plot of weeds instead
Yesterday was so adoring
My God's so easy to offend

I would rather fly than fight
Close my eyes and hang on tight

Not to blame for this
I hide away, until, the day is through
I will run from this
I'll find a way to push the blame on you
Be alright tomorrow
Hide away, until, the day is through

It's so simple
It's as easy as it can be
Make a monster
Lock it up, throw away the key

In the backyard
Buried deep underneath the tree
There's a monster
Taking root in the property

In the garden
Where the weeds are now growin' free
In the garden
Where my friends plot to bury me
There's a jungle
It's as far as the eye can see
Overgrown now
It's no longer a fantasy

But it's too late
By the time that I've realized
I can't see now
'cause the dirt is up to my eyes
