It's a cruel, cruel world
To face on your own
A heavy cross
To carry along
The lights are on
But everyone's gone
And it's cruel

It's a funny way
To make ends meet
When the lights are out
On every street
It feels alright
But never complete
Without joy

I checked you
If it's already been done
Undo it
It takes two
It's up to me and you
To prove it

On the rainy nights
Even the coldest days
You're moments ago
But seconds away
The principle of nature
It's true but
It's a cruel world

We can play it safe
Or play it cool
Follow the leader
Or make up all the rules
Whatever you want
The choice is yours
So choose

I checked you
If it's already been done
Undo it
It takes two
And it's up to me and you
To prove it

I trust you
It's already been done
Undo it
It takes two
It's up to me and you
To prove it

I checked you
If it's already been done
Undo it
It takes two
And it's up to me and you
To prove it

I trust you
