Excuse me Mr
Excuse me Ms
I got a problem
I got a lot of em
Are you right here with me
Are you listening
Do you feel similar
Feel anything
There's no relief for me
I'm just a person
I bow and bend
Afraid of everything
Just a citizen
I can't breathe out
I can't breathe in
I can't explain the state I'm in
It's getting harder
It's getting hard
To stay human
To stay being
