Things just ain't the way that they used to be
Back in the day when a man meant security
After working hard all week
Baby kick back and throw up your feet
Let me fix you a little treat say it might be little bit sweet

But he's worth it
He deserves it
He may not be perfect
He's all the man I need

He's ready and willing
Gives me the feeling
And whenever we're together
I know I'm where I belong

It's just the way he looks into your eyes
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares
And he's always there, don't you love that man?

Things ain't the way they used to be
When a woman and a man work hard to be
Happy in love and staying together ooh
Let's stay that way forever

Never give in to a fight just try and work it out
Never give up on him that's not what love's about
Stay true to your feelings and remember
All the things he's done for you

It's just the way he looks into your eyes
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares
And he's always there, don't you love that man?

It's just the way he looks into your eyes
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares
And he's always there, don't you love that man?

You'd better know I'm talking about that old-school love
That everlasting feeling can't never be too much
Somebody loves you heart and soul
Hold on, don't stop, better never let him go

It's just the way he looks into your eyes
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares
And he's always there, don't you love that man?

It's just the way he looks into your eyes
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares
And he's always there, don't you love that man?

It's just the way he looks into your eyes
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares
And he's always there, don't you love that man?
