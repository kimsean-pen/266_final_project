Another day stuck in repeat
Another someone judging me
Another hour I hold it in
Another time I force a grin

Another god who doesn't speak
Another leader that's a thief
Another day without a choice
Another day without a voice

I'll hold it in, I'll hold it in, I'll hold it in
Forget it
Now I'll throw the first punch
'Cause I've kept my mouth shut
For far too long
Enough's enough
And you say I'm wrong but it feels right
And it's about damn time
It's been too long
Enough's enough, enough
Enough's enough
Enough's enough

Another time that I get burned
Another way that I've been hurt
Another year too little pay
Another person in my way
Another lover says goodbye
Another lack of reasons why
Another day I'll let it slide
Another way you try to change my life

I'll hold it in, I'll hold it in, I'll hold it in
Forget it
Now I'll throw the first punch
'Cause I've kept my mouth shut
For far too long
Enough's enough
And you say I'm wrong but it feels right
And it's about damn time
It's been too long
Enough's enough, enough
Enough's enough
Enough's enough
Enough's enough

Right between the eyes
Right between the eyes
Right between the eyes
Right between the eyes
Right between the eyes
Right between the eyes
Forget it, forger it

I'll throw the first punch
'Cause I've kept my mouth shut
For far too long
I'll hold it in, forget it

Now I'll throw the first punch
'Cause I've kept my mouth shut
For far too long
Enough's enough
And you say I'm wrong but it feels right
And it's about damn time
It's been too long
Enough's enough

I'll trow the first punch (enough) (first punch)
I'll trow the first punch (enough) (first punch)
I'll trow the first punch (enough)
I'll trow the first punch (enough, enough, enough, enough)
