I don't want the sweet without the line
And I don't want the you without the mine
I wanna feel it
Yeah, I just wanna feel it
You know it's gotta cut just like a knife
You know I want it hot or cold as ice
To make me belive it
'Cause I gotta belive it
'Cause I'm just a wild thing
Give me the real thing
Baby, wind me up and watch me go
Don't need no parachute
You're not ever gonna catch my fall
Or slow me down
'Cause I just wanna hit the ground
And smash into you
When I jump
I wanna do it so recklessly
And when I take my aim
Yeah, you're gonna know my name
When I smash into you

Don't want the smooth without the rough
I don't want the push without the shove
When you're on the edge
Sometimes you gotta lose your head
And jump right off into the deep
I'll never look before I leap
'Cause i'd rather be careless
And leave them speechless
Don't need no parachute
You're not even gonna catch my fall
Or slow me down
'Cause I just wanna hit the ground
And smash into you
When I jump
I wanna do it so recklessly
And when I take my aim

Yeah, you're gonna know my name

When I smash into you

Smash into you
Smash into you
Smash into you
'Cause I'm just a wild thing
Give me the real thing
Baby, wind me up and watch me go
Watch me go
Don't need no parachute
You're not even gonna catch my fall
Or slow me down
'Cause I just wanna hit the ground
And smash into you

When I jump
I wanna do it recklessly

And when I take my aim

Yeah, you're gonna know my name
When I smash into you

Smash into you
smash into you
smash into you
