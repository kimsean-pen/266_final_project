Baby I see them boys
They always lookin' at you
But I ain't causin' a scene
Cause girl I'm the
One that's with you
They can shoot you a wink
They can buy you a drink
Try to steal your attention
They can talk a big talk
They can walk a big walk
But I know you ain't
Going home with 'em

Girl nobody, nobody,
Nobody gonna love you like I do
Yeah nobody, nobody,
Nobody gonna love you like I do
I'mma love you till the good
Lord comes back for me and you
Yeah nobody, nobody,
Nobody gonna love you like I do

I know how you like your coffee
And how hot you like your bath
I know what makes you angry
And what makes you laugh
I know the taste of your lips
Every inch of your skin
The little things that turn you on
I know that look in your eyes
When they look back at mine
Saying baby take me home

Girl nobody, nobody,
Nobody gonna love you like I do
Yeah nobody, nobody,
Nobody gonna love you like I do
I'mma love you till the good
Lord comes back for me and you
Yeah nobody, nobody,
Nobody gonna love you like I do

I'm going to love you, love you
The only way that I know
I'm going to love you, love you
Like there's no tomorrow
Yeah nobody, nobody,
Nobody gonna love you like I do

Girl nobody, nobody,
Nobody gonna love you like I do
Yeah nobody, nobody,
Nobody gonna love you like I do
I'mma love you till the good
Lord comes back for me and you
Girl nobody, nobody,
Nobody gonna love you like I do

Yeah nobody, nobody,
Nobody gonna love you like I do
