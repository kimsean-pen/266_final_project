Oh
How quickly I come undone
Like melting ice on the sun
Why would that stop when I'm falling free
Midnight daydream
Oh
You watch me and I'm exposed
Like lightning bolts in my bones
Why would that stop when I'm falling free
Midnight daydream
Oh
How quickly I come undone
Like melting ice on the sun
Why would that stop when I'm falling free
Midnight daydream
Oh
You watch me and I'm exposed
Like lightning bolts in my bones
Why would that stop when I'm falling free
Midnight daydream
