Take me somewhere nice.
To some tired island,
In your heart,
Called Paradise.

Though we wander home
We both feel alone
Like escapees
With nowhere to go.

I can think of
A thousand ways.
To get good and lost
Beyond these hopeless days ...

Where we'll rendezvous
Out of the blue
And take a deep breath
Just we two

And we'll be so far gone
The oars will row on
And we will happily wave
So long

If we hook a dream
And it tows us back down
This open stream
We'll say hello
Oh, Oh
Take us wherever you go.

Take me somewhere deep.
'Cause I'm quite exhausted
And I need to sleep
Or climb the great divide
Or wake up beside myself
Just to know I'm alive.

Every wait around
Pays me a visit
And drags my eyelids down.
They sting like growing pains
Iced in the veins of a guy
Who's not ready to die

If I may be so bold
I'll weather the cold.
'Cause I'm not afraid to grow old.

If we hook a dream
And it tows us back down
This open stream
We'll say hello
Oh, Oh
Take us wherever you go.
