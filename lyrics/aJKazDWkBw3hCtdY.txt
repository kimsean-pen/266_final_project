You are my love
you are the one that I adore
You are my love
You are what I have waited for.
Oh, you are my love
Oh, you are my love
Oh, you are my love

You are my day
You changed my Winter into spring
You came my way and then my heart began to sing
Oh, you are my love
Oh, you are my love
Oh, you are my love

Times were getting lonely
I was thinking only
Yesterday about the friends I thought I had
But no-one ever came to call on
They weren't around to close the door on
Never thought that things would get that way

You are my love
You are the one I'll always need
You are my love
For you I'd get down on my knees.
Oh, you are my love
Oh, you are my love
Oh, you are my love

You are my love (Times were getting lonely)
You are the one that I adore (I was thinking only)
You are my love (Yesterday about the friends)
You are the one what I have waited for (who used
to call on me)
Oh, you are my love
Oh, you are my love
Oh, you are my love
