You're Lying here with me
You're Lying it kills me
You're Lying here with me
You're Lying it kills me

(Lie and Look. Lie and Lie and Look. Lie and Look)
All your words so cold to me
I don't wanna hear no more apologies
(Lie and Look. Lie and Lie and Look. Lie and Look)
All your words so cold to me
I don't wanna hear no more apologies
(Lie and Look. Lie and Lie and Look. Lie and Look)
All your words so cold to me
I don't wanna hear no more apologies
(Lie and Look. Lie and Lie and Look. Lie and Look)
All your words so cold to me
I don't wanna hear no more apologies

On my knees, I'm begging, please
You're so cold I feel the freeze
I'm dying here I need a squeeze
The unease, tell me what's she's got that I do not
I need the peace
Burn these fucking sheets
If you don't want me then release
Fuck this shit I'm overseas
Australia's got no love for me
So sick of this love's felonies
I guess we'll just be enemies
The roar of burning memories
Sounds like the perfect melody

Enough of all the jealousy
I'll drown the bitch in Hennesy
Hennesy (You're Lying here with me) Hennesy
Enough of all the jealousy (You're Lying it kills me)
I'll drown the bitch in Hennesy
Hennesy (You're Lying here with me) Hennesy
Enough of all the jealousy (You're Lying it kills me)
I'll drown the bitch in Hennesy

(Lie and Look. Lie and Lie and Look. Lie and Look)
All your words so cold to me
I don't wanna hear no more apologies
(Lie and Look. Lie and Lie and Look. Lie and Look)
All your words so cold to me
I don't wanna hear no more apologies
(Lie and Look. Lie and Lie and Look. Lie and Look)
All your words so cold to me
I don't wanna hear no more apologies
(Lie and Look. Lie and Lie and Look. Lie and Look)
All your words so cold to me
I don't wanna hear no more apologies

Never been the one to trust
Fuck your love I'll buy some lust
Shit goes bust and I swerve off
I'll burn this house down, Molotov
Cocktails and Aperol
I'll drown myself in alcohol
Hang with girls that got no soul
Stalk my insta... watch it all
Cut the chain so now I ball
Rolling in the underworld
Wanted us to grow together
But you let our love unfurl
Silly girl, Superman
I thought that you would rescue me

Now your just a pest to me
I'll drown the bitch in Hennesy
Hennesy (You're Lying here with me) Hennesy
Enough of all the jealousy (You're Lying it kills me)
I'll drown the bitch in Hennesy
Hennesy (You're Lying here with me) Hennesy
Enough of all the jealousy (You're Lying it kills me)
I'll drown the bitch in Hennesy

(Lie and Look. Lie and Lie and Look. Lie and Look)
All your words so cold to me
I don't wanna hear no more apologies
(Lie and Look. Lie and Lie and Look. Lie and Look)
All your words so cold to me
I don't wanna hear no more apologies
(Lie and Look. Lie and Lie and Look. Lie and Look)
All your words so cold to me
I don't wanna hear no more apologies
(Lie and Look. Lie and Lie and Look. Lie and Look)
All your words so cold to me
I don't wanna hear no more apologies
