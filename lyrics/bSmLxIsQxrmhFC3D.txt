Forever betrayed, we stand at the edge,
Ourselves are to blame, there's no turning back
We buy into this madness
Waste every resource and remain mindless
We stand and watch the world decay
Living a lie as we're wasting away
There's no measure of control,
No concept of what we hold
We've bled our future dry, and there's no one else left to blame
In this mindless paradigm,
We can only decline.
Our future's being sold, by the hands of greed.
But what is the real cost?

Watch as we all collapse,
I tell you that we've lost our way,
Under the dying sun,
Watch as we all collapse
Watch as we all collapse

Sedated masses swallow headlines over and over again
So consumed in the mundane, there's no way for us to maintain
This vicious cycle is, spinning out of control
We're left dead behind the eyes and there's no one else left to blame
In this mindless paradigm,
We can only decline
Our future's being sold, by the hands of greed
But what is the real cost?

Watch as we all collapse,
I tell you that we've lost our way,
Under the dying sun,
Watch as we all collapse
Undet the dying sun,
Watch as we all collapse

Staring at the end, a future obsolete
We're only living to consume, ourselves
In this mindless paradigm,
We can only decline
