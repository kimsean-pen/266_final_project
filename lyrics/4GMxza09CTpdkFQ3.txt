Time the great deadener
Returning hard kisses at last
A love etched in blood
A love has come to pass

O glued the letter to your mouth
As treason climbed all over your face
Like a kitten, yet not so playfully

Do not play with me
I glued the letter to your hand
To consecrate the moment

This too shall end in fire
This too shall end
She wore mourning like a graceless flower
Blind to each sign of fear

So insecure
So unaware of me

I glued the letter to your heart
Crimson flowered redemption

November washed away the smoke
November washed it all away
All the guilty and all the glory
All the stories overheard

Forever entwined, yet forever enthroned
Hope dies painless with me
