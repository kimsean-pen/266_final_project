She was a simple girl, coming from a simple town
Still a child she started to work
She never had time for school

Had a boyfriend, young,
Unemployed, wasted and stoned
Expelled from home for moralistic reasons
She started to live with him

She was only 16, trying to live with misery
Day after day, wasting her life
She decided to sell her body

Walking down corners and dark lanes
Night lights dazzles her mind
Crime and voilence on her way
Soon she was the queen of the night

(Chorus:)
Midnight queen, alone in the night
Always dreaming of better days
Midnight queen, trying to survive
But so many thorns on her way
Midnight queen, I'm sorry for you life,
For your sorrow, for your fate
Midnight queen

Dreaming of better days
That will never come
Another night has just begun

Into drugs and booze she throws herself
Trying to escape from reality
She won't escape

Found in a motel room
Her sweet blood everywhere
A few bucks on her body

And around her neck
Tied with a dead know
Hang a lash

(chorus)
