You, you aint got no love today
You, you aint got no love today
Don't let them bring me down

You, you aint got no love today
You, you aint got no love today
Don't let them bring you down
Hold on, don't let them bring you down
Hold on, don't let them bring you down

Don't let them bring you down
Don't let them bring you down

Got no love
Got no love
