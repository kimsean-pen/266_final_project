And we keep speeding
And we keep speeding

And we keep crashing
And we keep crashing

And we keep reaching
And we keep reaching
And we keep crying
'Til we start laughing

Long before my fall from grace
For a piece of me, they appeared
From the throat, I'm tied to you
All of us, we're cracked in two

And the ones in the back cry: Wait for me
And the ones in the front cry: You're too slow, you're too slow
And the ones who are weak cry: Carry me
And the ones who are strong cry: Let me go, let me go

We reach for the things we idolize
But the rings are just for show
Her beauty is a form of charity

Dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow

Dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow
Dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow

(Na na na na na)

Long before my fall from grace
For a piece of me, they appear
From the throat, I'm tied to you
All of us, we're cracked in two

And the ones we ignore cry:
Come to me (Come to me)
Are the ones we adore cry
Give me space, give me space
And the ones who are cruel cry
Beg for me (Beg for me)
Are the ones that possess,
They love the chase, love the chase

We reach for the things we idolize
(Idolize)
But the rings are just for show
Her beauty is a form of charity
(Charity)
Dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow

Dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow

Dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow

Dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow

Dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow

And we keep speeding
And we keep speeding
(Na na na na na)

And we keep crashing
And we keep crashing
(Na na na na na)

And we keep reaching
And we keep reaching
(Na na na na na)

And we keep crying
'Til we start laughing
