The fashion party's over
Put my head on the shelf
A square of concrete, cut's a life
Into a half
To a half
Look at me now
Making love, to myself

Don't be, don't be,
Don't be a drag
Don't be, don't be,
Such a drag

Don't be, don't be,
Don't be a drag
Don't be, don't be,
Such a drag

Lecturing voice in my brain
Where shall I go, tonight
