Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime
Didn't you?
People call
Say, "Beware doll, you're bound to fall, you thought they were all"
Kidding' you?

You used to
Laugh about
Everybody that was
Hangin' out
Now you don't
Talk so loud
Now you don't
Seem so proud
About having to be scrounging
Your next meal

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home?
Like a complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?

Ah, you've
Gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get
Juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna
Have to get
Used to it

You say you never
Compromise
With the mystery tramp but now you
Realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum
Of his eyes
And say
"Do you want to
Make a deal?"
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own?
With no direction home?
A complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?

Ah, you
Never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did
Tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't
Let other people
Get your
Kicks for you

You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a
Siamese cat
Ain't it hard
When you discover that?
He really wasn't
Where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To have on your own?
With no direction home?
Like a complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?

Ah
Princess on the steeple and all the
Pretty people they're all drinkin', thinkin' that they
Got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts
But you'd better
Take your diamond ring
You'd better pawn it, babe

You used to be
So amused
At Napoleon in rags
And the language that he used
Go to him now
He calls you
You can't refuse
When you ain't got nothin'
You got
Nothin' to lose
You're invisible now
You got no secrets
To conceal

How does it feel?
Ah, how does it feel?
To be on your own?
With no direction home?
Like a complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?
