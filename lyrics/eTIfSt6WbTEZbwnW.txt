She's got a rose in her smile
She says she knows and she does

And her mind aches
And her heart breaks
'Cause she's silly

Gonna teach her to sin
'Cause I'm always knowing where she's been
Livin' on the wrong side of the tracks
And you know she's never
Coming back

She's got a smile like a flower
She looks so fine by the hour

But her mind aches
And her heart breaks
'Cause she's silly

Gonna teach her to steal
'Cause I'm always knowing
how she feels
Livin' on the wrong side of the tracks
And I know she's never
Coming back
Oh no...
And her mind aches...
And her heart breaks...
'Cause she's silly...
To me
