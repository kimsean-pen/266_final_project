City life just leaves me weak
All this madness on the street
Need to get away today
live my life a different way
Is it only fantasy
to dream about a perfect me?

I wanna
live like beautiful people
give like beautiful people
with like beautiful people around

Buy the latest magazine
and aspire to the dream
perfect home and perfect kids
not a life lived on the skids
Is it only fantasy
or could it be reality?

I wanna
live like beautiful people
give like beautiful people
with like beautiful people around

Now I can see myself
without a care in the world
It's a sun shining, money-spending
green and healthy new world
Is it only fantasy
or could it be reality?

I wanna
live like beautiful people
give like beautiful people
with like beautiful people around
