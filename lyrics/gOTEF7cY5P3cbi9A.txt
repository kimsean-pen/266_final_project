We're gonna get it
Gonna get it
Gonna get it, get it together and flower

Fixing up a car to drive in it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up
Up and up

Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up
Up and up

See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood
It's in your blood

Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up
Up and up

We're gonna get it, get it together
I know we're gonna get it, get it together somehow
We're gonna get it, get it together and flower

We're gonna get it, get it together
I know, we're gonna get it, get it together and float
We're gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up
(Up, and up, and up)
Up, and up, and up
(Up, and up, and up)
Up, and up, and up

Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up
Up and up

How come people suffer?
How come people part?
How come people struggle?
How come people break your heart?
Break your heart?

Yes I wanna grow, yes I want to feel
Yes I wanna know, show me how to
Heal it up
Heal it up

See the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love
Just need love
When the going is rough, saying

We're gonna get it, get it together
I know we're gonna get it, get it together somehow
We're gonna get it, get it together and flower

We're gonna get it, get it together
I know, we're gonna get it, get it together and float
We're gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up
(Up, and up, and up)
Up, and up, and up
(Up, and up, and up)
Up, and up, and up
(Up, and up, and up)
Up, and up, and up
(Up, and up, and up)
Up, and up, and up

We're gonna get it, get it together
I know we're gonna get it, get it together somehow
We're gonna get it, get it together and flower

We're gonna get it, get it together
I know, we're gonna get it, get it together and float
We're gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up
