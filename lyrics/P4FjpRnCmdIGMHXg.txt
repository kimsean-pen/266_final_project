Why is it so hard to accept the party is over?
You came with your new friend
And her mom jeans and her new Vans
And she's perfect and I hate it
Oh so glad you made it
I'm so glad you could come back

Somebody get the tacos
Somebody spark a blunt
Let's start the Narcos off at episode one
(Bring the gin)
Got the juice
(Bring the sin)
Got that too
Whoa, just shut up know you're my favorite
Am I...

Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
(Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya)
Is it warm enough for ya inside me-me-me-me
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
(Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya)
Warm enough outside, inside me-me-me-me

I get so lonely I forget what I'm worth
We get so lonely we pretend that it's worse
I'm so ashamed of myself think I need therapy

I'm sorry I'm not more attractive
I'm sorry I'm not more ladylike
I'm sorry I don't shave my legs at night

I'm sorry I'm not your baby mama
I'm sorry you got karma comin' to you
Collect and soak it in right

Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
(Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya)
Is it warm enough for ya inside me-me-me-me
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
(Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya)
Warm enough outside, inside me-me-me-me

Sorry, I just need to see you
I'm sorry I'm so clingy I don't me to be a lot
Do you really wanna love me down like you say you do?
Give it to me like you say you do?

Cause it's hard enough you got to treat me like this
Lonely enough to let you treat me like this
Do you really love me or just wanna love me down?

Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
(Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya)
Is it warm enough for ya inside me-me-me-me
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
(Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya)
Warm enough outside, inside me-me-me-me
Warm enough outside inside
Warm enough outside inside me-me-me-me me-me-me
Is it warm enough outside inside
