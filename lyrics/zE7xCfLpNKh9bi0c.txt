I'll tear the memories out of my subconscious and piece together where I went wrong.
Sewn together with the strands of lament,
I'll cloak myself in a veil of remorse and regret that keeps me bound to a world that will never forget.
So as I walk through the streets eyes and voices consume my mind,
They stare ambiguously.
Here I am, with all my insecurity;
All my imperfection crying out to a world that just won't listen.
Lend me your ears, your hearts and your minds,
And discover what's missing.
These words are the only thing keeping me from falling into the darkness,
Where my thoughts are no longer my own.
In the arms of my kin, my family.
In the hearts of those sincere.
In the face of adversity, here I am.
Free from hindrance, from all doubt, from all voices calling me out.
Here I am,
pouring my mind and heart into the world that doesn't listen.
For those who remember, for those who care, remember you are not alone.
Here I am, stuck in a world that never listens
(In a world that never listens)
Here I am, pouring my heart out,
I am not alone.
