(Announcer's Voice)
A peculiar thing happened to me this morning.
Just as I reached into my pocket to find it empty of any sou,
I saw two broken twigs on the ground,
Shaped like the Greek letters "F" and "S."
"F" and "S," Helium, "F" and "S."
These are the chemical symbols for iron and sulfur.
It was a sign, I'm sure, for me to make gold from these two elements.
I have been working all day,
Over these hellish flames.

Locked in his bedroom,
He saw the world,
A web of answers,
And cumshot girls.

Don't bother blaming,
These games and guns,
He's only playing,
And boys just want to have fun.

He picked a soundtrack,
And packed his bag,
He hung his Walkman,
Around his neck.

It's so simple,
The way they fall,
No cry, no whimper,
No sound at all.
