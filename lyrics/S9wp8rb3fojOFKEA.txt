No one really knows whose house you haunting
Places that you go are best with me
Every time you leave here
I'll keep it quiet
I guess that's all you want from me
Cause if it's all spinning 'round at the ball
And if the world's feeling crowded and small

Maybe you can be the big star at tonights show.
Should've took the high road
Now it's such a long way back

Instead I took the long road
Figured out it's something you can't take back
Should've took the high road
Now my days have all turned black
Instead I took the low road

Figured out it's something that we both lack
No one really knows just what you're wanting
Running round the bend these things aren't free
Thinking back at home I'm waiting on you
We've got our own places to be

Cause if it's all spinning 'round at the ball
And if the world's feeling crowded and small
Maybe you can be the big star at tonights show.
And if it's too late to pick up the call
And if you're torn up and sick of it all

Maybe you can only see far at the night's glow
But I should've took the high road

Now it's such a long way back
Instead I took the long road
Figured out it's something you can't take back
Should've took the high road
Now my days have all turned black
Instead I took the low road
Figured out it's something that we both lack
