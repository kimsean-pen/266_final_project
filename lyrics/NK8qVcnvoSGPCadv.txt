She runs through the valley of death and of sleeping
She laughs as she dances her feet wake the flowers
She comes up now running through a gloomy town
Yes jade is the girl of the hour.

We cant help but follow shes buddha just watch her.
She looks like an old gypsy woman, but swears shes a girl
And all that she asks, we'll allow her
Yes Jade is the girl of the hour

It is her hour so let it be hers
Find it and shine it and wind it always
It is her hour so let it be hers
Yes Jade is the girl of the hour.

The people in town just wake up to see her
For when she smiles they all feel the power
The strong men, the children, and even the cowards,
Know Jade is the girl of the hour.

It is her hour so let it be hers
Find it and shine it and wind it always
It is her hour and always its hers
Yes Jade is the girl of the hour.

You won't soon forget the name.

Softly now join her shes blessed for destruction
She sings in sounds of the hammer of god,
And I swear shes come her to fill us with power
Its Jade the girl of the hour

It is her hour so let it be hers
Find it and shine it and wind it always
It is her hour so let it be hers
Yes Jade is the girl of the hour

It is her hour so let it be hers
find it and shine it and wind it always
It is her hour so let it be hers
Yes Jade is the girl of the hour

You won't soon forget the name.
