If you could see the audacity upfront
You keep on holding over head
So quick to formulate, albeit the rest is futile
Too quick, too much
I'm nearby living a nervous wreck
Shadow dwelling, oh so tempting
Ceiling's almost folding in

Control
Less of that, better me
Let go
I won't let it follow me
Control
Appear with a new disguise
Let go
I can't let it follow me for years to come

I need to be what I'm actually here for
Limitations, self-inflict
Automation on self-control
I'll sink to my lowest form
Too quick, too much
Inedible, mysterious
All telling, oh so empty
World's almost folding in

Control
Less of that, better me
Let go
I won't let it follow me
Control
Appear with a new disguise
Let go
I can't let it follow me for years to come

Surrender control

Control
Less of that, better me
Let go
I won't let it follow me
Control
Appear with a new disguise
Let go
I can't let it follow me for years to come
