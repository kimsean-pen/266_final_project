Baby, life's what you make it
Can't escape it
Baby, yesterday's favorite
Don't you hate it

(Everything's all right)
Life's what you make it
(Everything's all right)

Baby, life's what you make it
Don't backdate it
Baby, don't try to shade it
Beauty's naked

(Everything's all right)
Life's what you make it
(Everything's all right)
What you make it

Baby, life's what you make it
Celebrate it, anticipate it
Yesterday's faded
Nothing can change it
Life's what you make it

(Everything's all right)
Life's what you make it
(Everything's all right)
Life's what you make it

(Everything's all right)
Life is what you make it
What you make it
What you make it

What you make it
Life is what you make it
Life is what you make it
