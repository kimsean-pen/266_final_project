I thought I saw you by the side,
Illuminating foreign climes.
A figment, a splinter, a vessel for me
To wander as freely as I'll ever be.

Shrapnel stars puncture brightly,
Wounding skies that stretch so widely
Over dunes of dust, in shades of rust,
Where shadows claim the both of us.

Is that an answer or is this an echo?
Are you the answer or are you an echo?

These godly skies kindly provide
The perfect scene for our goodbyes.
A providence, so palpable
It sets aflutter, palpiter.

Bleached by the moonlight,
Bathed in bonewhite,
Under cover of cobalt and shelter of slate
You appeared immaculate.

Is that an answer or is this an echo?
Are you the answer or are you an echo?

I know that distance lends enchantment to the view
But I know that I see you and I know you see me too
And so I called out
