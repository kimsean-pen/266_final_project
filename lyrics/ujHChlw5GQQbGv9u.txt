The city's fire
Trapped behind the earth
Digging in your deepest dirt

The reddest hue
Reminds you of you
Clinging love and falling true

On and On
All I want is honesty

Tree has snapped
Sparks are flying everywhere
Cables burnt and lines flare

And when the all in all
Comes falling down
It was just an accident
Something you can't help

On and On
All I want is honesty
