Oh, oh

Now you're gone, I'm left to pick up the pieces
Of a broke-broken heart you shattered
Exploded when you left us
Scarred with fear and fracture
You left a big disaster
There were so many questions
That we can never answer

I built this paper castle
I'll be the one to burn it down
I'll just forget what happened
Before the ashes hit the ground
Let's burn it down
Let's burn it down
Let's burn it down

You were so golden
That we forgot you're human and
In, in that second
Leaving the castle you would
Smash, crash into the ground
You weren't even fucking around
I wish you only knew
We were all here to catch you
We would have carried you

I built this paper castle
I'll be the one to burn it down
I'll just forget what happened
Before the ashes hit the ground

Once you take it, you can't take back
No it won't be a replacement
I wish we could've faced this
So we'll face it, we must face this
Find a reason to keep good faith in
What's left of this half-life?
Affected by a light that shone

I built this paper castle
I'll be the one to burn it down
I'll just forget what happened
Before the ashes hit the ground
Let's burn it down
Let's burn it down
Let's burn it down
Let's burn it down
Let's burn it down
Let's burn it down
Let's burn it down
