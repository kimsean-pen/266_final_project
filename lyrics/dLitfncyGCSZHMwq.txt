Somewhere in Time, We welcomed in the fall.
But in the distance we can see, shining clear, our demise to be.
We're not listening to our selves.

You ask these questions in subconsciousness, but still
We choose to Deny the flood surrounding nations.
Wake up! The water is rising now.
We are the universe inside of you waiting patiently.

All the World by a thread?
Distance the lies that are sold.
They will not justify the pain.
They will not live to see the day.
