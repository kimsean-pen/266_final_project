Stare into the sun stare into the sun
I'm gonna stare into the sun stare into the sun sun sun sun

There aint a cloud in the sky or nothing
I see the birds they fly on something
This is the summer it's the summer for the colour baby
The sun is shining down for lovers
But not for me it shines for others
You gave me love babe gave me love babe now it's over

I'm feeling blue because love is gone
Guess I lose but life goes on
Got a few tears to dry
Before these blue shade days are gone
And I can stare into the sun

I'm gonna swim in the seas of green I tell you
I'm gonna run like I'm 17 forever
I see a rainbow purple and gold but it's covered
Oh yeah cuz there's a cloud she follows me 'round wherever
Her last words keep raining down on shelter
You took your love babe took your love babe
And now the colors all melt together

I'm feeling blue because love is gone
Guess I lose but life goes on
Got a few tears to dry
Before these blue shade days are gone and I can stare into the sun

Stare into the sun stare into the sun I'm gonna stare into the sun stare into the sun

You gave me love babe gave me love babe you gave me love and took it away
You gave me love babe gave me love babe you gave me love and took it away
You gave me love babe gave me love baby you gave me love and took it away
You gave me love babe gave me love baby oooooohhh man I said oooohhh lordy

I'm feeling blue because love is gone
Guess I lose but life goes on
Got a few tears to dry
Before these blue shade days are gone and I can stare into the sun
Before these blue shade days are gone and I can stare into the sun

I've got a fever baby... your love
I've got a fever baby... it's your love
I said I'm blue baby I said I'm blue baby
I said I'm blue baby blue baby I said I'm blue baby

I'm crying out late now sun is gone
I'm crying out late now sun is gone
I need your love I need your love

Do you see me baby on the street
And I'm her king to her heat
And I love babe something more I need your love
