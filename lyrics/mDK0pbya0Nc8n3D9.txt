Sometimes in the morning
When I wake up
I shed a tear
I'm hoping
Come the night time
You'll open the door and reappear

I can promise to share
All my dreams I will dare
You set my heart racing when you get next to me
Still I don't think you care
Should I wait for your love
Or I'm waiting in vain
Somebody help me 'cause I'm falling
Head over heels in love again

You... you...
You're the one for and your love I think that I would do anything
You
You're the one for and your love I think that I would do anything

I miss you
I wanna kiss you
The sweet scent of roses is in your hair
See sometimes
When I get lonely
I still feel you beside me
When you're not there

I can promise to share
All my dreams I will dare
You set my heart racing when you get next to me
Still I don't think you care
Should I wait for your love
Or I'm waiting in vain
Somebody help me 'cause I'm falling
Head over heels in love again

You... youuu...
You're the one
And for your love I think that I would do anything
Yeah you you you you you
You're the one
And for your love I think that I would do anything

You're the one
You're the one and for your love I think that would anything
You know yeah you. you .you're the one and for your love
I think that I... I think that I would do anything

I can promise to share
All my dreams I will dare
You set my heart racing when you get next to me
Still I dont think you care
Should I wait for your love
Or I'm waiting in vain
Somebody help me cause I'm falling
Head over heels in love again

Help me... ohh can't you help me
I think I'm falling in love
I think I'm falling...
