Sinews tangled into rebar barbed
A double cross twisted into bitter knot
The dull ache resumes but it feels like a fresh wound
Scabs peeled back, with hydraulic steps

Ark of ravens, all lone survivors
Alone in a world so muted now
Take in the slack 'till pre-travel ends
The blast wash a breeze of fresh poison air

No separate ways
Only good byes

Trading spite limb by limb
A heat map carved with every death
The cowling draped in a ragged step
Whittling your heart down to dust

Loose ends tied with trip wires
A neat bow on your grave
Look down into the hollow return
Stabbing relentlessly...
