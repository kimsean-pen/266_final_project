Your eyes that once
Have gazed the waves
Have long been closed
Become enslaved

Within these walls
You lastly climbed
With fear engraved
The walls of time

This is the ground
You walked upon
The soil beneath
Your world long gone

This is the ground (this is the ground)
You walked upon (you walked upon)
The soil beneath (the soil)
Your world long gone

In tortured flesh
Your name is called
Inseminate
The bornless one

Invisible Gods
On planes apart
I thee invoke
Oh western star

This is the ground
You walked upon
The soil beneath
Your world long gone

This is the ground (this is the ground)
You walked upon (you walked upon)
The soil beneath (the soil)
Your world long gone

This is the ground
You walked upon
The soil beneath
Your world long gone

This is the ground
You walked upon
The soil beneath
Your world long gone

This is the ground
You walked upon
The soil beneath
Your world long gone

This is the ground
You walked upon
The soil beneath
Your world long gone

This is the ground (this is the ground)
You walked upon (you walked upon)
The soil beneath (the soil beneath)
Your world long gone
