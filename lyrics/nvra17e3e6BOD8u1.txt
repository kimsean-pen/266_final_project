Days gone by
The fountain of diversity is lost and found
The truth is shifting gears
She comes and leaves

Await the rising tide and face the passage of time
Crusaders that's what we are and we will rise in the dark
We unite heaven and earth and we will overcome

Embrace the martyr and the saint in all of us
We will brace against the tidal waves
It'll soon be over

Wash away pain and despair
Wash away danger and fear

This is the reign of reality
This is the reign of enlightenment

Embrace the martyr and the saint in all of us
We will brace against the tidal waves
It'll soon be over

And soon we will be free

Pain and despair
Danger and fear

Embrace the martyr and the saint in all of us
We will brace against the tidal waves
It'll soon be over

Wash away pain and despair
Wash away danger and fear
