Shoulder to shoulder, amused but not advanced
He, she, you, me, it's all just circumstance
Eager, hopeful, content to play the friend
Timid advances with mutual regret

She can't always be wrong, he can't always be right
Not a matter of choice, just a matter of time
Till they know where they stand once they've reached the end

Awkward choices with smiles from ear to ear
A faded union that won't survive the years
Timeless series of blameless accidents
Oh, the stubborn cycle of inherited mistakes

She can't always be wrong, he can't always be right
Not a matter of choice, just a matter of time
Till they know where they stand once they've reached the end

I'll be mine where I place my drafts
When the desert ends, I'll ask the dust
I'll be mine where I place my drafts
When the desert ends, I ask the dust
