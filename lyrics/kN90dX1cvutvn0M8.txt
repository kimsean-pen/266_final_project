When the words that you throw
Do so much more damage than stones
Down the road later on, let it go

You know that sort of guilt
Can tear down anything that you try to build
So relax I'll see you in a month

Do you still talk when you're asleep
Do you think of me when you fell free
After hours, your sinking deep
Did you think of me?

It never rains but it pours all week
Did you think of me?
When your halfway drunk and you're feeling mean
Do you think of me?

No you aren't worth the weight
Off all of the gold it would take
To pay back all your debts
So forget it

So here's where the wave broke
And turned back to the sea
You said "you thought you could trust me"
I said "I thought you looked guilty"
And I knew I was right

It never rains but it pours all week
Did you think of me?
When your halfway drunk and you're feeling mean
Do you think of me?

It never rains but it pours all week
Did you think of me?
When you are tired and can't shake sleep

Throw me to the wolves
Mention me by name
Pour oil on our troubled waters
And then set it to flame
Did you think of me?

It never rains but it pours all week
Did you think of me?
When your half-way drunk and you're feeling mean
Did you think of me?
Do you think of me?
Do you think of me?
