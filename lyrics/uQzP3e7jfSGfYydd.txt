Ever since I was eight or nine
I've been standing on the shoreline
For all my life I've been waiting
For something lasting
You loose your hunger and you loose your way
You get confused and then you fade away

Oh, this town
Kills you when you are young
Oh, this town
Kills you when you are young

I'm not the boy that I used to be
This town has got the youth of me
All the eyes turn hollow
From the work of sorrow

You die young
You die when you're young
You die when you're young
We are shadows
Oh, we're shadows
Just shadows in the alley
(This town, this town)

You're standing on the paving
By the office building
They've got so much to do
Never time for you

You die young
You die when you're young
You die when you're young
We are shadows
Oh, we're shadows
Just shadows in the alley
(This town, this town)

I've got nothing
Nothing to wait for
Nothing to wait for
(This town, this town, this town, this town, this town)
(This town, this town, this town, this town, this town)
Where is life in this town (This town, this town, this town)
Where is life in this town (This town, this town, this town)
