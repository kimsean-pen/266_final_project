We're in a junction, we're in a champagne room
But no other people are breathing this air with you
It's a secret, honey, a chocolate perfume
I like to close my eyes and feel the way it moves

We don't even dream
To breathe such a thin air
They all run away
Of this deja vu affair!

Bit head, and wind shine
I cannot grow appeal
Hallucinations of what the now reveals
It's realistic, and a sculptural idea
I like to say no words
And let the human feel
We don't even dream
What happens up there
We just rest away
Of this deja vu affair!
