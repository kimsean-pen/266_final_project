Cookin' up somethin' nice
Watch that garlic get all up in that dough
Nothing quite as divine
As the simmerin' skillit layin' on my stove

Take me away to, to my Versace Summer
Take me away to my holy grail in your bed
And we can sleep all day

Grab your boards and your buds
Don't you worry bout' the silly lifeguards
Catch that tube and woah!
Go ahead kid make your parents proud

Take me away to, to my Versace Summer
Take me away to my holy grail in your bed
And we can sleep all day

We'll stay inside, stay in our heads
And we'll make lots of garlic bread
It's not a joke, we need a break
From the whole world
So please just

Take me away to, to my Versace Summer
Take me away to my holy grail in your bed
And we can sleep all day
