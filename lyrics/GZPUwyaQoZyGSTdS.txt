This is the start of how it all ends
Golden eyes at my bed, we are old friends
I'm surrounded by light
And I have everything but nothing at all
Everything you touch turns to gold
My heart is still wild
People crave to watch me fall
Everything you touch turns to gold
It took some time to discover where to begin
After you please my soul
And peel back my skin
I'm surrounded by light
And I have everything but nothing at all
Everything you touch turns to gold
My heart is still wild
People crave to watch me fall
Everything you touch turns to gold
It's the little things that make you grow
Like in this sense of mystery I start to glow
I'm surrounded by light
And I have everything but nothing at all
Everything you touch turns to gold
My heart is still wild
People crave to watch me fall
Everything you touch turns to gold
I'm surrounded by light
I have everything but nothing at all
Everything I touch turns to gold
My heart is still wild
People crave to watch me fall
Everything I touch turns to gold
Turns to gold
