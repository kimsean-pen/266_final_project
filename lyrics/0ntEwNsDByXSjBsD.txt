As you brush your shoes
Stand before the mirror
& you comb your hair
Grab your coat & hat

& you walk
Wet streets tryin' to remember
All the wild night breezes in your
Memory ever

& everything looks so complete
When you're walkin' out on the street
& the wind catches your feet
Sends you flyin', cryin'

Ooh, woo, wee
Wild night is calling, alright
Ooh, woo, wee
Wild night is calling

All the girls walk by
Dressed up for each other
& the boys do the boogie-woogie
On the corner of the street

& the people passin' by
Stare in wild wonder
& the inside jukebox
Roars out just like thunder

& everything looks so complete
When you walk out on the street
& the wind catches your feet
& sends you flyin', cryin'

Woo, woo, wee
Wild night is calling, alright
Ooh, woo, wee
Wild night is calling, alright

Well, the wild night is calling
The wild night is calling

Come on out & dance
Whoa, come on out & make romance
Yes, indeed
Come on out & dance
Come on out, make romance
The wild night is calling, alright
The wild night is calling
Come on out & dance
Yeah, come on out & make romance
Come on out & dance, alright
Come on out & make romance
