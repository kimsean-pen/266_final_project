What did I do to deserve such a fate
I didn't really want to get
Involved in this thing
Someone handed me this gun and I
I gave it everything
Yeah, I gave it everything

I came into this life
Looked all around
I saw just what I liked
And took what I found
Nothing came easy
Nothing came free
Nothing came all until they
Came after me

Yeah-hey, yeah

(What did I do to deserve such a fate?)
(I gave it everything)
(Now I need to escape)
(Someone near me, calling my name)
(I gave it everything)
(I gave it everything)

Miles and miles...
