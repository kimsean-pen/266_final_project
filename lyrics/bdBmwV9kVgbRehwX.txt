baby tell me what you're trying to prove
playing games with my heart
hey now listen, i ain't gonna take one more night
you're the one who broke the rules
and i'm the one who played the fool
now you're trying to tell me it's alright
you should know better than to hurt a friend
you'll never get another chance again
you'll be back where you started
i know you won't admit it but you're broken-hearted
back where you started
you think it's gonna be easy but it just gets harder, harder
you had a way with words
one look and i was under your spell
i didn't know should i stay or should i run
you can't deny you told me lies
love'em and leave'em baby, that's your style
i'm not affraid to take life as it comes
you play with fire i guess you'll never learn
you mess with me babe, you 're gonna get burned
you'll be back where you started
i know how it feels when you've been discarded
back where you started
you think you got it made but it won't get you far, no it won't get you far
who's gonna help ya, throw you a lifetime
i'll tell you one thing, you've really done it this time
you took your one chance and let it slip away
