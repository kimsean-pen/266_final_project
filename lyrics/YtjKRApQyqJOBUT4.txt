You weren't worth nothing
I should've seen it coming
you said I was the only one
we were having so much fun
And now I want something
and now I want something
and now I want something

boy then
you I, caught ya

He was the coolest I ever known
He did me dirty so I let him go
Now everything is alright
After I said goodbye
he was getting way too comfortable
now I'm taking back all my control
now everything is alright
After I said goodbye

I know what you're doing
behind my back screwing
coming home late at night (night)
doing things i would've spite
and now I want something
and now I want something
and now I want something

boy then
you I, caught ya

He was the coolest I ever known
he did me dirty so i let him go
Now everything is alright
After I said goodbye
he was getting way too comfortable
now I'm taking back all my control
now everything is alright
After I said goodbye
