It was me on that road
But you couldn't see me
Too many lights out
But nowhere near here
It was me on that road
Still you couldn't see me
And then flashlights
And explosions
Road's end getting nearer
We cover distance
But not together
I am the storm
And I am the wonder
And the flashlights,
Nightmares
Sudden explosions
I don't know what more to ask for
I was given just one wish

It's about you and the sun
A morning run
The story of my maker
What I have and what I ache for
I've got a golden ear
I cut and I spear
And what else is there
Road's end getting nearer
We cover distance still not together
If I am the storm
If I am the wonder
Will I have flashlights,
Nightmares
Sudden explosion
There's no room where I can go and
You've got secrets too
I don't know what more to ask for
I was given just one wish

I don't know what more to ask for
I was given just one wish
