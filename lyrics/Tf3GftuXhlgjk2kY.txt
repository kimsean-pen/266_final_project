I will follow you now
Wherever you go
I'll be with you now
Stick around forever
And I never wanna see those tears again
No no
When will you realise
That I ain't that tough

Save what you got
Keep it safe
Don't ever stop
There's nothing more
It's nothing less
It's all we got
It's happiness
It's happiness...

Ain't that right
Ain't that right

And I will have a thousand dreams
Of how I care for you
Through these careless dreams
Look into the future
And I never wanna see those tears again
No no
When will you realise
That you make me breath out

Save what you got
Keep it safe
Don't never stop
It's nothing more
It's nothing less
It'sall we got
It's happiness
Happiness
Oh it's always been you
It's always been you

And I know you got to make it right
Handing out my feelings
On these goods are too loud

Oh and it don't matter
Yeah I pay my dues
And you know there's one thing
That keeps us together
It's gonna keep us together
Now now now now

Save what you got
Keep it safe
Don't ever stop
It's nothing more
It's nothing less
It's all I got
It's happiness

Happiness
