Run run run
Run little piggy run
As fast as you can
Before your time runs out
Get it in

We all burn out
We're not gonna make it
Out alive
Out alive
We're not gonna make it

I hold the gun
And when I come home it's only to slaughter
You have done this to me

I'm out of love
You can run all you want little piggy you're fucked
I'm out for blood
Run little piggy
Run run little piggy
