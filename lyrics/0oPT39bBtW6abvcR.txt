I can tell by the weight of your words that this is over
All the should've but could'ves can no longer be
This is the second death in the exquisite art of forgetting
and i promise this to you i'll burn the devotion clean
Filling every hole in my heart
All of these melancholy moments can sometimes sink
Everything you were is fiction, everything you are is fiction
And if you see me chin down and toungue tied
this is all ihave to offer
I thought i'd never be asking
This is my last laugh in this place of dying
And for you. this is the last goodbye you'll ever here
It's not suppose to end like this
