As I'm talking my words
Slip to the floor
And they crawl through your legs
Slide under
The back door

Rendering me
Freakish and dazed
Well here I am dont know how to say this
Only thing I know
Is awkward silence
Your eyelids close
When you're around me
To shut me out

So I'll go walking in the streets
Until my heels bleed
And ill sing out my song
In case the birds wish to sing along
And ill dig a tunnel to the center of the universe

Well here I am dont know how to say this
Only thing I know is awkward silence
Your eyelids close when youre around me
To shut me out

I'll make my way across the frozen sea
Beyond the blank horizon
Where I can forget you and me
And get a decent night sleep

Well here I am dont know how to say this
Only thing I know is awkward silence
Your eyelids close when youre around me
To shut me out

Well here I am dont know how to say this
Only thing I know is awkward silence
Your eyelids close when youre around me
To shut me out
To shut me out
(dont shut me out)
To shut me out
(dont shut me out)
To shut me out
(dont count me out)
To shut me out
(dont shut me out)
