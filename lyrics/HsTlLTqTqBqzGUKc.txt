Catch Me I'm Falling
Wake up, don't sleep. Wake up, don't sleep.
I lay down to rest my head,
my soul to keep the night I dread,
Real it is no dream.
Slumber comes as darkness falls,
and shadows dance across my walls,
Life it is no dream.
I wakes up, don't sleep.
My dreams become so real to me.
Catch Wake up, don't sleep.
While the night is young.
Catch me, I am falling... down again.
Me I know it is a dream, but just the same.
There's a face, before my eyes are closed,
but I can't recognise the danger there.
I'm Slumber comes as darkness falls
and shadows dance across my walls,
it is no dream.

Catch me, I am falling, falling...
Catch me, I am falling... down again.
