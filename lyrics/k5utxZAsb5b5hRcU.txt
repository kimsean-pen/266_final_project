From lashes to ashes and from lust to dust
In your sweetest torment I'm lost
And no heaven can help us
Ready, willing and able
To lose it all
For a kiss so fatal and so warm

It's heartache every moment
From the start 'til the end
It's heartache every moment with you
Deeper into our heavenly suffering
Our fragile souls are falling
It's heartache every moment, baby with you

And we sense the danger
But don't want to give up
There's no smile of an angel without the wrath of God

It's heartache every moment
From the start 'til the end
It's heartache every moment with you
Deeper into our heavenly suffering
Our fragile souls are falling
It's heartache every moment, baby with you
My darling, with you

From lashes to ashes and from lust to dust
In your sweetest torment I am lost
And we sense the danger
But don't want to give up

It's heartache every moment
From the start 'til the end
It's heartache every moment with you
Deeper into our heavenly suffering
Our fragile souls are falling
It's heartache every moment, baby with you, that's right
