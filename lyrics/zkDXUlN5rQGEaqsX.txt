Why can't you shoot me through my heart?
Why can't you tell me where the ace is found?
We both were broke right from the start
Why can't you shoot me through my heart?

(Test, test, test, test, test)

Just test this a little bit
Keep space for a minute
Just test this little bit
Keep space for a minute

Why can't you shoot me through my heart?
Why can't you tell me where the ace is found?
We both were broke right from the start
Why can't you shoot me through my heart?

We're sometimes literate
Well it takes a vitamin
But mostly not

Well you broke my faith in things we could have left behind
We both think every night we get our atlas chewed up
We both became the thing we would have killed before
We both may take to complaining on the mountain side
