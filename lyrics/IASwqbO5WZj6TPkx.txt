Since this began
I've misplaced my head
(Misplaced my head)
This all seems so nauseating
(Just let)
Just let me sleep
Just let me

Until I
Feel free
I can feel it sinking in
Until I
Feel free
I can feel it sinking in

If you wish me anything
(Wish me)
Just wish me sleep
Just wish me

Until I
Feel free
I can feel it sinking in
I can feel it sinking in
I feel a sinking feeling
Just let me sleep
Just let me sleep
Just let me

Do you hear me now?
Am I thinking loud?
I don't wanna come down
I'm too proud

Until I
Feel free
I can feel it sinking in
I can feel it sinking in
I feel a sinking feeling
Just let me sleep
Just let me sleep
Just let me sleep
Just let me

Do you see what I see?
Do you see what I see now?
Do you see what I see?
Do you see what I see now?
