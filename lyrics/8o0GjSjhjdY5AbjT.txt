Sheltered from the rain
The weather here has changed
But then what's the point of a clear blue sky
When there's trouble on your mind

Won't look back again
We've come too far my friend
And it's hard to tell when this journey ends
But there's one thing you gotta know

We'll be watching from great heights
And we'll observe the things they hide
Fight the fear we keep inside
The more we seek the higher we'll climb

Visions of the clear
Horizon edges near
And I wonder how the high will feel
I'm not cool with coming down

Memories have gone
No past to build upon
But there's finer things to be rectified
So let's live and lose ourselves

We'll be watching from great heights
And we'll observe the things they hide
Fight the fear we keep inside
The more we seek the higher we'll climb

We'll be watching from great heights
And we'll observe the things they hide
Fight the fear we keep inside
The more we seek the higher we'll climb

We'll be watching from great heights
And we'll observe the things they hide
Fight the fear we keep inside
The more we seek the higher we'll climb

We'll be watching from great heights
And we'll observe the things they hide
Fight the fear we keep inside
The more we seek the higher we'll climb
