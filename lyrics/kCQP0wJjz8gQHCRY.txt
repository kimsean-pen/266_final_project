Can I blame it on you?
I just can't win, I just can't win

Two years spent wondering through the loneliest of minds
Can't seem to find a good excuse this time, for me and for this to fall apart
Shall I blame it on myself, or this routine that I've been stuck in?

I've lost count of how many times I've tried to get out of this routine
But it's holding so fucking tight

I just can't handle another day of this
I just can't win, I just can't win

Get me out alive

Oh God, I mean it
These are violent days for you and me
I just can't handle another day of this routine
I just can't win, I just can't win
Get me out alive

Two years spent wondering through the loneliest of minds
I've found my excuse this time
Your words are wearing me down
A constant frown upon my back

I've lost count of how many times I've tried to get out of this routine
But it's holding so fucking tight
I've lost count of how many times I've tried to get out of this routine
But it's holding so fucking tight

So fucking tight

Follow the water
Drain the lake to bring it back to me
Follow the water
Drain the lake to bring it back to me
Follow the water
Drain the lake to bring it back to me
Follow the water
Drain the lake to bring it back to me
