Oh mama, she broke my head
It's been four years and it does not end
Oh mama I lost my mind
but you must've heard that a dozen times
yeah, you must've heard that a dozen times,
today, today, today

On the way to my hotel
I found myself wishing I lived there
On the way to my own home
I still felt alone but I knew that you'd be there,
oh

Oh mama, there's noone else
I loved her more than I love myself
Oh mama, I cannot cry
And oh mama, make me go outside
And Oh mama, make me go outside
today, today, today

On the way to that hotel
I found myself wishing I lived there
And on the way to my own home
I felt alone, but I knew that you'd be there
oh

Oh mama, she broke my head
It's been four years and it does not end
Oh mama, I cannot cry

Mama, she is with another guy
Mama, she is with another guy
