Now it's been so many years
I wish I could say honestly
Gravity don't pull me
That feeling coming through my body
A train under my feet
That's hurtling beneath me

And the worst way I ever felt
Was from this same boy that I still miss
Cause I messed it up
And it broke my heart

And the worst things I ever did
Was to this same boy I couldn't help it
I messed things up
And it broke my heart

Yeah, the worst way I ever felt
Was from this same boy that I still miss
Cause I messed it up
And it broke my heart

Now it's been so long I honestly
Wish I could see clearly
But the memory still hurts me
If I feel it in the morning
A gentle street that's bustling
Underneath my open window

But the worst way I ever felt
Was from this same boy that I still miss
Cause I messed it up
And it broke my heart

And the worst things I ever did
Was to this same boy I couldn't help it
I messed things up
And I broke his heart

So I bite my lip and I hold my tongue
And I wait for the pain to be gone
But some days I still let you back in
I bite my lip and I hold my tongue
And I wait for the pain to be gone
But some days, some days, I still let it back in

But the worst way I ever felt
Was from this same boy that I still miss
Cause I messed it up
And it broke my heart

And the worst things I ever did
Was to this same boy I couldn't help it
I messed things up
And it broke my heart
