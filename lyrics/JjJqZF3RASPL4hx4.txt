Let's meet on the hillside, let's go to the mall
I'll see you in the basement with the dogs
Let's dance at the disco, we'll dance til we wheeze
I promise I'll survive it once you leave

In the night I find I know euphoria
Soon the tide will fall to my dystopia

Was it my invocation? Are you hearing my songs?
Send the toad to go swimming with the frog
Please don't use too much energy, this is my joie de vivre
I can bask in the moonlight while you sleep
Was that you in the parking lot? I think all the time
I'm here for your family, you were mine
I gave you a blanket, heard about your guitar
We will make it together where you are

In the night I find I know euphoria
Soon the tide will fall to my dystopia
In this place we can defy mortality
Lead me to survive this unreality

Oh don't be afraid of my emotions, no
It isn't that I, isn't that I'm sad
I'm just overwhelmed to finally be with you, love
You should know I get tearful when I'm glad
These new memories heal my little heart so so
Please visit, I'm missing my friend
Feels like it's been a million lifetimes
Is that too unreasonable to ask?
And I just want to dedicate my life here, so
Tell me how I tell me how I can
I can already feel it start to wane again
Is it too unreasonable to wax?
