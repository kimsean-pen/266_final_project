And last night I dreamed about two girls, bisexual
They was tryin' things, trisexual
Then I woke up in a city where
The population match the death toll

Millions chasin' go to sleep wake up continuated
Life of a Don, Sean Don sippin', never had a palm readin'
Always had my palms itchin' time to get it

Even when I got it, watch me get it like I don't
