It's a cold night for alligators
It's a cold night for dogs
The dogs choke on their barking
When they see alligator persons in the bog and fog

It's a cold night for alligators
When men turn into them in the night
It's a cold night for alligators
It's a cold night for their might

It's a cold night for alligators
Hiding behind the trees with moss
Forever hear the swamp birds screaming
Forever in loss

It's a cold night for alligators
In the blend
It's a cold night for alligators
A perfect monster has no end
