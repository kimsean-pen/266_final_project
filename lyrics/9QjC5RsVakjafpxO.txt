Hey, Rusty
Come hold Luther's hand,
It's deja-vu
It's not like I planned,
Looks I'm going
Where I've already been,
I'm going down the drain again

Is this really worth it?
I got a prison cough
A three-headed monster
Cut Denny's head right off

You can't be too chill
you can't be too zen
I'm going down the drain again
I'm going down the drain again
I'm going down the drain again

Up the hill to have him killed
And he still hadn't died
He talked awhile and walked six mile
Down to riverside
