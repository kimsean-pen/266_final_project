So this is the age of the train
All aboard for the labour exchange
My mind is running away with me
I'm a shop on a sales campaign
Trapped behind yellow cellophane
My mind is running away with

Everything I ever loved
Comes knocking at my head
What you thought was way too much
Is not enough

They tell you day after day
To make your way through the factory gates
What you make at the factory floor
You take straight to the company store
They tell you day after day
To make your way through the factory gates
'Till they can't break your will anymore
You are contractualy tied to death's door

I never left the town I was made in
With this world I'm Michael Palin
My mind is running away with me
I record every one of my failings
I tie your bread bags onto the railings
My mind is running away with

Everything you've ever loved
Comes knocking at your door
What you thought was way too much
Is not enough

They tell you day after day
To make your way through the factory gates
What you make at the factory floor
You take straight to the company store
They tell you day after day
To make your way through the factory gates
'Till they can't break your will anymore
You are contractualy tied to death's door

Not enough
Not enough
I want wider than this island
Not enough
Not enough
I want brighter than a diamond

But everything you've ever known
Is in this city walls
What you thought was way too much
Is not enough
It's not enough
When you thought it's way too much
It's not enough

They tell you day after day
To make your way through the factory gates
What you make on the factory floor
You take straight to the company store
They tell you day after day
To make your way through the factory gates
'Till they can't break your will anymore
You are contractualy tied to death's door
'Till they can't break your will anymore
You are contractualy tied to death's door
