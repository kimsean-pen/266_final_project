I'd sell your heart to the junk-man baby for a buck, for a buck!
If you're looking for someone To pull you out of that ditch You're out of luck, you're out of luck
The ship is sinking, the ship is sinking, the ship is sinking
There's a leak, there's a leak In the boiler room,
The poor, the lame, the blind
Who are the ones left in charge?
Killers, thieves and Lawyers
God's away, God's away, God's away
On Business. Business.
God's away, God's away, God's away
On Business. Business.

Digging up the dead with A shovel and a pick It's a job, it's a job
Bloody moon rising with A plague and a flood Join the mob, join the mob
It's all over, it's all over, it's all over
There's a leak, there's a leak, In the boiler room
The poor, the lame, the blind
Who are the ones that we kept in charge?
Killers, thieves, and lawyers
God's away, God's away, God's away
On Business. Business.
God's away, God's away,
On Business. Business.

[Instrumental Break]

Goddamn ther's always such A big temptation To be good, To be good
Tere's always free cheddar in A mousetrap, baby It's a deal, it's a deal
God's away, God's away, God's away
On Business. Business.
God's away, God's away, God's away
On Business. Business.
I narrow my eyes like a coin slot baby,
Let her ring, let her ring
God's away, God's away,
God's away on Business.
Business...
