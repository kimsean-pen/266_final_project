Any more lazy
He wont eat or speak
Running, raving, headless leading
little horned animal

They will burn in poison
Forget everything
Ruotten, raving, headless leading
Animal is homeless

Round head, so big
He's here to pull their eyes out now, for the picking
My god, it's all remaining

My man, so big
Keeps me here to pulverize, I'm down, for the many
My god, it's all remaining
