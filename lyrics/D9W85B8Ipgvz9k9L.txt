I take the bus to town
Sitting in the back and talk to no one
I got the high heels on
I go out dancing all by my own

People are pushing by
Somebody always tries to cut in line
Soon as I get inside
I loose myself in the blinding lights

Now what?
Your jaw has dropped,
Until the music stop, you know
I still run this thing like a dancehall queen
I really don't want no hassle

Now what?
Your jaw has dropped,
Until the music stop, you know
I still run this thing like a dancehall queen
I really don't want no hassle

I got them hypnotized
I get another shout out on the mic
Peep me at all you like
I came to dance not to socialize

Riddim goes boom boom boom
Sleng teng drops with the... Yeah
People all gather around
Rocking to the beat the queen will be crowned

Now what?
Your jaw has dropped,
Until the music stop, you know
I still run this thing like a dancehall queen
I really don't want no hassle

Now what?
Your jaw has dropped,
Until the music stop, you know
I still run this thing like a dancehall queen
I really don't want no hassle

I go down low like shiwow
Shiwow wow wow
Wind my hips will slow like shiwow
Shiwow wow wow

I go down low like shiwow
Shiwow wow wow
Wind my hips will slow like shiwow
Shiwow wow wow

Now what?
Your jaw has dropped,
Until the music stop, you know
I still run this thing like a dancehall queen
I really don't want no hassle

Now what?
Your jaw has dropped,
Until the music stop, you know
I still run this thing like a dancehall queen
I really don't want no hassle

Now what?
Your jaw has dropped,
Until the music stop, you know
I still run this thing like a dancehall queen
I really don't want no hassle
