Into your head, into your mind
Out of your soul, race through your veins
You can't escape, you can't escape

Into your life, into your dreams
Out of the dark, sunlight again
You can't explain, you can't explain

Can You feel it, can you feel it
Rushin' through your hair
Rushin' through your head
Can you feel it, can you feel it

Don't let nobody tell you, your life is over
Be every color that you are
Into the rush now
You don't have to know how
Know it all before you'll try

Pulling you in, spinning you 'round
Lifting your feet right off the ground
You can't believe it's happening now

Can You feel it, can you feel it
Rushin' through your hair
Rushin' through your head
Can you feel it, can you feel it

Don't let nobody tell you, your life is over
Be every color that you are
Into the rush now
You don't have to know how
Know it all before you'll try

It takes you to another place
imagine everything you can
All the colors start to blend
Your system overloads again
Can You feel it?

Don't let nobody tell you, your life is over
Be every color that you are
Into the rush now
You don't have to know how
Know it all before you'll try

Don't let nobody tell you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't let nobody tell you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't let nobody tell you, your life is over
Be every color that you are
Into the rush now
You don't have to know how
Know it all before you'll try

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
