I'm counting the days since I began to live without you
I'm covered in rain but it feels just like it's the sun
And it don't get me down, don't come around
You're better off leaving town
I'm fine here alone now without you

Hey!
I'm screaming at you
Hey!
Don't care enough to write you a letter now that I'm doing better alone
Hey!
I'm screaming at you
Hey!
Don't care enough to write you a letter now that I'm doing better
Better off without you

You're stuck in a world of make-believe and I can see it
I gave it a chance, she must be crazy not to leave
You're never gonna bring me down, don't come around
You're better off leaving town
I'm fine here alone now without you

Hey!
I'm screaming at you
Hey!
Don't care enough to write you a letter now that I'm doing better alone
Hey!
I'm screaming at you
Hey!
Don't care enough to write you a letter now that I'm doing better
Better off without you

Giving it up, now you're taking away
All of the time, now get out of my way
Never been lost in anyone, it's me they want
Without you I'm insane
So hear me now, screaming out your name

Hey!
I'm screaming at you
Hey!
Don't care enough to write you a letter now that I'm doing better alone
Hey!
I'm screaming at you
Hey!
Don't care enough to write you a letter now that I'm doing better
Better off without you

Better off without you
'Cause I'm better off without you
I'm screaming at you
Hey!
Don't care enough to write you a letter now that I'm doing better
Better off without you
