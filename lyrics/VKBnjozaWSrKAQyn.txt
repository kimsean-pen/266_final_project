I never lie
To myself
Tonight

Rose tinted eyes
Colour my sorrow
A shade of wine

Bye bye black balloon
See you real soon
Wave bye bye
Bye bye

Oh why you so sad?
What have they done?
Forget those mindless baboons
They're off playing god

Copy cats in cheap suits
Are playing it safe
While cannibals of bad news
Consume a parade

Is it wonderful?

Kalopsia
Kalopsia
Kalopsia

Kalopsia
Kalopsia

Far, far from shore
Land of nightmares
Gone forever more

And I love you more
Than I can control
I don't even try
Why would I?

Oh why the long face?
You've got it all wrong
Forget the rat in the race
We'll choke chain them all

Fates favour the ones
Who help themselves
The rest feel the sting of the lash
As they row (as they row) the boat (the boat)
(To Hell) To Hell
Row
