I hate when you say
That I don't blow you away
I can't break thru' that way
Our friends told us

We wouldn't last for the week
I guess they think that I'm a freak
They hated my blue streak
I can't control this

Why does it feel like it's raining in my head?
I don't understand
Why are you always complaining about me?
You don't even know who I am

Don't think I wanna know you
I'm tired of running after you
I won't send you sorry cards
'Cos I don't need to

I'm giving up and I'll never reminisce
I've found a way of getting over this
I let go in every way
'Cos I don't need you

I feel that it's time
For me to draw the line
(I know that I'll be fine)
Without your bitching

'Cos every day I become
A little less numb
Like I don't even know you

Why does it feel like it's raining in my head?
I don't understand
Why are you always complaining about me?
You don't even know who I am

Don't think I wanna know you
I'm tired of running after you
I won't send you sorry cards
'Cos I don't need to

I'm giving up and I'll never reminisce
I've found a way of getting over this
I let go in every way
'Cos I don't need you

Don't think I wanna know you
I'm tired of running after you
I won't send you sorry cards
'Cos I don't need to

I'm giving up and I'll never reminisce
I've found a way of getting over this
I let go in every way
'Cos I don't need you, 'cos I don't need you

Don't think I wanna know
I've gotta go before I go crazy
I let go in every way
'Cos anyway I know that you hate me

Don't think I wanna know
I've gotta go before I go crazy
I let go in every way
'Cos anyway I know that you hate me

Don't think I wanna know
I've gotta go before I go crazy
I let go in every way
'Cos anyway I know that you hate me
