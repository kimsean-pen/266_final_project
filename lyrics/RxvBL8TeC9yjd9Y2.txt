Love is in the eyes of the beholder, I
Used to keep a lighthouse lit for you
Hoping there's a chance you would stay sober and
Find your way back home without the booze
In this deep hole of shame, I've got secrets buried
In this deep hole of shame, there is no one to call

Love is in the eyes of the beholder, I've
Kept the clouds, a distance from the blue
Hoping there's a chance we'd change it over
Picking up the pieces and make do

Love is in the eyes of the beholder, I
Used to keep a lighthouse lit for you
Hoping there's a chance you would stay sober but,
It's not up to me to guide you through

Na na na na na, na na na na na
We were fighting but it's over now
Picking pieces off the ground
Once so reckless but I'm older now
Picking pieces off the ground

Picking pieces, picking pieces off the ground
