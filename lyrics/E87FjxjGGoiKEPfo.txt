I'm talkin' loud in deep ocean
I meant to be like this since I'm here
Do they even pay attention to hear me as I am, as I am
They never stand for what their believing
They say it's okay to be silent
If it's fine why would they judge me like they know me
Anyway you're not gon' take me as I am
I'm fine with livin' yeah I'm fine with arguing
But no one can change me and I'm still gon' be here
I'm not like the others but I'm fine with livin'
Yeah no one can be me I'm still gon' be here as I am
As I am, as I am, as I am
I've been walkin' on the same road
So young since I was 9 years old
Did they let me be or let me fly as I am, as I am
I always wondered why it gets lonely and lonelier
I won but never felt so good I guess
I'm learning lotta things but what I know
Anyway you're not gon' take me as I am
I'm fine with livin' I'm fine with arguing
But no one can change me and I'm still gon' be here
I'm not like the others but I'm fine with livin'
Yeah no one can be me I'm still gon' be here as I am
I'm fine with livin' I'm fine with arguing
But no one can change me and I'm still gon' be here
I'm not like the others but I'm fine with livin'
Yeah no one can be me I'm still gon' be here as I am
As I am, as I am, as I am
As I am, as I am
