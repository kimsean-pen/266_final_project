Club-foot cripple's withered stride
Disturbs the dust of barren tide.
Lifetime spun from martial pride
Graft of scars on calloused hide.

Weathered vet of many campaigns
Knuckles grip anew the reigns.
Charger harnessed - standard raised.
Sombre stroke to crown aspire.

Drown fears in void of infernal Styx.
Warrior's doubt in terror cicatrix.
Drown the sound of doom in cobalt depths.
Submerge grief in the Ocean of Wounds.

In hateful breeze the guillotine hum
Of axe descent to nape of scum.
Wed to pain, to horror numb.
Crimson world will soften the slum.

Short cuts burn when u seek fire.
Bone-deep become the demon sired.
Strong through trials, torments dire.
Sombre stroke to crown aspire.

Drown fears in void of infernal Styx.
Warrior's doubt in terror cicatrix.
Drown the sound of doom in cobalt depths.
Submerge grief in the Ocean of Wounds.
