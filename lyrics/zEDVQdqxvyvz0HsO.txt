You swore you'd never be them
You're just like them
You're just like them now
All the times you said you hate them
Just to hurt them
You're just like them
You're just like them now
Such a cold place that you live in
When you blame them
You're just like them
Still the stars shine down on your skin
Do you see them?
You're just like them now
