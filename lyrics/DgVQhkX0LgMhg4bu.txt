Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year our, our troubles will be out of sight

So have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
Next year our troubles will be miles away

Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us once more

Someday soon
We all will be together
If our fates allow
Until then we'll have to mourn through

So have, so have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Ooh
