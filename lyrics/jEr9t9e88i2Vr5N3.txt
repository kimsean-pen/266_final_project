Sleep escapes me
Like secrets
And I dream of your warm breath
Unravel around me
Eyes yet to meet my own
Your lips on mine
In summertime
We'll be just fine
Your hands around mine
In summertime
Lift, purge me
From your soft lies
And I dream of your warm breath
Trapped behind your teeth
Eye yet to meet my own
Your lips on mine
In summertime
We'll be just fine
Your hands around mine
In summertime we'll be just fine
Sweet secrets without you
