Disharmony tolling for our destiny
Standing on the shore
Preparing for the war
So discouraging staving off the suffering

When no one else is there
You conquer your despair
Say its name and find your aim
Death come give me fame

Wielding fire and flame
Sowing your pain
Scorching giant
Victorious shine the gods of the slain
From my burning blade

From my burning blade
Tired and slain

Disheartening smoldering serenity
Over throw Unjust
My heart has turned to dust

So dishonoring lonely spirits flickering
There fell a shooting star
Alone somewhere afar
Cold and grey some distant day

Death take me away!
Wielding fire and flame
Sowing your pain
Scorching giant

Victorious shine the gods of the slain
From my burning blade
Say its name and find your aim
Death come give me fame

Wielding fire and flame
Sowing your pain
Scorching giant
Victorious shine the gods of the
Slain from my burning blade
From my burning blade
Fire and flame
