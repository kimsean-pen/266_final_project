I know you think I'm a psychopath
A Democrat lurking in the dark
This sucks I'm the K-mart soda jerk
Cirque du trash I kept the stash
Of cocoa candy straight from Japan
Hologram Anne she was never as near
I think you know what I need to get by

Something for your mind (Mind)
(무엇인가 정신에 집어넣으세요. 마음에 어떤 것 필요합니까?
정신에 집어넣으세요.)
M, I
M, I
M, I, N, D

I know you think I'm a sociopath
'My lovely prey', I'm a cliche
Make way I'm in my Pepsi-mood
Mama needs food how about a barbeque
For us the bourgeoisie
So carefree, remember when we?
I don't know what you need to get by
