Stay beside the storm that linger in the clouds
Starve inside of me, there's no way out
Like I for anything that burns me down
The more and more I try

I crave
I need
It kills
I can't break my heart

I cry so long
It kills
I can't break my heart

Live within the walls that filter out the sound
I take the best of me, then turn around
I aim for enemy that tears me down
The more and more I try

I crave
I need
It kills
I can't break my heart

I cry so long
It kills
I can't break my heart
