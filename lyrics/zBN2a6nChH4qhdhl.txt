Well, the church bells are calling, police car on fire
And as they call you to the eye of the storm
All the people say, "Stay at home tonight"

I say we are the pigs, we are the swine
We are the stars of the firing, of the firing line

And as the smack cracks at your window
You wake up with a gun in your mouth
Oh, let the nuclear wind blow away my sins
And I'll stay at home in my house

I say we are the pigs, we are the swine
We are the stars of the firing
We are the pigs, we are the swine
We are the stars of the firing, of the firing line

We are the pigs, we are the swine
We are the stars of the firing

But deceit can't save you so
Oh, oh, oh, oh
We all watch them burn

Oh, oh, oh, oh
We all watch them burn
Oh, oh, oh, oh
We all watch them burn
Oh, oh, oh, oh
We all watch them burn

We all watch them
We all watch them
We all watch them burn
Watch them burn
