Caught out running but just a little too much to hide
Maybe, baby, everything's gonna turn out fine
Please read the letter, I nailed it to your door
It's crazy how it all turned out, you needed so much more

Too late, too late, the fool can read the signs
Maybe, baby, you better check between the lines
Please read the letter, I wrote it in my sleep
With help and consultation from the angels of the deep

Please read the letter that I wrote
Please read the letter that I wrote

Once I stood beside the well of many words
My house was full of rings and charms and pretty birds
Please understand me, my walls came falling down
There's nothing here that's left for you but check with lost and found

Please read the letter that I wrote
Please read the letter that I wrote
Please read the letter that I wrote

One more song just before we go
Remember, baby, you gotta reap just what you sow
Please read my letter and promise me you'll keep
The secrets and the memories we cherish in the deep

Please read the letter, I nailed it to your door
It's crazy how it all turned out, we needed so much more

Please read the letter that I wrote
Please read the letter that I wrote
Please read the letter that I wrote
Please read the letter that I wrote

Please read the letter
Please read the letter
Please read the letter
