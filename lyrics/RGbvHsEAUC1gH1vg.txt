There is light on the edge of the dark side
That illuminates the sea
These thousand pretty colors
Will set us free

But how can we, survive the edge of glory
'Cause we are not afraid
We're fighting for a better place
This world will fade away
Awaaay, this world will fade
Awaaay, this world will fade
Away (this world will fade away)

So now we reach
The edge of glory
The edge of glory
The edge of glory

We survived the edge of the dark side
And we illuminate the sea
We are the thousand pretty colors
That set us free

But how can we, survive the edge of glory
'Cause we are not afraid
We're fighting for a better place
This world will fade away
Awaaay, this world will fade away

So now we reach
The edge of glory
The edge of glory
The edge of glory
So now we reach
The edge of glory
The edge of glory
The edge of glory
(The edge of glory!)
