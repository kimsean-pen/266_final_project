Scanning the room, did you forget talking to me?
Talking the loudest, but you ain't got nothing to say
All the perfume could never cover your stank
Why you so fake, and why is it causing me pain?
All of these hoes, all of these hoes

All these hoes, all these hoes
All these hoes are getting me down
All these hoes, all these hoes
All these hoes are getting me down

Say she stay in Bel Air but she renting in the valley
Staying with the gossip, but ATM machine daddies
Tried to help her out but she always taking advantage
You can not stand next to her, all of her body plastic

Don't know how she find the time to be someone else
She got that Cartier fugazi she stacks 'em up
She always coming with that line, "You should love yourself."
Can't even lie to you, technically she does it well

Scanning the room, did you forget talking to me?
Talking the loudest, but you ain't got nothing to say
All the perfume could never cover your stank
Why you so fake, and why is it causing me pain?
All of these hoes, all of these hoes

All these hoes, all these hoes
All these hoes are getting me down
All these hoes, all these hoes
All these hoes are getting me down

Piping up, you're killing
Popping like an assassin
Don't know what's come over me, lately though I be snapping
All these hoes are famous and they don't have any talent
Chasing all the trends, pretending to be Kardashian

I don't know how she find the time to be someone else
She got that Cartier fugazi, she stacks 'em up
She always coming with that line, "You should love yourself."
Can't even lie to you, technically she does it well

All these hoes, all these hoes
All these hoes are getting me down
All these hoes, all these hoes
All these hoes are getting me down (Yeah, yeah yeah)

Don't get it twisted
I'm who this record is dissing
You know I'm here for my women
Live for the movement, support each other
I get it, the problem is petty disses and issues
'Cause there's two different meanings when calling somebody "bitches"
Throwing shade, clapping back, brush it off and don't attack
All the drama make me sad, I got involved now I feel bad
I know the irony is hitting me so hard
All these hoes got me needing more botox

Scanning the room, did you forget talking to me?
Talking the loudest, but you ain't got nothing to say
All the perfume could never cover your stank
Why you so fake, and why is it causing me pain?
All of these hoes, all of these hoes

All these hoes, all these hoes
All these hoes are getting me down
All these hoes, all these hoes
All these hoes are getting me down

All these hoes
All these hoes are getting me down
