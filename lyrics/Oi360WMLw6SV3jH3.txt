I'm just an eagle
Caught in a wind of madness
I get attracted to that fire in your eyes
I'm gravitating
Turning and revolving
I cannot fight you
Flee from your light

It hurts, the joy's too curt
Why don't we reach for the light
It's fun, I try to run
But never feel alive

Love of my life

Endure the silence
Falling
In a void of hate and violence
Kill me, bruise me
Abuse me but never leave me
Stay now, can't you see
This is where you're meant to be

I am a dreamer
Falling to the madness
I wanna fight, I wanna be your only one
I'm hesitating
Burning and researching
I try to call you
You take no home

It hurts, the joy's too curt
Why don't we reach for the light
It's fun, I try to run
But never feel alive

Love of my life

Endure the silence
Falling
In a void of hate and violence
Kill me, bruise me
Abuse me but never leave me

Endure the silence
Falling
In a void of hate and violence
Kill me, bruise me
Abuse me but never leave me

Endure the silence
Falling
Kill me, bruise me
Stay now, can't you see
This is where you're meant to be

Endure the silence
Falling
In a void of hate and violence
