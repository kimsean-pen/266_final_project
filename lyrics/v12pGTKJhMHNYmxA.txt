Whoahooh!
i love you baby 'cause you're back in time
i love you today
your eyes are flashing back a magic sign
the sun comes out to play

i learned it all from you girl
i got it all from you
how to howl the moon yeah
how to scratch your door
i do it every day
come back again tomorrow
you chase it all away

a dreaming beauty sleeping day and night
the sun around you
i love you baby yeah you're superfine
call me down too
a purring whirring fuzzy likes of day
the switching sunlight
i chase you kitten get you every time
funny how it flies

i learned it all from you girl
i got it all from you
how to howl the moon yeah
how to scratch your door
i do it every day
come back again tomorrow
you chase my life away

i hear you purring down a supersoul
i pop in to look
a personal letter yeah a roll
let her tear away
i learned it all from you girl
i got it all from you
how to howl the moon yeah
how to scratch your door
i do it every day
come back again tomorrow
you chase the life away
