The full moon
Is shining like a spotlight
Yeah I could just sit and listen to you talkin' all night
When you whisper
Yeah baby when you lean in
Yeah I get a crazy, crazy good kind of feelin'

It's like Amen from the back of the choir
Sweet hum of freedom underneath the tires
Kick back sittin' by a cracklin' fire
Strumming them guitar strings
And like an old song on the radio
That you grew up to and everybody knows
Rushin' of the water when the river rolls
Windin' wild and free

Baby you sound good to me
Baby you sound so good to me
Mm-m-mm like a melody
Baby you sound good to me

Tell me
All of your stories
And don't you leave nothin' out cause baby I ain't in a hurry
Every little thing you say
Got a real nice ring to it
The way it rolls off your lips

And oh when you give me that kiss
It's like Amen from the back of the choir
Sweet hum of freedom underneath the tires
Kick back sittin' by a cracklin' fire
Strumming them guitar strings
And like an old song on the radio
That you grew up to and everybody knows
Rushin'of the water when the river rolls

Windin' wild and free
Baby you sound good to me
Baby you sound so good to me
Mm-m-mm like a melody

Baby you sound good to me

Baby you sound good to me
Baby you sound so good to me

Mm-m-mm like a melody
Baby, mm-mm
Like an Amen from the back of the choir
Sweet hum of freedom underneath the tires
Kick back sittin' by a cracklin' fire
Strumming them guitar strings
And like an old song on the radio
That you grew up to and everybody knows

Rushin' of the water when the river rolls
Windin' wild and free
Baby you sound good to me
Baby you sound so good to me
Mm-m-mm like a melody
Baby you sound good
Baby you sound good to me
Baby you sound so good to me
Mm-m-mm like a melody
Baby you sound good to me.
