Open your mind
And pay attention
What do you see
And what do you hear
Conspiracy plots
In this culture of fear

Reunite with yourself
Reconnect with ourselves

Facing the blind
A collective delusion
In need my freedom
From this evil deception

I am the enemy
I am the enemy

Powered by thoughts
Of revolution
Building all bridges
Of error
Search and destroy
My sick innerself
To realize
I'm not a fraud

Reunite with yourself
Reconnect with ourselves
Reorganize our lies
Rehumanize our lifes

Reprogram your aim
Rewrite our law

Facing the blind
A collective delusion
In need my freedom
From this evil deception

I am the enemy
I am the enemy

Reprogram your aim
Rewrite our law
You are human
