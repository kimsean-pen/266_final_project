You tried
So try again
You never know

You've cried
You'll cry again
You bare your soul

No one understands you're on your own
You're not the only one who feels alone

We know the feeling
Just believe me
It's nearly morning
Any second now

We know the feeling
Just believe me
It's nearly morning
Any second now

It hurts
It really hurts
It's in your blood

To give
Yourself away
For nothing much

When no one understands you're breaking ground
You're not the only one who can't be found

We know the feeling
Just believe me
It's nearly morning
Any second now

We know the feeling
Just believe me
It's nearly morning
Any second now

Any second now
Any second now

As sure as the night will cover your eyes
As sure as the voices telling you lies
Counting the days that never arrive
Any second now

As sure as the stones that slow you feet down
As sure as the circles turning you round
Always a piece that never gets found
Any second now

All of the time you thought you got close
How hard it is to love those old ghosts
You get the least but you give up the most
Any second now

We know the feeling
Just believe me
It's nearly morning
Any second now

We know the feeling
Just believe me
It's nearly morning
Any second now

We know the feeling
Just believe me
It's nearly morning
