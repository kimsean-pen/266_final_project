You know you look so tired
You're gonna stay up late tonight
Under the stars
I'll put you in pride of place

I'm gonna set my sights
I'm gonna set your soul alight
Under the stars
Under the stars

So let the street lights shine away
Till the breaking of the day
In the morning you'll decay a little

We've led a lifetime come undone
Staring straight into the sun
Like the barrel of a gun
Under the stars
Under the stars

Been waiting my whole life
For you to come and waste a while
Out in the dark
In the emptiness of time and space

Been going out of my mind
I've gotta bring you back to life
You and your heart
You and your heavy heart

So let the street lights shine away
Till the breaking of the day
In the morning you'll decay a little

We've led a lifetime come undone
Staring straight into the sun
Like the barrel of a gun
Under the stars
Under the stars

You know you look so tired
You're gonna stay up late tonight
Under the stars
Under the stars
Under the stars
Under the stars
Under the stars

So let the street lights shine away
Till the breaking of the day
For tonight all of the saints are sinners
Yeah I can feel we're coming up
Like our heart starts filling up
Like it's rushing through our blood
Under the stars
Under the stars
Under the stars
