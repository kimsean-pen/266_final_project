Tell me where you've been to
Nowhere that you shouldn't do
Tell me what you're good for
I can tell you something too

Where have you been staying?
Tell me what you're playing
Hope it's not my conscious
But it keeps complaining

Didn't meet you in an alley
The cats they weren't complaining
I met you in the daylight
Our vision's misbehaving

I offer you my temper
With the hope that you would tame me
We built ourselves a shelter
You will always be my baby

Feeling, keep on feeling, keep on feeling

I only wanna be your one life stand
Keep on feeling
Tell me do you stand by your man?
Keep on feeling

I only wanna be your one life stand
Keep on feeling
Tell me do you stand by your man?
Keep on feeling

Wishes keep remaining
Nothing will contain it
A balloon where they're escaping
There's nothing but a plaything

Moments keep us guessing
And lead us from temptation
But better to embrace them
And measure our relation

I only wanna be your one life stand
Keep on feeling
Tell me do you stand by your man?
Keep on feeling

I only wanna be your one life stand
Keep on feeling
Tell me do you stand by your man?
Keep on feeling

Could this be, could this be?
I only wanna be your one life stand
Keep on feeling
Could this be, could this be?
Tell me do you stand by your man?
Keep on feeling

Could this be, could this be?
I only wanna be your one life stand
Keep on feeling
Could this be, could this be?
Tell me do you stand by your man?
Keep on feeling
