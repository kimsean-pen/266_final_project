There I go...

Thinkin' of you again...
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Everytime I think of you I puke must just not know-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
You may not think you do but you do

Everytime I think of you I puke

I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
But off of the dome would probably be a little more
More suitable for this type of song woah
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I can think of
Sixteen bars just ain't enough to put some ink to
So fuck it, I'ma start right here
I'll just be briefer, 'bout to rattle off some other reasons
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo
Of you on my arm, but what do I go and do?
I go and get another one, now I got two, uuh-uuh-uuh-uuh
Now I'm sittin here, with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did that stupid shit again
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim, shii-ii-ii-ii-ii-iit

If you only knew how much I hated you,
For every motherfuckin' thing you ever put us through

Then I wouldn't be standin' here cryin' over you, pu-u-u-u-u-ke
You don't know how sick you make me,
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach

Everytime I think of you I puke must just not know-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
You may not think you do but you do
Everytime I think of you I puke

I was gonna take the time to sit down
and write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter, that you probably just shred up, yeah
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made stop and think of
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to
A stupid piece of paper, I'd rather let you see how
Much I fuckin' hate you in a freestyle
You're a fuckin' coke head slut I hope you fuckin' die
you get to hell and satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fuckin' guts,
you fuckin' slut I hope you die, die-ie-ie-ie-ie-ie-ie

But please don't get me wrong
I'm not bitter or mad
It's not that I still love you
it's not 'cause I want you back

It's just that when I think of you it
makes me wanna yack-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-ack
But what else can I do, I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I just move on, I have no choice but to
But everytime I think of you now
all I wanna do is puu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uuke
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Everytime I think of you I puke must just not know-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
You may not think you do but you do
Everytime I think of you I puke
God damn it
Fuckin' bitch
