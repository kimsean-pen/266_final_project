Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Well, okay

I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same
Everything is different, I can't complain
Don't know what you missing
Shame on you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Shame on you

Everything is strange, that's just a game
Everybody tripping, throwing it away
We was getting lifted, now we getting paid
Shame on you

I pay the cost to see apostrophes
That means it's mine, keep to myself, taking my time
Always into some bullshit, and out of line
Driving with my eyes close, missing all the signs
Turn the ignition, I'm driven and sitting pretty
Listening to Whitney and whipping it through the city yeah
Man on a mission, figure it out
Putting way too much on my shoulders, please hold me down
I keep my head above the water (Water)
My eyes is getting bigger, so the world is getting smaller (Smaller)
I've been getting richer but that only made me crazy
Mama told me I was different even when I was a baby
That Mercedes through the PA when I pull up, sounded like a concert
Or a, or a monster truck, I'm tripping but I'm falling up
I always said I want it all, but it's not enough
O-kay

I'm always saying I won't change but
I ain't the same
Everything is different, I can't complain
Don't know what you missing
Shame on you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Shame on you
Everything is strange, that's just a game
Everybody tripping, throwing it away
We was getting lifted, now we getting paid
Shame on you

We only just begun
No, we don't wanna hurt your feelings
I was only just begun
No, we don't wanna
Hurt (Hurt)
Feelings (Feelings)

Down go the system, long live the king
Turn the power off and get your water from the spring
I'm bringing everyone with me when shit get iffy
I give a hundred and fifty percent
'This, this shit that I'm dealing with, but wish I forget
Used to be feeling depressed,
Now that I'm living and I'm feeling obsessed
Yes, high in Jacuzzi's I been hitting the jets
I'm showing her some love she been giving me sex
Bless bless bless
Respect the outline, don't fuck around and be a victim of your pride
Why you lying? (Why you lying?)
Tell the truth and step aside
I don't got the time to let it slide (Yep)
I'm too grounded, push whips, that move mountains
New crib, blue fountains
These are my surroundings
I've been going through it, you just go around it
But it's really not that different when you think about it

I'm always saying I won't change but
I ain't the same
Everything is different, I can't complain
Don't know what you missing
Shame on you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Shame on you

Everything is strange, that's just a game
Everybody tripping, throwing it away
We was getting lifted, now we getting paid
Shame on you

Hurt
