You ever get that feeling? (Yeah)
You don't know what to do? (Yeah)
'Cause every single moment feels
Like life is fuck'n over you! (No)

Don't you hate that feeling? (Yeah)
Can't fight it so you just pretend (No)
That it doesn't really exist
And soon it's all gonna end (it never ends!)

So you put that fake smile back on you face
And say that everything is all ok (No)
But all you really want to do
Is tell them all to get that fuck away! (Get that fuck away!)

Self fulfilled prophesy
Sippin' from the insanitea

Damn I hate that feeling (Yeah)
And here it comes again (No)
It feasts hope and reason
Keep pulling me closer to the end (When's it gonna end?)

Drowning in our agony
Sippin' from the insanitea

Damn I hate that feeling
And here it comes again!
Damn I hate that feeling
When's it gonna end?

Disappointments rising (Yeah)
Right before my eyes (No)
Anxiety is charging
Driven by the lines (Fuck'n lies)

Wicked like that nightmare
Destruction just for fun (No)
No one never understands
A single thing I've done (No)

Cycosematic insanity
'Cause everybody is fuck'n with me
Everybody keeps fuck'n with me
Sippin' from the insanitea

Looking past the future (No future)
Dead between the eyes (Rest in peace)
Everyone is triggered (Boom)
Your victims of your own lies (It's all lies!)

Damn I hate that feeling
And here it comes again!
Damn I hate that feeling
When's it gonna end?

Self fulfilled prophesy
Veins chained into the pharmacy
Cycosematic agony
Sippin' from the insanitea

And everybody is sippin'
From the insanitea
And everybody is trippin'
On hostility

And everybody is triggered
Self fulfilled prophesy
And everybody is sippin'
On the insanitea
