You looked at me
My blood went cold
You said come on
Who cares be bold
We'll leave before our blood will hit the floor

You looked at me
My lips went dry
You said come on
Who cares we'll die
We'll leave before our blood will hit the floor

You looked at me
My blood turned red
You said come on
Who cares you'll be dead
We'll leave before our blood will hit the floor

So come on in
You're looking rough
You're telling me you've had it tough
So take your hands
so take your hands off my chest

Sit back
Sit back
Loosen your ties
Loosen your knots

Sit back
Sit back
Loosen your neck
And fill your lungs

Sit back
Sit back
Loosen your ties
Loosen your knots

Sit back
Sit back
Loosen your neck
And fill your lungs

Sit back
Sit back
Loosen your tongue
And Loosen those lips

Sit back
Sit back
Loosen your tongue
And loosen those lips

Your silence is bearable
But only in short bursts
and then it becomes uncomfortable

Your silence is bearable
But only in short bursts
and then it becomes uncomfortable

You looked at me
My blood went cold
You said come on
Who cares be bold
We'll leave before our blood will hit the floor

And we'll teach you to die
