Jessica, wake up.
Jessica, wake up.

It's February again,
We must get older
So wake up.
I can't write a song for you,
I'm out of melodies
I can't write a song for you,
But I am asking please...

Jessica, wake up.
Jessica, wake up.

It's February again,
It's February again,
We must get older now,
So please wake up.
We must get older now,
So please wake up.
