I had a song in my head when I met you
But I could never find the way that it worked
When you spoke, it came clear, it was easy to hear
But I didn't need half of those words
Been so long since I sat down and listened
To myself and or anyone else
I've been playing along even when it felt wrong
So I hung it back up on the shelf

Taking over feeling at home with you
Moving forward, learn to let go
It's that look in your eyes that says
Baby, I'm down for the ride
Baby, I'm down for the ride (For the ride)
Baby, I'm down (For the ride)
Baby, I'm down (For the ride)
Baby, I'm down (For the ride)
Baby, I'm down

I never thought I could get any better
And my past only made me feel worse
I remember you said it was all in my head
And I need to forgive myself first
Now I know that I'm not without purpose
And you know that I'm not too far gone
But I hate that try to make up wasted time
And I let it all go on too long

Taking over feeling at home with you
Moving forward, learn to let go
It's that look in your eyes that says
Baby, I'm down for the ride
Baby, I'm down for the ride (For the ride)
Baby, I'm down (For the ride)
Baby, I'm down (For the ride)
Baby, I'm down (For the ride)
Baby, I'm down

Somebody pray for me
I couldn't take it if you were to leave
Somebody pray for me
I couldn't take it if you were to leave
Somebody pray for me
I couldn't take it if you were to leave
Somebody pray for me
I couldn't take it if you were to leave

Taking over feeling at home
Moving forward, learn to let go
It's that look in your eye that says
Baby, I'm down for the ride
Down for the ride (For the ride)
Down for the ride (For the ride)
Baby, I'm down for the ride

Somebody pray for me
I couldn't take it if you were to leave
Somebody pray for me
I couldn't take it if you were to leave
