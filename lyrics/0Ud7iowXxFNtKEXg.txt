Sweet dreams can solve the future
Sweet dreams provide the past
Sweet things within your make-up
These things will always last

These things will make
Sweet dreams of conversation
Sweet dreams of love affection
Sweet words within your make-up

Sweet words of things to come
Sweet words of things to come
On and write your letter
You know it will be better anyhow

You're gonna laugh again
You're gonna smile again
You're gonna love again

Sweet dreams are born inside you
Sweet dreams are born to last
Sweet thoughts within your make-up
These thoughts will always last
These thoughts will always last

Come on and write your letter
You know it will be better anyhow

You're gonna laugh again
You're gonna smile again
You're gonna love again
