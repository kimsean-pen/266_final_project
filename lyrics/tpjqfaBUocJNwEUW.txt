One summer night, we ran away for a while
laughing we hurried beneath the sky
To an obscure place to hide
That no one could find

And we drifted to another state of mind
And imagined I was yours and you were mine
As we lay upon the grass there in the dark
Underneath the stars (young love)
Underneath the stars (young love)

Weak in the knees wrapped in the warm, gentle breeze
I, so shy, a bundle of butterflies
Flushed with the heat of desire
On a natural high

As we drifted to another place and time
And the feeling was so heady and sublime
As I lost my heart to you there in the dark
Underneath the stars, (ooh, woah)
Young love

Beautiful and bittersweetly
You were fading into me and
I was gently fading into you
But the time went sailing by
Reluctantly we said goodbye
And we left our secret place so far behind
And I lay in bed all night and I was

Drifting, drifting, drifting,
drifting (And we drifted to another state of mind)
(And imagined I was yours and you were mine)
(As we lay upon the grass there in the dark)
Underneath the stars (young love)
Young love
Underneath the stars (young love)
Underneath the stars (young love)
Underneath the stars (young love)
Underneath the stars (young love)
Underneath the stars (young love)
Underneath the stars (young love)
