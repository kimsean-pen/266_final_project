Wrong place, wrong time, wrong side of the tracks to be
Split lip, chipped teeth and a taste of tar and concrete
Still in the days, head in the haze, somebody please put me back to sleep
Put me back to sleep, yeah
I'm slipping away, starting to fade, circling the drain
It was all a dream, just a bad, bad dream, yeah

Replay, rewind, remembering piece by piece
Missteps, mistakes, misplaced my dignity
I hung in the bend, got out of hand, don't understand what is wrong with me
What's wrong with me, yeah
I'm slipping away, starting to fade, circling the drain
It was all a dream, just a bad, bad dream, yeah

A bad, bad dream
A bad, bad dream, yeah

Still in the days, head in the haze, somebody please put me back to sleep
Put me back to sleep, yeah
I'm slipping away, starting to fade, circling the drain
It was all a dream, just a bad, bad dream, yeah

Wrong place, wrong time, wrong side of the tracks again
Replay, rewind, repeat
It was all a dream, just a bad, bad dream
It was all a dream, just a bad, bad dream

Yeah

A bad, bad dream
A bad, bad dream, yeah

Still in the days, head in the haze, somebody please put me back to sleep
Put me back to sleep, yeah
I'm slipping away, starting to fade, circling the drain
It was all a dream, just a bad, bad dream, yeah
Still in the days, head in the haze, somebody please put me back to sleep
Put me back to sleep, yeah
I'm slipping away, starting to fade, circling the drain
It was all a dream, just a bad, bad dream
It was all a dream, just a bad, bad dream, yeah
