Things are looking up, oh finally
I thought I'd never see the day when you smile at me

We always pull through
Oh when we try
I'm always wrong but you're never right
You're never right!

Honestly, can you believe we crossed the world while it's asleep?
I'd never trade it in
'Cause I've always wanted this
And it's not a dream anymore
No, it's not a dream anymore
It's worth fighting for

Could have given up so easily
I was a few cheap shots away from the end of me

Taken for granted
Almost everything
That I would have died for just yesterday,
Just yesterday

Honestly, can you believe we crossed the world while it's asleep?
I'd never trade it in
'Cause I've always wanted this
And it's not a dream anymore
No, it's not a dream anymore
It's worth fighting for

God knows the world doesn't need another band
Whoa, oh oh oh, whoa, oh oh oh
But what a waste it would've been
Whoa, oh oh oh, whoa, oh oh oh
I can't believe we almost hung it up
Whoa, oh oh oh, whoa, oh oh oh
We're just getting started
Whoa, oh oh oh, whoa, oh oh oh

Honestly, can you believe we crossed the world while it's asleep?

No, it's not a dream anymore
No, it's not a dream anymore
No, it's not a dream anymore
No, it's not a dream anymore

I can't believe we almost hung it up
Whoa, oh oh oh, whoa, oh oh oh
We're just getting started
Whoa, oh oh oh, whoa, oh oh oh
I can't believe we almost hung it up
Whoa, oh oh oh, whoa, oh oh oh
We're just getting started

Yeah, we're just getting started
