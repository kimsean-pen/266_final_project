Never thought we'd end like this
When nothing left to say
When it hurts too much to kiss
It is time to walk away

The dreams we dreamed
A like you bare
That everything we had

Oh, I had love when I had time all
That is left to the space between us
When to fall can pouring rhyme, your rhyme
Oh, that the tears can move to cry
All that is left to the space between us
And I don't want to lose my mind, my mind

And another place in time
You don't love at from the air
With the battles we bought fight
We're off from the sun again

And i'd thought I
The Castasenchase
And only one we amaze

Oh, I had love when I had time all
That is left to the space between us
When to fall can pouring rhyme, your rhyme
Oh, that the tears can move to cry
All that is left to the space between us
And I don't want to lose my mind, my mind

Oh, I had love when I had time all
That is left to the space between us

Oh, I had love when I had time all
That is left to the space between us
When to fall can pouring rhyme, your rhyme
Oh, that the tears can move to cry
All that is left to the space between us
And I don't want to lose my mind, my mind
