I'm afraid that life will run away,
We go our separate ways.
Somethings will never change.
And I can't believe there was a promise made,
That we would stay the same.
How you forgot those days.
I hope that what we once had,
It could still be found.
'Cause you're just another stranger to me now.
I wish through all this madness,
I was still around.
But you're just another stranger to me now.
Away from my home we find,
We've grown to be more than we've ever known.
And all so suddenly,
You stand in front of me,
We can barely speak,
And somehow I want to leave.
I hope that what we once had,
It could still be found.
'Cause you're just another stranger to me now.
I wish through all this madness,
I was still around.
But you're just another stranger to me now.
I hope that what we once had,
It could still be found.
'Cause you're just another stranger to me now.
I wish through all this madness,
I was still around.
But you're just another stranger to me now.
You're in my heart,
You're in my head,
I want to feel it in my...
You're in my heart,
You're in my head.
You're in my heart,
You're in my head,
I want to feel it in my...
You're in my heart,
You're in my head.
