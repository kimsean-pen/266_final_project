So I'ma let you
Taste her

Now we're lyin' about the nights
Hidin' all it behind the smiles
Take a look at what you did
You probably thought that you'd break my heart
You probably thought that you'd make me cry
You probably thought that you'd break my heart
You probably thought that you'd make me cry
But, baby, it's okay
I swear it's okay

Now these tongues don't twist like they did before
It's hard to keep me up
(And you are dry)
But, baby, it don't hurt
Oh, like you thought it would
The more of you, the merrier
Oh, oh, oh, ooh

Now we're lyin' about the nights
Hidin' all it behind the smiles
Take a look at what you did, oh, hey
You probably thought that you'd break my heart
You probably thought that you'd make me cry
But, baby, it's okay
It's okay, Iâ€“

I know everything
