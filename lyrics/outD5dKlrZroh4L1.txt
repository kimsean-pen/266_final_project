I wanna love you but you're not making it easy
I wanna love you but you're not making it easy
I wanna love you but it's not easy
I wanna love you but it's not easy

Sometimes my head bangs
I'm kinda hooked on your scent

A funny trick, a head shake
I wanna peek, I wanna sip
I show a funny trick, my head shake
Giving me a peek, giving me a sip

Wanna do it?
If we do it, it's my way
Cuz how you do it when you do it
It's not okay

Sometimes my head bangs
I'm kinda hooked on your scent

A funny trick, a head shake
I wanna peek, I wanna sip
I show a funny trick, my head shake
Giving me a peek, giving me a sip

Something made a little opening
I wanna come inside

A bad headache, intoxicated
I know I've got to let you go
It goes for all of us
You're not curious
I don't think you should hang with us

Oh, a bad headache, intoxicated
I know I've got to let you go
It goes for all of us
You're not curious
I don't think you should hang with us
