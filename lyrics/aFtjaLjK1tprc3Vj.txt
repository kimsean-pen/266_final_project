It's 7 AM
And the letters I send
Won't follow you home
It's too late to go

Waited all summer to get to you
Campfire outside, we fell and kissed
There were only a few words, said to you
Sun, shade, this lake, one to cherish
Waited all summer to get to you
Campfire outside, we fell and kissed
There were only a few words said to you
Sun, shade, this lake, one to cherish

DeLorean
Saw your name in sand
DeLorean
Make me understand

Serene, clear water, all set for you
Sapphire in your eyes made this turn bliss
There were only a few things I knew from you
Sunset, undressed, your name perished
Serene, clear water, all set for you
That fire in your eyes made this turn bliss
There were only a few things I knew from you
Sunset, undressed, your name perished

DeLorean
Saw your name in sand
DeLorean
Make me understand
DeLorean
DeLorean

Saw your name in sand
DeLorean
Make me understand
