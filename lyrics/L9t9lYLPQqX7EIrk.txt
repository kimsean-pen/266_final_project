I am a prisoner here weave the synthetic
when wrapping up my wrists I don't truly
dream when you're near loosen aesthetics
remain asphyxiated on the paint peeling
back from the door now I can see you for
what you are she drew the shape on the
floor now I can see the full spectrum how
can I feel existential dread, it's my fear I am
eternal hurt me with your mouth make me
settle down whispering the words on the
wind as they blow heartbeat in the nest,
pressure on my chest where did all the signs
of the dissonant go and when they tell me
they pray for me and they lack a
certain empathy the enemy hits me so low so the
circles on the ground make me settle down
hurt me, give me something from nothing
this is the lie that you come from meet me
down in the mud she is the mother and she
loves it when we all hurt each other proud that her children are weak
I am a language that you have hidden in a syllable and now you're
refusing to speak I don't even cry anymore hurt me with your mouth
make me settle down whispering the words on the wind as they blow
heartbeat in the nest,
pressure on my chest where did all the signs of the dissonant go and
when they tell me they pray for me and they lack a certain empathy
the enemy hits me so low so the circles on the ground make me settle
down hurt me, give me something from nothing this is the lie that you
come from my skin crawls my chest
heaves punish me it's the effect of the mara
