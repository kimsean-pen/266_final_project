Everyone is watching
but nobody is watching for you
I don't wanna turn it on
it only makes me sad for you
I know you can play piano
that was just a talent show
I've never known you like I know you
I never wanted you to go

You're on the rocks in a two-piece suit
the dead location of the dying suit
you gave Lawrence a big salute
Texas brought them to their knees
Indiana pushes you on the stairs
your independent declaration sounded too much like a prayer

But I'll wake up and wait there for you
I'll wait there for you

no confidence in Anna

Remember what they said to you
Everyone will know us now
we love you babe, you make us proud
don't come home without he crowd
don't come back to long this town
we always knew you'd let us down
don't come back without the crown

no confidence in Anna
Anna Freud

But I'll wake up and wait there for you
I'll wait there for you
