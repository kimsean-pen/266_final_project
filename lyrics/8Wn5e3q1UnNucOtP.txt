Y-e-a-h...

(sunrise) There's a new sun arisin'

(in your eyes) I can see a new horizon

(realize) That will keep me realizin'
You're the biggest part of me

(stay the night) Need your lovin' here beside me
(shine the light) Need you close enough to guide me
(all my life) I've been hopin' you would find me
You're the biggest part of me

W-e-l-l...

Make a wish baby
Well and I will make it come true
Make a list baby
Of the things I'll do for you
Ain't no risk now
In lettin' my love rain down on you
So we could wash away the past
So that we may start anew...

(rainbow) Risin' over my shoulder
(love flows) Gettin' better as we're older
(all I know) All I want to do is hold her
She's the life that breathes in me
(forever) Got a feelin' that forever
(together) We are gonna stay together
(better) For me there's nothin' better
You're biggest part of me

W-e-l-l...

Make a wish baby
(wishin' it will come true) Well and I will make it come true
Make a list baby (make a list)
Of the things I'll do for you
Ain't no risk now
Lettin' my love rain down on you
So we could wash away the past (ah-ah)
So that we may start anew...

Oh...

More than an easy feelin'
She brings joy to me
How can I tell you what it means to me
Flow like a lazy river
For an eternity
I've finally found someone who believes in me
(who believes believes in me) And I'll never leave
(now I've found what I need...)

Oh...

Ah not to doubt now
M-m-m... make life grand

W-e-l-l...

Make a wish baby
(wishin' it will come true) Well and I will make it come true
Make a list baby (make a list)
Of the things I'll do for you
Ain't no risk now
Lettin' my love rain down on you
So we could wash away the past (ah-ah)
So that we may start anew...
Yeah-yeah-yeah
(beside me) Need your lovin' here beside me
(to guide me) Keep it close enough to guide me
(inside of me) From the fears that are inside of me
You're the biggest part of me

(forever) Got a feelin' that forever
(together) We are gonna stay together
(forever) From now until forever
You're the biggest part of me
You're the life that breathes in me
You're the biggest part of me...
M-m-m... m-m-m...
You changed my life
You made it right
And I'll be a servant to you
For the rest of my life
You're the biggest part of me...
Yeah... yeah
