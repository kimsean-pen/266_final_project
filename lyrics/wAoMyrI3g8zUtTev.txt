Coming around my senses torn
It's no illusion it's here everyday I bleed
As long as you see it, as long as you know
As long as you fake it nobody knows

Break down again
I'm suffering
My head's out of sync
And I can't hide the pain

Is this the ending or is this the start
All that we sever, all that we are
Communication connected apart
Promises given the cross of a heart

Break down again
I'm suffering
My head's out of sync
And I can't find the way out of it
I can't find a way out

Break down again
I'm suffering
My head's out of sync
And I can't find the way out of it
I can't find a way out
Break out
