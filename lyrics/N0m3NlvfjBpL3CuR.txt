You grip your hands around my throat
(hands around my throat)
And you strip the buttons off my coat
(buttons off my coat)
And I choose the methods I do best
(methods I do best)
And the thump thump, the thumping in your chest

When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver

You leave these marks upon my neck
(makes upon my neck)
And they're still there I know but I still check
(but I still check)
And the thump thump, the thumping in my chest
(thumping in my chest)
As I lose the feeling in my fingertips

When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver

Allie you're dear to me
Please check your clothing at the door
And who you're supposed to be
You always leave me wanting more
Allie you're dear to me
Shall we get intimate again?
Allie you're dear to me
Shall we get intimate again?
Shall we get intimate again?
Shall we get intimate again?
(I think so, I think so)
Shall we get intimate again?
Allie you're dear to me (me, me)

When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver
(oooh oh)
When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver
(Shiver)
