In the court yard
use to sing as loud as she could
locked away here
she's been quite lovely and good
but no one listens now
she's lost her voice
she had no choice

if you sing loud and clear
someone passing by
will surely hear you
no you can't be afraid
if you ever want
somebody hear you
if you sing loud and clear
someone passing by
will surely hear you
no you can't be afraid

tour the curtain
put her hand outside
of the frame
let her hair down
sang all day
and nobody came
but when the sun went down
the stars came out
she heard them shout

if you sing loud and clear
someone passing by
will surely hear you
no you can't be afraid
if you ever want
somebody hear you
if you sing loud and clear
someone passing by
will surely hear you
no you can't be afraid

but when the sun went down the stars came out she heard them shout

if you sing loud and clear
someone passing by
will surely hear you
no you can't be afraid
if you ever want
somebody hear you
if you sing loud and clear
someone passing by
will surely hear you
no you can't be afraid
