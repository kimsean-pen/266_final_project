Take one last breath
You're about to jump to your death
You're about to jump to your death

Sail away from the shoreline
Sail away from the shore
I'm in front of Heaven's door.

Sail away from the shoreline
Sail away from the shore
I'm in front of Heaven's door.

Captain Captain
Before the sail rips
Captain Captain
I can see enemy ships
Captain Captain
Before the sail rips
Gasp for air
ABANDON ALL SHIPS!

The current's strong
The waves will rise
The binding chains made me realize
Sin is the anchor, holding you down.
I'm on the cruise to Paradise.
I'm done with sin
I've paid my price.
God is your captain
Change your direction
Abandon all ships!

We'll part the sea.
Choose your side.
Don't come with me.
You decide.
We'll Part the sea.
Don't come with me.

Sail away from the shoreline
Sail away from the shore
I'm in front of Heaven's door.

Oh!

Look what we've built, walking the plank of guilt.
Look what we've built, walking the plank of guilt.
Look what we've built, walking blindfolded.
Look what we've built, walking the plank of guilt.
Look what we've built!

The current's strong
The waves will rise
The binding chains made me realize
Sin is the anchor, holding you down.
I'm on the cruise to Paradise.
I'm done with sin
I've paid my price
God is your captain
Change your direction
Abandon all ships!
