Businessmen drink my blood
Like the kids in art school said they would
And I guess I'll just begin again
You say can we still be friends
If I was scared, I would
And if I was bored, you know I would
And if I was yours, but I'm not
All the kids have always known
That the emperor wears new clothes
But to bow to down to them anyway
Is better than to be alone
If I was scared, I would
And if I was bored, you know I would
And if I was yours, but I'm not
Now you're knocking at my door
Saying please come out against the night
But I would rather be alone
Than pretend I feel alright
If the businessmen drink my blood
Like the kids in art school said they would
Then I guess I'll just begin again
You say can we still be friends
If I was scared, I would
And if I was pure, you know I would
And if I was yours, but I'm not
Now I'm ready to start
If I was scared, I would
And if I was pure, you know I would
And if I was yours, but I'm not
Now I'm ready to start
Now I'm ready to start
I would rather be wrong
Than live in the shadows of your song
My mind is open wide
And now I'm ready to start
Now I'm ready to start
My mind is open wide
Now I'm ready to start
Not sure you'll open the door
To step out into the dark
Now I'm ready!
