I'm feeling myself in the daytime
Feeling myself in the night
And working 9 to 5
Still can't get you out my mind
Call me a believer, don't call my a saint
Better beware, 'cause when I care
I'll do what it takes

I wanna own my business
I wanna know what I do
I got what it takes yeah, I ain't being cruel
Call me a believer, don't call me a fool
Better beware, 'cause when I care
I know what I do

Tick-tock
Guess we're running, running, running out of time
Tick-tock
Cards on the table
And maybe we're gonna be fine

Don't you mess with my legacy
I'm all fired up, I got all I need
Don't you mess with my legacy
'cause I'mma be blowing up
I'mma be blowing up
Show respect and integrity
'cause I'm right where I'm supposed to be
Don't you mess with my legacy
'Cause I'mma be blowing up
I'mma be blowing up
In you face like...

Mama told me to be patient
Pops said I could go far
My parents always there for me
They think I'll be a star
Still ain't really sure who's gonna heal my scars
But I know with my family and friends, it won't be that hard

Oh my my my
Please stop those stupid
Lie lie lies
Am I asking too much?
Just let me start
Call me a believer, don't call me a fraud
I'm gonna show the world who's the boss

Tick-tock
Guess we're running, running, running out of time
Tick-tock
Cards on the table
And maybe we're gonna be fine

Don't you mess with my legacy
I'm all fired up, I got all I need
Don't you mess with my legacy
'cause I'mma be blowing up
I'mma be blowing up
Show respect and integrity
'cause I'm right where I'm supposed to be
Don't you mess with my legacy
'Cause I'mma be blowing up
I'mma be blowing up
In you face like...

(Risk taker, taker)
I'mma be blowing up
(Risk taker, taker)
I'mma be, I'mma, be I'mma, be blowing up
Legacy, Legacy, Legacy, Legacy, Legacy
This is my legacy
Legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy
So don't you mess with my legacy

Don't you mess with my legacy
I'm all fired up, I got all I need
Don't you mess with my legacy
'cause I'mma be blowing up
I'mma be blowing up
Show respect and integrity
'cause I'm right where I'm supposed to be
Don't you mess with my legacy
'Cause I'mma be blowing up
I'mma be blowing up
In you face like...
