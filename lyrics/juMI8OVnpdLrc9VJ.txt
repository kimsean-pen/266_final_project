I just sit and cry
By the telephone

You never call my name
On the telephone
You never call my name
On the telephone

I just sit and cry
By the telephone

I try and call your phone
But you're never home
I try and call your phone
But you're never home

You watch me sit outside
You watch me wait and try

And much to my surprise
I caught you on the number nine
You never called my name
On the telephone

You never call my name
On the telephone
You never call my name
On the telephone

You make me sick inside
You make me wanna die
