And I click
And I like
Measure up
Scrutinize
Counterfeit extraordinary lives

I'm a sick, prototype
I'm a sign, of the times
I fake it like I made it for their eyes
I'm paralyzed
Let's not keeping wasting away
Behind our hi-res displays

Let's be revolutionary
Yeah, we could be so much more
Let's be more than ordinary
(What are we waiting for?)

Let's be revolutionary
New history can't ignore
Let's be more than temporary
(What are we waiting for?)

Stuck, in a loop
See the posts
Read the news
Addicted to the story, not the truth
Every click, adds into
All the ad, revenue
Pay to reinforce my narrow views
Without the proof

Searching for someone to blame
Behind our hi-res displays

Let's be revolutionary
Yeah, we could be so much more
Let's be more than ordinary
(What are we waiting for?)

Let's be revolutionary
New history can't ignore
Let's be more than temporary
(What are we waiting for?)

All this fear
All this war
We could give it all away
While we're here
We want more
Than just standing in line
No more cash
No more gods
Just give 'em all away
Just give 'em all away

Let's be revolutionary
We could be so much more
Let's be more than ordinary
(What are we waiting for?)

Let's be revolutionary
New history can't ignore
Let's be more than temporary
(What are we waiting for?)

Let's be revolutionary
(What are we waiting for?)
