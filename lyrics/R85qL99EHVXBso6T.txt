How you turn my world
You precious thing
You starve and near exhaust me

Everything I've done
I've done for you
I move the stars for no one

You've run so long
You've run so far
Your eyes can be so cruel
Just as I can be so cruel
Oh I do believe in you
Yes I do

Live without your sunlight
Love without your heartbeat
I, I can't live within you
I can't live within you

I, I can't live within you.
