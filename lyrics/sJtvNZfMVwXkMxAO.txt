It's the summer, and I'm at it again
She my lil thing, gets me out of the jam
Do your lil thing, put it all in the air
Show me something, they don't need to know what we do
It's the summer, and I'm at it again
She my lil thing, gets me out of the jam
Do your lil thing, put it all in the air
Show me something, they don't need to know what we do

The heat coming from the sand
Makes me feel we're doing it all over again
Cause it's hot out and it's dark inside
And days like this remind me
Of being with you, being with you
And I might fake or play pretend
And I might say the same things over again
But I'm always down to turn around
And put it all back together
Together with you, together with you

It's the summer, and I'm at it again
She my lil thing, gets me out of the jam
Do your lil thing, put it all in the air
Show me something, they don't need to know what we do
It's the summer, and I'm at it again
She my lil thing, gets me out of the jam
Do your lil thing, put it all in the air
Show me something, they don't need to know what we do

And while I know that you mean well
Sometimes it feels I'm getting away from myself
It's the little things that make me weep
The rainy days in Malibu
Staying late after school
Hanging up my calls with you
Even when I'm insecure
Holding close all over the nights, they were pure
We were just 19, alive and new
My heart can't keep from beating
It does it for you, it does it for you

It's the summer, and I'm at it again
She my lil thing, gets me out of the jam
Do your lil thing, put it all in the air
Show me something, they don't need to know what we do
It's the summer, and I'm at it again
She my lil thing, gets me out of the jam
Do your lil thing, put it all in the air
Show me something, they don't need to know what we do
