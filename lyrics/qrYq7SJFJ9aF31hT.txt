Moonlight and liquor, you make me sick
And baby, don't tell me you wanted your kiss
And I'm a fool to let you in
Yeah, I think I'm gonna fall again, yeah

So baby, you have to prove it
Make me come for you, girl
Yeah baby, you have to prove it
Take me into your world

Are you really in love with me?
And do you want my company?
Are you just tryna pull this fantasy, your fantasy, your fantasy?
Are you really in love with me?

Yeah baby, you have to prove it
Take me into your world
