If you ever hear that thunder, put your eye to the sky, boy, and wonder
Maybe there's a kingdom above the weather
Oh, and whether you're gonna get our name is up to him

If you ever hear that crying in the distance like some siren
Maybe there's a singer with no ring around their little finger, no love
And If I lose my voice
If I have no choice but to go quiet
Won't you sing for me a melody into the night there
Well, if I die too young, if the wolf he comes
Fee-fi-fo-fum
If I die too young, oh, if the locust come
Well then, run, run, run
Free

If you ever hear that gunshot, you may think 'bout what you do but you don't got
Say a prayer, think of mother, I am a rock

If you ever hear that sound now
If the door gets kicked in here, they come now
Think of others, be their cover
I am what they're not

Pray for Paris
They cannot scare us
Or stop the music
You got a sweet voice, child
Why don't you use it?
If I die too young, if the gunmen come, I'm full of love
So release me, every piece of me, up above
(Up above)

Love my mama and my papa
Love my sister, can't stand the coppers up in their choppers
Oh, flying overhead, forty-nine dead
Singing, oh, my Lord, come carry me home
Oh, my Lord, come carry me home
I'm singing oh, my God, oh, my Lord
Oh, my God, oh, my Lord
Oh, my God, oh, my Lord
Oh, my Lord

And if I die too young for something I ain't done
Carry my name every day
Oh, I'm sorry
Oh, I'm sorry
Freddie Gray
But sleep easy like baby Jesus in a manger
Oh, sleep easy like little Jesus, beautiful stranger
Oh, beautiful stranger

If I die too young, let all that I've done be remembered
And I'll sleep easy like baby Jesus in his manger
And I'll sleep easy like little Jesus, safe from danger
Carry onward like some songbird, beautiful stranger
Carry onward like some songbird, beautiful stranger
Oh, beautiful stranger
