Someone taught me how to dance last night
What a mover he was!
And someone taught me how to do it right

What a groover he was!
He taught me all the steps to do the rock'n'roll
I found my sense of rhythm but I lost myself control
When he siad:

Dance little lady dance
Dance little lady dance
You know you've only got one chance
Come on dance
dance
dance
oh...

Someone taught me how to move last night
What a lookert he was!
And someone taught me how to do it right

What a cooker he was!
Now we boogie and we bump until we're fit to drop
And when he gets me doin' I don't wanna stop
When he says:

Dance little lady dance
Dance little lady dance
You know you've only got one chance
Come on dance
dance
dance
oh...

We boogie and we bump until were fit to trop
And when he gets me going, I don't want to stop
When he says, dance, little lady, dance
Dance, little lady, dance
You know youve only got one chance
So come on, dance, dance, dance!

That's what he told me
Oh, what a mover!
That's what he told me
Oh, what a groover!
Dance, little lady
That's what he told me
Dance, little lady
That's what he told me
Dance
Dance...
