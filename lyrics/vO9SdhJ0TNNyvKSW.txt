Hey break the walls
Hey break the walls
Hey break the walls
Hey break the walls

Through the effing unconcious stance
Through the ballad of beaten chance
Turn the sound down
Still hear the road
Let the beast out
What did you come for?
Give me a sledgehammer and give me strength
Watch the world come crumblin' down
Cut me loose I seek the truth
I beg the freedom the freedom of Carrie May

Hey break the walls
Hey break the walls
Hey break the walls
Hey!

To the wild I'm travelling the unknown
Father's pray I to the overthrown
Turn the lights down to be blind at peace
Let the beast out and watch it bear its teeth
Give me a sledgehammer and give me strength
Watch the world come crumblin' down
Cut me loose I seek the truth
I beg the freedom the freedom of Carrie May

Hey break the walls
Hey break the walls
Hey break the walls
Hey break the walls

Kick and scream but for we'll sing
Of a home in bought for you and me
Kick and scream but for we'll sing
Of a home in bought for you and me

Kick and scream but for we'll sing
Of a home in bought for you and me
Kick and scream but for we'll sing
Of a home in bought for you and me

Hey break the walls
Hey break the walls
Hey break the walls
Hey break the walls

Hey break the walls
Hey break the walls
Hey break the walls
Hey break the walls
