Let me love you in the morning
Like today, you'll never know
I'd step this way, I'd find a garden
Like today, you'll never know

Well you may claim that you found me
Like today, you'll never know
Like today, you'll never know

Oh nonetheless,
I must confess,
That I'm the mess
That has been left to save you

Your situation must be dire
Your situation must be over the creek
When haunted we speak
But I can't of left you, I still haven't met you

Well I may fall into your dance
Like today, I'd never know
We may meet with awkward hearts
Like today, I'll never know
Like today, I'll never know

Oh nontheless,
I must confess,
That I'm the mess
That has been left
Oh nontheless,
I must confess,
That I'm the mess
That has been left to save you

My situation must be dire
My situation must be over the creek
When haunted we speak
And I can't of left you, I still haven't met you

And if I ever said too much
Well they're my last spoken words
And if I never said enough
Well bleed my last spoken words
Well bleed my last spoken words

Oh nontheless,
I must confess,
That I'm the mess
That has been left
Oh nontheless,
I must confess,
I'm the mess
That has been left to save you

Our situations must be dire
Our situations must be over the creek
When haunted we speak
Gone over the creek
When haunted, we speak
But I can't of left you, I still haven't met you
