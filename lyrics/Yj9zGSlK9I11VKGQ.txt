Once again roaming those plains of mine
You should not have entered
Control and lose control and rein 'em back in
I howl at the treelines while you see only night

I've built a Wyoming distance
A hole on the ridgeline this month
Every fiber all my life
Why am I the light to your moth

Angrily viewing the horizon smoke
Looks like I'll hunt a little (while) longer
I like it when (the) rays peer through the branches
Then tunneling back to the ranch unheard

I've built a Wyoming distance
Line them up - (it's) you and me
My every fiber all my life...
Made the fence you (now) taste
