Didn't they say that I would make a mistake
Didn't they say you were gonna be trouble
People told me you were too much to take
I could see it, I didn't wanna know

I let you in and you let me down
You messed me up and you turned my life around
Left me feeling I had no where to go

I was alone, how was I too know that
You will be there

When I needed somebody
You will be there
The only one could help me
I had a picture of you in my mind

Never knew it could be so wrong
Why'd it take me so long just to find?

The friend that was there all along

Who'd believe that after all we've been through
I'd be able to put my trust in you
Goes to show you can't forgive and forget
Looking back, I have no regrets 'cause

You will be there
When I needed somebody

You will be there
The only one to help me
I had a picture of you in my mind
Never knew it could be so wrong

Why'd it take me so long just to find?
The friend that was there all along
