It's 2 a.m., I lie down deep in slumber
Feelings are falling downward
I want to forget
Waking up, I hear the way your voice sounds
My heart starts to pound now
To the rhythm of yours
You're so angelic, your words so symphonic
Touch your lips to my soul, eat this sorrow away
How am I so lucky, I found you?

Sometimes, I feel like I'm still dreaming
It seems like everyday you're always on my mind
This is how we stay so connected, so connected
Over space and time

When we talk about all my old drama
You look at me and wonder
How I'm not insane
Every week the days seem to get longer
But you know our love gets stronger
With every word we say, stronger every day

You know I would do anything for you
Sometimes, I feel like I'm still dreaming
It seems like everyday, you're always on my mind
This is how we stay so connected, so connected

Over space and time
If you are feeling down, you know I feel it now
We give each other strength
To make it through the darkness
You take me to a place, I never want to leave

I'm in my deepest dream, I don't ever want to wake up
I'll fight till I die, I won't say goodbye
And I won't let this pass me by
Sometimes, I feel like I'm still dreaming

It seems like everyday, you're always on my mind
This is how we stay so connected, so connected
Over space and time
Let's run away, run away, run away now
Let's go away, go away to some place safe
I want it all, now I want everything
This is how we stay so connected, so connected
Over space and time
