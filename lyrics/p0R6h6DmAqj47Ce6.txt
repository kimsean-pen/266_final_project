We hear you're leavin'
That's okay
I thought our little wild time
Had just begun

I guessed you kind of scared yourself
You turn and run
But if you have a change of heart
Rikki don't lose that number

You don't wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki don't lose that number

It's the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home

I have a friend in town
He's heard your name
We can go out driving on
Slow hand row

We could stay inside and play games
I don't know
And you could have a change of heart
Rikki don't lose that number

You don't wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki don't lose that number

It's the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home

You tell yourself you're not my kind
But you don't even know your mind
And you could have a change of heart
Rikki don't lose that number

You don't wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki don't lose that number

It's the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home
Rikki don't lose that number
Rikki don't lose that number
Rikki don't lose that number
