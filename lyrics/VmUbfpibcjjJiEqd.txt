My heart doesn't pull me the same
Oh, all my carelessness is gone
And you know my mind doesn't owe me the same
But, girl, my sorrow goes on and on

My soul wants to pull me away
But all this hopelessness has won
And all these dreams wanna take me away
But this feeling just makes me stay

Apathy, has it's hold on me

Lonely, I feel so lonely
Hold me, won't you just hold me?
Lonely, I feel so lonely
Hold me, won't you just hold me?

It has taken me seven days
To realize that my time has come
And I never knew that
I was gonna be the one to blame
Why is this taking me so long?

Girl, you know, I don't want to be alone
(You know, I'll never find another like you)
So girl, you know, I don't want to be alone
(You know, I'll never love another like you)

Apathy, has it's hold on me

Lonely, I feel so lonely
Hold me, won't you just hold me?
Lonely, I feel so lonely
Hold me, won't you just hold me?

Lonely, I feel so lonely
Hold me, won't you just hold me?

All these signs try and pull me down
(My soul will go on)
All these signs try and pull me down
(My soul will go on)

Lonely, I feel so lonely (I feel so lonely)
Hold me, won't you just hold me? (Just hold me)
Lonely, I feel so lonely (I feel so lonely)
Hold me, won't you just hold me? (Oh lonely)
Lonely, I feel so lonely (My soul will go on)
Hold me, won't you just hold me? (My soul will go on)
