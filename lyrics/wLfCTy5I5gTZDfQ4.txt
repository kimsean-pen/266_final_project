They'll try to stop the dream we're dreamin'
But they can't stop us from believing
They will fill your head with doubt
But that won't stop us now

So let them say we can't do it
Put up a road block
We'll just run right through it 'cause

We can do the impossible
We have the power in our hands and we won't stop
'Cause we've got to make a difference in this life
With one voice, one heart, two hands, we can

They say the odds are stacked against us
But that can't hold us back, we will be relentless
There's a voice they're gonna hear
A voice so loud and clear

So let them say we can't do it
Give us a mountain
And we're gonna move it 'cause

We can do the impossible
We have the power in our hands and we won't stop
'Cause we've got to make a difference in this life
With one voice, one heart, two hands, we can

We're gonna make a change today
Because we've got the faith it takes
To win this race

So let them say we can't do it
Put up a road block
We'll just run right through it 'cause

We can do the impossible
We have the power in our hands and we won't stop
'Cause we've got to make a difference in this life
With one voice, one heart, two hands

I can do the impossible
I have the power in my hands and I won't stop
'Cause I've got to make a difference in this life
With my one voice, one heart, two hands, we can
