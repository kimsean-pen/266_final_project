darling
i can stay awake all night
but i would make mistakes, alright
cause the body asks so much

sweet thing
i give you what i reach
taken what i had to teach
and re-rendered it with such
with such
with such

o, it don't rain anymore
i go outdoors
where it's fun to be
and I know you love me

i know you do
