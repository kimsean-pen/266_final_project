Hills will be deaf
and mountains will not hear
There be no caves
no corners there
To shade your souls from the fire
To shield your hearts from fear

His W R A T H is upon us
The Flames draw near

And evermore shall you kneel
Before the Altar of Death
Forever damned to the Temple
...of Decay

The skies shall explode
and the air itself ignite
But the flames thereof
shall bring no light
To lead you out from the darkness
of this unceasing Night

His W R A T H is upon us
and Death we invite

And evermore shall you kneel
Before the Altar of Death
Forever damned to the Temple
...of Decay

And evermore shall you kneel
Before the Altar of Death
Forever damned to the Temple
...of Decay
