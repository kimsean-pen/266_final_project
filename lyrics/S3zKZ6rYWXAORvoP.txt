Here in another land giving up all of my trials
Little did I think that you'd be doing the same for me,
For me

Where this goes I'm trailing behind cause
I can't tell myself to stop
To stop to feel
Feel if I like it

I keep telling myself to stop
I hear it ringing
I keep telling myself to stop
Am I already with you oh what do we do now?

Some day it's all over
Will I remember the scenery then?
The stampede we will all part from
So close to my skeleton
Maybe it's foolish to wanna be alone
I keep telling myself to stop
To stop and feel
Feel if I like it
