In the backseat of the car
That you're attempting to drive
Information doesn't stick
You pick it up on the fly

So tell me, can you honestly say that you know me?
Can you honestly say that you've known me now for so long?
Well, you don't
Now you know
No means no

This is the life that I believed
That I would lead when I was 5 years
Living the dream
This is the life that I believed
That I would lead when I was 10 years

Mirror, mirror in the morning
Is a weary old sight
But I won't back down on myself
So easily without fight

So show me, you're redrawing the map
How to sell me, I don't hold it against you
But tell me now how long you think it'll last?
Now you know
No means no

This is the life that I believed
That I would lead when I was 5 years
Living the dream
This is the life that I believed
That I would lead when I was 10 years

This is the life that I believed
That I would leave when I was 12 years
Living the dream
This is the life that I believed
That I would lead when I was 15
Living the dream
This is the life that I believed
That I would lead when I was 20
Living the dream
This is the life that I believed
That I would lead when I was 22
Living the dream
Oh, oh, living the dream
Oh, oh, living the dream
Oh, oh, living the dream
