Come into bed
Switch off the light
Close your eyes
Sleep tonight
Think of all the things we did today

You touch me then, I fall apart
I lose control, the hardest part
I wish that it could be another way

Losing, I'm losing, I'm losing my mind
Ruining, you're ruining, you're ruining my mind

You cut me deep like broken glass
I wonder when this time will pass
Or will I fall asunder everyday?
Sitting here beside the fire
The flames they grow just like desire
Will I hold asunder everyday?

Losing, I'm losing, I'm losing my mind
Ruining, I'm ruining, you're ruining my mind
