i can't stop thinking about how nice it would be
to be bothered by your breath reclaiming mine.

to wake up in the morning half dead to you
unable to find a place to rest your arms.

i can't move 'cos he's comfortable there
his legs tangled in mine
hands tangled in hair.

i can't move 'cos he's comfortable there.
