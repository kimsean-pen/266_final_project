Ohh...

If the sky was falling over us
If the ground below us turned to dust
Would you come, to me?
Would you come, to me?

If the song it had me overcome
The tremble low can sometimes shake me up
Would you come, to me?
Would you come, to me?

Ohh...

If your heart is burning like the sun (burning like the sun)
If it means that you will have to run (you will have to run)
If it takes leaving everyone
Would you come, to me?

Ohh...

If the birds stop singing in the tree
Would you come, to me?
