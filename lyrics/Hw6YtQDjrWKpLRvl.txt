Sorrow in the dark
In my heart in my soul to see
Look at me in my fear
I wait for death

Please save me from here
Far away
Please take my hand
Closer way

Somewhere how far away
I wait for death
Please take my hand

Somewhere how far away
I wait for death
Please take my hand

Sorrow in the dark
In my heart in my soul to see
