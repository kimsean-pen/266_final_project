vailing to an amassment of hope
obsessing over hunger
bloated with passion
of great souls
aroused by death
I sacrifice

inflated with an unrequited toil
hellbent of grief
plugged with the resonant sense of
confused beliefs
aroused by death
I sacrifice

deflected to and overpowering devoid
weak to the sleeping beauty of gloom
tendered with a fate to scour the
desolate hole
I sacrifice all
Diverted by
painstaking
distressed
to enquire
