There is a place where I can go
Where all my secrets, no one knows
I'll meet you there, I'll meet you there
'Cause I don't want to be anywhere else but home

I see myself at 8 years old
I'm on the couch but no one's home
My mom's not around, my dad's out of town,
'Cause I don't want to be anywhere else but home

When will I go home?
When will I go home?

I've seen all the mountains
Yes, I've seen all the trees
I've seen all the water
But nowhere compares to home

Home, let's go home
