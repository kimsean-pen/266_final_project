Yo
I've been writing songs since the first grade
Been running from the truth since my first day
To get big cars
To make big stars
It takes big scars
Better get a first aid
Ha, those songs that were first played
Not hard but they charged me on the first day
I can stay brave when they throwing you the worst shade
The ones with the talent are the worst paid anyway
If I had blue button eyes and blonde hey
I make the magazine on the first page
Be the leading man, if I was less gay
If I was a woman would you try to give me less pay?
I could sing for ya, but you prefer a rap
Ask god why he made me out of glass
Cause I'm half assed where I'm from
And I don't know about you but I think that's dumb
And I think that's dumb
We the backbone of the green city
Never been a model but I seen plenty
Young men and women tryna fit in,
Tryna get there, but skinny don't mean pretty
Rainbow, bright colours in the air though
Colour on the air, but its red though, the proof is right though
But its not fair though, but they swear no
What does he know, he just a scarecrow
Tell me something, why we counting letters if they don't count
That's what the show is all about and they sold out
Take a look at my shoes, take the soles out
Yellow brick road, less travel, thats the old route
My money built a man a green glass palace
Tweedledummy what they call it if you ask Alice
Why they slump, under his green gump, waiting for crumbs
Cause I don't know about you but I think that's dumb
I think that's dumb
Don't find me, I got my own lane for me
Don't mind me I'm just brainstorming
Do you suppose we can sell our shows and clothes
And no big booty crows and our videos
Will a man ever stand for the people
Will we demand that our love should be legal
Will our land ever treat the greens equal
Or will the fight that they lost become a sequel
Cause I marching when its done
To the beat of my own drum
Cause there's a fight to be won
Stand on this post til I'm known
Maybe I'm standing for something that we can't overcome
Cause I don't know about you but I think that's dumb
I think that's dumb (dumb)
I think that's dumb (dumb)
