We can take it cool, got time for you
Got time for two
We can take it cool, got time for you

Someone said that you're stressed out lately
Someone said
Someone said that you're tired of chasing
Well I am

And I've heard
That you're sick of rushing, all the time
It feels like we miss out
What life's about

Let's take it cool
Got time for you
For you

We could go in your tempo, in your tempo (no hurry)
We could do it fast, do it slow (oh oh, oh oh oh)
We could go in your tempo, in your tempo (no hurry)
We could do it fast, do it slow (oh oh, oh oh oh)

(Oh oh, oh oh oh)

On the floor we could lie down, baby
Eye to eye
Got some green and my lips are soft
You wanna try

'Cause I've heard
That you're sick of rushing all the time
So why don't we find out
What life's about?

We'll take it cool
Got time for you
For you

Oh oh oh
(Oh oh, oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh

We could go in your tempo, in your tempo (no hurry)
We could do it fast, do it slow (oh oh, oh oh oh)
We could go in your tempo, in your tempo (no hurry)
We could do it fast, do it slow (oh oh, oh oh oh)

We can take it cool, got time for you
Got time for two
We can take it cool, got time for you
(Oh oh, oh oh oh)
We can take it cool, got time for you
Got time for two
We can take it cool, got time for you
