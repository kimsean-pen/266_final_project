Will you cling to life cause it feels like you know me
Will you drift in time cause you like what you see
You [slake?] my hands and catch my breath
Beside myself was it all just a memory

Eyes closed
Take nothing
Hand closed

I'm the cut that you bleed, take you far away
No living in my playground
Follow me, I don't need no time to stay
Just look at the way we fell
Go!

Come take my life cause you think that you know me
And get out of my mind cause I got what you need
Fly low, let your eyes explode
No use to save me now
Tell me what I have to see
Love lost, it's raging down

Eyes closed
Take nothing
Hand closed

I'm the cut that you bleed, take you far away
No living in my playground
Follow me, I don't need no time to stay
Just look at the way we fell
I'm the cut that you bleed, take you far away
No living in my playground
Follow me, I don't need no time to stay
Just look at the way we fell

No!
No time to stay
No time to stay
No time to stay
Just look at the way we fell

Eyes closed
Take nothing
Hand closed

I'm the cut that you bleed, take you far away
No living in my playground
Follow me, I don't need no time to stay
Just look at the way we fell

I'm the cut that you bleed (far away)
I'm the cut that you bleed (far away)
Follow me, I don't need no time to stay
Just look at the way we fell
