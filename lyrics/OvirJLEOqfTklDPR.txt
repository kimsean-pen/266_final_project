Because my days is a mess
My nights is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness less sex obsession desire with no love
Fuck it my bae is a mess my side bitch a mess my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed,
my side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gonna have to excuse my mess

She gon have to excuse my ex
I'm may have to excuse her pets
She gon have to be juicy wet
If she gon ride on this tune express
I'm may have to excuse her text
She gon have to exclude the rest
And she gon have to tell dudes to
step nigga to the left, nigga to the left
Messy messy on some percocets
Smoking purple veggie that's my herbal essence
When a curb is sexy
Women hurting extra
Because i'm working extra, I just heard a lecture
But I swerved the questions and reserved a section
With a bunch of bitches that prefer the pleasure
It's quarter to 7, I just heard the shower
Water running in the morning dirty devil
I'm a mess

But I'm sorry babe but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts til I get ghosts
And I can hear teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn to XO
Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tip toe

Because my days is a mess
My nights is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness less sex obsession desire with no love
Fuck it my ones my bae is a mess, my side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed,
my side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gonna have to excuse my mess
Yes

No pressure, it's a jungle out here
Fell in love with a stripper
Lord I know she got bills
But I'mma make it rain until she sees a flood of ideas
Got me all up in my feelings without knowing what I feel
I'm a mess
And now she over talking 'bout staying her
And she asks could she call her clan over
And I said that's the shit now we got swollen
Now we fast forward to the morning time
Broken glassed with a bunch of ashes
Make-up and lashes, outta place mattress
Shit happens, 'cos my days is a mess

'm sorry but I really gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't even in ghosts til I get ghosts
And I can hear teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn to petrol
Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tip toe

Because my days is a mess
My nights is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness less sex obsession desire with no love
Fuck it my ones my bae is a mess, my side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed,
my side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gonna have to excuse my mess
Yes

Fuck it my ones
Fuck it my ones
Fuck it my ones
Fuck it my ones
I'm making a mess with all of these ones
Fuck it my ones
Fuck it my ones
Fuck it my ones
Fuck it my ones

My life is a mess of happiness less sex obsession desire with no love
Fuck it my ones
