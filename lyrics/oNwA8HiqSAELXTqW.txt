Same words, same thirst
Just a different name
Same joke, same laugh
Guess that's just your game
You got at her the same way you got at me
You showed me everything I need to see

Even though you're so damn fine
I know I'm better off without ya
Even if you cross my mind
I would always have to doubt ya

I won't believe a thing you say this time
All them other girls told me
How you play your game
Yeah, we know all about you

I know it probably worked for you last time
But them other girls told me
How you play your game
Yeah, we know all about you

Oh, we know, we know, we know
We know, we know, we know
Yeah, all about you

Oh, we know, we know, we know
We know, we know, we know
Yeah, all about you

First off, you should really be ashamed
You won't entice me with that big old chain
Can't have my number, put that phone away
Maybe you should just stay in your lane

Even though you're so damn fine
I know I'm better off without ya
Even if you cross my mind
I would always have to doubt ya

I won't believe a thing you say this time
All them other girls told me
How you play your game
Yeah, we know all about you

I know it probably worked for you last time
But them other girls told me
How you play your game
Yeah, we know all about you

(No, oh, no, no, no)
We know, we know, we know (know)
We know, we know, we know
Yeah, all about you (yeah)

Oh, we know, we know, we know (we know, know)
We know, we know, we know
Yeah, all about you

I won't believe a thing you say this time
All them other girls told me
How you play a game
Yeah, we know all about you
