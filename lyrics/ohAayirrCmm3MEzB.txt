A hand upon my forehead
The joke and then the laugh
Waking up in your arms
A place to call my own

This is all I ever wanted from life
This is all I ever wanted from life
This is all I ever wanted from life

Ireland in the world cup
Either north or south
The fanclub on the jukebox
The birds and yes the bees

This is all I ever wanted from life
This is all I ever wanted from life
This is all I ever wanted from life
But only if they're true
Just some simple kindness
No vengeance from the gods

This is all I ever wanted from life
This is all I ever wanted from life
This is all I ever wanted from life

To share what I've been given
Some kids eventually
And be for them what I've had
A father like my dad

This is all I ever wanted from life
This is all I ever wanted from life
This is all I ever wanted from life

This is all I ever wanted from life
This is all I ever wanted from life
This is all I ever wanted from life
