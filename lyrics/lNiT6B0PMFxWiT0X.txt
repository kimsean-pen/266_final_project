Always wanting what he couldn't get
Why some man would hate of his own fortune
Standing here life's living through regret
Cuz he never realize what's important
Could you bear could you bear my love
Could you bear could you bear my love
Just the same and everything you do
Did you really think that they take notice
They just need to take one look at you
And it soon strikes beneath the surface
Could you bear could you bear my love
Could you bear could you bear my love
Could you bear could you bear my love
Could you bear could you bear
Could you bear my love?
