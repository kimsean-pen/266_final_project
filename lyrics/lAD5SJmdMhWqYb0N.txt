How sad, how lovely,
how short, how sweet,
to see the sunset
at the end of a street
and the day gathered in
to a single light
and the shallows rising
from the brim of the night
too few, too few
are the days that will hold your face, your face in a blaze of cold
how sad how lovley,
how short how sweet
to see the sunset at the end of a street
and the lights going on
in the shops and the bars
and the lovers looking for the first little signs
like life, like your smile, like the fall of leaf
how sad how lovley, how sweet
