(Hey!)
Lock the door and keep your eyes shut
The lights flicker, there's evil all around us
(Hey!)
No one's safe from the nightmare
Cold sweat, so scared, someone get me outta here!
They say you better be afraid
The night's coming like fire from a hand grenade
There's no escaping tonight
Its's coming alive!

I need you to wake me
Wake me from a bad dream
'Cause evil never sleeps.
I need you to wake me
Wake me from a bad dream-
The one inside of me.
You wake me up, but it's still chasing me!
You're out of luck 'cause
This kind of evil never sleeps!
(Hey!)
Welcome back to reality
Its's just as bad when you're awake then when you're asleep
(Hey!)
Just relax you had a bad dream, kinda like a sad scene Hollywood's never seen
They say not to be afraid
But you know better, nights just a breath away
There's no escaping tonight
It's coming alive!

I need you to wake me
Wake me from a bad dream
'Cause evil never sleeps.
I need you to wake me
Wake me from a bad dream-
The one inside of me.
You wake me up, but it's still chasing me!
You're out of luck 'cause
This kind of evil never sleeps!
There's no escaping tonight
No! No!
The nightmare comes to life
I need you to wake me
Wake me from a bad dream
'Cause evil never sleeps.
I need you to wake me
Wake me from a bad dream-
The one inside of me.
You wake me up, but it's still chasing me!
You're out of luck 'cause
This kind of evil never sleeps!
This kind of evil never sleeps!
