She set my '94 four door Ford on fire today
So I took her favorite pair of diamond earrings and I pawned them away
That's when she walked in the kitchen
Full of dishes and she broke every plate
Man she might be the death of me, but I wouldn't have it any other way

She might be my cocaine
She might be my rehab
And I ain't tryna OD
But she's going to make me relapse, yeah

But if crazy is a place, then I hope they've got space for two
And I know it's messed up but I can't get enough of you
It don't matter what we say
It don't matter all the things we do
If crazy is a place, then I hope they've got space for two
If crazy is a place, then I hope they've got space for two

She called my boss and she told him I ain't coming in to work no more
So I changed every lock on every door before she got home
If I would get a dime every time she wants to go through my phone
She might be the death of me but I know I could never leave her alone

She might be my cocaine
She might be my rehab
And I ain't tryna OD
She's going to make me relapse, yeah

If crazy is a place, then I hope they've got space for two
And I know it's messed up but I can't get enough of you
Don't matter what we say
Don't matter all the things we do
If crazy is a place, then I hope they've got space for two
If crazy is a place, then I hope they've got space for two

She might be my cocaine
She might be my rehab
But I don't care what anybody's saying

She's the pain and my medicine
The problem and my solution
But she knows I wouldn't have it any other way

If crazy is a place, then I hope they've got space for two
And I know it's messed up but I can't get enough of you
It don't matter what we say
It don't matter all the things we do
If crazy is a place, then I hope they've got space for two
If crazy is a place, then I hope they've got space for two
