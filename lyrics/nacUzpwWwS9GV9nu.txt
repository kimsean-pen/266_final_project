Baby baby!
Get your boot's of skin head
So you think i got an evil mind,
I'll tell you honey!
I don't know why
I don't know why
So you think my singing's out of time, "but" i makes me money
I don't know why
I don't know why, anymore
Oh no
So come on feel the noise girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild we'll get wild wild wild
So come on feel the noise girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild
Until dawn
So you see i got a funny face, i got no worries
I don't know why
I don't know why
So I'm a scruff bag well it's no disgrace, Im no in hurry
I don't know why
I don't know why anymore oh no...
So come on feel the noise girls rock your boys we'll get wild, wild, wild
We'll get wild, wild, wild
So come on feel the noise girls rock your boys we'll get wild, wild, wild
Until dawn
So you think we are the lazy type, you should know better!
And I don't know why
I don't know why
And you say i got a dirty mine, I'm a mean go getter
And i don't know why
And i don't know why anymore
Oh no!
Come on feel the noise girls rock your boys
We'll get wild, wild, wild we'll get wild, wild, wild
