Seen to sign there, left or right? Waitin' for an open door
North or South, better life, never takin' touch control
In start, I can feel the force just pulling me off the floor
Who dares to come out with me? I cannot do this alone

Hey-ya, you can't get any higher stain 'bout where you are
Hey-ya, take the head off this fight, I know we'll go so far
Hey-ya

You're the reason in my life to move on
I'm no stranger take the night, sing this song
You and me just naturally side by side
Take a risk right here, right no sign on tonight

Never been an easy road, but let me show you how it's done (It's done)
Darker days, I've got to go, let our fly be on the sun
It starts so you can feel the power flowing into your veins
Here you are, you can see them watch or you can play the game

Hey-ya, you can get any higher stain 'bout where you are
Hey-ya, take the head off this fight, I know we'll go so far
Hey-ya

You're the reason in my life to move on
I'm no stranger take the night, sing this song
You and me just naturally side by side
Take a risk right here, right no sign on tonight

You can get any higher
Stayin' when where you are
Take the hands of this fighter
I know we'll go so far
Give a little, give a lot
No matter where you are born
It's a rise in taking a shot

You're the reason in my life to move on
I'm no stranger take the night, sing a song
You and me just naturally side by side
Take a risk right here, right no sign on tonight

Oh, take your risk right now
I give a little, I give a lot
And take your risk right now
No matter where you are born (Ooh)
I'll take a risk right now
You and me just naturally side by side (Ooh)
Take a risk my right here, right no sign on tonight
Sign on tonight
