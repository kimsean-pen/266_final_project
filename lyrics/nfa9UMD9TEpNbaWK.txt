Here in the dark, it's funny how I never feel alone
Do you?
Here in the shadows, away from the light
This darkness under which we hide
Like a ghost I can not see
You're the shadow behind me
You'll be my night light, there when I go to sleep

You'll be my night light, baby when I dream
Under the moonlight, shining on the sea
You'll be my night light, watching over me
Behind the glass, he'll never leave
Let's meet in when I don't deserve to be

Strong when I am here
I wish he caught how this heart soul, shadow man
Will you come for me?
Like a ghost I can not see
You're the shadow behind me
You'll be my night light, there when I go to sleep
You'll be my night light, baby when I dream
Under the moonlight, shining on the sea

You'll be my night light, watching over me
Not the way for us to go
Tell me where to follow
I'm happy to be told
Happy to be told

I'm taking it apart for you to see
I could be falling to pieces
So let me fall
Let me fall into your shades
You'll be my night light, there when I go to sleep
You'll be my night light, baby when I dream
Under the moonlight, shining on the sea
You'll be my night light, watching over me
Watching over me
Watching over me
