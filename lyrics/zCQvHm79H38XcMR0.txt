The sun fell down again last night on my anger
The sun fell down again last night on frustration
And on my spite

And I didn't even cry
I didn't even try to stop it at all
I just stood there and watched it fall

And this is the last song that I should ever sing
Just one more time and I'll shut my mouth forever
