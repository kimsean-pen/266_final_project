When all your demons die
Even if just one survives
I will still be here to hold you
No matter how cold you are
No matter how cold you are

I see the Devil in your teardrop
Take your belief
Make it snow, let go
And wait together until we thaw

I don't wanna be another bullet hole
In the exit sign on your road
I don't wanna be another bullet hole
In the exit sign on your road

Just smile like a rifle
Hard metal in the setting sun
Just smile like a rifle
Hard metal in the setting sun

I was invited to eat the young
I was invited to eat the young

Starting, possession, symbolic firearms
In the bottomless celebrity scars
Starting, possession, symbolic firearms
In the bottomless celebrity scars

I don't wanna be another bullet hole
In the exit sign on your road
I don't wanna be another bullet hole
In the exit sign on your road

Just smile like a rifle
Hard metal in the setting sun
Just smile like a rifle
Hard metal in the setting sun

I was invited to eat the young
I was invited to eat the young

By the roadside all
The bones stay clean
Dump gas in on machine
I will still be here to hold you
No matter how cold you are
No matter how cold you are

Cast out now, don't fire to smell
Earth can't sunk it, can't even know my God
It feels like Saturnalia
Sat-sat-sat-sat-Saturnalia
Sat-sat-sat-sat-Saturnalia

There's no exit planet
No emergency room in this tomb
And It's door only opens one way

There's no exit planet
No emergency room in this tomb
And It's door only opens one way

Sat-sat-sat-sat-Saturnalia
Sat-sat-sat-sat-Saturnalia
Sat-sat-sat-sat-Saturnalia

Blinded by blackness
Just empty shells
In the deafening void of our last sunset

Blinded by blackness
Just empty shells
In the deafening void of our last sunset
