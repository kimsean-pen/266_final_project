If i'm a monster,
I am a willing one,
This roller coaster ride is an enticing one,
On the tip of a continuum flowing wavelike
Through disorder carry me like a vessel to water
Everything you see leaves a mark on your soul,
Everything you feel leaves a mark on your soul,
Everything you touch leaves a mark on your soul,
Everything you make leaves a mark on your soul
If i can touch it,
I can destroy it,
If it's imaginable to some degree,
I can become it,
Like a hungry turning vortex that just flickers to existence,
Consuming bits and pieces until i'm finally extinguished
Everyone you see leaves a mark on your soul,
Everyone you bare leaves a mark on your soul,
Everyone you touch leaves a mark on your soul,
Everyone you love leaves a mark on your soul
Everything you take leaves a mark on your soul,
Everything you give leaves a mark on your soul,
And all the fear and loneliness that's impossible to control,
And every tear you cry leaves a mark on your soul
