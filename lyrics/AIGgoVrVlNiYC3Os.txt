Does anybody know where I can go get high?
Does anybody know where I can go get high?
See I've been working like a dog all night
So I can't sleep, but I'm feeling alright
And I've got nothing to do, so I'd rather go get high

Can anybody here buy this old fool a drink?
Can anybody here buy this old fool a drink?
See my old lady poured it all down the sink
But then she left me and took everything
Now I've got nowhere to go and I sure could use a drink

It sure beats waiting on the next train
Back to that old scene, I leave it behind
It sure beats waiting on the next little girl
Who grabs my heart just to squeeze the blood
Right out

Can anybody here give this old fool a lift?
Can anybody here give this old fool a lift?
I left my old Chevy down at the shop
I couldn't pay for it and they stripped it for parts
Now I just look at my shoes
Oh I sure could use a lift

Does anybody here got a place where I could sleep?
Does anybody here got a place where I could sleep?
I rented me a place and it burned to the ground
I lit a cigarette then I passed the fuck out
Oh lord, what did I do, now I need a place to sleep

But it sure beats sleeping on the next train
Back to that old scene, I leave it behind
And it sure beats waiting on the next little girl
Who grabs my heart just to squeeze the blood
Right out

Does anybody know?
Does anybody know where I can
Does anybody know where I can go get high?
Does anybody know?
Does anybody know where I can
Does anybody know where I can go get high?
