In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
Government is the solution to our problem.

Are you unhappy, girl, in this confusing world?
Where everything you earn is getting left to burn?
If it were up to me, then living would be free
And I can give you that, and I can give you that

They'll take your money into their greasy hands
And spend your money
(They do this to disrespect you)
And take away your land
(I know kung fu, I will save you)

'Cause you're worth saving, baby
Deregulating, baby
I'm Ronald Reagan, baby
I'm Ronald Reagan, yeah

I'll save you, honey, you'll never be alone
I'll save the business
(If you love me, say you love me)
That you will someday own
(They hate freedom, I'll defeat them)

Not like in comics, baby
With economics, baby
With Reaganomics, baby
Atomic bomb it, yeah

Are you unhappy, girl, in this confusing world?
Where everything you earn is getting left to burn?
If it were up to me, then money would be free
And I can give you that, and I can give you that
If you just hold my hand (If you just hold my hand)
If you just close your eyes (If you just close your eyes)
If you get in my car (If you get in my car)
I'll take you for a ride (I'll take you for a ride)

With Reaganomics, baby
With Reaganomics, baby
With Reaganomics, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
(With Reaganomics, with Reaganomics, with Reaganomics)
