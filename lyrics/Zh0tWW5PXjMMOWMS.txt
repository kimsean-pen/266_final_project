I will run the streets and hostile lands
I will touch the rain with all I have
I will breathe the air, and scream it loud
My feet will never touch the ground
Because the days they feel, like ancient blocks
Like when kids grow up, and learn to walk
Because your life is full of pure desire
A place so gloriously wired

The lights and sounds
Oh God, this is such a mess
And it's like our world, and we're the last ones left
And the hair, it stands on the back of our necks
And I swear, it shows
Heaven must be just like this.

Do you see the hills beneath the clouds?
And the stars as trails, to lead you out?
Can you sense the pain thats everywhere
And if you try, you'll never care
And the love you had when you were young
Is right outside for all to come
Because your life is full of pure desire
A place so gloriously wired

The lights and sounds
Oh God, this is such a mess
And it's like our world, and we're the last ones left
And the hair, it stands on the back of our necks
And I swear, it shows - Heaven must be just like this

If you see a light break through the clouds
And fire run like distant towers
And the world will begin, exactly how it ends
When you call for love when you are lost
Whatever more, whatever cost
And the world will begin, exactly how it ends
