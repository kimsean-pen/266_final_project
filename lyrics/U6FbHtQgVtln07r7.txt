From my heart and from my hand and
Why don't people understand my intention?

Weird
Weird science

Plastic tubes and pots and pans
Bits and pieces and the
Magic from the hand
We? re makin? weird science

Things I? ve never seen before
Behind bolted doors
Talent and imagination
Weird science

Not what teacher said to do
Makin? dreams come true
Living tissue, warm flesh
Weird science

Plastic tubes and pots and pans
Bits and pieces and
Bits and pieces and

Bits of my creation, is it real?
It? s my creation, oo my creation
It? s my creation

Weird science
Weird
Weird science

Magic and technology
Voodoo dolls and chants
Electricity
We? re makin? weird science

Fantasy and microchips
Shooting from the hip
Something different
We? re makin? weird science

Pictures from a magazine
Diagrams and charts
Mending broken hearts
And makin? weird science

Something like a recipe
Bits and pieces and
Bits and pieces and

Bits of my creation, is it real?
It? s my creation, I do not know
No hesitation, no heart of gold
Just flesh and blood, I do not know
I do not know

From my heart and from my hand and
Why don't people understand my intentions?

Weird science
Magic and technology
Voodoo dolls and chants
Weird science

Things I? ve never seen before
Behind bolted doors
Weird science

Not what teacher said to do
Bits and pieces and
Bits and pieces and

Bits of my creation, is it real?
It? s my creation, I do not know
No hesitation, no heart of gold
Just flesh and blood, I do not know
It? s my creation
It? s my creation
It? s my creation

From my heart and from my hand and
Why don't people understand my intentions?
