Glitter baby boy
He don't have a choice
I sparkle like toys
But he can't find a boy
Sparkle baby girl
She will have this world
Once her life was poor
Tip the cannon boy

Not a caterpillar anymore
You know I'm her
Look what came to be
A butterfly you call me crazy on my knees
Fuck you expect from me?
Trying to catch me on a flower
Trying to clip my wings
B-U-T-T-E-R
F-L-Y, got an alibi
B-U-T-T-E-R
F-L-Y, got an alibi

She's misunderstood
Grew up in the hood
Was a little bird brain
Now she's fucking insane
Shallow men come first
To see her colors burst
Dancing on the table tops
Does what she wants and won't stop

Not a caterpillar anymore
You know I'm her
Look what came to be
A butterfly you call me crazy on my knees
Fuck you expect from me?
Trying to catch me on a flower
Trying to clip my wings
B-U-T-T-E-R
F-L-Y, got an alibi
B-U-T-T-E-R
F-L-Y, got an alibi

B-U-T-T-E-R
F-L-Y, got an alibi
