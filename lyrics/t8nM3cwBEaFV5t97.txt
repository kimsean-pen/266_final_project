Soldiers come quickly, I feel the earth beneath my feet
I'm feeling badly, it's not an attempt at decency
And if you're well off, well then I'm happy some for you
But I'd rather not celebrate my defeat and humiliation here with you

Someone come quickly, this place was built for moving out
Leave behind buildings, the city planners got mapped out
Bring with you history and make your hard earned feast
Then we'll go to Omaha, to work and exploit the booming music scene
And humility

And we've been talking all night...

Oh god come quickly, for the execution of all things
Let's start with the bears and the air and mountains rivers and streams
Then we'll murder what matters to you and move on to your neighbors and kids
Crush all hopes of happiness with disease cause of what you did

And lastly, you're all alone with nothing left but sleep
But sleep never comes to you, it's the guilt and forever wakefulness of the weak
It's just you and me...

The execution of all things
The execution of all things
The execution of all things
