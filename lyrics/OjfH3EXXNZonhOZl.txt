Snowflakes that fall across my eye
Cannot compare to a dumb surprise
new becomes all
What's all is new
When I first layed my eyes on you

I do not care for the winter sun
Windows and fires all they preach you, all
It doesn't matter
This time of year
Thou darkness come
so quick in time
shortens our days
To longer nights

Build a blue fire and leave this sign
Snowflakes that fall across our eyes
It's all that matters
This time of year
It's all that matters
This time of year
