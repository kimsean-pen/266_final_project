When you find the light to an upset shade away
If you never-never let me go with every melody
And you often were at leaving just my life
If you're really not to tug an end
Bye to my fantasy, me too.

When you need to get another chance today
For a time there is the past, a path with you unbeen
Do you rather like to feel what is my life?
If you're really going to listen baby
At my fantasy, and me.

Don't let me go
Don't cry tonight
Don't let me go
Don't cry tonight

Just a random access memories of dreams
As you're hangin' upon me, do you love melody?
Thieve of golden toys to an upset time away
As you have been at last we have the melody, we too.

Don't let me go
Don't cry tonight
Don't let me go
Don't cry tonight

Don't let me go
Don't cry tonight
Don't let me go
Don't cry tonight

Don't let me go
Don't cry tonight
Don't let me go
Don't cry tonight

Don't let me go
Don't cry tonight
Don't let me go
Don't cry tonight

Don't let me go
Don't cry tonight
Don't let me go
Don't cry tonight

Don't let me go
Don't cry tonight
Don't let me go
Don't cry tonight

Don't let me go
