hey baby
you go your way, and I'll go mine
but in the mean time

when were together
touching each other
and our bodies
do what we feel
when were dancing
smooching and swaying
tender love songs
softly playing

move closer
move your body real close
until we, feel like we're really making love
ooh, move closer
move your body real close
until we, feel like we're really making love

so when I say sugar
and I whisper I love you
well, I know you gonna answer in the sweetest voice
saying my pretty little lady
I love you too, well
there's much room for passion, ooh no no
there's no room for peace
when, good love flows smoothly between us baby
my dear

move closer
move your body real close
until we, feel like we're really making love
ooh, move closer
move your body real close, until we,
feel like we're really making love
