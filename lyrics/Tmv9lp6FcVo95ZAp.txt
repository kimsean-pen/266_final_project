I fear I'll die a forgotten man
Just a number, a grain of sand
Time won't heal, it's running out on me
All your pain, it's more than I could take

What still rages
Will you keep fighting when I'm gone
Through the ages
Will you keep fighting, when I am dead and gone
Dead and gone

I hope to die with no regrets
To leave a mark no one forgets
Time won't heal, it's running out on me
All your pain, it's more than I could take

What still rages
Will you keep fighting when I'm gone
Through the ages
Will you keep fighting, when I am dead and gone
Dead and gone

Bearing down, bearing down on me
The weight of all my insecurities
Closing in, closing in on me
The walls collapse, I'll never face the pain

What still rages
Will you keep fighting when I'm gone
What still rages
Will you keep fighting when I'm gone
Through the ages
Will you keep fighting, when I am dead and gone
Dead and gone
Dead and gone
