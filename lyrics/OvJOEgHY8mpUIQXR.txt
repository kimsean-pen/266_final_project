Once upon a time there was a girl
Who met a boy that said he'd change the world
Promises he only made for me
Vanished into what it could have been

Music so good...
Music so clear...
Music so good...
Music so clear...

Every song I hear reminds me of you
Of you
Of you
Of you
Does it make you feel the same as I do?
'Cause the sound, it seems so good

How does it feel to hear your songs on the radio?
And does it hurt to hear your songs on the radio?
How does it feel to hear your songs on the radio?
And does it hurt to hear those songs on the radio?

It doesn't matter where I seem to be
The sound of you reminds eternally
Rewind it back so I can start again
Play it til I reach the very end

Music so good...
Music so clear...
Music so good...
Music so clear...

Every song I hear reminds me of you
Of you
Of you
Of you
Does it make you feel the same as I do?
'Cause the sound, it seems so good

How does it feel to hear your songs on the radio?
And does it hurt to hear your songs on the radio?
How does it feel to hear your songs on the radio?
And does it hurt to hear those songs on the radio?
