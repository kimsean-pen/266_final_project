ALL TO ALL
Call of forgiveness
I'm like the beat of the hurt
I'm not the only one
You tried to save when you fell out

Call of forgiveness
I'm like the clean in the dirt
I'm not the only one
You tried to crave when you fell out

Try, Wait
You made your life on everything
Hard, Made
You made your life on everything
Try, Wait
You made your life on everything
Long, Fade
You made your life on everything

Call of forgiveness
I'm like the heal of the hurt
I'm like the only one
You tried to save when you fell out

Call of forgiveness
I'm like the queen of the dirt
I'm like the only one
Who tried to stay when you fell out

It's like the common law
Was wall to wall
And almost faded
I've seen the gone to small
The lost of law
The almost made it
It seems like mine to shine
You'll always find the lonely ray

It's like the wall to fall
The fall of all
The laws are graded
I've seen the lies that call
The pictures tall
The lines are made in
It's like the fight to crawl
My darling all you've lived your age

I know it's all to all
all to all
ultimatum
It's like the all to all
all to all
ultimatum
It's like the all to all
the all to all
the ultimatum

I know it's all to all
all to all
ultimatum
Just like the all to all
all to all
ultimatum
It's like the all to all
the all to all
the ultimatum

You made your life on everything
You made your life on everything
