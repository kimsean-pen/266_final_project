You tell me I'm so special
And I'm the only one you'll
Ever be with, and you tell me
You'll never hurt me and you won't leave

You got me bags and flowers,
So sure that I don't know what
Every thing you've got goin' on,
Never think that I might be onto you

Boy, you've got me wrong
'Cause you are not that strong
Shut up and read my lips
'Cause boy, you make me sick
And I know what you do
I've had enough
You can keep her, just keep her, yeah
'Cause I don't want you

I've seen what you've been up to,
I must say I'm surprised you
Ever thought you could fool me babe,
See, clever ladies don't play this game
You think that you outsmart me,
You think I'm not, or was she?
Never called you when I'm at home
Ever call you the next time you're alone?

Boy, you've got me wrong
'Cause you are not that strong
Shut up and read my lips
'Cause boy, you make me sick
And I know what you do
I've had enough,
You can keep her, just keep her, yeah
'Cause I don't want you

'Cause I don't want you
See, I don't need you
She can have you
'Cause I don't want to

You tell me I'm so special
And I'm the only one you'll
Ever be with and you tell me
You'll never hurt me and you won't leave me, no

Boy, you've got me wrong
'Cause you are not that strong
Shut up and read my lips
'Cause boy, you make me sick
And I know what you do
I've had enough
You can keep her, just keep her, yeah
'Cause I don't want you

Boy, you've got me wrong
'Cause you are not that strong
Shut up and read my lips
'Cause boy, you make me sick
And I know what you do
I've had enough
You can keep her, just keep her, yeah
'Cause I don't want you
