I've been thinking of us, I've been thinking too much
And I haven't been sleeping, 'cause the nights have been rough
I've been telling myself that it's only love
Will I start to believe it if I say it enough?

I've been talking a lot, 'cause I think you should know
I want it out in the open, let the insides show
I've been thinking of us, I've been thinking too much
And I don't understand it, but it's only love

I got nothing to lose
I got nothing to lose

It's only love
It's only love, only love
It's only love
It's only love, only love
It's only right
That we find a way to keep it all simplified
'Cause it's only love, only love

We'll it's hard to admit that I long for your touch
Is the honesty okay? Or is it too much
Am I out of line? I don't wanna hurt this time
But it's better to say it, then let it live in my mind

'Cause everybody needs somebody to hold on to
I'm starting to believe, I could hold on to you
I'm gonna learn how to trust and let go of it all
Enjoy the feeling that I can't control the way I fall

I got nothing to lose
I got nothing to lose

It's only love
It's only love, only love
It's only love
It's only love, only love
It's only right
That we find a way to keep it all simplified
'Cause it's only love, only love

It's only love
Only love, only love
It's only love
Only love, only love
It's only right
That we find a way to keep it all simplified
'Cause it's only love, only love
