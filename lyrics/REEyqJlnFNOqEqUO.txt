All you, get back!
Comin' to the stage is a girl who's new in town
She goes by the name, 'Where-your-stacks-at?)
This pretty little thing, I swear, won't let you down
Watch it drop it like,
Hey!
Hey!

Oh it's not complicated,
So this won't take a while
You see,
Music make her dance and
Money, money, money make her smile
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got) Yeah!
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got) Yeah!

She's a super freak!
You wouldn't know it, if you saw her outside these velvet walls
No, she don't go where preachers preach
She only go to the church where dollars fall
Watch it drop it like,
Hey!
Hey!

Oh it's not complicated,
So this won't take a while
You see,
Music make her dance and
Money, money, money make her smile
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got) Yeah!
