I see it everywhere
In every face
In every place
That I go

I see in the eyes
Of all the strangers
And the people I know

Even in the buildings
And the statues
On the streets that I walk

Even in the voices
Even though they
Never sang when they talk

You're a love light
You're a love light
It is the greatest thing I've ever seen
It is the truth and the light

I watch you in the morning
As the sunlight rose up
With the new dawn
I saw in the evening
Smiling like it was the
Day you were born

And even after all
You hold your head up
Lift your voice and we sing
Acknowledge all the wonder
And the magic
That the journey might bring

You're a love light
You're a love light
It is the greatest thing I've ever seen
It is the truth and the light

You're a love light
You're a love light
It is the greatest thing I've ever seen
It is the truth and the light

Sail away with me...
