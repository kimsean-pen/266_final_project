If you want to ride with us tonight...
If you want to ride with us tonight...
If you want to ride with us tonight...

We will be the hands that lift you up and
we will be the hands that hold you high...
We will make you say our name forever,
we will make you want another try...

If you wanna ride...
Skulls!

If you wanna ride with us tonight...
If you wanna ride with us tonight...

We will be the love you've always wanted,
we will be the fire in your blood...
We will be the vice of your desire,
we will be salvation in the flood...

We will be the arms that lift you up and
we will be the hand that strike you down...
We will make you scream our name forever,
we will make you go another round...

If you wanna ride...
