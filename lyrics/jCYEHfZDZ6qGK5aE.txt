I dug a single seed into the ground
I hope it grows, grows
In a year or two if you're around you'll see a rose, rose
Pack me up and keep me hidden somewhere that you can find me
On this train to Paris going nowhere
Draw the bridge behind me

Don't be gone too long (too long)
Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone
Don't be gone too long (too long)
Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone
(Ooh, yeeah, ooh)
When you're, when you're gone
(Ooh, yeeah, ooh)
When you're gone

Golden leaves are dancing on the ground
It's getting cold, cold
Safe from time, we'll be forever young
Never old, old
See a ball of fire out in space
Zooming up behind me
All the wonder written on your face
Was there inside me

Don't be gone too long (too long)
Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone
Don't be gone too long (too long)
Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone
(Ohh)
When you're, when you're gone
(Ohhh)
When you're gone

Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
Is it really over?
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
Is it over?
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me (yeah)
Is it really over?
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
(Hooo)

Don't be gone too long (is it really over)
Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone
Don't be gone too long (is it really over/ don't be gone)
Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone

Don't be gone too long (don't be gone too long)
Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone (when it's over)
Don't be gone too long (when you're gone/ Is it really over)
Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone
