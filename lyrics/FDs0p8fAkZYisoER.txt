You've seen the world
And all the glory
Is what you want
The what you need
And when you go
Uh, you're gonna find out
All that you were
Was left to me

Wander yeah
Wanderluster
Wander yeah

What you forget
I still remember
But far away
The under .
When you return uhh
I will be waiting
In spite of all
That's gone before
