i'm sick of coloured hair
don't care about what you wear
i hate the things i see
don't care about anarchy
i'm sick of boring bands
rock stars and all their fans
the new wave overtones
and all the leather jacket clones

i'm so bored of you (and you)

i'm sick of pins and chains
hard drugs and dizzy brains
i'm sick of cheap romance
people who never dance
i'm sick of all the drunks
the poseurs and the punks
the stupid things they've done
i'm getting sick of everyone

i'm so bored of you

i'm sick of coloured hair
don't care about what you wear
i hate the things i see
don't care about anarchy
i'm sick of boring bands
rock stars and all their fans
the new wave overtones
and all the leather jacket clones

i'm so bored of you
