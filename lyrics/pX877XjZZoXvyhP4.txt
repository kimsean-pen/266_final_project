With pictures and words
Is this communicating?
The sounds that I've heard
The growling voice then fading
And yes, my heart was beating
Or was it just repeating?

With nickels and dimes
You soon will have a dollar
Am I in your time?
I see no need to swallow
Or catch a plane to travel
My mind's not made of gravel

Can you find your way?
Or do you want my vision?
It's dark there, they say
But that's just superstition
And in my last inspection
Is this the right direction?

I once had a girl
She told me I was funny
She said in your world
You needed lots of money
And things to kill your brother
But death just starts another
