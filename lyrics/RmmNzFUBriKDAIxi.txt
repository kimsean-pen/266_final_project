Salted
Heaving
Winter's breathing
We're eager
And anxious
To break the silence

We're running away
From the darkest moon
We're praying our lungs
Will find us soon

Listen to the heartbeat
Rushing when you hold me
Whispering that this was once our home
Our home
Just listen to the heartbeat

Secrets
Hidden
Inside our
Old friends
We're rueful
And righteous
And quick to undress

We're running away
From the darkest moon
We're praying our lungs
Will find us soon

Listen to the heartbeat
Rushing when you hold me
Whispering that this was once our home
Our home
Just listen to the heartbeat
Rushing when you hold me
Whispering that this was once our home
Our home

Broken glass but you can't see the signs
Still take my breath, when you don't realize

I try to take you back
To the fires that we once set
That burned up all the hills
And everything that we were
We left

We're running away
From the darkest moon
We're praying our lungs
Will find us soon

Just listen to the heartbeat (heartbeat)
Rushing when you hold me (hold me)
Whispering that this was once our home
Our home
Just listen to the heartbeat (heartbeat)
Rushing when you hold me (hold me)
Whispering that this was once our home
Our home
Our home
