It's time to regulate, I want this all to myself
You look me in the face, I ain't like nobody else
It's time to regulate, I've had enough of myself
You look me in the face, I'm just like everyone else

You got it comin' on the left
You feel it comin' on the right
All this pressure and problems
How we all gonna survive?

And you can look into the bright side
And you can step on all the fine lines
And you can let go of the disguise
You decide to run

And you might always feel like
You could be doin' better
'Cause you just never feel right
I'll make you feel better (ohoo)

It's time to regulate, I want this all to myself
You look me in the face, I ain't like nobody else
It's time to regulate, I've had enough of myself
You look me in the face, I'm just like everyone else

And you don't need to find love
I could have this all my way
And you don't need to fall in love
I could have this all my way

And you might always feel like
You could be doin' better
'Cause you just never feel right
I'll make you feel better

It's time to regulate, I want this all to myself
You look me in the face, I ain't like nobody else
It's time to regulate, I've had enough of myself
You look me in the face, I'm just like everyone else

We're just like everyone else
And we're like nobody else
We're just like everyone else
And we're like nobody else
We're just like everyone else
And we're like nobody else
Nobody else, nobody e-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

Ooh, you got me feelin' alright
Ooh, you got me feelin' alright
You got me feelin' alright
Ooh, you got me feelin' alright

It's time to regulate, I want this all to myself
You look me in the face, I ain't like nobody else
It's time to regulate, I've had enough of myself
You look me in the face, I'm just like everyone else
