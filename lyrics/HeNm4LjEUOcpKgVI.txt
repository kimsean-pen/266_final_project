I can hear you darling
Hidden in undergrounds
You are already here
Reveal to me
You are not in a place
That seems very safe
Someday I had a hard time
Even smiling
And lately I couldn't lift myself up
I couldn't pull myself to stand
I say heart keep on stop (repeats)
I say love keep on trying (repeats)
. love you same gal
You love the same man
Your heart just keeps on pumping
Our heart must keep on popping
I say heart keep on stop (repeats)
I say love keep on trying (repeats)
