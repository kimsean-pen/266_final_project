You awoke in a burning paper house
From the infinite fields of dreamless sleep
You return to Tiannammen
An eyewitness in a shroud
To see them fall, feel them yield
Reliving the terror of the crowd

Hold the whirlwind, don't let it blow
Just for a moment I seemed to know
Hold the whirlwind, don't let it blow
I seemed to know the ghost in you

The whisper of your scream
Sighed through the air
And faith the flag is torn and frayed
Infernal heat, glory in flame
Love was beaten and betrayed

In every step I hear your sobbing
Dare I break the shade with one caress
Dare I trespass to lift the veil
To touch the lips so soft and frail

Hold the whirlwind, don't let it blow
I seemed to know the ghost in you

Your captive heart's
The belief you share
With a kiss eternal
Spirits of the square

Hold the whirlwind, don't let it blow
Hope remains with the ghost in you
Hold the whirlwind, don't let it blow
I seemed to know the ghost in you

Don't let it blow
The ghost in you
The ghost in you
