I think I have the flu
And it's not because of you
Maybe I should call a GP
Maybe you could be my GP

Your injection does the trick
Sucking on your sticky (beep) stick

Let's call him a doctor
Not 'cause he's medically trained
Let's call him a doctor
'Cause he's fucked out of his brains
Let's call him a (beep)
Not 'cause he's dressed in white
Let's call him a doctor
'Cause I want to fuck him again

And when I leave your practice
You know I just came for the Lolli-(beep)
You always make me better
But I wish this illness never stopped

Your injection does the trick
(beep) on your sticky doctor's stick

Let's call him a doctor
Not 'cause he's medically trained
Let's call him a doctor
'Cause he's (beep) out of his brains
Let's call him a doctor
Not 'cause he's dressed in white
Let's call him a doctor
'Cause I want to (beep) him again

I'm a doctor
Did you call a doctor?
It's Dr. Doctor here
Don't you fear cause
I'm a doctor
A PhD doctor
The doctor of the hour
The doctor wow
Can I fix you?
Yes I can!

Let's call him a doctor
You know I want ya
Not 'cause he's medically trained
I wanna fuck his brains

Let's call him a doctor
