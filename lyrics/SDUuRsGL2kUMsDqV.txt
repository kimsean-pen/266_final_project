I couldn't fall asleep late last night
Thinkin' what we had just might be all over baby
And I don't know if you meant what you said
When you told me you was sick of tryin'
You was sick of fightin', cryin', lyin', didn't wanna do this again
We really said some things, we really did some things
We should've never did
And we both know it takes more just to apologize, boy
But from what I'm feelin' inside
Boy I'm yours and boy you're mine

And even if I said I was leavin' babe
I couldn't picture no more you and me
See I ain't perfect babe and you ain't perfect baby
So listen to the realest thing I could say

Sometimes it's a struggle babe
And it only hurts 'cause I love you baby
And for what it's worth I will struggle babe
'Cause I wanna be in your life
So I'ma keep tryin'
Over and over and over and over again
(Til we get it right baby)
Over and over and over and over again

See we done been together for a few years now
Ain't no way we just gon' sit right here and throw it out
See even if it's my mistake or if it's your mistake
And then we scream and shout
You gotta know I love you babe
And I'ma show you babe that we could work this out

So many nights we would tear rooms up in this house
We both know, we both know what is this about
When I look into your eyes
I'm in your heart and you are in mine

And even if I said I was leavin' babe
I couldn't picture no more you and me
See I ain't perfect babe and you ain't perfect baby
So listen to the realest thing I could say

Sometimes it's a struggle babe
And it only hurts 'cause I love you baby
And for what it's worth I will struggle babe
'Cause I wanna be in your life
So I'ma keep tryin'
Over and over and over and over again
(Til we get it right baby)
Over and over and over and over again

Said I don't wanna be alone baby
'Cause you are everything I know baby
See you're everything I need
And you're everything I see
And you're everything I feel
And you're everything in me
Said I don't wanna be alone baby
'Cause you are everything I know baby
See you're everything I need
And you're everything I see
And you're everything I feel
And you're everything in me

Sometimes it's a struggle babe
And it only hurts 'cause I love you baby
And for what it's worth I will struggle babe
'Cause I wanna be in your life
So I'ma keep tryin'
Over and over and over and over again
Over and over and over and over again

Over and over and over and over
And over and over, over agai.yeayeay... yea
Said, I don't wanna be without you bae, 'cause I love you babe
Said, I wanna be in your life, so I'mma keep tryin'
Over and over, and over and over and over and over, over again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, said I love you babe. I don't wanna see you leave me baby
Hold on... baby, just hold on
Mmmhmmm, 'cause all I need is you...
