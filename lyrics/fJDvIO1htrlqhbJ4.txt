A dancing puppet doll made of wood
I bet he'd run away one day if he could choose to leave or stay
He's got a string attached to every bone
She's got him round her little finger so she'll never feel alone

Oh sometimes I wonder, did it go
When lots of men had caused his soul
Dreaming of a wonderland
Wakes up and he's a man

Sometimes I wonder, did it go
When lots of men had caused his soul
Dreaming of a wonderland
Wakes up and he's a man

Oh, taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over another man's mind
Oh, taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over his mind

The day of leaving her, has struck his mind
When he sees her smile, he's hypnotized and he can't leave her behind
Looking to his left, there's the door
No need to try, tried it once before
And the bounds tied him beneath the floor

Sometimes I wonder, did it go
When lots of men had caused his soul
Dreaming of a wonderland
Wakes up and he's a man

Sometimes I wonder, did it go
When lots of men had caused his soul
Dreaming of a wonderland
Wakes up and he's a man

Oh, she's taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over another man's mind
Oh, taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over his mind

When they were out to buy her wedding-gown
She wanted nothing but the dress over a hundred thousand pound
But what she wants, she gets, or she will cry
Hits the man with her umbrella
She'll continue till' he dies

Sometimes I wonder, did it go
When lots of men had caused his soul
Dreaming of a wonderland
Wakes up and he's a man

Oh, taking control over another man's mind
Taking control of his mind

Oh, she's taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over another man's mind
Oh, taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over his mind

Oh, she's taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over another man's mind
Oh, taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over his mind
