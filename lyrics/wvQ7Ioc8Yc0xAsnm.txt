You are here as we lift You up
You are riding on our praise
Be enthroned over everything
You are seated in our praise

This is prophetic I can feel it in the air
We lift our praise and You change the atmosphere
With hearts open now everybody singing out
Oh-oh-oh

Turn it up this sound of praise
Make it louder than any other
Lift Him up and shout His name
Over all

As we praise, I can feel the change
As Your presence now invades
Hear the sound of the broken chains
Prison doors are giving way

This is prophetic I can feel it in the air
We lift our praise and You change the atmosphere
With hearts open now everybody singing out
I am free

Turn it up this sound of praise
Make it louder than any other
Lift Him up and shout His name
Over all

Turn it up this sound of praise
Make it louder than any other
Lift Him up and shout His name
Over all

Our praise goes up
Your rain comes down
Our praise goes up
Your rain comes down
Our praise goes up
Your rain comes down
Our praise goes up
Your rain comes down

With shouts of praise
We celebrate
King of glory enter in
You are riding on our praise
Oh Lord

Turn it up this sound of praise
Make it louder than any other
Lift Him up and shout His name
Over all

Turn it up this sound of praise
Make it louder than any other
Lift Him up and shout His name
Over all
