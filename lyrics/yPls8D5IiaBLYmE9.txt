Lisa's kissing men like a long walk home
When the music stops
Take a tip from me, don't go through the park
When you're on your own it's a long walk home

Well if they follow you
Don't look back
Like Dylan in the movies
On your own
If they follow you
It's not your money that they're after boy, it's you

Pure easy listening, settle down
On the pillow soft when they're all gone
You can concentrate on the one you love
You can concentrate, hey now they're gone

But if they follow you
Don't look back
Like Dylan in the movies
On your own
If they follow you
It's not your money that they're after boy, its you

Yeah you worth the trouble and you worth the pain
You're worth the worry, I would do the same
If we all went back to another time
I would love you over
I would love you over
I would love you...

If they follow you
Don't look back
Like Dylan in the movies
On your own
If they follow you
Tenderly you turn the lights off in your room

If they follow you
Don't look back
Like Dylan in the movies
On your own
If they follow you
