Gotta write a classic
Gotta write it in an attic
Baby, i'm an addict now
An addict for your love
I was a street boy
And you were my best toy
I found it easy to annoy you
But you were different from the rest
And i loved you all the wrong ways
Now listen to my say
If it changed to another way
Would the difference make it?
Would it be a classic?
I gotta send it right away

Gotta write a classic
Gotta write it in an attic
Baby, i'm an addict now
An addict for your love
Back Vocals
(I'm so down)
(And out of control)
(Without your love)
(I'm in love}
(Came for love)
(There's no living without you)

(Deep down i know ...)
(You're not hearing)
(The words i say)
(Gotta write it down)
(And send it right away)
Now i'm living my life
One day at a time since losing your love
I've been losing my mind
What more can i see

The future is so clear
And it's not what i mean
I mean it's not what it seems
I just keep living for the dreams
And it's not what i mean
I mean it's not what it seems
I just keep living for the dreams
Gotta write a classic ...
Gotta write it in an attic
Baby, i'm an addict now ...
An addict for your love
Gotta write it down

And send it right away
