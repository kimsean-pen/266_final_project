I looked at you, you stole my heart
You are all that I anticipated
I wanted you, every part
But I knew that love would be complicated

I began to touch but you wouldn't let it
It never seemed to be the right time
I started to give up, down to the limit
And then you changed your mind, oh

And we begin to rock steady
Steady rockin' all night long
And we begin to rock steady
Rockin' till the break of dawn

Rock steady
Steady rockin' all night long
Rock steady
Rockin' till the break of dawn

You looked at me, to my surprise
You were too anticipating
I should have known, it was in your eyes
That you were gettin' tired of waiting

You wanted me so much but I didn't get it
How could a fellow be so blind?
I started to give up but love wouldn't let it
Then you walked into my life

And we begin to rock steady
Steady rockin' all night long
And we begin to rock steady
Rockin' till the break of dawn

Rock steady
Steady rockin' all night long
Rock steady
Rockin' till the break of dawn

Rock, rock rock
Rock, rock rock

You wanted me so much but I didn't get it
How could a fellow be so blind?
Started to give up but love wouldn't let it
And you walked into my life

And we begin to rock steady
Steady rockin' all night long
And we begin to rock steady
Rockin' till the break of dawn

Rock steady
Steady rockin' all night long
Rock steady
Rockin' till the break of dawn

Rock steady
Steady rockin' all night long
Rock steady
Rockin' till the break of dawn
