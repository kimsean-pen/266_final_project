Come on lads, walk beside me
One more time into the darkness
Further than we've ever been
Further than we've ever been before

Come on lads, walk in line
We work the coalface, work the longwall

Following on from our fathers and brothers
Into the depths of the lower measures
Light from a distant sun plays across the shore
Oceans rise and fall

Wild untamed and unknown places
Were nothing to us, fell before us
We shaped the land, we changed the skyline
We had our day, our day is over

Following on from our fathers and brothers
Out of the depths of the lower measures
Light from a distant sun plays across the shore
Oceans rise and fall

We're working men, we follow the seam
Under the hills to the end of the lode
We're working men, we follow the seam
Under the fields to the end of the lode
We're working men, we follow the seam
Under the fields to the end of the lode
It's the end of the road

So come on lads, walk beside me
One last time (into the darkness) Oh
Across the open skyline
Shafts are capped and wheels stop turning

Following on from our fathers and brothers
Out of the depths of the lower measures
Light from a distant sun plays across the shore
Oceans rise and fall

We're working men, we follow the seam
Oh, under the hills to the end of the lode
We're working men, we follow the seam
Under the fields to the end of the lode

We're working men, we follow the seam
Under the hills to the end of the lode
We're working men, we follow the seam
Under the fields to the end of the lode

We're working men, we follow the seam
Follow the seam (Under the hills to the end of the lode)
Follow the seam
We're working men, we follow the seam
So come on lads, and walk beside me
