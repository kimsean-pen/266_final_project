We fall apart just let me start to say goodbye
But there was nobody watching (nobody watching)
You've lost your grip you start to slip but don't know why
And this is just like beginning (like beginning)
You have the hopes to make it last it's moving fast
And now you're realizing (realizing)
But in the past the dreams you had made people feel
Like you were just reciting (just reciting)

Fading in the afterglow
The chance at luck and pride
Where we end up we could never know
And all I know is we seem to be

Changing, Better to turn and walk away
Fading, All these lights just turn to Grey
Changing, Better to turn and walk away
But the strange thing, Is that I don't feel you fade

This is an act Stop holding back the things you lost
Cannot replace what's missing (what's missing)
And from the start you played the part and now your arts
Become a great deception

Fading in the afterglow
The chance at luck and pride
Where we end up we could never know
And all I know is we seem to be

Changing, Better to turn and walk away
Fading, All these lights just turn to grey
Changing, Better to turn and walk away
But the strange thing, Is that I dont feel you fade

One last breath to say goodbye
I tell myself another lie
Stripped of all I hold so dear
The moments lost and I am sinking down lower
I drown myself in the water
And i am watching my life pass before my eyes
It comes as no surprise

You fall apart and then you stop
You fall apart and then you stop
You fall apart and then you... Stop

Changing, Better to turn and walk away
Fading, All these lights just turn to grey
Changing, Better to turn and walk away
But the strange thing is that I dont feel you fade

You fall apart and then you stop
You fall apart and then you stop
You fall apart and then you... Stop
