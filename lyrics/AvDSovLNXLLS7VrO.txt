I am so unlike you in so many ways
I know I'm just a copy that carries on the stain
(But) We make the same mistake
(Cuz) We are one and the same
(But) We leave behind the stain
That cannot separate

All that lies in me
All that dies in me
How can I live without you?
All that lies in me
All that dies in me
How can I live without you?

I am your mirror image, I'm all you left behind
You made me what I am and who the hell am I?
(But) We make the same mistake
(Cuz) We are one and the same
(But) We leave behind the stain
That cannot separate

All that lies in me
All that dies in me
How can I live without you?
All that lies in me
All that dies in me
How can I live without you?

Why, yo no entiendo porque
I know that our lives are the same
Y mi vida is just a guessing game, a dirty stain that I cannot play
But I follow your steps
In the same way that you just walked away
And pushed away the fact that I will not live

Do you think of me?
Do you dream of me?
I always dream about you
Do you think of me?
Do you dream of me?
I always dream about you

All that lies in me
All that dies in me
How can I live without you?
All that lies in me
All that dies in me
How can I live without you?
