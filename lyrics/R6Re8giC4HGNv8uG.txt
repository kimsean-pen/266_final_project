I don't want to be in Monday morning, heading back to work,
Stuck in traffic, going slow, nothing on the radio,
I don't wanna be another chore to check off on your list,
Of things you gotta do, and places that you gotta go.
Oh no...

I wanna be your Friday night speed ride,
Summertime, sunshine, barefoot in the moonlight,
I wanna be your jackpot, hot spot, wide open road in a candy apple rag top,
I wanna set you free, I wanna take you high,
I wanna be, wanna be your Friday night.

We can rock together, let the good times roll forever,
Fill up our cup, make a memory, drink it up,
I don't wanna miss another minute, wanna live it with you,
'Neath the blue sky, falling in love.

I wanna be your Friday night speed ride,
Summertime, sunshine, barefoot in the moonlight,
I wanna be your jackpot, hot spot, wide open road in a candy apple rag top,
I wanna set you free, I wanna take you high,
I wanna be, wanna be your Friday night.

I wanna be your lemonade in the shade,
Money in your pocket 'cos you just got paid babe.

I wanna be your Friday night speed ride,
Summertime, sunshine, barefoot in the moonlight,
I wanna be your jackpot, hot spot, wide open road in a candy apple rag top,
I wanna set you free, I wanna take you high,
I wanna be, wanna be your Friday night.

Oh yeah...
Wanna be your Friday night,
F-F-F-Friday night.
