Golden light, turn away
If I run to you, would you stay?
I might be a prototype, but we're both real inside
Would you take me up this time?
Come take me up this time
Cause I'm gonna find that place the way that I want

I will find my beta love
When I find my beta love
You will be my beta love
My beta love
Now we're getting closer

In this hole, I believe
You can't tell me no, it's no dream
In this city of robot hunts, as we're made to be
You take me up this time
You take me uá¹— this time
I was made in that place, no way to deny

I will find my beta love
When I find my beta love
You will be my beta love
My beta love
Now we're getting closer

Oh, aye, oh, aye, oh
My beta love
When I find my beta love
You will be my beta move
My beta love
Now we're getting closer
My beta love
When I find my beta love
You will be my beta move
My beta love
Now we're getting closer
Close to you
