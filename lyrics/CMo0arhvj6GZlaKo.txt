Hold on tight
Wrap your arms around me 'til your knuckles are burning white
All your tears (all you your tears)
They couldn't match the bitter taste of all these wasted years

And all you take, take
Everything that wasn't even yours
Wait, wait
You don't got a hold of me anymore

In a clear view, there's a silhouette
And I watch you and I can't forget (knew we were done when you locked that door)
Yeah, I figured it out now
Breakin's what the heart is for

When I see you in a silhouette
And you hold close
Do you feel regret? (keeping me down when I hit that floor)
And I figured it out, girl
Breakin's what your heart is

For so long
I've had to bite my tongue
But what's the point if the feelings gone?
I turn my head (turn my head)
Learned I only see some memory but all I see is red (all I see is red)

Don't, don't
Say it didn't happen that way
I won't, won't
Believe another word that you say

In a clear view there's a silhouette
And I watch you and I can't forget (knew we were done when you locked that door)
Yeah, I figured it out now
Breakin's what the heart is for

When I see you in a silhouette
And you hold close
Do you feel regret? (keeping me down when I hit that floor)
Yeah, I figured it out, girl
Breakin's what your heart is for

(Break-break-break-break, break-break-break-break)
Yeah, breaking's what your heart is for
(Break-break-break-break, break-break-break-break)
Yeah, breaking's what your heart is for

And not a soul sleeps
Another heart skips a beat
It's every note that you wrote
And I hope that you choke on the lines
You're wasting my time, another heart beats tonight

In a clear view there's a silhouette
And I watch you, no I'll never forget (knew we were done when you locked that door)
Yeah, I figured it out now
Breakin's what the heart is for

When I see you in a silhouette
And you hold close
Do you feel regret? (keeping me down when I hit that floor)
And I figured it out, girl
Breakin's what your heart is for

(Break-break-break-break, break-break-break-break)
Yeah, breaking's what your heart is for
(Break-break-break-break, break-break-break-break)
Yeah, breaking's what your heart is for
(Break-break-break-break, break-break-break-break)
Yeah, breaking's what your heart is for
(Break-break-break-break, break-break-break-break)
Yeah, breaking's what your heart
