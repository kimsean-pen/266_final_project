It's beem hard days
To mama
And hard days for me too
Keep fighting my love

From day one, mom
And no cries
Cause I knew she do

It shouldn't be that hard
No mama
But accept each other
Then make it easy

Love is no problem
No mama
We love each other
Then make it easy

Cause it's alright
Yeah it's ok
It's also fine
Then make it easy

Cause it's alright
Mama it's ok
That's my life
Let's make it easy
Let's make it easy.

Hm, hmm ...

Make it easy
Then make it easy
Make it easy mama
