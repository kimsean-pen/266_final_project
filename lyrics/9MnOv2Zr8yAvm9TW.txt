I'm asking myself if living without a feeling is really living
Is heaven everything any good?
If everything's all you have
I love myself away
I became untouchable
Got cold up by the day
Dreaming of blue skies
Nothing on my way
Just the person in the mirror
Take me to the flame
It's now or never
It's about time that start loving again
It's about time the sun shine touches my skin
I'll hold your feelings till my heart beats again
Will somebody show me what I've been missing
Yeah, it's about time that start loving again
For all the time I was so scared of flying
So I stuck to the running
But I'm not running anymore
I'm dancing my nights away
No I'm wide awake
I got my eye on the horizon
Watch me fly away
Into the blue sky
Nothing in my way
Just the person in the mirror
Take me to the flame
It's now or never
It's about time that start loving again
It's about time the sun shine touches my skin
I'll hold your feelings till my heart beats again
Will somebody show me what I've been missing
Yeah, it's about time that start loving again
Each bottle of emotion
Each tear I never cried
I need a big explosion
It's time for me to fly
Each bottle of emotion
Each tear I never cried
I need a big explosion
It's time for me to fly
Each bottle of emotion
Each tear I never cried
I need a big explosion
It's time for me to fly
Each bottle of emotion
Each tear I never cried
I need a big explosion
It's time for me to fly
It's about time that start loving again
It's about time the sun shine touches my skin
I'll hold your feelings till my heart beats again
Will somebody show me what I've been missing
Yeah, it's about time that start loving again
Each bottle of emotion
Each tear I never cried
I need a big explosion
It's time for me to fly
Each bottle of emotion
Each tear I never cried
I need a big explosion
It's time for me to fly
