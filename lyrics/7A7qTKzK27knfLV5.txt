Some people are made of plastic
And you know some people are made of wood
Some people have hearts of stone
Some people are up to no good
But baby, I'm for real
I'm as real as real can get
Said if what you're looking for is real loving
Then what you see is what you get

What you see, what you see
Is what you get, is what you get
What you see, what you see

Is what you get, is what you get
I said what you see is what you get, now baby
And the real thing is the best thing yet, come on
You know some people
Are made of lies to bring you down
Just to shame your name
And baby, I have good intentions
'Cause breaking hearts, they just ain't my game
All I want to do is love you
And sugar, I won't fill you with regret
Yeah, what you're looking for is real good loving, baby
Then what you see is what you gonna get
What you see is what you get
What you see is what you get
