You hear my cry, lover of mine
No tear in the eye or fear in my mind
The forest is thick and we don't recognize
We parted our lips, and we reached from inside

Wide-open field
We know we can feel
Awake and unreal, oh
Off to nowhere
Off to nowhere

Off to nowhere

Need more people to be satisfied
No fear of a god and a prayer for the night
Come into our minds and you rush through our lives
We parted our lips, and we reached from inside

The wide-open field
We know we can feel
Awake and unreal, oh
Off to nowhere, hey

Off to nowhere

The only thing you've got (Off to nowhere)
You know you're better off without it
The only thing you've got (Off to nowhere)
You know you're better off without it
The only thing you've got (Off to nowhere)
You know you're better off without it
The only thing you've got (Off to nowhere)
You know you're better off without it

Youngest fire
You decide
You decide
What is right
Youngest fire
Who decides?
We decide
What is right
Near yet so far
Isn't it?
Near yet so far (The only thing you've got)
Isn't it? (You know you're better off without it)
Near yet so far (The only thing you've got)
Isn't it? (You know you're better off without it)
Near yet so far (The only thing you've got)
Isn't it? (You know you're better off without it)
Near yet so far (The only thing you've got)
Isn't it? (You know you're better off without it)
