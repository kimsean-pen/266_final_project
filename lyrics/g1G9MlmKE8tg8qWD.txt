Rocking around the Christmas Tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Let the Christmas Spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly"
"Deck the halls with boughs of holly"

Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old-fashioned way
Come on

You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly"
"Deck the halls with boughs of holly"

Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old-fashioned way
In the new old-fashioned way
