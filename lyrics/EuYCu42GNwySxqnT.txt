You make things so hard
always try to be away from those
why you shun me away
don't you wanna care about minds of mine

I will get down on my knees so
If you get back to me then oh

It's like roller-coaster ride
you make me high
It's like roller-coaster ride
you make me high

please stop swept away
theres no new news in here. It's done
let my way you say
or neither of us remain inside

I will get down to my knees yet
but if you get back to me then oh

It's like roller-coaster ride
you make me high
It's like roller-coaster ride
you make me high
