Broken by the back of it
It was hard enough without the loss
Hanging on a thread of it
It was hard enough without the cost

Dancing to your lover's beat
Beating on heavy feet
Working on a dream you made
Well, you made enough to ride the wave

Elijah, you're too young to be lost
Elijah, don't fade out on the cross
Elijah, I don't know
What it is you need to do

Wish you could have talked to me
Found another way to be
Living hard don't sound so good
It's hard to get out of the woods

Elijah, you're too young to be lost
Elijah, don't fade out on the cross
Elijah, I don't know
What it is you need to do

The radio was playing all day
When I heard you singing
Fingers strom the sound through delay
It echoes to me
Wishbones' hidden in the residue
Someday they'll find you
Just a little piece of good for two
It won't forget you

Elijah, you're too young to be lost
Elijah, don't fade out on the cross
Elijah, I don't know
What it is you need to do.
