All this you give
It's why you suppose to live first
Stuck in a phase
Is guided by mistakes
You're addictive poison is dragging me down
Trying to swim out I'm stuck here watching me drown
Laying away the colors will fade from the tears of my face
I've let you slip away
I can kiss whoever I'm wearing the crown
Someday get out my love don't want you 'cause now

I'm high and lovesick
I laugh now
I'm fine to just let you go
I'm high and lovesick
I laugh now
I'm fine to just let you go

I'm fine to just let you go

I'm fine to just let you go
