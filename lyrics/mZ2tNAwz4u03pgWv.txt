Painstaking with misfortune
all i want is the world to give a fuck
bad luck is embedded in my skin
no one cares when you're six feet deep
in a life of loss with a heart of glass
i'm shattered and nothing can bring me back
my world is painted black
Painstaking with misfortune
all i want is the world to give a fuck
My life, isn't worth shit
so fuck you and fuck this world
Motherfucker
