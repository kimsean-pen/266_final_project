You only hate the ones you love
And I was always hating you
I was always chasing you
Even from the start when we were through

Thought that you loved me
You held me on the roof
Was it all worth it
Now you're pretending
That I'm someone you never knew

Ahhhhh
But you never knew
You never knew

Hold my breath I'm going under
Running till until I fall down
Feel you slipping through my fingers
You never knew you never
Knew all the times I needed you

You only hate the ones you love
Let me get a hold of you
You take a hold of me
Even in my dreams
Thought that you loved me
You held me on the roof
Was it all worth it
Now you're pretending
That I'm someone you never knew

Hold my breath I'm going under
Running till until I fall down
Feel you slipping through my fingers
You never knew you never
Knew all the times I needed you

Hold my breath I'm going under
Running till until I fall down
Feel you slipping through my fingers
You never knew you never
Knew all the times I needed you
