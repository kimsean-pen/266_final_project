Lie enough to try to convince me of your plans
All these people asking questions of why all the sudden distance
And I can't find enough words to spit into your face to suffice all my dues

Is it so hard to just take me as I am?
Why is it a contest of who shall take your hand?
I deserve to abandon this toxicness
But you still intoxicate me
Hastily trying to forget

I want to know what you think inside that head
Since the days you lost your relevance
And traded it instead
For new friends and trends that you wanted so bad
But you got what you were looking for
So now say that you're glad

Is it so hard to just take me as I am?
Why is it a contest of who shall take your hand?
I deserve to abandon this toxicness
But you still intoxicate me
Hastily trying to-

Forget all the times
Running to confide in him
It doesn't make a difference
Because I know what I did
Forget all the times
Running to confide in him
It never made a difference
Because I know what I did

Forget all the times
Running to confide in him
Forget all those times
It never made a difference

Is it so hard to just take me as I am?
Why is it a contest of who shall take your hand?
I deserve to abandon this toxicness
But you still intoxicate me
Hastily trying to forget

Is it so hard to just take me as I am?
Always a contest of who shall take your hand
I deserve to abandon this toxicness
But you're so intoxicating
Making this harder to forget.
