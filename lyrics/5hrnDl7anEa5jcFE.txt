Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I'm feelin' about you
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

I know I'd go back to you

We never got it right
Playin' and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it's not me
And what's the point in hidin'?
Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back, back, back
I know I'd...

I'll go back to you
I'll go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
(Go back to you, I'd go back to you)
I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
