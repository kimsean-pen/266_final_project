Now you get along with me
I'm gonna make you mine and make you free
In the new world

Breath goes in and breath goes out
And it makes me scream, it makes me shout
In the new world

Rev it up and make it start
Tear it up and take my heart
In the new world

I'm lost in you, I'm lost in crowds
I fight for you, and say out loud
It's a new world

This is my world (burning, burning)
This is my world (burning, burning)

Ripped off life and ripped off pain
I'll take my time and make you sane
In the new world

This is my world (burning, burning)
This is my world (burning, burning)

Our whole existence starts to change
We're born with love and born with rage
Our whole existence starts to change
We're born with love and born with rage

Now you get along with me
I'm gonna make you mine and make you free
In the new world

Now you get along with me
I'm gonna make you mine and make you free
In the new world

This is my world (burning, burning)
This is my world (burning, burning)

This (burning, burning)
Is (burning, burning)
My world (burning, burning).
