I've loved everything about you that hurts
So let me see your moves, let me see your moves
Lips pressed close to mine
True blue, but the prince of any failing empire knows that
Everybody wants, everybody wants
To drive on through the night if it's the drive back home

Things aren't the same anymore
Some nights it gets so bad that I almost pick up the phone
Trade Baby Blues, for Wide-Eyed Browns
I sleep with your old shirts
And walk through this house in your shoes
I know it's strange
It's a strange way of saying that I know I'm supposed to love you
I'm supposed to love you, oh, oh, oh

I've already given up on myself twice
Third time is the charm, third time is the charm
Threw caution to the wind but I've got a lousy arm
And I've traced your shadows on the wall
Now I kiss them whenever I'm down, whenever I'm down
Figured on, not figuring myself out

Things aren't the same anymore
Some nights it gets so bad that I almost pick up the phone
Trade Baby Blues, for Wide-Eyed Browns
I sleep with your old shirts
And walk through this house in your shoes
I know it's strange
It's a strange way of saying that I know I'm supposed to love you
I'm supposed to love you, ohh

I was born under a bad sign, but you saved my life
That night on the roof of your hotel
"Cross my heart and hope to die, splinter from the headboard in my eye"
Photo-proofed kisses I remember so well

Trade Baby Blues, for Wide-Eyed Browns
I sleep with your old shirts
And walk through this house in your shoes
I know it's strange
It's a strange way of saying that I know I'm supposed to love you
I'm supposed to love you, whoa, whoa-oh-oh
