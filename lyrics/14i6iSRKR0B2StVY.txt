Ai yai yai
Ai yai yai
Ai yai yai
Where's my samurai?

I'm searching for a man
All across Japan
Just to find, to find my samurai
Someone who is strong
But still a little shy
Yes, I need, I need my samurai
Ai yai yai, I'm your little butterfly
Green, black and blue make the colours in the sky

Ai yai yai, I'm your little butterfly
Green, black and blue make the colours in the sky
I'm searching in the woods
And high upon the hills
Just to find, to find my samurai
Someone who won't regret
To keep me in his net
Yes, I need, I need my samurai

Ai yai yai, I'm your little butterfly
Green, black and blue make the colours in the sky
Ai yai yai, I'm your little butterfly

Green, black and blue make the colours in the sky
Ai yai yai
Ai yai yai
Ai yai yai

Where's my samurai?
Ai yai yai
Ai yai yai
Ai yai yai
Where's my samurai?
Oh oh (Oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh (Oh oh oh oh)
Ai yai yai, I'm your little butterfly

Green, black and blue make the colours in the sky
Ai yai yai, I'm your little butterfly
Green, black and blue make the colours in the sky
Ai yai yai, I'm your little butterfly
Green, black and blue make the colours in the sky
Ai yai yai, I'm your little butterfly
Green, black and blue make the colours in the sky
Ai yai yai
Ai yai yai
Ai yai yai
Where's my samurai?
Ai yai yai
Ai yai yai
Ai yai yai
Where's my samurai?
Ai yai yai, I'm your little butterfly
Green, black and blue make the colours in the sky
