I just can't believe you're gone,
Still waiting for morning to come
When I see if the sun will rise
And the way that your by my side
When we had so much in store
Tell me what is it all reaching for

When we're through building memories
I'll hold yesterday in my heart, in my heart
They can take tomorrow and the plans we made,
They can take the music that we never play
All the broken dreams, take everything,
Just take it away
They can never have yesterday
They can take the future that we'll never know
They can take the places that we said we would go

All the broken dreams take everything

Just take it away
They can never have yesterday
You always choose to stay
I should be thankful for every day

Heaven knows what the future holds
Or at least how the story goes

I never believed until now
I know I'll see you again I'm sure
No it's not selfish to ask for more

One more night one more day
One more smile on your face
But they can't take yesterday

They can take tomorrow and the plans we made,
They can take the music that we'll never play
All the broken dreams, take everything,
Just take it away
They can never have yesterday
They can take the future that we'll never know
They can take the places that we said we would go
All the broken dreams take everything
Just take it away
They can never have yesterday
I thought our days would last for ever
But it wasn't our destiny
'Cause in my mind we had so much time
But I was so wrong
No I can believe that
I can still find the strength in the moments we made
I'm looking back on yesterday
They can take tomorrow and the plans we made,
They can take the music that we never play
All the broken dreams, take everything,
Just take it away
They can never have yesterday
They can take the future that we'll never know
They can take the places that we said we would go
All the broken dreams take everything
Just take it away
They can never have yesterday
