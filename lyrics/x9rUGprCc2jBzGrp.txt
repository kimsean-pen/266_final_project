Yes I've been flying
flying all over the world
from the horizon to the world
I've been flying in the sky
온 세상이 깜깜해진 새벽에
누구보다 밝아지는 내 꿈의 경계
baby come and i'll tell you secret
I've been hiding from the sky
외로운 섬에 갇혀버린 작은 새
don't know u don't know
이해까진 안 바래
다들 날 죽은 바다라고 불러
음 설명은 생략할게
but it ain't done
이해해 봤자 뭐해
내 입만 더 귀찮게
i'm too tired of it sick of this
now i can say to my world
다 괜찮아
i was in the darkness sea
i was on the highest hills
나도 내가 어려워 가끔은
감아 두 눈을
i was in the darkness sea
darkness sea
on the highest hills
U suck
Why are still doing this
Give up girl u already failed
Nobody waits for u
Fxxx that I never stop
From here to the horizon
That's gonna be ma world
