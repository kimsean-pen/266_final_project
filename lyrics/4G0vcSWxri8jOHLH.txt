How the Mighty trumpet
brings the freaks out to the floor!

We got the speakers pumpin' climie trumpet

Got that freak flow, freak show

Welcome to the service
Let the Leaders lead, Preachers preach.
Welcome to the service.

just to keep their fire burnin',
and we don't need to water let that
mother- mother- burn.
Timmy play your trumpet,
let the people go beserk.
