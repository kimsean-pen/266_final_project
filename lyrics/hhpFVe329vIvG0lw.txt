I'm gonna need you to dance if we're gonna pull off
This intimidation and be perfect for creation
Bottle our perspiration and sell it to the [?]
And collect lots of money and not know where it came from
Throw the bodies in the lake although
We're head of the investigation
Just be happy

And then when you give up protect your soul
And it never loathed someone else's hands
That would be a place you could go to enjoy the tension

These days black clouds are always hovering
