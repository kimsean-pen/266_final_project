Benny Goodman
You're gonna see me in the light of the morning
You're gonna feel me in a droplet of rain
You're gonna hear me in icicles forming
You're gonna miss me till your dying day

You take a breath and curse while you're breathing
You swear you tasted me in the salt of your skin
You peel your heart on the regular beatings
The thought you blocked out, came out back in

Woh! The one who laughs, last
Who waits until the joke is long dead
At the moment
You strike like Benny Goodman

(Benny Goodman)

You're gonna miss me till your dying day

Woh! The one who laughs, last
Who waits until the joke is long dead
At the moment
You strike like Benny Goodman

(You strike like Benny Goodman)
