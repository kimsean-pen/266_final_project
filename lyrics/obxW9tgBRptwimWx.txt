I was a fool to ever leave your side
Me minus you is such a lonely ride
The breakup we had has made me lonesome and sad
I realize I love you
'Cause I want you bad, hey, hey
I spent the evening with the radio
Regret the moment that I let you go
Our quarrel was such a way of learning so much
I know now that I love you
'Cause I need your touch, hey, hey
Reunited and it feels so good
Reunited 'cause we understood
There's one perfect fit
And, sugar, this one is it
We both are so excited
'Cause we're reunited, hey, hey
I sat here staring at the same old wall
Came back to life just when I got your call
I wished I could climb right through the telephone line
And give you what you want
So you will still be mine, hey, hey
I can't go cheating, honey, I can't play
I found it very hard to stay away
As we reminisce on precious moments like this
I'm glad we're back together
'Cause I missed your kiss, hey, hey
Reunited and it feels so good
Reunited 'cause we understood
There's one perfect fit
And, sugar, this one is it
We both are so excited
'Cause we're reunited, hey, hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ba-a-a-by

Oh, lover, lover
This is solid love
And you're exactly what I'm dreaming of

All through the day
And all through the night
I'll give you all the love I have
With all my might
Hey, hey

Reunited
And it feels so good
Reunited
Cause we understood

There's one perfect fit
And sugar, this one is it
We both are so excited
'Cause we're reunited, hey, hey

Whooaa. Listen baby
I won't ever make you cry
I won't let one day go by
Without holding you without
Without kissing you
Without loving yooou

Reunited
You're my everything
Only you know how to free
Of all the love that is in me
I want to let you know
I won't let you go
I want to let you know
I won't let you go

Reunited
Whooo. feel so good

Reunited
And it feels so good
Reunited
Cause we understood

There's one perfect fit
And sugar, this one is it
We both are so excited
'Cause we're reunited, hey, hey
