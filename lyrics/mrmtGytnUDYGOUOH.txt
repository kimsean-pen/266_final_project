With my winter time
My idols and stage fright
In another night
Where the lights are loud and bright

One dream from wakin' up saved
Too shy to hold in the rage

I know no luxury
Of knowing what your eyes read
I know one million ways
To always pick the wrong thing to say
Oh yes I do

A love that you never gave
Always one time zone away
Oh it's not out of spite
Oh I just know what's right
So that's why

Bad luck blue eyes goodbye
Bad luck blue eyes goodbye
Bad luck blue eyes goodbye
Bad luck blue eyes goodbye
Yes, yes, yes

Sometimes a memory
Only sees what it wants to believe
And what fills in between
Are days and nights that don't mean a thing
No they don't, no they don't, ooo

It's such a simple suicide
Where they can't bleed
A second chance never tried
Oh why don't you understand?
I need a helpin' hand
So that's why

Bad luck blue eyes goodbye
Bad luck blue eyes goodbye
Bad luck blue eyes goodbye
Bad luck blue eyes goodbye

So you think that you've seen it all
Is that a fact?
So out your mouth a dictionary
Spouts about this and that

You got your do's, your don'ts
Because and why
Well I don't trust no one who don't
Take their own advice

Bad luck blue eyes goodbye
Bad luck blue eyes goodbye
Bad luck blue eyes goodbye
