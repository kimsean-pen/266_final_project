Oh Lord above, if I just killed a man
Let somebody take the blame
Oh Lord above, if I'm knelling down
My prayer, take away this pain, oh, nothing helps

I'm praying, oh Lord, I'm praying to You
Take away this guilt all up in my head
I'm pleading, oh Lord, I'm pleading with You
We got some dealings to do before the day I'm dead

He came for me just like I knew he would
But this time I was ready, and I killed him good
But we weren't alone, there was one more left
He took my weapon from me, put it to the test

That's when this angel appeared out of the dark
With the devil in his eyes but God in his heart
He slayed him down, saved me from a sudden death
But I've still done wrong

So now I'm praying, oh Lord, I'm praying to You
Take away this guilt all up in my head
I'm pleading, oh Lord, I'm pleading with You
We got some dealings to do before the day I'm dead

So there we are, an angel and a man
Both just standing there, blood on our hands
"What we gon' do now?" Is what I thought
But before I could say it, the angel talked

He said, "I'm in here for life anyway
You're only in here for five, I'll take the blame
So go run now, don't feel ashamed"
But oh Lord, I do, that's why I'm pray

I'm praying, oh Lord, I'm praying to You
Atone me from these sins weighing down on my soul
I'm pleading, oh Lord, I'm pleading with You
Got some healing to do, inside I'm feeling low

I'm praying, oh Lord, I'm praying to You
Take away this guilt all up in my head
I'm pleading, oh Lord, I'm pleading with You
We got some dealings to do before the day I'm dead

I'm praying, oh Lord, I'm praying to You
Atone me from these sins weighing down on my soul
I'm pleading, oh Lord, I'm pleading with You
Got some healing to do, inside I'm feeling low
