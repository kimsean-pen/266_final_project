She's out of sight
He's out of mind
They've always lived in the castle

The frozen nights
And moving lights
They're inside out of the window

There's a fire in the city of pictures
Leaving nothing but ashes below
It's only forever for a day
Tomorrow is burning away
Burn away

She's out of touch
He's out of time
They'll always live in the castle

The fading flowers
The passing hours
They fall like sand through the fingers

There's a fire in the city of pictures
Leaving nothing but ashes below
It's only forever for a day
Tomorrow is burning away
Burn away

There's a fire in the city of pictures
Leaving nothing but ashes below
It's only forever for a day
Tomorrow is burning away
Burn away
