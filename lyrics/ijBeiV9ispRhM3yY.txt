I don't ever want to believe
I don't ever want to believe, yeah
That when we die
We all leave

Your innocence is not forgotten
I hope you know that where you are I wish you well
I hope you sleep in a perfect memory
You know it's hard I tried
I could never say goodbye

I don't ever wanna believe
No I don't ever wanna believe, yeah
That when we die
We all leave
I don't ever wanna let go
I hope that you see, yeah
That there's a part of you that's left inside of me

Yesterday just took me hostage
Yesterday locked me away from any truth
And now tomorrow's here without you
I know it's hard I've tried
I could never say goodbye

I don't ever wanna believe
I don't ever wanna believe, yeah
That when we die
We all leave
I don't ever wanna let go
I hope that you see, yeah
That there's a part of you that's left inside of me
That there's a part of you that left inside

I try to push you away
But you never push back ('cause I know)
You know I'll never forget you
I never thought I'd say that
You made a mess out of me (I know)

I don't ever wanna believe
I don't ever wanna believe, yeah
That when we die
That we all leave

I don't ever wanna believe
I don't ever wanna believe, yeah
That when we die
That we all leave

I don't ever wanna let go
I hope that you see, yeah
That there's a part of you that's left inside of me

That there's a part of you that's left inside of me
That there's a part of you that's left inside of me
That there's a part of you that's left inside of me
