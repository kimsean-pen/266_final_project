Take your time
So they say
and that's probably the best way to be
But what about those who are followers and what about hit artists
I will promise to do my very best
to do my duty for god and my country even though im just human, after all .
I will promise not to smoke to much and I will promise not to party
Too hard
Too hard
Too hard
Its too hard
Did you remember the cylophone that took you everywhere from home
Well I did
Well i've tried
Life is like a ball of beauty
That makes you want to just cry
Then you die
Yeah yeah yeah
I will promise to go out of my way, to do the right thing from now on, believe me baby
There comes a time in every mans life when hes got to take hold of the hands that aint his but it is
Take your time so they say,
And that's got to be the best way
but what about those who are fathers and what about the others
I know that you don't know a stranger
But i'm no stranger than the rest
And i'm no stranger to you
Yeah yeah yeah

Take your time they say
is all around and I think I've seen I 've noticed where i'm bound
There comes a time in every mans life where he got to hold tight to the heart of the matter of hands
So take your time baby girl
Because that's, that's the best of all
One day you'll believe me
I will promise to do my very best, to do my very best for you
And that wont be to hard
too hard
too hard
too hard
too hard
