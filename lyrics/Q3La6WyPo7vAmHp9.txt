the horizon, now as dark as the crimes that brought them here,
is filled with my impending dread
my foolish actions will cost so many good men
Achilles has come...

a thousand sails approaching
sent here in her name to reclaim the one I stole
and destroy the walls of Troy

desire leaves me numb to all the pain surrounding me
storms will arise to condemn me
I will not die before her eyes...
it ends tonight

desire leaves me numb to all the pain surrounding me
storms will arise to condemn me
I will not die before her eyes...
it ends tonight
tragically I now must accept the penance I have earned
she is cursed and tonight we die
in the dawn of this, my end, I hold my sword true
I must let her go...

a thousand sails approaching
sent here in her name to reclaim the one I stole
and destroy the walls of Troy

desire leaves me numb to all the pain surrounding me
storms will arise to condemn me
I will not die before her eyes...
it ends tonight

it ends tonight, I am alone
pain fills her eyes, I am alone

I must save my honor, I cannot let them win, the blood of many spills
sacred and profane is our love in death...
