bright eyes fading
young eyes beaten
to black and blue
sunrise has been sinking since i was two
one wounded and another dead
i've spent years
building these walls
when all of this time
my sky has been falling
burden to bare
this anger is
empty but heavy
my heart carries
the weight of your world
my wounds are open
i am out of blood
