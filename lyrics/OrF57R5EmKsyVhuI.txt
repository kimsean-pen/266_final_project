Tell me what you know
'Bout a motherfucker out the bottom
With a gold grill gleamin', makin all these hoes problems
Stalker, creepin', out the fuckin' dungeon
Switchblade on 'em hit the guts like a pumpkin, dumpin
30 rounds of the clip off rip
Too thick with the stick bet I won't miss
Lil' Slick real sick, don't talk shit
Whip, whip, like a brick scale on fish
$uicide, night time, no we don't fight crime, oh
It's the grey 5-9 with the real red eyes and we dying inside, oh
Bodies in fluoride let the rope untie just crucify me
Yung Christ wrists sliced couple hoes on ice singing R.I.P

Ruby was a motherfucking reject
Then I cut my wrists and now I motherfucking bleed checks
Still broke after all the motherfucking weed gets rolled
Hoes askin' if I see a ghost, tell 'em no
I just seep smoke when the weeds blown
She chokes from the deep-throat, 3 feet of rope, lethal
Slay the fuckin' sheep, so evil
I'mma hang myself and then I get to see home
Ruby a fucking demon
Ruby got a cult now, hoes tryna bolt down
Ruby the result of a reject from a small town
Turned into a demon, I'm evolved now
Loud growl, snow Leopard on the prowl
Stay the fuck back hoe
Slay the whole pack hoe
Paint the globe black hoe
Soon I will shed this skin, turn to the devil
Then I'll never reminisce
