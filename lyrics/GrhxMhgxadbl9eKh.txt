What's the price of it?
What's the price of it?
We're only killing ourselves each and every day
Despite what we believe, there's a difference between
Us and others
They'll offer silver and gold
The only colors they know
For these things they can't compose
'Cause they don't know what I know
We'd sell you our souls, but they're golden
And that's why it's too much for you
I'd sell you these words but I've sold them
As I'm sure you already know
You're clairvoyant (voyant)
You're clairvoyant (voyant)
You're clairvoyant (voyant)
You're clairvoyant (voyant)
You're clairvoyant (voyant)
Voyant
Voyant
Voyant
What's the price of it
If we kill ourselves a little bit?
Is it worth it?
This has no price attached to it
What's the price of it?
