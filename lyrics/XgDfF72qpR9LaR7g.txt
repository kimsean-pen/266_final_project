Muskrat, muskrat candlelight
doin' the town and doin' it right
in the evenin', it's pretty pleasin'

Muskrat Susie, Muskrat Sam
Do the jitterbug
Out in the muskrat land
And they shimmy
And Sammy's so skinny

And they whirled and they twirled and they tangoed
Singin' and jinglin' the jango
Floatin' like the heavens above
It looks like muskrat love

Nibblin' on bacon, chewin' on cheese
Sammy says to Susie
Honey, would you please be my missus?
And she says yes with her kisses

And now he's ticklin' her fancy
Rubbin' her ties
muzzle to muzzle now
anything goes
as they wiggle
and Sue starts to giggle

And they whirled and they twirled and they tangoed
Singin' and jinglin' the jango
Floatin' like the heavens above
It looks like muskrat love
