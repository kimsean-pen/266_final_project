You give me this love
You give me this love

Touch my garden
Rain clouds, mountains
Sunshine, all day long

Sunrise, meadows
Oceans, rainbows
Starlight, all day long

Golden new world
Rain clouds, mountains
Ride my pony
Ride him slowly
Smiling, all day long

You give me this love
You give me this love
You give me this love
You give me this love
