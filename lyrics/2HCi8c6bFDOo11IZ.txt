I refuse
I resist
I refuse

I refuse
I resist

Bring me to the higher reality
Bring me to the higher reality
Bring me to the higher reality
Bring me to the higher reality

Disorder, chaos, anarchy
Disorder, chaos, anarchy

Chaos A.D.
Tanks on the streets
Confronting police
Bleeding the plebs
Raging crowd
Burning cars
Bloodshed starts
Who'll be alive?!

I... Chaos A.D.
Army in siege
Total alarm
I'm sick of this
Inside the State
War is created
No man's land
What is this shit?!

Chaos A.D.
Chaos A.D.

End this – Mood chaos
End this – Mood chaos
End this – Mood chaos
Chaos A.D.

End this – Mood chaos
End this – Mood chaos
End this – Mood chaos
Chaos A.D.

End this – Mood chaos
End this – Mood chaos
End this – Mood chaos
Chaos A.D.

End this – Mood chaos
End this – Mood chaos
End this – Mood chaos
Chaos A.D.

I... Chaos A.D.
Tanks on the streets
Confronting police
Bleeding the plebs
Raging crowd
Burning cars
Bloodshed starts
Who'll be alive?!

I...
I...

Chaos A.D.
Disorder unleashed
Starting to burn
Starting to lynch
Silence means death
Stand on your feet
Inner fear
Your worst enemy

I re-
I refuse
I resist

I...
