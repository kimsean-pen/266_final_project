I've tried to visualise the moment
When you have finally left my house
But though your body left long ago
I find your spirit hangs around
I talk to you to make you leave me
But before the words have left my mouth
A hundred whispers come from the walls
And nothing I say makes it stop

Let me be
Insanity Doesn't flatter me
Let me be
I'm hearing things that you won't believe

I can't sleep when the walls keep saying your name
I can't sleep when the walls keep saying your name
Go from me and let me slumber again
I can't sleep when the walls keep saying your name

I walk around with all the lights on
When it is past the midnight hour
Oh how can such a fleeting love affair
Still behold me in its power

Let me be
Insanity doesn't flatter me
Let me be
I'm hearing things you won't believe

Well it was ok for a while
Your attention made me smile
But now you're driven wild and I can't handle it
Your passion is a curse
And I seem to make things worse
I'm gonna leave you girl, leave you girl

Let me be insanity doesn't flatter me
Let me be I'm hearing things you won't believe
Round my head incessantly possessing me
Let me be
Let me be
