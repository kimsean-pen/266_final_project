My life it feels just like
A never-ending Monday morning
Somebody wake me
From this nightmare
Will it ever end?
No, I don't like it
No color in the sky
The same old tired situation
Stuck in the place
I can't escape
I've been here way too long
All this monotony has
Gotten me nowhere but down
I'm reckless and on fire

I still remember
We did whatever
We had it all when
We were young and free
Was never better
Those were the best of times

One last thrill and always
It seemed to feel so right
What I'd give for one taste
Of one last thrill before I die

I go to work, the boss is
Clamouring for my attention
Another monologue I've heard
A million times before
No, I'm not lying
I'm bored to death
This life's been dragging
Since I don't remember

This nine to five
Like a suicide I can't endure
Whenever I don't get any time
I think I'm gonna die
I'm reckless and on fire

I still remember
I did whatever
I had it all when I
Was young and free
Was never better
Those were the best of times

One last thrill and always
It seemed to feel so right
What I'd give for one taste
Of one last thrill before I die

I wanna feel what I felt before
I wanna know there's something more
'Cause the devil down in me
It never dies
I wanna revel in ecstasy
I want the good going bad in me
Wanna live just like I'm dying
I don't wanna let this
Moment pass me by
I wave bye bye bye

-Solo-

One last thrill and always
It seemed to feel so right
What I'd give for one taste
Of one last thrill before I

One last thrill and always
It seemed to feel so right
What I'd give for one taste
Of one last thrill before I die
