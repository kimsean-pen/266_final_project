Oh come on!

I am skin and bones, broken stones
See the scars that I show
I live outside the bounds, in the unknown

I can't ingratiate to the hate
'Cause their world suffocates
Karma, your path is formed by destiny's shape
Destroy the beast
The rain is falling down upon me

Beyond the pale
I found salvation
Emancipation
Beyond the pale
I found my heroes
The freaks and zeroes

I live outside the lines, got no time
For the willfully blind
I'll build a world of my step on size

I'll break down every wall, fght and claw
Take their punches, stand tall
My middle finger raises, so fuck 'em all

The rain is falling down upon me

Beyond the pale
I found salvation
Emancipation
Beyond the pale
I found my heroes
The freaks and zeroes

Weather the storm
My heart is drowning
The rain is falling down upon me

Beyond the pale, I found salvation
Emancipation
Beyond the pale, I found my heroes
The freaks and zeroes

Beyond the pale

Beyond the pale

Beyond the pale

Beyond the pale
