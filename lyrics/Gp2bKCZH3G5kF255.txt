I'm lucky to be where I am today.
Not by myself, summers on the way.
The jobs I'll be working, the money I'll spend, not making a living,
just making new friends.
And I'm trying my hardest to make the most out of every minute.
Not getting any younger, getting older. it's scary.

Swept out from under your feet your youth's gone and you wonder why...
BECAUSE TIME FLIES

How much does it cost the booze and the drugs you need.
Put your life on pause.
Is it that much fun, maybe for some.
I think its dumb to let anyone or anything slow me down or prevent me from living my life.
Not getting younger, getting older.
It's scary.
Swept out from under your feet your youth's gone and you wonder why.

Work machine makes us old before our time.
I don't consent that's how I feel.
Because life's too short, so I do what I can to get by.
I'll decide where my time is spent and you can bet there'll be a smile on my face.
How about yours? How about yours!?
