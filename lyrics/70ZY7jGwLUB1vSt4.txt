Baby girl, I say tonight is your lucky night
Peter Andre along with Bubbler Ranx pon de micc

I stop and stare at you, walking on the shore
I try to concentrate, my mind wants to explore
The tropical scent of you, takes me up above
And girl and when I look at you, oh I fall in love

(Oh, oh)hygcghdjdytdtydt
No doubt you look so fine
(Oh, oh)
Girl I wanna make you mine
(Oh, oh)
I want to be with a woman just like you

(Oh, oh)
No doubt I'm the only man
(Oh, oh)
Who can love you like I can
(Oh, oh)
So just let me be with the woman that I love
(Oh, oh)

Baby girl, shine like looking glass

Oh oh oh, mysterious girl
I wanna get close to you
Oh oh oh, mysterious girl
Move your body close to mine, close to mine

Girl you are my hearts desire
And you alone set me soul on fire
Me tell dem girl you are me hearts desire
Are you alone? Watch dis

Watching the sun go down, the tide is drifting in
(ohh)
We can get closer now and feel the warmth within
'Cause I'm lookin in' your eyes, feeling so alive
And girl when you touch me, it's time to take it through the night

(Oh, oh)
Girl I wanna be with you
(Oh, oh)
I wanna spend the night with you
(Oh, oh)
I need to be with woman that I love

(Oh, oh)
Girl I wanna do to you

(Oh, oh)

Baby girl, let your loving release

(Oh oh oh, mysterious girl
I wanna get close to you)
So close to you my baby
(Oh oh oh, mysterious girl
Move your body close to mine)

Well I've been sittin' by the fone hoping you'd call
When time me your voice I feel ten feet tall
Body weh you move a make de man dem a bawl
Man a tripover man when time your name call

Pretty looks surround me like a flowers a bloom
And I love the smell of your Elizabeth Taylor perfume
Personality alone light up de room
Jus one kiss alone make me heart go boom
(Oh oh oh, mysterious girl
I wanna get close to you)
C'mon now, c'mon now
(Oh oh oh, mysterious girl
Move your body close to mine)
Girl you are my hearts desire
Are you alone? And set me soul on fire
Oh oh oh, mysterious girl
