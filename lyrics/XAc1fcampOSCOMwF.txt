Hey DJ love the way
I lose my inhibitions when you spin
And I don't care if people stare
I'd rather boogie than try to fit in

Turn it up let 'em scrutinize
(I know you're watching)
Way up 'cause the night is mine
(I know you're watching)
Turn it up lemme scandalize
(I know you're watching)
Yeah up under flashing lights
No don't be jealous of my boogie

Don't be jealous of my boogie
Don't be jealous of my boogie
You can say that you are not
But I always see you looking
Don't be jealous of my boogie
Don't be jealous of my boogie
You can say that you are not
But I always see you looking
Don't be jealous of my boogie
Don't be jealous of my boogie
You can say that you are not
But I always see you looking
Don't be jealous of my boogie
Don't be jealous of my boogie
You can say that you are not
But I always see you looking

Can't stop now won't slow down
I gotta emulate the BPM
I hit the scene and they turn green
It can't be easy I don't envy them

Turn it up let 'em scrutinize
(I know you're watching)
Way up 'cause the night is mine
(I know you're watching)
Turn it up lemme scandalize
(I know you're watching)
Yeah up under flashing lights
No don't be jealous of my boogie

Don't be jealous of my boogie
Don't be jealous of my boogie
You can say that you are not
But I always see you looking
Don't be jealous of my boogie
Don't be jealous of my boogie
You can say that you are not
But I always see you looking
Don't be jealous of my boogie
Don't be jealous of my boogie
You can say that you are not
But I always see you looking
Don't be jealous of my boogie
Don't be jealous of my boogie
You can say that you are not
But I always see you looking

I know you watch it
I know you watch it
I know you watch it
I see you looking
I know you watch it
I know you watch it
I know you watch it
I see you looking

Don't be jealous of my boogie
Don't be jealous of my boogie
You can say that you are not
But I always see you looking
Don't be jealous of my boogie
Don't be jealous of my boogie
You can say that you are not
But I always see you looking
Don't be jealous of my boogie
Don't be jealous of my boogie
You can say that you are not
But I always see you looking
Don't be jealous of my boogie
Don't be jealous of my boogie
You can say that you are not
But I always see you looking
Don't be jealous of my boogie
Don't be jealous of my boogie
You can say that you are not
But I always see you looking
Don't be jealous of my boogie
Don't be jealous of my boogie
You can say that you are not
But I always see you looking
