When I look into your eyes
There's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes
Staring back at me

I've lied to you...

This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you

Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
Everything has to end, you'll soon find (For the sake of being with you)
We're out of time left to watch it all unwind
Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down

The sacrifice is never knowing...

Why I stay
When you just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me

I've tried, like you
To do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you

Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
(The sacrifice of hiding in a lie)
Everything has to end, you'll soon find
We're out of time left to watch it all unwind

The sacrifice is never knowing...

Why I stay
When you just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me

Reverse psychology, failing miserably
It's so hard to be left all alone
Telling you is the only chance for me
There's nothing left but to turn and face you

When I look into your eyes
There's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes
Staring back at me

Asking why...

The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
The sacrifice is never knowing
Why I stay
When you just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me

Why I stay
When you just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me
