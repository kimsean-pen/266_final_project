The intimacy of makeup counters
There's not enough products and powders
You can put on me
The touch of your hand to my face
And the way that you're talkin' softly
It's not enough attention for me

How you gonna fill unfillable
How you gonna feel unfeelable
You're passing up on the real stuff
It's not physical enough
You're passing up on the real stuff
It's not physical
You're passing up on the real stuff
It's not nearly

Even with your soft obsession
It's not enough attention for me
Even with another mention
You should've made a difference by now

Even with your soft obsession
It's not enough attention for me
Even with another mention
It's not nearly physical enough

But if we wrap ourselves in waves of light
And we affix the stars to the sky
They'll hold their light
For just a little longer
Before the Sun rises and falls
Do you feel everything and then nothing

How you gonna fill unfillable
How you gonna feel unfeelable
You're passing up on the real stuff
And you're waking up on stars
You're passing up on the real stuff
It's not nearly physical enough
You're passing up on the real stuff
It's not nearly

Even with your soft obsession
It's not enough attention for me
Even with another mention
You should've made a difference by now

Even with your soft obsession
It's not enough attention on me
Even with another mention
It's not nearly physical enough

The way you're talking softly
And your attention on me
It's not physical enough

The way you're talking softly
And your attention on me
It's not physical enough
You're passing up on the real stuff
It's not nearly
You're passing up on the real stuff
It's not nearly
