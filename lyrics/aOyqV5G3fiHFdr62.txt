Another drink, another smoke
I let them burn, inside my throat
Like a bully bleeds from his knuckles out
In a darkened room quiet and alone

(Quiet and alone)
(Quiet and alone)
(Quiet and alone)

Because we all
Need to feel release
Because we all
Wanna be at peace
Because we all
Need to feel release
Because we all
Wanna be at peace

All alone, I've lost the hope
That I'll find myself again
There's a heart so cold within me
It feels like February

It doesn't hurt
But I know it will
You'll see me again
Even darker stone
And an early grave
Weighs me to the ground
But I gently rest
Quiet and alone
(Quiet and alone)

Because we all
Need to feel release
Because we all
Wanna be at peace
Because we all
Need to feel release
Because we all
Wanna be at peace

All alone, I've lost the hope
That I'll find myself again
There's a heart so cold within me
It feels like February

Despite all the pain, the tears and the rain
It's got to get better
No matter how lost, no matter the cost
It's got to get better
The infinite fall, the distance I crawl
It's got to get better
And maybe I'm wrong, but I pray that I'm not
It's got to get better

It's got to get better
It's got to get better
It's got to get better
It's got to get better

It's got to get better
It's got to get better
It's got to get better
It's got to get better
