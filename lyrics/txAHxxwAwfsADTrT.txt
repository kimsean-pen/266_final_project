With a gun in your hand
I'm the boogieman

I'm gonna come and get you

If you point a gun at my rising sun
Though we're not the one
But in the bounds of your mind
We have done the crime, yeah

Boogieman, you've got to help us, can you?
(Yes you can)
Boogieman, you've got to help us, can you? Yes you can

With a gun in your hand
I'm the boogieman, boogieman
I'm gonna come and get you

Every boy and girl all around the world
Knows my niggas' words
But if he's scared of me, how can we be free?
Yes

Boogieman, yes
You've got to help us, can you?
(Yes you can, oh)
Boogieman, yes
You've got to help us, can you?
(Yes you can, oh)

Boogieman
