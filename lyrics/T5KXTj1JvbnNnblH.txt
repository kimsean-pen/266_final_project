I've spent all summer days driving
I'm tired of holidays ruined
No more take-away's, expired food
I need a real day
Time runs faster when you're loaded
Bright lights blind me all weak
Living in the city, I'm a high-speed drill
I need a full day diving
Tons of heavyweight food
Roosters from the sister islands too
I'd better get working
I'm bored with all that brainwashing
Let's break all separate rooms
Changing's no fun if you don't want to
I need a good day sailing
To tell the sun and the moon
That I am turning for no reasons too
And I keep waiting
Driving to the gas station
Caught by a traffic jam blues
Life is nonsense, I don't have a clue
I need a cool day riding
Feeding all the horses at dawn
Searching for the truffles, going through the woods
Then I'll be waiting
I've passed all summer days driving
I'm tired of holidays ruined
No more take-away's, expired food
I need a full day diving
Tons of heavyweight food
Roosters from the sister islands too
I'd better get working
