hello to you hello to me
i've somewhere else to be
excuses i get all the time
your answers i don't see
today is easy isn't it so?
i sit and watch the radio
there's nothing coming on at all
hello to you hello to me
ah yeah i really care
i'll see you all around sometime
i hope that i'm not there
today's news is yesterday's news
you don't remember you forget
that's the way the stories all go
hello to you hello to me
and yes i really care
i'll see you all around sometime
if i ever go back there
goodbye to you goodbye again
i've got to get this train
it's nine o' clock already
and i'm twenty minutes late
goodbye to you goodbye again
problems don't exist
i'll see you at the station
you'll be standing in the rain
today is easy isn't it so?
the man says stop
the clock says now
it's exit time for me
goodnight to you goodnight again
i've somewhere else to be
i'll see you all around sometime
i hope you don't miss me
goodbye to you good bye to you
goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye
goodbye to you
goodbye
