You had the blue note sapphire eyes
To back up all those gazes
To pierce my guard and to take my soul off
To faraway places
Told me I'll never be alone
Cos you're right there

We took a gamble with this love
Like sailing to the storm
With the waves rushing over to take us
We were battling against the tide
You were my beacon of salvation
I was your starlight

So don't cry for your love
Cry tears of joy
Cos you're alive
Cradled in love
Don't cry for your love
Cry tears of joy
Cos you're alive
Cradled in love

I kept the love you gave me alive
And now I carry it with me
I know it's just a tear drop from mother earth
But in it I can hear a dolphin sing
Telling me I'll never be alone
I know you're right there

So with the fire still burning bright
I wanna gaze into your light
If I could see my fortune there
You know how flames can hypnotize
Do I even dare to speak out your name for fear
It sounds like
Like a lover

So don't cry for your love
Cry tears of joy
Cos you're alive
Cradled in love
Don't cry for your love
Cry tears of joy
Cos you're alive
Cradled in love
Don't cry for your love
Cry tears of joy
Cos you're alive
Cradled in love
Don't cry for your love
Cry tears of joy
Cos you're alive
Cradled in love ...
