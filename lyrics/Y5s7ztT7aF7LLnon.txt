And all that I see are
The either or's and I'm still yours
And I'm slipping out the way I choose
Like soft, slight Sunday blues

And all that I taste now
Faint Manila, so familiar

Flying gulls raging in the wind
Race the ships, wings guided by the waves
Pressure at bay, tension's here to stay
The Gulf Coast way

And all that I take now is my time
You're so graceful, holding but losing us
It's great how you're so selfless with our shared life

You're untouchable, stunning
I'm drowning in this sea
Your love all the time
It's ours if you say so

Just want something more to take a hold of
When everything turns out differently
I'll keep promising and listening to the loons

All that I take now is my time
You're so patient, holding but losing us
It's great how I'm so selfish with our shared life

And all that I taste now
Faint Manila, so familiar
I'm yours
