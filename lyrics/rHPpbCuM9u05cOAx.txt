When I hear that rock and roll
It gets down to my soul
When it's real rock and roll, oh, rock and roll
When I hear that rock and roll
It gets down to my soul
When it's real rock and roll, oh, rock and roll

Ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

You really think they like to rock in space?
Well, I don't know
What do you know?
What do you hear on the radio?
Coming through the air
I said, "Momma, I ain't crazy
I'm all right, all right"

Hey
C'mon, baby, said it's all right
To rock 'n' roll on a Saturday night
I said, "Shoot and get your suit, and come along with me"
I said, "C'mon, baby, down, come and rock with me"
I said, "Yeah"

What do you do
To get to feel alive?
You go downtown
And get some of that prime jive
I said, "Momma, I ain't crazy
I'm all right, all right"

Hey
C'mon, baby, said it's all right
To rock 'n' roll on a Saturday night
I said, "Shoot and get your suit, and come along with me"
I said, "C'mon, baby, down, come and rock with me"
I said, "Yeah"
We're gonna rock it

Hey
C'mon, baby, said it's all right
To rock 'n' roll on a Saturday night
I said, "Shoot and get your suit, and come along with me"
I said, "C'mon, baby, down, come and rock with me"
I said, "Yeah"
