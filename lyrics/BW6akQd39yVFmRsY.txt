I never thought I'd kill myself
I'm doing it so the rest can survive
Mass murder through suicide
Master of my own fate, martyrdom derived from hate

I died so you can live
With a bomb tied to my chest I approach the president
Chaos, as bombs explode burning flesh and skin
Now your country's leader's dead and the war is ours to win
