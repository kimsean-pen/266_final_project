Star Spangled Banner (live)

O! say can you see, by the dawn's early light
what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
whose broad stripes and bright star through the perilous fight
for the reparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming
and the rockets red glare and bombs bursting in air
gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
O! say does that star spangled banner yet wave
for the land of the free
and the home of the brave
