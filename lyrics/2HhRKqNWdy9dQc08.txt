In the town where I grew up
I met a girl
She was lovely enough
I said to her
Would you like to fall in love with me?
Oh, tell me girl
Would you like to fall in love with me?
Now, tell me girl
Well, you know she took my hand
And we walked away
And I can't understand why she would stay
Would you like to fall in love with me?
Now, tell me girl
Would you like to fall in love with me?
Now, tell me girl
Would you like to fall in love with me?
Now, tell me girl
Would you like to fall in love with me?
Now, tell me girl
