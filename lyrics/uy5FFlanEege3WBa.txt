Oh don't you move
Oh don't you move
There's another lucid colour
Coming for you soon

Oh don't you move
Oh don't you move
There's another lucid colour
Coming for you soon

Float outside in the fields of gold
Where the sunlight meets dandelion

Float outside in the fields of gold
Where the sunlight meets dandelion

I'm in the mood
I'm in the mood
For another lucid colour
What is there to lose?

I'm in the mood
I'm in the mood
For another lucid colour

Float outside in the fields of gold
Where the sunlight meets dandelion

Float outside in the fields of gold
Where the sunlight meets dandelion

Wander up mountains
Wander up mountains
Wander up mountains
Wander up mountains
Wander up mountains
Wander up mountains
Wander up mountains
Wander up mountains
