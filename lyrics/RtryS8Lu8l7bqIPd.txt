Coffee burns, the stomach churns
Chemicals and caffeine
You saw her bathing in the creek
Are you jealous of the water?
Are you jealous of the water?

Now babe, if it's alright I call you that
I've been running solo, but it ain't all that
They say it's the take and give
All that emptiness knows just where I live
Yeah that emptiness knows me

Was it just, chemicals in my head
Just, chemicals in my head

Tell me why all these pages are flying round in the yard
How my hands can't seem to find your hands in the dark
Tell me, tell me how the hell did we get all the way up here

How gravity's gone
Gravity's gone
How gravity's gone
