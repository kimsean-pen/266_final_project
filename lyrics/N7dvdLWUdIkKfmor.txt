All the words,
All the sin in me you have forsaken.

Always you said to me that all is forgiven.
But suddenly there's nothing left,
Nothing there except what you have taken.

Then one day you'll sleep again,
Sleep again and then you'll be forgotten.
And now you've just left me there
With all the sins and words you left unspoken.

All the words. All the words.

Suddenly there's nothing left,
Except the sins and words you have forsaken.
Then one day you'll sleep again,
Sleep again and then you'll be forgotten.
Because there will be nothing left,
Nothing left except what you have taken.

And then you are on your way,
Honestly with all that you've forsaken.

All the words. All the world forsaken.

And there will be nothing left.
All remains is that what you have taken.
Then one day you'll sleep again,
In your own bed.
And then you'll be forgotten.
