Come to see me
I will show you
The island of the roses

Come to love me
I will play you
With fearless temptation

Close your eyes and leave the empty grail
Taste the sweet wine from my lips
Face your virgin bride without a veil
And I will forgive you all your sins

Dance with me the dance of fire
Feel our worlds colliding
Join me in my cold desire
Last for you to see will be my eyes

A beautiful evil cursed with heart of stone
Feed my hunger with your kiss
Taking a life tonight is mine alone
Give me a luscious sigh of bliss

Dance with me the dance of fire
Feel our worlds colliding
Join me in my cold desire
Last for me to see will be your eyes

Come to see me
You will find my
Truth in the reflection

Come to love me
I will call you
The daughter of the darkness

Come to see me
You can call me
The daughter of the darkness

Come to love me
I will play you
With fearless temptation

Come to see me
You will find my / I will find your
Truth in the reflection

Come to love me
I will have you suffer in perfection
