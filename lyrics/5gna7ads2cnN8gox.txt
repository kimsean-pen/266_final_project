I can see you with your brothers
And your homes have been blessed
But you walk in a rubble
You walk in a mess
Looking for trouble
There's a fox in the nest
Kick up your heels on the double
Put the mocking to rest

I am a fire if you hesitate
Bang bang hurry up
But you watch with the eyes
In the jaws of a boy
Who will never recognize his luck

I am a fire if you hesitate
Tie your laces up
But you watch with the eyes
In the jaws of a boy
Who is never gonna come unstuck

What you say undercover
In the belly of the beast
Blaze a trail at their pace
Jump up for the peak
As the words pile up
Like an accident
Its just semantics

I am a fire if you hesitate
Bang bang hurry up
But you watch with the eyes
In the jaws of a boy
Who will never recognize his luck

I am a fire if you hesitate
Tie your laces up
But you watch with the eyes
In the jaws of a boy
Who is never gonna come unstuck

This is how he sees it
This is how he works
This is how he functions
I know why it hurts
I can hear him heaving
Watch me take a word and turn it into magic

This is how he sees it
This is how he works
This is how he functions
I know why it hurts
I can hear him heaving
Watch me take a word and turn it into magic

This is how he sees it
This is how he works
This is how he functions
I know why it hurts
I can hear him heaving
Watch me take a word and turn it into magic
