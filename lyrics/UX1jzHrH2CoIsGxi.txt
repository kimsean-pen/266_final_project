My painted face
I'm a clown
And I'm laughing while my dream turns into a nightmare
Fade away
I'm asleep
Not too deep

The walls of night
Have left me scarred
The broken glass
I stepped on, twice.
The ardent spirits'
Rusty edge, decapitate me

I can't sleep
Fear darkness
Go through the motions
Did I fall asleep?
I'm bowling
The old nine pin, a sign unwanted

Now I'm a target
I'm hot and frozen,
Stormy rain
I'm stuck in an elevator
Breathing hot air
Winds convey me

The number talks
And I cry in my own Hell
Wide awake, I'm asleep,
See a friend as a ghost

I'm skating with a seal,
(I'm skating with a seal)
The tarantula, the fly,
The broken ring
The dusty little flea
(The dusty little flea)
An ugly giant,
A disappointed child

Here comes the rabid snake
(Here comes the rabid snake)
The broken violin,
A wild ballet
Shakespeare and company
Refuse to kill the kitten scratching me

I'm falling, I'm falling
I'm falling, I'm falling
I'm falling, I'm falling
Awake

You know, if you believe the dreams,
The nightly visions, worlds entwined
Then you also fear your shadow
Paranoia, part two

All the good things in my life
Dwell in my mind
Took a wrong lane, every day,
I hear myself say
Sickening's this feeling, my life, my hopes,
My dream's but a drop of fuel for a nightmare

They all turn out the same
My destiny, my flame
Believing is control?
No.
The painting comes alive,
Takes me inside a world without a name,
A place beyond compare

Believe the dreams
That let you sleep
The broken glass
You need to sweep

The book you read;
If you found an explanation
To help you in any way,
You are your own prison.

Woke up today,
The good and the bad and the ugly dreams are gone
Jumped off the carousel
