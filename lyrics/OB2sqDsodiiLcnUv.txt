I've had California dreamin'
and I've had California turn on me,
you can believe in that.
You can believe in that.

I found truth in the aftermath
and got everything that ever really mattered back,
you can believe in that.
You can believe in that.

I won't be compromised.
I know how to survive the worst that you can give.
And I will never, ever go away,
I can pull myself out of the grave,
you can believe in that.
You can believe in that.

Step back and watch the show,
hear the cry on the Citizen Radio.
We will be heard before the curtains close.
The voice of the unknown,
hear the cry on the Citizen Radio.
We'll always be the ones who told you so.

And I've seen another future through,
the broken hearts down Union Avenue,
you can believe in that.
You can believe in that.

And I've had to wait long enough,
I can't turn back now, there's no givin' up,
you can believe in that.
You can believe in that.

I won't be used again.
I've learned how to defend myself against the world.
Step back and watch the show,
hear the cry on the Citizen Radio.
We will be heard before the curtains close.
The voice of the unknown,
hear the cry on the Citizen Radio.
We'll always be the ones who told you so.

I won't be compromised,
I know how to survive the worst that you can give.
I won't be used again,
I've learned how to defend myself against the world.

And I found that perfect love,
but she could never understand where I was coming from,
you can believe in that.
You can believe in that.

And I've had friends walk away,
I will never understand the choice they made,
you can believe in that.
You can believe in that.

Step back and watch the show,
hear the cry on the Citizen Radio.
We will be heard before the curtains close.
The voice of the unknown,
hear the cry on the Citizen Radio.
We'll always be the ones who told you so.

I TOLD YOU SO.
I'm holdin' on.
I TOLD YOU SO.
I'm holdin' on.
