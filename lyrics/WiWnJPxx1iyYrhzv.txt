Stab a sorry heart
with your favourite finger
paint the whole world blue
and stop your tears from stinging
hear the cavemen singing
good news they're bringing
Seven seas
swimming them so well
glad to see
my face among them
kissing the tortoise shell
A longing for
some fresher feeling
belonging
or just forever kneeling
where is the sense in stealing
without the grace to be it
Seven seas
swimming them so well
glad to see
my face among them
kissing the tortoise shell
Burning my bridges
and smashing my mirrors
turning to see if you're cowardly
burning the witches with mother religious
you'll strike the matches and shower me
in water games
washing the rocks below
taught and tamed
in time with tear flow
Seven seas
swimming them so well
glad to see
my face among them
kissing the tortoise shell
Seven seas
swimming them so well
glad to see
my face among them
kissing the tortoise
Seven seas
swimming them so well
glad to see
my face among them
kissing the tortoise shell
