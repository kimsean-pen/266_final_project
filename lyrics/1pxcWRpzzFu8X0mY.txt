Here I am on my own again
the days rush by
the nights all seems so slow
guess I've let you down
in my way, some how
if you take me back
I know we'll make it
we'll make a promise
and then break it

On my honor I will try
always do the best I can
though the tears
may fall like raindrops
from my eyes honey
on my honor I will try

If you want me to be strong
I'll give it everything I have
you'll never have to worry
cause we're not in a hurry
on my honor I will try

It's a lover's dance
in a fiery chant
don't be afraid to face the music now
It's a gambler's chance
not a lost romance
and I'm not you
and you're not me and
sometimes we feel differently

On my honor I will try
always do the best I can
though the tears
may fall like raindrops
from my eyes honey
on my honor I will try
if you want me to be strong
I'll give it everything I have
you'll never have to worry
cause we're not in a hurry
on my honor I will try
I will try
I will try
I'll try
