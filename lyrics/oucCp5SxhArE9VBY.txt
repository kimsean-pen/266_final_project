Maybe
I know it's just maybe.
And we're only dreaming
For how this will go

But maybe,
One day this daydream
Will turn into real things
For all that we know

We could be doing anything that we love
Just be carried by the way the wind blows on
You could be doing anything you dream of
If you believe in the things that make you strong

Someday
We'll meet on the high street
We'll laugh about when we
Worried about what we might be

Then maybe
We'll talk about old days
We'll smile in our old ways
You'll always be a part of me

We could be doing anything that we love
Just be carried by the way the wind blows on
You could be doing anything you dream of
If you believe in the things that make you strong

You could be doing anything you dream of
If you believe in the things that make you strong

Maybe, I know its just maybe
And we're only dreaming
For how this will go
Just maybe
(You could be doing anthing you dream of)
Maybe, maybe
