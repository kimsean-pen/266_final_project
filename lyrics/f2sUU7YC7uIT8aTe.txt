Even an angel can end up falling
Don't you cry, because you're crawling
Start again, it's a beautiful morning
For satellites

Well, they said it was time for changing
Rise and shine
Everybody's making it, but you
And they told you to trust your dreaming
But it's hard to believe a feeling
That you just don't know

Even an angel can end up falling
Don't you cry, because you're crawling
Start again, it's a beautiful morning
For satellites
Even an angel can end up falling
Don't you cry, because you're crawling
Start again, it's a beautiful morning
For satellites

You can try and walk on water
In the end everybody
Walks all over you
No, you don't like the sight of mirrors
'Cause you're scared that the face will see
Will look just like before

Even an angel can end up falling
Don't you cry, because you're crawling
Start again, it's a beautiful morning
For satellites
Even an angel can end up falling
Don't you cry, because you're crawling
Start again, it's a beautiful morning
For satellites

All I want is you
Let me take you back where you once belong
All I want is you
It will be alright if you come along
You were never gone

Even an angel can end up falling
Don't you cry, because you're crawling
Start again, it's a beautiful morning
For satellites

Even an angel can end up falling
Don't you cry, because you're crawling
Start again, it's a beautiful morning
For satellites
Even an angel can end up falling
Don't you cry, because you're crawling
Start again, it's a beautiful morning
For satellites
