She's going shopping, shopping for shoes
She want 'em in magenta and Caribbean blue
Platinum and buttercup, lilac and black
They fill a bucket up and laugh behind her back

Imelda, baby
Imelda, baby, what to do?
All the poor people saying
That they got to quit paying for you

In New York and Paris, on the Champs Elysee
They see her coming from a long, long way
Yeah, they clap their hands together
When they get her in the store
Oh, she's gonna want to get more, more, more
And more, and more

Imelda, baby
Imelda, baby, what to do?
All the poor people saying
That they got to quit paying for you

Everyone's gone Jackie-O
She was a regular here
We thought Madame would like to know
We've got the blood red rouge right here

Now, we've got all of Madame's requisites
And all in Madame's size
Madame's taste is truly exquisite, she must accessorize
Yeah, the belts are alligator, the bags are kangaroo
Enchante may I say, the jade was made for you

Imelda, baby
Imelda, baby, what to do?
All the poor people saying
That they got to quit paying for you
Yeah, all the poor people saying
They got to quit paying for you

Imelda, baby
Imelda, baby, what to do?
All the poor people saying
That they got to quit paying for you
Yeah, all the poor people saying
That they got to quit paying for you
