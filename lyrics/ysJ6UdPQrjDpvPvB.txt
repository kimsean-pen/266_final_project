Flaunting my body, my body
To people who just
Think I'm somebody who sung a
Song that they knew
And they edit my body so good that
They'll never know that I faked it
And lately I'm getting too drunk at
The same old club
So I'm living my life on a budget
Tryna find love but
I don't want a lover who
I'm only gonna love when I'm wasted

I want something sacred
I want something amazing
And I'm going through changes
I want something sacred

I've been taking the money, the money
Put on a face
But inside I feel funny, feel dirty, feel outta place
And it's part of the journey, they tell me
But I just want to escape this
'Cause I know strangers better than my friends
Hooked on celebrity, doped up on jealousy
All these people just play pretend
There ain't no integrity, no

I want something sacred
I want something amazing
And I'm going through changes
I want something sacred
I want something
I want something
I want something sacred
I want something sacred
Sacred
