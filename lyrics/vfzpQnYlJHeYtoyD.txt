Lilac, I miss you were my little lilac*
O lilac
I trust you can't remember most so rest your head now,
Your head now
Lilac i feel your last you last lies come straight from her eyes,
To my eyes
Tonight, should you rise above, I regret love,
I regret love
And you have ghost hands on, that can't hold you up
And you have ghost hands on, I can't hold you up.
I gotta let you...
I gotta let you live
I gotta let you...
Lilac, I miss you were my little my lilac,
My lilac.
I trust you can't remember most so rest your head now,
Your head now.
And you have ghost hands on that can't hold you up.
And you have ghosts hands on I can't hold you up.
I can't hold you up...
