If you've never been in love
And you're longing for the happiness it brings
Try your wings

If you're hungry for the sound
Of a lover saying sentimental things
Try your wings

Even the tiniest bluebird
Has to leave its nest to fly
What a bluebird can do
You can do too, if you try

If you've always had a dream
But you've been afraid that it would not come true, hitherto
Fall in love and you will find
That it's just what you've been dreaming of

A first love never comes twice
So take this tender advice
When it comes, try your wings
And fly to the one you love
