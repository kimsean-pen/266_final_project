I found the answer in a room with no obscurity
(Remember me)
Remember me
The broken pieces of the puzzle
That we choose to leave
I'd rather see

Will you remember
Will you remember me
Losing light all the time
Just to find what I believe in
Know me by name
Yeah, yeah know me by my name

Rip out my heart, tear me apart
Just another casualty in
The songs you'll never see
Rip out my heart, tear me apart
Leave behind my legacy just to find my destiny
I set the enemy you'll see

You cast me down
Take the crown
Hear the sound
Know me by name
This is how the world remembers me

Rip out my heart, tear me apart
Just another casualty
In the songs you'll never see
Rip out my heart, tear me apart
This is who I'll always be
How the world remembers

(Rip out my heart, tear me apart)
(Rip out my heart, tear me apart)
This is how the world remembers
(Rip out my heart, tear me apart)
This is how the world remembers

You cast me down
Take the crown
Hear the sound
Know me by my name

Know me by my name
Cast me down
Take the crown
Hear the sound
Know me by my name

But when all these are removed and
You can look forward and
the road is clear ahead
And now you're going to create something
I think that's as happy as I'll ever want to be
