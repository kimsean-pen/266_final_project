You think that you're playing me
But I'm playing you
You think that you're playing me
But I'm playing you
You think that you're playing me
But I'm playing you
You think that you're playing me
Drama tears the sky in two

Trouble in the skies
It colours over everything

You come over me
Summer rain
You come over me
Summer rain
You come over me
Summer rain
You come over me
And I'm in heaven

I take it on like a new fever
I take it on like a new fever

You got me feeling that my shirt's on fire
There's trouble in the skies

You come over me
Summer rain
You come over me
Summer rain
You come over me
Like summer rain
You come over me
And I'm in heaven

There's drama in the skies
It colours over everything
You got me feeling that my shirts on fire
There's trouble in the skies

You come over me
Summer rain
You come over me
Summer rain
You come over me
Like summer rain
You come over me
And I'm in heaven

You think that you're playing me
But I'm playing you
You think that you're playing me
Drama tears the sky in two

You come over me
Summer rain
You come over me
Summer rain
You come over me
Like summer rain
You come over me
And I'm in heaven

I take it on like a new fever

I take it on like a new fever

I take it on like a new fever
