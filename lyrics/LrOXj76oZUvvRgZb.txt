I miss counting the stars
And I miss the way you kiss me
I miss the way you touch me
I miss calling you mine
Baby, you know who I am
And there's nobody I'd rather be
And dance with in the moonlight
I just want to go back

I fear the emptiness...
Will swallow me whole
This is my confession

I am no hero!
(And I'm not a saint)
I can't save the world
(And I never asked for this)
In your eyes I see the questions I don't have the answers for
Arise! Suspicious minds

I miss counting the stars

You told yourself I was pure
Certain that I would save you
But if it crosses your mind (That I was saving myself)
Remind yourself that I'm dangerous!

Maybe I'm not as honest as it seems
(A siren dressed in silk)
Maybe I'm just selling a lie
(A villain in disguise)

I fear the emptiness...
Will swallow me whole
This is my confession

I am no hero!
(And I'm not a saint)
I can't save the world
(And I never asked for this)
In your eyes I see the questions I don't have the answers for
Arise! Suspicious minds

I don't know if I'm praying, I don't know if I'm begging
But I have to believe that someone
Something out there can hear me
I have to know that there is a chance
I have to believe that I might escape this hell
I fear I've lost myself, and I don't know the way back
The way back to what I once was
Am I Fatima? Am I Rusalka?
Or am I just me?
Sweet, innocent Annabel...

Star crossed lovers in strife (Time to move on...)
Embracing on a battlefield (...to another night)
Giving in to the fight (Time to move on...)
Changing at the speed of light (...to another fight)

I fear the emptiness...
Will swallow me whole
This is my confession
