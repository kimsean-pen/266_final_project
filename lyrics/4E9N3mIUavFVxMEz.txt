You dream a dream
But you never wake up
You're so afraid
That the dream is over
Open your eyes and you'll see
Daydreaming won't conquer me (won't conquer me)
No it won't conquer me
Cause only the good guys can get
What they're coming for
And all of the dreamers must take what's apart
Only the good guys receive
What they came here for
And all you dreamers
Will leave with a broken heart

Reality
You better face it
Your blood is red
One bite - you'll taste it
Open your eyes and you'll see
Daydreaming won't conquer me
No it won't conquer me
Only the good guys can get
What they're coming for
All of the dreamer must take what's apart
Only the good guys receive
What they came here for
And all you dreamers
Will leave with a broken heart
