I'm not scared, but this is happening,
I'm not afraid, but this is real, this is real
I'll count the ways, from every single direction
This time I'm not, I'm not sleeping at all

How could this be real
I've failed You, I've failed You

I was lying when I said, I was looking north
I was too scared to show what I am
Bear with me, bear with me, this is all I have left
This might be more than a simple conversation

It's been dancing around my head
For quite some time
Just a thought of cleaning up myself

I was lying when I said, I was looking north
I was too scared to show what I am
Bear with me, bear with me, this was all I had left
This might be more than a simple conversation

I'm not sleeping
I'm not sleeping at all,
I stare at the wall, watching my time float away
Its all been a blur, and nothing will change
I stare at the wall, watching my time float away
Its all been a blur, and nothing will change
I was lying (I WAS LYING) I was lying (I WAS LYING)
This is defeat.
