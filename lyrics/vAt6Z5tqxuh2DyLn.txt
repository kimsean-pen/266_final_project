Start wearing purple, wearing purple
Start wearing purple for me now
All your sanity and wits, they will all vanish
I promise, it's just a matter of time

I know you since you were a twenty and I was twenty
But thought that some years from now
A purple little little lady will be perfect
For dirty old and useless clown

So yeah, start wearing purple, wearing purple!
Start wearing purple for me now!
All your sanity and wits, they will all vanish,
I promise, it's just a matter of time!

I know it all from Diogenis to Foucault
From Lozgechkin to Paspartu
I ia klianus obossav dva paltza
Chto muzika poshla ot Zvukov Mu!

Start wearing purple, wearing purple!
Start wearing purple for me now!
All your sanity and wits, they will all vanish
I promise, it's just a matter of time!

So yeah, start wearing purple wearing purple!
Start wearing purple for me now!
So why don't you start wearing purple?
Why don't you start wearing purple
Start wearing purple for me now!
Tantsi!

All your sanity and wits, they will all vanish
I promise, it's just a matter of time!

So Fio-Fio-Fioletta! Eta!
Da-da-dadama ti moia!
Eh, podaite nam karetu, vot etu!
I mi poedem k ebeniam!

So yeah, start wearing purple wearing purple!
Start wearing purple for me now!
All your sanity and wits, they will all vanish,
I promise, it's just a matter of time!
