I'm a monster
I am on fire, I'm blooming, baby
Why don't you care for me anymore?
Just like the morning when you're gone
I've been believing that you'll carry me away
But I don't see no horse, and no carriage

There must be more to life than this
Am I a fool to believe that maybe
If I could shift these parts around
By catalysis or brawn
I'd get something back?

Keep me high, keep me thin
Carry on, keep it in
But I don't feel nothing, anymore
I don't feel nothing, anymore
I try to keep my head on straight
But I don't feel nothing, anymore

I don't feel nothing, anymore
I don't feel nothing, anymore
I try, I try to keep my head on straight
But I don't feel nothing, anymore
