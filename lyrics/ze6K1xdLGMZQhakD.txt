Oh my God, you're so hot
Hold my hair, let me get on top
Oh my God, soaking wet
Back and forth 'til we break the bed

When you read my mind, get down and discover me

Wanna put my hands around your neck
Gonna take you to a place that you will not forget

Oh my God, soaking wet
Back and forth 'til we break the bed

You got a bad attitude
I like to grind it on you
And when I let you put it on me
You better give me what I want baby

Oh my God, let me clean your wound, I can be your nurse
Got the antidote, please show me where it hurts
Can you be my father, tell me what to do
You can punish me and maybe I will punish you

Tell me what you know about sex
Sex, what do you know about sex

Oh my God, you're so hot
Hold my hair, let me get on top
Oh my God, soaking wet
Back and forth 'til we break the bed

You got a bad attitude
I like to grind it on you
And when I let you put it on me
You better give me what I want baby
Oh my
