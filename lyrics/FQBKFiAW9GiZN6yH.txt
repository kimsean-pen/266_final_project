I know I do some things
That make you so confused
One minute, I'm so in love
And the next, I can't stand you

But if you may ask
It's just the things that you do
That reminds me of all of the mess
That I've been through

I got this baggage with me
Don't wanna make you pay
For what somebody else has done to me
I don't know what to do

With all this baggage in me
Every time I hurt your feelings
It's what someones done to me
I don't mean to hurt you

Heartache and pain
I just can't do it again
So I look for the worst
And brace myself for the hurt

But nobody has ever
Treated me this way
Please be patient with me
'Coz I want you to stay

But I got all of this baggage with me
Don't wanna make you pay
For what somebody else has done to me
I don't know what to do

With all this baggage in me
Every time I hurt your feelings
It's what someone's done to me
I don't mean to hurt you

All of this baggage with me
Don't wanna make you pay
For what somebody else has done to me
I don't know what to do

With all this baggage in me
Every time I hurt your feelings
It's what someone's done to me
I don't mean to hurt you

It's no way to be livin' my life
But I can't get it out of my mind
You know I love you, yes, I do
So don't, don't, we get it confused

Don't be confused 'coz, boy
You know I really do love you
Want you to stay with me
I never meant to hurt you, baby
It won't be easy gettin' rid
Of all this baggage, all this baggage

All of this baggage with me
Don't wanna make you pay
For what somebody else has done to me
I don't know what to do

With all this baggage in me
Every time I hurt your feelings
It's what someone's done to me
I don't mean to hurt you

All of this baggage with me
Don't wanna make you pay
For what somebody else has done to me
I don't know what to do

With all this baggage in me
Every time I hurt your feelings
It's what someone's done to me
I don't mean to hurt you

All of this baggage with me
Don't wanna make you pay
For what somebody else has done to me
I don't know what to do
With all this baggage in me
