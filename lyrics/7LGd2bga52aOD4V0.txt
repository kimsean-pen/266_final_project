Come on out of your dreams
And wake up from your rÃªverie
Time is here, don't go to sleep
Streets are running on the brink
They say that we've got nothing
But a dollar for a life of sin
Cause there's trouble on the way
There's trouble on the way
Oh, get a dog and pony for a judgment day
Here we are
Running circles, around around around around
When nothing's right, just close your eyes
Close your eyes and you're gone
Dreams (dreams, dreams)
D-d-d-dreams
She's makin' me high, she's makin' me high
Dreams (dreams, dreams)
D-d-d-dreams
She's makin' me high, I wanna get me free
Nothing gonna get me in my world
Now can these broken wings free me
About a light-year from reality
If you want to fall in a dream
You could put the weight right onto me
Here we are
Running circles, around around around around
When nothing's right, just close your eyes
Close your eyes and you're gone
Dreams (dreams, dreams)
D-d-d-dreams
She's makin' me high, she's makin' me high
Dreams (dreams, dreams)
D-d-d-dreams
She's makin' me high, I wanna get me free
Nothing gonna get me in my world
Nothing gonna get me in my world
Stop [?] my dreams, dreams, yeah
Stop [?] my dreams, dreams, yeah
Dreams (dreams, dreams)
D-d-d-dreams
She's makin' me high, she's makin' me high
Dreams (dreams, dreams)
D-d-d-dreams
She's makin' me high, I wanna get me free
Nothing gonna get me in my world
