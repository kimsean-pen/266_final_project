Hold up, wait, you used to be a frenemy
Back then boy, ya didn't even notice me
Why now you tryna get a hold of me?
We never even spoke so what makes you think you know me?
It's funny how the tables turn
I'm sitting back, baby, watching you burn
No regrets, it's a lesson learned
'Cause what you think ain't my concern

About time that I let you know
My ride and I assume control
You blew it, baby, years ago
Can't get with me, now I'm grown

Hey, grown now, grown now
Don't you know that I'm grown now, grown now
Don't you know that I can hold my own, boy, you missed the boat
Can't get with me, now I'm grown, hey

Your voice dropped, you thought that you could handle me
You played me and now you tryna holla me
You're washed up and now I'm in a different league
You're trying way too hard and I don't need your flattery
Now it's funny how the tables turn
I'm sitting back, baby, watching you burn
No regrets, it's a lesson learned
'Cause what you think ain't my concern

About time that I let you know (I let you know)
My ride and I assume control (oh)
You blew it, baby, years ago
Can't get with me, now I'm grown

Hey, grown now, grown now
Don't you know that I'm grown now, grown now
Don't you know that I can hold my own, boy, you missed the boat
Can't get with me, now I'm grown, hey

You didn't want me it took too long (you didn't want me)
You didn't want me and now I'm gone (you didn't want me)
Oh, what a shame, baby, now I'm grown
Oh, yeah
Grown now, grown now
Don't you know that I'm grown now, grown now (I'm grown)
Don't you know that I can hold my own, boy, you missed the boat (whoa)
Can't get with me, now I'm grown (yeah)

Grown now, grown now
Don't you know that I'm grown now, grown now (oh)
Don't you know that I can hold my own, boy, you missed the boat
Can't get with me, now I'm grown
