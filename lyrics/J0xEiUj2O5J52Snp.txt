Do you want to ride in a big limousine?
Tell me do you want to take a little bite of the fame machine?
If you wanna be discovered and end up on the
cover of every star-studded supermarket magazine
You can do it
Stick right to it
It could happen tonight

You wanna be famous (famous)
You wanna be the one who's living the life
You wanna be famous (famous)
You wanna be the one who's taking a free ride

Do you want to cut to the front of the line?
Baby, do you need to see your name
in lights just like the Hollywood sign?
Come on, we gotta work harder
Fight the fight together
Take it to the top
We've got the winning team
It's your moment
You can own it
It's the American dream

You wanna be famous (famous)
You wanna be the one who's living the life
You wanna be famous (famous)
You wanna be the one who's taking a free ride

All day, all night the camera's on and it never lies
You're under the spotlight twenty-four seven til the end of time
Whoa, oh
You wanna be famous (famous)
Whoa, oh
You wanna be famous

You wanna be famous (famous)
You wanna be the one who's living the life
You wanna be famous (famous)
You wanna be the one who's taking a free ride
You wanna be famous

Your song is on the radio
Hot rotation video
Bright lights, fan mail
Paparazzi on your tail
Tour bus, private jet
Thinking big ain't failed you yet
Just one thing you can't forget
Takes more than just wanting it
Aim high, never rest
Put your passion to the test
Give your all, never less
Famous means that you're the best
