This day travels within the dense mist and awake this clearer sight as the birth of the night is seen... Though my mind wander like an stream beside, caressing a sigh... fading afar... closing me in, to astray. Still motionless as i am, i carry the seeds of horror inside me. This pain... grows in me and try to reach the other side... infinity of dreams... and they all - each side in me - are listening myself and my mind blacken... fading like that gone sigh... and i fall... down into the stream...
