Standin' in line marking time
Waiting for the welfare dime
'Cause they can't buy a job
The man in the silk suit hurries by
As he catches the poor old lady's eyes
Just for fun he says, 'Get a job'

That's just the way it is
Some things'll never change
That's just the way it is
Ah, but don't you believe them

Said, 'Hey little boy you can't go
Where the others go
Cause you don't look like they do'
Said, 'Hey, old man how can you stand
To think that way

Did you really think about it
Before you made the rules?'
He said, 'Son
That's just the way it is

Some things'll never change
That's just the way it is'

Ha, but don't you believe them
Ooo, yeah
Well, they passed a law in '64
To give those who ain't got, a little more
But it only goes so far

'Cause the law don't change another's mind
When all it sees at the hiring time
Is the line on the color bar
But who knows
That's just the way it is
Some things'll never change
That's just the way it is
That's just they way it is, it is
