Mostly I never knew which way was out
Once it was on, it was on and that was that
The umbilicus was a force that they'd found in rabid blood
Then I spin on my wheel like a laboratory rat
I was an electrical storm on the bathroom floor,
clutching the bowl
My blood was for the gags and other people's diseases
My monstrous little memory had swallowed me whole
It was the year I officially became the bride of Jesus

In love, in love, in love you laugh
In love you move, I move and one more time with feeling
For love, you love, I laugh, you love
Saw you in heart and the stars are splashed across the ceiling

Oh, the urge to kill somebody was basically overwhelming
I had such hard blues down there in the supermarket queues
And I had a sudden urge to become someone, someone like you
Who started out with less than anyone I ever knew

In love, in love, I love, you love, I laugh, you love
I move, you move and one more time with feeling
I love, you love, I laugh, you love
I'm sewn in heart and all the stars are splashed 'cross the ceiling

Oh, and oh, you come shining
Softly to the hold of a drink
Come as far as the edge of my blood and swim
And in the bathroom mirror I see me vomit in the sink
And all through the house we hear the hyena's hymns

Of love, I love, you love, I love, you love, I laugh, you love
I move, you move, you move, and one more time with feeling
I love, you love, I laugh, you love
We saw each other in heart and all the stars have splashed and splattered 'cross the ceiling
