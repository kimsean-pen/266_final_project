My father he told me what goes around,
Comes, comes around again
The faces you see on the way up
Are those on the way back down, my friend
But you've been climbing shoulders around you
Trying to reach the big blue sky
And all above you is just the blackness, darling
And everything below you dies
And everything below you dies

You've been growing up
You've been growing on
Further away from us now

You've been growing up
You've been growing on
Further away from us now

And nobody gives a fuck about you
Tell you it's a damn shame
The prettiest eyes in the whole world
The same fool in the same game
The same fool in the same game

You've been growing up
You've been growing on
Further away from us now

You've been growing up
You've been growing on
Further away from us now

You've been growing up
You've been growing on
Further away from us now
