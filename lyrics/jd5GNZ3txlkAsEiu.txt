It was your hair that did it
It was your hair that lit the fuse
A golden-brown halo
Like sunlight peeling through trees

I ask you for the time
But I am asking for so much more
A moth to your light bulb
You made my heart beat faster

Paralyze me with your kiss
Wipe those dirty hands on me
And maybe we're looking for the same thing
Maybe you're the one who'll complete me

Oh, how beauteous
Your lips and eyes and your fingertips
The spark of desire
On every point our bodies meet

Behind your eyes were stars
Infinite and serene
How I could suffer for you
You fascinate and magnetize me

Paralyze me with your kiss
Wipe those dirty hands on me
And maybe we're looking for the same thing
Maybe you're the one who'll complete me

Sometimes I think
I was thrown away
In this sadness
To weigh me down

Paralyze me with your kiss
Wipe those dirty hands on me
And maybe we're looking for the same thing
Maybe you're the one who'll complete me
