All embrace me
It's my time to rule at last
Fifteen years have I been waiting
To sit upon my throne

No allegiance
I will swear no oath
Crowned by God not by the church
As my power is divine

They thought I was too young to rule the land
Just as they failed to understand
Born to rule
My time has come

I was chosen by heaven
Say my name when you pray
To the skies
See Carolus rise
With the Lord my protector
Make them bow to my will
To the skies
See Carolus rise
To the skies
See Carolus rise

Proved in battle
Led my men to victory
No man alive or dead commands me
I answer to the Lord

Hear my orders
Question me and die
What I say was said in heaven
And so it shall be done

I know I was destined to rule alone
All for myself I have claimed the throne
Born to rule
My time is now

I was chosen by heaven
Say my name when you pray
To the skies
See Carolus rise
With the Lord my protector
Make them bow to my will
To the skies
See Carolus rise
To the skies
See Carolus rise

"Fram책t Karoliner
Fiendens dom 채r h채r
L책t oss krossa dom
Kasta in dom genom helvetets portar"

All that's thine shall be mine
There's no stopping me
All over Europe
My rule shall be questioned by none
All I see give to me
That is my decree
My will be done

They thought I was too young to rule the land
Just as they failed to understand
Born to rule
My time is now

(I was chosen by heaven)
I was chosen by heaven
Say my name when you pray
To the skies
See Carolus rise
To the skies...
With the Lord my protector
Make them bow to my will
To the skies
See Carolus rise
To the skies
See Carolus rise
