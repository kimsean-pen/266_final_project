Whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper
Whisper round the town
'cause you're my friend
and that's the end
for you're the only one in town
that they would beg to hang around with
You're so beautiful and calm
but with an attitude that says
hands off, you're just not good enough
Every boy and man feeling lonely
can't understand why you'd be with me
Furthermore we laugh and we draw
more attention every day so they say

Bet she's not your girlfriend
Oh no, you couldn't make her happy
Bet she's not your girlfriend
Oh no, you couldn't make her happy

Well that's as maybe in a way
but it's okay, we laugh, touch√©
while they stare in front of us
They draw away as if to say
who are these people anyway?
How dare they confront us?
Every boy and man feeling lonely
can't understand why you'd be with me
Furthermore we laugh and we draw
more attention every day so they say

Bet she's not your girlfriend
Oh no, you couldn't make her happy
Bet she's not your girlfriend
Oh no, you couldn't make her happy

Oh no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
Girlfriend, oh, oh, oh girlfriend
Girlfriend, oh, oh, oh girlfriend

I'd rather die than satisfy their curiosity
I'm kind of shy and dry and verging on ugly
They wonder what that I have got that they have not
They'll never understand that none of that matters
Every boy and man feeling lonely
can't understand why you'd be with me
Furthermore, we laugh and we draw
more attention every day so they say

Bet she's not your girlfriend
Oh, no, you couldn't make her happy
Bet she's not your girlfriend
Oh no, you couldn't make her happy
