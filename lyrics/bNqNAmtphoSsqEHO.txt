Man I opened my eyes now i'm sorry yea yea
Oh the vision i had could not compare
So maybe i stay for a while I don't know
The dream she keeps calling so i got to go

Could tap on my window, knock on my door,
The lights are on but nobody's home.
Pickin' up the pieces, where do we start,
Can't seem to do much with this broken heart
Cleanin' the house man

Well thats all i'm tryin to do,
Get up from the bottom,
It's taken some time to get through
How am i gonna leave you
How am i gonna leave you

Man I opened my eyes now i'm sorry yea yea
Oh the vision i had could not compare
So maybe i stay for a while I don't know
The dream she keeps calling so i got to go

It all gets cold, reality hits,
I think i'm gonna stay on these shores for a bit,
To catch the last rays, walk in the sun,
So i don't feel like its over,
before before
