How carelessly the bound daylight caresses
Oblivious to wandering eyes extinguished
Free me reckless with the night
Elusive scenes enkindled burst to fire
Where splendor casts umbrageous twin
And love sparks radiance
To guide the heart from within
All in search for you
Eve of brilliance
Till the morning proves indifference
For the sparks die
Leaving shadows in my vision
How dutifully the dull sunlight chastises
Adopted wings that dare arise with promise
Incandescent I represent
Pandora's uninformed enlightenment
And fears that creep about my flame
Evanesce until the dawn calls them
Home again bearing thoughts of you
And I'm helpless to see
Unbecoming of me
Blindly mythicizing
Etiolation emphasized by merrythoughts
Once broken by moonlight
Oh brighter to have never loved
Than gather ghosts of the blinding
Relentless sun idealized in you
And I can't bear to see
Unbecoming of me
Love is not dead
