For your birthday she sent you a card
She didn't sign her name she gave an autograph
Now she's trying to call your bluff
She your true love?

We knew the boy who went from Mod to Ted
She asked matter of fact had he gone off his head
He was uncomplaining as a tree
Not a thing like me

You're not a teenager
So don't act like one
Sure she is a heartbreaker
Does she have one?
Is it down to me, down to me?
We both rarely speak

I went for a stroll after dark
I thought of you and her while staring at the black
I didn't have you down for being easily led
Or the girl well read

You're not a teenager
So don't act like one
Sure she is a heartbreaker
Does she have one?
Is it down to me, down to me?
We both rarely speak
