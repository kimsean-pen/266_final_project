To those who hate
Have cried for noone
You can call
You can call

To those who talk
And wish against me
You can call
You can call

Late in the evening when it gets dark
You can call

To those who say
They go unbeaten
You can fall
You can fall

To those who say
It's because they're weak
You can fall
You can fall

Late in the evening when it gets dark
You can fall
