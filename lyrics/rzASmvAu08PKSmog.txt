Hey girls, have you
Ever thought about
About all of those little doubts
That keep comin' up
In a boy's mind
When you just smile
'Cause baby, how should
He know what you really feel
If that look was fake or real
Or if he's the fifth or sixth guy
To whom you smile
Baby, think 'bout the way
That you treat a boy
'Cause you shouldn't treat him like a toy
If you would like
Him spend the night
Then baby, go and tell him right
Boys
'Cause now I'm talking about
Boys
'Cause you don't know about
Boys
With your love we are happy
Boys
Oh, I like being one of them
Boys
'Cause now I'm talking about
Boys
Oh, the hyped up and psyched up
Boys
Always thinking about lovely
Boys
And now I'm thinking
That the time is right
For a hot night
To make you hold me tight
And make you feel right
And if there's something
That you want that I got
You can have it all night,
Non-stop
I wanna treat you right
And take you higher and higher
I wanna hold you tight
And make you hot like fire
I wanna stay all night,
I wanna quench your desire
Something I forgot?
I think not
But girl now, hey,
How should I know
What you'd say?
If I'd ask you to play
For a night and a day
Would you say, hey babe,
I'd like you to stay
Or would you say,
No, no, no, no way
Girls, if you want us to stay,
You gotta say so
And if you want us to leave,
You gotta say no
Now, is it a friendship or
The real deal?
Girls tell us what you want,
What you need,
What you feel
Boys
'Cause now I'm talking about
Boys
'Cause you don't know about
Boys
with your love we are happy
Boys
oh, I like being one of them
Boys
'Cause now I'm talking about
Boys
Oh, the hyped up and psyched up
Boys
Always thinking about lovely
Boys
Hey girls, if you like a boy,
Then you know
That's all right to make a show
You can play little hard to get
Just to make him sweat
But baby, if you keep him
Waiting too long
Then one day,
He might be gone
So just tell him what is right
And what you like
Baby, think about the way
That you treat a boy
Cause you shouldn't treat him like a toy
If you'd really like him
To spend the night
Then baby,
Go and tell him right
Boys
'Cause now I'm talking about
Boys
' Cause you don't know about
Boys
With your love we are happy
Boys
Oh, I like being one of them
