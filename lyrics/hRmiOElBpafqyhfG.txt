Everyday theres a thousand things
that somehow pass us by
Gana cut through the noise
So you can know what love sounds like
I'm comin' to your frequency
To 106 point me
So there's no
Distractions

Take a breath
Take it in
Love has no expiration date
My heart will always beat for you
At a constant rate
It will outlast everything
You think is set is stone
It goes on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on...

Buzzing like
Neon Lights
Can you feel my love?
Loud and clear
Pulls you near
Can you feel my love

We got all the memories
So much more we can see
Better than our first kiss
Snow falling at Christmas
Like sleeping in on Sunday
Laughter we never faked
Bob Marley in Summer
One love for each other

Oh it feels like...

Fireflies
Day and night
Can you feel my love?

Everyone is looking for a special connection
But its like your compass points
A million directions
Do you need me to buy you
A telescope so you can see
How good
This could be

Buzzing like
Neon Lights
Can you feel my love?
Loud and clear

Pulls you near
Can you feel me love?

Oh!

We got all the memories
So much more we can see
Better than our first kiss
Snow falling at Christmas
Like sleeping in on Sunday
Laughter we never faked
Bob Marley in Summer
One love for each other

Oh it feels like...

Fireflies
Day and night
Can you feel my love?
(Can you feel it?)

And I'll wait for you
As long as it takes
Until I get through
And it hits you right in the face

Can you feel my lo-o-ove?
Can you feel my love?

We got all the memories
So much more we can see
Better than our first kiss
Snow falling at Christmas
Like sleeping in on Sunday
Laughter we never faked
Bob Marley in Summer
One love for each other
Oh it feels like...
(One love for each other...)
Buzzing like
Neon Lights
Can you feel my love?
Fireflies
Day and night
Can you feel my love?
