Something you fear has just come to town
Its taking over the kids and its making them crazy
I'm staying at home and not joining in
So stay by my side and watch me

One circle one square one embrace
One look one line on your face
One hair on your heads outta place
so you might as well give up the race

Down in the streets the light bulbs explode
Climb out the window and tell them you're leaving
Empty your pockets and hold out your hands
Pretend that you love me
