Is that the old man walking in the dark

Take me home where them broken brights
Are shinning down, make me feel alright
When we were young
When we were young

Is that the old man walking in the dark
Is that the old man walking in the dark

Shake them bones let me lost tonight
We'll grow young make me feel alright
When we were young
When we were young

Is that the old man walking in the dark
