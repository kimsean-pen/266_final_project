She uses her body
To say the things that she can't say
But I don't know why, I can't lie
I could never really move that way

So listen, I go crazy
The way she makes me
Be on my knees
Yeah!
I beg it, please
Yeah!

What he said
What she said
It doesn't really matter in the end
I can see it goin' fast
Talkin' cheap will never last

I notice you noticing me
The way that you walk in
That I believe
Everythin' you said
Your body won't lie in bed

So listen, I go crazy
The way she makes me
Now listen, I go crazy
The way she makes me
Be on the floor
Yeah!
I want some more
Yeah!

She is in the back seat
Buyin' everythin' he says
While he's runnin' like a bull
That you look in the mirror, air [?]

You can turn around...
