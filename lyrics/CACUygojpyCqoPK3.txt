You've been on my mind
And I wonder if you will ever be mine
I like that
You've been on my mind
And I wonder if you will ever be mine
I like that

When you walk in the room stops talking
The boys are flocking
They want you
Keep my distance
'Cause you're with him
Make a decision
Is he your lover or boyfriend?

Party's over
Wishing on a four-leaf clover you'll come over
When we're over this
Party's over
Wishing on a four-leaf clover you'll come over
When we're over this

We could be friends
We could be more than friends if you want to

I don't know them
They're not my friends
I'll just have them come over so I have a reason, to see you
You are a superstar
Seen every movie that you've been in
Let's make a movie tonight

Party's over
Wishing on a four-leaf clover you'll come over
When we're over this
Party's over
Wishing on a four-leaf clover you'll come over
When we're over this

I don't wanna live without you
Couldn't see my life without you in it
I'd probably lose my fucking mind
I don't wanna live without you
Couldn't see my life without you in it
I'd probably lose my fucking mind
