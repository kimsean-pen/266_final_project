Why are you so far from me?
In my arms is where you ought to be.

How long will you make me wait?

I don't know how much more I can take.

I missed you
But I haven't met you

Oh but I want to

How I do

Slowly counting down the days

'til I finally know your name
Oooh, the way your hand feels round my waist

the way you laugh
the way your kisses taste
I missed you
But I haven't met you
Oh but I want to
How I do
How I do...
I've missed you
But I haven't met you
Oh I missed you
But I haven't met you
Oh but I want to
Oh how I want to
Dear, whoever you might be
I'm still waiting patiently.
