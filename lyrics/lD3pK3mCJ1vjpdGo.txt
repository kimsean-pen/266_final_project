Sweetheart, what have you done to us?
I turned my back and you turned to dust
What have you done?

And oh please, just come here, don't fight with me
And I admit, think you may have broken it, yeah I admit

And if all you wanted was songs for you
Well here goes, after all that you've put me through
Here's one for you

And don't call me lover, it's not enough
It's got to be tough, cynical stuff
Follow my words to the end of our love

And God, you were the one who told me not to be
So English

Sweetheart, what have you done to our love?
