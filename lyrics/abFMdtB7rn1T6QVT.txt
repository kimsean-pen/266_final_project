So tired, tired of this drama
You go your way, I go my way
No more, no more
I need to be free
I'm so tired, tired, tired, tired

Broken heart again
Another lesson learned
Better know your friends
Or else you will get burned
Gotta count on me
'Cause I can guarantee
That I'll be fine

(No more, pain), no more pain
(No more pain), no more pain
(No drama), no more drama in my life
No one's gonna make me hurt again

Why'd I play the fool
Go through ups and downs
Knowing all the time
You wouldn't be around
But maybe I liked the stress
'Cause I was young and restless
But that was long ago
I don't wanna cry no more

(No more, pain), no more pain
(No more game), no more game messin with my mind
(No drama), no more drama in my life
No one's gonna make me hurt again
(No more tears) no more tears, I'm tired of cryin every night
(No more fears) no more fears, I really don't wanna cry
(No drama) no more in my life
I don't ever wanna hurt again
Wanna speak my mind, wanna speak my mind

Uh, it feel so good
When you let go
Of all the drama in your life
Now you're free from all the pain
Free from all the game
Free from all the stress
To find your happiness
I don't know
Only God knows where the story ends for me
But I know where the story begins
It's up to us to choose
Whether we win or loose
And I choose to win

(No more pain), no more pain
(No more game), tired of your playin' game with my mind
(No drama), no more drama in my life
No more, no more, no more, no more
(No more tears) no more tears, no more cryin' every night
(No more fears) no more waking be up in the morning
With your disturbing phone calls, leave me alone, go ahead
(No drama) no more in my life

(No more pain), no more
(No more game), no more game, I'm tired, I'm so tired
(No drama), no more, no more...

No more drama, no more drama
No more drama, no more drama
No more drama
No more drama
No more drama
No more drama
No more drama
No more drama, in my, in my, in my life
So tired, so tired, tired of all this drama
