Let's go!

So down and digging, I lost myself
But it's the last time I bloody my hands
I'm living in vain
I never promised you a damn thing that I can't promise myself
And here we go! Tick-tock-tick-tock-tick...

In the eye of the storm I make my stand
But I'm not waiting for the walls to close in
I just brace myself for winds to change their ways
In the eye of the storm I'm making my stand

With a broke down spirit you're crawlin' in the middle
Don't you point your finger in my face
Cuz every bad decision that you made you're livin' with
And everyone else is to blame
And here we go! Tick-tock-tick-tock-tick...

In the eye of the storm I make my stand
But I'm not waiting for the walls to close in
I just brace myself for winds to change their ways
In the eye of the storm I'm making my stand, go!

In the eye of the storm I make my stand
But I'm not waiting for the walls to close in
I just brace myself for winds to change their ways
In the eye of the storm I make my stand
In the eye of the storm I'm taking my stand
In the eye of the storm I make my stand, let's go!
