Her heart shivers in my hand
She's melting on me like cotton candy
I make the faces that make you cry
I want you more when you're afraid of
My disease, disease is draining me
Anymore you're not so pretty please
Disease, disease is draining me
I want you more when you're afraid of me
I will break your inside out
You are mine, you are mine
I will break you inside out
you are mine, you are mine
Her hair hangs in swollen strings
I'm choking on her, it feels so sickening
I make the faces that make you cry
I want you more when you're afraid of
My disease, disease is draining me
Anymore you're not so pretty please
Disease, disease is draining me
I want you more when you're afraid of me
I will break you inside out
You are mine, you are mine
