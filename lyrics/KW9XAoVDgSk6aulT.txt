Well, let me tell you
Well, no chick made could be the same as sweet Georgia Brown
Crazy feet that dance so neat as sweet Georgia Brown
I tell you just why, you know I don't lie
It's been said she knocks 'em dead in any old town
Since she came right it's a shame how she brings 'em down
In Liverpool she even dared to criticize the Beatles' hair
With their whole fan club standin there, I mean sweet Georgia Brown
I say this group is absolutely marvelous with the piano
Don't you think os?
Not too commercial, boys, not too commercial!
When it comes to music, sweet Georgia is known to mind
Don't buy clothes at fashion shows but she still looks fine
Snap chicks cry, they want to die when Georgie does the twist
I never would try to tell you just why, use your imagination
There's a DJ crazy for her living in our hometown
Since she came it's a shame she turns him down
Records that she can get are records they ain't sent him yet
Carolina may have Dina but that don't have Georgia Brown
Oh, that sweet Georgia
Yeah yeah yeah, I mean Brown
Oh oh oh, sweet Georgia Brown
