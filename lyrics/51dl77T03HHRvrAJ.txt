Way down here
You need a reason to move
Feel like a fool
Running your stateside games
Lose your load
Leave your mind behind, Baby James

Oh, Mexico
It sounds so simple I just got to go
The sun's so hot I forgot to go home
Guess I'll have to go now

Americano got the sleepy damn eye
But his body's still shaking like a live wire
Sleepy "Se√±orita" with the eyes on fire

Oh, Mexico
It sounds so sweet with the sun sinking low
Moon's so bright like to light up the night
Make everything all right

Baby's hungry and the money's all gone
The folks back home don't want to talk on the phone
She gets a long letter, sends back a postcard
Times are hard

Oh, down in Mexico
I never really been so I don't really know
Oh, Mexico
I guess I'll have to go

Oh, Mexico
I never really been but I'd sure like to go
Oh, Mexico
I guess I'll have to go now

Talkin' down in Mexico (Mexico)
In a honky tonk down in Mexico
Oh, Mexico, Mexico
Oh, Mexico, Mexico
Oh, Mexico, Mexico
Oh, Mexico, Mexico
Oh, Mexico, Mexico
Oh, Mexico, Mexico
Oh, Mexico, Mexico
