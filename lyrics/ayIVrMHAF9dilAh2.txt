Please return to us, restart the fire inside
I remember clear as day, when the spark left your eyes

Do you feel alive? Our life to prove, one chance defined
Side by side, we walked, no fear of time

Find strength, our roads collide
Find strength, our roads collide

Do you feel alive?
Our life to prove, one chance defined
Side by side
We walked, no fear

Take hold, it's flowing through your senses
Can you feel it, the rush it gives?
Let go, discover what you're here for
We feel it, adrenaline

Run
Let the blood flow, make the veins show
And hold
Onto your nerve, in their face you'll need the right words
Let the blood flow
Let the blood flow
This will make your heart stop

This is where your heart stops

Take hold, it's flowing through your senses
Can you feel it, the rush it gives?
Let go, discover what you're here for
We feel it, adrenaline

Please return to us, restart the fire inside
I remember clear as day, when the spark left your eyes

Do you feel alive?
Our life to prove, one chance defined
Side by side
We walked, no fear of time

This is where your heart stops
