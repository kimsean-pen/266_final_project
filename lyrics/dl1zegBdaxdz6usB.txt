Crazy. . .Babies. . .
Crazy babies never say die
Born to live on a permanent high,
Flying high above the world below,
They'd better come down soon
Or everyone will know
YEAH!

Nobody's gonna change them, change them,
They've gone over the top
Nobody's gonna tame them, tame them,
They're never gonna stop

Walk that walk, ooooo
Talk that talk, ooooo
Walk that walk, ooooo
Talk that talk, ooooo

Crazy. . . Babies. . .
When they were born
They were born to be wild
Some say I'm another Devil's child
Crazy babies in a world of their own,
I am a crazy babe,
So you'd better leave me alone tonight

Nobody's gonna change me, change me
I'm gonna do this 'til I die,
Nobody's gonna tame me, tame me,
So you better not try

Walk that walk, ooooo
Talk that talk, ooooo
Walk that walk, ooooo
Talk that talk, ooooo

Crazy. . . Babies. . .
No use talking 'bout if they'll last,
Where they're goin'
Or about their past
They're just the result of our society,
So frustrated
Just like you and me

Nobody's gonna change them, change them,
They've gone over the top
Nobody's gonna tame them, tame them,
They're never gonna stop

Walk that walk,
Talk that talk,
Walk that walk,
Talk that talk
