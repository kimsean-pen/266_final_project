Gather around,
All the things that we admire.
To be here is where I wanted to be,
To abandon who I was.

Gather around,
As we're pushed towards the fire.
We've been tricked into believing that all
Starts and ends within our walls.

Gather around,
Holding close your sons and daughters.
Promise them that we will all be alright
Let them know you love them all.

Talk to yourself,
Let your essence be the answer,
While we chase the meaning of who we are,
Navigating through a storm.

Gather around and follow me,
Something misled us to this.
Wanting it all is poverty,
Rich is the one who is free.

Be the one who wakes up,
All of those who roam.

Shake your head to the sides, wake the animal inside of you.
Run away from it all let the wildness be your home.
Plant a tree, kill a man, let your instincts be in charge of you.
Where you walk, what you dream, measures who you really are.

Turn to your friends,
Let them face the one you mirror.
And the demons that now rest on your side,
They will leave you on your own.
