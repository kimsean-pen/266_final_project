You were writhing on the floor like a moth in molasses
Who ever taught you to move your body like that?
Goose pimpled, yelled Spanish like some out of date acid
Who ever taught you to scream like that?

Maybe someday I could move like you
(Maybe someday I could move like you)
But I'm not looking for a holy ghost
Maybe someday I can scream like you
(Maybe someday I can scream like you)
But I'm not looking for a holy ghost

You were crying on the shoulders of the men in the shadows
Who ever taught you to sell your sex like that?
I'm thinking two halos in a stained glass window
"Jesus, strangers are as strange as that?"

Maybe someday I could move like you
(Maybe someday I could move like you)
But I'm not looking for a holy ghost
Maybe someday I can scream like you
(Maybe someday I can scream like you)
But I'm not looking for a holy ghost
Maybe someday I could move like you
(Maybe someday I could move like you)
But I'm not looking for a holy ghost
Maybe someday I can scream like you
(Maybe someday I can scream like you)
But I'm not looking for a holy ghost
