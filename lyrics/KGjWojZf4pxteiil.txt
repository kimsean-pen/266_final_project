Your love
Your love is always lasting
Babe, I wanna be with you
You know that I wanna be true

'Cause tonight, tonight, tonight is the night
You know, you know, I wanna make it right
I'll always remember that night
You were so outta sight

We hold each other, ooh, so tight
We hold each other all through the night
Babe, you are the only one
And I wanna be with you

'Cause I know, you know the time is right
You touch me baby when you hold me tight
Let's keep making on all through
Baby, never, never let me go
For as long as I live
Touch me hard and I'm ready to give
Your love

Your love
Your love is always lasting
The day that I'll be without you
And that you will make me blue

I know, I know, I know it isn't right
'Cause tonight, tonight, tonight is the night
Oh, baby, it feels so good
I know, I'm understood
I love you, I'll hold you tight
Hold me, baby, 'til the morning light
Your love
Your love is never changing
(Your love is never changing)
Your love
Your love is always lasting
(Your love is alwyas lasting)
