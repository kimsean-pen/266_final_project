He don't walk along with anybody
He's just walking with himself
And she don't stop to talk to anybody
She's just talking to her own self

And you don't right or wrong for anybody
You just put it on your shelf
'Cause I don't get along with anybody
I just get on by myself, myself

We are so far in time
To be all apart

I could talk a lot of hot talk at a pot luck with my peers
But the walls at home make up the right tone
Quiet tendency

A little ant hill go down the landfill
It's a symbol of the age
Where the dying art be the sum of the parts
And apart is where we stay
I say

We are so far in time
To be all apart, to be all untied
From each other

Oh yeah, we are so far in time

He be living by himself
She's alone up in her head
And they alive or are they dead
Just by themselves

All by them selves

I don't walk along with anybody
And I don't stop to talk to anybody
And I don't right or wrong for anybody
Not for anybody, not for anybody, not for anybody
But myself

We are
We are
We are
We are

We are so far in time
To be all apart, to be all untied
From each other, each other

Oh yeah, we are so far in time
Far in time
