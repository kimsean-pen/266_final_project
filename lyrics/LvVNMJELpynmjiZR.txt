Is threaten me
'Cause i don't know who really . different that you probably
Is threaten me
'Cause i don't know who really . different that you probably
Is threaten me
'Cause i don't know who really . different that you probably
That you problem me
But it's blue . that i'm free to go go
Places you couldn't stay alone
Your energy in song
There's a road to love
A .'cause
There's a rod to love
And love cost
And love cost
There's a road to love
And love cost
'Cause i don't know who really ...
I'm alone because, i'm alone because
I don't know who really . your problems .
I'm alone because
The road to love
Alone because
Alone because
A road to love
Alone because
Alone because
There's a road to love
