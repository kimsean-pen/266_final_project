Girl you're so demanding
Try to keep you satisfied
You roll your eyes and look so tired

Baby it's not easy
Doin' my best but always fail
Need some new air, got too stale

And maybe it's not over
? now I can see a way
Hanging on from day to day

I feel like I can't take it
I'm fresh out of ideas right now
If there's someway then show me how

[Interlude]

Girl you're so demanding
Nothing that I say or do
Can ever get a smile from you

Act like you're so busy
Feel bad for the time I take
You leave me trailing in you're wake

I think I'm going crazy
It's like I'm on a different page
But you're the one whose acting strange

So baby whats the answer?
Right now I got no idea
Wish I could just disappear
[just disappear]
[just disappear]
