Other lives, always tempted to trade
Will they hate me for all the choices I made?

Will they stop when they see me again?
I can't stop now I know who I am

Now I'm all yours, I'm not afraid
and you're all mine, say what they may
and all your love I take to the grave
and all my life starts now

Tear me down, they can't take you out of my thoughts
Under every scar there's a battle I've lost

Will they stop when they see us again?
I can't stop now I know who I am

Now I'm all yours, I'm not afraid
and you're all mine, say what they may
and all your love I take to the grave
and all my life starts

I'm all yours, I'm not afraid
and you're all mine, say what they may
and all your love I take to the grave
and all my life starts, starts now
