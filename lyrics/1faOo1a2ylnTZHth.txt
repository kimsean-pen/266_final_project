I was just a boy
Couldn't afford most of the toys
So we just hanged out in the streets
'girl, I don't dance, I just do the beats.'

Industrial neighborhood
I lived my life the way I could
My house was all painted in green
I can't forget most of the scenes

Because I'm getting old!
I'm not a kid anymore
I'm getting old
I'm not a kid anymore

I was born in the 80's
That's why I sing this song
My memories are faded
But they aren't gone

Well I was born in the 80's
And I miss them too
I don't get totally crazy
Only because of you

I had a bike
I had a dog, his name was spike
We used to play ball all night long
We used to play hair metal songs

I bought a guitar
My tunes have taken me so far
I can't remember most of the nights
'cause of the vodka, lime and ice
