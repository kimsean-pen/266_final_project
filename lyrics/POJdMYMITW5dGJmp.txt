Mild rays of the sun will burn your eyes
After dwelling in darkness for the rest of your life
Mild rays of the sun will burn your eyes
After dwelling in darkness
Walking out of this cave
This forlorn place that I used to call mine
Now daylight burns my eyes
The earth is shaking
Times are changing
The Clock is ticking
Even down here we won't be secure
The ceiling crumbles
Over my warped head
Giving way to broad daylight
Am I already dead?
Mild rays of the sun will burn your eyes
After dwelling in darkness
In this cave that I used to call mine
Searching for shelter
Right after the raid
Cover up your eyes: the most human trait
Don't want any change
I prefer to stall
Why can't we appreciate the gift of free fall
Freedom is what scares us most of all
We duck for cover in our shelters and caves
Freedom is what scares us most of all
And our horizon is never more than 2 steps away
I'm about to faint
So much to see
So much to hear
So much to dare
So much to share
So much to feel
So much to steal
So much to taste
No time to waste
My tongue is burning
My eyes are watering
My mind is turning
I'm overloaded
My limbs are aching
My ears are bleeding
System's collapsing
I'm about to faint
So much to do
So much to try
So much to lose
Before we die
So much to feel
So much to steal
So much to taste
No time to waste
My tongue is burning
My eyes are watering
System's collapsing
I'm about to faint
So much to feel
So much to steal
So much to taste
No time to waste
I'm about to FAINT!
So much to feel
So much to steal
So much to taste
No time to...
