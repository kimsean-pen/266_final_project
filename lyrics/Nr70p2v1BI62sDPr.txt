Don't you know I'm not insane I have foreseen the Judgement Day
Machines will annihilate
Lock me up or throw me to the wolves the truth remains unchanged
Machines have given the date

Extermination has begun
The Sentinel is on the run
To warn the Armageddon Clan
Before we're all gonna die

I'm running for my life
I'm running out of time
Oh they will never get me alive
We're all gonna die
I'm running for my life
I'm running out of time
Oh they will never get me alive

As the words of warning echoed on the world did not respond
Machines came down from the sky
Human corpses headless torsos hang impaled and burn to dust
Machines slayed many of us

Extermination has begun
The Sentinel is on the run
To warn the Armageddon Clan
Before we're all gonna die

I'm running for my life
I'm running out of time
Oh they will never get me alive
We're all gonna die
I'm running for my life
I'm running out of time
Oh they will never get me alive

A computer-generated world experiments on slaves
Machines will give them no rest
I will not forsake this land and fly a million miles away
Machines keep feeding the flame

And when the bell will toll no more
We can't return we can't go on
We are the Armageddon Clan
Tonight we're all gonna die

I'm running for my life
I'm running out of time
Oh they will never get me alive
We're all gonna die
I'm running for my life
I'm running out of time
Oh they will never, they will never, they will never get me alive

Ooh, they will never get me alive!
