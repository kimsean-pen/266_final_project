Sitting up on our crane, it always feels the same
When we're up high 'cause I feel like I'm falling down
And I can't say goodbye to my friends
'Cause they're having a real good time
Get up on our plane, it always feels the same
When we're up high 'cause I feel like we're crashing down
And I can't say goodbye to my love
She's been sleeping the whole flight

And you know it's gonna get you feeling like you're going down
Just try to tell yourself, you know it's coming up as you're speeding towards the ground

Sitting up on our crane, it always feels the same
When we're up high 'cause I feel like I'm falling down
And I can't say goodbye to my friends
'Cause they're having a real good time

And you know it's gonna get you feeling like you're going down
Just try to tell yourself, you know it's coming up as your speeding towards the ground
Oh, it's gonna get you feeling like you're going down
Just try to tell yourself, you know it's coming up as you're speeding towards the ground

All I wanna do is getting drunk, listen (?)
'Cause he's the man, oh yeah-yeah-yeah, 'cause he's the man, yeah-yeah
