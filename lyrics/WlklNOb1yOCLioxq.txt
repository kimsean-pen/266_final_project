Lalalaladada

Lalalaladada
Lalalaladadada
Lalalaladada (Oh-oh)

We're a thousand miles from comfort
We have traveled land and sea
But as long as you are with me
There's no place I'd rather be

I would wait forever
Exalted in the scene
As long as I am with you
My heart continues to beat

With every step we take
Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so casually

We're different and the same
Gave you another name
Switch up the batteries

If you gave me a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be

No-no-no-no-no, no place I'd rather be
No-no-no-no-no, no place I'd rather be
No-no-no-no-no, no place I'd rather be

Lalalaladada (Oh)
Lalalalala

We staked out on a mission
To find our inner peace
Oh, make it everlasting
So nothing's incomplete

With every step we take
Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so casually

We're different and the same
Gave you another name
Switch up the batteries, oh

If you gave me a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be

No-no-no-no-no, no place I'd rather be
No-no-no-no-no, no place I'd rather be
No-no-no-no-no, no place I'd rather be
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be

Lalalaladada
Lalalaladadada (Be)
Lalalaladada
Lalalaladadada (No-o)
Lalalaladada
Lalalaladadada (Be, be, be, be)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

If you gave me a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be

No-no-no-no-no, no place I'd rather be
No-no-no-no-no, no place I'd rather be
No-no-no-no-no, no place I'd rather be
When I am with you there's no place I'd rather be
