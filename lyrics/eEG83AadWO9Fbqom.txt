Baptised in fire, forty to one!

So silent before the storm
Awaiting command
A few has been chosen to stand
As one outnumbered by far

The orders from high command
"Fight back, hold your ground!"
In early September it came
A war unknown to the world

No army may enter that land
That is protected by Polish hand
Unless you are forty to one
Your force will soon be undone

Undone!
Baptised in fire
Forty to one
Spirit of spartans

Death and glory
Soldiers of Poland
Second to none
Wrath of the Wehrmacht brought to a halt

The eigthth of September starts
The rage of the Reich
A barrage of mortars and guns
Stand fast, the bunkers will hold

The captain has pledged his life
I'll face my fate here!
The sound of artillery strike
So fierce, the thunder of guns!
So come, bring on all that you've got
Come hell, come high water, never stop

Unless you are forty to one
Your lives will soon be undone
Undone!

Baptised in fire, forty to one!
Spirit of spartans
Death and glory
Soldiers of Poland
Second to none

Wrath of the Wehrmacht brought to a halt
Always remember, a fallen soldier
Always remember, fathers and sons at war
Always remember, a fallen soldier
Always remember, fathers and sons at war
Always remember, a fallen soldier
Always remember, buried in history

No vermin may enter that land
That is protected by Polish hand
Unless you are forty to one
Your force will soon be undone
Undone!

Baptised in fire
Forty to one
Spirit of spartans
Death and glory!
Soldiers of Poland
Second to none
Wrath of the Wehrmacht brought to a halt
No, no, no
