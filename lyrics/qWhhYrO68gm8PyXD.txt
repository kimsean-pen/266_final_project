Darlin'
my frustration
it gets me, it gets me where it hurts me most
like five rapid to the gut
it's not so easy to see
and I've been gone far, far too long
to expect you not to change even a little bit

and I guess I hope I'm still the kind of guy
you're needing for your fool
'Cause life's a ball here on the road and these four wheels

oh, but something about the whole thing
it doesnt feel real
work my days for you
'Cause love you girl, I don't want you

I need you
and I can't see no other way
darlin'
I work my days for you
'Cause I love you girl, I don't want you

I need you
and I can't see no other way
oh, this separation
it really gets you thinking
and all those used up cliches
well they've worn enough in the wind

and I, I wonder if you're half as innocent as you assured me
or if you thank him for his time and just never call again
oh oh
and after all the lights and shows and long hope lanes

it'd be you and me again
but until then
I work my days for you
'Cause I love you girl, I don't want you

I need you
I can't see no other way
oh darlin'
I work my days for you
'Cause I love you girl, I don't want you

I need you
and I can't see no other way
oh live
I'm home
so love me

and I'm home babe
oh so touch me
yeah
I'm home
so kiss me, like you do
cause you bet

baby
that I'll do it to you
oh babe,
yeah baby
I want you babe
I'm, I'm home babe
so take me in your arms
oh babe, baby
love me like you do
oh kiss me like you do
and baby you bet I'll do it to you
oh no
hold me like you do
