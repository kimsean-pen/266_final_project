Crave communication
See me this is my life
In the crazy robot man reservation

Do you feel him
The cold vibration?
Comes from everywhere
Produce a crazy science fiction creation

And I say
O-o-oh, I'm a robot man
And I say
O-o-oh, I'm a loser
I say
O-o-oh, I'm a robot man
Well, that's my mind
That's my life
That's my soul

Babe, it's a magic station
Where we live what we do
With our magic from my generation

I say, babe
It's not a vision
It's reality, this is a robot scene
What we live in

And I say
O-o-oh, I'm a robot man
And I say
O-o-oh, I'm a loser
I say
O-o-oh, I'm a robot man
Well, that's my mind
That's my life
That's my soul

And I say
O-o-oh, I'm a robot man
And I say
O-o-oh, I'm a loser
I say
O-o-oh, I'm a robot man
And I say
O-o-oh, I'm a robot man
And I say
O-o-oh, I'm a loser
I say
O-o-oh, I'm a robot man
