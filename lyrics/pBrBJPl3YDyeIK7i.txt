Floozies at the rainbow
Superstars that won't get far
Who is who that we know
Coochie coo is at the bar

Do you really love
Do you love do you love
Do you wanna make the call
We all long
We all fall

Shoelace for the sirenes
Groupies and the tyrant's ply

Do your really want
Do you want do you want
Do you want to have it all
We all long
We all fall

I'm so tired
Well I get by but I could use a few
I'm so tired that I slept along the way

A suitcase of perception
Rhinestones and redemption cries
Do you really love
Do you love do you love
Do you wanna make the call
We all long
We all fall

I'm so tired
The sun beats down upon my lonely face
I'm so tired that I slept along the way

Do you really love
Do you love do you chase
Do you take this town today
We all long
We all face

I'm so tired
Well I get by but I could use a few
And I'm so tired that I slept along the way

The sun beats down upon my lonely face and
A perfect world with all it's perfect places

I could use a few for just in cases
And I'm so tired that I slept along the way.
