When I get home, man, we can do it again.

I hear them calling out to you,
But it gets easier, not harder, when they do.
I see it makes you happy, and I hate it to be true,
But I know that I won't make it anywhere following you.
Just say you'll be there...

When I get home, man, we can do it again.

I see your face in all my dreams,
But I guess I never understood exactly what it means.
I wake up feeling sorry, never know what for,
Moping up the stairs and slowly walking out the door on my own.

When I get home...
What if I just do not let you in,
Because I know that you won't stay.
When I get home...
Maybe I'd prefer to be alone,
I know better than to say we can do it again.
