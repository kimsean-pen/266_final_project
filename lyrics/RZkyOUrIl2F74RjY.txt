Is this what we want?
Or is it all we know?
We keep breaking variation
It kills the point of human soul

We build it all
Just to watch it fall
We build barricades
There's so much hate
Humanity equals misery
There's nothing here to see

Is this what we want?
Or is it all we know?
And I don't have trust in society
When it won't trust me

We're players
Of this cruel game
I'm losing willingly
It's up to me
My only chance to be is to leave
I own my reality

Is this what we want?
Or is it all we know?
We keep breaking variation
It kills the point of human soul
