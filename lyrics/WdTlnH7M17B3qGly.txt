Now that I've worn out, I've worn out the world
I'm on my knees in fascination looking through the night
And the moon's never seen me before
But I'm reflecting light

I rode the pain down, got off and looked up
Looked into your eyes
The last open windows all around
My dark heart lit up the skies

And now that I've worn out, I've worn out the world
I'm on my knees in fascination looking through the night
And the moon's never seen me before
But I'm reflecting light

Give up the ground under your feet
Hold on to nothing for good
Turn and run at the mean dogs chasing you
Stand-alone and misunderstood

And now that I've worn out, I've worn out the world
I'm on my knees in fascination looking through the night
And the moon's never seen me before
But I'm reflecting light
