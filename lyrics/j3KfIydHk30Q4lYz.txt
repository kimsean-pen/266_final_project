see this life through the eyes of others
And on, on this night
I will bide my time

And move with these eyes, live a life untouched by time
I'll be waiting in the wings
I'll be here when you arrive

On your final days, they will come
Like a child you'll walk into the unknown
On your final days, when they come
Like a child you'll walk into the unknown

When you cross the line
Live a life untouched by time
On this rock its only just a glitch
And this state is only just a blink

I see this life through the eyes of others
