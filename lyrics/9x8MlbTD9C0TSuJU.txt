So drunk

Hey
Move out, it's time for someone else
Quit thinking only of yourself
You're really a nasty piece of work
You know, you thought you was a hero but you're really just a jerk

On my way
You know I won't pay your price

You can't stop me, don'tcha even try
Gonna stick my finger in your eye
You don't deserve my admiration
And I'll sling you out the window if you give me aggravation

On my way
You know I won't pay your price

Listen, I'm tired of listening to crap
I'd rather stab you in the back
I'm telling you the only real reason
That you ain't gonna get it is 'cause skunk is outta season

On my way
You know I won't pay your price

Shut the door behind you when you go
Why you're still here, I really don't know
I'm gonna count up to three
And if you're still here, I'll get a gun and blow away your knees

On my way
You know I won't pay your price
Your price, yeah
Your price
You know, your price

Oh, no
Oh, no no
