Don't stand in the darkness
Thinking light luck(?)
Keep the soul loose

Cristals on the skyline
Cut the midnight
Alterable lift

You're the one that can make me stay
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
You're the one that's been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my eye
You're the one that can turn the ṗage
You're the one that gave me light in another gage
Now I'm dancing in the tide

Fly me through the black night
You're the angel in the new light
Running through the thunder
I need to cover, so for low, low

You're the one that can make me stay
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
You're the one that's been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my eye
You're the one that can turn the page
You're the one that gave me light in another gage
Now I'm dancing in the tide

You're the one that can make me stay
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
You're the one that's been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my eye
You're the one that can turn the ṗage
You're the one that gave me light in another gage
Now I'm dancing in the tide

You're the one that can make me stay
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
You're the one that's been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my eye
You're the one that can turn the page
You're the one that gave me light in another gage
Now I'm dancing in the tide

Yeah I'm dancing in the darkness
Three years before I was feeling so heartless
But your bright shined through
Now I'm drinking love ṗotion
On my late nights too (?)

It's a criminal feeling
Happiness cries and the tears are dreaming
My body is screaming
I'm staying right here
No I'll never be leaving
