It was dawn and the kitchen light was still on
I stepped in, found the suicide asleep on the floor
An open mouth screams and makes no sound
Apart from the ring of the tinnitus of silence
You had your ear to the ground
White noise
I don't know if there's breathing or not
Butterflied arms tell me that this one has flown
Blood seems black against the skin of your porcelain back
A still life is the last I will see of you
A painting of a panic attack
He died in his sleep last night
He died in his sleep last night
He died in his sleep last night
He died in his sleep last night
You died in his sleep last night
You died in his sleep last night
You died in his sleep last night
You died in his sleep last night
You died in his sleep last night
You died in his sleep last night
Death dreams you don't forget
It's been a while since I dreamed this but
Even now, when asleep, I'll tread with care
Death dreams you don't forget
It's been a while since I dreamed this but
Even now, when asleep, I'll tread with care
Death dreams I don't forget
It's been a while since I dreamed this but
Even now, when asleep, I'll tread with care
Death dreams I don't forget
It's been a while since I dreamed this but
Even now, when asleep, I'll tread with care
