You catch a shooting star
You tell me make a wish
Your word is all I know
But if the plane is moving fast
Please secure your mask
Before you put mine on

And now the rain is falling
The truth is bittersweet
A different voice is calling
Where have you gone sweet innocence?

Where have you gone sweet innocence?

Now you ask me what to say
It used to be your way
Was the only way I'd known
But when the table starts to turn
The teacher starts to learn
The child starts to grow

And now the rain is falling
The truth is bittersweet
A different voice is calling
Where have you gone sweet innocence?

Where have you gone sweet innocence?
I Wonder
