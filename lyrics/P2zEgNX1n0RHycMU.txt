Ooh, you were really really good last night
Ooh, I could do that twenty something more times
And I, I know better than to play along then you came along
And I, oh I'm thinking maybe I should call you but no

'Cause now's not the time to be hasty
Oh my God, oh goodness gracious
I'm so damn close I can taste ya

And I hate that I'm conflicted
This addiction's got me twisted on you
I'm conflicted, contradictive
Got my body confused
I'm yes or no, I will, I won't
I'm conflicted and addicted
So come over and make up my mind

Ooh, you're looking really really good tonight
Ooh, I bet you wore that just to blow my mind
And I, I meant never when I swore you off but you turn me on
And I, I was thinking maybe I should kiss you but no

Babe, I don't got time to be wasting
Oh my God, oh goodness gracious
You're so damn close I could take ya

[Chorus]at I'm conflicted
This addiction's got me twisted on you
I'm conflicted, contradictive
Got my body confused
I'm yes or no, I will, I won't
I'm conflicted and addicted
So come over and make up my mind

I'm yes or no, I will, I won't
I'm yes or no, I do, I don't

Ooh, you were really really good last night
Ooh, you always seem to know just what I like
And I, I'm gonna quit you for the millionth time
And I swear this time
But I, I was thinking just one more wouldn't hurt

(I'm conflicted, this addiction's got me twisted on you)
I'm conflicted, contradictive
Got my body confused
I'm yes or no, I will, I won't
I'm conflicted and addicted
So come over and make up my mind
So come over and make up my mind
Now come over and make up my mind
