It doesn't hurt me
Do you wanna feel how it feels?
Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me?
Do you wanna hear about the deal that I'm making?

You
It's you and me

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say if I only could, oh

You don't wanna hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder
Oh, there is thunder in our hearts
Is there so much hate for the ones we love?
Oh, tell me we both matter don't we?

You
It's you and me
It's you and me won't be unhappy

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say if I only could

You
It's you and me
It's you and me won't be unhappy

C'mon baby, c'mon darlin'
Let me steal this moment from you now
Come on angel, c'mon, c'mon darling
Let's exchange the experience, oh

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problem

Say if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
Be running up that road, be running up that hill
With no problem

Say if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problem
Say if I only could
Be running up that hill
With no problem

If I only could, I'd be running out that hill
If I only could, I'd be running out that hill
