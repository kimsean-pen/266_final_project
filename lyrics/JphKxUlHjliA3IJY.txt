yeah, I don't know where to start
how do you admit that you're falling apart
i mean how will i admit that I'm falling apart
my mother's gonna worry but I'm fine in my heart
I've lived the words that I've said
and I live with a voice that tends to tell me that I'm shit in my head
and well, maybe I should fuck it and be happy instead
I should just say "fuck it" and be happy instead, right? right
'cus guess what, people try to tell me how to deal with myself
but I'm not gonna listen if you mention my health
I don't care
don't tell me and don't text me
'cus that kind of shit upsets me, just kind of affects me
its bringing me down and I'm not gonna lie
these days I prefer to just not be outside
and these days I just end up spending all of my time
with my girlfriend, but to be honest, I think thats alright
'cus time keeps rollin' and I'm just making songs
I'm doing my best
to find myself stressed
and I'm no longer sure where i belong
I'm starting to rust
don't know who to trust
(dont trust anyone, not even me)
some people concentrate on style too much
but I think I just force myself to smile too much
and that should soon end for the best
I wanna live my life with no stress
love life and feel blessed
its kind of funny on the inside
im tryin' to be a man, but really i'm just a little child
and thats pretty much it
yeah thats pretty much it
(is there anything else?)
oh yeah
my jaw hurts a lot because I grind it with stress (uhuh)
I was an idiot recently and lost a lot of my friends (nar)
nothing brings me joy and nothing makes me smile
being at school makes me aware how I haven't been myself in awhile (oh)
and I wonder what it was like to be 11
wonder if theres such a thing as life after death, such a thing as heaven (why?)
every now and then I think about the fact that id become a legend if I died at 27
