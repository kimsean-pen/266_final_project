Groovin'
on a Sunday afternoon
Really
couldn't get away too soon

I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There ain't no place I'd like to be instead of

Groovin'
down a crowded avenue
Doin'
anything we'd like to do

There's always lots of things that we could see
We could be anyone we wanna be
And all those happy people we could meet just

Groovin'
on a Sunday afternoon
Really baby
I couldn't get away too soon
...

We'll keep on spending sunny days this way
We're gonna talk and laugh our time away
I feel it comin' closer day by day
Life would be ecstasy, you and me endlessly

Groove!
on a Sunday afternoon
Ohhh really
I couldn't get away too soon, baby
'Cause darling yoooou set me groovin'
