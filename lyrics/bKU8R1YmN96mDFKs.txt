White blades of sorrow lacerate the ground
He knows that winter is unfair and strong
Thus left the time of these sweetest walks
In the light of stars

When all things were frozen he ventured away
He knows that some things are kept safe until May
In his mind these words kept spinning around
Seasons may change...
We're enslaved to the ground

When he came here he felt he'd left nothing behind
For years he'd been crawling and turning blind
He killed all sound... and deaf...
He ran away from their world, their endless gold chains
To come to this dead land of frozen rains
He took a vow of silence there and entered the world he felt was his

Now that he's standing on the edge of his land
He's facing the great sea, the sky in his hand
Yearning to take that final step
He heard this sound...
We're enslaved to the ground
