Here we are
Seven days and seven nights of empty tries
This ritual's habitual
But it's never gonna work this time
We're to the point of no return
And along the way the only thing we've learned
Is how to hurt each other

I'm looking back and wondering why
It took so long to realize
That nothing's changed, it never will
All these years of standing still
And still we stay in all this pain
And nothing's going to make it go away, yeah

I don't want to wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind
Baby, you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No, you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't want to wait another minute to hear
It's something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
It's something that I already know
I know, I know, I know

So save your voice, don't waste your breath
Can't you see we're at the end
And this goodbye, if it's permanent
So wish me well, try to forget
And all the fights and all the ways
We almost made it but we never did
And it's finally come to this

I don't want to wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind
Baby, you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No, you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't want to wait another minute to hear
Something that I already know

We cannot hide what we've become
So sick and tired of being numb
It's done, it's done, it's done

I don't want to wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind
Baby, you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No, you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
I don't want to wait another minute to hear
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
Yes, I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
I know, 'cause I know
