I found a place to belong so I went all in
I walked right in the mouth of it and never looked back again
The only thing that remains through the loss and the pain
As for me there was no other choice
I'm married to the noise

We've been pushed to the side while the fake walk the line
I've seen it all my life
You praise what is weak and keep carrying on
You cannot kill my will to belong

What's inside me still pushes on

I don't care if you can't see what I see. I'm still here. No, I don't care
I never needed a reason. Yeah, I'm still here

Through and through
This has always been my truth
And it can't be killed
So I won't let you crush what we built
Lost on you
Somewhere along the line you forgot
What this meant to all of us
And I've had enough

I don't care if you can't see what I see. I'm still here. No, I don't care
I never needed a reason. Yeah, I'm still here
So keep rolling your eyes. I'd rather be dead than settle with your way of life. So I don't care what you think about me. Yeah, I'm still here

Through the loss and the pain
The only thing that remains
And I was finally heard through the pain of my voice
As for me there was no other choice

I don't care if you can't see what I see. I'm still here. No, I don't care
I never needed a reason. Yeah, I'm still here
So keep rolling your eyes. I'd rather be dead than settle with your way of life. So I don't care what you think about me. Yeah, I'm still here

The only thing that remains through the loss and the pain
As for me there was no other choice
I'm married to the noise
