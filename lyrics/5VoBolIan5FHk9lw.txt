Well, I've been thinkin' 'bout the future
I'm too young to pretend
It's such a waste
To always look behind you
You should be lookin' straight ahead

Yeah I'm gonna have to move on
Before we meet again
Yeah it's hard
If you had only seen

Ten thirty-four, Flinders Street Station
I'm lookin' down the tracks
A uniform man
Askin' how-I'm-a-pay-it-all
Why would I wanna be there

Yeah I'm gonna have to move on
Before we meet again
Yeah it's hard
If you had only seen
Take control
And don't be afraid of me

Every once in a while
You think about if you're gonna
Get yourself together
You should be happy just to be alive
And just because
You just don't feel like, coming home
Don't mean that you'll never arrive

Yeah, I'm gonna have to move on
Before we meet again
Yeah it's hard
If you had only seen
Take control
Don't be afraid of me
