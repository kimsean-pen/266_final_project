I've been sat around just thinking about those golden days
in many ways, i know thats wrong.
we've felt from time to time we've kissed we've tried but God knows that's all gone
Babe we were f*cked up all along.

I never had a light behind my eyes
But i always loved the way it looked on you.
You swept me off my feet in record time.
I'm not sure if i can manage without you.

We'll both admit defeat when its the end.
We'll both smile and nod and know our time is through
but in my heart you'll always be a friend
cause' i'm not sure i can manage without you.
