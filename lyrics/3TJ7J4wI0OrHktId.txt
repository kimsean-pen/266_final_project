You've been there for so long.
Have you found all the choices you have?
Once you know what to do,
Have your thoughts on the way you behave
Open your eyes now. Don't be afraid
Find the connection knowing yours and others' fate
Call it divine or call it insane
I say life is flowing much beyond your veins

Take the best that you have
Realize that your talents are there
What you aim for so much
Tell me, why do you want it so bad?
Open your eyes now. Don't be afraid
Find the connection knowing yours and others' fate
Call it divine or call it insane
I say life is flowing much beyond your veins

The father the star
The tinier the grain of sand
They came from the same start
And will be led towards the same end
What's the image of you?
Exactly how do you picture yourself?

Open your eyes now. Don't be afraid
Find the connection knowing yours and others' fate
Call it divine or call it insane
I say life is flowing much beyond your veins
Much beyond the time, far beyond the space
Something you can feel within but never understand
