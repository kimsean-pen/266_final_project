The future of the future will still contain the past
Where time goes slow and time goes fast
I can feel you looking back at me to see how i've got
on
What is it eating at you that makes you want me now
i'm gone

It's so bright tonight
It's so bright tonight
It's so bright tonight
Do you see those cars, those light's?

The future of the future will still repeat today
Where time goes fast then fades away
You say "think of the old days, we could have them
back again"
Well i've thought about the old days and they'd go bad
Like they did then

It's so bright tonight
It's so bright tonight
It's so bright tonight
Do you see those cars, those light's?

The future of the future will still contain tonight
The passage of day, the passage of light
And i'm not going home again, tomorrow will never come

And i'm not going home again, tomorrow will never come

But it's so bright tonight
It's so bright tonight
Do you see those cars, those light's?
Do you see these roads, these sights?

What are you gonna do about me now?
What are you gonna do about me now?
It's so bright tonight
