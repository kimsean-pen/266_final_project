Listen man I got the window open, hear the cats?
Listen

Mouthful of cavities
And your soul's a bowl of jokes
And everyday you remind me
How I'm desperately in need

See, I got a lot of fiends around
And they're peeking through and nothing new
They see you
They see everything you do
Everything you do

See everything on the inside out

Oh, please give me a little more
And I'll push away those baby blues
'Cause one of these days, this will die
So will me and so will you

I write a letter to a friend of mine
I tell him how much I used to love to watch him smile
See, I haven't seen him smile in a little while

Haven't seen him smile in a little while

But I know you're laughing from the inside out
Laughing from the inside out
I know you're laughing on the inside out
Laughing from the inside
From the inside
From the inside out
