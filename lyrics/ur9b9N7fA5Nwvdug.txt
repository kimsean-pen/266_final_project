I was shaking from the neck down,
Shaking down, down to my toes.
Wondered if I'd ever feel that cold again,
If I'd ever see that snow. (If I'd ever see that snow.)

People always talking and moving about. (Moving about...)
People always moving and talking about. (Talking about...)
Hard times.

I was a little older now but I still need
Everyone I know.
Money (money) means a little more and more,
Yeah, we all need it, at least they tell me so.

People always talking and moving about. (Moving about...)
People always moving and talking about. (Talking about...)
Hard times.
Talking 'bout hard times.
Talking 'bout hard times.

I think about all the times that have passed and
All the times still to come,
Will we ever, ever live together again?
Or did we ever at all? (Did we ever at all?)

People always talking and moving about. (Moving about...)
People always moving and talking about. (Talking about...)
Hard times.
