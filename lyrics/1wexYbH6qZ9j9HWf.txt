wrap me up in always, and drag me in with maybes
your innocence is treasure, your innocence is death
your innocence is all i have
breathing underwater, and living under glass
and if you spin your love around
the secrets of your dreams
you may find your love is gone
and is not quite what it seemed
to appear to disappear
beneath all your darkest fears
i believe in never, i believe in all the way
but belief is not to notice, believe is just some faith
and faith can't help you to escape
and with this ring i wed thee true
and with this ring i wed thee now
and with this ring i play so dead
but no one's asking for the truth, so let me tell you
if you spin your love around
the secrets of your dreams
you may find your love is gone
and is not quite what it seemed
to appear to disappear
beneath all your darkest fears
to the revelations of fresh faced youth
no one will come to save you
so speak your peace in the murmurs drawn
but youth is wasted on the young
your strength is my weakness, your weakness my hate
my love for you just can't explain
why we're forever frozen, forever beautiful,
forever lost inside ourselves
the night has come to hold us young
