Let's get this straight!

I'm fine without you
I'm not your fucking prey
So save yourself
And no one else

What you believe
What you believe
What you believe
Your life is a lie
Get over it
Get over it
Get over it

You got the best of me
And stabbed me in the back
I taste you on my teeth
You're like a heart attack
And I'm not okay
I'm headed down the drain
I still feel safe
Down here where I belong

So where were you
When I fell out
Went back into the dark
I'm lost again
So don't come find me

What you believe
What you believe
What you believe
Your life is a lie
Get over it
Get over it
Get over it

You got the best of me
And stabbed me in the back
I taste you on my teeth
You're like a heart attack
And I'm not okay
I'm headed down the drain
I still feel safe
Down here where I belong

One day you might be hungry
One day you might be hungry
One day you might be hungry
One day you might be hungry

You got the best of me
And stabbed me in the back
I taste you on my teeth
You're like a heart attack
And I'm not okay
I'm headed down the drain
I still feel safe
Down here where I belong
