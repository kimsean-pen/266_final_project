No voices here
Above a small and fragile sphere
Hang on every word
Yet no one hears us speak
So, it's only left to ask
Is change too great a task?
From the smallest steps
Waves transforms the earth

Highest heights
As we sail into the heavens
Skyward, light of lights
Godspeed, you satellites
Stand and watch and wait
To see the trails that cross the heavens
Eternal light of lights
We're all just satellites

Oh my love, be brave for me
Accept the fact it can be better
Don't let this world go down without a fight
And I still hold the firm belief
That we borrow from our children
And we pay the price in this life or the next

Highest heights
As we sail into the heavens
Skyward, light of lights
Godspeed, you satellites
Stand and watch and wait
To see the trails that cross the heavens
Eternal light of lights
We're all just satellites

Highest heights
As we sail into the heavens
Skyward, light of lights
Godspeed, you satellites
Stand and watch and wait
To see the trails that cross the heavens
Eternal light of lights
We're all just satellites
