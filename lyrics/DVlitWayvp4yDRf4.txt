Back in time before they crossed the line
And the truth was made of gold
Cross of paths that was based on the past
Or so the story goes
Strike fear and the end draws near
And the peasants wore a blindfold
Stack 'em up, stack 'em up, burn 'em down
And the peace remains unknown

Burdened by a faith
Lost without a trace
Crippled by the tools
Made by the hands of fools
Start the fire
And cast the first stone

"Teach me", said the God to the king
"This is all the things I see"
Mean man just doesn't understand
But he does it all for me
Take a stand, beat the devil's hand
You'll be dreaming on a bed of nails
Last prayer in the Cecil square
Choose a place that you will fail

"Forget it, the war is won"
Said the God behind his son
Desperate hold him down
Beware the cross and crown
Start the fire
And cast the first stone

Calm down, comes without a sound
And the peace remains unknown
Don't tell you are destined to fail
But you'll be useless on your own
Still refuse to fire as they run born alive
And your soul becomes a stone
Stack 'em up, stack 'em up
To atone his holy flesh and bone

Burdened by a faith
Lost without a trace
Crippled by the fools
Start the fire
"Forget it, the war is won"
Said the God behind his son
Desperate hold him down
Beware the cross and crown
Start the fire
And cast the first stone
Cast the first stone
