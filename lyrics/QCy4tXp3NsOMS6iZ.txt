I feel lonely when you disown me and my friends,
You see you used to know me then, and now my body's under.

We are not your lovers; we are not your friends,
We are just sinners and we're condemned to death.
We are not your lovers; we are not your friends,
Forget what you believe in, cause this is the end.

You can't find nothing at all;
When there's nothing there all alone.
I'm everything that you're not;
Which is what makes you, what makes you...?

We are not your lovers; we are not your friends,
We are just sinners and we're condemned to death.
We are not your lovers; we are not your friends,
Forget what you believe in, cause this is the end.

Take me home, please take me home,
Take me somewhere I want to go,
Take me home, please take me home,
Take me somewhere, I want to go.

We are not your lovers; we are not your friends,
We are just sinners and we're condemned to death.
We are not your lovers; we are not your friends,
Forget what you believe in, cause this is the end.
