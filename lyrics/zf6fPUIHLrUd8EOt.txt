Self love, self love, self love
Self love
Self love, self love, self love

She never saw you crying
Wasn't here to hold him back from her
Understand why you go for the runs, go on the hunts
Haven't seen what I've seen
Trying not to focus
But I am focused on me, my own space to be
Not too unnatural that it's forced on me
For outsiders to see
Questioning myself when others ask me for my status
Relationships never came easy to me
Too many issues floating around me
Times been approaching, creeping all slowly
Self love never came that easy to me
Taking its toll on me

Selfless, selfless, don't be
Selfless, selfless, don't be

I don't know if I don't try this 'cause I don't know how
Going with the wrong setting of this scene between you and me
How can I be insecure and still find someone else
Responsible for my own self
Should keep away, secure in my cage
Unsure if you've understood the importance that lies in your base
Not so solid concrete located where floors place
Your shell will be empty

Selfless, selfless, don't be
Selfless, selfless, don't be

Self love, self love, self love
Self love
Self love, self love, self love
