Keep your eyes on the road, your hands upon the wheel
Keep your eyes on the road, your hands upon the wheel
Yeah, we're going to the roadhouse
We're gonna have a real
Good time

Back at the roadhouse, some bungalows
Yeah, back at the roadhouse they got some bungalows
And that's for the people
Who like to go down slow

Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, all night long

Ashen lady, ashen lady
Give up your vows, said you got give up your vows
You got to save our city
You got to save our city
Right now, baby, right now

I woke up this morning, I got myself a beer
I woke up this morning, I got myself a beer
The future's uncertain, end is always near

Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
All night long

Let it roll, roll, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll
