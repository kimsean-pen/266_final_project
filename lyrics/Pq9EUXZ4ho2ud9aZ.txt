Once I was told that a boy caught a cold
And he left to go home to get some sleep instead
Well his baby stayed where she was
I go talk to her cause I wanna sleep with her

And you would only hold me
If I would never tell you it would end
And you would never have me
Cause you were only wanting to be friends
And you would always hold out
Till he gave out

Now that he's back I'm afraid
You'll go back to his bed where I know he'll try to keep you
Well I'm well aware of what she does
She won't leave me because I sleep with her

And you would only hold me
If I would never tell you it would end
And you would never have me
Cause you were only wanting to be friends
And you would always hold out
Till you gave out
