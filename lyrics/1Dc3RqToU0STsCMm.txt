Alone
No more!

Her broken heart, her broken heart! Call me in
the doctor only i can mend this wound
We'll stitch it up! We'll stitch it up!
and we can act and pretend like this never happened
love's lost in your eyes
They glow, and shine, and hypnotize
They terrorize!, they terrorize!
She yells aloud, she screams, she cries

so let's pretend this went exactly as we had intended
So dry your tears, no more fears
we'll scream, "Let's go get it!"
and when the world, it turns its back on you, I'll be waiting here for you
No regrets, don't you quit
we'll scream, "Let's go get it!"
Let's go get it!

You sit there in the dark cause you feel empty inside
Your mind's caught in a loop screaming, "What's happened to my life?!"
It's a heart aching, stale feeling, but don't fear
Just listen to my words, they're words you might want to hear
You feel like it's all over, there's nothing you can do
But listen to me when I say that time it heals all wounds
You feel empty, lost, and broken inside
You'll be fine, You'll be mine, Every day's a new sunrise!

so let's pretend this went exactly as we had intended
So dry your tears, no more fears
we'll scream, "Let's go get it!"
and when the world, it turns its back on you, I'll be waiting here for you
No regrets, don't you quit
we'll scream, "Let's go get it!"

I'll pick you up show you you're not alone, my arms are your new home
it's worth the pain, worth the risk
waiting for your special kiss
when all is dark and loss is all you know
just search, you'll find a home
it's worth the pain, worth the risk
waiting for your special kiss

They terrorize!, they terrorize!
She yells aloud, she screams, she cries
love's lost in your eyes
They glow, and shine, and hypnotize They terrorize!, they terrorize!
She yells aloud, she screams, she cries

I'll pick you up show you you're not alone, my arms are your new home
it's worth the pain, worth the risk
waiting for your special kiss
when all is dark and loss is all you know
just search, you'll find a home
it's worth the pain, worth the risk
waiting for your special kiss
