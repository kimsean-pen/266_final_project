Another day, another night got me thinkin'
What is it with him, he's naturally moving slow
I see him at the corner bar, am I dreamin'?
Surrounded by friends, it's got to end, I need to know

Am I just a night of lust? A lost temptation
Is someone like me, his destiny he'll never know
I gotta find a way to show my expectations
He ends it where it begins but I won't let go

I know you don't love me
But still I burn for you
I know you don't love me
This flame will die, it's true

My soul barred completely
Don't seem enough for you
I know you don't love me
But the message can't get through

Any man can see that I'm worth the talkin'
Love can be bittersweet when a girl hears "No"
Opportunity knocks but your doors don't open
But I feel a fire inside that's about to blow

So, sweep me off my feet and show me something different
You know all the tricks, come get your kicks, you know I'm game
You gotta understand a girl needs more than romance
How many chances lost till you just run away?

I know you don't love me
But still I burn for you
I know you don't love me
This flame will die, it's true

My soul barred completely
Don't seem enough for you
I know you don't love me
But the message can't get through

Maybe I'm missing the telepathy
There's a disconnection, you don't think of me
I don't really care because I disagree
'Cause I'm the only part of you that you don't see

Maybe I'm missing the telepathy
There's a disconnection, you don't think of me
I don't really care because I disagree
'Cause I'm the only part of you that you don't see

I know you don't love me
But still I burn for you
I know you don't love me
This flame will die, it's true

My soul barred completely
Don't seem enough for you
I know you don't love me
But the message can't get through

(I know you don't love me)
I know you don't love me
(But still I burn for you)
But still I burn for you
(I know you don't love me)

(This flame will die, it's true)
This flame will die, it's true
(My soul barred completely)
Don't seem enough for you
I know you don't love me
