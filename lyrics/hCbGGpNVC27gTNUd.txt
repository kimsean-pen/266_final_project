A spell to free all matter
Folding time and gravity
A universe to shatter
Conjuring black holography

Unraveling the ether
Rending screeching molecules
Severing the elements
Ripping core from core

Sorcery's caustic breath
Fills the void between the spheres
The archetypes are gathering
At the other end of genesis

Ylem
Rise from oblivion
Initiate the grand corrosion
Ylem
Awaken, demand omega
The web constricts around quivering hearts

Spectres swell
From my hands
I feel my mind vibrating
Virulent black odic force
Bleeding into every cell

Ripe with mortality
A breathless world is shaking
A cosmic avalanche is waking
All shall die

Rise from oblivion
Initiate the great corrosion
Awaken, demand omega
The atoms shall remember

Scourge the moribund
Initiate the great corrosion
Consume me, primordial fire
All atoms shall remember thee

Engulf me
Illuminate my flesh
With sacred necrosis

Ylem
I summon thee
From primeval chaos soar
Devour this misguided spacetime
From the earth
From the heavens
From the emptiness rise
Ylem
From the pores of trembling skin
From the depths of every soul come forth
From the darkness at the heart of everything

Unraveling the maelstrom
Bending screaming galaxies
Severing the constellations
Tearing matters shell
