One, two, three, four!

I fucked up again it's all my fault
So turn me around to face the wall
And read me, my rights and tell me, I am wrong
Until it gets into my thick skull

A slap on the wrist
A stab in the back
Torture me, I've been a bad boy
Nail me to the cross until you have won
I lost before I did any wrong
(She)

(Wooaah)
I'm hexed with regrets and bad luck
So keep your distance it's rubbin' off
Or you will be darned to spend your life in hell
On earth with me tangled at your feets

You finally met your nemesis
Disguised as your fatal long lost love
So kiss it goodbye
Until death do we apart
You fell for a jinx for crying out loud

I'm a curse hanging around you
I'm a curse hanging around you
I'm a curse hanging around you
I'm a curse hanging around you
