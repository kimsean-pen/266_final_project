I take myself home
Turn off my cell phone
Take off all of my clothes
Put on some disco
Don't care what they said
Crawl into my bed
F-f-feeling calm and collected

I want to fill myself with bliss
When I'm alone I exist

Leave the party, leave the party
Don't need to tell nobody
No, no
There's nothing for me here
Leave the party, leave the party
My mind's outside my body
No, no
There's nothing for it here

I paint my pinky toes
I eat my cheerios
Imagine myself in elaborate music videos
I tweeze my eyebrows
Too thin and I frown
Read Wikipedia til my eyelids fall down

I want to fill myself with bliss
When I'm alone I exist

Leave the party, leave the party
Don't need to tell nobody
No, no
There's nothing for me here
Leave the party, leave the party
My mind's outside my body
No, no
There's nothing for it here

Fight or flight
I choose flight, flight
I choose flight
I choose flight
I choose flight, flight
Flight, to flight
I've got to flight
Flight, to flight

Leave the party, leave the party
Don't need to tell nobody
No, no
There's nothing for me here
Leave the party, leave the party
My mind's outside my body
No, no
There's nothing for it here

Fight or flight
I choose flight
