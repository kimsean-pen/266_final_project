First act I wake up to find the hope
To see you simply staring back at me
Still there's only emptiness calling
To break the dream I once believed
Now I'm scared that this reality
Is much too heavy for me
I'm too weak to be strong
I can't be the only one
Holding on till the day you find me, so

Meet me at the end of the world
I'm waiting
Meet me at the end of the world
Please save me
This could be the place where we start the rest of our lives (rest of our lives)
Meet me at the end, the end of the world
Meet me at the end of the world

You found the place I hide within
Like you see right through my skin and my heart
To see I'm hopelessly wishing
You can forgive all my mistakes
Take them back and just erase all the wrong
And let our future get brighter

I'm too weak to be strong
I can't be the only one
Holding on till the day you find me, so

Meet me at the end of the world
I'm waiting
Meet me at the end of the world
Please save me
This could be the place where we start the rest of our lives (rest of our lives)
Meet me at the end, the end of the world
Meet me at the end of the world

Till these shadows disappear
I still wait to find you here
Still I'm haunted from the moment I feared, oh
Never forget what it's like to surrender in your eyes
Holding on till the day you find me, so

Meet me at the end of the world
I'm waiting
Meet me at the end of the world
Please save me
This could be the place where we start the rest of our lives (rest of our lives)

Meet me at the end of the world
I'm waiting
Meet me at the end of the world
Please save me
This could be the place where we start the rest of our lives (rest of our lives)
Meet me at the end, the end of the world
Meet me at the end of the world
