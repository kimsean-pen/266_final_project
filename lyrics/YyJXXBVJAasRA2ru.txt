I'm a little lost, every time we touch
But its all gone, everything's gone
Every time we sober up
I'm feeling like my heart just won't come trough
Like I'm an ocean from you

I'm a little lost, every time we touch
But its all gone, everything's gone
Every time we sober up
I'm feeling like my heart just won't come trough
Like I'm an ocean from you

It's a habit, not to let them in on my distraction
If I learn to taste this waste of skin
It's my destruction

I don't wanna waste my time
Believing in delusions
Living in an ecstasy
Living with the enemy

In my mind it's easy to escape your interruption
Every time you cause me an emotional eruption

Get away, Cause I'm afraid
I need to shake it off me
Living on insanity
Living in a tragedy

I'm a little lost, every time we touch
But its all gone, everything's gone
Every time we sober up
I'm feeling like my heart just won't come trough
Like I'm an ocean from you

I'm a little lost, every time we touch
But its all gone, everything's gone
Every time we sober up
I'm feeling like my heart just won't come trough
Like I'm an ocean from you

Living in a drunken haze
To escape this massive panic
Better sober up this time
Before it's getting tragic

Nothing in my mind
That will remind me of my tangles
Better call a shrink
Better get another drink

Deeper into haze and I'm loosing sense of judgment
Caught up in the night
We're all lost inside a dungeon

Loosing sense of time
And there's nothing left to cover
Living in a haze
Unaware of time and place

I'm a little lost, every time we touch
But its all gone, everything's gone
Every time we sober up
I'm feeling like my heart just won't come trough
Like I'm an ocean from you

I'm a little lost, every time we touch
But its all gone, everything's gone
Every time we sober up
I'm feeling like my heart just won't come trough
Like I'm an ocean from you
