As I stand at the edge of existence
Nameless shores of infinity
Perpetual unbirth unraveling distance
Clandestine truths unveiled

Inborn imperfections preprogrammed shells
Spawning from the maelstrom
Mechanical drones feeding from thy mother
God machine reproduce

Untruth is this my fate
Coerced my life laid to waste

Untruth is this my fate
Coerced my life laid to waste
All hail execution

As this dream comes to its grim end
Blind pray to God to make them men
As all hopes crumble truths unveiled

The world we know's an abysmal hell
Disturbed state of consciousness
Incessant black madness
Perpetual un-birth unraveling distance
Clandestine truths unveiled
Untruth is this my fate
Coerced my life laid to waste
Untruth is this my fate
Coerced my life laid to waste
All hail execution
As this dream comes to its grim end
Blind pray to God to make them men
As all hopes crumble truths unveiled
The world we know's an abysmal hell

Untruth is this my fate
Coerced my life laid to waste
Untruth is this my fate
Coerced my life laid to waste
All hail execution

As this dream comes to its grim end
Blind pray to God to make them men
As all hopes crumble truths unveiled
The world we know's an abysmal...
As this dream comes to its grim end
Blind pray to God to make them men
As all hopes crumble truths unveiled
The world we know's an abysmal...
Hell!
