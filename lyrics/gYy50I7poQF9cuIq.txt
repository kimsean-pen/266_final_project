When she sleeps
There is a fever dream, yeah
It brings a night terror
To haunt this fragile bird

She speaks in tounges
Her words they come undone, yeah
And with the way with mind
She struggles through the night

All that I can do
Is hope she makes it through,
through the night, through the night

These cold nightmares
They make her worse for where
Lost in the dark
She's got a heavy heart

And when she wakes

In her fragile state
When she calls my name
Hopin that I keep her safe

All that I can do
Is hope she makes it through
All that I can do
Is hope she makes it through

Through the night
Through the night
Through the night
Through the night

All that I can do
Is hope she makes it through
All that I can do
Is hope she makes it through
Through the night
