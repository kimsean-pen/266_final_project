Wanna tell you about the girl, I love
My she looks so fine
She's the only one that I been dreamin' of
Maybe someday she will be all mine

I wanna tell her that I love her so
I thrill with her every touch
I need to tell her
She's the only one I really love

I got a woman, wanna ball all day
I got a woman, she won't be true, no
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I said, I got a little woman and she won't be true

On Sunday morning when we go down to church
See the menfolk standin' in line
Don't say they come to pray to the Lord
When my little girl, looks so fine

And in the evening when the sun is sinkin' low
Everybody's with the one they love
I walk the town, keep a-searchin' all around
Lookin' for my street corner girl

I got a woman, wanna ball all day
I got a woman, she won't be true, no no
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I said, I got a little woman and she won't be true

In the bars, with the men who play guitars
Singin', drinkin' and rememberin' the times
And my little lover does the midnight shift
She ball around all the time

I guess there's just one thing a-left for me to do
So I pack my bags and move on my way
'Cause I got a worried mind, sharin' what I thought was mine
Gonna leave her where the guitars play

I got a woman, she won't be true, no no
I got a woman, wanna ball all day, yeah yeah, no no
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
I got a little woman and she won't be true

Hey hey, what can I do?
Oh oh, what can I say?
Hey hey, what can I do?
Oh oh, what can I say?
Hey hey, what can I do?
Oh oh, what can I say?
Hey hey, what can I do?
Hey hey, what can I do?
I got a woman, she won't be true
Lord, hear what I say
I got a woman, wanna ball all day
Oh oh, what can I say?
Hey hey, what can I do?
