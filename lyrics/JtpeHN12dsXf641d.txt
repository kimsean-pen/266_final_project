You could stay
You could win
Steal the truth from the King

You could free all the things
He has kept deep within

And you could finally reach something real
You could be what you feel

And you could leave the lie
You could heal
Be the truth that you could steal

Kill the King
You are free
Take his place and you will see

That you can keep everything
It's all there
Deep within

If you reach what you feel
You can be something real

And you could finally live
You could win
You're the truth
You're the King
