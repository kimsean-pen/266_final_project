I never wanted another
Come over to me and discover
I want to be near you
And you need to be far away
You always seem to make me feel at home

Hey you
People like us
I never know, I never know, I never know, I never know why
You make me want to cry
I never know, I never know, I never know, I never know why
Forever live and die

I look at all of the people
Doing it over and over
You never get any older
I wish that you could be here
I look at you and I make the same mistakes

People like us
I never know, I never know, I never know, I never know why

Forever live and die

I never know, I never know, I never know, I never know why
You make me want to cry
I never know, I never know, I never know, I never know why
Forever live and die

I never know, I never know, I never know, I never know why
You make me want to cry
I never know, I never know, I never know, I never know why
