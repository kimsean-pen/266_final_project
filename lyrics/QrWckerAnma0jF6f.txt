It was way past midnight
And she still couldn't fall asleep
This night the dream was leavin'
She tried so hard to keep
And with the new day's dawning
She felt it drift away
Not only for a cruise
Not only for a day

Too long ago
Too long apart
She couldn't wait another day for
The captain of her heart

As the day came up she made a start
She stopped waiting another day for
The captain of her heart

Too long ago
Too long apart
She couldn't wait another day for
The captain of her heart

Too long ago
Too long apart
She couldn't wait another day for
The captain of her heart

As the day came up
She made a stop
She stopped waiting another day for
The captain of her heart
Too long ago
Too long apart
She couldn't wait another day for
The captain of her heart
