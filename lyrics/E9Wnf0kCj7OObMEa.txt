Haven't you heard that
I'm falling to pieces
It suddenly hit me
If I could go back
And break the silence
The words would still hurt
Once again
I'm at the feet of a mountain
Every day is a struggle
Try to escape through
The eye of a needle
Into reality

And I know that
This comes out of the blue
But I will go through
This burning hell to reach you

I can break all the bones in my body
But it won't change how I feel, change how I feel
I can spend all my days praying prayers
But it won't change what I did, change what I did to you

There it goes
The tip of the iceberg
My life's a disaster
If I could go back
And pick up the pieces
I would still be a fool
Buried alive
Under your silence
We died with the sunset
Now I'm trying
To string up a meaning
From our bone alphabet

I deserve to
Burn in hell to come through
To desert you
Was the best I could do

I can break all the bones in my body
But it won't change how I feel, change how I feel
I can spend all my days praying prayers
But it won't change what I did, change what I did
I can break all the bones in my body
But it won't change how I feel, change how I feel
I can spend all my days praying prayers
But it won't change what I did, change what I did to you
