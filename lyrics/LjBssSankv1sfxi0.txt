Everything carries weight
Everything is the same
Within us, all together

Everything carries weight
Everything is the same
And we are all together

I can't keep my head up
I'd like to stay by my friends
Stay by my friends
But I can't keep my head up
I can't seem to keep my head

Could it be we got lost in the summer?
Well I know you know that it's over
But you're still in
Treading water

But you're still in
Treading water

I'd hate to seem so shallow
I'd like to get deeper in
Swim deeper in
But I can't find the water
I can't seem to find my way

Could it be we got lost in the summer?
Well I know you know that it's over
But you're still in
Treading water

But you're still in

I can't keep my head above ground
(I can't keep my head above ground, can't keep my head)
I can't keep my head above ground
(I can't keep my head above ground, can't keep my head)
I can't keep

But you're still in
Treading water

Could it be we got lost in the summer?
Well I know you know that it's over
But you're still in
Treading water

You can drift along
You've got the time
The rest of us will live and die
Like plastic soldiers
Only growing older
