Driving past the stadium
Humming 'Elegy for Tim'
I saw ten dozen caps and gowns
Peasants disguised in crowns, I felt like a king
When I saw an end as a start
Or his death as just a bit part
A quick hello I might forget, I can say hello
To other people and other people's pets, other people's pets

Merideth at dawn would sit and let me talk away, talk away
Merideth at dawn, I'll pet her as I talk away, talk away
