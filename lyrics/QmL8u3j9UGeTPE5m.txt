One - Two - Three - Go
I've got an ego
It won't let me go
What am I gonna do?

A - B - C - D
Paranoia's killing me
I'm dying on my aching feet
What a way to go

Roll up - Roll up
People always stroll up
Say "Why don't you grow up?"
No thank you!

Big cats, small cats
Some cats are fat cats
Those cats are bad cats
What we gonna do?

There's an awful lot of people in the world today
There's an awful lot of trouble in the streets these days
And it doesn't seem to matter what you do or say
If a change is gonna come you've got to help it on it's way

A change is gonna come before too long I know
Peace has gotta come, well, I could be wrong I know
But I just don't know what I can do

You don't trust me and I don't trust you
I bet you wish you did and I know I do
Why have you got secrets? Cause I know you have
If you've got something to hide then it must be bad

A change is gonna come before too long I know
Peace has gotta come, well, I could be wrong I know
But I just don't know what I can do

You don't trust me and I don't trust you
I bet you wish you did and I know I do
Why have you got secrets? Cause I know you have
If you've got something to hide then it must be bad

A change is gonna come before too long I know
Peace has gotta come, well, I could be wrong I know
But I just don't know what I can do
