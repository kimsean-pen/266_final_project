Frequency so low
Heart on a string
A string that only plays solos
Rain made of arrows
Tidewave rushing on and on
Under the water you scream so loud
But the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud
And you fall
In the deep and I'll always find you
If my red eyes don't see you
Anymore
And I can't hear you though the white noise
Just send your heartbeat out there
To the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor (on that blue ocean floor)
On that blue ocean floor (on that blue ocean floor)
On that blue ocean floor (on that blue ocean floor)
On that blue ocean floor (on that blue ocean floor)
On that blue ocean floor (on that blue ocean floor)
Shell made out of gold
Found on a beach
Picked up and you held so close
Rain washed out it's glow
Heartbeat steady leads me down
Below
Under the water you scream so loud
But the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud
And you fall
In the deep and I'll always find you
If my red eyes don't see you
Anymore
And I can't hear you though the white noise
Just send your heartbeat out there
To the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor (on that blue ocean floor)
On that blue ocean floor (on that blue ocean floor)
On that blue ocean floor (on that blue ocean floor)
On that blue ocean floor (on that blue ocean floor)
On that blue ocean floor (on that blue ocean floor)
20, 000 leagues away, catch up to you on the same day
Travel at the speed of light, thinking the same thought at the same time
Heart beats at a steady pace, I'll let the rhythm show me the way
No one can find us here, fade out and disappear
If my red eyes don't see you
Anymore
And I can't hear you though the white noise
Just send your heartbeat out there
To the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor (on that blue ocean floor)
On that blue ocean floor (on that blue ocean floor)
On that blue ocean floor (on that blue ocean floor)
On that blue ocean floor (on that blue ocean floor)
On that blue ocean floor (on that blue ocean floor)
