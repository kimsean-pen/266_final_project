Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

I don't feel the same
Took all I could take
Hey, rapture, find me now
Said I didn't mind while you strip all my pride
'Cause good love, good love was mine

Broken wings, bones of coal
I used to live clinging to your elbows, oh
Though I try to shake the light
I live inside the sheen of every faint glow

Past love, come back to yourself
Don't keep reaching out to him, he can't help you now
Past life, so come back to the time
It's been far too many nights, and you're still crying

Woke in early morn, feeling something's wrong
Time, take me, I'm moving on
Night won't let me sleep
Wish these days of the week would fade out
Fade out for me

Broken limbs, we're bones of old
Now every word I want to say, I swallow
You shot hot then backfired
But deep inside you cling to every faint glow

Past love, come back to yourself
Don't keep reaching out to him, he can't help you now
Past life, so come back to the time
When you were a little wiser, you're still crying

All you do is cry, all you do is cry
All you do is cry, all you do is cry
All you do is cry, all you do is cry
All you do is cry, all you do is cry

Past love, come back to yourself
Don't keep reaching out to him, he can't help you now
It's a past life, so come back to the time
It's been far too many nights, and you're still crying

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Come back to yourself, he can't help you now
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
So come back to yourself, he can't help you now
Past love, come back to yourself, ah
Past love, come back to yourself, ah
