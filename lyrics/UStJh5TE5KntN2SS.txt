Prodigia comploratus
Silens, oro
Regnet exitium.
Days of warning
Night brings morning
My prayers worthless
Heaven is burning down

I walk stricken
Pitch black vision
Oh One, save me
Caress my weary eyes

Darkest Lord
Your mercy shall I gain
Strike the match
Engulf the earth in flames

In flames, In flames, In flames

Nature quaking
Prophets aching

I kneel faithful
Damnation cracks the sky
My heart fiction
Superstition

Your grace deathless
Give life to my last breath
Darkest Lord
Your mercy shall I gain

Strike the match
Engulf the earth in flames
In flames, In flames, In flames

(Grant them eternal rest, oh Lord
Embrace them into your army of undead
Strike with vengeance those who oppose your will
And lay waste to all those who shall be sent before you
Walk with them and shield them from the blinding light of servitude
And devastate your enemies as they die by your hand.
Amen)

Prodigia comploratus
Silens, oro
Regnet exitium.

Rise from ashes
Violence clashes my soul vacant
Cleanse me of all this sin
I stand guilty
I bleed filthy
Born of fire
Savor this final hour
Darkest Lord
Your mercy shall I gain
Strike the match
Engulf the earth in flames
In flames, In flames, In flames
