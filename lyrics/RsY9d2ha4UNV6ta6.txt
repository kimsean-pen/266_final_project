The collapsing veins are empty
The stars are less bright tonight
The future is moving farther away
From defeated eyes
Your words can't touch me
While your past weighs down your life
Your heart can't love me
While your past still haunts you inside
The past still hunts you
The past still follows you
You, all I had to give you
We are echoes in the well
