Love, just while love, just while love remembers
Just while love, just while love, just while love remembers

Unknow as hard as it seems
Decide it and feel light on the breeze

And it's alright, you can lean it, you can lean it, you can lean it
You can lean it, you can lean it
You can lean it on me

And I know it's all you can see and to shake it
To make it fall from the tree
And you're called into the water
And it holds you like a tropical disease

And you lean into the weather and it drops you, drops you

Just while love remembers
I was given these lungs
And I won't be ashamed no more
We were ripped from those arms
They no longer protect us

Just while love remembers
I was given these lungs
And I won't be ashamed no more
We were ripped from those arms
They no longer protect us

Unknow pour me away
You can pour me, pour me
Pour me away

Just while love remembers
I was given these lungs
And I won't be ashamed no more
We were ripped from those arms
They no longer protect us

Just while love remembers
I was given these lungs
And I won't be ashamed no more
We were ripped from those arms
They no longer protect us

Just while love, just while love remembers
Just while love, just while love, just while love remembers
Just while love, just while love remembers
