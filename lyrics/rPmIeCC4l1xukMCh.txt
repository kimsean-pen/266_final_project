Swimming in the river ascending
Free of fear, filled with purpose
Nishikigoi fights through oceans of adversity
Against the current to obtain the highest goals

Swim through oceans of suffering
Climb to the falls of Dragon Gate
Become
Transform from Koi into a beast
Dragon

A living symbol of courage
No wave will shatter these scales (shatter the scales)
Dreams of three eagle claws and the paws of a tiger
Waterfall's up ahead, one thing left to do

Swim through oceans of suffering
Climb to the falls of Dragon Gate
Become
Transform from Koi into a beast
Dragon

You'll never stop the becoming, yeah
This dragon will rise and be king

All bear witness to a great form
Evolution is complete
A breath that turns into clouds producing rain or fire
Watch the world move according to each desire

Swim through oceans of suffering
Swim through oceans of suffering
Climb to the falls of Dragon Gate
Become
Transform from koi into a beast
Dragon
