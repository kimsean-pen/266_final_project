They all were there
The court was full
The king beside his queen
His love was cold
The fool will dance for her
Till end of time

The queen is in love
The queen is in love

She couldn't help her burning heart
And now he's burning too
Their love was blind
They will dance until
The end of time

Queen is in love
Queen is in love

Queen is in love
Queen is in love

The furious king now has learned
He sentenced them to burn
Forever one
They are joined in death
Eternally

Queen is in love
Queen is in love
Queen is in love
Queen is in love
