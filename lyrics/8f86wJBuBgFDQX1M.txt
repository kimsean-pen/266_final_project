Ruled by the fragile bloodline
Vicious cycle breeded by lies
Cowardice seeps through pride
Lock the door, future torn
Systematic burden rears a world forlorn

Forced down, death bound, no rest for us
Scratch and fight to be secure
Doomed from the start, evil has slithered to the top
Perserverance is to far to achieve
Social schism of the flesh
Held captive, bent at the knees

Hope has locked the door
No regard for the oath you swore
Crimes born of flesh, your ego soars
You've taken lives, now I want yours

I'll sink my teeth into your world

Nothing recedes pain inflicted
But with my voice i'll fire conviction through your fucking head
Out spills the blood of millions
Centuries of injustice laid out on the floor
Captive of your law
