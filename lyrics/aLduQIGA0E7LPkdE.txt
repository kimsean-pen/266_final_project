Baby, baby, baby, from the day I saw you
I really really wanted to catch your eye
There's something special 'bout you, I must really like you
'Cause not a lotta guys are worth my time
Ooh baby, baby, baby, it's gettin' kind of crazy
'Cause you are takin' over my mind

And it feels like ooh
But you don't know my name
And I swear
It feels like ooh
You don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know?)

Oh baby baby baby, I see us on our first date
You're doin' everything that makes me smile
And when we had our first kiss, it happened on a Thursday
Ooh it set my soul on fire
Ooh baby baby baby, I can't wait for the first time
My imagination's runnin' wild

It feels like ooh
You don't know my name
And I swear it baby
It feels like ooh
You don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know?)

I'm sayin', he don't even know what he's doin' to me
Got me feelin' all crazy inside, I'm feelin' like, ow ooh

Doin' more than I've ever done for anyone's attention
Take notice of what's in front of you
'Cause did I mention, you're 'bout to miss a good thing?
And you'll never know how good it feels to have all of my affection
And you'll never get a chance to experience my lovin' ow

'Cause my lovin' feels like ooh
You don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know?)
And I swear it feels like ooh
You don't know my name oh

Will you ever know it? No no no no no, no no

Well I'ma just have to go ahead and call this boy
Hello? Can I speak to, to Michael?
Oh hey, how you doin'?
Uh, I feel kinda silly doin' this but uh

This is the waitress from the coffee house on 39th and Lennox
You know, the one with the braids?
Yeah, well I see you on Wednesdays all the time
You come in every Wednesday on your lunch break, I think

And you always order the special with the hot chocolate
And my manager be trippin' and stuff
Talkin' 'bout we gotta use water
But I always use some milk and cream for you
'Cause, I think you're kinda sweet

Anyway, you always got on some fly blue suit
An' your cufflinks are shinin' all bright
So, whatchu do? Oh, word? Yeah, that's interestin'

Look man, I mean, I don't wanna waste your time but
I know girls don't usually do this
But I was wonderin' if maybe we could get together
Outside the restaurant one day

Ya know, 'cause I do look a lot different outside my work clothes
I mean we could just go across the street to the park right here
Wait, hold up, my cell phone's breakin' up, hold up
Can you hear me now? Yeah

So, what day did you say?
Oh yeah, Thursday's perfect, man

You don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know?)
