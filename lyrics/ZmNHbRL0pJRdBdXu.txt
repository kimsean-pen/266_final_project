Destiny, no one knows
You're dignity, that never showed
It doesn't matter if you thought it through
The only righteous thing to do, is, move
So you're legacy, is on the road
(Away away away from)

Snakes slither through you're eyes
Wicked what a good disguise
I see how you're playing nice
I've been seeing through you're lies
Snakes slither through you're eyes
Wicked what a good disguise
I see how you're playing nice
I see through you're lies

You're on your own now
You're on your own now

You're history, so unforeseen
Such a mystery, how you deceived (oh y you deceived now)
It doesn't matter if you thought it through
The only righteous thing to do is move
So you're enemy, you're shadow
(Away away away from)

Snakes slither through you're eyes
Wicked what a good disguise
I see how you're playing nice
I've been seeing through you're lies
Snakes slither through you're eyes
Wicked what a good disguise
I see how you're playing nice
I've been seeing through you're lies

You're on your own now
You're on your own now

Say what you want to say
Cut, record, now smash that play
Don't agree you're policy, apology
Is way to late yeah
You wannabe
Why can't you see
The psycho price damn right you are a nominee

You're on you're own now
You're on you're o- own now
