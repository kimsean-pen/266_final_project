You'll Never Know
Look what you have gone and done
You fool
The best was yet to come
What a childish game to play
You had it all
And threw it all away

You were not the first my love
Don't kid yourself
You sure won't be the last
You have just yourself to blame
A fool's a fool
By any other name

You'll never know you'll never know
You'll never know you'll never know
You'll never know
How close we came

Nothing but the best for you would do
My love was vintage wine
Now your just a memory
You've gone from me
Just so much wasted time
You can rest assured that I won't cry
Tears where never quite my style
I stopped crying long ago
With life erased forever from my mind

You'll never know you'll never know
You'll never know you'll never know
You'll never know You'll never know
You'll never know
How hard I tried

you'll never know you'll never know
you'll never know you'll never know
We could of had it all
You'll never know
How hard I tried

Your just a memory
You've gone from me ooooo

You have just yourself to blame
A fool's a fool
By any other name

You'll never know you'll never know
Oh what a foolish game to play
You'll never know you'll never know
you'll never know you'll never know
You had it all
And you threw it away

You'll never know you'll never know
You threw it all away
You'll never know you'll never know
You'll never know you'll never know
You never know how hard I tried
You'll never know you'll never know
You'll never know you'll never know
You'll never know you'll never know
You never know how hard I tried (how close we came)
You'll never know you'll never know
You'll never know you'll never know
You'll never know you'll never know
