These the hands that have always held me
From the cradle down to the floor
The soul that you've passed on to me
Won't you tell me what it's for

It's like I've harnessed myself
To nothing as the skin starts to peel off
My blood is a raging river
Surging through my veins
Better give up the ghost before it wakes
When you act like I'm nothing to you
Make me feel like I've been replaced
I could tear you apart
Leave a brand new scar
Better give up the ghost before it wakes
Give up the ghost before it wakes

There's an ending on the horizon
I'll be here after you are gone
To shower you with black roses
And I will bury you with my love

Better give up the ghost before it wakes
Give up the ghost before it wakes
