Something got hold of me
Oh, yes it did! I said
Something got hold of me
It ratttled around my head...
I went to a meeting last night
But, my heart wasn't right
Something got hold of me
Oh, eys it did! I said
Something got hold of me
It ratttled around my head
Early one morning
On the mourner's bench
My heart it was filled misery
The same god that touched you one day
He laid his hand on me!
