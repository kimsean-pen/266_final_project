We got back, it's not the same
And I'm afraid to say it out loud
Then you replied, "Could I have done something?"
You've got some nerve asking me now
Though I'm in love with it, I will amputate
I care enough not to keep you around
Is it rough for you? I can't bear the weight
You look at me when I let you down

Tell me, is this how it goes when you let someone know
That they gave it their best but you still gotta roll?
Remember, I told you that we would be closer
If we took some time further apart

Didn't it make you better?
Aren't we better now?
I know it made me better
Aren't we better now?

Been six months since my birthday
And it feels good to hear your voice
We took a ride through the hills
Replayed all of the reasons I made that choice
We go around the bed
Only to reveal what we couldn't see before
We're better off as friends, baby, you can't stay
We both know we're not there anymore

Tell me, is this how it goes when you let someone know
That it's all for the best? We cut and we grow
Remember, I told you that we would be closer
If we took some time further apart

Didn't it make you better?
Aren't we better now?
I know it made me better
Aren't we better now?

But w better run up to the club once or twice
Breaking up in the middle of the night
No right, somehow we fixed that
Better at talking than we used to fight
Still bail me out when my money ain't right
Oh my
All the things that I had to eat, baby
Start your fight, I could've waited all day or night
Could've been forever
Told you that I needed time to wait
But there's a lot to think about
while you wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Tell me one more time

Didn't it make you better?
Aren't we better now?
I know it made me better
Aren't we better now?

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
