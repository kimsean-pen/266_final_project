Guildford, Guildford holy mother of
Helen, Jesus in the architraves
Waiting, waiting, comes to take all my misery away, at least for now
Kelvin get a holy vigor we can work it out

It must be 5 years ago now
Skulking home one public holiday
Eighteen, eighteen, baby brains
Got the nervous twitching algorithms right beneath the cheese
Yeah, half expecting knuckles now to bring me to my knees

If she wants this to be
She'll have to see the things I have had to see
Maybe she would know
Maybe she would care
She only loves me when i'm there

It must be five years ago now
My trimester public holiday
Eighteen crack these oysters open
She can be forgiven but she doesn't go away
Yeah, see her on the bus, man, see her everyday

If she wants this to be
She'll have to see the things that I have had to see
And maybe she would know
Maybe she would care
She only loves me when i'm there

I don't want to live like this anymore, kid
I don't want to live like this anymore

She only loves me when I'm there
She only loves me when I'm there

Nervous stitching algorithms right beneath the trees
Yeah half expecting knuckles now to bring me to my knees
