Is this the end of the beginning?
Or the beginning of the end?
Losing control or are you winning?
Is your life real or just pretend?

Reanimation of the sequence
Rewind the future to the past.
To find the source of the solution;
The system has to be recast.

Release your mind.
Fast forward to the secrets of your code.
Your life's on overload.
Delete or save

The units that make you an entity
That's your identity
If you don't know
Which way to go

You may be lost and confused
A second chance your turn to lose

Regeneration of your cyber sonic soul.
Transforming time and space beyond control;
Rise up resist and be the master of your fate.
Don't look back live for today - tomorrow is too late.

You don't want to be a robot ghost
Occupied inside a human host
Analyzed and cloned relentlessly
Synthesized until they set you free.

Alright-okay alright till they set you free...
Alright-okay till they set you freeeee!!
I don't want to see you yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't want to see you yeah, yeah, yeah
