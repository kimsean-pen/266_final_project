Burning, everything is burning
Memories are melting
The flames are running wild
They're singing to the ashes
Erasing all the edges
Burning down the walls I've built
For so long

Left alone with all these toxins
Inside the place I learned to walk in
My blood is losing oxygen

And I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't see
Through the smoke
It's gonna swallow me
And I can't breathe
Rescue me
On my knees
I use all my tears
To wash me clean
And I don't have enough
I don't have enough
To stop this fire

Slowly, heaven's close to me
And everything's unholy
Is that when ashes turn to beauty
'Cause I'm empty
Just like this around me
The flames are taking everything
Except the fire within me

Left alone with all these toxins
Inside the place I learned to walk in
My blood is losing oxygen

I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't see
Through the smoke
It's gonna swallow me
And I can't breathe
Rescue me
On my knees
I use all my tears
To wash me clean
And I don't have enough
I don't have enough
I don't have enough
To stop this fire

But I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't see
I can't breathe
Rescue me
I'm on my knees
I can't breathe
I don't have enough
