Bring it all back now

Don't stop, never give up
Hold your head high and reach the top
Let the world see what you have got
Bring it all back to you (Bring it all back now)

Hold on to what you try to be, your individuality
When the world is on your shoulders, just smile and let it go
If people try to put you down, just walk on by, don't turn around
You only have to answer to yourself

Don't you know it's true what they say?
In life, it ain't easy
But your time's coming around
So don't you stop trying

Don't stop, never give up
Hold your head high and reach the top
Let the world see what you have got
Bring it all back to you (Bring it all back now)

Dream of falling in love
Anything you've been thinking of
When the world seems to get too tough
Bring it all back to you (Bring it all back now)
Yeah, yeah

Na na na na na na...
Bring it back
Bring it back
(Bring it all back now)

Try not to worry 'bout a thing
Enjoy the good times love can bring
Don't keep it all inside you
Gotta let the feelings show

Imagination is the key
'Cause you are your own destiny
You never should be lonely
When time is on your side

Don't you know it's true what they say?
Things are sent to try you
But your time's coming around
So don't you stop trying

Don't stop, never give up
Hold your head high and reach the top
Let the world see what you have got
Bring it all back to you (Bring it all back now)

Dream of falling in love
Anything you've been thinking of

Na na na na na na...
Bring it all, bring it all back now
Na na na...
Bring it all back to me, baby

Don't you know it's true what they say?
Things happen for a reason
But your time's coming around
So don't stop trying

Don't stop, never give up
Hold your head high and reach the top
Let the world see what you have got
Bring it all back to you (Bring it all back now)
