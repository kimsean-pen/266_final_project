You make me stand in a pool of sweat,
While I own up to my only regret,
There were times when you wouldn't pay it much mind,
But now you swing me for every line.

Until I overhead you think of me,
As a dead end with an undying need,
I'm done with begging on my aching knee,
I'm sure you'll find another with no reason to be.

Here's to the endless love,
That ties me infinitely,
Here's to the endless love,
That ties me in.

I have a bubble,
I can't get in,
So I shield myself using anything,
I'm done with standing outside of this thing,
How long is it gonna take for you to let me in?

Here's to the endless love,
That ties me infinitely,
Here's to the endless love,
That ties me infinitely.

Here's to the endless love,
That ties me infinitely,
Here's to the endless love,
That ties me.

But if the dead end never stops,
I don't know,
No, I don't.
