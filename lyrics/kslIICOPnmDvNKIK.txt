This is an end, so now I'm starting again to return form

I never found peace, but now im fighting a war
All the vicious and greedy left me blind and confused
My illusions so grand but my reality skewed

I tried to be what they wanted, a hollowed cut puppet
Lying to myself to carry on like i loved it
They use my effort to feed
They sleep while i bleed

I've caught every vulture
I've clipped every wing
I've caught every vulture
Starve, you wont feed on these dreams again

This is an end, so now im starting again to return form
I never found peace,
But now I'm fighting a war
All the vicious and greedy
Their collapse was deserved
With delusions so grand
This is what they have earned
