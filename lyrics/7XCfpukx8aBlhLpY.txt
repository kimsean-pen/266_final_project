Running in the darkness, rolling back in time
Following the voices howling in your mind
Under you the frozen lake crackles 'til you halt
When the frosty mirror breaks, will you hear the call?

Come admit your secret plan to make it to the top
Hear the sirens as they sing 'til the day you drop

Fall through the ice into my eyes
Islands of light guide you tonight

Drowning in your daydreams, hiding in your bed
They keep on complaining, it's all in your head
Come admit your secret plan to make it to the top
Hear the sirens as they sing 'til the day you drop

Fall through the ice into my eyes
Islands of light guide you tonight
Fall through the ice into my eyes
Islands of light guide you tonight

Don't you recognize your voice in our coven's song?
Don't you know it's not the music you had danced along?
See the moon riding the tide, the reflection swims
As the ice begins to melt, we see a form within

Fall through the ice into my eyes
Islands of light guide you tonight
Fall through the ice into my eyes
Islands of light guide you tonight
