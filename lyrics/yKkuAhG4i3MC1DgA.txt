So you'll try to tell me not to overthink
While I disregard the fact you share his sheets
And now I live in black and gray
'Cause my color ran away
With the one you better hope I never meet

You suck the life out of the room
I'm hard to love, but so are you
So quick to kill my heart and
I thought that I needed one hit so I feel it
I'm sick of nights I know I'll lose
I'm hard to love, but so are you

And I won't forget the way you look at me
I didn't notice that my eyes begin to fade
And I bet he feels the same
Take the color from my pain
While you siphon everything he'll ever be

You suck the life out of the room
I'm hard to love, but so are you
So quick to kill my heart and
I thought that I needed one hit so I feel it
I'm sick of nights I know I'll lose
I'm hard to love, but so are you

Is it the way he says he loves you?
'Cause I used to say that shit too
Is it the way he says he loves you?
'Cause I used to say that shit too

You suck the life out of the room
I'm hard to love, but so are you
So quick to kill my heart and
I thought that I needed one hit so I feel it
I'm sick of nights I know I'll lose
I'm hard to love, but so are you

So quick to kill my heart and
I thought that I needed one hit so I feel it
I'm sick of nights I know I'll lose
I'm hard to love, but so are you
