Ooh baby
Ooh baby
Bereaved lady
Ooh... baby

Ooh... baby
Ooh... baby
Cut you like a stone
And left your side
Scarred
Scarred

Ooh... baby
Slow, steady
Heaven's waiting
Ahh... ooh... baby

Ooh... lady
Ooh... lady
You took your soul
And left you out to dry
Scarred

Now, won't through your last
And the cracking way the howlers got your back
Scarred
Whoo.ohh it's scarred

Ahh... lady
Ahh... lady
Love, baby
Your... they only cry

Ooh... baby
Scarred
Whoo... ohh, it's scarred
