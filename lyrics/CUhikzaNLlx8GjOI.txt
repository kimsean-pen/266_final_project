a vision comes true
a dead man that returns
a mythic horse pronounces him
as an emperor returned

followed by black moves
contrast the white horse
aliens' dark motives
the army of the beloved

thousand waves swallow him
dance under the grey skin
shades get life and follow him

archon - the shadows call
archon - the planets call
the echoes in the other world
"emeron, i'm over all"

the chapter goes right
the prophecy will be done
time signed the last king
who's buried under ice
