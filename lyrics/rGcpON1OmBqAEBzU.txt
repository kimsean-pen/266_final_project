Stuck in the middle of a war zone
I feel your cry
Knee-deep, I hear the
Sound lighting up the sky
Shelling, the cowards let it rain
From a tag on the wall
The violent colorasian on the
Faces of the youth, enraged them all

Lies feeding lies, we are the rebels
Lies feeding lies, we are the rebels

Dying, hit the ground
Hiding, face first down
Are we too far from no return?
Dying, hit the ground
Hiding, face first down
Where's the path to sovereignty?

نحن لسنا العدو. نحن نريد السلام

Turned to ashes
Our paradise reduced to dust
We are not the ones to fear
Misunderstood in sadness
Painted blood-red stains
We breathe the same and
We bleed the same

Dying, hiding
Are we too far from no return?
Dying, hit the ground
Hiding, face first down
Where's the path to sovereignty?
