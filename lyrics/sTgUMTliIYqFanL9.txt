i've put on the shiniest smile for her
just vibrations for her smell, pure
and tender
i'v eput on the biggest smile for her
hands
but she won't ever grow
i've put on the sweetest smile for
her
pleasepay attention to your heart

i'veput on the catchy smile for her
legs
and please leave me alone
i saw your breath, and then you
tried, to smother me
how can you like an old man, so
leave me and trust me
