Attention! Attention!
All citizens are ordered to report to their district detention centers
Do not return to your homes
Do not contact anyone
Do not use any cellular or GPS devices
Surrender all weapons at once
Attention! This way to the camps

I woke up in a black FEMA box
Darkness was all around me, in my coffin
My dreams are all nightmares anymore
And this is what I dream every night

The Leader of the New World Order
The President of the United States
Has declared anyone now residing
Inside the US of A
Without the RFID chip
You're just an illegal alien
An enemy combatant of America
Welcome to the New World Order

This is the end of the road
This is the end of the line
This is the end of your life
This is the

A society in a society
Inside the fence life as you know it stops
They got their rules of conduct and we got ours
Be quick or be dead, you crumble up and die
The clock is ticking so slowly
And so much can happen in an hour

This is the end of the road
This is the end of the line
This is the end of your life
This is the endgame

I learned my lessons the hard way
Every scar I earned, I had to bleed
Inside the day yard
A system of controlled movement
Like a giant ant farm
Any time is long time, now you're not in charge of your time anymore

This is the end of the road
This is the end of the line
This is the end of your life
This is the end

The Ex-President signed a secret bill
That can land a legal US Citizen in jail
And the Patriot act stripped away our constitutional rights
They say a Concentration camp just popped up, yeah, right!

Refuse the chip? Ha, get persecute and beat
By the tyranny of mind control for the mark of the beast
All rights removed, you're punished, captured, and enslaved
Believe me when I say, "This is the endgame!"
