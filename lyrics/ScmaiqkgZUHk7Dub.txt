I'm on my way, I'm making it
I've got to make it show, yeah
yeah

It' so much larger than life
I'm gonna watch it growing

The place where I come from
Is a small town
They think so small
They use small words

But not me
I'm smarter than that
I worked it out
I've been stretching my mouth
to let those big words come right out

I had enough
I'm getting out
To the city
The big, big city
I'll be your big noise
With all the big boys
(So much stuff I will own)

And I will pray to a big god
as I kneel in the big church
(Big Time)
I'm on my way, I'm making it
(Big Time)
Uhh, yes
(Big Time)
I've got to make it show, yeah
(Big Time)
(Big Time)
It's so much larger than life
(Big Time)
I'm gonna watch it growing
(Big Time)

My parties have all the big names
And I greet them with the widest smile
Tell them how my life
Is one big adventure
And always there amazed

And I showed them round my house to my bed
I had it made like a mountain range
With snow white pillows for my big fat head
And our heaven will be a big heaven
And I will walk through the front door

(Big Time)
I'm on my way, I'm making it
(Big Time)
(Big Time)
I've got to make it show, yeah
(Big Time)
(Big Time)
It' so much larger than life
(Big Time)
I'm gonna watch it growing
(Big Time)
(Big Time)
My cars gettin' bigger
(Big Time)
My house gettin' bigger
(Big Time)
My eyes gettin' bigger
(Big Time)
And my mouth
(Big Time)
My bed's gettin' bigger
(Big Time)
And my bank account
(Big Time)
Look at my circumstance
(Big Time)
And I ... your not big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big...
