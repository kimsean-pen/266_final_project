(I know what buttons to push to turn a man on)
Yeah

I can make you blush
I can make you sweat
Make you come over all possessive
Like I'm your angel to protect
Make your heart beat at 134 beats a minute
Think your life's empty without me in it
But what you don't know won't hurt you
So I keep it to myself that I'm crazy about you

"Treat them mean to keep them keen"
An expression a hard lesson that I had to learn
Cos when I give my heart too easily
That's when I get burned

I know what buttons to push to turn a man on
Doesn't mean I'm gonna push 'em with you that would be wrong
Gonna strip away my make up, what you get is what you see
No Trix, No Games just me

I can make you beg (yeah)
Make you lose your breath
I can get you feelin' all embarrassed
Like you're standin' there undressed
When I turn it on I can be magnetic
Then make you think that you're not gonna get it
Pull your strings make you do anything
With you never knowing that I'm crazy about you

"Treat them mean to keep them keen"
An expression a hard lesson that I had to learn
Cos when I give my heart too easily
That's when I get burned

I know what buttons to push to turn a man on (to turn a man on)
Doesn't mean I'm gonna push 'em with you that would be wrong
Gonna strip away my make up, what you get is what you see (see)
No Trix, No Games just me (just me)

Behind the smoke and mirrors there's a girl you never see
(No Trix, No Games, no illusions, no fantasy)
And I want you to know her cos she's the real me
(No Trix, No Games that's the way it's got to be)
That's the way it's gotta be, yeah

I know what buttons to push to turn a man on
(To push to turn a man on)
Doesn't mean I'm gonna push 'em with you that would be wrong
(That would be wrong, yeah)
Gonna strip away my make up, what you get is what you see
(What you see is what you're gonna get)
No Trix, No Games, just me (No Trix, No Games, just me)

I know what buttons to push to turn a man on
(To push to turn a man on)
Doesn't mean I'm gonna push 'em with you that would be wrong
(That would be wrong)
Gonna strip away my make up, what you get is what you see
(What you get, is what you see)
No trix (no trix!)
No games (no games!)
Just me
