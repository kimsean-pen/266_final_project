Blame it on love, what else could it be?
Causing all this misery
Blame it on love, so easy to do
No one does it more than you

And you make my heart break when you take and you take
Take from it
Yes, you take all my love, all my love
And make hate, hate from it

There's a place in my heart
That's got your name on it, on it
Sitting there like a scar
Forever engraved on it

Blame it on us, too young to know
That memories stay when lovers go
Blame it on lust, too easy for you
No one does it like you do

And you make my heart break when you take and you take
Take from it
Yes, you take all my love, all my love
And make hate, hate from it

There's a place in my heart
That's got your name on it, on it
Sitting there like a scar
Forever engraved on it

Blame it on love
Blame it on love
Blame it on love
Blame it on love

Blame it on love, what else could it be?
Causing all this misery
Blame it on love, so easy to do
No one does it more than you

There's a place in my heart
That's got your name on it, on it
Sitting there like a scar
Forever engraved on it
