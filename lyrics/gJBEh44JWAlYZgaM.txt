Can you face it?
Can you embrace it?
You can't replace (no)
The time you've wasted
This panorama, Portland to Alabama
The ground you're standing
To protect your your family

Double down when your back's against the wall
You double down when you hear the dealer call
You've got your Good Book all wrong
You wanna do God's work
It's gonna be hard work
You've got your Good Book all wrong
You wanna do God's work
It's gonna be hard work

I put my faith in only things that i can see
And trust my eyes aren't playing tricks on me
(Down in the desert) Outside the Mandalay
(I've been praying) It didn't change a thing

Double down when your back's against the wall
You double down when you hear the dealer call
You've got your Good Book all wrong
You wanna do God's work
It's gonna be hard work
You've got your Good Book all wrong
You wanna do God's work
It's gonna be hard work

You keep repeating that wicked catchphrase
Painted on the Interstate
Then all peoples,
They get so lonely
I cant sleel off these American screams tonight
You've got your Good Book all wrong
You wanna do God's work
It's gonna be hard work
You've got your Good Book all wrong
You wanna do God's work
It's gonna be hard work
You wanna do God's work
It's gonna be hard work
You wanna do God's work
It's gonna be hard work
