King ink strolls into town
He sniffs around

King ink kicks off his stink-boot
Sand and soot and dust and dirt and
He's much bigger than you think
King ink
King ink
King ink
A wake up a king ink a get up a king ink a wake up a king ink
A get up a get up a get up a get up a get up
Up up up up up up up up up up...

A bug crawls up the wall

King ink feels like a bug
And he hates his rotten shell
(he says) cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha...
King ink a wake up a king ink a get up a king ink a wake up a king ink
A get up a get up a get up a get up a get up
A what's in that room? a what's in that house?
A what's in that room? a what's in that house?
Say something, express thyself, say something, express yourself
Express... say something loudly aaaaaahhhh...
A what's in that room? a what's in that house?
Sand and soot and dust and dirt and sand and soot and dust and dirt
And-d-d-d-d-d-d-
Di-di-di-di-di-di-di di-di-di-di-di-di dirt

King ink feels like a bug
Swimming in a soup-bowl
He says oh! yer! oh! yer! what a wonderful life
Oh! yer! oh! yer! what a wonderful life
Oh! yer! oh! yer! what a wonderful life
Oh! yer! oh! yer! what a wonderful life
Oh! yer! oh! yer! fats domino on the radio
Yer! oh! yer! what a wonderful life
Oh! yer! oh! yer! what a wonderful life
Oh! yer! oh! yer! fats domino on the radio
Yer! oh! yer!
