Along she came with her picture
Put it in a frame so I won't miss her
Got on a plane, from out of Heathrow
Seems such a shame, yeah

I feel her slipping through my fingers
Now she's gone I'm sleeping with the light on
And shocks went through my veins now that she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on

Heard she's engaged, but to her best friend
No-one's to blame, here's where it all ends
And I feel the pain, 'cause I'm without her
I feel the pain

I feel her slipping through my fingers
Now she's gone I'm sleeping with the light on
And shocks went through my veins now that she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on

She decides with a different life
Words cannot describe the way I'm feeling
'Cause I been searching in my head
For the words I thought she said
For too long

I feel her slipping through my fingers
Now she's gone I'm sleeping with the light on
And shocks went through my veins now that she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on

I feel her slipping through my fingers
Now she's gone I'm sleeping with the light on
And shocks went through my veins now that she's gone
Now she's gone, yeah, yeah.
