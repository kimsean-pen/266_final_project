Tell me
How many times
Can we start again
How many twisted turns
To lose a friend
I know it's taken long
For me to change my tune
You've said that it's too late
But it's still too soon

I play like broken records do
Le coeur a trente-trois tours
The songs keep skipping back to you
En tout et partout

You fell for it I fell for you
Mon coeur craquera toujours
I brushed you off
That scratched it too
En tout et partout

You can fall too hard
I'd fall to pieces now
If our shattered hopes
Cut you somehow

You skip the part where I care
What love has done to you
Since I don't go there
Why am I hearing it too?

I play like broken records do
Le coeur a trente-trois tours
The songs keep skipping back to you
En tout et partout

On s'entendait Ã  en devenir sourds
Hearts break when they can't break through
On s'entendait
Je t'entends toujours
En tout et partout

And maybe I've been blind
But seeing others
Takes a little time
When they can see right through you

Maybe I've been weak
But all my memories of you don't shine
They speak to me

En tout
T'es partout
