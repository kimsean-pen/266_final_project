Oh, ooh, ooh, oh
Trill got the juice, nigga
Salute
Ayy, I'm in this motherfuckin' four, four by four cell
Man, I just runnin' around hittin' licks
Lookin' in mirrors and shit

No Christmases, no Thanksgiving, this shit here get sad
No 4th of July, man, I swear your ass'll be mad
Just thinkin' 'bout what you need to do
And turnin' up with your gang
And how you miss 'em and they miss you too
But you cannot hang
Don't talk about them holidays, no holidays
I was locked up for them holidays, no holidays
No holidays, hey
No holidays, no holidays
Imagine bein' locked up for all of your holidays

Bitch, it's Thanksgiving, wait, damn, bruh, it's Christmas?
I woke up in the same damn mat, and this food ain't delicious
I knew if I was out though, my dawg's mama'd be whippin'
She'd be cookin' that good food, all in that kitchen
Bitch, I'm in the can (Ayy, uh)
Lookin' in the mirror like wait, find yourself
Man, you really need to find yourself
Don't need to depend on no one else
And they tryna tell me line up for lunch
I don't wanna eat that shit right
There, that shit ain't really brunch (Uh-uh)
They puttin' other shit in that food, oh, damn you
Don't let them crackers lock you up and then program you

The government is really dirty, ayy
They lockin' all of them young niggas who thuggin'
In the trenches
Front with them 30s, huh
But them niggas just gotta get it
'Cause that's how they're livin' and that's how it goes, huh
Them niggas just tryna get it
They tryna get money, don't fuck on these hoes

No Christmases, no Thanksgiving, this shit here get sad
No 4th of July, man, I swear your ass'll be mad
Just thinkin' 'bout what you need to do
And turnin' up with your gang
And how you miss 'em and they miss you too
But you cannot hang
Don't talk about them holidays, no holidays
I was locked up for them holidays, no holidays
No holidays, hey
No holidays, no holidays
Imagine bein' locked up for all of your holidays

This turkey dry as fuck, don't wanna eat it (Don't eat it, ayy)
No pussy in this cell, I had to beat it (Had to masturbate)
I'm in the science classroom learnin' 'bout a fetus ('Bout a baby)
Spray Gildan Bob Barker, no Adidas (No Adidas on)
My young niggas still out there
With them heaters (With them 40 Glocks)
No Juvy, still out here trainin'
Them eaters (Trainin' them ratchet hoes)
Can't sleep at night, can't sleep at night
Can't sleep at night, oh no, no, no
They don't wanna see a nigga make it out this cell
I can see it in their eyes (Yeah)
Are you surprised? (Are you surprised?)
That we made it this far? (We made it this far?)
They don't wanna see you make it (Wanna see you make it)
But they know that you a star
Told you, man, lil' baby want get faded
You can be Freddy, fuck nigga, I'm Jason
All these ratchet young niggas chasin'
Say he got a feelin', lil' nigga, better face it, yeah, yeah
They don't make guns in jail
You better learn how to take the L
I pray to God I prevail, fuck it, the judge wish me well
Ain't no holidays when you in that cell
It ain't no holiday that can save you

No Christmases, no Thanksgiving, this shit here get sad
No 4th of July, man, I swear your ass'll be mad
Just thinkin' 'bout what you need to do
And turnin' up with your gang
And how you miss 'em and they miss you too
But you cannot hang
Don't talk about them holidays, no holidays
I was locked up for them holidays, no holidays
No holidays, hey
No holidays, no holidays
Imagine bein' locked up for all of your holidays
