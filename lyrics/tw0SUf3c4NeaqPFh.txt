You say you're in love
the curse has wrote
this sonnet to the end
You say you're in love
this hostile can't pretend
everything trashed
and picture ask for something
so perfectly aligned
will you come to me?
will you come to me?

Kiss me, quick I'm losing
Why can't we live forever?

You say you're in love
But beauty slides
This silhouette, she screams
Will you come to me?
Will you come to me?

Kiss me, quick I'm losing
Why can't we live forever?
Kiss me, quick I'm losing
But I'm missing this kiss

She will love you
For all her life (all her life)
She will love you
Throughout the skies
She will love you
For all her life (all her life)
And sing our lies forever
Sing our lies together

Can you take me back so far away
Can you take me back so far away
There's something left...
There's something left to say
There's something left...
You've got something left to say

She will love you
For all her life (all her life)
She will love you
Throughout the skies
She will love you
For all her life (all her life)
And sing our lies forever
Sing our lies together
