Got a girl from the Southside
Got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by
Man I 'Bout fell up out my chair

Had to get her number
Took me like 6 weeks
Now me and her go way back
Like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road
Could drive it with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty
I ain't in no hurry
I'm a take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans
She don't need no belt
But I can turn 'em inside out
I don't need no help

Got hips like honey
So thick and so sweet
Ain't no curves like hers
On them downtown streets

Body like a back road
Could drive it with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty
I ain't in no hurry
I'm a take it slow just as fast as I can

We're out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers

On a highway to Heaven
Headed south of her smile
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile

Body like a back road
Could drive it with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty
I ain't in no hurry
I'm a take it slow just as fast as I can

I'm take it slow just as fast I can

Got the breeze, aah ha

(Body like a back road
Could drive it with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand)
