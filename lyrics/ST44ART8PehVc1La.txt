If you lead a lonely, lonely life
You get to be aware
And if you've been constantly asking why
You get to be aware

'Cause you got nothing to say
God knows you got nothing to say
I'm on the phone for much too long
Got happiness today

If you got an all-consuming need
You get to be aware
And if you got heart or lung disease
You get to be aware

'Cause you got bills to pay,
God knows you got bills to pay,
Pick up the phone, the telephone,
Got happiness today

You wanna live a laughter
You gotta be aware

I got a thousand answers, one's gotta be right
Give me a thousand chances and I'll get it right

And if you're fed up with all the lies
You get to be aware
Then I'll give you all the whens and whys
You get to be be aware

'Cause you got nothing to say
God knows you got nothing to say
I'm on the phone, but not too long...
Got happiness today

You wanna live a laughter
You gotta be aware

I got a thousand answers, one's gotta be right
Give me a thousand chances and I'll get it right
I got a thousand answers, one's gotta be right
Give me a thousand chances and I'll get it right

I got a thousand answers, one's gotta be right
I got a million answers, one's gotta be right
Got a gazillion answers, one's gotta be right
