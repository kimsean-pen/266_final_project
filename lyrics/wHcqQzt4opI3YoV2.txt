It's so hard not begging you to stay
'Till all the snow melts away
One more hour one more day
It's hard not begging you to stay

Maa Oh Aa
Maa Oh Aa

It's so hard not asking you to wait
For one more rainy day
And when it almost washed away
To beg again that you remain
It's hard not begging you to stay

It's too early to wash off his cologne
It's too early to give up on whispering his name
It's too early to wash off his cologne
It's too early to give up on whispering his name

Maa Oh Aa
Maa Oh Aa
Maa Oh Aa
Maa Oh Aa

It's too early to wash off his cologne
It's too early to give up on whispering his name
It's too early to wash off his cologne
It's too early to give up on whispering his name
