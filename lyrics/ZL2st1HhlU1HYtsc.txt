In the first of light
past the Noachide
bodies wrapped in white

Stranded every pain
baby, pasts are slain
I got outta La Grange?

In Hinnom
All this time
with your heart in mind

didn't you edit

In Hinnom
Go, the least
and the precious feast

the in-vetted

Sand it starts to steal
dirt and ice imbed in cheeks
in the potter's field

Solar peace
well it swirls and sweeps
you just set it
Strangers scattering
nether passage in the wind
off pennant tension ring
Armor, down
on the wettest ground
not to vet it
