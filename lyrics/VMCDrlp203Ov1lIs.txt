A diminutive figure in a filthy loin cloth
Is en route to your house just to knock you off

A sad pygmy who takes small steps
Who weeps while he snuffs you
Who sits on your chest
The art of self-defense

He weeps while he snuffs you
He sits on your chest
To him you're no different from all the rest
A sad, sad, sad, sad, sad pygmy
