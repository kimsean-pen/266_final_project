Hello money, hello bank
Buy me shelter, be my friend
I will borrow, you will lend
I need a finger, but I want a hand

Build that, buy that
Build that, buy that

Would you be my church, save my soul
To all this stuff I won't say no

It's all too hard to say no
It's all too hard to let go

Bye bye money, hello bank
You will borrow, and I will lend
My green tongue will lick your wounds
Colour me red, colour me red dead

Build that, buy that
Build that, buy that

Build that prison, on that cloud
I wait for you to bail me out

It's all too hard to say no
It's all too hard to let go

Build that, buy that
Build that, buy that
