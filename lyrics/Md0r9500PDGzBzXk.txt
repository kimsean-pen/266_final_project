The only ones who understand it is real mothafuckas
Bitch, bitch, bitch

You mothafuckin' doin' it by, you know in situations and what's happenin'
You feel me? That nigga
Bitch!

Late night I'm prolly moving lowkey
You think that I'm dolo, it's ten niggas with me (Ho)
Keep one to the hip, none of those magazines (Bitch)
Make niggas dip like Tom Hanks in movies (Run)
I been feelin' lazy, smokin' too much O.G (G)
Sheck Wes going through some things, I'm smokin' O.D (Bitch)
Now Sheck West in the V.I.P, last year runnin' from police
If I made it here, then I'm the M.V.P (Bitch! Bitch!)

These hoes say young Sheck Wes hotter than AZ
N-I-K-Es all on my feet, fuck you, pay me
That's what a nigga breathes (Bitch)
Can't shit faze me (Bitch)
You niggas watchin' me, I watch the throne like Jay-Z
I still ain't take an L 'til a nigga spray me
If you got some shit to say, then say that shit to me
Listen to the kids, stop bein' hard-headed
It get tragic where I live, Sheck Wes two times, I said it
But these niggas ain't listen and shit I don't regret it
'Cause shit gotta happen for me to learn these lessons
Put my thoughts in my pen and bullets in my weapon
And I pray and say amen anytime a nigga stressin'
But my mind my greatest weapon 'cause
Fuck people with, nigga, it's your mothafuckin' mind
You fuck everything but your mind, nigga
You're a mothafuckin' mindfucker

Mudboy, bitch
