Whatever happened to a blue sky day?
Planes overhead sprayin'
All my blue sky day away
Sprayin' out the sun,
Milkin' out the sky
Aerosols at altitude,
At atmospheric heights
Jet planes making chemtrails,
Making gridlines in' the skies
Street graffiti not allowed, but vandalize...
Stratospheric skies

Whatever happened to a blue sky day?
Planes overhead sprayin'
All my blue sky day away
Sprayin' out the sun,
Milkin' out the sky
Aerosols at altitude,
At atmospheric heights
Jet planes making chemtrails,
Geo-engineerin' of the skies
Street graffiti not allowed, but vandalize...
Stratospheric skies

You think I'm crazy, would you rather I don't say
Shall we pretend that it ain't happenin',
And it'll all just go away
Jet planes making chemtrails,
Making dawn raids in the sky
Lines are spread like spiders' webs
And that's makin' all of us...
All of us the flies

Right in front of your eyes
Right there in the skies
Right there in your eyes
Right there in the skies

You think I'm crazy,
Would you rather I don't say
Shall we pretend that it ain't
Happenin' and it'll all ΅΅just go away
Jetplanes making chemtrails,
Criss-crossings in the skies
Street graffiti not allowed,
But vandalize...
Stratospheric skies

Right in front of your eyes
Right there in the skies
Right there in your eyes
Right there in the skies

The few that rule the many,
Yeah yeah we all got eyes to see
Some that just don't realise,
The rich man's trickery
It's the few that rule the many,
We all got eyes to see
Some that just don't realise,
The rich man's...
Plants, traps and trickery

Woke up this mornin' to a blue sky day
Planes overhead sprayin'
All my blue sky day away
Children, ask your daddy,
Tell your mummy look to the skies
Where have all the
Blues skies gone, all hidden
In plain sight
