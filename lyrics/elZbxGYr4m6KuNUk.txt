Take me anywhere you go
I've got nothin' here but me, babe
Take me with you when you go

I got a feelin' my minds in the sky
And I can't catch a breath
Or a break like a guy who's stranglin' babe
For help, not attention
And then, not to mention, the dame that was mine
And I thought and I know
And that what's goin' on in my eyes
And my hands could be robbin' without any knowledge
I know that helpin' yourself could be hurtin' or harmin' someone
