Sweet Young Girl So Soft and Blonde
Does Exactly What She's Been Warned
Intoxication's in Her Veins
Sweet Young Boy Plays With Her Brain
Believing All His Faith-Filled Lies
Putting His Hands onto Her Thighs
Impurity Has Now Been Gripped
He Takes Away Her Innocence

Sweet Children, Sweet Children, Sweet Children
Remember When?

Johnny Ray Is Running Again, as He Hit the Floor Again
Running from the Light of Day, or Maybe Lie and Celebrate
The Slightest Urge Goes from His Hands
Follow Me if You Understand
He's Got the Trigger on His Gun
Final Sin and Now He Runs

Sweet Children, Sweet Children, Sweet Children
Remember When?

Sweet Children, Sweet Children, Sweet Children
Will Never Win.
