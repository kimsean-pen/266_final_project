Was it something unsaid?
It's getting cold out
Well I'm nervous 'til I find your face
Anywhere I go
Aim it gets physical

Was it something undid?
I'm taking four hours
But I'll never fall out of fate
Everywhere I go
Aim it gets physical

Oh, I'm in need, dependent
I will wait up for the call me out
I will warn everyone out there
Honestly you wanna find me
Tell me what you need and I see you get by
I was wrong
I hurt you
Pick me, pick me, and I'm still in love with life
Lay it on, I hurt you

Was it something I said?
Fade away the hours
Though I never thought I'd love it
Everywhere I go
It gets physical

Was it something I did?
It's getting cold out
But I'll never fall out of fate
Everywhere I go
It gets physical

Oh, I'm an independent
I won't wait up for the call me out
I won't warn anyone out there
Honestly you wanna find me
Tell me what you feel cause I need to get by
I was wrong
I hurt you
Pick me, pick me, and I'm still in love with life
Lay it on, I hurt you

Tell me what you see and the fear you get by
I was wrong
I hurt you
Pick me, pick me, and I'm still in love with life
Lay it on, I hurt you
