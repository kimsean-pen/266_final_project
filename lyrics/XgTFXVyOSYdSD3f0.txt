Love like a storm, like an ocean, endless
Love like a fire, like the world is burning

Should've known better
Should've known better
But you see through all the lines and then
Prove I'm not like all of them
Should've known better
Should've known better
Oooh, aaah

If your love is just a dream, don't wake me up
It's hard enough to face to world alone
If your love is just a dream, don't wake me up
It's hard enough to face the world alone

You are the one I waited for, I knew it all along (knew it all along)
You are the one I'm fighting for, I knew it all along

Love like a dream, like you're never waking
Love like your last, like the sky is falling

Should've known better
Should've known better
But you see through all lines and then
Prove I'm not like all of them
Should've known better
Should've known better
Oooh, aaah

You are the one I waited for, I knew it all along (knew it all along)
You are the one I'm fighting for, I knew it all along

Sing me something that'll bring me to my knees
That'll put my mind at ease
Please tell me anything
We can build this like a dream
Let's make believe just you and me

If your love is like a dream, don't wake me up
It's hard enough to face the world alone
If this love is just a dream, don't wake me up
It's hard enough to face the world alone
If your heart stops beating, god rest my soul
Dig this grave for two, can't live without you
It's hard enough to face the world alone
If your heart stops beating, god rest my soul
Dig this grave for two, can't live without you
It's hard enough to face the world alone
You are the one I waited for, I knew it all along
