Take a little sip
Have a little trip but don't you know we're going nowhere
But I'm feeling like I feel alright
Don't you let it slip, don't you lose your grip
Don't let us vanish into thin air
Because we feeling like, I feel alright

And we're gonna break and wake this tide

Remember 21, when the night felt younger
When we danced into our daydreams
You had me feeling like, I feel alright
While it feels insane no way you know you're going nowhere
We should be feeling like, I feel alright

And we're gonna break and wake this tide

And we're gonna break and wake this tide
