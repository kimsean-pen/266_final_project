I had a dream last night
What a lovely dream it was
I dreamed we all were alright
Happy in a land of oz
Why did everybody laugh when I told them my dream?
I guess they all were so far from that kind of that scene
Feelin real mean

I heard a song last night
What a lovely song it was
I thought I'd hum it all night
Unforgettable because.

All of the players were playing together
And all of the heavies were as light as a feather
See, your love remember is a freeing of soul
But as I recall, the rest will just follow

I had a dream last night
What a lovely dream it was
I dreamed we all were alright
Happy in a land of oz
What a lovely dream it was
What a lovely dream it was

What a lovely dream it was
