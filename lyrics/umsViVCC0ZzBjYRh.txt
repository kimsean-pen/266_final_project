Last flare from the lifeboat
Last air in my lungs
By now even I know
That you've got someone
Some people see the diamond
Some can only see the flaws
We made perfect little movies
That no one ever saw

I didn't know that forever only meant forever til
you found someone better (someone better than me)
Some day its gonna hit you
You'll see it clear as crystal like a photograph

No one else gonna love you like that
No one else gonna love you like that
I'll stay in your mind, you can always find me in the way way back
No one else gonna love you like that
Gonna love you like that

Gonna love you like that

I'm sure he's easier than I was
If you like that sorta thing
He looks better with his shirt off
Yeah, but can he sing
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Winter sun setting early
And my shadow's getting long
Radio just want to hurt me
Puts you in every song

No one else gonna love you like that
No one else gonna love you like that
I'll stay in your mind, you can always find me in the way way back
No one else gonna love you like that
Gonna love you like that

Gonna love you like that

I didn't know that forever only
meant forever til you found someone better
(someone better than me)
Some day its gonna hit you
You'll see it clear as crystal like a photograph

No one else gonna love you like that
No one else gonna love you like that

No one else gonna love you like that
No one else gonna love you like that

I'll stay in your mind, you can always find me in the way way back
No one else gonna love you like that
Gonna love you like that

Gonna love you like that
