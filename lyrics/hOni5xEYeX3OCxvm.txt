Another day spent wasted, another year passed me by.
Listening to old sad songs to get me through the night.
Staring at the walls, wondering where I went wrong.
My last light just burned out and I'm left with the darkness again.

But still, I can't seem to find importance in anything.
I'm still waiting for the day when I'll fit into my own skin.
Now I'm even struggling to connect with my own friends.
Until I make a change, the weight I carry will just soak in.

I'm getting old, my life's been wasted.
Another bottle to my mouth, the days aren't changing.
I'm getting old, my life's been wasted.
Another bottle to my mouth, it echoes and bleeds out.

I'm fed up of drowning in my own self-pity.
Tired, I'm useless, fragile and worthless.
Am I slowly drowning? I keep telling myself I am.
Am I slowly drowning? I keep telling myself I am.

Another day spent wasted, another year passed me by.
Listening to old sad songs to get me through the night.
Staring at the walls, wondering where I went wrong.
My last light just burned out, it's just me in the darkness again.

It's just me in the darkness again.

It echoes and bleeds out.
It surrounds me.
It echoes and bleeds out.
And holds me down.
It echoes and bleeds out.
It surrounds me.
It echoes and bleeds out.

I'm getting old, my life's been wasted.
Another bottle to my mouth, the days aren't changing.
I'm getting old, my life's been wasted.
Another bottle to my mouth, it echoes and bleeds out.
