All the back and forth will make you numb
'Til you're fine with it
If you wanna sell your watch and drink all day
I'm fine with it
Pushed over the edge
It was a passionate rage
I was talking so fast
Never could explain

Far drive
Totally worth it
Just to see you
Act alive
Far drive
Act alive

You take pictures of everything
So afraid of remembering
Hi I'm Marth, from Hell
All of the flutter
I got diamond-dust shoes on my feet
I got New Orleans blood in me

It's a far drive
Totally worth it
Just to see you
Act alive
Plus being
In the car with
People you love is
Always a good time

Far drive
Totally worth it
Just to see you
Act alive
Plus being
In the car with
People you love is
Always a good time
People you love is
Always a good time

For miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
For miles and miles and miles and miles and miles (Far drive)
For miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
