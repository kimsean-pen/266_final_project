They come from the cities
And they come from the smaller towns
Beat up cars with guitars and drummers goin
Crash, boom, bam
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A., Yeah, yeah
They're rockin' in the U.S.A.

Well they said goodbye to their families
Said goodbye to their friends
With their pipe dreams in their heads
And very little money in their hands
Some are black and some are white
They ain't too proud to sleep on the floor tonight
With the blind faith of Jesus you know that they just might
Be rockin' in the U.S.A.

Hey

Voices from nowhere
And voices from the larger towns
Filled our head full of dreams
And turned our world upside down
There was Frankie Lymon - Bobby Fuller - Mitch Ryder
(They were Rockin')
Jackie Wilson - Shangri-Las - Young Rascals
(They were Rockin')
Spotlight on Martha Reeves
Let's don't forget James Brown
Rockin' in the U.S.A.
Hey
