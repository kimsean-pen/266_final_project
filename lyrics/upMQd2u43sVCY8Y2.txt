Save your sorrows
You're wasting daylight
There's no tomorrows
We're chasing taillights

Say you wanna talk, wanna work it out
Well, good luck, 'cause my head just touched the clouds
It's not that you are boring
It's just I'm bored of talking for tonight

Why don't you tell me over breakfast?
'Cause I don't wanna know now
Why don't you save it for your next breath?
'Cause I don't need to know now
'Cause all we should be isn't all that we need
And I don't wanna know why

Your words are ringing like bells
I'm tired of hearing
And I'll forget them
Soon as the sun has fallen

Still you wanna talk, wanna work it out
Well, good luck, 'cause my head is full of doubt
First you'll have to find me
I won't be putting up a fight tonight

Why don't you tell me over breakfast?
'Cause I don't wanna know now
Why don't you save it for your next breath?
'Cause I don't need to know now
'Cause all we should be isn't all that we need
Why don't you tell me over breakfast?
'Cause I don't wanna know now
Why don't you save it for your next breath?
'Cause I don't need to know now
'Cause all we should be isn't all that we need
And I don't wanna know why

Don't say, don't say it's over
Don't question me
'Cause I'm not the answer
And soon you'll see

Why don't you tell me over breakfast?
'Cause I don't wanna know now
Why don't you save it for your next breath?
'Cause I don't need to know now
'Cause all we should be isn't all that we need
Why don't you tell me over breakfast?
'Cause I don't wanna know now
Why don't you save it for your next breath?
'Cause I don't need to know now
'Cause all we should be isn't all that we need
And I don't wanna know why

So tell me over breakfast
