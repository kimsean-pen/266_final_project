Da-da-da-da-da da, da-da-da-da, da
Da-da-da-da-da da da da
Let's go

It's not easy making a name for yourself
Where do you draw the line?
I never thought I'd be in this far
Let's have some fun and never change, not for anyone
Try not to miss me when I'm gone

Woah, woah
I sold my soul to the open road
I live my life alone

You won't find me in the same spot
Believe me, I could never stop
My life's turned upside down
Meet me out past those train tracks
I'm leaving and not coming back
You're right and I was wrong
This town will be the downfall of us all

I'm gonna need you to try to follow along
I did the best that I could to try to write you songs
Now go tell them we sold out like we're the ones who changed
I will not fear this
No, not me and my sincerity
I sold my soul to the open road
I live my life alone!
You won't find me in the same spot, believe me - I could never stop
My life's turned upside down
Meet me out past those train tracks
I'm leaving and not coming back
You're right and I was wrong
This town will be the downfall of us all

Don't forget yourselves
We made up our minds
And we signed 3, 4, 5 on the dotted line!
Don't forget yourselves
We made up our minds
And we signed 3, 4, 5 on the dotted line!

You won't find me in the same spot, believe me - I could never stop
My life's turned upside down
Meet me out past those train tracks
I'm leaving and not coming back
You're right and I was wrong
You won't find me in the same spot, believe me - I could never stop
My life's turned upside down
Meet me out past those train tracks
I'm leaving and not coming back
You're right and I was wrong
This town will be the downfall of us all
This town will be the downfall of us all

Downfall of us all!
Downfall of us all!
Downfall of us all!
Downfall of us all!
