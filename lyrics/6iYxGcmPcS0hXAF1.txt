There are blue skies in my dreams
And laughter that seems undending
There are green grass fields there
And happiness and hope for tomorrow

My cup is full and my heart
Spills awkward and embarrassing blood
Onto white golden streets
And I am unashamed of the stains my steps leave

Tears stream down my cheeks
Only to meet their redeemer and be wiped away
And there is joy
