And I feel that time's a-wasting, Go
So where ya going to tomorrow?
And I see that these are lies to come
So Would you even care?

And I feel it
And I feel it

Where ya going for tomorrow?
Where ya goin' with the mask I found
And I feel, and I feel
When the dogs begin to smell her

Will she smell alone?

And I feel, so much depends on the weather
So is it raining in your bedroom?

And I see, that these are the eyes of disarray
Would you even care?

And I feel it
And she feels it
Where ya going for tomorrow?
Where ya goin' with the mask I found?

And I feel, and I feel
When the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?

When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it

To find it
To find it
When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow

To find it
To find it
To find it

Where ya going for tomorrow?
Where ya goin' with the mask I found?

And I feel, and I feel

When the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?
When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it
To find it
To find it
When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
To find it
To find it
To find it
To find it
To Find it
To Find it
