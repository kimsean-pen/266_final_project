Hold on, nothing's forever
I know, things will get better
Tired of the radio
It never makes me feel the way it should

Drivin' down the boulevard
It's a lonely road
And now and then can hit me hard
It's like I've seen a ghost
There's a shadow over me
It's with me all the way
You're my only one, my everything
I miss you every day

Hold on, nothing's forever
I know, things will get better
You used to love the radio
You'd sing along, and make it sound so
Good when we were together
And I miss you more than ever
Tired of the radio
It never makes me feel the way it should

I don't wanna be the one
On the hotel floor
Waking up in twenty years
Thinking what was it all for
I know I got to let you go
And you want me to be free
But I can't move on without you now
It's always you and me

Hold on, nothing's forever
I know, things will get better
You used to love the radio
You'd sing along, and make it sound so
Good when we were together
And I miss you more than ever
Tired of the radio
It never makes me feel the way it should

Hold on, nothing's forever
I know, things will get better
You used to love the radio
You'd sing along, and make it sound
The way it...
The way when we were together
And I miss you more than ever
Tired of the radio
It never makes me feel...
The way it should
The way it should

You know you gotta hold on
You know you gotta hold on
Yeah yeah

You know you gotta hold on
You know you gotta hold on
You know you gotta hold on
