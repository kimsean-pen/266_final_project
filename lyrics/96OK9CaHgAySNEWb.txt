Like a comet
Blazing 'cross the evening Sky
Gone too soon

Like a rainbow
Fading in the twinkling of an eye
Gone too soon

Shiny and sparkly
And splendidly bright
Here one day
Gone one night

Like the loss of sunlight
On a cloudy afternoon
Gone too soon

Like a castle
Built upon a sandy beach
Gone too Soon

Like a perfect flower
That is just beyond your reach
Gone too Soon

Born to amuse, to inspire, to delight
Here one day
Gone one Night

Like a sunset
Dying with the rising of the moon
Gone too soon
Gone too soon
