So what, you think this is usual?
Strange moon, strange land, strange man
Holdin' hands with tiny horses
Hold them, hold them kindly, man

Low red moon
How can you sleep like a baby? Sleep like baby
But you, you shine so different on the another
You shine different on the another, so strange

I look up and I see
The raising of an old hope
Brave and tattered
A shining knight with shining eyes
He shines around me brightly

So now, I say this is beautiful
I think you are strange

Low red moon
How can you sleep like a baby? Sleep like a baby
But you, you shine so different on the another
You shine different on the another

(Strange moon)
You made me cry when I was young
(Strange land)
And I was young
Now I got strong arms
Strong arms for a girl

And I say he belongs to me
(Strange moon)
He belongs to me, yeah
(Strange moon)
He belongs to me
(Strange moon, strange moon)
Sleep like a baby
(Strange moon)
