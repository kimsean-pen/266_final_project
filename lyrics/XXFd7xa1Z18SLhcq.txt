I love my computer,
You make me feel alright,
Every waking hour,
And every lonely night.
I love my computer,
For all you give to me,
Predictable errors and no identity.

And it's never been quite so easy,
I've never been quite so happy.

All I need to do,
Is click on you,
And we'll be joined in the most soul-less way,
And we'll never ever ruin each other's day,
'cause when I'm through I just click,
And you just go away.

I love my computer,
You're always in the mood,
I get so turned on,
When I turn on you.
I love my computer,
You never ask for more,
You can be a princess,
Or you can be my whore.

And it's never been quite so easy,
I've never been quite so happy.

All I need to do,
Is click on you,
And we'll be joined in the most soul-less way,
And we'll never ever ruin each other's day,
'cause when I'm through I just click,
And you just go away.

The world outside is so big,
But it's safe in my domain,
'cause to you I'm just a number,
And a clever screen name.

All I need to do,
Is click on you,
And we'll be together for eternity,
And no one's ever gonna take my love from me,
'cause I've got security,
Her password and a key.
