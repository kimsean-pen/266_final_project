Black white yellow and browns ok
Poolside drinking we come to stay
Got me thinking up ways to pray for my sanity

But you crown, oh
You crowned with the likes of us
Yeah you crown
You crown with the likes of us

You said I could call you any name that I want
Imma call you any name
I don't want the bag
I don't wanna go figure
You fishing cus it's all the same

Check me when you needed me the most
I ain't event get to talking 'bout a toast
Quiet on the set I don't need to stress
'Bout things that you want
Anything that you want
Rolls that you want
Signs you making bread
No coupons
I can't even make you famous
It's everything beside the way you make me feel

Black white yellow and browns ok
Poolside drinking we came to stay
Got me thinking up ways to pray for my vanity

But you crown, oh
You crown with the likes of us
Yeah you crown
You crown with the likes of us

So while you eating Kraft singles
I been switching phones
Trying not to think about the terms of it all
Wrapping up your life in cellophane
But that 911 on the lot is what you loving
We got 0-100 calls
We got Models with their egos on ya shelf
Choking up you on the run
Enough to say while you back in

Check me when you needed me the most
I ain't event get to talking bout a toast
Quiet on the set I don't need to stress
'Bout things that you want, ohh
