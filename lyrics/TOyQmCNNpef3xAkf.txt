And I swear it's the last time and I swear it's my last try
And we'll walk in circles around this whole block
Walk on the cracks on the same old sidewalks
And we'll talk about leaving town, yeah we'll talk about leaving
I swear it's the last time and I swear it's my last try

We rode across that bridge all night
We talked our way through city lights
Traced all the lines we're killing time
Under those buzzing signs
From downtown to anywhere but here

Tonight yeah I swear to these rooftops
And just hoped that car would never stop

And I swear it's the last time and I swear it's my last try
And we'll walk in circles around this whole block
Walk on the cracks on the same old sidewalks
And we'll talk about leaving town, yeah we'll talk about leaving
I swear it's the last time and I swear it's my last try

We drove around this place all night
Past closed signs and familiar sights
We're moving by passing time
Counting those center lines
With 20, 000 lines left to go

That lead to somewhere I don't know
It might be the time that we leave this all behind

And I swear it's the last time and I swear it's my last try
And we'll walk in circles around this whole block
Walk on the cracks on the same old sidewalks
And we'll talk about leaving town, yeah we'll talk about leaving
I swear it's the last time and I swear it's my last try

And there's been a few times
That we, we thought it felt right
To take the westbound signs
And just leave town tonight

And I swear it's the last time and I swear it's my last try
And we'll walk in circles around this whole block
Walk on the cracks on the same old sidewalks
And we'll talk about leaving town, yeah we'll talk about leaving
I swear it's the last time and I swear it's my last try
And I swear it's my last try
And we'll talk about leaving town
Yeah we'll talk about leaving town
