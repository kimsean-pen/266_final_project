Memorial Day came and went again
And I feel the same
How much you've changed
And I've heard all about
Where you've been
How you are now
But I'm still remembering
Last year's parade
Crowded streets with me
With a longing for nothing more

Memorial Day came and went again
And I feel the same
How much you've changed
And I'll let you take a stab at me
Maybe then you'll know what I mean

Last year's streets at summer's end
Left me with a longing for something more
I'll let you take a stab at me
I'll let you take a stab at me
