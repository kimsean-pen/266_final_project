I live far from any sea, you from any road
I've waited for someone like you for so long
But there's this ocean between us that cuts our bodies and cuts our hearts
We have to deal with this Pacific drowning us

I wrote for you my most beautiful song
And I sent it to you in a bottle all my love
It's hard to think you are beyond this point, where the blue of the sea meets
the blue sky
At least the moon is the same for both of us

And I go. I take a boat to move on
To the other side of world
And row against the flow to where I see
There's you, the ocean and me

I wrote for you my most beautiful song
And I sent it to you in a bottle all my love
All I want is to find
All I want is to find you

And I go. I take a boat to move on
To the other side of world
And row against the flow to where I see
There's you, the ocean and me

You tell me that being close is not a physical thing
I say it is
