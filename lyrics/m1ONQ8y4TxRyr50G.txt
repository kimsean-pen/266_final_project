Picking up to add a spice a bit
Please clicking, tricking, begging
Bite your nails hard sitting
New plant grows up inside

Spinning to up, upward
Catch it, crack it, watch it
Spinning to down, downward
Your plane crashed

Spinning to up, upward
Catch it, crack it, watch it
Spinning to down, downward
Snail's wale in the test file

You know all that shit
No flip you've done quite poor humor trite preach, no power to expect
I deny that wastes
I slap and spit to your frozen cheek and you are melted down

Wale in the test-file what a charming chaos
Shouting vicious piece between lines, wale in the test-file
Husking pallet, beeping wallet
How to do the right thing?

Holding a peeler, I'm looking for a caller
Filter suck your charter, I tear that tongue inside later
What a matter, what a ratter, you got
You're ticking and picking and licking
