I went away
This concrete don't have love for me
I took a day
Too much talk and not much to see
I know you always speak on something
So I'll leave on the mic for you

And I'm going all the way
But I'll leave on the lights for you
I'm going all the way
And now you're almost out of view
'Cause when I say what I mean you ought to know
You got to know
I don't let it go
'Cause when I say what I mean you ought to know
You got to know
I won't let it go
Away away away

Look what remains
Pour ashes where they claimed my name
They say I changed
What a pity if I stayed the same
Thinking that everything is funny
But don't say that the jokes on you

And I'm going all the way
But I'll leave on the lights for you
I'm going all the way
And now you're almost out of view

'Cause when I say what I mean you ought to know
You got to know
I don't let it go
Away away away
