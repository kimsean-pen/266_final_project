I'm just a girl from the city
You came to me, like Calvary
And now, all I want is to hold you now
I've been saving my soul for someone like you

So, let's love while we're young
So, let's love before we've even begun
Oh, darling, we'll be fine
So, let's love while we're young

You were the girl that came with the sunrise
Long, brown hair and emerald eyes
And now, I can't think of a day without you
I've been saving my soul for someone like you

So, let's love while we're young
So, let's love before we've even begun
Oh, darling, we'll be fine
So, let's love while we're young

So, let's love while we're young
So, let's love before we've even begun
Oh, darling, we'll be fine
So, let's love while we're young
