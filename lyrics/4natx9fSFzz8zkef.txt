You use your mind and I'll use my heart
Is this a good place for the future to start?
I'm not a born hustler but I'm playing my part
To make it work for you
If they kill us in the end then let's kill the end
If we ever get old let's not be old again
And I found those teen magazines under the bed
I'm not suspicious but it wasn't hard to find it

That's not written in the deal
Tell me a little more about how you feel
I don't wanna be smart like that
It just holds you back
It's a heart attack

Keep coming alive
Even when they try to cut you down to size
Say that's the breaks
Only cuz they built the world from their mistakes
Keep coming alive every time
We can even make that money on the side
In the light of brand new stars getting born tonight blinding my eyes

Looking for a job can't find one that matters
And I'm thinking about mistakes I can't rewind
Walking all around looking for the trigger
When the trigger was inside all this time

That's not written in the deal
Tell me a little more about how you feel
Barely holding on but I'm having fun
Pedal to the floor crazy shit we live for

Keep coming alive
Even when they try to cut you down to size
Say that's the breaks
Only cuz they see the world in their mistakes
Keep coming alive every time
We can even make that money on the side
In the light of brand new stars getting born tonight blinding my eyes

In the light
Brand new stars
Blinding my eyes
Shine so bright
There's new beginnings
In my mind
Pedal to the floor
Can't stop now
Crazy shit we live for
