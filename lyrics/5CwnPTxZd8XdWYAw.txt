Every day gets better cause I know you
My devotion grows by the hour
And I'm proud to show you
My love's enduring
So strong, so true
So reassuring
I owe all I am to you

Like a star from heaven
You are here to guide me
I can feel the goodness of you
Like a fire inside me
An inspiration
To see me through
For all creation
I owe all I am to you
To you, to you, to you
