Jealous vengeful fabrication
Halo-crowned invention
Sacred universal lie
Artificial, divine

Great archaic obseletum
A prevarication, deceitfully contrived

Synthesized, fictitious
Dreamed up by remote prototypes
Opiate for the yearning mass
Administered, applied

Three letter word for monster

Empty promises of healing
Profit aptly buried in the lies
An industry rapt with avarice
Medicatiing blind it's acolytes

Useless panacea
Imaginary cure-all
To you we cry and supplicate
Into your hell we fall

Blind belief in their eyes
Forever atoning
Credulousy waiting
Gazing to the skies
