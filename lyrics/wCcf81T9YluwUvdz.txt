Let me dance slowly
Won't you tell me why our love is so lonely
Are were just stumbling like we're wounded caught in the crossfire
Silently sober
I need you to hold me
Only you can make me feel it's not hopeless
Like there's more than just a blissfull ignorant light to life so
Let me dance slowly

Have the fires burn down
Is it save outside
Is it getting any better

I lose my mind, but I'm fine
I'm almost human
We don't need no fear
We don't need no burden
I'm fine
I'm almost human
We don't need no fear
We don't need to care at all
We don't need to care at all

Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe the time has come to let the world change me
And if my sins have made me care I'll stand by the center now
Men I said it was more than this

Have the fires burn down
Is it save outside
Is it getting any better

I lose my mind, but I'm fine
I'm almost human
We don't need no fear
We don't need no burden
I'm fine
I'm almost human
We don't need no fear
We don't need to care at all
We don't need to care at all

So let's get out of here
Let's just get up and go
Leave it all for the glory
So let the air flow by
And wash away the lie
Close your eyes for the journey
The future's caught on us
We're heading for the curve
Where we'll never be lonely
So let the air flow by
And wash away the lie
Close your eyes for the journey

I lose my mind, but I'm fine
I'm almost human
We don't need no fear
We don't need no burden
I'm fine
I'm almost human
We don't need no fear
We don't need to care at all
We don't need to care at all
