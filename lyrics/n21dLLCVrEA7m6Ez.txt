Let's drink a toast to that strange old feeling
That this is a moment without any meaning
This is a moment without any meaning

Let's make the most of when we stopped believing
Love is the only thing truly worth grieving
Love is the only thing truly worth needing

Maria Lionza
Lady hand me real arrows

Who do you love
The lover you can't forget
Who do you love
Or the lover you haven't met

Who do you love
The lover you can't forget
Who do you love
Or the lover you haven't met...
