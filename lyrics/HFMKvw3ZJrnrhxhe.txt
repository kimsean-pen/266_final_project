Landlord's knocking at my door, cussing me out
Got laid off my job the night before, can't figure how
I'm gonna fix tomorrow when yesterday's still a mess?
Can you tell me what's the point man, it all seems meaningless?

I wish that I could step away and breathe
This world's trying to swallow me
Clear away the clouds inside my head

Someone just tell me that it's okay now
What are you worryin' about?

Got my dreams, got my life, got my love
Got my friends, got the sunshine above
Why am I making this hard on myself
When there's so many beautiful reasons I have to be happy?

People lie, people hide, people cry, people fight
And they don't know why
If fear is all that we should fear then what are we so afraid of
'Cause fear is only in our heads

Someone please say that it's okay now
What are you worryin' about?
What are you worryin' about?

Got my dreams, got my life, got my love
Got my friends, got the sunshine above
Why am I making this hard on myself
When there's so many beautiful reasons I have to be happy?

Any day I'll go mad thinking bad
Everyone is against me and the world wants to fight me
Preparing to battle an enemy unseen

During my stressing I'm blinded to the lesson
That could be a blessing if I'd be confessing that the enemy
I'm trying to beat is hiding in me

But it's okay now
What are you worryin' about?

Got my dreams, got my life, got my love
Got my friends, got the sunshine above
Why am I making this hard on myself
When there's so many beautiful reasons I have to be happy?

Keep your grind on girl
It's your life, it's your world
Keep your grind on girl
It's your life, it's your world

Got my dreams, got my life, got my love
Got my friends, got the sunshine above
Why am I making this hard on myself
When there's so many beautiful reasons I have to be happy?
