Yellow eyes are seen circling...
A whirlwind arriving for the passing storm
The hunt... the hunter inside
A whirlwind arriving

The wanderer wanders too far from the gold distance

Where they live
Where the quiet lay their drowning heads at night
Flesh drapes on the smoking ground
And then spills
(Yellow eyes close in)
Onto the teeth of the once protected

Yellow
Yellow
Yellow

Our souls grip onto a wall
Our minds slip past this old soul

Yellow
Yellow
Yellow

Smoke is seen in both directions
My creation sits... my progress awaits
Smoke is seen in both directions
In rubble... their creation
Somewhere in the distance... somewhere
The softness of snow mutes my travels
Somewhere in the distance... somewhere

This landscape seems to change too often for comfort
A blinking light hides as I stumble downward
A stillness... it's too quiet

The hum of electricity
My crumbling bones seem to weld the new author
A stillness... it's too quiet
The hum of electricity... seems to buzz
The hum of electricity
The hum of electricity... seems to buzz

Cut an X in my palm.
Leave my mark
A translation for
Whatever created this world for me
I sit under the crimson moon
Whatever created this world for me
Whatever created this world for me

Yours or mine?
They or this?
Yellow eyes

Yellow eyes

Tread light
Collisions open on us more
Revise
The simple task of our own

We serve
Our own hell
We serve
Our own hell
We serve
Our own hell

A cocoon leaking our own conclusions
We serve our hell well
Cope with disguise

Inner working dissect
Common phase neglect
(With no logic)
Inner working dissect
Common phase neglect
(With no logic)

I am tangible with no logic

Change my focus, drown my spirits
There's more to this than it may seem
Change my focus, drown my spirits
There's more to this than it may seem

Blink fast into hollow ground...
Blink fast into hollow ground...
