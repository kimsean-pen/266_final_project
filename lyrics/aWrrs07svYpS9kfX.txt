She's had to peel me off the pavement
Trying to insinuate
Sometimes I am in danger of going too far
Said would I like to go for tea and toast?
Get your hand off my thigh
In the car she turned to me and said

You're not nineteen forever, pull yourselves together
I know it seems strange but things they change
Older woman and a younger man
Both of them doing all they can

Trying to get your attention
All night long asked you once, I asked you twice
Asked you four times if you'd like to dance to that song
Front crawled the crowd down the stairs and then I followed you out in the rain
Nowhere to be found, never mind
You'll probably never look that pretty again

You're not nineteen forever pull yourselves together
I know it seems strange but things they change
Older woman and ever so slightly younger man
God bless the band, they're doing all they can

You're not nineteen forever pull yourselves together
I know it seems strange but things they change
Older woman and ever so slightly younger man
God bless the band, they're doing all they can

You're not nineteen forever
You're not nineteen forever
You're not nineteen forever
It's not big you're definitely not clever
