Hear the air raid sirens that warn you of your death
Close your eyes, say goodbye, and take your last breath
Turn this place to rubble, a city turns to ash
Nuclear fire will turn the sand to glass

Bombers bringing death with every fly ahead
Total fucking holocaust, everyone's dead
Death and destruction is all you'll ever know
Living in the ashes that you once called home

Scream out for mercy, Hell can be seen
Scream out for freedom, wake me from this dream
Chaos runs rampant, the city burns in flames
No hope for us, and no one will be saved

War is hell, tanks secure the line
Bomber above, destroying all the time
Hear the air raid sirens that warn you of your death
Close your eyes, say goodbye and take your last breath

War is fucking hell
War is fucking hell
War is fucking hell
War is fucking hell

Hear the air raid sirens that warn you of your death
Close your eyes, say goodbye, and take your last breath
Turn this place to rubble, a city turns to ash
Nuclear fire will turn the sand to glass

Bombers bringing death with every fly ahead
Total fucking holocaust, everyone's dead
Death and destruction is all you'll ever know
Living in the ashes that you once called home
