"You're not free with your Cadillac!
You're doin' just exactly what the Man wants you to do
Buy his goods, so you'll never have any real economic freedom
He wants you to buy everything he, he advertises on TV
So he'll keep you perpetually owin' your soul to the company store
You're not free, you're a slave—!"

Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we lookin' for that buzz
Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we lookin' for that buzz

What's with these superficial people from my past?
Dancin' 'round the fact that I did everything the motherfuckers bet against
They be like, "Gather 'round, place your bets!"
"This young man won't ever be shit!"
Well my bad, I guess I just pursued this shit
While you chose to settle down to have some kids
I mean, it's okay to fall in line, just don't look back
That's a long ass line that I'm not in
I just never found the time, or had the chance
Truth is: you can kiss my ass!
Never been the one to bow down
Never been the one to air out any situation, but right now
When it's all your fault, I'm here now

Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we lookin' for that buzz
Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we lookin' for that buzz

Don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy
Don't, don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy
Don't, don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy
Don't, don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy, don't

Thrift like a five hundred discount
I move it, I move it like Madagascar
Flip it like eight ball to inside of nose, it get raw
Bloody leaf color like fall
When you were callin', they said I'll be nothin'
Well, suck on my dick and then lick on my balls
They try to pin me down, they try to bind me
And they try to kill me like Anna Nicole
Th–th–they want to boot up my car
Pussy boy like booty call, money quick like auctioneer
Look what we did in a year, you need a neutral career
I hate on myself when I look in the mirror
Piddlin' voices all up in my ear
Why do I care how I look? Why do I care what they say?
I do not care what they say! (Rrruh!)

Nowadays, everybody wanna talk (Niggas talk too much!)
They forgot how to listen (Listen!)
Till the prophets arisen we mix New Edition with nuclear fission
I don't do auditions, I don't ask permission
Ain't no politician, don't ask my opinion
You got an addiction to what ain't your business
Make the admission, I make like magicians and hit my Houdini
Why they so soft like linguine? I murder this music routinely
I know that you see me, don't see you searchin' the meanin'
I think that's why you won't believe and the future is leanin'
Revolutions started streamin', the reason why you see me beamin'
I'm dreamin' of makin' moves like the government
You better think about who you fuckin' with, get back!

Don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy
Don't, don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy
Don't, don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy
Don't, don't talk back
Don't talk back, boy, don't

(Freak, ah, ah) Oh, your love–
Won't you come this close to me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be with me now that you're free (Free, free)
Oh, yeah (Yeah)
Won't you come this close to me, baby?
Baby, yeah (Yeah)

And if I could erase who you thought I was
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
And if I could erase who you thought I was
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
