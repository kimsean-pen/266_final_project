There's a hole in your logic
You who know all the answers, oh oh oh oh
You claim science ain't magic
And expect me to buy it

Goodbye Mr A
You promised you would love us
But you knew too much
Goodbye Mr A
You had all the answers
But no human touch
If life is subtraction
Your number is up
Your love is a fraction
It's not adding up
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

So busy showing me where I'm wrong
You forgot to switch your feelings on, oh oh oh oh

So so superior, are you not?
You'd love a little bit but you forgot

Goodbye Mr A
You promised you would love us
But you knew too much
Goodbye Mr A
You had all the answers
But no human touch
If life is subtraction
Your number is up
Your love is a fraction
It's not adding up

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Goodbye Mr A
Goodbye Mr A

Goodbye Mr A
The world was full of wonder
'Til you opened my eyes
Goodbye Mr A
Wish you hadn't blown my mind
And killed the surprise
Goodbye Mr A
You promised you would love us
But you knew too much
Goodbye Mr A
You had all the answers
But no human touch
If life is subtraction
Your number is up
Your love is a fraction
It's not adding up
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
