Half a day behind
And miles away
I'm on a beach
The only one around
I know who can't
Enjoy the
heat

I bought the postcard
Now I have to write
the words
I left the country
There's a chance you
may have heard

Grand Cayman is great
Of course
it is
Weather like this

Living is great
Of
course it is
What else did you think

What else
did you think

I said I want a man
And not a
boy
You left the room
The Caribbean sun
So leaves
me cold
You never do

I want to see you
Even want to see you bleed
I can't believe I paid
for this
There's nothing here I need!

Grand Cayman is great
Of course it is
Weather like
this

Living is great
Of course it is
What
else did you think

What else did you think
