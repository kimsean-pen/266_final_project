Step back, look forward
There's nothing for us here
Our lives have been wasted
Cowering in fear
Violence, hate, pride
Hunger, greed, spite

We thought we were invincible
The end isn't near
The end is here
We thought we were unbreakable
To save us we must end us

We must end us
We must die

Ruled by monsters
With no faces
Living life with no name
We are forgotten
We are abandoned
The darkness is our home
We are forgotten
We are abandoned
Hell has come for us

We thought we were invincible
The end isn't near
The end is here
We thought we were unbreakable
To save us we must end us

We thought we were invincible
We thought we were unbreakable
To save us we must end us

The demons rip into my chest
Extracting a disease we spent years trying to suppress
Constricting veins
Bloodshot eyes
Hell has come to claim its prize

There's no way out
No way out

Nothing can stop the storm
That's destined to wipe away the stains
Leaving nothing behind
But life, death, and unending pain

There's no way out
When you're born to die
