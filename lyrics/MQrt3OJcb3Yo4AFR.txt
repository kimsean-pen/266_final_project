Time taunts me. says,

[you're getting older. are you growing colder, hmm?" and time and time again, i doubt who i am. what a tragic ending. don't let go of my hand. and today, i'll give you all my time. and you can count on me, for you look so tired. and today, it's time for you to rest. i know you've done your best, so rest your aching mind.]
