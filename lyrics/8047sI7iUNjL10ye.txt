Took a boat sunday, down by the sea
It just felt so nice, you and me
We didn't have a problem or a care on earth
And all around was silence, everywhere

You are the reason I was born
To be with you through all seasons
I'll always hear you when you call

We'll keep the love light shining
Through each night and day
A lonely life behind me
Oh, what a change you've made

So down here, on the ocean
We will stay, we will stay, we will stay
Been through a lot of changes
Turned a lot of pages
When I took a boat on sunday

To know you as I know you now
That is all I need
And we will get along somehow
If we both believe

So down here, on the ocean
We will stay, we will stay, we will stay
Been through a lot of changes
Turned a lot of pages
When I took a boat on sunday
