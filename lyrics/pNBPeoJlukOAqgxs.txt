We may not be hopeless
But we're still helpless in the end
Just remember your floating
Remember the love that we were in

So inconstantly we swim
A time with family and our friends
I know I'm not hopeless
I'm only helpless in the end

I know you love questions

But they go unanswered in the end
Did you forget you're floating
Did you forget we were only men

We're getting all our time
Time isn't working my side

We're getting all our time
Time isn't working my side

Time isn't working my side
Time isn't working my side

We're getting all our time, time, time

Time isn't working my side
Time isn't working my side

Time isn't working my side
Time isn't working my side

Time isn't working my side
Time isn't working my side

Time isn't working my side
Time isn't working my side
