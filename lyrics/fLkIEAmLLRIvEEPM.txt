Recitation from tomes of trepidation
Peering up the frock of glory within wicked fields of calm
The lesions lessons
His image ever a reminder
Iconic respire
Thesis ever unaltered
Endless veils ever hidden
Now they have lifted the shrine
Passing the seed through fire

Visage of the abyss set against you

Holy! Holy! Holy!

Most savage of faiths
His mark

Holy! Holy! Holy!

Ever igneous tongue of eremitic gospels
