When I was born
I was promised the world
to keep dragging through
with out complaining

i want contentment
But All I have is scorn

In - the - back of my mind
I - know that I'm in -
the - warmth - of
a - dying sun

I found solace in
anything that I could
distract my mind From
this impending failure

You brought me to this earth
but you can't
expect me to follow you

I will not be forced
to be miserable
even if happiness
is temporary

I accept my fate
and I'll smile through the worst

The world is losing light
and there's nothing left to borrow
I was promised so much
but all that is left
are these bones and false gold
bones and false gold

I found something sacred

Walk this
path paved with silver and gold
To find it goes nowhere

I walk on in the warmth of a dying sun
