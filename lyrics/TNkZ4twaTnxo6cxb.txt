You're a pretty good girl
And you do what they want you to do
But you don't believe in what they say

When you're alone in your room
You light some candles and you start to pray
But you don't pray to the god they pray to

Please, can you help me?
Please, can you show me the way?
Please, can you help me?
When will the fallen angel arise?

Just follow the morningstar
It will guide you on your way to salvation
Just follow the morningstar
It will heal your broken soul
Just follow the morningstar, morningstar, morningstar

God has never helped you
God has never listened to you
And you're tired of waiting
And you're tired of praying

Please, can you help me?
Please, can you show me the way?
Please, can you help me?
When will the fallen angel arise?

Just follow the morningstar
It will guide you on your way to salvation
Just follow the morningstar
It will heal your broken soul
Just follow the morningstar, morningstar, morningstar...
