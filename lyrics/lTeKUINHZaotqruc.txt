This isn't for you, this isn't for you

I speak in tongues
Teen face for the dream date
That girl wears black jeans
That girl wears black jeans

Yeah, paint it all black
Yeah, paint it all black
Yeah, paint it all black
Yeah, yeah, yeah

This isn't for you, this isn't for you
That girl wears black jeans
I want her to

Kiss those black jeans into me
Kiss those black jeans into me

This isn't for you
Teen face for the dream date
That girl wears black jeans
That girl wears black jeans

I want her to paint it all black
Paint it all black
Paint it all black, yeah
