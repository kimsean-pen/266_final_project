On the edge of the water where the ships pass by
and the sound of your laughter in the endless sky
tips my head back, full of swimming thoughts
beneath deep breathing that sinks so far down
that sings so far down

and I handle my business and I know the prize
is of no consequence. You have looked with your eyes
wide open to what's inside, that sinks so far down

I'm in two

I went looking, went searching under the water
sinking and pushing, till you pulled me under
to where you are, to where we build our house
and so we sink so far down
and we can't go back now, can't go back now

on the edge of the water where the ships pass by
and the sound of your laughter in the endless sky
tips my head back, full of swimming thoughts
beneath deep breathing

now I stay holding this honesty with you

I went looking, went searching under the water
sinking and pushing, till you pulled me under
to where you are, to where we build our house
and so we sink so far down
and we can't go back now

sink so far down when I know you're around
and I can't go back now, can't go back now
