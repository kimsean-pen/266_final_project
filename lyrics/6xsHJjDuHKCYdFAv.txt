Into the morning you could never show me
You're looking lonely, everybody's lonely
Calling a uber, a friendly kinda user
Told me to choose her, leaving with our pockets
overflowing with promise
Nights could slip inside us,
wish i could deny this
everybody's running when you're
into the sorid, everybody loaded
Now it's a moment. A dream we're never gonna forget
Swimming in a sea of pearls, just a cocaine girl
Living down inside the surf, you're just a cocaine girl
Swimming in a sea of pearls, just a cocaine girl
Living down inside the surf, you're just a cocaine girl
Down to the wayside, down so you can see my
demo's and levi's
Everybody moving to the
rooftop for sunrise,
morning lines and high lines
You in my eyelines, know you're gonna leave me behind
Into the morning, you walked to the shore and
Under the ocean, washing every single moment
clean of my white lies
Some recycled highlights.
Perfected skylines.
Leave me without saying goodbye
Swimming in a sea of pearls, just a cocaine girl
Living down inside the surf, you're just a cocaine girl
Swimming in a sea of pearls, just a cocaine girl
Living down inside the surf, you're just a cocaine girl
Swimming in a sea of pearls, just a cocaine girl
Living down inside the surf, you're just a cocaine girl
Swimming in a sea of pearls, just a cocaine girl
Living down inside the surf, you're just a cocaine girl
Swimming in a sea of pearls, just a cocaine girl
Living down inside the surf, you're just a cocaine girl
Swimming in a sea of pearls, just a cocaine girl
Living down inside the surf, you're just a cocaine girl
