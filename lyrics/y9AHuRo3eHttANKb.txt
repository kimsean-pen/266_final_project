Silence
Here I am
Here I am
Silent

Bright and clear
It's what I am
I have
Died

Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama
Death
With violence
Excitement

Right here
Died
Go to hell
Here I am

Right here
Ow!
Mamas, Mamas, Mamas, Mama
Death

Is what I am
Go to hell
Go to jail
In back of that
Crime
Here I am
Take a chance
Dead
Die!
