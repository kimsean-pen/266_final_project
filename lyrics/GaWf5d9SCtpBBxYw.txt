I held Death's hand this evening

Can't keep my heart from beating
Can't keep my throat from screaming
There has to be another way for me to keep on living

I held Death's hand this evening
Closed my eyes, now I'm dreaming
I promise I won't leave here
"Don't let me die", I'm fucking screaming

'Cause I've got more life left to live, got some promises to keep
To all the hearts that carried me out from the ocean deep
I've had to do some searching to understand the reasons for every selfish feeling
I held Death's hand this evening

Now my lungs are failing, and my heart is fading
My mind is taking me so far away I'm dreaming
For every selfish reason, I tipped the bottle drowning
I'll pour my heart out to stop you from leaving

I held Death's hand this evening
Closed my eyes, now I'm dreaming
I promise I won't leave here
"Don't let me die", I'm fucking screaming!

'Cause I've got more life left to live, got some promises to keep
To all the hearts that carried me out from the ocean deep
I've had to do some searching to understand the reasons for every selfish feeling
I held Death's hand this evening

You're the ones that kept me going
I owe you this much
You gave me the strength to say
"Hey Death, get fucked"
You're the ones that kept me going
I owe you this much
You gave me the strength to say
"Hey Death, get fucked"

Now my lungs are failing, and my heart is fading
My mind is taking me so far away I'm dreaming
Now my lungs are failing, and my heart is fading
My mind is taking me
