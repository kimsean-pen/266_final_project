Count it down from 10 to 1
Faster than a firefly
Callin' out to everyone, are you dead or alive
Quicker than the curious
And brighter than a meteor
Never knowing who to trust make me insecure

Let me clear my throat, let me catch my breath
Let my heart bleed out 'till there's nothing left
It's my day to be brilliant
It's my day to be brilliant

Count it down from 10 to 1
Faster than a hurricane
Callin' out to everyone, are you mad or insane
Quicker when you're curious
And better once you realize
Finding someone you can trust, it's results, check your pulse

Let me clear my throat, let me catch my breath
Let my heart bleed out 'till there's nothing left
It's my day to be brilliant
It's my day to be brilliant

Say it if you're one of us
The beaten and the furious
Then Justice, endless, for the very last time
It's all the same believe it or not
But this ain't a game and I'll never stop
So you'd better run for your life

Let me clear my throat, let me catch my breath
Let my heart bleed out 'till there's nothing left
It's my day to be brilliant
It's my day to be brilliant

To whom it may concern
I won't crash and burn
Burn, burn
I won't crash and...

Let me clear my throat, let me catch my breath
Let my heart bleed out 'till there's nothing left
It's my day to be brilliant
It's my day to be brilliant

As the world collides and I fight for air
As I crash and burn like I just don't care
It's my day to be brilliant
It's my day to be brilliant

Count it down from 10 to 1
Quicker when your curious
Say it if you're one of us
The beaten and the furious

Are you mad or insane, mad or insane
Are you mad or insane, you'd better run for your life

It's my day to be brilliant
It's my day to be brilliant
