Baby here I am
I'm the man on the scene
I can give you what you want
But you gotta' come home with me
I've got some good old lovin'
And I got some more in store
When I get through throwin' it on you
You gotta' come back for more

Boys and things that come by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Hey little thing let, me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now, yessiram

Action speaks louder than words
And I'm a man of great experience
I know you got another man
But I can love you better than him
Take my hand, don't be afraid

I'm advertising love for free
So you can place your ad with me

Boys will come along, a dime by the dozen
