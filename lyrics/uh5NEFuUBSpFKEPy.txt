It's getting cold all aver again
so I'll be inside way too much again
You'll have to believe me
You have to hear me when I say
I'll make something up just so that
You believe in me

This is becoming to routine for me
There will be time for the tomorrow,
But it's days like this that keep me alive
Is there anything left for me?

Daylight's almost over now,
Can't think of anymore to say
Even if I try to understand
It won't ever be the same
Is there anything left for me?
