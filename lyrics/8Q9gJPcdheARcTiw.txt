Crumple my bones, weave like the road
Hold you like gold, cold as a stone
I can't deceive what you don't believe
And you don't believe in me

Suffering sweet like sickness scarred to a laugh
She's my witness startin' to crack
Something save me free of my past
Ivory Black

Hold you like gold, I'll find my home
Crumple my bones, hold up this throne
I can't deceive what you don't believe
And you don't believe in me

Suffering sweet like sickness scarred to a laugh
She's my witness startin' to crack
Something save me free of my past
Ivory Black

I wanna be loud like white wine after a glass
Warm like the sunshine kissing my back
Drive me crazy, I like it like that
Ivory Black

Souls take and tear
Souls take and tear

Sweet like sickness scarred to a laugh
She's my witness startin' to crack
Something save me free of my past
Ivory Black

I wanna be loud like white wine after a glass
Warm like the sunshine kissing my back
Drive me crazy, I like it like that
Ivory Black
