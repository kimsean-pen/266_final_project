Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down

He told me that he like this, he like this
He wanna take his time with me, like this
Let me show you how I wind it, like this
Let me show you like, like, show you like, like
Take your body downtown, but right round
Like you better with the lights down, but right down
Higher than the ceiling, hotter than the sun
You want some of me? Baby come get some, l-l-like

Rap game flow on the radio
Two bad ones with me, we ain't goin' home
I'm a good girl, baby, tell me what you want
What you want, what you want

I got you blood flow pumpin' like this
Got you so spaced out, floatin' on the mist
Get you in my backroom in a little bit
Just give me a minute, I know you with it

He told me that he like this, he like this
He wanna take his time with me, like this
Let me show you how I wind it, like this
Let me show you like, like, show you like, like
Take your body downtown but right round
Like you better with the lights down, but way down
Higher than the ceiling, hotter than the sun
You want some of me? Baby come get some, l-l-like

Can't keep my name off your lips
Just make your eyes don't move off my hips
You're the thunder, thunder, crackin' like a whip
Don't resist, just admit...

I got you blood flow pumpin' like this
Got you so spaced out, floatin' on the mist
Ready, set, go, all the way, don't quit
Just come get it, I know you with it

He told me that he like this, he like this
He wanna take his time with me, like this
Let me show you how I wind it, like this
Let me show you like, like, show you like, like
Take your body downtown but right round
Like you better with the lights down, but way down
Higher than the ceiling, hotter than the sun
You want some of me? Baby come get some, l-l-like
