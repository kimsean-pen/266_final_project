See your face on the face of strangers
Like everywhere I go
Is it a lifetime sentence?
I really need to know

I long to love like it's never been broken
To smile like it's never been used
I don't understand why you're hiding from me
I need to know what you're hiding from me

I wanna know where the love is
And why is she running from me
Still so lost in this world so cold and shallow
How can you be so cold and shallow?

I'm so fed up, I'm fed, I mean, I'm so fed up

Shouldn't miss you now but I miss you
Like every single day
Is it a lifetime sentence?
It surely feels that way

To love like it's never been broken
To smile like it's never been used
I don't understand why you're hiding from me
I need to know what you're hiding from me

I wanna know where the love is
And why is she running from me
Still so lost in this world so cold and shallow
How can you be so cold and shallow?

I'm so fed up, I'm fed, I mean, I'm so fed up

Longing, longing, longing
Always missing something
Nobody knows it
Missing, missing, missing
Always short for something

I wanna know where the love is
And why is she running from me
Still so lost in this world so cold and shallow
How can you be so cold and shallow?

I'm so fed up, I'm fed, I mean, I'm so fed up
