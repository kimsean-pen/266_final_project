You shatter me
Your grip on me
A hold on me
So dull it kills
You stifle me
Infectious sense of Hopelessness and prayers for rain
I suffocate
I Breathe in dirt
And nowhere shines but desolate
And drab the hours
All spent on killing time
Again all waiting for the rain

You fracture me
Your hands on me
A touch so plain so stale it kills
You strangle me
Entangle me in hopelessness and prayers for rain I deteriorate
I live in dirt
And nowhere glows but drearily
And tired the hours all spent on
killing time again all waiting for the rain
