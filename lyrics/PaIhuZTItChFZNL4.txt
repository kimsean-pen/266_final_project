Theres a certain kind of way I know that you and I could be
But I should probably tell you in advance
Im sorry
Im afraid that things are changing
I dont know if I can face it
Im thinking 'bout a time that we were only seventeen
We wouldnt ever lie about the things we were feeling
Is it me thats getting colder?
Maybe I dont wanna know that
All this time
my head and heart were out of sync
But I know that
The ship is slowly sailing
Now upside
I try to string my way against the changing tide
The coast is slowly fading
whatever comes to mind is just my hallow memory
if i was any more than just a wonder
im falling
i could see that im a simple man
too much thinking for my heart
oh no dont go,
i give you everything you wanted and even more
i cant know for how long
but if he told you who to love then just forget about it
All this time
My head and heart were out of sync
But I know that
The ship is slowly sailing
Now upside
I try to string my way against the changing tide
The coast is slowly fading
its only right to know that in history
but it wants to find just to know it wasnt meant to be
all this time my head and heart were out of sync
but i know that
the ship is slowly fading
Now upside i try to string myway against the changing tide
The coast is slowly fading
changing tide
the coast is slowly fading
changing tide
the coast is slowly fading
