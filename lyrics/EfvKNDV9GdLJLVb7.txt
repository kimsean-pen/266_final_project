Like shotgun bullets to the chest
I'm barely breathin'
You came from the space, got the best of me
Now I'm barely speakin'
I get the feeling
You know what it's like to be human too
In this world full of zeroes and ones
I think we are the only ones

We are the only ones
We are the only ones

Like calculus, trigonometry
It's complicated
And the pain you feel's like an ice-cold maze
Underrated
And every soul you meet
Tries to mend your broken wings
And everyone is overdone
I guess we are the only ones

We are the only ones
We are the only ones

Something deep in you I recognize
Feels like my heart is on the line this time
'Cause I get the feeling, you know what it's like to be human
In this world full of zeroes and ones, baby, we are the only ones

We are the only ones
We are the only ones
We are the only ones
We are the only ones
