Works of art
Fill the room
With home truths
Tightly wound
Shit gets dark
When I lose

Hope [?] back
Then where should I be
Slowly find
These ambitions

Here it comes now
The fear only waits so much
Torn apart as we try to conceal
What's going on

Here I stand
In your machine beneath me
Pulled apart
It's just like we said it'd be

Warning signs
Filled my eyes with envy
The more I try
The more it hurts when I bleed

Here it comes now
The fear only waits so much
Torn apart as we try to conceal
What's going on

Every breath
Seems to draw heavy
There's no way
To keep my hands steady
Don't you see
I am the one story

Here it comes now
The fear only waits so much
Torn apart as we try to conceal
What's going on

Somewhere wildness grows
In a place deep down
