I hear it in your silence
when you don't speak...
well what's funny then
isn't funny anymore.

I can hear it in your voice
there's always a catch
we're going nowhere
and we're going there fast.

Anything to watch
while we are waiting for this Apocalypse
What more is there to do?
It's nice to be important, but so close to being despised
It's more important to be nice, I guess, than being wise

I'll take you shopping
I'll take you dancing too
I'll take you out, all the thing you wanna do
I'll give you diamonds, and I'll give you space
So be with anyone you want
It's alright with me.

Our time is over
Don't you know that if a time-warp was open
I'd stay right in my place
That war is over

I hear it in your silence, when you don't speak
there is a quiet crying rage
burning inside you, so deep
I'll give you anything, but I'll give you problems
So be with anyone you want, it's alright with me.

I hear it in your voice, can see it in your lips
There's always a catch... I guess that's alright with me
No one's around, but the map says "you are here"
Now I can hear loneliness screaming in my ear.

Our time is over
Don't you know that if a time-warp was open
I'd stay right in my place
The war ain't over yet
This war ain't over yet...
Being nice is only hard when others aren't
Our time is over
