If you're listening (Whoa oh oh oh oh)
Sing it back (Whoa oh oh oh oh)
String from your tether unwinds
(String from your tether unwinds)
(Whoa oh, woah oh)
Up and outward to bind
(Up and outward to bind)
(Whoa oh, whoa oh)
I was spinning free (Whoa oh oh oh oh)
With a little sweet and simple numbing me
Are you listening? (Whoa oh oh oh oh)
Sing it back (Whoa oh oh oh oh)
So tell me what do I need?
(Tell me what do I need?)
(Whoa oh, whoa oh)
When words lose their meaning
(When words lose their meaning)
(Whoa oh, whoa oh)
I was spinning free (Whoa oh oh oh oh)
With a little sweet and simple numbing me
Stumble 'til you crawl (Whoa oh oh oh oh)
Sinking into sweet uncertainty

(Are you listening? Are you listening?)
If you're listening (Whoa oh oh oh oh)
(If you're listening, are you listening?)
Sing it back (Whoa oh oh oh oh)
(If you're listening, are you listening?)
And I'm still running away
(I'm still running away)
Whoa oh (Whoa oh)
Whoa oh (Whoa oh)
I won't play your hide and seek game
(Your hide and seek game)
Whoa oh (Whoa oh)
Whoa oh
I was spinning free (Whoa oh oh oh oh)
With a little sweet and simple numbing me
What a dizzy dance (Whoa oh oh oh oh)
This sweetness will not be concerned with me
No, the sweetness will not be concerned with me
No, the sweetness will not be concerned with me
