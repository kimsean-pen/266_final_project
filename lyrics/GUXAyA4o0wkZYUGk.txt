I'm so afraid of where my life's going
Guess I've been ashamed, somehow I kept going
So tell me I'm good, tell me I'm good
Tell me I'm good
Say I've done all I could, I've done all I could

I hope I find a peace of mind
In all of my woe-oe-oes
I hope the rain, it brings a light
To my broken sou-ou-oul
I hope I lose myself in the city
But find my ho-o-o-o-ome
I hope I live my life
Before I go

Hope I've been awake and I didn't sleep through it all
And every last drop of faith, oh I can drink it all
I'll take it all in, I'll take it all in
I'll take it all in

I hope I find a peace of mind
In all of my woe-oe-oes
I hope the rain, it brings a light
To my broken sou-ou-oul
I hope I lose myself in the city
But find my ho-o-o-o-ome
I hope I live my life
Before I go
I hope I live
Before I go
I hope I...
I hope I...
I hope I...
I hope I...

I hope I lose myself in the city, but find my home
I hope I live my life before I go
I hope I live before I go
I hope I live before I go
I hope I live before I go
I hope I live before I go
