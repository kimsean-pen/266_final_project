This is a story about control, my control
Control of what I say, control of what I do
And this time I'm gonna do it my way
I hope you enjoy this as much as I do

Are we ready? I am
'Cause it's all about control
And I've got lots of it

When I was seventeen
I did what people told me
Did what my father said
And let my mother mold me
But that was a long ago, I'm in

Control
(Never gonna stop)
Control
(To get what I want)

Control
(I like to have a lot)
Control
(Now I'm all grown up)

First time I fell in love
I didn't know what hit me
So young and so naive
I thought it would be easy
Now I know I've got to take

Control
(Now I've got a lot)
Control
(To get what I want)

Control
(I'm never gonna stop)
Control
(Now I'm all grown up)

Jam, ooh, ooh
Rebel, that's right
I'm on my own, I'll call my own shots
Thank you

Got my own mind
I wanna make my own decisions
When it has to do with my life, my life
I wanna be the one in control

So let me take you by the hand
And lead you [Incomprehensible] this dance
(Control)
It's what I got
Because I took a chance

I don't wanna rule the world
Just wanna run my life, ooh
So make your life a little easier
When you get the chance, just take

Control, ooh, ooh
(Now I've got a lot, ooh)
Control
(To get what I want, ow)

Control
(I'm never gonna stop)
Control
(Now I'm all grown up, ooh)

Free at last
Out here on my own
Ooh, ooh, ooh yeah
Now control this, uh

Control
(That's right)
Control
(Career moves)

Control
(I do what's right for me)
Control
(And me wants to groove, is that okay?)
Yeah, ooh, control

I've got my own mind, ooh, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I've got my own mind
Wanna make my own decisions

When it has to do with my life
I wanna be the one in control
Hop to it, I'm in control
And I love it, ha, ha, ha, that's right

Control
(Now I've got a lot)
Control
(Now I'm all grown up, ah)

I'm in control, uh
I'm in control, ah
I'm in control, uh
Don't make me lose it
Control
