Box number -The Boys

I'm sick and tired of all the good times, bad times The
petty little everyday problems
Who needs yours honey when I've got mine

Gonna disconnect me from the hard world
Lock myself away with a bad girl
Reach me care of box number nine three nine

Box number nine three nine
Box number nine three nine
Box number nine three nine

Gonna take my number from the phone book
Leaving my receiver offa my hook
If you got a problem dial nine nine nine

Gonna stock my hideaway with a
Year's supply of TV dinners
Reach me care of box number nine three nine
