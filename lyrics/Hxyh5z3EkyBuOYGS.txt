u've taken the last of me
The god's of your innocence shall not protect you from the hate
of my wrath
You've taken the last of me
Blame the end on yourself
You deserve each tear that falls
Scratch out your eyes

The blood will drown you in red
And I will leave you for dead
A lovely evening draped in regret
The shadow of justice now engulfs you
As cold hands reap the pain they've sewn
You've taken the last of me
Blame the end on yourself
You deserve each tear that falls
Scratch out your eyes

The blood will drown you in red
And I will leave you for dead
A lovely evening draped in regret
Forever gone... the taste of your death Replaced the smell
of your breath
A lovely evening draped in regret

Suffocate your will to live with my pain
You were so easily seduced by greed
You could never feel my calloused hands closing around your throat
Taste your loss
Wake into the nightmare that has become our love
May your screams never cease
You've taken the last of me
