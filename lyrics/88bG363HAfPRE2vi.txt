Really hate the running
Really hate the game
Looking at them all
I wanna be unborn again
Their suit is getting tighter
Although they're getting thin
The flies are crawling on their face and trying to get in
People say that we're to blame I say
No, no, no it's just the game

Must we let them fool us no, no, no
Have we got our freedom no, no, no
Is it getting better no, no, no
Do we love each other no, no, no
Must we wait forever no, no, no, no, no, no

Heads are getting stronger
Bodies getting weak
Looking at them all
It feels good to be a freak
Their hands are getting closer
They're reaching out so far
The greenies gonna get them make them serve stars
Tell them how it is and they say
No, no, no we know it all

Must we let them fool us no, no, no
Have we got our freedom no, no, no
Is it getting better no, no, no
Do we love each other no, no, no, no
Must we wait forever no, no, no, no, no

The washing's getting dirty
The air is getting thin
It's all in such a mess
That no one knows where to begin
They talk about creating
But all they do is kill
They say we're gonna mend it
But they never will
Poison in the rain but they say
No no no we ain't to blame

Must we let them fool us no, no, no
Have we got our freedom no, no, no
Is it getting better no, no, no
Do we love each other no, no, no
Must we wait forever no, no, no, no, no.
