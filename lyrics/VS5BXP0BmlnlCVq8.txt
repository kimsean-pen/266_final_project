I don't want nobody
You lift me up

Two more minutes and I'll be there
Filling my empty head
With pictures of you bare
A breath to take you home with me
Take your oxygen
Slowly while you breathe
And all the days in between
Still my drug of choice
The figure of my dreams
And though we wait
For now
Even through the noise
I feel you somehow

I don't want nobody else
You lift me off of the ground
I want you all to myself
Please, don't ever let me down

Two more minutes
And I won't care
That I broke my back today
Where all my people stare
'Cause once I'll get you in my arms
The ice will start to break
The day will fade away

I don't want nobody else
You lift me off of the ground
I want you all to myself
Please, don't ever let me down

And all the days in between
Still my drug of choice
The figure of my dreams

I don't want nobody else
You lift me off of the ground (You lift me off of the ground)
I want you all to myself (All to myself)
Please, don't ever let me down

I don't want nobody else (Oh-oh-oooh)
You lift me off of the ground (Oh-oh-oh)
I want you all to myself (Oh-oh-oooh)
Please don't ever let me down (Oh-oh-oh)
