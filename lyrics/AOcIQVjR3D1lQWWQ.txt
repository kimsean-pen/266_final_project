Well, you've got me working so hard lately
Working my hands until they bleed
If I was twice the man I could be
I'd still be half of what you need

Still you lead me and I follow
Anything you ask you know I'll do
This one act of consecration
Is what I ask of you

Ringfinger, promise carved in stone, deeper than the sea
Ringfinger, sever flesh and bone and offer it to me

Well, you just leave me nailed here
Hanging like Jesus on his cross
I'm just dying for your sins
And aiding to the cause

Ringfinger, promise carved in stone, deeper than the sea
Ringfinger, sever flesh and bone and offer it to me

Wrap my eyes in bandages
Confessions I see through
I get everything I want
When I get part of you
Ringfinger, promise carved in stone, deeper than the sea
Ringfinger, sever flesh and bone and offer it to me
Ringfinger, promise carved in stone, deeper than the sea
Ringfinger, devil's flesh and bone, do something for me
