Mickey Mouse is dead
Got kicked in the head
Cos people got too serious
They planned out what they said
They couldn't take the fantasy
Tried to accept reality
Analyzed the laughs
Cos pleasure comes in halves
The purity of comedy
They had to take it seriously
Changed the words around
Tried to make it look profound
The comedian is onstage
Pisstaking for a wage
The critics think he's great
But the laughter turns to hate

Mickey Mouse is on TV
And the kids stare at the screen
But the pictures are all black and white
And the words don't mean a thing
Cos Mummy's got no money
And daddy is in jail
He couldn't afford the license
She can't afford the bail, no

The kids out in the road
Their minds have all gone cold
Cos Mickey Mouse is dead
They shot him through the head
With ignorance and scorn
They believed in something new
They read the papers, watched the films
And thought they knew the truth

Look what you've done to Mickey Mouse

But reality deceives
Whatever you believe
There's always another idea
And theirs is based on fear
The fear of being sussed
For what they really are
The fear of being laughed at
When they go too far

They call it paranoia
You can't laugh it away
Until you come to realize
Everyone's the same
People hide their problems under faces of contempt
They hide 'em, till it kills 'em, and no one is exempt
Not even you

Look what you've done to Mickey Mouse
1, 2, 3, 4, look what you've done to Mickey Mouse
1, 2, 3, 4, can't you even laugh it away?
