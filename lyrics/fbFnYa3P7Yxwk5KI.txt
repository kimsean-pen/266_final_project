My dear, look at my face, I've been waiting for you in the same old place.
I've got a long time for love.
Jewels could spill from my cup.
But it's all locked down, and I'm all locked up.
I've got a long time for love.
A woman is not a girl.
I could show you a thing or two.
I've got a long time for love.
Come on let's go to the mat.
Hit the floor honey, let's battle it out.
I've got a long time for love.

Slow moves and dirty tricks
Want it like you never have
Timing and tiger strength
Strategy will put you past
Show me your darkest side
And you better be my bloody match

C'mon let's play a game.
It won't hurt just say my name
I've got a long time for love.
Roll the dice, take your card.
Let's see if your number's up.
I got a long time for love.
Pony up and try and guess my hand, what have I learned from
experience?
I've got a long time for love.
Let's call it my royal flush, I can show you what to do with it.
I've got along time for love.

Slow moves and dirty tricks
Want it like you never have
Timing and tiger strength
Strategy will put you past
Show me your darkest side
And you better be my bloody match
Let's call it love.

It's such a long time
I've wasted such a long time
Been such a long time
I've wasted all my smiling time

All. My. Life. I've. Wait-ted. For. A.

(Rest blocked out by Corin's orgasmic revving)

Let's call it love

My dear, look at my face, I've been waiting for you in the same old place.
I've got a long time for love.
My body is all shook up, like a bottle of pop and I wanna go off.
I've got a long time for love
Lock the door, lock it on up.
I wont let you go until I've had enough.
I've got a long time for love.
One thing, one more thing more before you go.
I've got a long time for love

Slow moves and dirty tricks
Want it like you never have
Timing and tiger strength
Strategy will put you past
Show me your darkest side
And you better be my bloody match
