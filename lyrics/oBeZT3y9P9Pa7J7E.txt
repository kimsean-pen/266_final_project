I wish I wasn't moving back from this
Cold heart from the weight of this
You will only get tired when you hold
Always moving, keep my heart from moving
And all this raging
Like a dream, I need everything to be at heart
I was holdin' up the real love
And let us leave as we forget it all
Because, you don't know what you've been lookin' for
You've got your feelings in the shadow, sh-shadow
You've got your feelings in the shadow, your shadow
I heard you think too many thoughts
You should know That everyone's a mess
And this place,
like a cave for fearing hearts If you
could dream, then you'd never fall apart
You ghost you don't know what you've been pushin' for
You've got your feelings in the shadow, sh-shadow
You've got your feelings in the shadow, your shadow
I feel things that I don't wanna feel
You've got faces that can't bleed
You've got those faces that can't bleed
You've got faces you don't need
You ghost
You will do your best to fall apart
You've got your feelings in the shadow, sh-shadow
You've got your feelings in the shadow, your shadow
I see your heart's been suffering the same
And you're so close now
You've got your feelings in the shadow, sh-shadow
You've got your feelings in your shadow
your shadow
