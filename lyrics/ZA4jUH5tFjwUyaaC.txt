When somebody reaches for your heart
Open up and let them through
'Cause everybody needs someone around
Things can tumble down on you

You'll discover when you look around
You don't have to be alone
Just one lover is all you need to know
When you're feeling all alone

You might need somebody
You might need somebody too
(You might need somebody too)
You might need somebody
You might need somebody too
(You might need somebody too)

If there is fire stolen in your heart
And you're sure it's wrong and right
Keep it burning through the cold and I
It can warm your lonely nights

You might need somebody
You might need somebody too
(You might need somebody too)
You might need somebody
You might need somebody too
(You might need somebody too)

You might need somebody
You might need somebody too
(You might need somebody too)
You might need somebody
You might need somebody too
(You might need somebody too)

You might need somebody too
(Need somebody)
You might need somebody
No, I'll need somebody, no, I'll do

You might need somebody too
You might need somebody too
Need somebody
Need somebody
