It takes time to blow
Say it ain't so
Stuck in the middle of it
Two words to know
Oh here we go
We grow so used to it

Soon among the time
How had we become so empty?

It's over-complicated
And we're all to blame
Over-saturated
And it's such a shame

It's all who you know
Got time to tell
We all fall victim to it
All chemical
Why have we gone?
Oh we're just used to it

Soon among the time
How had we become so empty?

It's over-complicated
And we're all to blame
Over-saturated
And it's such a shame
When we can not feel
How can we heal at all?
If we're over-medicated
Then we're all to blame

Here we are
Once again
How'd we get here?
Will it end?

Look at you lost with separation
Complicated
There's no one left to blame
You're just a shell of a man left wasted
Medicated
I'm standing on the outside looking in

It's over-complicated
And we're all to blame
Over-saturated
And it's such a shame
When we can not feel
How can we heal at all?
If we're over-medicated
Then we're all to blame
