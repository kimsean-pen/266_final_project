It's dark
It's cold
My mind is not my home

It's dark
It's cold
My mind is not my home

It makes me sick to know I have voices in my head
I lost my mind before I knew what it meant to be sane
Give me more time
When did I cross the line
I want a reason I want an answer
I want a reason someday
I want a reason I want an answer
I want a reason now

How am I standing here?

What is the message?
What are the chances that I'll be living tomorrow?
There is progression
I'm still standing here
I'm gonna hold my head up high before I'm dead in the dirt

Sickness and business do mix as well as you'd think
Freedom and wisdom I need you to keep me clean
Give me new life
This noose is getting way to tight

I want a reason I want an answer
I want a reason someday
I want a reason I want an answer
I want a reason now

But I'm still standing here

What is the message?
What are the chances that I'll be living tomorrow?
There is progression
I'm still standing here
I'm gonna hold my head up high before I'm dead in the dirt

Relapse relapsing
Detox detoxing
I've gotta be better than this

What is the message?
What are the chances that I'll be living tomorrow?
There is progression
I'm still standing here
I'm gonna hold my head up high before I'm dead in the dirt

Relapse relapsing
Detox detoxing
