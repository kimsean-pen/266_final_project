All you really want from me
Is to stay closer
But it's only getting harder for me
To see
The more we understand who we are
as we get older
And my hearts telling me
(oohh) That baby it's over
But the fear won't let me leave
So we only get closer

I never meant this to take me over
But in the moment we were so in love
So you let me go once
But twice is way harder
Now you're only holding on so i won't let go

All you really want from me
Is to stay closer
But it's only getting harder for me
To see
The more we understand who we are
As we get older
And my hearts saying leave
Yet we're only getting closer
Yeah we're only getting closer we
(Know that it's over)

Painting faces just to mix it up now
changing places still we're feeling stuck
Hold you close just to spare emotion
It's like the ghost of what could be
So you let me go once
But twice is way harder
Now you're only holding on so i won't let go

All you really want from me
Is to stay closer
But it's only getting harder for me
To see
The more we understand who we are
As we get older
And my hearts saying leave
Yet we're only getting closer
Yeah we're only getting closer we
Both know that it's over

(Yeah we're only getting closer)
(Yeah we're only getting closer we)
(Both know that it's over)
