Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah

My dear, it's true
You're trouble just like me
We're black and blue
And in love with misery.
But you can have my darkness
You can have my black dress

Take away my emo
I don't really need this
I'm getting in my own way
Getting high on heartbreak

And all the shit that you say
It's making my world all grey
I don't wanna stay here
'Cause every day it rains here

Underneath a clear blue sky
Even though it's summer
All I hear is thunder
Underneath this clear blue sky
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Don't blame yourself
I let you drag me down
But this place is hell

I finally see that now
So you can have my dark clouds
Gotta let my hurt down
Take away my emo

I think I've had enough now
Of getting in my own way
And getting high on heartbreak
And all the shit that you say
It's making my world all grey
I don't wanna stay here

'Cause every day it rains here
Underneath a clear blue sky
Even though it's summer
All I hear is thunder

Underneath this clear blue sky
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
But I'm not saying that I'm gonna start going to church
Not saying that I should pull it to work

Just saying for once, I'm putting myself first
Putting myself first, putting myself first
So I'm leaving this town for good
God, I gotta get out of this neighborhood
Just like you never ever thought I could
Never thought I could, never thought that...
I don't wanna stay here
'Cause every day it rains here
Underneath a clear blue sky
Even though it's summer
All I hear is thunder
Underneath this clear blue sky
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
