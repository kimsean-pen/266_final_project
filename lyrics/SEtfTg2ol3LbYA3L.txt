I'm giving up, this whole lie is on me
Call it out like a family
Instead I bide my time, get a ride
Until the rubber leaves the road
You said don't lie so I made the truth
Seem like a lie to even you
Control your fear, its clear
That you do not know where you're going to
So don't you woo-oo-oo-oo-oorry
You will be my resolution
Characters of no illusion
You will be my resolution
One month down and it's in sight
Oh I'm guaranteed to lose my mind
It's dangerous to speak and sigh
You might know what I'm trying to hide
So from the cradle to quarter age
Oh I bought the book but didn't flip the page
Ohhhh, readiness is near, we steer-ah ah!
As far away from the coming of days
So don't you woo-oo-oo-oo-oorry
You will be my resolution
Characters of no illusion
You will be my resolution
Characters of no illusion
You will be my resolution

Woo woo woooo
Turn around put it down and see
That this is really the place to be
I'm not you, nor you me
But we're both moving steady
