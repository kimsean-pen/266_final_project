I can tell you I've been chained forever
Only in my dreams
I can be free and feel much better
I'd be running right into your arms
Away from the dark

Just take my hand and lift me up
Where you and me will never stop
When I need you, I feel you, I see you
Release me from here
Do not fear

I sense your spirit over me
You fight a war and bleed for me
To be healed and released and relieved
To be free over here
Do not fear

Since you're gone I feel so lost and shattered
Help from above
It's the only way that really matters
Send an angel, send a light to me
Then I'm gonna be free

Just take my hand and lift me up
Where you and me will never stop
When I need you, I feel you, I see you
Release me from here
Do not fear

I sense your spirit over me
You fight a war and bleed for me
To be healed and released and relieved
To be free over here
Do not fear

And I feel so alone over here
Feel so far from you
But I know you can taste every tear
Fall for you
Fall for you

Just take my hand and lift me up
Where you and me will never stop
When I need you, I feel you, I see you
Release me from here
Do not fear

I sense your spirit over me
You fight a war and bleed for me
To be healed and released and relieved
To be free over here
