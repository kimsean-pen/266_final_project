I see your lips move
All of the sound
Working against you
Your voice is too loud
Just let me kiss you for now
Don't you know that
You already got me

Ah ooh all of your words
Only say so much
And it's not enough
Ah ooh touch me
Tonight like the only one
Like I'm all you want

Excuse my language
Just shut your mouth
I don't need another
Minute with your talking
Don't use your language
Just use your mouth
And show me how you
Feel with your body
Excuse my language

Let's take it home now
Mm what you say
Let's be alone now
Don't hesitate
I wanna hit mute for now
Don't you know
That you already got me

Ah ooh all of your
Words only say so much
And it's not enough
Ah ooh touch me
Tonight like the only one
Like I'm all you want

Excuse my language
Just shut your mouth
I don't need another
Minute with your talking
Don't use your language
Just use your mouth
And show me how
You feel with your body
Excuse my language

You talk too much and
All your words are wasted
All I really wanna hear you say is
Say it, say it, say it
