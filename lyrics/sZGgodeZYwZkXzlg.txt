Lay down where the medals weep
... I heard the thoughts that we dare not speak
Like wicked words amongst the trees
old promises that we could not keep
And when the... of time
and the trumpet softly blows
Play a song inside my mind
and i'll have to let it go
Wind decay broke our bones
Left in here nowhere to belong
years go by wrapped in a coated blue
snow fell down on the avenue
When the hangmen reached the gallows
Then the trumpet softly blow
Play a song so full of sorrows
Then I'll have to let it go
Lay me down where the medals weep
I heard the thoughts that we dare not speak
When the day came to a close
I cut the rope and let it go
It's all ... in the darkness
And the trumpet softly blows
Play a song full of sadness
Then I had to let it go
