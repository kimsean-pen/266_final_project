dirty old town, dirty old town,
they've got all your little problems clearly written down.
you don't even know, don't even see
the butterfly that you're going to be,
the butterfly that you are becoming.

all the road, all the miles,
hair goes grey, eyes stay wide.
come to bed, turn off the lights
fall asleep inside of you. you're the one,

you're the one.
hearts grow into hearts until hearts become one.
you're the one, you're the one.
i carry you heart in my heart sung with every song.

poised with grace in this poisoned place.
how you ever manage to keep it off your face.
you don't even know, don't even see
the butterfly that you're going to be,
the butterfly you are becoming.
