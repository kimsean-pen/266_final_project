If you don't want me, you can't have me
I'm not the kind of guy who likes to hang around
If you can't trust me, walk right past me
That doesn't mean that I wouldn't settle down

'Cause I got a lotta love
Got a lotta love
Got a lotta love to give
Got a lotta love
Got a lotta love
Got a lotta love to give

Do you remember when we first met?
Can we make it feel the way it back then?
It was real love, I didn't dream it
All I know is that I want it back again

'Cause I got a lotta love
Got a lotta love
Got a lotta love to give
Got a lotta love
Got a lotta love
Got a lotta love to give

'Cause I got a lotta love
Got a lotta love
Got a lotta love to give
Got a lotta love
Got a lotta love
Got a lotta love to give
