I'm sorry I almost, started taking things too serious,
I got so caught up in, a thinking binge and let life take over.
And let life take over.
And let life take over.

Time's been fluttering by and I can't keep track of it,
Every moment decides how my intelligence rests.
I've been trying to be something different
away from the automatic existences.
