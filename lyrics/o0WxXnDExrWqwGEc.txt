Though the water boils
Don't turn off the heat
Can't find the spoon that we have had
The sugar cubes will melt no more

We belong as two together
We belong as two together

How can you take my soul?
Stop...
I need a new beat
Can't find the spoon that we have had
The sugar cubes will melt no more

We belong as two together
We belong as two together
