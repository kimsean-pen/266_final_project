The weekend comes to this town
Seven days too soon
For the ones who have to make up
What we break up of their rules

Well, I saw Captain Kidd on Sunset
Tell his boys they're in command
While Chino danced a Tango
With a broomstick in his hand

He said,"It's alright"
(Alright)
If you have a good time
It's alright
(Alright)
If you want to cross that line
Break on through to the other side

(Let it rock)
Let it rock
(Let it go)
Let it go
You can't stop a fire burning out of control

Let it rock
(Let it rock)
Let it go
(Let it go)
With the night you're on the loose,

You gotta let it rock
(Whoa, oh, ohh)
(Whoa, oh, oh-oh)
We go down to the Broadway

Where everybody goes
To get upon their rockin' horse
And blast that radio
Yeah, I saw Roxie on the table

Her girlfriend down below
They'll give it up to the King of Swing
Before it's time to go
It's alright
(Alright)
If you have a good time
It's alright

(Alright)
If you want to cross that line
Break on through to the other side
(Let it rock)
Let it rock

(Let it go)
Let it go
You can't stop a fire burning out of control
Let it rock
(Let it rock)

Let it go
(Let it go)
You can't stop a fire burning out of control
Let it rock
(Let it rock)
Let it go

(Let it go)
It's with the night when all are loose
You gotta let it rock
(Let it rock)
Let it rock
(Let it go)
Let it go
You can't stop a fire burning out of control
(Let it rock)
Let it rock
(Let it go)
Let it go
With the night when we're on the loose
Said,"Everybody, sing!"
(Whoa, oh, oh)
(Whoa, oh, oh-oh)
