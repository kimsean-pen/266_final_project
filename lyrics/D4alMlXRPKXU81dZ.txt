Sunlight failed
But only for a while
In the moonlight pale
Someone made me smile

The shining almost took me
But I made it through that night
And in the morning life it graced me
And I ran for miles into sunlight

In a billion dreams that are lost and won
And moonlight in spite of all you've seen
There's only one way out
Say you will love me until I leave the world
