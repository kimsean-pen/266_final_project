The time is too short
but never too long
to reach ahead,
to project the image,
which will in time become a concrete dream.
Another cigarette,
another day,
from A to B,
again avoiding C, D, and E,
'cause E is where you play the blues.
Avoiding a death
is to win the game,
to avoid relegation,
the big E.

Drowning in the big swim,
rising to the surface
The smell of you
That's the lowdown
