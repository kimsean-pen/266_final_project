What you think is freedom
Isn't where your choice goes
And now you fear everything
There's lost years and more wars to go
I guess it's so typical because nothing's getting done

In a ditch with a shovel
In a bombed out space where the roads need fuel to survive
If the fog caves in
We're discovered

They'll never tell you about the plans of the few
They promised it to
They're not like you
And they'll never serve you

When arson plays its role
There's an unarmed maniac to chase you home
It must've been rendered sentimental
Maniac
Uncomfortable you head that way
To rise up and break your fall
A native tongue will hold you
Let's hope so
Uncomfortable you head the way
To rise up and break your fall
Say you will look and find it soon

Go ahead, you save yourself
Formulate and save yourself

My own way of systems
Often sold to nations
Sorrow, amelioration
Attention, Jupiter
My own way of systems sold to nations

In a ditch with a shovel
In a bombed out space where the roads need fuel to survive
If the fog caves in
We're discovered

They'll never tell you about the plans of the few
They promised it to
They're not like you
And they'll never serve you

When arson plays its role
There's an unarmed maniac to chase you home
It must've been rendered sentimental

Maniac
