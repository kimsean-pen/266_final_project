If I may be so bold that I just say something,
Come and make me my day,
The clouds around your soul,
Don't gather there for nothing,
But I can chase them all away,
Why d'you need a reason for to feel happy,
Or shining for the rest of the world,
Give me just a smile and would you make it snappy,
Get your shit together girl,
You've got a feeling lost inside you,
Just won't let you go.

Your life is sneaking up behind,
It just wont let you go,
No it just wont let you go,
Is what I'm trying to say.

Is would you maybe,
Come dance with me,
'Cause to me it doesn't matter,
If your hopes and dreams are shattered,

When you say something,
You make me believe,
Yeah, the girl who wears a dirty shirt,
She knows exactly what she's worth,
She knows exactly what she's worth to me,
But I can see, I can see.

If you ever find yourself inside a bubble,
You gotta make your own way home,
You can call me anytime your seeing double,
Now you know your not alone,

You've got a feeling lost inside you,
Just won't let you go,

Your life is sneaking up behind,
It just wont let you go,
No it just wont let you go,
Is what I'm trying to say.

Is won't you maybe,
Come dance with me,
'Cause to me it doesn't matter
If your hopes and dreams are shattered
When you say something,
You make me believe,
You're the girl who wears a dirty shirt,

Maybe she'll come dance with me,
'Cause to me it doesn't matter
If her hopes and dreams are shattered,
When she says something,
She'll make me believe,

You're the girl who wears a dirty shirt
She knows exactly what she's worth,
She knows exactly what she's worth to me,
She knows exactly what she's worth to me,
She knows exactly what she's worth to me,

Now I can see,
Now I see,
Now I see,
Now I see,
Now I see,
Now I see,
Now I see,
Now I see.
