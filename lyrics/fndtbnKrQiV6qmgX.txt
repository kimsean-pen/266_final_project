It's worse, worse than you think,
If truth be told,
I'll tell you that you're lovesick,
I am sweet, so everybody takes a bite,
Dig in, I'm the catalyst of your demise.
Words are cheap so I'll sell you a line,
Like the way you acted that night,
Second best, is what, what you want then,
It won't cost that much, but me.

I've got you hanging on every word I say,
But that don't mean a thing,
And you love the way I take your breath away,
So I'll take your breath away.

Have you had, had your day?
Move close, and I'll push you away.
Play it safe,
For the sake of keeping some face,
Play it safe,
In the name of keeping your place.
Do what, what I tell you to,
With arms we'll carry this through,
Can't wait, can't wait to see you.

I've got you hanging on every word I say,
But that don't mean a thing,
And you love the way I take your breath away,
So I'll take, take, take.

Oh I only have eyes for you,
And it's so true.
Oh I only have eyes for you,
It's the truth, it's the truth.
So true.
So true.
So true.
So true.

And I only have eyes for you,
And I only have eyes for you.

I've got you hanging on every word I say,
But that don't mean a thing,
And you love the way I take your breath away,
So I'll take, take, take.

Oh I only have eyes for you,
And it's so true.
Oh I only have eyes for you,
It's the truth, it's the truth.
So true.
