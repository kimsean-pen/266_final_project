I don't need nobody, no, I, I don't need nobody
Oh, I don't need nobody to be alone,
To be alone

And in the darkness a shallow voice
And it hears all
I bite my tongue, there's a fever,
I will not let it go

I don't need nobody, no, I, I don't need nobody
Oh, I don't need nobody to be alone,
To be alone

And in the darkness a shallow voice
And it hears all
I bite my tongue, there's a fever,
I will not let it show

And in the darkness a shallow voice
And it hears all
I bite my tongue, there's a fever,
I will not let it show.

I don't need nobody, no, I, I don't need nobody
Oh, I don't need nobody to be alone,
To be alone, to be alone
