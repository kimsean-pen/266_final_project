At sunrise the village
Is already wide awake
Behold!
Everything is ready for the feast
Perfumed wreaths of flowers
Hung on every balcony

Look up!
The streets are decked with colorful festoons
The square will look beautiful
Dressed in sparkling lights
At dusk, when the music begins

In this celebration in honor of the Supreme
The folks build parade floats glorifying his name
The lord's young and beautiful children
Lork and Eirene rejoice and hop around
The pageant holding hands
They taste all the candy they get from every stand
Then dash through the gardens and fields

Swear won't peek
When we play hide and seek
Just count to ten and come find me!
I am the guard and you are the thief
You'll never enter my castle!
I wanna run
I will race you for fun
Who makes it first to the rainbow?
Brotherly love, high on fantasy's wings
I'm happy when we we're together

Swear won't peek
When we play hide and seek
(Please don't cheat)
Just count to ten and come find me!
(Olly olly oxen free)
I am the guard and you are the thief
You'll never enter my castle!
(I won't let you)
I wanna run
I will race you for fun
(Come chase me)
Who makes it first to the rainbow?
(I bet you can't beat me dear)
Brotherly love, high on fantasy's wings
I'm happy when we're together

I wanna run
I will race you for fun
Who makes it first to the rainbow?
Brotherly love, high on fantasy's wings
I'm happy when we're together
