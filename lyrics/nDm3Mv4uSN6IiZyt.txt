Like a West Side Story I was meant to love you
Turns out that the wrong man is the one man
Making me feel like a woman

You're a Casanova, you steal those kisses, don't you?
Yeah, I know that we have love but it's bad love
Isn't it kind of mad that I want you?

The music's playing out for us, so darling

You can play me like a Spanish guitar
Hold me like you'll never let me go, darling
You can play me like a Spanish guitar
Play me 'til I'm begging you for more

And on the streets of heartache, that's where I know I'll find you
I've been waiting such a long time, always the wrong time
Isn't it the right time to love you?

And I don't need to know you 'cause I already know your kind
You don't want to fall for a lifetime, baby if you don't mind
We can take risk for one night

So you can play me like a Spanish guitar
Hold me like you'll never let me go, darling
You can play me like a Spanish guitar
Play me 'til I'm begging you for more

Hasta que me vuelva loca
Hasta que me vuelva loca
Play me 'til I'm begging you for more
Hasta que me vuelva loca
Hasta que me vuelva loca
Play me 'til I'm begging you for more, darling

Kiss me hard, I wanna hear the music playing
Loose control before we loose it all

You can play me like a Spanish guitar
Hold me like you'll never let me go, darling
You can play me like a Spanish guitar
Play me 'til I'm begging you for more

Hasta que me vuelva loca
Hasta que me vuelva loca
Play me 'til I'm begging you for more
Hasta que me vuelva loca
Hasta que me vuelva loca
Play me 'til I'm begging you for more

Hasta que me vuelva loca
Hasta que me vuelva loca
You can play me on the floor
Besame toda la boca
Hasta que me vuelva loca
You can play me on the floor
