Sunrise and the new day's breakin' through
The morning of another day without you
And as the hours roll by, no one's there to see me cry
Except the sunrise, the sunrise and you

Tired eyes drift across the shore
Looking for love and nothing more
But as the sea rolls by, no one's there to see me cry
Except the sunrise, the sunrise and you

Sunrise
Bless my eyes
Catch my soul
Make me whole again

Sunrise, new day, hear my song
I'm tired of fighting and fooling around
But from now till who knows when
My sword will be my friend
And I'll love you, love you
For all of my time

Sunrise
Bless my eyes
Catch my soul
And make me whole again

Sunrise
Bless my eyes
Catch my soul
Make me whole again

Sunrise
Bless my eyes
Catch my soul
Make me whole again

Sunrise
