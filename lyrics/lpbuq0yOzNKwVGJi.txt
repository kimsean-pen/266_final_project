I feel the morning coming over.
But if you stay you can leave with me.
I'll tell you everything I know.
Nowhere left to be.

Rain is falling in the corner.
Above the boys and the moonlit mask.
Just be a shoulder for my head.
All I ever ask.

Annie left me to the lions.
I took a pill and she took my friends.
But there is something right with you.
Nevermind the end, nevermind the end, nevermind the end.

Take me away from here.
Somewhere we can just disappear.
I'll be your morning light.
If you wanna be my ride tonight.

All I ever ask, all I ever ask, all I ever ask.
