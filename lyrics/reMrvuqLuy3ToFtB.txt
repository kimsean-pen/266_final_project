There's people downstairs
I'm more than a fighter you know

There's people downstairs
It wasn't even yours to share

I know you're old
Heavy hand takes hold

Television's too loud
He leaves without a sound

And I know you're old
Heavy hand takes hold

There's people downstairs
I stole it from a letter
Off your tongue it rolled

Sheltered from the weather
You could be so bold

You told me it'd get better
And I know you're old

There's people downstairs
I'm more than a fighter you know

Heavy hand takes hold
And I know you're old

There's people downstairs
There's people downstairs
There's people downstairs

I'm more than a fighter
I'm more than a fighter you know
There's people downstairs
