Woke up feeling bad again
The window always shows me where I am
But now darkness won't allow me to show you who I am
Maybe it's the light either way I do not know

Arizona, I wanna go there
Pacific Ocean, I wanna go there
The memory of a life scattered shy the tideless sea
Well the deepest is death and we are fluent, words nothing

Catskill Mountains I will always come back to you
Mom, I love you, I still hear your voice inside my sleep
Next time you see me I'll be glowing brightly
Outside with the birds in the middle of the yard

What a place, what a place for us
Forest fields, ocean lakes, and the stars
But I said nothing and it's just because I like
The sound

I just want love, I just want sun, I just want your company
Silhouettes of the mountain in the dark
Is there anything more beautiful than afternoon?
But quiet summer nights while the rainstorm gently cries
