True love to true love
And rust to rust
I let the others cast stones
While I drew in the dust
I tried to be a good man
Something changes in the wind
I got that old black magic rolling in

Wave upon wave now
Here come the dreams
And I can't see the lighthouse
And the lighthouse can't scream
Don't you know I need you so bad
Tell me where the hell you been
I got that old black magic rolling in

Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling in

I can't sleep for crying
I'm crying all the time
Everybody's got an angel
I got mine
Wings of a crow
Overshadowin'
I got that old black magic rolling in

Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling in

I know the way it goes down
It's all in my head
I feel it rising
From its unmarked bed
Sure not the devil
Sure not his friend
But I know for sure
What's rolling in

You never asked for fire
You already were a thief
So I knew you'd be with me
When I need you to be
Steal my soul honey
Keep it for me when
I got that old black magic rolling in

Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling in

There was a time I knew ya
You knew me
There was nothing in between us
Far as we could see
Don't you know I need my true love
My truest friend
I got that old black magic rolling in

Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling in
Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling in
