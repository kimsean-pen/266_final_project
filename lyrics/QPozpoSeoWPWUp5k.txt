You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever

You and me on the hood of my car
Saturday night, watching the stars
You and me on the hood of my car
Saturday night, watching the stars
You and I, shinning lights to what we are
Look at the sky and I am never far

I can be right there next to you
No matter where in the world you are
I got you right here next to me
Forever connected through the stars
It's what we are

You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever

The last train's gone, we walk through the night
The moon shines down like a spotlight
The last train's gone, we walk through the night
The moon shines down like a spotlight
You and I, shinning lights to what we are
Look at the sky and I am never far

I can be right there next to you
No matter where in the world you are
I got you right here next to me
Forever connected through the stars
It's what we are

You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever

You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever

I can be right there next to you
Forever connected through the stars
It's what we are

You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever

You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
You and me together, stars forever
