I wanna get lost with you
It doesn't matter where we're going, oh
Just read the signs
As long as it's somewhere new
A thousand miles from NY and I still look at you

We're passing through time with our airline wine
Side by side
Lonely for small talk, oh, just recline your head in mine

Kicking back to the morning light
Wake up and see what we'll find
Every moment with you, sublime
Oh, don't it feel right?
Kicking back to the morning light
Wake up and see what we'll find
Every moment with you, sublime
Oh, don't it feel right?

Oh, don't it feel right?
Oh, don't it feel right?
Oh, don't it feel right?
Oh, don't it feel right?

We're up here alone
It's just you and I and countless colors of the sky
Do we have to go?
Can we stay up on this ride and go round one more time?
Hey, yeah

We're passing through time with our airline wine
Side by side
Lonely for small talk, oh, just recline your head in mine

Kicking back to the morning light
Wake up and see what we'll find
Every moment with you, sublime
Oh, don't it feel right?
Kicking back to the morning light
Wake up and see what we'll find
Every moment with you, sublime
Oh, don't it feel right?

Oh, don't it feel right?
Oh, don't it feel right?
Oh, don't it feel right?
Oh, don't it feel right?

Too high on love
Will you keep your promise?
You're all I know
If I'm being honest
Too high on love
Will you keep your promise?
You're all I know
If I'm being, if I'm being
Oh, if I'm being honest
Will you keep your promise? (Hey)
If I'm being honest (Hey)
Will you keep your promise?
Oh, don't it feel right?
Oh, don't it feel right?
