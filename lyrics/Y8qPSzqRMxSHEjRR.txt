I've been used
But I'm takin' it like a man
I'm confused
But I'm doin' the best that I can

I've been tossed around plenty before
I've had this heart of mine broken and more
I can't find a reason for sure
But I've gotten used to bad news
(Oh can't find me a reason for sure)

Don't tell me why
Yes it's over I can see the end
But please don't lie
If you're leavin' me like a friend

I've been tossed around plenty of times
And I've read between all the lines
You're just another in the grand design
And I've gotten used to bad news, yeah yeah

I know what you're sayin' is bad
It's not what I wanted, but I'm ready for that
I'm ready for that, yeah

I've been used
But I'm takin' it like a man
I'm confused
But I'm doin' the best that I can

I've been tossed around plenty before
I've had this heart of mine broken and more
(I can't find a reason)I can't find a reason for sure
But I've gotten used to bad news
I've gotten used to bad news
I've gotten used to bad news
I've gotten used to bad news yeah
