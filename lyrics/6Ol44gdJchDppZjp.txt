In the sweet old country
Where I come from
Nobody ever works
Nothing ever gets done
We hang fire, we hang fire
You know marrying
Money is a full time job
I don't need the aggravation
I'm a lazy slob, I hang fire
I hang fire, hang fire, hang
Put it on the wire, baby
I hang fire, hang fire
Put it on the wire, baby
I hang fire
We got nothing to eat
We go nowhere to work
Nothing to drink
We just lost our shirt
I'm on the dole, we ain't for hire
Say, What the hell? Say, What the hell?
Hang fire, hang fire, hang fire
Put it on the wire baby
Hang fire, hang fire, hang fire
Hang fire, hang fire, hang fire
Put it on the wire baby
Hang fire, hang fire, hang fire
Hang fire, hang fire, hang fire
Put it on the wire baby
Yeah, take a thousand dollars
Go and have some fun
Put it all on at a hundred to one
Hang fire, I hang fire, hang fire
Put it on the wire baby
Hang fire, hang fire, put it on the wire baby
Hang fire, hang fire, hang fire, hang fire
Put it on the wire baby
Put it on the wire baby
