You and me forever -- we belong together.
And we'll always endeavor throughout any type of weather.

You want everything to be just like (x2)
The stories that you read but never write. (x2)
You gotta learn to live, and live and learn.
You gotta learn to give, and wait your turn,
Or you'll get burned.

You wrote our names down on the sidewalk,
But the rain came and washed them off.
So we should write them again on wet cement,
So people a long time from now will know what we meant.

You want every morning to be just like (x2)
The stories that you read but you never write. (x2)
You gotta learn to live, and live and learn.
You gotta learn to give, and wait your turn.
I'm only concerned.

I'm adding something new to the mixture,
So there's a different hue to your picture.
A different ending to this fairy tale,
With no sunset into which we sail.

You want everything to be just like (x2)
The stories that you read but you can't write.
You gotta learn to live, and live and learn.
Oh, you gotta learn to give and wait your turn,
Or you'll get burned.
