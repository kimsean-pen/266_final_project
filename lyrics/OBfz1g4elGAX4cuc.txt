If all that we are wishing for is poison, poison is part of love
She will hold you until the sunrise
Poison will only break your heart

So Hallelujah, the night has come
If it's a riot how far do you go now?
Back to square one, hitting the glass
If it's a riot then how long how long do you let it run?

If all that we are wishing for is poison, poison is path of love
She will hold you until the sunrise
Poison will only break your heart

If your're looking for love, beware the signs
They will paralyse you one by one
It's there in the stars, the system's strong
But when the battery's gone then how how long have we got to run?

If all that we are wishing for is poison, poison is part of love
She will hold you until the sunrise
Poison will only break your heart

Love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is, love ah
Love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love is, love ah

If all that we are wishing for is poison, poison is part of love
She will hold you until the sunrise
Poison will only break your heart
