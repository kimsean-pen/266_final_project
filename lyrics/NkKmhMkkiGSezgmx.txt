I don't have any answers
I'm not short on questions anymore
Still choosing lost causes,
Defending battles and hopeless wars

With the right heart
Wrong decision
Keeps you blinded
Tunnel vision
Oh the road to
Love is paved with good intentions

And I'm still getting to the good part
The breaking down
Learning how to write my story
And I'm in the middle of the madness
The living loose
Finding who I'm gonna be
From the start til the end
I'm still learning the road between

I'm gonna need to borrow patience
A shot of courage for letting go
Rent a little wisdom
Until I can afford my own

With the right heart
Wrong decision
Going slower
Tunnel vision
Oh the road to
Love is paved with good intentions

And I'm still getting to the good part
The breaking down
Learning how to write my story
And I'm in the middle of the madness
The living loose
Finding who I'm gonna be
From the start til the end
I'm still learning the road between

And I know it ain't gonna be easy, no
But I'm a fighter and you can't take that from me, no
This is just a page in the chapter I'm in

And I'm still getting to the good part
The breaking down
Learning how to write my story

And I'm in the middle of the madness
The living loose
Finding who I'm gonna be
From the places I've been
To wherever I'll go
From the start til the end
I'm still learning the road between
