Hello?

Phone steady ringing off the hip now (Hello?)
They like "Heard you got that work
Chicken with the jerk, ho that twerk" (Nah)
Phone steady ringing off the hip now (Hello?)
They like "Heard you got a mil'
Got up out that deal, how it feel?"

Yeah, making a move or two
Just to look at what these moves'll do
Caddy-corner, corner pocket the bills
Bought a foreign just to go with the grill
Flip a coin just to blow off a mil'
Need a hiking trip to get where I live
Might hop in a Lear, take a flight to the Sip'
Just to check on the family, then back in this bitch
Just to mack on a bitch with immaculate tits on the low-low
Bitch, I'm selfish, the foreign ain't four-door
Bitch, I'm selfish, no I don't need no ho
Han Solo on the creep
Keep a Georgia with a peach
Split the middle for the feast
Fold the money, never crease
Keep it poppin' like some grease
Going broke is for the weak
Phone ringing off the hip now
Hit them haters with the missed call
Same number since Kobe balled
Shoulda changed that shit a year ago
Phone ringing off the hip now
Hit that bitch with the missed call
Now she wanting me digging in her walls
Should've let me hit a year ago

(Glorious)
How it feel?
(Glorious)
How it feel?
(Glorious)
H-how it feel?
(Glorious)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
How it feel?

Uh, buy what I wanna, life of a loner
Keep a rider like Winona
Sitting on chrome, ignoring my phone
Like where was they when I was homeless?
Now I got whip appeal, now I got chips to deal
Talking million dollar goals on porcelain thrones
With heated floors, ain't shit to live
Toss it up, boss it up, look what it cost ya
Awful, mmm, chalk it up
I lost ya, look how I crossed ya
Crawford, mmm
On the court for a win, hustle and grind 'til it blend
She take it, she take it all on her chin
I came with no heart like the Tin Man from Wiz, fin
Foreign, back from the touring
Y'all shit was boring, sorry I'm snoring
Liquor was pouring, champagne is popping, change up decor, and
Broke on the chorus, sip with a syrup for walking on water
Drip like a snorter, color me bad, stay in the borders, bitch
