It's cold at night
The days are getting hotter than hell
Devoid of change
And never seen a drop of rain
Dead-end life
All alone
What I want I'll never know
Running round
Chasing gold
In a desert there's no rainbows

I've been searching my whole life
Aging like a rancid wine
Decades on a pointless grind
Opportunity declined

There's hurdles in my progression
Had to mutate my flaws to survive a
Dead-end life
All alone
What I want I'll never know
Running round
Chasing gold
In a desert there's no rainbows

Was everything I built worth the time
All I ever knew was the grind
My Legacy in stone I'll never see
Rainbows never shine around me

Anyone here anymore
Guess I'll show myself the door
Solitude is my decor
Finding fate is my cold war
Rainbows never shine around me
