Yet another early morning and you walking like its nothing
Hold up, hold up, hold tight
Ain't no donuts ain't no coffee
See i know you seen me callin and callin
I should crack ya right in ya forehead

Let me take a breathe (Let me take a breathe)
And regain my composure
Told you one more time (Told you one more time)
If you f'd up its over.
When its gone, its gone, its gone, its gone, its gone
You dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong
So just scoo do do doot baby

Its a wrap for you baby (It's a wrap)
Its a wrap for you boy (It's a wrap)
Oh baby

If I ever misrepresented my self-image
Then I'm sorry
I was oh so acquiescent
But I learn my lesson
Boy you sorry
Bump, bump, bump
All out in the open
Dont make me go call maury provich

Let me take a breathe (Let me take a breathe)
And regain my composure
Told you one more time (Told you one more time)
If you f'd up its over.
When its gone, its gone, its gone, its gone, its gone
You dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong
So just scoo do do doot baby

Its a wrap for you baby (It's a wrap)
Its a wrap for you boy (It's a wrap)
Oh baby

Put all of your shit in the elevator
Its going down like a denominator
Trying to keep holding on, holding on
Boy let me go
You gonna wake my neighbors, get away from my door
That was your last shot you ain't coming back
Its the martini I mean it baby
It's a wrap

When its gone, its gone, its gone, its gone
You dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong,
so wrong, so wrong (you dead wrong)
So just scoo do do doot baby
Boy I ain't playing a game.
I told you, I told you
If you f'd up one more time its over (It's wrap)
So get out of my face it's over
Been sitting here all night leave me alone.
Since 1 o'clock A.M. been drinking patron
Let the credits role, its a wrap
