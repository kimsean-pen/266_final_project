Amity, Amity, Amity, Amity, Amity, Amity, Amity caught stars
In her arms
Hello, Hello Kitty happy in New York City
Amity walking like a lucky
Charm

I'm a neon sign and I stay open all the time
So let's go, go, go, go

Amity Amity God don't make no
Junk but it's plain to see
He still made me
He told me so
I'm good to go
I'm ready to go

'Cause you laugh and talk
And 'cause you
Make my world rock
I'm so, so, so, so

Amity, Amity, Amity, Amity, Amity, Amity, Amity good to go
