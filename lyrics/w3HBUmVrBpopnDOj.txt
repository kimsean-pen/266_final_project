Night, that fateful raven alighted
On the cusp of my bewitchment

The beast in the clouds had swallowed the moon
A silverback thundering across the cosmos
In silence now stars followed her tune
Winking from existence on the brink of chaos
I penned an open sonnet, to the pearly gates ablaze
As i gazed upon this angel intoxicating everything

The ball became her court, her presence there electrifying
Candelabra fought, to tear themselves away

She was a flame, divine
My pathic call of duty, irrefutable
Her eyes they paralyzed me, froze the flow of time
A glimpse so achingly beautiful

Fleeing from the manor in the manner of this crime
We sheltered from the pelting, helter-skelter of the skies
In the Greek gazebo, speaking tragedian rhyme
Death would never settle, for one petal at a time

He would pluck the fucker!

Lo, this malleus eve, is heaving to the pulse of souls

She was the game, sublime
A Knight takes Queen in ruby, Indisputable
Then her eyes, they paralyzed me for a second time
A glimpse so achingly beautiful

Drinking in her flora this Aurora to the storm
I was burning in the furnace of a love that went to war
With ravenous desire, fires lit the heavens for
Caressing in the rainfall, a less painful metaphor
For this hunger

On marbled tomb
Breathless, cocooned
A long red dress shrouds, like Ophelia, this Goddess
Mourning then crawls
Black velvet palled
To pass fervent lips, betwixt her deliciousness

Miserere Mei Diva
Forgive me forever my bride
But a gift was delivered, however perverse
On that night you exquisitely died

(Seraphina rise)
Arcane perfection, her legend was etched
(To queen demon revised)
A fell resurrection, unparalleled in this world or next

Awaken, forsaken, by others so taken as prey
Now you shall stand in the grandeur of love
A wonderland in which to play

The beast in the clouds spat back the moon
And arrayed in a crown of glittering cobwebs
She slid to her feet like a prophet of doom
Born to immortal darkness as mortality slipped away

She was a flame, divine
My gnathic call of duty, irrefutable
Her eyes imparadised me with their wicked shine
A glimpse so achingly beautiful

Now she stirs the night just like the perfect Lorelei
As she spurs the dark horse foaming in my soul

Death is fleet, sweet, oft discreet, the beast in beauty's mask
Her skies, bediademed, complete, now freed of days grown overcast
