It's not for glory nor for riches
Nor the honors that I sing
But to sing a song of freedom
All the joy I long to bring

Not for riches nor the glory
Nor the honors that I sing
But to sing a song of freedom
Sing a song we all can sing

Okay, right
See it in their eyes
Earth's the rock
That floats in open space
Truth or lies
See it in their eyes
Earth's a rock
That floats in open space

Be it blue or white
See it in their eyes
Earth's the rock
That floats in open space
Hope they rise
As the stars align
Earth the rock
That floats in open space

It's not for glory nor for riches
Nor the honors that I sing
But to sing a song of freedom
Sing a song we all can sing

(It's not for riches nor the glory)
