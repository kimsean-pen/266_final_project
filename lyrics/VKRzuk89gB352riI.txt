Electrocution
I will intensify
Voltage division
Your power I defy

Disconnecting all mankind
Endless conflict
To the end of time
To the end of time

Pulse modulation

Disrupting energy
Harmonic vision
Throughout eternity
My dissonance empowers you

Mind distortion always cutting through
I will never break
Or suffer your hate
Flowing through my veins

Dielectric strength
Dielectric strength
Insulated to resist
My free will must exist

I will be the avalanche

Bringing your world to collapse
I will be the avalanche

Bringing your world to collapse
My dissonance empowers you

Mind always cutting through
I will never break

Or suffer your hate
Flowing through my veins
Dielectric strength
I will never fade
Will never fade
I resist the pain
I resist the pain
Burning through my veins
Through my veins
Dielectric strength
Dielectric strength
