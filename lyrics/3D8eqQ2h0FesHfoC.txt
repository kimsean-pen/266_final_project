ft. Nai Palm
There's still the dust that gently bows
From the beat of a hunger that can't be drowned
I could breathe this bliss on the way and it must be the sound
Velvet the hue, our tissue
Our contest that some men seek surrender deep in my chest
That's the antidote
A habit of occurrence that makes in time my clarity
The length of each stripe boundless in rich and density
Factually there's no way for gravity
Mercy for my rental and honking on my diary, it's not the time
I awoke to the sound of Ali
Smoke from the blood, it might seem that I make behind me
You badgering me, testing me, no leaf unfolded
