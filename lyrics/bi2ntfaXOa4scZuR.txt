I would have given you all of my heart
But theres someone whos torn it apart
And shes taken just all that I had
But if you want Ill try to love again
Baby Ill try to love again but I know

The first cut is the deepest
Baby I know the first cut is the deepest
But when it come to being lucky she's cursed
When it come to loving me she's worse

I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that Ive cried
And I'm sure going to give you a try
And if you want I'll try to love again
Baby Ill try to love again but I know

The first cut is the deepest
Baby I know the first cut is the deepest
But when it come to being lucky she's cursed
When it come to loving me she's worse

I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that Ive cried
But Im sure gonna give you a try
cause if you want I'll try to love again
Baby Ill try to love again but I know
The first cut is the deepest
Baby I know the first cut is the deepest
When it come to being lucky she's cursed
When it come to loving me she's worse
