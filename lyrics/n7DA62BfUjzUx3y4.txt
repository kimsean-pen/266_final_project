Time
It's never worth my time
Blue shine
Bleeds into my eyes

I still
Sleep on the right side

Of the white noise
Can't leave the scene behind
Could I be anything you want me to be
It's always meant to be seen

When you see yourself in a crowded room
Do your fingers itch, are you pistol-whipped
Will you step in line or release the glitch
Can you fall asleep with a panic switch

And when you see yourself in a crowded room
Do your fingers itch, are you pistol-whipped
Will you step in line or release the glitch
Do you think she'll sleep with the panic...

...
Mm, I'll try

To hold on tight tonight
Pink slip
Inviting me inside
Wanna burn skin

And brand what once was mine
But the red views
Keep ripping the divide
If I go everywhere you want me to go

How will I know you'll still follow
When you see yourself in a crowded room
Do your fingers itch, are you pistol-whipped
Will you step in line or release the glitch

Can you fall asleep with a panic switch
And when you see yourself in a crowded room
Do your fingers itch, are you pistol-whipped
Will you step in line or release the glitch

Do you think she'll sleep with the panic...
...
I'm waiting and fading and floating away
I'm waiting and fading and floating away

I'm waiting and fading and floating away
Waiting and fading and floating
I'm waiting and fading and floating away
Waiting and fading and floating away
Waiting and fading and floating away
Waiting and fading, waiting and fading
When you see yourself in a crowded room
Do your fingers itch, are you pistol-whipped
Will you step in line or release the glitch
Can you fall asleep with a panic switch
And when you see yourself in a crowded room
Do your fingers itch, are you pistol-whipped
Will you step in line or release the glitch
Do you think she'll sleep with the panic...
