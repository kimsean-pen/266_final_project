what were you thinking last night all night
you were in and still like outside
you were once in pageants, i know
you were in the club lights i know
you were in the past tense so slowed
i was right there with you though
feelings came like heavy then
i want tongue and nothing else...
i want you like bad
come to me in violent ways and can't even react
acting selfish in the back
taking selfies in all black
so you were under club lights so cool
i was right there with you too...

i saw you without pretense years ago
you were in the club like so cold...

with yr legs on my hands
it's cool i'm a fan
i thought about loving once and never again
i thought i was passionate, like i'm passionate man
in shadows i stand
in shadows i'm next to you
what's yr number and plans
in visions i come to you when yr out with yr friends
or out without friends...
and i call but the cell is off and i miss you again
i'm tied to yr hands
i'm tethered to everything...

what were you thinking last night all night...
you were in and still like outside
you were once in pageants, i know
you were in the club lights i know
