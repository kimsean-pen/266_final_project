Wait for me, you said
Waiting was all I did
I went away wishing I'd stayed
You used the time to trade my name

Naked as I could be
You made the most of what I threw
Flexin' the truth more than I knew
I turn myself to someone new

I'm not a saint, I became everything I hate
I still paint you red, just to forget your name
And piece myself together with a stale glue
Found out you're full of shit, why don't you swallow it?

Caught up in the very best of you
Tunnel vision and a point to prove
Persistent for an oh so daisy blue
With nothing but a selfish point of view
So take your crooked friends
Wipe off your silent grin
'Cause when you held my hand, should've dug my nails in
Tell me how the absence of me made you sore
Your words are full of shit, I'll make you swallow it

Not a saint, I became everything I hate
I still paint you red, just to forget your name
And piece myself together with a stale glue
Found out you're full of shit, why don't you swallow it?

Wait for me, you said
Waiting was all I did
I went away, wishing I'd stayed
You used the time to trade my name

Not a saint, I became everything I hate
I still paint you red, just to forget your name
And piece myself together with a stale glue
Found out you're full of shit, why don't you swallow it?
Why don't you swallow it?
