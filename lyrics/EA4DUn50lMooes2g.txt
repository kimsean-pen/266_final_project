I'm in the sky when I'm on my floor
The world's a mess and you're my only cure
There's no time for me to act mature
The only words I know are more, more and more

No one to criticize me then
No one to criticize
No one to criticize me then
No one to criticize

There's no fear when I'm in my room
It's so clear and I know just what I want to do
Eau d'bedroom dancing
To you I wanna say, you're my thing

You teach me, you teach me, you teach me, you teach me
You only teach me wisely, only show me why
I remember, I remember everything
I don't wanna stop, I remember everything
