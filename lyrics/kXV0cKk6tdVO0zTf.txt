I am a steady rollin' man and I roll both night and day
I am a steady rollin' man and I roll both night and day
But I ain't got no sweet woman
Woo hoo Lord, to be rollin' this way

I am the man that rolls when icicles are hangin' on the tree
I am the man that rolls when icicles are hangin' on the trees
Why can't you hear me beggin' Mama?
Woo hoo Lord, down on my bended knee

I am a steady rollin' man and I roll both night and day
Steady rollin' man and I roll both night and day
But I ain't got no sweet woman
Woo hoo Lord, to be rollin' this way
