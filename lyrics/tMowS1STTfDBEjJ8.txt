I can feel it in a moment
Just let the words trickle out
Force my head into the morning
I don't know what I have but doubt
Seems to find its way
Force my eyes into the pictures
Lets go out and find a way to live
I can see our youth depicted
On the screens of the innocent
And I know
where you go
Its just harder to rely
I found it out, its over

Lets go and drive
Pick up and drive

I can feel it in a second
Just let the words trickle down
What i had was nothing less than
I don't know why I feel so down
And I know, its hard
What's all this falling out

Let's go and drive
Work this all out
Feel it this time
See what its all about
Let's go outside
Work this all out
See what we find
See what this life's about

I wont forget about it
Words you never say
I wont forget about it
Words you never say
Oh you try to take the best from this
Your bones begin to shake and miss
At the sight of something natural
By your window side
With a garden full of your favourite lights
It seems so tough not knowing
Where you're going but she know
The words she always spoke

Let's go and drive
Work this all out
Feel it this time
See what its all about
Let's go outside
Work this all out
See what we find
See what this life's about

Let's go and drive
Work this all out
Feel it this time
See what its all about
Let's go outside
Work this all out
See what we find
See what this life's about
See what this life's about
See what this life's about
