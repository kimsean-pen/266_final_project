He said don't sugar coat things
My brain's made of poison
And I've been on my own for
All my years, I️'m losing touch of love
You were the one, I swore, but now I know
It's done forever more
I've been here darling, please just go

You weren't the one for me, I swear
That even though you didn't care
You said you did each time I asked

I fell in love with a death wish
I fell in love with a death wish
I ask me why must I do this
I fell in love with a death wish

He said I love you solely
But I can taste the honey
Honey in his words
That drip with half truths and half lies
I should have known
It's no surprise the way he looked me in my eyes
And said I love you but his was half true

You weren't the one for me, I swear
That even though you didn't care
You said you did each time I asked

I fell in love with a death wish
I fell in love with a death wish
I ask me why must I do this
I fell in love with a death wish
And there's no escape

I always fell in love with all the ways you lied
But I don't really know how I survived
Through the games, but I choke
The moon can only promise so much to the sun
But I know, I know
You weren't the one for me, I swear
That even though you didn't care
You said you did each time I asked
Those were the lies we're in the past
Tell all your friends I️'m coming back
And tell your sins I do not lack
Keep my name out of your mouth
Or think about me until you drown
