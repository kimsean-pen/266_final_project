Endless war, endless screams in the boundaries of Hell we live
Total death, total hate, on the devastated plains we fight
Evil minds, insane minds, mutilated corpses over the ground
Soldiers of Hell, soldiers of death, seeking victims to exterminate

Black death, black night, where the spirits leave their crypts
Tortured souls, drifting souls by the world of hate
Multi-radiation, multi-death, destroys and kills even in the deep of Hell
Fallen corpse, fallen angel, total injury is the only rule

Mayhem

Death slaughter, death rules, under the sign of fear we live
Bestial lust, bestial rites, darkness send it's bestial warriors
Shrill cries, tormenting cries break the silence of the dark night
Living with hate, living with death, giving the world total destruction

Blood world, rotting world, corrosion of insane human mind
Black pest, devastating pest
Under the evoking circle we pray, baptized skulls, evil skulls
People screaming chained underground

Mayhem
