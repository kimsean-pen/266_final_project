If I could face them
If I could make amends
with all my shadows
I'd bow my head and welcome them

But I feel it burning
Like when the winter wind
Stops my breathing
Are you really gonna love me when I'm gone?
I fear you won't
I fear you don't

And it echoes when I breathe
Until all you'll see is my ghost
Empty vessel, crooked teeth
Wish you could see
And they call me under

And I'm shaking like a leaf
And they call me under
And I wither underneath
In the storm

I am a stranger
I am an alien
inside a structure
Are you really gonna love me when I'm gone?
With all my thoughts
And all my faults

I feel it biting
I feel it break my skin
so uninvited
Are you really gonna need me when I'm gone?
I fear you won't
I feel you don't

And it echoes when I breathe
Until all you'll see is my ghost
Empty vessel, crooked teeth
Wish you could see
And they call me under

And I'm shaking like a leaf
And they call me under
And I wither underneath
In this storm
I feel it

And they call me under
And I'm shaking like a leaf
And they call me underneath
To the storm
