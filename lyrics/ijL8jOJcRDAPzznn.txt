Fell asleep, I fell asleep, I fell asleep
And nothing had changed
I thought I saw
(Fell asleep, I fell asleep)
Birds falling from the sky
(I fell asleep and nothing had changed)

The filigree of you and I
And you will always be
Young and alive
Oh my God, it's been so long
More than I can stand
Fell asleep dreaming
And nothing had changed
But I was still a man and things were just the same

Fell asleep, I fell asleep, I fell asleep
And nothing had changed
I thought I saw
(Fell asleep, I fell asleep)
Birds falling from the sky
(I fell asleep and nothing had changed)
