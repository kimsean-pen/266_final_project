Don't tell your mama
She doesn't know
Your dress looks better
When on the floor

Don't tell your father
Cause he'll go mad
He doesn't like me
Like me in your bed

Oh if they only knew
All the dirty things you can do
You didn't learn that in Sunday school
Oh no oh no

We're drunk and irresponsible
We gonna act like animals
And get a little sexual
But no one has to know oh, oh
No one has to know, oh, oh, oh

Don't tell your brother
What we gon' do
Don't tell your sister
She want' me to

We're young and reckless
Let's not pretend
You like it better
When i'm in your bed

Oh if they only knew
All the dirty things you can do
You didn't learn that in Sunday school
Oh no oh no

We're drunk and irresponsible
We gonna act like animals
And get a little sexual
But no one has to know oh, oh
No one has to know, oh, oh, oh

We're drunk and irresponsible
We gonna act like animals
And get a little sexual
But no one has to know oh, oh
No one has to know, oh, oh, oh

Just pour that drink and let it go
Let's keep it irresponsible
Just get that body on the floor
You know we like it, we like it when

We're drunk and irresponsible
We gonna act like animals
And get a little sexual
But no one has to know oh, oh
No one has to know, oh, oh, oh

We're drunk and irresponsible
We gonna act like animals
And get a little sexual
But no one has to know oh, oh
No one has to know, oh, oh, oh

We're drunk and irresponsible
(Oh if they only knew)
We gonna act like animals
And get a little sexual
But no one has to know oh, oh
No one has to know, oh, oh, oh
