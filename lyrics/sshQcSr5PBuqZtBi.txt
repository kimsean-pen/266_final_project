Are we gonna work out?
Are we gonna make it alright?
Are we gonna wake up?
Are we just wasting our time?
Try to run away,
Stall another day,
Time is never right,
You shouldn't be here.
If you wanna go,
Then baby please know.
I'll be alright,
Right in my time,
You won't have to lie,
We just need to say goodbye,
It's about time,
The truth comes out, truth comes out...
Are we gonna make up?
Are you gonna act like we're fine?
(Are you gonna act like we're fine?)
Think it's time to face up,
Can't just keep ignoring the signs...
I'll be alright,
Right in my time,
You don't have to lie,
We just need to say goodbye,
It's about time,
The truth comes out, the truth comes out...
All in All
When all is lost,
What we need,
Is to break it off...
With all our faults,
I wanna fly,
Don't wanna leave,
But I think it's time...
All in All
When all is lost,
What we need,
Is to break it off,
With all our faults
Don't wanna fall
Don't wanna leave,
But I think it's time...
