recap in taxi
no clothes no food
take care of the children
we'll send for you soon

alien
you find you feel at home
everywhere
you'll get by
with so much less than anyone

decieved
entrapment through belief
disclosure would decree
accusations would be shed
instead
we stand over the dead
the cultures all well fed
killer running free

outside the window
the passing night sky
fills with people i know
taking me
home
