Storming forth with dreadful guns
To obliterate the chosen ones
Lucifer legions under the banner of the horns
Slaying and crushing as the infidel mourns
Crushing with metallic
Behold us with fright as we storm through the night

Blooddawn

Storming forth with dreadful guns
To obliterate the chosen once
Hear our warcry as we reign the battlefield
Now you can't hide behind no shelter nor shield
The heavens will bleed when the angels fall
Gunned down by the soldiers who have heard our call

Blooddawn

Storming forth with dreadful guns
To obliterate the chosen ones
Our killing spree is thrilling me
And by our guns you'll blasted be
Lost are those who worshipped the liar
Panzer division Marduk engulfs you in fire

Blooddawn
