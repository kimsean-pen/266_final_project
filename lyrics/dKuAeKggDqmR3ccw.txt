I want some, some energy
The ultimate discovery
Electric blue for me
Never more to be free

Electricity
Nuclear and H E B
Come fuels from the sea
Wasted electricity

I want some, some energy
Electricity
All we need is to learn to save
And if a man would throw away

It doesn't change the city cost
The alternative is only one
The final source of energy
Solar electricity

Electricity, electricity
Electricity, electricity
Electricity
