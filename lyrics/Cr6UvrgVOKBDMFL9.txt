The how I cant recall
But im staring at
What once was the wall
Separating east and west

Now they meet admidst
The broad daylight

So this is where you are
And this is where I am
Somewhere between
Unsure and a hundred

Its hard I must confess
But I'm banking on the rest to clear away
Cause we have spoken everything

Everything short of I love you
You right where you are
From right where I am

Somewhere between
Unsure and a hundred
Somewhere between
Unsure and a hundred
And who's to say its wrong
And who's to say that its not right
Where we should be for now

So this is where you are
And this is where I am
So this is where you are
And this is where ive been
And this is where I've been
Somewhere between
Unsure and a hundred
