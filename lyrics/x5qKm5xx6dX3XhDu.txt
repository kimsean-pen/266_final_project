Old friend of mine we will never lose the time
That we've shared all these years, these years

Old friend of mine we will never lose the time
That we've shared all these years, these years

Will - you?
Will - you?

Will you make it in the end
Through all the twists and bends?
Will you fulfil your dreams?
Not as easy as it seems

Lover, friend of mine
We will never lose the time
That we've covered in our tears
In our tears

Lover, friend of mine we will never lose the time
That we've covered in our tears, in our tears

Will - you?

Will you make it in the end
Through all the twists and bends?
Will you fulfil your dreams?
Not as easy as it seems

Eeahhi eeahi eah eah eeahhi eeahhi
Eeahhi eeahi eah eah eeahhi eeahhi
Eeahhi eeahi eah eah eeahhi eeahhi

Floating in the weir and you think you'll never sink
So you forget all your fears your fears
Floating in the weir and you think you'll never sink
So you forget all your fears your fears

Will - you?
Will - you?

Will you make it in the end
Through all the twists and bends?
Will you fulfil your dreams?
Not as easy as it seems
