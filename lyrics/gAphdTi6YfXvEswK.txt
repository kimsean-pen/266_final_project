(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
I don't need to feel like I can't do this all on my own
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh)
Welcome to the guilty party

This'll be the last time that you see us playing dead (Yeah)
We're all so malignant, bitter and twisted
It's just another blame game while you cry for help (Yeah)
Good grief, let go

Defeatist, you let your demons hold you
Unforsaken, like getting blood from a stone
You try to shake them but they won't let you go
And we don't have to the time to stop and look at all we destroyed

With an idle mind in a real life
It's every man for himself if we're gonna survive
And when the lights go out this time
This time there's gonna be a riot
(Woah)

One nail, outs the other
One nail, outs the other
One nail, outs the other
We shed our skin as we try to recover

Your eyes shine the sun
Your skin blows the wind
Your eyes shine the sun
And your skin blows the wind
And your eyes
I don't need to feel like I can't do this all on my own
(Eyes)
I don't need to feel like I can't do this all on my own

With an idle mind in a real life
It's every man for himself if we're gonna survive
And when the lights go out this time
This time there's gonna be a riot
(Woah)

No heroine, no redeemer
Life's anaesthetic is sleep

Welcome to the guilty party
(Oh, oh)
Everything you've done
Everything you've done
You've undone with this
(Oh, oh)
(Oh)
Shut up

Your eyes shine the sun
Your skin blows the wind
Your eyes shine the sun
And your skin blows the wind
And your eyes
I don't need to feel like I can't do this all on my own
(Eyes)
I don't need to feel like I can't do this all on my own
I don't need to feel like I can't do this all on my own

(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
