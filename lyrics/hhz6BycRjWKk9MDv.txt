Meet your maker
Rising from the ashes
Like a phoenix to the sky
So intense, so glorious...

Uncontrollable desire
For our souls
The great lawgiver
So high and mighty

The immaculate deception
A taker of life
With unbridled aggression
Striking down on the disbelievers

Savage - Messiah
Take us higher
Savage - Messiah
Take us now!

Blessed in blood
We are reborn in hate
Thousands of spirits cry
So intense, so glorious...

Uncontrollable desire
For our souls
The great Messiah
So high and mighty
