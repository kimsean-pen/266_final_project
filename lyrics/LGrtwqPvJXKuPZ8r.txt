And if it's bad
don't let it get you down
you can take it.
And if it hurts
don't let them see you cry
you can make it.

Hold your head up, woman
hold your head up, woman
hold your head up, woman
hold your head high.
hHold your head up, woman
hold your head up, woman
hold your head up, woman
hold your head high.

And if they stare
just let them burn their eyes
on you moving.
And if they shout
don't let it change a thing
that you're doing.

Hold your head up, woman
hold your head up, woman
hold your head up, woman
hold your head high.
Hold your head up, woman
hold your head up, woman
hold your head up, woman
hold your head high.

Hold your head up, woman

hold your head high.

And if they stare
just let them burn their eyes
on you moving.
And if they shout
don't let it change a thing
that you're doing.
