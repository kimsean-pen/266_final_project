Yeah
Feel like falling in love tonight

All the stars are lighting, it feels perfect
Melodies and verses flowing through my mind
I wanna lean in forward, kiss, I know it's worth it
I barely know you, baby, but I know it's time

You see the way the strobe lights are dancing
I look in your eyes and I
(Feel like falling in love tonight)
Tonight
(Falling in love tonight)

And baby, I'm all for taking chances
(Romance is in the air)
Feel like falling in love tonight
Falling in love tonight
(I hope you're ready, baby)

And when the moon gets high let's start with some kisses
(Falling in love tonight)
I hear the wind whisper your name in the air
(Falling in love tonight)

Last night you were the one I was missin'
(Falling in love tonight)
But tonight you're standing right there
(Falling in love tonight)

Feel like a movie, the DJ plays the soundtrack
And I feel like I found that man who wants my heart
I should've knew it, the moment that you blew it
You know what you're doin', the best part's bout to start, baby

You see the way the strobe lights are dancing
I look in your eyes and I
(Feel like falling in love tonight)
Tonight
(Falling in love tonight)

And baby, I'm all for taking chances
(Romance is in the air)
And I feel like falling in love tonight
Falling in love tonight
(I hope you're ready, baby)

And when the moon gets high let's start with some kisses
(Falling in love tonight)
I hear the wind whisper your name in the air, baby
(Falling in love tonight)

Last night you were the one I was missin'
(Falling in love tonight)
But tonight you're standing right there
(Falling in love tonight)

And it's like I'm up on cloud 9 'cause I know I found my
(I really think I found my future in this club)
Caught up in the trends here
When I saw you stand there
I think I'm ready, baby

You see the way the strobe lights are dancing
