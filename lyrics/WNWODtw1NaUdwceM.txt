If Heaven is a place where the angels go
Well then, I got a story to tell
If Heaven is a place where the angels go
Then I guess you're going straight to Hell

Don't wanna leave you now or never
'Cause we're perfect together and never wanna be apart
Dare to take on the simple life
There was trouble for us when I came home early
Never would expect to see this
It's fair to say, could not believe my eyes
You cracked a smile but had nothing to say
So I made a list of how you're gonna pay

I locked you out, left you naked in the front yard
Burned all of your clothes
Having nothing can be really hard
Now I'm on the run, I'd do it all again
So catch me if you can, 'cause
I took your car with your baby in the backseat
Wrecked your credit card, you're in debt to a deadbeat
Maybe now you know how much it hurt
When I caught you in the act wearing nothing but a little smirk

Now I feel better but it's hard to forget
I never think of looking back
'Cause time has no meaning when you're free
Oh, this is what you get, karma bitch
Now I see who you really are
'Cause happiness is the best revenge

Caught red-handed with a grin on your face
Didn't think you'd be so easy to replace

I locked you out, left you naked in the front yard
Burned all of your clothes
Having nothing can be really hard
Now I'm on the run, I'd do it all again
So catch me if you can, 'cause
I took your car with your baby in the backseat
Wrecked your credit card, you're in debt to a deadbeat
Baby now you know how much it hurt
When I caught you in the act wearing nothing but a little smirk

Again and again and again and again

If Heaven is a place where the angels go
Well then, I got a story to tell
If Heaven is a place where the angels go
Then I know I'm going straight to Hell

I locked you out, left you naked in the front yard
Burned all of your clothes
Having nothing can be really hard
Now I'm on the run, I'd do it all again
So catch me if you can, 'cause
I took your car with your baby in the backseat
Wrecked your credit card, you're in debt to a deadbeat
Maybe now you know how much it hurt
When I caught you in the act wearing nothing but a little smirk
Wearing nothing but a little smirk
