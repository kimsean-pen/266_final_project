Somebody's screaming out
Somebody's knocking out
Somebody's calling out
Come, hear it again

Street bells are ringing out
Young girls are singing out
Boys are building up big to be men

You've got the love then here comes the blood last
The father, the mother, the sister, the chain
Sweet inspirations or a cold hearted nations, baby
The young man, the brothers, the killers explain

Oh jungleland, they call you home sweet home
You make me feel so sad, to leave here all alone
But there is a kid called Hope and he's holding out his hand
He sees the northern lights above this high rise land
Oh jungleland, oh jungleland, oh jungleland

In the city, get out the city pretty quick
I've got a prayer, I'm gonna sing it to you
Can little children forget the wild things?
But no one listens cause nobody cares

You've got the love drugs, you've got the long nights
You got the heartbeat that spirals to heaven
Here comes summer, here comes violence
Over your shoulder the soul boy explains

Oh jungleland, they call you home sweet home
You make me feel so sad, to leave here all alone
But there is a kid called Hope and he's holding out his hand
He sees the northern lights above this high rise land

But blood is thicker than water
But blood is sweeter than Holy Lands
Unto the Devil, a daughter
When my love sings it's an angel song she sings it

Don't look back, never look back
Don't look back, never look back
Don't look back, never look back
Don't look back, never look back

Don't look back, never look back
Don't look back, never look back
Don't look back

Oh jungleland, you make me feel so sad
To leave here all alone, oh jungleland
You make me feel so sad

You've got the love drugs, you've got the long nights
You got the heartbeat that spirals to heaven
You've got the love drugs, you've got the long nights
You got the heartbeat that spirals to heaven

You've got the love drugs, you've got the long nights
You got the heartbeat that spirals to heaven
You've got the love drugs, you've got the long nights
You got the heart that, come on, take me away
Take me, take me away
