He used to be a singer in a rock and roll band
He would write the songs and I'd tremble at his hand
But oh, la, la, he lost poetic ethic
And his songs were pathetic, he's a failure now

And he used to be the life and soul of everyone around
You'd never catch him looking up and never see him down
But oh, la la, he couldn't raise a smile
No, not for a while and he's a failure now

Don't cry, child, you've got so much more to live for
Don't cry, child, you've got something I would die for
And if it comes to the rain, just be glad you'll smile again
'Cause so many don't and so many go unnamed

People push right past me shouting their exclaims
A preacher pushes me aside and asked to wash my sins
I said no, la, la, if he made me in his image
Then he's a failure too

And I used to need a couple o' people keep my head down
Now I need a whole lot more to keep me on the ground
But oh, la, la, I gave up something and I gave it up for nothing
And I am a failure now
Don't cry, child, you've got so much more to live for
Don't cry, child, you've got something I would die for
And if it comes to the rain, just be glad you'll smile again
'Cause so many don't and so many go unnamed
