Living free
You don't always see
The beauty that he can bring
When you're a million miles away from home
He said
He loves you and he's done with me
So embrace him in
Embrace him in
While you can

This ain't just a heartbreak
This ain't just a heartache
I'm happy for you two
Even though he's loving you
This ain't just a heartbreak
This ain't just a heartache
I'm happy for you two
Even though he's loving you

Guess I have to murder you 2
What?
She was smilin
When she saw us in the backseat
I knew she wanted you
From your head down to your feet
Knew she wanted head down
I knew she wanted you
From your head down to your feet
Tell me baby tell me baby
Tell me

She was smilin
When she saw us in the backseat
I knew she wanted you
From your head down to your feet
Knew she wanted head down
I knew she wanted you
From your head down to your feet

Can't make you love me
But I can make you plead
When I fuck with your beauty
I will, nah
Poor girl
She didn't know what was coming for her

This ain't just a heartbreak
This ain't just a heartache
I'm happy for you two
Even though he's loving you

Guess I have to murder you 2
What?
She was smilin
When she saw us in the backseat
I knew she wanted you
From your head down to your feet
Knew she wanted head down
I knew she wanted you
From your head down to your feet
Tell me baby tell me baby
Tell me

She was smilin
When she saw us in the backseat
I knew she wanted you
From your head down to your feet
Knew she wanted head down
I knew she wanted you
From your head down to your feet

She never looked at you in the same way
I did, I did
You were never meant to be
Anyway, anyway

Guess I have to murder you 2
