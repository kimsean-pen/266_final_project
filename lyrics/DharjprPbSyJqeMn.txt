We were wildfires
Lighting the sky 'til the flickers are just blinding
If only I could just remember the feeling
I just wanna go back that way, can we go back that way?
They bittersweet feelings, the feelings sohappy

You're bringing me up, down down down
Spinning my head 'round 'round 'round
Bringing me up, breaking me down
Spinning my head 'round 'round 'round
Bringing me up, down down down
Spinning my head baby, 'round 'round 'round
Your love, oh oh
Oh oh oh oh...

I can't help it
Why does it hurt this bad to feel so good?
It's what I keep asking myself over and again
Everytime you get me high, i make mistake, yeah

You're bringing me up, down down down
Spinning my head 'round 'round 'round
Bringing me up, breaking me down
Spinning my head 'round 'round 'round
Bringing me up, down down down
Spinning my head baby, 'round 'round 'round
Your love, oh oh
Oh oh oh oh...

I push you, you pull me
We back in
We go through the same thing
I push you, you pull me
We back in
We go through the same thing
Oh oh oh...
