Told me there was no rules
When you came out of the blue
Guarded myself from mornings
Crushes don't come with warning
Never have you looked so cute
As when suggesting me
To start something new
Labelled in your head
As a simple flame
But simple makes you melt
Every time you hear me sing
Your favourite star...
And now I'm your favourite star
You made me your favourite star
(If you got to know me)
(If you took the time)
(I wouldn't have to tie you in)
You got to know me
And you took the time
(But you keep on chasing)
(What you never find)
(Cos I'm still on your mind)
Cos I'm still on your mind
So you decide it's fool [?]
Never gave any clue
We will part and never speak
But my voice is in your ever-dream
If it was up to you
I'll be feinting as a deja vu [?]
A shame you couldn't keep up
To your place
Now I have to leave
Memories in your head
Your favourite star...
And now I'm your favourite star
You made me your favourite star
(If you got to know me)
(If you took the time)
(I wouldn't have to tie you in)
You got to know me
And you took the time
(But you keep on chasing)
(What you never find)
(Cos I'm still on your mind)
Cos I'm still on your mind
And maybe if
If you got to know me
Would you change your mind
Maybe if you got to know me
If you took the time
Just maybe if you took the time
