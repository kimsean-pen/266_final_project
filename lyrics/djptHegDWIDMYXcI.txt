Brand new kid in a brand new town
Heart's be in dirt as he spirals down
Feel so close so we can't quit now
Brand new kid in a brand new town

And then i heard those words
And i feel them burn
But they made me so much stronger
To the summer rain i'll begin the game
As it starts to clear

Maybe i got this wrong
Maybe i'll lose it all
But i feel, feel
Like i found my home
Maybe it's just a phase
Maybe my world will change
But i feel, feel
Like i found my home

Brand new man with a brand new view
City lights never looked so good
Still got time to unfold my truth ohh
I'm a brand new man with a brand new view

I still hear those words
I still feel them burn
They will always make me stronger
Now to the summer rain i'll begin the game
As it starts to clear

Maybe i got this wrong
Maybe i'll lose it all
But i feel, feel
Like i found my home
Maybe it's just a phase
Maybe my world will change
But i feel, feel
Like i found my home

I feel
Like i found my
Like i found my
Like i found my
I feel
Like i found my
Like i found my home tonight

Maybe i got this wrong
Maybe i'll lose it all
But i feel, feel
Like i found my home
Maybe it's just a phase
Maybe my world will change
But i feel, feel
Like i found my home

I feel
Like i found my
Like i found my
Like i found my
I feel
Like i found my
Like i found my home

I feel
Like i found my
Like i found my
Like i found my
I feel
Like i found my
Like i found my home
