You've been looking for more
I've been holding my head
You've been filling on spaces I'm working too much
It's the life we're living now
And it's beautiful somehow
I've been waiting for the sun to rise

Where you are
So I can tell you you're a superstar
I've been waiting for our worlds to be in line
So I can let you know that baby you're the rest of my life

You have love, you have cared
You've been so good to me
I can try, hard enough just to make you believe
We've been holding on so rise
Cause we need it way too much
I've been waiting for the sun to rise

Where you are
So I can tell you you're a superstar
I've been waiting for our worlds to be in line
So I can let you know that baby you're the rest of my life

I've been dreaming of a future
That looks like our past
And they'll admire that we made it last
So I've been waiting for the sun to rise where you are

So I can tell you you're a superstar
You know I think about it all the time
You will runaway with me
And we'll go looking for a place to hide
And you will be at home with me
You will be at home with me

We will be at home
I've been waiting for the sun to rise
Where you are
So I can tell you you're a superstar

I've been waiting for our worlds to be in line
So I can let you know that baby you're the rest of my life
I've been dreaming of a future
That looks like our past
And they'll admire that we made it last
so I've been waiting for the sun to rise
Where you are
So I can tell you you're a superstar
It's the life we're living now
