Don't take her for granted
She had hard time
Don't misunderstand her
Or play with her mind
Treat her so gently
It will pay you in time
You've got to know
She's a sensitive kind

Tell her you love her
Each and every night
You will discover
She will treat you right
If you believe
I know you will find
There ain't nothing like
The sensitive kind

She is so lonely
Waiting for you
You are the only
Thing that help her through
Don't take her for granted
she had a hard time
You've got to know
She's a sensitive kind
