A long way to get here
The chaosmöngers scream
No more, control,
Leave minds, alone
We'll turn it upside down
Been waiting oh so long
This is it, it's finished
This is it, we get it!
The big liar on his side
Hiding, hearing inside:
No more, control,
Leave minds, alone.
We'll show them what we got
Forever they'll be locked
This is what, you look for
This is more, this is war!
It's gonna be, hostility
Hypothetic is liberty
Anti-being society
As directed reality
My point of view that's for sure
Is lucid but insecure
Revolution is evident
Chaosmöngers are resistant
You better shake up your mind
Coz if you're just staying blind
Integrity you won't find
The discord is real now
Echo is very loud!
No more control,
Leave minds alone
Soon the system will die
It's another rough time
Don't back off, and stand up
Go for it, we need it!
My point of view that's for sure
Is septic and insecure
Evolution isn't a shame
Each member stays in the game
You better shake up your mind
Coz if you're just staying blind
Integrity you won't find
Maybe we'll win, maybe we'll loose
Confrontation, both side they use
Macrosolutions to megaproblems (4)
It hasn't changed
It's all the same
You'll check the box
You'll put that cross
The vote is done, another one
My point of view that's for sure
Is worry and insecure
But I won't forget this gang
The chaosmöngers who still stand
You better shake up your mind
Coz if you're just staying blind
Integrity you won't find
