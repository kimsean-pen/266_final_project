I was cool already
Way before you met me
In my Tims and my Happy socks
And I know how to get 'em off
See my skies all sunny
Got a pocket full of money
And maybe there's not a lot
But damn, I'm in a good spot

Got nothing to hide
You're not playing this right
You want some advice?

Boy, don't be killing my
Boy, don't be killing my vibe
My vibe, oh my vibe
Boy, don't be killing my
Boy, don't be killing my vibe
My vibe, my vibe
Boy, don't be killing my
You just be killing me

Rock your body, rock steady
Love me, baby, I'm so ready
Wanna get lucky tonight
Boy, don't be killing my
Boy, don't be killing my vibe

Pla-player, I'm a real soothsayer
There's a future in you and me
Upstairs in my balcony
Yeah, got a good buzz going
And it feels good knowing
Got my girls here who got my back
And the guys got to deal with that

Got nothing to hide
You're not playing this right
You want some advice?

Boy, don't be killing my
Boy, don't be killing my vibe
My vibe, oh my vibe
Boy, don't be killing my
Boy, don't be killing my vibe
My vibe, my vibe
Boy, don't be killing my
You just be killing me

Rock your body, rock steady
Love me, baby, I'm so ready
Wanna get lucky tonight
Boy, don't be killing my
Boy, don't be killing my vibe

I think I wanna what you got
You're the one who's got the shot
And now you don't go blowing it talking about your heart
Don't be so serious
Boy, don't be killing my
Boy, don't be killing my vibe

Rock your body, rock steady
Love me, baby, I'm so ready
Wanna get lucky tonight
Boy, don't be killing my
Boy, don't be killing my vibe
Boy, don't be killing my
You just be killing me

Rock your body, rock steady
Love me, baby, I'm so ready
Wanna get lucky tonight
Boy, don't be killing my
You just be killing me
Rock your body, rock steady
Love me, baby, I'm so ready
Wanna get lucky tonight
Boy, don't be killing my
Boy, don't be killing my vibe
