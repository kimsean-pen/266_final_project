You go down the riverside when you're down
Your sending the shivers down my spine
You get stuck in the moment, you get high on air
And your wild heart is broken but it won't stop there

'Cause you will crash and burn
'Cause in the night I'm losing, you will crash and burn
You crash and never learn

You crash and never learn
You crash and burn

'Cause you crash and burn crash

You think that your way of life is justified
You break every rule and law for love and life
You get stuck in the moment, you get high on air
And your wild heart is broken but it won't stop there

'Cause you will crash and burn
'Cause in the night I'm losing, you will crash and burn
You crash and never learn
You crash and never learn
You crash and burn

Cause you crash and burn

Don't break down, don't break it down, don't break down
Don't break down, don't you break it down, don't break down
Don't break down, don't break it down, don't break down
Don't break down, don't you break it down, don't break down

You crash and, you crash and, you crash and

'Cause you will crash and burn
(You crash and, you crash and)
You will crash and burn

Crash and burn
Crash and burn
