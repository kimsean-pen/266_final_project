I wrote the words to this song on the back of a photograph
Behind your back, it goes
A little something like this
It's way to big to miss

I got a letter in the mail
The sender failed to let me know where it came from
Opened it up and sure enough
There we were arm in arm again

I know it's small but my last call's been called a half an hour ago
I know it's late, but do you think you could at least fix it for me?
Then I'll go, I'll go alone, I swear I won't tell a soul
I'll drink this beer and write in fear of a song everybody hates

Armageddon, let the light in
Before we say goodbye give us something to believe in
Armageddon, we're not begging for too much I don't think
Just need a goodbye kiss before we sink

For too much I don't think, just a goodbye kiss before we sink

Armageddon, let the light in
Before we say goodbye, give us something to believe in
Armageddon, we're not begging
For too much I don't think, just one last salute before we sink
