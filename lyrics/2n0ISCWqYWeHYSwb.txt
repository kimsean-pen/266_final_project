There's someone across the street
Who sees me waiting for my friend
Then I cross the street
Make a bee-line for that phone
Oh that one to make it happen
Oh to live to find a friend

Someone tried to call me up
But I don't even have a phone
She could ask to me what's up
But I'm waiting for your call to end

There's someone across the street
Who sees me waiting for my friend
She could ask to me what's up
I'm waiting for your call to end

Someone tried to call me up
But I don't even have a phone
It's like my friends don't know I'm here
But I'm a person on my own
But I cross the street
Make a bee-line for that phone

I'm the one to make it happen
And to find a friend
I make a bee-line
Oh to find a friend
I cross the street
I make a bee-line
Oh a bee-line
Oh make a bee-line
Oh, I cross the street
