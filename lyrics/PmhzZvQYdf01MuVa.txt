You don't need a lot of money
Honey, you don't have to play no games
All I need is all your loving
To get the blood rushing through my veins, oh

I wanna say we're going steady
Like it's 1954
No, it doesn't have to be forever
Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart

Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart

You don't need to worry about making me crazy
'Cause I'm way past that, yeah
And so just call me if you want me
'Cause you got me
And I'll show you how much I want to be on your tattooed heart

Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Just as long as I'm the name, on your tattooed heart

Wrap me in your jacket, my baby
And lay me in your bed
And kiss me underneath the moonlight
Darling, let me trace the lines, on your tattooed heart

Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Just as long as I'm the name, on your tattooed heart
