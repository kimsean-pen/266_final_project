Yellow skies, I can see the yellow skies
See you again, I see you again
In my dreams, in my dreams, in my dreams, in my dreams
Morning light, I remember the morning li-i-i-i-ight
Outside my door (outside my door), I'll see you no more (see you no more)
In my dreams, in my dreams, in my dreams, in my dreams

Forever, forever I'll be, forever holding you-u-u
Forever, forever I'll be, forever holding you
Responsible, responsible, responsible, responsible, aw-aw-aw

Black and white, it's become so black and whi-i-i-i-ite
So insecure, you're so insecure
That's what you are, that's what you are
That's what you are, that's what you are

Forever, forever I'll be, forever holding you-u-u
Forever, forever I'll be, forever holding you
Responsible, responsible, responsible, responsible, aw-aw-aw

A-aw a-aw, a-aw a-aw, a-aw a-aw
Forever, forever I'll be, forever holding you-u-u
Forever, forever I'll be, forever holding you
Responsible, responsible, responsible, responsible, aw-aw-aw
