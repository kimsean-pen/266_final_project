I breathe you in with smoke
In the backyard lights
We used to laugh until we choked
Into the wasted nights
It was the best time of my life
But now I sleep alone
So don't don't don't wake me up
Cause my thrill is gone

And the sunsets turning red behind the smoke
Forever and alone
Yeahhhhh

You've gone and sewn me to this bed

The taste of you and me
Will never leave my lips again
Under the blinding rain (Blinding rain!)
I wanna hold your hand so tight
I'm gonna break my wrist

And when the vultures sing tonight
I'm gonna join right in

I'll sing along
'Cause I don't know any other song
Woah, oh no
I'll sing along
But I'm barely hanging on
No, I'm barely hanging on

By the time you're hearing this I'll already be gone
And now there's nothing to do
But scream at the drunken moon

This isn't fair (no)
Don't you try to blame this on me
My love for you was bulletproof
But you're the one who shot me
And goddamn it
I can barely say your name
So I'll try to write it and fill the pen with blood from the sink
Woahhh Ohhhh
But, don't just say it
You should sing my name
Pretend that it's a song
Cause forever it's yours
And we can sing this on the way home
I'll sing along
Cause I don't know any other song
Woah, oh no
I'll sing along
But I'm barely hanging on
No, I'm barely hanging on
By the time you're hearing this I'll already be gone
And, now, there's nothing to do
But tear my voice apart
Nothing to do
And scream at the drunken moon!
Yeeaahhh!
