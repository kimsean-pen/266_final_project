Hello there
You are all now witnesses
To a kind of confrontation
Between me and
These three men
It ain't so simple
Treason is crime
No, it ain't so simple
And here's the reasons why
This one, he always jeers me
Makes fun of my scanty head
I'll send the bears to kill him
Make the lame leap like stags
And It ain't so simple
Treason is crime
No, it ain't so simple
And here's the reasons why
This things that sits behind me
A jumped-up homunculus
O yes, he sings so sweetly
O no, he'll drown discreetly
It ain't so simple
Treason is crime
No, it ain't so simple
And here's the reasons why
Last one, the flannel acre
Everybody seems to love him
Guess I'll keep him around
Until the next song
