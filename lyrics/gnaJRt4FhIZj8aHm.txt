I came out from under her warm sheets
Into the brisk late October
If only for one last hope
I wanted my time with you to be over

I'm staring up into the sky
While all the raining is pouring down
I'm reaching out for your help
But evil beings hold me backwards

All shapes and shadows move in and out
And hover round my bed
Voices arrive and disappear
I want to talk to them

Darkness disintegrates
I'm rising; I'm rising toward a light
A light leading over hills and meadows

I've risen up from the dead
With the burning leaves of autumn
If only for one last chance
That all of whom have been defeated
To put on my father's wool coat
To smell my mother's fragrances and perfumes
To find my young brothers and sisters
To never leave or let them go

Houses adorned so beautifully
The Marin headlands song
Lost verses well up my eyes and ears
The lone mandolin strums
On Tamalpais warm spring
The many places we
Lay down in sleepy hidden shadows

I see you well and clear
Deep in the moonlight dear
Your radiant august eyes
They are the suns that rise
They are the light that guides
They are these lost verses

I came up from under the ocean
Evaporated sea salt water
A mist above the skyline
I haunt the streets of San Francisco
Watch over loved ones and old friends
I see them trough their living room windows
Shaken by fear and worries
I want them to know how I love them so
Foghorns would sound in waking
Is it my voice you hear?
Footsteps are moving across the floor
And you know I'm here
The afternoon carries up from the hills and you are well and near
To fall into the light I follow

I feel oh so near
When morning doves appear
And ghosts of April ring
Echo the refrain
Soon finding a place
In these lost verses

They fill the foggy day
They hide the hills away
That steal our time
They are the picturesque night
The casting city lights
On the bay flowing into the ocean glowing
