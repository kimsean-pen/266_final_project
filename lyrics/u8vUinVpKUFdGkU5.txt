Landing on a runway in Chicago
And I'm grounding all my dreams
Of ever really seeing California
Because I know what's in between is something sensual
Such non-conventional ways

Tonight the headphones will deliver
You the words that I can't say
Tonight the headphones will deliver
You the words that I can't say (tonight I'm writing you)
A million miles away
Tonight is all about, we miss you (miss you)
We miss you (miss you)
Tonight is all about, we miss you

And I can't forget your style or your cynicism
Somehow it was like you were the first to listen
To everything we said
My smile's an open wound without you
And my hands are tied to pages inked to bring you back

Tonight the headphones will deliver
You the words that I can't say (tonight I'm writing you)
A million miles away
Tonight is all about, we miss you (miss you)
We miss you (miss you)
Tonight is all about, we miss you, now

(These friends are, new friends are golden)
(These friends are, new friends are golden)
These friends are, new friends are golden
These friends are, new friends are-

Tonight the headphones will deliver
You the words that I can't say
Tonight the headphones will deliver
You the words that I can't say
Tonight the headphones will deliver
You the words that I can't say

These friends are, new friends are golden
