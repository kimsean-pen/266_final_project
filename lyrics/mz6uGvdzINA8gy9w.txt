Raging waters flood the valleys of your mind
The torrent washed away the warning signs

Swim through the ones and zeros
So hard to tell the villains from heroes
What if they say isn't true?
What if they want isn't best for you?

Washed up, face down on the digital shore
Lungs contract, now dive back in for more
Are you sitting on the edge of your seat?
"We'll be right back, don't move an inch"
Don't move an inch

Swim through the ones and zeros
So hard to tell the villains from heroes
Static mirror, life isn't black and white
I understand it's hard to choose what's right
Whiteout swallows us all
Once snow-blind, we won't care at all
What if they say isn't true?
What if they want isn't best for you?

Tunnel vision, hearts beat in time
Rhythmic contractions drowning in a flood of distractions

I want to wake up and find a world in remission
Free from the grasp of the human condition
But when we're all trapped inside static screens
Trained from birth just to nod and agree
I don't wanna believe that we'll be forever fast asleep

Swim through the ones and zeros
So hard to tell the villains from heroes
Static mirror, life isn't black and white
I understand it's hard to choose what's right
Whiteout swallows us all
Once snow-blind, we won't care at all
What if they say isn't true?
What if they want isn't best for you?
