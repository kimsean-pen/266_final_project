Far beyond all light
Within the black and the coldest breeze
Caressed by the dark, I had my sleep

Awakened by the moon
Nocturnal life, my powers to be
Keeping myself alive by sucking your mortals blood...

Frozen winds of immortality
as I drown in obscurity

Still feeling the taste of blood...
It makes me so strong...
I spread my wings...
Into soul winter I fly...

Tears in my eyes turns into fire
as where I belong...
The cold within, it chills my skin,
my heart and soul...
In ecstacy I shred myself
to release whats held within
In solitude Im having my pride
I, Transylvanian son...

Frozen winds of immortality
as I drown in obscurity

I fall deep into whats for me unseen
Eternal flames lick my face
In purgatory Im all within
But Im forever bound to my frozen soul...
