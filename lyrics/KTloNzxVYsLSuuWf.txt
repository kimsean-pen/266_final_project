Don't wake up, won't wake up, can't wake up
No, don't wake me up
Don't wake up, won't wake up, can't wake up
No, don't wake me up

It's the early morn, lights flick on
Sleepy eyes peek through the blinds at something wrong
Motionless remains the mess
Shame, such a beautiful, beautiful young life

And by the time I'm dreaming
And you've crept out on me sleeping
I'm busy in the blissful unaware

And by the time I'm dreaming
And you've crept out on me sleeping
Tell me how am I supposed to care

Don't wake up, won't wake up, can't wake up
No, don't wake me up
Don't wake up, won't wake up, can't wake up
No, don't wake me up

A trail of clothes, two years old
Why did you have to go and leave all this stuff behind?
Wasn't I allowed, three strikes and out
No, but you said I could, said I could just one night

And by the time I'm dreaming
And you've crept out on me sleeping
I'm busy in the blissful unaware

And by the time I'm dreaming
And you've crept out on me sleeping
Tell me how am I supposed to care

Would I let you go, let you go?
Could this be different, different?
Now I'll never know, never know
I didn't get the chance, damn you

Would I let you go, let you go?
Could this be different, different?
Now I'll never know, never know
I didn't get the chance, damn you

And by the time I'm dreaming
And you've crept out on me sleeping
I'm busy in the blissful unaware

And by the time I'm dreaming
And you've crept out on me sleeping
Tell me how am I supposed to care

Don't wake up, won't wake up, can't wake up
No, don't wake me up
Don't wake up, won't wake up, can't wake up
No, don't wake me up

Don't wake up, won't wake up, can't wake up
No, don't wake me up
Don't wake up, won't wake up, can't wake up
No, don't wake me up
