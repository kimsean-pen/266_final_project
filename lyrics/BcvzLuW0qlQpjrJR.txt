I was 19 and you were 23
We stayed in long before Ferdinand Street
We spent five talking about our lives
But we'd talked like that about a thousand times
And I'm bored of all that

You used to tell me that
Love is a lottery
And you got your numbers
And you're betting on me
You used to say that
Love is a game
But you got your numbers
And you're betting on me

I'll tell you about a guy
That I've been with
And you ask how
"Old as he?"
And I left
"26, no but–"
He's 30
How messed up is that?
"Won't forget it" he says
"I'm a jealous man
And I don't want to talk about that"

You used to tell me that
Love is a lottery
But you got your numbers
And you're betting on me
You used to say that
Love is a game
But you got your numbers
And you're betting on me
Are you still betting on me?

Hold on, my dear
Hold on real tight
It's just a numbers game
In my mind
And we've been here a thousand times
A thousand times
A thousand–

You used to tell me that
Love is a lottery
And you got your numbers
And you're betting on me
You used to say that
Love is a game
But you got your numbers
And you'll play it anyway
You used to tell me that
Love is a lottery
But you got your numbers
And you're betting on me
You used to tell me that
Love is a lottery
But you got your numbers
And you're betting on me
Are you still betting on me?
