Losing trust in human touch
It's honest like a liar's love
Disappear as hands draw near
Avoid the longing sense of being one you trust

Don't count on me
I'm not what you need
Don't count on me
I'm not what you need

Ostracized, a loss of pride
There's only shadows on my side
Lessons learned: no one's concern
Lends itself to wounds that won't repair with time

Don't count on me
I'm not what you need
Don't count on me
I'm not what you need

Temporary, but can't be erased
Pushed away to a darker place
