I wanna talk to the ladies tonight
About situation I'm pretty sure y'all be able to relate to
Trust me

Today I'm not feelin pretty
See I'm feeling quite ugly
Havin one of those days
When I cant make up my mind
So don't even look at me
See I don't wanna hear your problems
Cause I'm having some of my own
I know its not your fault
That I'm feelin down
I just wanna be left alone

Down, I'm now in depression
I think the worst of everything
My lower back is aching
And my clothes dont fit
Now aint that a bitch

Got an attitude and I aint talkin to you
only if the shoe fits
I don't care what you think about me
I don't need you crowd around me
I don't need it, no no
PMS

Going through something at night
some in the day

I don't need to understand
Where I'm coming from tonight
See I'm PMSin'
Told you, you would be able to relate tonight
my lower back is aching
PMS

And I don't know what I'm gonna do next
I'm full of stress
I want y'all to hear what I'm sayin
PMS, PMS, PMS

Understand what I'm sayin tonight
Understand where I'm comin from
Feelin really bitchy yeah
And I don't feel like be a nice to nobody
Don't feel like smilin no
Don't feel like smilin no no
See I already know that I'm talkin
PMS

And I don't need you to remind me
See cause PMS
Is takin over right now
if you understand, understand where I'm comin from
Sing along, PMS
This is the worst part of everything
The worst part of being a woman is PMS
Give me a break, give me a break
Cause I don't wanna have to set it off tonight
