Yellow lilies light
The house where we used live
Where we used to go
When I was more out there
We watch them grow
Like our lives they grew everywhere
And now it's old and it withered, withered
They withered
They withered, withered

And so I let them go
Let go, oh oh
I watched the lilies grow until they got old
(Until they got old)

The lilies, the lillies
The lilies grow until they got old
The lilies, the lillies
The lilies grow until they got old (Until they got us)
The lilies
Until they got old (Until they got us)
The lilies

The lilies
The lilies
Lilies grow until they got old (they got old)
The lilies
