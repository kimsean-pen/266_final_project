My baby a kind hearted woman, so lovely and so sweet she's so kind
Yeah, she's a kind hearted woman, so lovely and so sweet she's so kind
She's got such a cool disposition,
she just makes me love her all the time
She got me doin' things, peoples I just can't sleep at night
She got me doin' things, you know boys I just can't sleep at night
I don't eat my breakfast in the mornin',
and my teeth and tongue begin to fight
Yes, she's 41 through the shoulders, 29 in the waist
I'll never find another woman, to take my baby's place
She's so lovin', she's so sweet she's so kind
She's got such a cool disposition, makes me love her all the time
