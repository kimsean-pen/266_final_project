Oh, I promise I didn't know he was your man
I would've noticed a gold wedding band, Diane
I'd rather you hate me than not understand
Oh, Diane

You pick the time and the place
Don't know how much this hurts
I gave him my heart to break
Now I know he broke yours first

Lying right there in my bed
While he was lying to you
Believing the words that he said
How could we be such fools?

And all those nights that he's given to me
I wish that I could give them back to you
Diane
I promise I didn't know he was your man

I would've noticed a gold wedding band, Diane
I'd rather you hate me than not understand
Oh, Diane

You can blame me if it helps
That's what a good wife would do
But you're only cheating yourself
Choosing him over the truth

And all those nights that he's given to me
I wish that I could give them back to you
Diane
I promise I didn't know he was your man

I would've noticed a gold wedding band, Diane
I'd rather you hate me than not understand
Oh, Diane

Oh oh, Diane, Diane
Oh oh, Diane
Oh, I'd rather you hate me that not understand
Oh, Diane
And all those nights that he's given to me
I wish that I could give them back to you
