Doesn't matter how you sell me
I am just another number
Even when it's not for money
Use me like a cash register
You fool me once fool me twice, but the ends don't meet
Do you really think I'm dumb, dumb
I wanna know how you figure

What's in it for me
What's in it for me
What's in it for me
Doesn't matter how much you sugar the fluff
What's in it for me
What's in it for me
What's in it for me
Doesn't matter how much you sugar the fluff

Never really had to play this
Feeling out my alter ego
Hustling to your agenda
No gracias, mi amigo
You fool me once fool me twice, but the ends don't meet
Do you really think I'm dumb, dumb
Watch me go Evel Knievel

What's in it for me
What's in it for me
What's in it for me
Doesn't matter how much you sugar the fluff
What's in it for me
What's in it for me
What's in it for me
Doesn't matter how much you sugar the fluff

Every time you call up, I'mma put my wall up
Always a dilemma with the drama that you drum up
Even the bologna, part of your persona
Traded me a dollar for a floor of Smithsoneon
Undecided of whether you got it down yet
Undivided attention to how your brow sweats
How can I trust you, I'll be losing all bets
It's a gamble, I don't wanna pull yet
Paying me in jelly, beans in the belly
When you get nervous I can tell by the smelly
Do me Blue Bonnet, butter me up on it
You can toast love notes, I can burn sonnets
It's apparent I needed to say no
Throw a karat of diamonds on the floor
How can I trust you, all you want is more
I gotta bust you, this means war

You come around here flipping your tricks
I'm letting down my wall my bricks
Least you can do is riddle me this
What's in it for me?

What's in it for me
What's in it for me
What's in it for me
Doesn't matter how much you sugar the fluff
What's in it for me
What's in it for me
What's in it for me
Doesn't matter how much you sugar the fluff
