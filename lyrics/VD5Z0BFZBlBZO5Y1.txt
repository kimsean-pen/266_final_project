Well, I put so much thought into getting ready
Now I know that was the best part
It's so easy to get caught up in what I'm regretting
Forget what I got from a wounded heart

I'm the one who likes gardenia
I'm the one who likes to make love on the floor
I don't wanna hang up the phone yet
It's been good getting to know me more

I've been seeing all my old friends in the city
And walking alone in Central Park
Doing all the things that I neglected
I traded 'em all in to be in your arms

I'm the one who likes gardenia
I'm the one who likes to make love on the floor
I don't wanna hang up the phone yet
It's been good getting to know me more

Well, I hear my own voice, it sounds so silly
I keep on telling my story all around
And everything I lost seems so different
'Coz this is how everybody gets found

I'm the one who likes gardenia
Oh, I'm the one who likes to make love on the floor
And I don't wanna hang up the phone yet
It's been good getting to know me more
