Rejoice at marble feet built by craving hands
So pure for mass destruction and delight
The sightless wait to touch
To lead is one by one to follow is enough
It's the oversoul it consoles your lonely mind
Sense of blind affection can radiate
Surround in warmth
The infinite spirit helps create the brighter life
Because it seeps into the cracks it melts you down
To lead is one by one to follow is enough
It's the oversoul it consoles your lonely mind
Rejoice at marble feet
