I want free,
I want changed,
I want it written on my grave,
and no the stone's not gonna read liar that died living in his cage

I'm sick of being angry at all the wrong things keeping my head down to get through another day
How much time have I spent yelling at people that don't exist
I'm sick of being hopeless at all the wrong times.
Living a letdown, living a lie.
I can't be wrong.
Not this time.

I just wanna live free
(Live free) They won't get the best of me
(Live free) I don't need your sympathy
You may spark the flame but these scars will not remain
You'll never burn me out

It's really getting old writing negative songs, beating myself up to get another word out.
How much time have I lost
yelling about all the pain I feel
There's gotta be an answer gotta be a fix.
Find the pieces, take the risk.
I won't go down
not like this

I just wanna live free
(Live free) They won't get the best of me
(Live free) I don't need your sympathy
You may spark the flame but these scars will not remain
You'll never burn me out

You'll never burn me

(Live free) They won't get the best of me
(Live free) I don't need your sympathy

(Live free) They won't get the best of me
(Live free) I don't need your sympathy
You may spark the flame
But these scars will not remain
You'll never burn me out

You'll never burn me.
