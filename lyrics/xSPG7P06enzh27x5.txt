You have forsaken
All the love you've taken
Sleeping on a razor
There's nowhere left to fall

Your body's aching
Every bone is breaking
Nothing seems to shake it
It just keeps holding on

Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah

Your soul is able
Death is all you cradle
Sleeping on the nails
There's nowhere left to fall

You have admired
Every man desires
Everyone is king
When there's no one left to pawn

Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah

There is no peace here
War is never cheap, dear
Love will never meet here
It just gets sold for parts

You cannot fight it
All the world denies it
Open up your eyelids, let your demons run
Ah, ah

Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
I thread the needle through

You beat the devil's tattoo
I thread the needle through
You beat the devil's tattoo
I thread the needle through
You beat the devil's tattoo
I thread the needle through
You beat the devil's tattoo
I bled the needle through
You beat the devil's tattoo
I thread the needle through
You beat the devil's tattoo
I bled the needle through
You beat the devil's tattoo
I thread the needle through
You beat the devil's tattoo
