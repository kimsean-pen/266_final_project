Back of the woods with the fire glowing
Behind the barn, burning slowly
Set the fire, set the timber
Burn it down to ash and cinder

Turn me on dead man (x10)
Oh, you turn me on

Back of the house, down the steps
Under the cellar door we crept
Brought the doors, brought the windows
Set a match to scarecrow tinder

Turn me on dead man (x10)
You turn me on

Out of my head
Out of my tree
Out of my stuff drip out of me

Burn down the house
Burn down the barn
Burning down the entire farm
Cross the fields, fallow garden
Watch the scarecrow, forever autumn

Turn me on dead man (x10)
You turn me on

(To be done?) we'll keep our bargain
You and I forever autumn

Turn me on dead man (x7)
You turn me on
You turn me on
Turn me on dead man
