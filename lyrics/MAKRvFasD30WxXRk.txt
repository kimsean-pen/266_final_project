Try to keep you,
Try to wrap you up and save the feeling
For when I really start to need you
You don't belong to anybody, not even me
I need to be alone,
With someone
I need to delve into the dark,
With the light on

Training wheels to human shields,
Can you hold my hand?
My thoughts alone are heavy,
Can you hold my head?

I'm just a piece of a two part puzzle,
Nothing on my own, only happy when I'm loving someone
Happy when I'm loving someone
I'm drinking singles, but I see double
Lonely, but I know I'll be happy when I'm loving someone
Happy when I'm loving someone

So I just wait,
Try to give you time to want the same things
Say you don't believe in soulmates,
I know it's real 'cause I feel the hole in me

Training wheels to human shields
Can you hold my hand?
Can you hold my heart?
Can you hold my head?

I'm just a piece of a two part puzzle
Nothing on my own, only happy when I'm loving someone
Happy when I'm loving someone
I'm drinking singles, but I see double
Lonely, but I know I'll be happy when I'm loving someone
Happy when I'm loving someone

I'm only happy when I'm loving, happy when I'm loving someone
I'm only happy when I'm loving, happy when I'm loving someone
I'm only happy when I'm loving, happy when I'm loving someone
I'm only happy when I'm loving, happy when I'm loving someone

I'm just a piece of a two part puzzle
Nothing on my own, only happy when I'm loving someone
Happy when I'm loving someone
I'm drinking singles, but I see double
Lonely, but I know I'll be happy when I'm loving someone
Happy when I'm loving someone

I'm only happy when I'm loving, happy when I'm loving someone
I'm only happy when I'm loving, happy when I'm loving someone
