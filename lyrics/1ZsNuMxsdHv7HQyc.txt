If you're not bleeding you're not drained out
If I don't know you, you get X'd out
I've just been planning how to get out
I'm letting go you're being let down

I'm in the darkness with a rag on
I'm looking for you for the last time
If you're not bleeding you not drained out
If you're not bleeding your not drained out
Don't lose your face hanging with some lames
I lost my brain smoking toxic waste
The water sprayed with MDMA
I'm with the drain they won't go away
Don't lose your ways you can get betrayed
I'm in the shade but I'm making plays
My bodies late but I'm on my way
Go to the club gonna celebrate

If you're not bleeding you're not drained out
If I don't know you, you get X'd out
I've just been planning how to get out
I'm letting go you're being let down

Your friends talk behind your back
They told me they don't fuck with you
I didn't even ask
They wanna be Drain Gang but they can't
[?] when you switch up on your man
Catching all those feelings, catch my hands
I don't catch emotions I'ma cash out in the bank
Chillin' at the roof you look like ants
You don't know what I've been through
You'll never understand

My heart, where did it go?
My heart, where did it go?
Nobody knows

If you're not bleeding you're not drained out
If I don't know you, you get X'd out
I've just been planning how to get out
I'm letting go you're being let down
