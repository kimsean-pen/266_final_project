I don't know if there's anything here we could do or say
Time to go, I wish so much that you came along my way
But we both know we should move on further and we can not stay
River flows and we'll float on okay and we will seize the day, oh

Morning time wake up early summer, sun is by my bed
Move the line where we cross the border into a foreign land
When drive though night moving further up and we release the day
Border line, I wish so much that you came along with me, oh
