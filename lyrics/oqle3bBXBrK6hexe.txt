Come on come on
Hurry up Harry come on
Come on come on
Hurry up Harry come on
We're going down the pub
We're going down the pub

Now listen here Harry
If we're going down the pub
You'd better tell your mum and dad
And finish up your grub
I wish you'd listen to me
No, I don't want a cup of tea

Come on come on
Hurry up Harry come on
Come on come on
Hurry up Harry come on
We're going down the pub
We're going down the pub

You're telling me to grow up
But Harry don't you see
If I tried to act my age
I wouldn't be me
We never do anything
So now's the time to begin

Come on come on
Hurry up Harry come on
Come on come on
Hurry up Harry come on
We're going down the pub
We're going down the pub

You don't have to tell me
That the thing's I do are wrong
But everything I do in life
Is with us right or wrong
Now I think I understand
How to have some fun

Come on come on
Hurry up Harry come on
Come on come on
Hurry up Harry come on
We're going down the pub
We're going down the pub
