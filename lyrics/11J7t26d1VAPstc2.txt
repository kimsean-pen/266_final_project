Yeah
Rest in peace to all the kids that lost their lives in the Parkland shooting
This song is dedicated to you

Okay, she keep callin', she keep callin' every single night
Day and night, on my mind, please don't kill the vibe
Oh no, I swear to God, I be in my mind
Swear I wouldn't die, yeah, we ain't gonna
Said I wouldn't die, yuh
No, I'm not alright, yuh
I might start a riot
I'm so fuckin' tired
So what's up? What you say?
Feelin' good, I'm feelin' great
Tired of the fuckin' hate
Stackin' cheese all on my plate

So outside of my misery, I think I'll find
A way of envisioning a better life
For the rest of us, the rest of us
There's hope for the rest of us, the rest of us

Okay, she keep callin', she keep callin' every single night
Day and night, on my mind, please don't kill the vibe
Oh no, I swear to God, I be in my mind
Swear I wouldn't die, yeah, we ain't gonna
Said I wouldn't die, yuh
No, I'm not alright, yuh
I might start a riot
I'm so fuckin' tired
So what's up? What you say?
Feelin' good, I'm feelin' great
Tired of the fuckin' hate
Stackin' cheese all on my plate
