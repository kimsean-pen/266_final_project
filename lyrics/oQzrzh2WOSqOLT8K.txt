Let's not get lost in the deep hell
Not while i'm catching my breath

I don't think I can do this no more
I'm only saying
You keep trying to break down my wall
Your mama left you

Hardcore, Hardcore
I don't think i can do this no more

Your brother said he locked you in the bedroom
Your sister said she throw away the key
But nothing in the world can stop you
Hell no not even me

I don't think i can do this no more
I'm only saying
You keep trying to break down the wall
You think you're

Hardcore, Harcore
I don't think i can do this
No more

Everytime I think I can get like this

I just can't do it anymore
You keep trying to break down my wall
You just think you're

Hardcore, Hardcore
I don't think i can do this anymore
I'm only saying
You keep trying to break down my wall
Your mama left you
You think you're

Hardcore, Hardcore
I don't think i can do this no more.
