It's unexplainable
the way that you talk about me at all
about me at all

You're so relatable
Your talking gets like I was alone
like I was alone

But I don't like the ocean in my eyes

You like your daughter sober

You were right about me
I'll never get that bag from the lake
that bag from the lake

Later on you said we'd
carpet up that place on the floor
that place on the floor

You're calling back a lightweight
It's different than you wanted
