You gotta live a little
You gotta give a little
We've got a long, cold history
If I seem uncomfortable
It's because you're just too close to me
Past the living room
A rose-tinted tomb
And a ghost staring back at me
If it seems impossible
It's because you don't believe

Memories (memories, memories) lie
Memories (memories)
Memories (memories) lie

In a little while
I'll be out of style
Out of grace and reality
When I feel disposable
I'll pretend it meant something to me
Everyone you see
Passing on the street
Plays a part in a tragedy
When it's too uncomfortable
We can rewrite history

Memories (memories, memories) lie
Memories (memories, memories) lie
Memories (memories, memories) lie
Memories (memories)
Memories (memories) lie
