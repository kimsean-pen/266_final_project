I woke up to a heart attack
No I'm just being dramatic
It's this massive panic
That's fueling my heart rate
It's racing and I'm manic

Have you ever had the feeling
When you just don't wanna breath
And you can't stand up without leaning
And there's nothing to believe in
Have you ever walked outside
And felt like you might throw up
Right beside your car
Before you even get inside

Every day of my

Day of my
Day of my life ...
I don't wanna be dependent
On synthetic medicine
That keeps me calm enough to sleep
But kills me softly when I'm weak
Have you ever looked beyond the eyes
Of someone else's life
And thought that you were fine
Until you turned crazy over night
Every day of my
Day of my
Day of my life ...
Day of my
Day of my
Day of my life Every day of my
Day of my
Day of my life
