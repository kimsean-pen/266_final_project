One day my prayers are gonna be answered
So long I've been hungry for something else
Where there's a will and there's a way
I work hard 'couse at the end of the day
The Lord helps those who help themselves

Hey, hey I keep my head down
But I keep on swingin
Hey I keep my head down
But I keep on swingin
Hey I keep my head down
But I keep on swingin
Hey I keep my head down
But I keep on swingin

Right now somebody's counting my money
So much that they can't see the top of the stack
There's a will, there's away
Moneys gonna find my hand one day and
When it does I ain't looking back

Hey, hey I keep my head down
But I keep on swingin
Hey I keep my head down
But I keep on swingin
Hey I keep my head down
But I keep on swingin
Hey I keep my head down
But I keep on

Hey, hey I keep my head down
But I keep on swingin
Hey I keep my head down
I keep on swingin
Hey I keep my head down
But I keep on swingin
Hey I keep my head down
But I keep on swingin
Hey I keep my head down
But I keep on swingin
Hey I keep my head down
But I keep on swingin

(Keep on swingin) Yeah, I keep on swingin
(Keep on swingin) Keep on, keep on
(Keep on swingin) Keep on swingin
(Keep on swingin)
