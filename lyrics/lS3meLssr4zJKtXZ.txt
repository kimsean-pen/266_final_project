I'll never forget the first time I realized
That the darkness in me can be lightning in the night
Shooting fire 'cross the sky, burnin' out
And changing lives, yeah they can try, I'll never die
I'll never forget the first time I saw the truth
That the power in me, it shines brighter than the moon
Every dream that I see, it becomes reality
Yeah they can try, I'll never die
Feel this forever, let it carry on
Forever, forever, forever
Feel this forever, even when you're gone
Forever, forever, forever, ever, ever
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, forever
I'm lost in the rush, that keeps rushing through my veins
Oh who needs love, who needs love
When the people scream your name
I'm the one, only one who can save us from all the pain
Yeah, they can try, I'll never die
Feel this forever, let it carry on
Forever, forever, forever
Feel this forever, even when you're gone
Forever, forever, forever
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, forever
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, forever
The future brings, champion rings, on every finger
You gotta take some time to let the gold just linger
Going gold, yeah solid gold, no time for silver
Look in these eyes, these stealing eyes, and watch them shimmer
The purple haze fill up the days, awards the feeling
Walls of stone, they came to home of new beginnings
The moment's now, the broken place, we're dreaming bigger
The future brings, champion rings, on every finger
Feel this forever, let it carry on
Forever, forever, forever
Feel this forever, even when you're gone
Forever, forever, forever
Feel this forever, let it carry on
Forever, forever, forever
Feel this forever, even when you're gone
Forever, forever, forever
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, forever
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, forever
