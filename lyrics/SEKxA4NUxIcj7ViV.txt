Ghost eyes fall upon my baby doll
Ghost eyes love to watch me too
Ghost eyes don't say much but they see it all, yeah

Ghost eyes sleep beside my baby doll
All night when I'm in bed with you
Sunrise never sets on baby doll
Her ghost tears, some call it rain
Well I'm crying for just one name

I made it up in a dream I had
My French is bad, some say "Je t'aime beaucoup"
I say, my darling "Shavambacu"
I can't stand to see another day
I'm not in L.A. to have my way with you
My little darling shavambacu, oh honey I love you

Her ghost eyes float around my empty room
Do your eyes, but I can't tell it's you
Where I try, but I can't see for baby doll
Her ghost tears, some call it rain
Well I'm crying for just one name

I made it up in a dream I had
My French is bad, some say "Je t'aime beaucoup"
I say, my darling "Shavambacu"
I can't stand to see another day
I'm not in L.A. to have my way with you
My little darling shavambacu, oh honey I love you

Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da
To have my way with you
My little darling shavambacu
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da
To have my way with you, yeah
My little darling shavambacu, oh honey I love you
