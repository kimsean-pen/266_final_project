If there was a chance
That we could be lovers
I'd write you a book
Of handwritten letters
And burn them all up to the air
Just to start over again

If there was a chance
That we could be lovers
I'd learn how to dance
And to hold without touching
Oh love
Where have you been
I'll wait for your lead to come in

So tell me the secret
Is there a way into your heart
'Cause I want to believe it
Or will I be wishing
Until the last falling star

If there was a chance
That we could be lovers
I'd swim seven oceans
And keep going further
I'd hold my breath until
You slipped those words
That belong on your lips

So tell me the secret
Is there a way into your heart
'Cause I want to believe it
Or will I be wishing
Until the last falling star

Say a line
Could be anything
Just stay with me
Tonight

So tell me the secret
Is there a way into your heart
'Cause I want to believe it
Or will I be wishing
I'll keep on wishing
Until the last falling star
