The body descends, I should have let it
the strongest love I've felt in my life
she said 'I was born into this life to suffer
and suffer I will
but if you had to do it all again
without knowing you'd make it through
do you think you'd make it?
no, I don't think I would'
my heart is the leaves
my body the trees
& it's Halloween
Two thousand eight
I'm strung out again
my body descends
& I'm having this dream
every night
a room with a view
a room with some light
a stoic front porch
some mountains outside.
I am what I'm not, my problems are God's
when the body descends, we both sit and watch
& the strongest love I've felt in my life
rises up from the dark
to pull me aside
& across the room
& out in the hall
& outside my house
& out in the yard
