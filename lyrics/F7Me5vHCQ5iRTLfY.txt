I found out
You were
In a mess
You caught me playin songs for you
Lipstick stains
On your ciggarettes
You caught me playin songs for you
And it's bending my mind again
Interesting how you watch the night
And look right through me
Facing the sky
When I ask you why
You look right through me
Climbed the fire to the hidaway
You caught me slipping on a thought
Practical in the things you say
You caught me slipping on a thought
And it's bending my mind again
Interesting how you watch the night
And look right through me
Facing the sky
When I ask you why
You look right through me
We get lucky and
Turned around the space you got to find yourself
We slip up when we haven't found
The space you got to find yourself
And it's bending my mind again
Interesting how you watch the night
And look right through me
