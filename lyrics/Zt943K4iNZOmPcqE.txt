Time stands still in these ancient halls
Only the castle itself can tell what it keeps
Dark are the secrets between these walls
Hidden in shadows of death, while the sorcerer sleeps

Where is the morning
Where is the sun
Thousand years of midnight
The sunrise is gone

An old man marked by a life so long
Is sleeping so sweet while his magic is growing so strong
Waiting still for new times to come
A thousands years to see if he has won

Where is the morning
Where is the sun
A thousand years of midnight

The sunrise is gone
I
What has he done?
Why is he sleeping so long?
He wants to live for evermore

Soon is he young
And will he open his eyes?
When he is strong enough to rule

Back in our time goes the legend
Of a sorcerer so old
He drank the blood of the virgin to be reborn

Soon a tyrant will conquer
So spoke the wise
Of the day when the sorcerer will rise

Blood is his wine
The sorcerer is cheating on time
And he'll be stronger than before

Cursed be the sun
The women will weep for his fun
In the name of his magic so strong

A thousand years have gone
Armageddon hasn't come
Only the cry of a child echoes in the dark
Wards goes time
As the stars are passing by
And nothing remains of this foolishman except his fate
