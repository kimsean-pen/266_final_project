Waste all my time,
Could I believe you never know?
Your presence sublime, Oh-Oh,
I know ill need you evermore, Wo-oah

But on a sunday morning sun,
Well I don't, I don't believe in your loving.
When all thing sort of fall inside,
Well I don't, I don't believe in, in all your loving.

(Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh)
Breathe it all in Love some mind,
Set it off your feet will fall,
Leaves a hole in rough your mind,

Certain of no harm no foul.
We saw the line,
And took the time to make it fall,
We left her behind, Oh-Oh

I know you need it all.
But on a Sunday morning sun,
I don't, I don't believe in your loving,
When all things sort of fall inside,
Well I don't, I don't believe in, your loving.
(Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh)
But on a Sunday morning sun,
Solo Sunrise.
Breathe it all in Love some mind (Close your mind),
Set it off your feet will fall (Your feet will fall),
Leaves a hole in rough your mind (Hole in rough, Your Mi-ind),
Set it off your feet will fall (No Harm No Foul).
No foul, No foul,
(Breathe it all in, Close your mind)
No foul, No foul.
Set it off your feet will fall (Your feet will fall)
But on a Sunday morning Sun,
(Leaves a hole in rough your mind)
Solo Sunrise. (Set it off your feet will fall).
