Get down and do it again
Get down and do it again
Get down and do it again
And again and again and again

So when does it all start making sense
So where do we break down our defence

I feel like breaking down the wall
I guess itÂ's up to you now
IÂ'm getting oh so sick of it all
Oh I feel like I can take the pain so come on start over again
Come on take me once again

Get down and do it again
Get down and do it again
Get down and do it again
And again and again and again

So when does it all start making sense
So where do we break down our defence

I feel like breaking down the wall
I guess itÂ's up to you now
IÂ'm getting oh so sick of it all
Oh I feel like I can take the pain so come on start over again
Come on take me once again

Parararapapa, parararapapa, parararapapa, parararapapa
Parararapapa, parararapapa, parararapapa, parararapapa

Get down and do it again
Get Down
So where do we break down our defence

I feel like breaking down the wall
I guess itÂ's up to you now
IÂ'm getting oh so sick of it all
Oh I feel like I can take the pain so come on start over again

Co Come on take me once again
Co Come on take me once again
Co Come on take me once again
So Come on take me once again
