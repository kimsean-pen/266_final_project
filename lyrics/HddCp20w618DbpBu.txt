I remember when I was so much younger
Hanging outside with my brother
Breathing on a Hypercolor shirt
And watch it changing color
Friends that you had to find
Couldn't get them all online
In my room I played guitar
Only played Oasis and Nir-
Vana, na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na
Still takes me back to better days

I miss the days of ditching school to watch The Goonies
When cigarettes would cost me less than the movies
And every day, it slips away so far behind me
God I miss the nineties

Those days are gone
And I miss them so
Good songs on the radio
Rocking out to Smashing Pumpkins
Black and White, Macaulay Culkin
Na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na
Still takes me back to better days

I miss the days of after school at Roller City
Now all we've got is a parking lot, it's such a pity
And used to pray we'd meet one day Kelly Kapowski
God I miss the nineties
I'll always miss the nineties

I miss the days of ditching school to watch The Goonies
And cigarettes would cost me less than the movies
And every day, it slips away so far behind me
God I miss the nineties
God I miss the nineties
I'll forever miss the nineties
