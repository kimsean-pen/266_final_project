Cruel and cold like winds on the sea
Will you ever return to me
Hear my voice sing with the tide
My love will never die

Over waves and deep in the blue
I will give up my heart for you
Ten long years I'll wait to go by
My love will never die

Come, my love, be one with the sea
Rule with me for eternity
Drown all dreams so mercilessly
And leave their souls to me

Play the song you sang long ago
And wherever the storm may blow
You will find the key to my heart
We'll never be apart

Wild and strong you can't be contained
Never bound nor ever chained
Wounds you caused will never mend
And you will never end

Cruel and cold like winds on the sea
will you ever return to me
Hear my voice sing with the tide
Our love will never die
