Have you lost your way?
Living in the shadow of the messes that you made
And so it goes
Everything inside your circle starts to overflow

Take a step before you leap
Into the colors that you seek
You get back what you give away
So don't look back on yesterday

Wanna scream out
No more hiding
Don't be afraid of what's inside
Gonna tell ya, you'll be alright
In the aftermath
Anytime anybody pulls you down
Anytime anybody says you're not allowed
Just remember you are not alone
In the aftermath

You feel the weight
Of lies and contradictions that you live with every day
It's not too late
Think of what could be if you rewrite the role you play

Take a step before you leap
Into the colors that you seek
You'll get back what you give away
So don't look back on yesterday

Wanna scream out
No more hiding
Don't be afraid of what's inside
Gonna tell ya, you'll be alright
In the aftermath
Anytime anybody pulls you down
Anytime anybody says you're not allowed
Just remember you are not alone
In the aftermath
In the aftermath

Before you break you have to shed your armour
Take a trip and fall into the glitter
Tell a stranger that they're beautiful
So all you feel is love, love
All you feel is love, love

Wanna scream out
No more hiding
Don't be afraid of what's inside
Gonna tell ya, you'll be alright
In the aftermath

Wanna scream out
No more hiding
Don't be afraid of what's inside
Gonna tell ya, you'll be alright
In the aftermath

Anytime anybody pulls you down
Anytime anybody says you're not allowed
Just remember you are not alone
In the aftermath
In the aftermath (going to tell you you'll be alright)
In the sftermath
In the aftermath
Just remember you are not alone
In the aftermath
