Those days, where were we to go?
Stumbling down the empty streets that will swallow in us whole.
Breathing was the thing, we traversed this hazy mountain pass.
Sipping harsh elixir, nights above us melting fast.

I'm coming home.
It's been so long.
I'm coming home.

Held fast the ship that board us forth.
Enveloped in the darkness, buried frosty dreams in all.
Spoke to me in slumber, fleeing on the wings of dawn.
Ember flame arising, we better journey on.

I'm coming home.
I'm coming home.
