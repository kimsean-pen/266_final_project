You shout from the roof that you know something better
And you run 'til you prove
To a fault to your failure, it's a knife
Only safe when it don't shine

I say you will see it clearly give it some time
I say you will leave all of your failure behind

Take it out
Take it out
Take it out on me baby
Take it out
Take it out
Take it out on me baby

You shake to the beat, you heard it slow
And it washes of the weight of default and what's severe
You're the only one tonight
In the absence of the light

I say you will hit the bottom harder each time
I say you can leave all of your failure behind

Take it out
Take it out
Take it out on me baby
Take it out
Take it out
Take it out on me baby
Take it out on me baby
Take it out on me baby
