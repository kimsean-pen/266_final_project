Digging down, digging down, digging down in the dirt
Sweat it out, sweat it out 'till it doesn't burn
In the dark, in the dark it can hear when I breathe
And now it's closing in on me

It's getting louder now, it's getting louder now
Don't make another sound (I can feel it coming alive)
It's getting closer now, it's getting closer now
It's gonna run me down (I can feel it coming alive)
I can feel it coming alive
I can feel it coming

Take me to my grave, save me
I can feel it alive
Chain me to my cage, save me
I can feel it coming alive

Trying to feel, trying to heal, trying to kill the disease
Picking flesh, picking bone from between my teeth
No more sleep, no more sleep when you run with the beast
(No more sleep, no more sleep) Now they're closing in on me

It's getting louder now, it's getting louder now
Don't make another sound (I can feel it coming alive)
It's getting closer now, it's getting closer now
Don't let it take me out (I can feel it coming alive)

Take me to my grave, save me
I can feel it coming alive
Chain me to my cage, save me
I can feel it coming alive
I can feel it coming alive
I can feel it coming alive

It's killing me, killing me, killing me, killing me, killing me
It's killing me slow, killing me slow
It's killing me, killing me, killing me, killing me, killing me
It's killing me slow, killing me slow
It's killing me, killing me, killing me, killing me, killing me
It's killing me slow, killing me slow

Take me to my grave, save me
I can feel it coming alive
Chain me to my cage, save me
I can feel it coming alive
(From the inside out)
I can feel it coming alive
(From the inside out)
I can feel it coming alive
I can feel it coming alive
Yeah, I can feel it coming alive
