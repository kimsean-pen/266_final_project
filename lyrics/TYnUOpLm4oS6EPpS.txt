Sweat on skin
A will too thin
Hell at heaven's door
Trembling an' ain't no lie
Worlds end within your eyes
Love's a holy war

Tongue-tied mouth
Reckless doubt
Every inch you know
Killing me in each breath
Song of the sweetest death
Still the fires grow

Ooh ooh ooh
All for just one taste
Ooh ooh ooh
Armageddon waits
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Oooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Oooh ooh ooh

Lost in this
Head-trip kiss
Burn us to the ground
Gone in the sweetest rush
Fear in the loudest hush
Murmuring the sound

Ooh ooh ooh
All for just one taste
Ooh ooh ooh
Armageddon waits
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Oooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Oooh ooh ooh

Ooh yeah
Ooh
Ooh...
