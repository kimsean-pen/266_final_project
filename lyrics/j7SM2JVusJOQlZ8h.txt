Don't turn your back on me now
I've seen it coming for a while
Don't turn your back on me now
This man is not an isle

A wandering man I've always been
Walking the outsides looking in
A wandering man I've always been
I still chase a home in the wind

Even if every word is a lie
All poison and sharp teeth
Even if every word is a lie
I still hear your cries beneath

Like blood spilt upon the ground
Brings the earth to life anew
I spill my blood upon the ground
And I revive my roots to you

The Leaves may have fallen
and the branches left to rot
But we're still bound together
heart to heart, root to root

Roots grown strong as life
All intertwined and tied
Roots grown strong as life
Still withers under pride

In a world that wants us dead
And burnt from the ground
In a world that wants us dead
It's kin where hope is found
