When I leave this skin and bone
Beyond my final heartbeat
I'll dismantle piece by piece
And I will know that death is not defeat

When I leave this skin and bone
Beyond my final heartbeat
I'll dismantle piece by piece
And I will know that death is not defeat

Holding on tight to what's left of our time
We've hidden away, but it's in the design
Why do we fight what we can't define?
Don't be afraid, we all cross the same line

When I leave this skin and bone
Beyond my final heartbeat
I'll dismantle piece by piece
And I will know that death is not defeat

Into the night we burn and rage
In death, we repay for time on this stage
The lights are bright, but don't lose your way
'Cause once it ignites, the flame must decay

Now you're finally complete
I will see you where oceans meet
Past and present merge, light and dark will converge
Time will overthrow our, our reign on this throne
The everlasting sleep returning through the veil
Far beneath the deep, another soul sets sail

When I leave this skin and bone
Beyond my final heartbeat
I'll dismantle piece by piece
And I will know that death is not defeat
When I leave this skin and bone
Beyond my final heartbeat
I'll dismantle piece by piece
And I will know that death is not defeat
