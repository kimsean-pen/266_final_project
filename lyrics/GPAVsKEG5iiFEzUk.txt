They gave me a life that's not so easy to live
And then they sent me on my way
I left my love and forgot my dreams
I lost them all along the way

Those little things you say
When words mean so much
You never back down
And they all shy away
You always listen to me

And what do I get
To get me through these sleepless nights?
And what do I have to hold
When no one's there to hold me tight
And what do I see?
The only thing that gets me through this
Is what I feel
And I feel you

And this ain't no bed of nails
But they're not roses just the same
God this road sure can be long
Another endless day
Another seven hundred miles
That'll take me further from my home

Those little things you say
When words mean so much
You never back down
And they all shy away
You always listen to me

And what do I get
To get me through the sleepless nights?
And what do I have to hold
When no one's there to hold me tight
And what do I see?
The only thing that gets me through this
Is what I feel
And I feel you

I know what you're going through now
Believe me I feel this

And what do I get
To get me through the sleepless nights?
And what do I have to hold
When no one's there to hold me tight
And what do I see?
The only thing that gets me through this
Is what I feel
And I feel you
