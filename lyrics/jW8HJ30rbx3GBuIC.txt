I can never forget you
The way you rock the girls
They rule the world and love you
A blast in the underworld

I stick a knife in my head
Thinkin' about your eyes
But now that you've been shot dead
I've got a new surprise

I've been waiting for you just to say
He's off to check his mind
But all I know is you got no money
But that's got nothing to do with a good time

Can you forgive the boy who shot you in the head?
Or should you get a gun and go and get revenge?
100% of my love up to you, true star
It's hard to believe you took off
I always thought you'd go far

I've been around the world a million times
And all you men are slime
A gun to my head, goodbye, I am dead
Wastewood rockers, it's time for crime, hey!
