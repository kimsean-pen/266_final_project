Even if we're wrong
Girls are always right
Even if we lie
Girls are always...

What you gonna say, What you gonna say, say
When I tell you that I know you lie
What you gonna do, What you gonna do, do
When I'm packing my things tonight
Without you, I'm better off
Cause your kiss was just bad luck
Shoulda known from the start
You were best at breaking hearts

What, what you tryna fight
Get this straight tonight
Girls are always, girls are always right, yeah
Boy, one day you will cry
And wish for you and I
Girls are always, girls are always right, yeah

Girls are always right
Even if we lie

If you done at messing up again
I'm not gonna give, I'm not gonna give in
Sorry we're not staying friends
Without you, I'm better off
Cause your kiss was just bad luck
Shoulda known from the start
You were best at breaking off

What, what you tryna fight
Get this straight tonight
Girls are always, girls are always right, yeah
Boy, one day you will cry
And wish for you and I
Girls are always, girls are always right, yeah
