Party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party, and party...

I stumble up to the window
Open the curtains to blinding lights
Make-up all over the pillow
What went on? What went on?
What went on last night?

You look so sweet while you're dreamin'
Holding your bottle of Tanqueray
It isn't even the weekend
Baby, that's how I know you're the one for me

I wanna party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party, and party...

'Cause when the sun sets baby
On the avenue
I get that drunk sex feeling
Yea, when I'm with you
So put your arms around me baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do

We got that sweet hot lovin'
Dancing in the dark
Out in the street, we're runnin'
We shut down every bar
So put your arms around me baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do

How we do
That's just how we do
How we do
That's just how we do

Hung over, I think I'm broken
You say the fix is a shot of Jack
I said, "Man, what are you smoking?"
But alright, pour a glass
And we'll throw 'em back

I wanna party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party, and party...

'Cause when the sun sets baby
On the avenue
I get that drunk sex feeling
Yea, when I'm with you
So put your arms around me baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do

We got that sweet hot lovin'
Dancing in the dark
Out in the street, we're runnin'
We shut down every bar
So put your arms around me baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do

How we do
That's just how we do
How we do
That's just how we do
How we do
That's just how we do
How we do
That's just how we do

Party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party, and party...

I wanna party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party, and party...

'Cause when the sun sets baby
On the avenue
I get that drunk sex feeling
Yea, when I'm with you
So put your arms around me baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do

We got that sweet hot lovin'
Dancing in the dark
Out in the street, we're runnin'
We shut down every bar
So put your arms around me baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do

How we do
That's just how we do
How we do
That's just how we do
How we do
That's just how we do
How we do
That's just how we do

And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party, and party...
