Hey!
Everybody try to warn me
You were poison from the start
We had a love just like the movies
Put a spell right on my heart

Hey!
I guess that I was too blind
I was too dumb to see it
I didn't wanna be right
Guess I didn't wanna believe it

I was going too slow
Watching life just pass me by
Hey
And now I'm going nowhere
You're the reason why

It's something like an anchor
That won't let go of me
It's something like an anchor
Now I can barely breathe
I don't wanna go down
If I do I'm gonna drown
It's something like an anchor
I can't I can't

Now we're sitting at this table
With nothing left to say
Say you wanna stay together
But I think it's just too late
Oh
Cause I just wanna be free
I cannot do this forever
No
No this is not me
I deserve something better

I was going too slow
Watching life just pass me by
Hey
And now I'm going nowhere
You're the reason why

It's something like an anchor
That won't let go of me
It's something like an anchor
Now I can barely breathe
I don't wanna go down
If I do I'm gonna drown
It's something like an anchor
I can't I can't

Take these chains off me
I don't wanna go under
Take these chains off me
I don't wanna go under
Take these chains off me
I don't wanna go under
Take these chains off me
No no no no no

It's something like an anchor
That won't let go of me
It's something like an anchor
Now I can barely breathe
I don't wanna go down
If I do I'm gonna drown
It's something like an anchor
I can't I can't
Breathe
