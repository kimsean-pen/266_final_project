My baby got a lot to learn
Come here let mama bring you up to speed
A couple of changes and couple of things
I want to go over
A couple of hours is all I need
So let's get it started

I love the way you're touching all over my body
Kissing and licking upon me
I know you want to beat up but
But I'm sorry That ain't really my thing
If you take your time than we can do whatever
What you think we're in here for?
Baby we got all night so don't rush it
You gonna get the reaction you want

Just take it
Slower
Slower
Slower
Slower
Slower
Don't speed it up boy we can go
Slower
Slower
Slower
Slower
Slower

Baby wait a minute
Your closer to the ending
Together we gonna finish off
You speed racer
Slow down

I love the way you're touching all over my body
Kissing and licking upon me
I know you want to beat up but
But I'm sorry That ain't really my thing
If you take your time than we can do whatever
What you think we're in here for?
Baby we got all night so don't rush it
You gonna get the reaction you want

Just take it

I got a vision of us
And there's a kiss with every touch
If I let you take control
Boy you better make me feel love
You never had nothing like this
Gonna show you a thing or two
And if you ask we can go all night
Speed racer

Kissing and licking upon me

But I'm sorry That ain't really my thing
If you take your time than we can do whatever (Slower)
What you think we're in here for?
Baby we got all night so don't rush it
You gonna get the reaction you want
