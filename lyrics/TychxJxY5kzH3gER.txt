Sedative
Sedative
Was my hero
Oh, it was

What's it really like now
It's been a long, long time since I've stepped outside
To the morning sun now
Would you take me out now?
Take me by the hand now
It's been a long, long time since I've stepped outside
To the morning sun

Sedative
Sedative
Was my hero
And I had a hit

Sedative
It was my hero
And I had a hit on it
What's it really like now

It's been a long, long time since I've stepped outside
To the morning sun now
Would you take me out now?
And I crawl along now
It's been a long, long time since I've stepped outside
To the morning sun
My faith in you

Yes, I got faith in you

What's it really like now
It's been a long, long time since I've stepped outside
To the morning sun now
Would you take me out?
And I crawl along now
It's been a long, long time since I've stepped outside
To the morning sun
My faith in you
Faith in you
My faith in you
