I said, "I left my baby girl a message
Sayin' won't be coming home, I'd rather be alone"
She doesn't fully understand me
That I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she'll give me some time I can be the man she needs
But there's a lot of lust inside of me
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her but I need some time to be alone

But when you love someone, you just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave
She's crying her heart to me, "How could you let this be?"
I just need time to see where I wanna be, where I wanna be

Sweet little dee-do-dee-dee

I don't mean to hurt you, baby, oh no, no
Never did I imagine that you would play a major part
In a decision that's so hard
Do I leave? Do I stay? Do I go?
I think about my life and what matters to me the most
Girl, the love that we share is real
But in time your heart will heal

I'm not saying I'm gone but I
Have to find what life is like without you
But when you love someone, you just don't treat them bad

Oh, how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave
She's crying her heart to me, "How could you let this be?"

I just need time to see where I wanna be, where I wanna be
Sweet little dee-do-dee-dee
I don't mean to hurt you, baby

See when you love someone, you just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave
And she's crying her heart to me, "How could you let this be?"

And I just need time to see where I wanna be
See when you love someone, you just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad ow that I wanna leave
And she's crying her heart to me, "How could you let this be?"
And I just need time to see where I wanna be
See when you love someone, you just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave
And she's crying her heart to me, "How could you let this be?"
And I just need time to see where I wanna be, where I wanna be
I'm sorry, baby
