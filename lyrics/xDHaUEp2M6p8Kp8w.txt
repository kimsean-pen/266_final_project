Down the subway, you looked my way
With your girl gaze
That was the day everything changed
Couldn't stay the same
Now it's Tuesday and I'm thinking
'Bout to tuck in
Telling myself that it's cheating
But it's something else

Even though I'm satisfied
I lead my life within a lie
Holding onto feelings
I'm not used to feeling
'Cause, oh, they make me feel alive

When they tell you that you've got to stay the same
Even though you're not yourself
And you've got somebody else
When they tell you that you've got yourself to blame
Even though it's not your fault
But your heart just wants to know, know

Down the subway, you looked my way
With your girl gaze
That was the day everything changed
Now it's something else

Even though I'm satisfied
I lead my life within a lie
Holding onto feelings
I'm not used to feeling
'Cause, oh, they make me feel alive

So won't you?
So won't you?
So won't you?
Will you be my baby now?
So won't you?

With one look you take me back to everything I used to be
When everyone was seventeen with no ID, no ID
Now I wanna love myself
'Cause nothing else is guaranteed
'Cause inside I'm still the same me with no ID, no ID
Won't you be my cherry now?

Holding onto feelings
I'm not used to feeling
'Cause, oh, they make me feel alive
Oh, even though I'm satisfied
I lead my life within a lie
Holding onto feelings
I'm not used to feeling
'Cause, oh, they make me feel alive

So won't you?
So won't you?
So won't you?
Would you be my baby now?
So won't you?
So won't you?
Won't you be my cherry now?
