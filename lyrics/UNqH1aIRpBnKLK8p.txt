And what are we here to prove
Let's stop being public

Because our lips are like glue
I think I love you
So oooooh
Yeah, I wanna love you
I wanna love you for the night

Don't beat yourself up
It's something that I've done
It's something that we all go through
Let's finish up our drinks
We better make a move
Cause we could carry on til' two

I know what you're thinking
I know that it's not like you
Your heartbeat is so quick
When you say, let's rendezvous
