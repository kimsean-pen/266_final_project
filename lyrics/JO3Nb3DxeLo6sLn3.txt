I'm outta my mind, you're under my skin
Oh baby I like it
I'm in too deep, forgot to swim
Oh baby I like it
And I know you notice it
It's just sexuality, why are we fighting, babe?
I think I'm your kryptonite
Baby, your only vice
Let me inside, you don't have to hide here
'Cause I'm on my way, why don't you just come my way?
Losing all my self control, let my body hear your song
'Cause I'm on my way, well just come my way
Touch me like I know you can
You don't have to understand
I'm out of my soul, with nothing to hold
Can you hear me?
I just need a partner to finish what I started
Can you help me?
And I know you notice it
It's just sexuality, why are we fighting babe?
I think I'm your kryptonite
Baby, your only vice
Let me inside, you don't have to hide here
'Cause I'm on my way, why don't you just come my way?
Losing all my self control, let my body hear your song
'Cause I'm on my way, well just come my way
Touch me like I know you can
You don't have to understand
Oh I know you can, oh I know you can
Oh I know you can, oh I know you can
Oh I know you can, oh I know you can
'Cause I'm on my way (don't you know I like it?)
'Cause I'm on my way (don't you know I like it my way?)
'Cause I'm on my way (don't you know I like it?)
Won't you just come my way
'Cause I'm on my way (don't you know I like it?)
'Cause I'm on my way (don't you know I like it my way?)
What you waiting for?
'Cause I'm on my way, why don't you just come my way?
Losing all my self control, let my body hear your song
'Cause I'm on my way, well just come my way
Touch me like I know you can
You don't have to understand
