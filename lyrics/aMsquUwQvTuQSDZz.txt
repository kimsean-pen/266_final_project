Soon ends our stay here and it's been fun
So tonight I'll raise my glass to us
Cause we've talked so much I think we filled this ashtray twice
And I'm pretty sure we emptied every bottle in the place, so...

Let's walk home
Let's be afraid
Wanna grab you by the arms and kiss you
So hard
Let's do it right
Under the streetlight
I want it now
Somehow I forgot how

Way to go, way to go
Forgot you've got so far to go
Way to go, way to go
Forgot you've got so far to go

I heard everybody's voice cut out when you spoke
And I watched all the lights go dim when your eyes opened
Well I can't believe you showed up, what do I do now?
It's last call, time to go, but before we say goodnight

Let's walk home
Let's be afraid
Wanna grab you by the arms and kiss you
So hard
Let's do it right
Under the streetlight
I want it now
Somehow I forgot how

Way to go, way to go
Forgot you've got so far to go
Way to go, way to go
Forgot you've got so far to go
