I felt you in my legs
Before I ever met you
And when I lay beside you
For the first time I told you
I feel you in my heart
And I don't even know you
And now we're saying bye, bye, bye
And now we're saying bye, bye, bye

I was nineteen
Call me

I felt you in my life before I ever thought to
I need to lay down beside you and tell you
I feel you in my heart
And I don't even know you
And now we're saying bye, bye, bye
And now were saying bye, bye, bye

I was nineteen
Call me

I was nineteen
Call me

Flew home
Back to where we met
Stayed inside
I was so upset
I cooked up a plan
So good except
I'm so alone
You were all I had
Love you
You were all mine
Love me
I was yours, right?
I was yours, right?

I was nineteen
Call me

I was nineteen
Call me
