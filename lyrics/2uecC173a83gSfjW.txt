It's been a few years now
And girl, I'm sleeping better than I ever have
Have I let you down? It's harder now
You just gotta tell me when you miss me
'Cause I'm barely around

Does she mind at all? Does she get it?
On the walk to school, just forget it
'Cause I'll be back when you get home

Tell me, is it worth it for you?
See, I'm not being selfish
And is it working for you?
It's okay, I can take it
I need you to say it
So I don't overthink it
She's too young to show it
I need her to understand it

So we're married now
And girl, I'm feeling better than I ever have
Don't wanna let you down 'cause I'm growing up
I'm in no rush to slow down
'Cause I don't know how

You know you have me
You know you have
