Please help me 'cause I'm breaking down, this pictures frozen and I can't get out
Please help me 'cause I'm breaking down, this pictures frozen and I can't get out of here
Believe me, I'm just as lost as you

an every time I think I've finally made it
I learn I'm farther away than I have ever been before
I see the clock and its ticking away, and the hourglass empty
What the F*** do I have to say

Please help me 'cause I'm breaking down, this pictures frozen and I can't get out
Please help me 'cause I'm breaking down, this pictures frozen and I can't get out of here
Release me, I'm just as lost as you
Believe me, I'm just as lost as you

Keep it inside, the image portrayed
As if I couldn't stand losing as if I couldn't be saved, no way
A small confession I think I'm starting to lose it
I think I'm drifting away from the people I really need
A small reflection on when we were younger
We had it all figured out 'cause we had everything covered
Now were older its getting harder to see
What this future will hold for us, what the F*** are we going to be?

Please help me 'cause I'm breaking down, this pictures frozen and I can't get out
Please help me 'cause I'm breaking down, this pictures frozen and I can't get out of here
Release me, I'm just as lost as you
Believe me, I'm just as lost as you

So lost, I'm just as lost as you
Oh well what am I going to do
I'm afraid I'm falling farther away (from where I want to be)

Please help me 'cause I'm breaking down, this pictures frozen and I can't get out
Please help me 'cause I'm breaking down, this pictures frozen and I can't get out of here
Release me, I'm just as lost as you
Believe me, I'm just as lost as you
