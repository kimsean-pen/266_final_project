Let me hear you scream!

I'm back and bruised, beat up, but still I take the blows
'Cause all I need is blood and sweat and skin and bones!

I'll take this rage, rattle your cage
Nobody said it's easy!
It's do or die, only the strong survive!
Get ready for the last stand!
Get ready, I'm your hangman!

Let me hear you scream like you want it!
Let me hear you yell like you mean it!
If you're gonna go down
Go loud, go strong!
Go proud, go on!
Go hard or go home!

Let me hear you (Let me hear you)
Let me hear you (Let me hear you)
Let me hear you scream!

I'll pull you up and push you right back in your place!
I'll take you down and wipe that smile right off your face!

I'll watch you break, your mine to take
Don't blink; you just might miss it!
It's all or nothing, nowhere left to run!
Are you ready for the last fight!?
Get ready with the war cry!

Let me hear you scream like you want it!
Let me hear you yell like you mean it!
If you're gonna go down
Go loud, go strong!
Go proud, go on!
Go hard or go home!

Let me hear you (let me hear you)
Let me hear you (let me hear you)
Let me hear you scream!

Let me hear you scream like you want it!
Let me hear you yell like you mean it!
If you're gonna go down
Go loud, go strong!
Go proud, go on!
Go hard or go home!

Let me hear you scream like you want it!
Let me hear you yell like you mean it!
If you're gonna go down
Go loud, go strong!
Go proud, go on!
Go hard or go home!

Let me hear you (let me hear you)
Let me hear you (let me hear you)
Let me hear you scream!
