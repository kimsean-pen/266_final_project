What is it I don't remember
Made my being so much better?
If I could have
Just one pure thought.

What is it I don't remember
Made my being so much better?
If I could have
Just one pure thought.

I won't be on my way,
(there's nothing there)
I won't be on my way,
I won't be on my way, I will help you on your way.

I won't be on my way,
I won't be on my way,
(there's nothing there)
I will help you on your way.
There is nothing more to say

So far as we've seen we've been the mightiest team
To bear arms since Nile Rodgers was denied entry
And although the macarena has entirely been
I believe you will appreciate the rest of this dream
I got so lost and I'm feeling like I'm following thread
I was the child in the forest with the bones and the bread
I was a train at the point where the rail road ends
Trying to roam across sand with only steam in my hands
It was a trip that I wouldn't wanna take again
It is a trip that I thought would never end
It was a trip that I wouldn't wanna take again
It is a trip I that I thought would never end

What is this feeling I can't remember
It made my being so much better
If I could have
Just one pure thought

What is it I don't remember
Made my being so much better
If I could have just one pure thought

What is this feeling I can't remember
Made my being so much better
If I could have
Just one pure thought

I won't be on my way,
I won't be on my way,
I won't be on my way,
I won't be on my way,
I won't be on my way,
I won't be on my way,
I will help you on your way.

I won't be on my way,
I won't be on my way,
(there's nothing there)
I will help you on your way.
I won't be on my way,
I won't be on my way,
(there's nothing there)
I won't be on my way,
There is nothing more to say
