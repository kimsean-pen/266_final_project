Can't you see who I am
I'm invincible

I am the voice in your dreams
So come and follow me
I am the terror unseen
In our society

Like an invincible shield
The force inside us all
Returned
To strike back
'Cause I'm unstoppable

Can't you see who I am
I'm invincible
Like a force that is out of control
It's the key to achieving my goals
Unbreakable
(One more time)
Can't you hear what I say
It's a miracle
Now you're scared that you're losing it all
But this power runs deep in my soul
Invincible
(Invincible!)

I am your dream in disguise
I am your enemy
I am the shadows you fear
The code awakens me

Inject the brutal vaccine
One man against them all
Like the truth never dies
I'm indestructible

Can't you see who I am
I'm invincible
Like a force that is out of control
It's the key to achieving my goals
Unbreakable
(One more time)
Can't you hear what I say
It's a miracle
Now you're scared that you're losing it all
But this power runs deep in my soul
Invincible
(Invincible!)

This power runs deep in my soul
I'm invincible
And I will never give in
Nor leave you behind
A frantic wonder united we're stronger

Can't you see who I am
I'm invincible
Like a force that is out of control
But this power runs deep in my soul
Invincible

Can't you see who I am
I'm invincible
Like a force that is out of control
It's the key to achieving my goals
Unbreakable
(One more time)
Can't you hear what I say
It's a miracle
Now you're scared that you're losing it all
But this power runs deep in my soul
Invincible
