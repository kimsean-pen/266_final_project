Baby who
Was the one that treated you so bad
That you
Felt that you had to do to me what she had done to you
Now you prove
Everything that my friends had told me about you
Was true
Now it's over and we're through

You got your baby
And had things your way
So can you blame me
For walking away?
What did I do to
Be treated so bad (treated so bad)
Now you have lost me
And I was the best thing you'd ever had

Now you think I don't know
What's going on (what's going on)
But I know with you I'd just be wasting my time
I can't keep
Holding on
But I know with you I'd just be wasting my time (cos I know with you I...)

Can't you see
That the things you said and did never had me
Make believe
That you saw something special inside of me
Now you seem
To think that you can't live your life without me
Sorry
Baby you can do without me

You got your baby
And had things your way (harmony)
So can you blame me (harmony)
For walking away? (walking away)
What did I do to
Be treated so bad (so bad)
Now you have lost me
And I was the best thing you'd ever had

Now you think I don't know (I)
What's going on (what's going on)
But I know with you I'd just be wasting my time
(But I know with you, I'd just be wasting my time)
I can't keep (oh no)
Holding on (just holding on)
But I know with you I'd just be wasting my time
(But I know with you I'd just, I can't restore my time)

I don't know (I don't know)
What's going on (what's going on)
But I know with you I'd just be wasting my time
(You I'd just, wasting my time)
I can't keep (oh I do, yeah)
Holding on
But I know with you I'd just be wasting my time
(Cos I know with you I)

Now you know that, I can live without you
You should see that, (it's not all about you (harmony)
This time

You played to many games
Now it times to see that I won't waste my life, no not me

Now you think I don't know
What's going on
But I know with you I'd just be wasting my time
I can't keep
Holding on
But I know with you I'd just be wasting my time

Now you think I don't know (and just think that I)
What's going on (what's going on)
But I know with you I'd just be wasting my time (wasting my time on you, oh yeah)
I can't keep
Holding on
But I know with you I'd just be wasting my time
(But I know with you I'd just, I can't restore my time)

I don't know (I don't know)
What's going on (what's going on)
But I know with you I'd just be wasting my time
(But I know with you I'd just be wasting my time)
I can't keep (oh no)
Holding on
But I know with you I'd just be wasting my time
(Cos I know with you I, I can't restore my time)

I don't know
What's going on
But I know with you I'd just be wasting my time
(I can't restore my time)
I can't keep
Holding on
But I know with you I'd just be wasting my time
(Cos I know with you I)

I don't know
