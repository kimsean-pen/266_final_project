Hello, hello
Sexy pants
Hello, hello, hello
Sexy pants
Where'd you get those pants
Where'd you get those pants
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
I wanna know why it hurts so bad
Hello sexy pants
Did ya know that I like your pants
I'd like to take a walk with you
through the hills of France
and it's easy as 1, 2
It's a 1, 2 dance
You can make a wish come true
in your 1, 2 pants
But down in Congress
all the boys get mad
Hello let's be friends
take a friendly chance
and go all around the world
in a friendly stance
then go to Pyongyang
and shake some hands
Every day
it's such a lovely day
to wake up in the morning
and everywhere
somebody lonely is still feeling blue
At the clothing store
nobody tells you
the whole world is changing
At the grocery store
someone will tell you
what changed is you
Hello sexy lamp
"Oh, that's a sexy lamp."
You can light up the whole darn sky
at 2 a.m.
Way down in Congress
the lights go black
Simon says,
"I can't remember anything
I've been doing or anything I remember."
I don't care
as long as we find out
what we're supposed to do
Hello, Simon Says
let me sign your checks
