I want to sleep if you are awake
Still makin' believe that you aren't at all crazy
And if you don't believe I think you should
You make me so proud

Still you love to think you have always been this way
But you're all wrong

And you only sleep when you've lost cause
Well I still believe that the cause was always me
And if you don't believe I think you should
You make me so proud

Still you love to think you have always been this way
Well I'd love to think you will someday feel the same

And you love to think it will always, always
And you love to think it will always, always

If you still believe it will always be this way
Well you're all wrong
Yes you're
