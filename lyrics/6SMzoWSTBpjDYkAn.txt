Like waves to the shore
Part of the ocean
The stars is high above
Part of the sky

Now I drift to you
I dream of a river
A water so blue
Wish I could live there

Wish you were here

Like the air that I breathe
You'll always be there
The wings that I need
When I wanna fly

Now I drift to you
I dream of a river
A water so blue
Wish I could live there

Wish you were here
