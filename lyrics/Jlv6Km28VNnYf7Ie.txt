PA
I'm
Going back
Going back
To be young again
To find the time
To develop my mind
And because
To really think
To really hear
To really live
To really love
And because
When I was young
I knew that I was right
Then everything moved
I wondered out of sight
PA, PA PA PA PA PA, PA PA PA, PA, PA
PA, PA PA PA PA PA, PA PA PA, PA, PA
PA, PA PA PA PA PA, PA PA PA, PA, PA
I'm going back, going back
To be young again
To find the time to develop my mind
And because
To really think
To really hear
To really live
To really love
And because
When I was young
I knew that I was right
Then everything moved
I wandered out of sight
PA, PA PA PA PA PA, PA PA PA, PA, PA (I'm going back)
PA, PA PA PA PA PA, PA PA PA, PA, PA (I'm going back)
PA, PA PA PA PA PA, PA PA PA, PA, PA (I'm going back)
To be young again
Yeah, I'm going back!
To be young again
I'm going back
I'm going back
To be young again
