Honey I'm afraid and I know you are too
But we both been thorugh what we've both been through
There's no reason not to cross that line
We all need somebody from time to time

And even if your heart can't look my way
Even if our love can't stay together
I'd rather be king for a day, than a fool forever
King for a day, than a fool forever
Yes I would
Yes I would

And if we take that chance
If we make that leap
Love don't come easy and it don't come cheap
I spent all my money down to my last dime
For just one minute of your sweet time

Even if your heart can't look my way
Even if our love can't stay together
I'd rather be king for a day than a fool forver
Rather be king for a day, than a fool forever

You can take my pride for what it's worth
We deserve to feel good even if it hurts

Even if your heart can't look my way
Even if our love can't stay together
I'd rather be king for a day than a fool forever
Rather be king for a day, than a fool forever
Rather be king for a day, than a fool forever
Rather be king for a day, than a fool, than a fool forever
Rather be king for a day
Rather be king
Rather be king for a day, than a fool forever
