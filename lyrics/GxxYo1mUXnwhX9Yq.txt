When you put two and two together
You figure out love's got four letters
I shoulda known that when I met her
But she had to spell it out for me
After all that second guessing
It's been a long hard history lesson
Hell that's a class I got an F in
But now I understand perfectly

She put the her in hurt
She put the why in try
She put the S.O.B. in sober
She put the hang in hangover (hangover)
She put the ex in sex
She put the low in blow
She put a big F.U. in my future
Yeah she's got a way
She's got a way with words
Yeah she's got a way with words

Little words like "I" and "do"
Lying, cheating, screwed
Yeah all the words I thought I knew
They got a brand new meaning now

She put the her in hurt
She put the why in try
She put the S.O.B. in sober
She put the hang in hangover (hangover)
She put the ex in sex
She put the low in blow
She put a big F.U. in my future
Yeah she's got a way
She's got a way with words
(Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Yeah she's got a way with words
(Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh)
She put the her in hurt
