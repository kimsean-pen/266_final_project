From the deepest of waters
To a burning sky
I've been dragged through golden aisles
Of everyday malice

Sometimes a whisper ain't enough
Sometimes it's all you need
Past times will wake your reasons up
A world you've been spared to believe

As it shows I could've been dreaming
Through all of this
I know it never goes
The way you were raised to kneel and perceive

The Words, The Shadows, The Way
You all just left me to be
Bring me fortune as I die

When they call for me
Saying: "Son you're heartless"
I won't believe it
The Ride Majestic

How can it cease when I transcend
All these images lost in the end
A later storm that will take it all
And wash us all away

Never think it'll be over
It moves in circles
Changing shapes and throwing you back
To where it all began

I've earned my right
I've earned my shelter
Now let me move on

Sometimes the strive is all in vain
Sometimes it gets you there

The Skies, The Darkness, The Sea
You all just showed me the way
Bring the fortune i've denied

Carry my message
The sky declined
Marry the fire
If it still hurts bring it forth to those deprived

(When they call for me)

When they call for me
Saying: "Son you're heartless"
I won't believe it
The Ride Majestic

How can it cease when I transcend
All these images lost in the end
A later storm that will take it all
And wash us all away

When they call for me
Saying: "Son you're heartless"
I won't believe it
The Ride Majestic
