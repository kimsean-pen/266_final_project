Human I despise your humanity
Your Blood shall boil!

Apocalyptic Storms from beyond
As the Stars fell to the Earth
I penetrated the Fabric of Reality
Cause I have seen through the Illusions of Light
And I have walked the Fields of Blight
Now the soil are Dying for my step
Witness the Day of Return

Feasting in Chaos, celebrating Death
Wrapped in Shadows I strike from above
The one spawned in Chaos
The Keeper of Ancient Hate

Apocalyptic Storms from beyond
As the Stars fell to the Earth
I penetrated the Fabric of Reality
Cause I have seen through the Illusions of Light
And I have walked the Fields of Blight
Now the soil are Dying for my step
Witness the Day of Return

Mankind - Face your final Death
The eve of Chaos
Mankind - Face the Black Menace
The eve of Satan

Ancient Hate
