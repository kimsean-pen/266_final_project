It was the truth
That fell from these lips
It blinded us
And then the darkness left

I am yours now
Respectfully
I am yours now
Truthfully

It burnt the stain
Left on my mind
Our hearts they beat
A quarter tone apart

I am yours now
Respectfully
Why can't I do it?
You complete me

Our kind is hard, hard to find, to find
And if it will be
It will be with you

I am yours now
Respectfully
I am yours now
Truthfully
