I said goodbye today
I just watched you drive away
And I just stood with mum and waved
I said goodbye today
Wish you were in a better way
But now it's done and I'll move on

I remember when you took the boat out
You took it too far, took it too far
You took it too far took it too far

She came in today
I just looked at my dad's face
He was crying, I knew she was lying when she said:
"You're okay"
You're not okay, no you're not okay, are you?
You're not okay, no you're not okay

I remember when you took the boat out
You took it too far, took it too far
You took it too far took it too far

And I remember when you took the boat out
You took it too far, took it too far
You took it too far took it too far
I remember when you took the boat out
You took it too far, took it too far
You took it too far took it too far
You took it too far, took it too far
You took it too far, took it too far
