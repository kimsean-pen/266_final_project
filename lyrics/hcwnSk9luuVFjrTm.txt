I feel the spiral take me down
The ugly dog that's kicked around
Fill my lungs with the sound, sound, sound
Of my habitual intentions

I hope that every goddamn day
That the Dope Man comes my way
And I don't wanna go too far away
Rather stay in my acid rain

Sinking deeper can't escape this hole
'Cause my soul aches for religious woe
For my habitual ascension

I hope that every goddamn day
That the Dope Man comes my way
And I don't wanna go too far away
Rather stay in my acid rain

I hope that every goddamn day
That the Dope Man comes my way
And I don't wanna go too far away
From my acid rain

(I'm sorry I was hard to love)
(It wasn't you, it was the drugs, the drugs, the drugs)
(I'm sorry I was hard to love)
(It wasn't you, it was the drugs, the drugs, the drugs)
