I was scanning through the skies
And missed the static in your eyes
Something blocking your reception
It's distorting our connection
With the distance amplified
Was it all just synthesized?
And now the silence screams that you are gone
You've tuned me out
I lost your frequency

There's something here that's broken
There's something here with no end
It's paralyzed
It's in your eyes
'Cause I can feel your soul fade
I can feel your heart change
It falls out of phase with mine
while you oscillate inside
Or is it only in my head?

I was scanning through the skies
And missed the static in your eyes
Something blocking your reception
It's distorting our connection
With the distance amplified
Was it all just synthesized?
And now the silence screams that you are gone
You've tuned me out
I lost your frequency

Left inside a half-life
Irradiated insides
These memories
They never leave
I bared my soul for you and all I got was static
My heart was bulletproof till you took off the jacket

I was scanning through the skies
and missed the static in your eyes
Something blocking your reception
It's distorting our connection
With the distance amplified
Was it all just synthesized?
And now the silence screams that you are gone
You've tuned me out
I lost your frequency

Castaway
My cries are blocked by the horizon
Suffocate
I was doing this all for YOU!

I'M IN THE SHALLOWS!
STUCK IN THE GALLOWS!
I TRIED TO SAVE YOU, NOW I'M SWALLOWED!
YOU WANTED WAR!
I AM THE WAR!
I ALONE!

Something blocking your reception
It's distorting our connection
With the distance amplified
Was it all just synthesized?
And now the silence screams that you are gone
You've tuned me out
I lost your frequency
