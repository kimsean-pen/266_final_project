One's own Kingman,
Christ person, Woman God
At battle with a mass astrengent
The bond that blends the weak to the wise

It's a safe assumption
That you'd want to save me now
But I'll never face castration
For your sacred sow is left

Slaughtered

Brainwashed by me
Myself influence I
Bird brained
World saver
A fake god rests dead inside you

It's a safe assumption
That you'd want to save me now
But I'll never face castration
For your sacred sow is left

Slaughtered

System destroyed
Exposed and unployed
The fruit of intention
Cry for their dead, but turning their head
To ignore reality's claw
Knife to your wrist, syringe in your arm
Is your ounce of prevention
Give what you made,
And under your name on your grave, is salvation

A big fucking joke

Slaughter the pig, the self righteous king
For your own restoration
God is in your chest and faith kills what is precious,
For death is unanswered

Slaughtered

Do sin
