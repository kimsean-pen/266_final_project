Lookin' out on the mornin' rain
I used to feel uninspired (Ah-whoo)
And when I knew I had to face another day (Ah-whoo)
Oh it made me feel so tired

Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
But your the key to my peace of mind

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel, like a natural woman (Ah-whoo)

When my soul was in the lost and found (Ah-whoo)
You came along to claim it (Ah-whoo)
And I didn't know just what was wrong with me (Ah-whoo)
Oh 'till your kiss helped me name it

Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm livin' for
'Cause if I make you happy
I don't need to do more

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (Woman)

Oh, baby what you've done to me (What you've done to me)
You make me feel so good inside good inside (Good inside)
And I, I just wanna be (Wanna be)
Close to you
Because you make me feel so alive
Oh what you've done to me, baby baby

Close to you because you make me feel so alive
You make me feel, you make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman, woman
You make me feel, you make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman

You make me feel, oh baby what you do to me
Can make me feel so good inside
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
Oh what you've done, natural woman
