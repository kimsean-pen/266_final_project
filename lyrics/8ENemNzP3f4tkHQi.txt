You better go and wipe out the doubt in your head
Go and tell him you leavin and kick him right out of your bed
I've been keepin' it quiet but now imma tell you the truth
He has always been on it and he never cared about you

In other words
In other words
I'll always be here by your side
And I hope you'll find
Some peace of mind

Cry him out tonight
Cry your heart right out
But he ain't worth it
Deep down you know it
Go say goodbye and pack your bags
And let him know
Cry him out tonight
I'll dry your tears but now it's time you let him go

He's got your love in a box your heart on the floor
I've been watching him do what he does I ain't gonna no more
I bet all a of my dollars I'm burning them up in flames
That he thought he could go and have you play all of his games

In other words
In other words
I'll always be here by your side
You'll be just fine

Cry him out tonight
Cry your heart right out
But he ain't worth it
Deep down you know it
Go say goodbye and pack your bags
And let him know
Cry him out tonight
I'll dry your tears but now it's time you let him go

Go cry him out
Until he's gone and you dried out
You know you better off without
Cryyyyy

Cry him out tonight
But he ain't worth it
Deep down you know it
Go say goodbye and pack your bags
And let him know
Cry him out tonight
I'll dry your tears but now it's time you let him go
