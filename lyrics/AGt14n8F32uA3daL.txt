A summer evening on Les Champs Elyses
A secret rendezvous they planned for days.
A sea of faces in a crowded cafe,
A sound of laughter as the music plays.

Jean-Claude was a student at the University,
Louise-Marie is just a world away.
He recall the night they met was warm with laughter
The words were music as she turned away.

I'll meet you at midnight,
Under the moonlight,
I'll meet you at midnight...
But Jean-Claude, Louise-Marie will never be...

Each cigarette would light a thousand faces,
Each hour that pass seem like a thousand years.
Midnight was turning into empty spaces
The sound of laughter disappeared.

I'll meet you at midnight,
Under the moonlight,
I'll meet you at midnight...
Oh, but Jean-Claude, Louise-Marie will never be...

A summer morning on Les Champs Elyses,
The empty table in the street cafe.
The sunlight melting through an open doorway,
Jean-Claude has left to face another day.

I'll meet you at midnight,
Under the moonlight,
I'll meet you at midnight...

I'll meet you at midnight,
Under the moonlight,
I'll meet you at midnight...
Oh, but Jean-Claude, Louise-Marie will never be ...
