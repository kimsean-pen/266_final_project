Don't, Don't close your heart to how you feel
Dream Don't be afraid the dream's not real
Close your eyes Pretend it's just the two of us again
Make believe This moment's here to stay
Touch - Touch me the way you used to do
I know Tonight could be all I'll have with you
From now on You'll be with someone else instead of me
So tonight Let's build this memory...
and for the last time

Hold me now
Don't cry
Don't say a word
Just hold me now
And I Will know though we're apart
We'll always be together
Forever in love
What do you say when words are not enough

Time - Time will be kind once we're apart
And your tears Tears will have no place in your heart
I wish I - I could say how much I'll miss you, when you're gone
All my love For you will go on and on and

Hold me now
Don't cry
Don't say a word
Just hold me now
And try To understand that I hope at last you've found
What you've been searching for
And though I won't be there anymore
I will always love you

(Hold me now, don't cry...)

Don't say a word
Just hold me now
And I Will know though we're apart
We'll always be together
Forever in love
What do you say when words are not enough
What can I say now My words are not enough
