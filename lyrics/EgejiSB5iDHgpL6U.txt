Call me the hunter
That's my name
Pretty young thing like you
Is my only game
Don't use no love gun
Don't need no kissing
When I get ahold of you honey
Gonna light you up like Christmas
Ain't no use to run, babe
Ain't no use to hide
'Cause I've got you in the sights
Of my
Burning

Call
Me deliverance
That's ahat I offer thee
Gonna do a million little things to you honey
Your life belongs to me
Don't use no love gun
Don't need no kissing
When I get ahold of you honey
Rip you up to pieces
Ain't no use to run, babe
Ain't no use to hide
'Cause I've got you in the grip
Of my
Endless desire

I don't use no love gun
Don't need no kissing
When I get ahold of you honey
Light you up like Christmas
Ain't no use to run, babe
Ain't no use to hide
'Cause I've got you in the sights
Of my
