Lately I've been listening to this mixtape
All day everyday it never gets too late
Looking forward singing nothings gonna stop us now
No regrets and these cassettes are never running down

Fast forward to something like a feeling
Rewind it tastes just like the real thing
You give me something to live for
You give me something to live for
You give me something to live for

Summer sounds are sizzling through my headphones
Feels just like heaven or I'm just too stoned.
Looking forward singing don't you forget about me
When the music melts your heart its gonna set you free

Fast forward to something like a feeling
Rewind it tastes just like the real thing
You give me something to live for
You give me something to live for
You give me something to live for

Looking backwards and then forwards don't know where to begin
Until i hear it pumping on the stereo
Volume up to the top feel the beat of the drum
Until you hear us playing on your radio
Play it loud never doubt until you're hooked on the sound
Maybe you'll hear us flowing on the beach today
Time to play new arcade coming wave after wave
You know you give me something

Fast forward to something like a feeling
Rewind it tastes just like the real thing
You give me something to live for
You give me something to live for
You give me something to live for
