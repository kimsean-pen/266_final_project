This dark winding road
A long path ahead
A sound in the distance of light escaping
Through the haze of a silhouette
A glimpse of reality
Only leading to nothing where no light dwells
I feel hope leaving
I see love fading
What I wanted to be
What I couldn't become
If you could find me, would you even know me?
An empty room, an empty heartbeat.
I have found you in the darkness
I have found you

And... and here you are
To set a brand new path
To show me all that love means

I was lost, lost at the edge of all reason
And I... I didn't know my way,
I'g given up hope

But... but here you are to set a brand new path
To show me all that love means

When I hold you, I need you
I said forever, and I mean forever
When I hold you, I need you
I said forever, and I mean forever

I was lost, lost at the edge of the reason
And I... I didn't know my way
I'd given up hope

But... but here you are to show me a new way
I didn't know love until your name

But... but here you are to set a brand new path
To show me all that love means

When I hold you, I need you
I said forever, and I mean forever
When I hold you, I need you
I said forever, and I mean forever

I was waiting impatiently
But finally this moment has come
To see you, to feel you, this magic from far beyond

Can you see it?
Can you feel it?
Finally you are in my arms

Oh real love
Most real love
I've died to be yours

What was lost
Your heart has found
Most beautiful one
Can you see it?
Can you feel it?
Finally in my arms
Oh real love
Most real love
I've died to be yours

Can you see it?
Can you feel it?
Finally in my arms
Oh real love
Most real love
I've died to be yours
