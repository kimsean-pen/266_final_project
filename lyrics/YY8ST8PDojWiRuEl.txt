I was there when you needed me most
I was there when you wanted me least
I was your father, your son and your holy ghost and priest

Through your failings and success
Through your losses and gains
I didn't see much happiness or pain

I couldn't save your soul
I couldn't even take you home
I couldn't feel at home
Alone

I saw you at your best
I knew you at your worst
I couldn't tell if you were blessed or cursed
There's ding red eye between the black and the white
It's evidently hard to find the night

I couldn't save your soul
I couldn't even take you home
I couldn't play that role
Alone

Now it's too...
Too late for what should've have been said
Long ago

I was there when you needed me most
I was there when you wanted me least
I was your father, your son and your holy ghost and priest

I couldn't save your soul
I couldn't even take you home
I couldn't fill that hole
Alone
