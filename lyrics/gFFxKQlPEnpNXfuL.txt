Long time ago, far and gone
An old man would nap all alone
Lost in a dream of Lenore, evermore
A tapping he heard at the door
Woke him up from the burden he bore
The sound almost seemed like it were...
...was it her

But the light in his eyes showed the ebony
Wings of the dark
And the light in his heart, it was gone like the
Wind kills a spark

Nevermore, nevermore, quoth the raven his
Unyielding lore
Nevermore, nevermore and the old man
Refused to implore

Pondering weary and weak
The old man still lost in his sleep
Cursed on the bird and his lore, from before
Prophet or devil it was
As he saw it, the old man was lost
Wouldn't see his beloved Lenore - nevermore

And the light in his eyes showed the ebony
Wings of the dark
And the light in his heart, it was gone like the
Wind kills a spark

Nevermore, nevermore, quoth the raven his
Unyielding lore
Nevermore, nevermore and the old man
Refused to implore

But the dream, it was gone 'cause the echo
Went on through his core
And it teared him apart
As the raven kept still - nevermore

Nevermore, nevermore, quoth the raven his
Unyielding lore
Nevermore, nevermore and the old man
Refused to implore

But the dream, it was gone 'cause the echo
Went on through his core
And it teared him apart
As the raven kept still - nevermore

Nevermore, nevermore, quoth the raven his
Unyielding lore
Nevermore, nevermore and the old man
Refused to implore

But the dream, it was gone 'cause the echo
Went on through his core
And it teared him apart
As the raven kept still - nevermore
