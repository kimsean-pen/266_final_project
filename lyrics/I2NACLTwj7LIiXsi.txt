Cold is the night, when the skies collapse
And its so real, surreal
Cos it feels like i've been drowning in a dream again again
Deep swallowing the memories that suffocate
Drowning in the waves of a no man's land
Behind then world is falling out of everything
A lone sailor through the deep
The moon is resting grave above the water
A rider of the dark waves
Shadows underneath Fleeting with godspeed
I'm a rider of the Dark waves
Cold is the sea, when the waves collapse
And its so real, surreal
The moon is resting grave above the water
A rider of the dark waves
Shadows underneath
Fleeting with godspeed
I'm a rider of the Dark waves
Rider of the dark waves
Kill me with your light
Rider of the dark waves
Kill me with your light
Rider of the dark waves
Kill me with your light
Rider of the dark waves
Kill me with your light
