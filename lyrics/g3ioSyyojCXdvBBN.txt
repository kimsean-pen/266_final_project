Boy, you get me so high
Buzzin' like a beehive
Just a little kiss, but when it hits my lips
I'm sippin' on sunshine
Boy, you're looking so fly
Hotter than July
I just want to stay forever and a day
Sippin' on sunshine
Down at the beach, you holding my hand
Got an umbrella stuck in the sand
Watching the waves crash into the shore
Baby, I want some more
Hey, what a beautiful day
All I need is a taste
Nothing but a good time
Sippin' on sunshine
Oh, don't got nowhere to go
So we'll go with the flow
Yeah, we're living the life
Sippin' on sunshine
Boy, you're blowing my mind
You got me up on cloud nine
Just a little taste, I wouldn't want to waste
A sip of that sunshine
We can kick it all night
Underneath the moonlight
But when the party ends, we'll do it all again
Sippin' on sunshine
Down at the beach, you holding my hand
Got an umbrella stuck in the sand
Watching the waves crash into the shore
Baby, I want some more
Hey, what a beautiful day
All I need is a taste
Nothing but a good time
Sippin' on sunshine
Oh, don't got nowhere to go
So we'll go with the flow
Yeah, we're living the life
Sippin' on sunshine
Sippin' on sunshine
Sippin' on sunshine
Sippin' on sunshine
Sippin' on sunshine
Hey, what a beautiful day
All I need is a taste (and it tastes so good)
Nothing but a good time (a good time)
Sippin' on sunshine
Oh, don't got nowhere to go (no, we don't)
So we'll go with the flow (hell yeah)
Yeah, we're living the life (the life)
Sippin' on sunshine
All day, all night
Sippin' on sunshine
Yeah, a good time
Everybody's just sipping on sunshine
Whoa whoa whoa
Sippin' on sunshine
