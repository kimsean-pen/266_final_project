There once was a girl in the olden days
grew weary of men with a roving gaze -
'Farewell, fickle lovers; goodbye, goodbye,
for I'm falling in love with the man in the sky.'

The man in the sky, he walks in haste
with three bright buckles around his waist
and a great dog near and a little dog nigh
and a steady gleam in his golden eye.

The girl went out on a windy hill
and cried when the night was dark and still -
'Come down! come down! you man in the sky,
or else I am likely to pine and die.'

The man in the sky didn't stop to talk;
he went right on with his evening walk
and the great dog howled and the little dog whined
and the girl grew cold in the rising wynd.

She took to her bed from the light of the sun,
but when the sun his course had run
she went to her window so high, so high,
and waited and watched Orion go by.

The man in the sky, he walked in haste
with three bright buckles around his waist
and a great dog near and a little dog nigh
and a gleam for her in his golden eye.

One night she stood on her windowsill
and stepped right out on the highest hill
and climbed to the place where the planets are
and jumped from there to the nearest star.

She rocked in Cassiopeia's chair
and waked the dragon and roused the bear
and the great dog howled and the little dog whined
and the girl grew cold in the rising wynd.

She found Orion at last, and then
she found he was just like other men.
When on his shoulder her head she'd lay
his eye was a million miles away.

The great dog howled and the little dog whined
and the girl grew cold in the rising wynd
and the dragon snarled and the lion roared
and the stars flew by in a golden horde.

This tale has a moral brief to tell;
and I won't go on, for you know it well.
Remember the girl in the days gone by
who fell in love with the man in the sky.

She rocked in Cassiopeia's chair
and waked the dragon and roused the bear;
and where they buried her I forget,
but the man in the sky isn't married yet.
