When morning breaks
We hide our eyes and our lungs aching
Nothing strange
It was in our hands from six to ten
It slipped right out again

There'll be no better time
There'll be no better way
There'll be no better day to save me
Save me
Yeah, save me
Yeah, save me

I hope you see like I see, oh, oh
I hope you see what I see, yeah, yeah
I hope you feel like I feel, yeah

And the world don't stop
There is no time for cracking up
Believe me friend
'Cause when freedom comes
I'll be long gone
You know it has to end

There'll be no better time
There'll be no better way
There'll be no better day to save me
Yeah, save me
Yeah, save me
Yeah, save me

I hope you see like I see, yeah, yeah
I hope you feel what I feel, yeah, yeah
Someone to stand beside me
Beside me
Beside me, now is not the time to cry
Beside me
Beside me

Whether you see or whether you don't, beside me
Whether you feel or whether you won't, beside me
Whether you see or whether you don't, beside me
Whether you feel or whether you won't, beside me
Whether you see or whether you won't, beside me

Whether you feel beside me
I hope you see like I see beside me
I hope you feel what I feel beside me

Weeping willow
The pills under my pillow
Weeping willow
The pills under my pillow
Weeping willow
The gun under your pillow
Weeping willow
Weeping willow

I got to learn to leave the pain
Walk through the door and kiss the rain beside me, beside me
I got to learn to leave the pain
Walk through the door and kiss the rain beside me, beside me
