Bitter tears keep me going
Through the years, freely flowing
What have you done
Only a gun could stop these bitter tears

The endless streets I walk along
You made them seem pretty
But now I dream in country songs
And wake in New York City

And the only beauty is
Is the world seen through the tears

Bitter tears keep me going
Through the years, freely flowing
What have you done
Only a gun could stop these bitter tears

I cry because it looks so good
I cry, why not, it's free
And there's nothing more interesting
Than crying constantly

And as I tell everyone
Cryin' all the time is fun

Bitter tears keep me going
Through the years, freely flowing
What have you done
Only a gun could stop these bitter tears
