Satani, Satani, in amus dignita
Satani, Satani, e vade retro sagitta

We came to fight in the army of Christ
Armed with a fist full of steel
Send to inferno the demons allied
Prayer for prayer the deal

We are the storm and the wicked inside
More than a martyr can take
Fire them back to the dark of the night
Pray for this time we awake

And we all
Die, die, die tonight
Sanctified with dynamite
Die, die, dynamite
Halleluja!

We are damned in the night
Sanctified with dynamite
And at midnight we come for your blood
We are cursed and denied
Holy lord of dynamite
And at midnight forever we are
Die, die, dynamite
Born of tornado, we bring you the night
Pray for we all detonate
Heroes in heaven and servants in life
Kill us before it's too late

Like a messiah we end crucified
Into damnation we rode
Torn into pieces of soldiers divine
Ehre sei gott, we explode

And we all
Die, die, die tonight
Sanctified with dynamite
Die, die, dynamite
Halleluja!

We are damned in the night
Sanctified with dynamite
And at midnight we come for your blood
We are cursed and denied
Holy lord of dynamite
And at midnight forever we are

Die, die, dynamite
Die, die, dynamite
Die, die, dynamite
Halleluja!
Die, die, dynamite
Die, die, dynamite
Die, die, dynamite
We are damned in the night
Sanctified with dynamite
And at midnight we come for your blood
We are cursed and denied
Holy lord of dynamite
And at midnight forever we are
Die, die, dynamite
Die, die, dynamite
Die, die, dynamite
