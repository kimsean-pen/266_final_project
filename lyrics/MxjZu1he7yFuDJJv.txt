For take off and for landing
She pulls on her black gloves
In case she needs to throw your burning body through the clouds
Her voice says you're OK
Just stand up
The eyes say something more
Like give up

'Cause I've finally found a way to release you
But I don't need anything you left me

From thirty-nine thousand feet
The heartland is echoed
The green of farms and dead-end streets
Hide its heavy load
A voice says wipe it all away
Start anew
History takes awhile to see through

'Cause I've finally found a way to release you
And I don't need anything you left me
And I've finally found a way to unseat you
And I don't want anything you left me

You keep your resistance in a jar pressed to the pane
Casting on the runway
Its former stain
You in your safe place
Receptive like a blown-out gate
Protected like a cavity beneath the waves

'Cause I've finally found a way to release you
And I don't need anything you left me
And I've finally found a way to unseat you
And I don't want anything you left me
