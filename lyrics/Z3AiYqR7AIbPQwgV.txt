I used to be a sweetheart
I used to be alright
I'd tell myself I love you
But I'm creeping every night
When I met you at the party
And I told you you were pretty
I was honestly just trying to score

But you made me wait a week
Just to kiss you in the cheek
Now it's breaking my heart to break yours

I said I loved you in the summer
But will I love you in the fall
I thought I wasn't like the others
Guess I'm an asshole after all

Come September I'll be gone (gone, gone, gone)
Come September I'll be gone (gone, gone, gone)

I used to be a good guy
I used to be alright
I'd tell myself I loved you
But I'm creeping every night

When I met you at the party
When I told you you were pretty
I was honestly just trying to score

I said I loved you in the summer
But will I love you in the fall
I thought I wasn't like the others
Guess I'm an asshole after all

Come September I'll be gone (gone, gone, gone)
Come September I'll be gone (gone, gone, gone)

I'd be lying if I said it didn't feel bad
I've been trying
But I cant just get the feeling back
When did I become
One of the bad guys?
I said I loved you in the summer
I loved you in the summer
But will I love you in the fall
Lo-love you in the fall
I thought I wasn't like the others
I wasn't like the others
Guess I'm an asshole after all
Come September I'll be gone
