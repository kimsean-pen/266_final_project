While we used long fingernails
To carve epitaphs into the floor
You were scratching freedom from concrete
Living in a world of gamblers and murder victims
I walk these corridors knowing
Of the net beneath your defiance
Has become legend within these walls
And we sit in our cells and hope
You live enough life for the rest of us
Who did not make it out
