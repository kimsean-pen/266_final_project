Wondering what it's like to die
Oh, what am I supposed to do?
Now that I let you inside
And you painted my spirit blue
True colors never dry
Not for you and I
And my love has got it in for you

Found the voice that drag me out of bed
So I know it's gonna be alright
If I don't get uptight
Fear for love would might never happen if we tried
And listen to the light
Cause our love is keeping me alive

It's not something that we're ever gonna understand
I'll keep it together as long as I can
Until the need inside your heart has died
I will try, try, try

Torn apart but together in the dream
Oh, that's how you come to me
And now you're gonna set me free
From this aweful mystery
That's been coloring my life
But love always survives
It's alright
Yeah, it's always right
