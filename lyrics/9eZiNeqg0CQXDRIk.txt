You have changed
I have changed
Just like you
Just like you

For how long
For how long
Must I wait
I know there's something wrong

Your concrete heart isn't beating
And you tried to
Make it come alive

No shadows
Just red lights
Now I'm here to rescue you

Oh I'm still alive
I'm still alive and
I can't apologise, no

Oh I'm still alive
I'm still alive and
I can't apologise, no

So silent
No violence
But inside my head
So loud and clear

You're screaming
You're screaming
Cover up with a smile I've learned to fear

Just sunshine
And blue skies
Is this all we get, for living here?

Come fire
Come fire
Let it burn and love come racing through

Oh I'm still alive
I'm still alive and
I can't apologise, no

Oh I'm still alive
I'm still alive and
I can't apologise, no

I've learn to lose
I've learn to win
Turn my face against the wind

I will move fast
I will move slow
Take me where I have to go

Oh I'm still alive
I'm still alive and
I can't apologise, no

(I'm still alive)

Oh I'm still alive
I'm still alive and
I can't apologise, no

Oh I'm still alive
I'm still alive and
I can't apologise, no

Oh I'm still alive
I'm still alive and
I can't apologise, no
