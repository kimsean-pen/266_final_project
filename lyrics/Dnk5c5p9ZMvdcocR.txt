I'm down I'm out
Had my feet on the ground
But I'm starting to see things different
I'm thinking hard, breathing
From head not heart
But I don't wanna ruin a good thing
Can we lose ourselves in the moment?
Break ourselves into the open
Make ourselves in the heat of the moment
Cos if I cannot stop!
There ain't gonna be no coming back
And each time that you stop
I can only think about running back!
Cos I don't wanna die without knowing what its like to move inside you
That flesh & bone in me, it's fighting everything, but it feels so good!
Back to centre
Gotta stay strong and censored
Cos I made that promise, for so long
Been holding back
Wanna keep this sacrosanct
But we can't keep our hands from moving
Can we lose ourselves in the moment?
Break ourselves in to the open
Make ourselves in the heat of the moment
Cos if I cannot stop!
There ain't gonna be no coming back
And each time that you stop!
I can only think about running back!
Cos I don't wanna die without knowing what its like to touch you there
That flesh & bone in me, it's fighting everything, but it feels so good!
Move my hands to the shoulder
Feel my plans to unfold ya
Take ourselves to the heat of the moment
Cos if I cannot stop!
