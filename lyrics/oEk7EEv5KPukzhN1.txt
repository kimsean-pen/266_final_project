How can I live with myself?
Forgiven what I did, I'm not into this yet
But I don't remember
I know change comes from you

(How can you live with yourself?
Loving me the way you did
You treated it like ghosts)
But I'm scared to remember
What I did to you

Never gonna leave
Never gonna hurt you
Just say "Yes" (Say "Yes")
Never gonna leave
Never gonna hurt you
Just say "Yes" (Say "Yes")

And now I'll take my second chance
And I'll show you what I have to give
You know I never even noticed
How did I know that I was running from this?
And I want what I want
And I'm not giving up
And I know you feel how I have changed for us
I did it

Maybe down the road when we have one little one in our hands
I'm feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling, I'm feeling so [?]
You know I cherish every moment
You know I cherish you

Never gonna leave
Never gonna hurt you
Just say "Yes" (Say "Yes")
Never gonna leave
Never gonna hurt you
Just say "Yes" (Say "Yes")

You know you matter so much to me
All this time you waited for me to show you who I can be
I'm giving this to you
(I see the man I need
I see everything I wanted this to be and)
You know you matter so much to me
I'm giving this to you
