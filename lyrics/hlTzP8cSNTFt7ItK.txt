Word is a gift
Word is a sword
Word is a gun always ready for war
Mistakenly taken
Gracefully faken
A hill of shit is played off as a stack of gold
Filtered through restrictions
Destiled passive perception
My words of wisdom
Go in one ear and out the other

Yet untold, still unheard
A shield built here, against warning and alert
Yet untold, still unheard
A shield built against warning and alert

For consciousness never bothered
For the minds never taught to listen
My words of wisdom
Go in one ear and out the other

For consciousness never bothered
For the minds never taught to listen
My words of wisdom
Go in one ear and out the other

Like cattle chew your grass
Of recreating advertising
Ears are deaf, not customized
To what is meaningful and wise
Sleeping notion lies unconscious
Under absurd lullaby
It's time I wake it up with a bullet of
Words of wisdom in my mind

Yet untold, still unheard
A shield built here, against warning and alert
Yet untold, still unheard
A shield built against warning and alert

For consciousness never bothered (Bothered!)
For the minds never taught to listen (Listen!)
My words of wisdom (Wisdom!)
Go in one ear and out the other (The other!)

For consciousness never bothered (Bothered!)
For the minds never taught to listen (Listen!)
My words of wisdom (Wisdom!)
Go in one ear and out the other (The other!)
