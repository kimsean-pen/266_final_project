I heard this old story before
Where people keep appealing for the metaphors
Don't leave much up to the imagination
So I wanna give this imagery back
No, it just ain't so easy like that
So, I turn the page and read the story again
And again and again

It sure seems the same with a different name

We're breaking and rebuilding
And we're growing
Always guessing
Never knowing
Shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments

We're clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing and confusing
We're trying but where is this all leading
We'll never know
It all happened so much faster than you could say disaster
Wanna take a time lapse and look at it backwards
From the last one

And maybe that's just the answer that we're after

But after all
We're just a bubble in a boiling pot
Just one breath in a chain of thought
The moments just combusting
Feel certain but we'll never, never know
Sure seems the same

Give it a different name
We're begging and we're needing
And we're trying and we're breathing
Never knowing
Shocking but we're nothing

We're just moments

We're clever but we're clueless

We're just human
Amusing and confusing
We're helping, we're building and we're growing
You never know
You never know
Never know
Knock, knock on my door to door
Tell ya that the metaphor is better than yours
And you can either sink or swim
Things are looking pretty grim
If you don't believe in what this one feeding
It's got no feeling
So I read it again and again and again
Sure seems the same
Too many different names
Our hearts are strong, our hands are weak
We'll always be competing never knowing
Shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing, confusing
But the truth is all we got is questions
We'll never know
Never know
Never know
Never know
