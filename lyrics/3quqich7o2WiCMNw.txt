I move like water, I go with the flow
I go back to old school, I go back to Rome
But this is not history, it's the start of the show
Never worry that is the way that I roll

I'm a bad man, what is it, let me say again
You can try copy like a slave to a trend
Nothing they can say and nothing they can do
It's no problem for me but it's a problem for you

You, you, you, but it's a problem for you
You, you, it's no problem for me but it's a problem for you
You, you, you, but it's a problem for you
You, it's no problem for me but it's a problem for you

You, you, you but it's a problem for you
You, it's no problem for me but it's a problem for you
You, you, you

I move like water, I go with the flow
I go back to old school, I go back to Rome
But this is not history, it's the start of the show
Never worry that is the way that I roll

I'm a bad man, what is it let me say again
You can try copy like a slave to a trend
Nothing they can say and nothing they can do
It's no problem for me but it's a problem for you

You, you, you

But it's a problem for you
You, you, it's no problem for me but it's a problem for you
You, you, you, but it's a problem for you
You, it's no problem for me but it's a problem for you
You, you, you but it's a problem for you
You, it's no problem for me but it's a problem for you
It's no problem for me but it's a problem for you
