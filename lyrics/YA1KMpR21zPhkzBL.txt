I'm approaching a breakthrough
I'm happy now
I've been wrapped up in different lies
I've been wrapped up, I've been untied

One more travel, the top of the mountain
Close your eyes, be patient, it's coming

All my dreams have been weighing me down
Like an anchor to my bed
I can live my life instead

I've been writing my thoughts down
To clear my mind
To try and figure out my brain
To confront and set aside my pain

And I've been searching for meaning
In a blood red field of
Wasted dreams and wasted breath
Baby, wasted dreams, that's worse than death, no

One more try for the top of the mountain
Give me one more sigh to the top of the mountain
Baby, roll those eyes to the top of the mountain
Close your eyes, be patient, it's coming

All my dreams have been weighing me down
Like an anchor to my bed
I can live my life instead
Oh, oh, oh
All my dreams have been weighing me down
Like an anchor to my bed
I can live my life instead

I can live my life instead
I can live my life instead
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I've been writing my thoughts down
To clear my mind
To try and figure out my brain
To confront and set aside my pain, and
I'm approaching a breakthrough
I'm happy now
Though, satisfaction comes and goes
While the saddest facts, they cling like shadows

One more try for the top of the mountain
Give me one more sigh to the top of the mountain
Baby, roll those eyes to the top of the mountain
Close your eyes, be patient, it's coming

All my dreams have been weighing me down
Like an anchor to my bed
I can live my life instead
Oh, oh, oh
All my dreams have been weighing me down
Like an anchor to my bed
I can live my life instead

I can live my life instead
I can live my life instead
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I can live my life instead
I can live my life instead
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
