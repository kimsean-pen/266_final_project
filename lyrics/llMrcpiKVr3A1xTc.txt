Years of compression
The years they come and go
It's all subjective
Worn boots and told you so's
Sews despair in to diamond rings
Burning everything as far as the eyes can see

If I can hold you tonight
And keep you so safe armor falls aside
If I can hold, baby, you tonight
I doubt it's going to change what we are inside

I got the message
I heard it loud and clear
Should have expected
So brash and cavalier
Leary from the dancing days
Born in to the world with two left feet in the grave

If I can hold you tonight
And keep you so safe armor falls aside
If I can hold, baby, you tonight
I doubt it's going to change what we are inside

If I can hold you tonight
And keep you so safe armor falls aside
If I can hold, baby, you tonight
I doubt it's going to change what we are inside

If I can hold you tonight
And keep you so safe armor falls aside
If I can hold, baby, you tonight
I doubt it's going to change what we are inside
