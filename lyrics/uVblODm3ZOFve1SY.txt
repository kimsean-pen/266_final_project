Well, at work I see you
You don't see me
I bet your boyfriend stepped in before I came
I bet he parted with a kiss
Your tattoo ring switches digits
To middle, to index and back
I look sad in all black
Hurry with the darts
I got to get to the band, man

So come visit my place
We'll sit and talk about the stupid shit that your boyfriend says
'Cause I did love you, and I still do
And how my standard of girls is based completely around you
So come visit my place
We'll sit and talk about the stupid shit that your boyfriend says
'Cause I did love you, and I still do
And how my standard of girls is based completely around you

Oh, you live so far away
His contact just says "babe"
I hate these stupid cliches
I let myself up for a year or three
Ghosts of girlfriends haunted me to irrelevance
Crash to my head like a baseball
So I can concentrate on you
My first ever pitfall

So come visit my place
We'll sit and talk about the stupid shit that your boyfriend says
'Cause I did love you, and I still do
And how my standard of girls is based completely around you
So come visit my place
We'll sit and talk about the stupid shit that your boyfriend says
'Cause I did love you, and I still do
And how my standard of girls is based completely around you

Pour out your heart
Give up, restart
It's with the same guy I'm sure
But at least you might get better
I'm not enough to fill you up
Shay just loves someone who wants to see you smiling, happy
I'm not enough to fill you up
Shay just loves someone we know is just exactly like me

So come visit my place
We'll sit and talk about the stupid shit that your boyfriend says
'Cause I did love you, and I still do
And how my standard of girls is based completely around you
So come visit my place
We'll sit and talk about the stupid shit that your boyfriend says
'Cause I did love you, and I still do
And how my standard of girls is based completely around you
