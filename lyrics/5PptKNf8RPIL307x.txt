The night is warmer now
I want to hold it
let's walk the night again
my mind was occupied, but
I was roving, but
I let it go turn the world away
Everybody's running around
Telling me that I should be more
All last night I wanted was to hold you next to me and not move at all
Everybody's telling me I'm half the man I used to be
But I've only lost what I didn't want
there's a fire outside but I'm warm
And here I'm coasting
Here I'm coasting
And in the pouring light
I want to hold it
Put on my blindfold again
If I never say goodbye don't come and haunt me
Let me go
Turn the world away
Everybody's running around
Telling me that I should be more
All last night I wanted was to hold you next to me and not move at all
Everybody's telling me I'm half the man I used to be
But I've only lost what I didn't
want there's a fire outside but I'm warm
And here I'm coasting
Here I'm coasting
I'm just saying
Maybe I'm no saint
But in your closed arm this crown of thorns
Begins to lose its way
Everybody's running around
Telling me that I should be more
All last night I wanted was to hold you next to me and not move at all
Everybody's telling me I'm half the man I used to be
But I've only lost what I didn't
want there's a fire outside but I'm warm
And here I'm coasting
Here I'm coasting'
And here I'm coasting
I'm giving all I have
I'm giving all I have
Here I'm coasting
I'm giving all I have
Here I'm coasting
I'm giving all I have
Here I'm coasting
