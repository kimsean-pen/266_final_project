They're falling like they're dominos
Please believe it and let that be the reason
Geronimo, Geronimo
They're falling like they're dominos
Sight beat the world and we shall see
Geronimo, Geronimo
They're falling like they're dominos
Please believe it and let that be the reason

They're falling like they're dominos
Sight beat the world and we shall see

Geronimo, Geronimo
These girls are falling dominos
They-they call me dynamo
But I be yelling vámonos
So you 'bout undergo
Daenerys in a Game of Thrones
No, I'm not no common hoe
Slip sliding down a rabbit hole, what?

(And they be slain) I slay these bitches double dutch
(And they be slain) I slay these bitches so wassup
(And they be slain) I slay these bitches double dutch
(And they be slain) I slay these bitches so wassup

Jump! Up and down
Jump! All around
Jump! Up and down
Jump! Now make your bootie bounce
(Bootie bounce)
(Now make your bootie bounce)
(Bootie bounce)
(Now make your bootie bounce)

Eh-eh-eh-eh
Eh-eh-eh-eh
Lalala-lala
Eh-eh-eh-eh
Eh-eh-eh-eh
Lalala-lala

Geronimo, Geronimo
I send 'em to Guantánamo
Or better yet the Alamo
Macaulay Culkin's Home Alone
It's my sickening do-si-do
My undefeated rope-a-dope
From Tokyo to Kokomo
My syncopated rodeo, what?
I got my chaperone
My wherefore art thou Romeo
Tell Juliet to hold da phone
Cause she never gonna get that tootsie roll
It's my turn to chew da bone
To spread my leg like Sharon Stone
To do-dominate like Al Capone
This playground is my battle zone, what?

(And they be slain) I slay these bitches double dutch
(And they be slain) I slay these bitches so wassup
(And they be slain) I slay these bitches double dutch
(And they be slain) I slay these bitches so wassup

Jump! Up and down
Jump! All around
Jump! Up and down
Jump! Now make your bootie bounce
(Bootie bounce)
(Now make your bootie bounce)
(Bootie bounce)
(Now make your bootie bounce)

Pretty little lady boy, pretty as can be
All the boys in the hood, go crazy over me
But I don't care, I don't pay 'em no mind
Cause I got ish to do and I ain't got time

Yes, Mama Ru!
Sight beat the world and we shall see
Tell the man with the money to come here and pay me!
Man, she so wise!
