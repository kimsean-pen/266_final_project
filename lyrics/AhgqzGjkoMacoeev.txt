I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

Missing person, I'm a missing person
I'm gone, that's for certain
If they love me, I might hurt them
So I stay behind the curtains
Missing person, I'm a missing person
I'm gone, that's for certain
You won't find me, stop the searching
I stay lowkey when I'm lurking

I quit life, wasn't working
The whole world full of serpents
If you cross me, then you're cursed man
Cut your face off like a surgeon
Off the grid, gone off detergents
I can't be seen, it's disturbing
I don't go out cause I'm nervous
I won't come back to this world man
I wanna know what love is
I wanna know what it feels like
Wanted to see you in that light
Now I'm too deep in the night
I'm just ash now, I been burning
When it's rain out, then I'm surfing
Know it's late now, but I'm learning
Everything calm on the surface

Missing person, I'm a missing person
I'm gone, that's for certain
If they love me, I might hurt them
So I stay behind the curtains
Missing person, I'm a missing person
I'm gone, that's for certain
You won't find me stop the searching
I stay lowkey when I'm lurking

I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone...
