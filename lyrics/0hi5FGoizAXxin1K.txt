I'm focus now
I'm focus now

You used to touch me, love me, hug me, kiss me
Hold me everyday (hold me everyday)
I never thought that I'd be finding out
That you gave your love away
Now, how that you expect for me to stay
Wake up everyday with this on the brain?
So I'ma save face
And I'ma be on my way
'Cause I...

Now I got my head right
Time to finally say goodbye
To all the lies
And them lonely nights, so focus
Now I made up my mind
You were just a waste of time
But now I'm fine
'Cause I'm focus, you're out of my life
I'm focus now
I'm focus now

I never thought that you will treat me
Like I'm just another girl (just another girl)
I thought I was something to you, something new
It's me and you against the world
But now I see this wasn't nothing real
Just another game trying to play the field
So I'ma let go
And I'ma move out on my own
'Cause I...

Now I got my head right
Time to finally say goodbye
To all the lies
And them lonely nights, so focus
Now I made up my mind
You were just a waste of time
But now I'm fine
'Cause I'm focus, you're out of my life
I'm focus now
I'm focus now

I'm concerned about what nobody else got to say
Don't matter just what you do 'cause they're gonna talk anyway
Just stick with what you do and remember to do it just for you
So don't even waste your time
Keep it out your mind, stay on your grind
I'm focus now
I'm focus now
I'm focus now
I'm focus now

Now I got my head right
Time to finally say goodbye
To all the lies
And them lonely nights, so focus
Now I made up my mind
You were just a waste of time
But now I'm fine
'Cause I'm focus, you're out of my life
Now I got my head right (I'm focus now)
Time to finally say goodbye
To all the lies (I'm focus now)
And them lonely nights, so focus
Now I made up my mind (I'm focus now)
You were just a waste of time
But now I'm fine (I'm focus now)
'Cause I'm focus, you're out of my life

I'm focus now
I'm focus now
I'm focus now
I'm focus now
