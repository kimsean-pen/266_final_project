I'll never kneel down
claws are too sharp
let (no) hand hold me down
let no foot mark my ground
the day when pain is flesh

since
that day on
it had, it had begun

the window
hand me the razor
feed me the pain

heee heee heee
the window
oooh uuuh aaah

I'll be bathing in blood flow and I, I call my own
only then I wish I had no, no glory I will fall

seek truth and you will find me
stay close and you will see
speak silence and you will hear me
stay close and you will see

that light will always reign over, over your shadow
you will never die like I die
your fire will always be in me, you will always be
a part of me
the heart of me
