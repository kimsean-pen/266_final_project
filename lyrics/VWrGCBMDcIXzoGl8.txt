Why don't you believe me when I say that I love you?
I'm crazy 'bout you
Wear the face that tells me you think my loving ain't true
I'm all about you
You're my desire
I get higher everytime I speak your name
All I do (that's all I do, that's all I do, that's all I do)
The way that I can't sleep at night just proves what I go through
I'm crazy 'bout you

Now the first time that I saw you walking down the street so pretty
Gone with your bad self
Now you say that I don't love you
When it's giving my love pains
It's the hurt and the tension
Girl, it's driving me insane

You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one
You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one
You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one
You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one!

Why don't you believe me when I say that I am true?
I'm crazy 'bout you
I'm here to love and please you
I'll do what you want me to
I'm all about you
Living and hoping, but I'm coping
With these things you put me through
All I do (that's all I do, that's all I do, that's all I do)
The way that I can't sleep at night
Just proves what I go through
I'm crazy 'bout you

Now the first time that I saw you walking down the street so pretty
Gone with your bad self
Now you say that I don't love you
When it's giving my love pains
It's the hurt and the tension
Girl, it's driving me insane

You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one
You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one
You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one
You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one!
