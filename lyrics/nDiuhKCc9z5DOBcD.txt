It's so fake, this world of ours.
More satellites than shooting stars; they're all around.
Yeah, their broken hearts on the boulevard,
You know this world will leave you scarred and let you down.

By leaving here with you, one of you will be living on the dark side.
Yeah, right here, right now, we'll leave this crowded room.

I'll take your body to the moon.
Then I'll let you turn it around.
Girl, let's show me something new.
Let me watch you take it off now.
Baby we don't need these lights,
'cause you'll be seeing stars tonight.
I'll take your body to the moon.
Let's fly.
Let's fly.

Let's not complicate the night.
Just look up, everything is black and white.
If the universe is you and I, then I know everything is gonna be alright.

So tell me, what do you have to lose? Don't you let this moment pass you by.
Yeah, right here, right now, we'll leave this crowded room.

I'll take your body to the moon.
Then I'll let you turn it around.
Girl, let's show me something new.
Let me watch you take it off now.
Baby we don't need these lights,
'cause you'll be seeing stars tonight.
I'll take your body to the moon.
Let's fly.
