I'll be riding it
I'll be riding it

Wanna make some music
To take me in and out of my head
Get into my groove
In time with my body instead

And when the bass kicks in
I can feel my song beginning
Boy your lovin' gets me high
'Cause you're the only one
Who can pump it loud the way I like

You're a DJ I'm a song
Take me out and turn me on
Let yourself go

Ah you're riding it

Chicas bumping to the beat
From the side and underneath
Yeah my body's where this party's at

I'll be riding it

When you're spinning in
I'll be riding it

He's a little rude and nasty
His tempo is an overload
He gets jiggy with it here
But all I wanna do is vogue

And when the bass kicks in
I can dance like no one's watching
It's a funny kind of feeling
'Cause you're the only one
Who can pump it loud the way I like

You're a DJ I'm a song
Take me out and turn me on
Let yourself go

I'll be riding it

Chicas bumping to the beat
From the side and underneath
Yeah my body's where this party's at

I'll be riding it

When you're spinning in
I'll be riding it

When you're spinning in
I'll be riding it

And when the bass kicks in
I can dance like no one's watching
It's a funny kind of feeling
'Cause you're the only one
Who can pump it loud the way I like

You're a DJ I'm a song
Take me out and turn me on
Let yourself go

I'll be riding it

Chicas bumping to the beat
From the side and underneath
Yeah my body's where this party's at

I'll be riding it

You're a DJ I'm a song
Take me out and turn me on

When you're spinning in
I'll be riding it

Chicas bumping to the beat
From the side and underneath
Turn me on

When you're spinning in
I'll be riding it

When you're spinning in
I'll be riding it

When you're spinning in
I'll be riding it

I'll be riding it
