What is this all about
Settle down, please don't yell or shout
The landlord, he lives downstairs
We'll get evicted, please don't be too loud

You say i'm passive aggressive
How can i not be, when your always talking at me
You say i'm unresponsive
And here you are talking over me

You make me wanna throw this shoe right through that concrete wall
Maybe you should pack your things,
If its that dreadful
Then just leave it all

Don't wanna keep on sharing my bed,
With someone that i have to love less, and less
Every time i try to make you smile
You say that i'm being a child
Well i tried my best

Say that i need therapy,
Well my darling so do you
Don't need for you to tell me
What is wrong in all i say or do

Please don't try to throw this shoe right through that concrete wall,
Maybe you should pack your things,
If its that dreadful
Then just leave it all
