(Verse 1)
I must admit I was set trippin', early on
So not my self, boy you had me completely gone
I lost my cool when I found out 'bout you
And how cowardly you move, I'm just glad that now I'm through
I'm so over you

(Chorus)
I am finished cryin over your lyin', over denyin', I am so over you, so over you
Said I'm finished with it, ain't no more hurtin' over here
I done lost my cool for just a minute, but I'm back and I'm doin my thing again
Said I'm finished with it, ain't no more hurtin' over here
And I got my mind right, ain't no more late nights waitin' up on ya

I'm so over you, over you, over you, over you, over you now
I'm so over you, over you, over you, over you, over you now
I'm so over you

(Verse 2)
Now we done been through this same cycle, time and time
Let you back in even when you broke this heart of mine
I've had enough, boy I swear this time I'm done
You can pack up all your stuff, frankly I don't give a f*ck
I'm so over you

(Chorus)
I am finished cryin over your lyin', over denyin', I am so over you, so over you
Said I'm finished with it, ain't no more hurtin' over here
I done lost my cool for just a minute, but I'm back and I'm doin my thing again
Said I'm finished with it, ain't no more hurtin' over here
And I got my mind right, ain't no more late nights waitin' up on ya
I'm so over you, over you, over you, over you, over you now
I'm so over you, over you, over you, over you, over you now

(Bridge)
I got my swagga back again, and no, I'm not tryna be your friend
And no, ain't no hittin' this again
Ain't no late nights waitin' up on ya, cause I'm so over you

Said I'm finished with it, ain't no more hurtin' over here
I done lost my cool for just a minute, but I'm back and I'm doin my thing again
Said I'm finished with it, ain't no more hurtin' over here
And I got my mind right, ain't no more late nights waitin' up on ya

Said I'm finished with it, ain't no more hurtin' over here
I done lost my cool for just a minute, but I'm back and I'm doin my thing again
Said I'm finished with it, ain't no more hurtin' over here
And I got my mind right, ain't no more late nights waitin' up on ya
