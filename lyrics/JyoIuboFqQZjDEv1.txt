Calling Tracy cause I want a ride
Aaa-Aaa-Aaa
Ricky's rolling hard he wants to fly
Aaa-Aaa-Aaa
Good to cruise but I'm too drunk to drive
Aaa-Aaa-Aaa
Too much talking now I want to die
They hate but we don't care
Get jacked when we're not there
She tries to swing her hair
But your my brother
They hate but we don't care
Get jacked when we're not there
She tries to swing her hair
But your my brother
Band of brother
Forget your sisters
Band of brothers
You're my brother
Band of brothers
Leave your mother
Band of brothers
