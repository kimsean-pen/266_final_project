Within the shadows
Outside of self-blame
Nothing can be forsaken
Nothing can be forgiven
Only future strength
To make your soul driven

Find this voice from within
And let the healing begin

Shadow work is coming down
Like a hound that hunts you
And drags you to the ground
Shadow work is reconstruction
Purification

Unwind your life through
There's no crime but your own
Say hello to the idiom
Conquer the puzzle
And change the drain

To satisfy oblivion
And make the pain oblivious
Again

Shadow work is coming down
Like a hound that hunts you
And drags you to the ground
Shadow work is reconstruction
Purification

Unwind your life through shadow work

Shadow work is coming down
Like a hound that hunts you
And drags you to the ground
Shadow work is reconstruction
Purification

Unwind your life through shadow work
