Deep in the night, boundless violence will seethe with the danger
Our laws collide not allowing another contender
When the wine drinks itself, you will burn to a cinder
We're fighting time awaiting the answers

I'll never let them stake you down
Take you down
I'll fight to find a way

Is there a way to turn the mind of a barbaric stranger?
Eternal days awaiting for you to awake, my avenger
A cruel fate now condemns us to burn to a cinder
Are we too late, running on empty?

I'll never let them stake you down
Take you down
I'll fight to find a way out there
It must be hard
I'll never let them break you now
Forsake you now
Keep holding on and

Give me answers to my prayers
We'll never hide, we'll face the glare
You're the light I see to, raise the flame and blaze the fire
Give me answer to my prayers
We'll carry all the weights to bear
Give me sight to see
I know a way is there to keep the flame

I'll never let them stake you down
I'll fight to find a way out there
It must be hard
I'll never let them break you now
Keep holding on and

Give me answers to my prayers
We'll never hide, we'll face the glare
You're the light I see to, raise the flame and blaze the fire
Give me answer to my prayers
We'll carry all the weights to bear
Give me sight to see
I know a way is there to keep the flame

Why can't I bleed with you?
Forever I will be thrown to the wolves
They'll feed on all our dreams
