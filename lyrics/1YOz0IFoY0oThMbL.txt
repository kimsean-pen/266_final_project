My lips are creeping up your neck
You shiver and try to pull back
And forth and back and forth with it
You're a star that's what you said
And I'd do anything for the high
That's what you said
And I'd do anything for the high

Your hands are firm around my waist
They're moving south my saving grace
Patience was wearing oh so thin
A surge of adrenaline

And I'd do anything for the high
And I'd do anything for the high

I never knew
I never cared
I wonder how it came to this
I play it over in my head
You're watching video instead
And we'd do anything for the high
Must you leave now
Why must you leave now
That's what you said
That's what you said
That's what you said
That's what you said
