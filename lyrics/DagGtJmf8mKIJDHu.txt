It was all simple words, playful at best,
So the story starts
Who am I to say that she's missing out on anything worth
effort these days?
She lays in an empty room, unconscious, as the day passes her by.

(That's not all)

Right away, we fell in into each other head first,
Not even the shallow sign could stop it when our souls hit.
Now its up to us to keep this strong

Little did we know that it planted, something that would
tear us apart.

The miles start to hurt,
The days begin to kill,
It's all in your eyes,
It's the smell of your smoke perfume,
Soon love turns to lust, then back to,
Nothing nothing.

My hands fall all over you, not one moment goes to waste,
This room turns to fire,
I wont let go.

Right away, we fell in into each other head first,
Not even the shallow sign could stop it when our souls hit.

It was all simple words playful at best, so the story ends...

I felt the world in you the way you made time change.
You got away with murder.

This is not with just raw emotion,
from the hands of a man,
Soon love turns to lust then back into a killer.
