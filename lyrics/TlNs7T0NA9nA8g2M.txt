Drowning here in summer's cauldron under mats of flower lava
Please don't pull me out, this is how I would want to go
Breathing in the boiling butter, fruit of sweating golden Inca
Please don't heed my shout, I'm relaxing the undertow
When Miss Moon lays down and Sir Sun stands up
Me, I'm found floating round and round
Like a bug in brandy in this big bronze cup
Drowning here in summer's cauldron
Trees are dancing drunk with nectar, grass is waving underwater
Please don't pull me out, this is how I would want to go
Insect bomber Buddhist droning, copper chord of August's organ
Please don't heed my shout, I'm relaxing the undertow
When Miss Moon lays down
(In her hilltop bed)
And Sir Sun stands up
(Raise his regal head)
Me, I'm found floating round and round
Like a bug in brandy in this big bronze cup
Drowning here in summer's cauldron
Drowning here in summer's cauldron
Drowning here in summer's cauldron
Drowning here in summer's cauldron
Drowning here in summer's cauldron
