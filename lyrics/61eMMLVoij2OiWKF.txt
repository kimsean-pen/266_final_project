So this is summer and the gallow gas is running low
But I don't mind, I'm doing things and I'm doing them with you

Well, you know he's gonna want his rent tonight
But we'll have to tell him how to swallow
All the rent this month

So summer stains the sky with inky swirls that bring the thunder low
But I don't mind, I'm doing things and doing them with you

And if you're smart you'll put that book back down
You'll drag me to the floor
Drag me down for more

Drinking wine
Drinking wine in the afternoon
Do-do do-dooo

Drinking wine
Drinking wine in the afternoon
Do-do do-dooo

Tomorrow's Thursday, that's my day of work
That's my day of walking up the merry hill road making up
Some lie about some job applied for

Well, I've been drinking wine
Well, I've been drinking wine in the afternoon
Do-do, do-dooo

Fifty little filters left their filthy buts behind
Left their blackened heads down
In the ashes that's the last before

I pulled apart and placed within the papers
For a drag of five deserves a second life
Deserves a second life

Don't we all, don't we all
Don't we all, don't we all, all

Love drinking wine
Love drinking wine in the afternoon
Do-do do-dooo

Love drinking wine
Love drinking wine in the afternoon
Do-do do-dooo

Bottle of wine, bottle of wine, bottle of wine, bottle of wine
Bottle of wine, bottle of wine, bottle of wine, bottle of wine
Bottle of wine, bottle of wine, bottle of wine, bottle of wine
