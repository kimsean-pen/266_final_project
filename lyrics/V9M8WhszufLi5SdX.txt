I'm hiding inside me
eye sees through my smile
as I shine
for the eyes of another

let him inscribe
what he admires
let him inspire
so many lies
I can provide
any disguise

night folds me beside you
I hide from your eyes
for I know
this illusion is kinder
than what you'll find
inside
if I reveal
my crime

my deception
my invention
my obsession

you may despise
what you may find
hiding behind
all of the lies
let me provide
one more disguise

you won't understand me
I can't let you try
still I dream
of the day you discover

I am the spy
