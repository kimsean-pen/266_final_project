I don't give a damn about you
No nothing can change my mind no way
I'm happy just to let you walk away
Don't think about you at night
I'm happy to be alone it's ok
But that was yesterday and now I'm
Driving in my car
Words wont get me far
When they don't mean shhhhhhhhh aaaaargh!

Calling you at 3am and I'm
Standing here right outside the door
And I don't think that my heart can take much more
Scared of cracking up again I just
Want it to be like it was before
Cos I dont think that my heart can take much more

I don't give a damn what you do
I'm going to get with you
Again
And that's the way this night is gonna end
You say that you need time
How long does it take to see that we
Are more than meant to be

And now you're driving in your car
But you won't get far
Cos your car is sshhhhhhhh aaaargh!

Calling you at 3am and I'm
Standing right outside the door
And I don't think that my heart can take much more
Scared of cracking up again I just
Want it to be like it was before
Cos I dont think that my heart can take much more

Driving in my car
Words wont get me far
When they don't mean shhhhhhhhh aaaaargh!

Calling you at 3am and I'm
Standing right outside the door
And I don't think that my heart can take much more
Scared of cracking up again I just
Want it to be like it was before
Cos I dont think that my heart can take much more*
