Well, you must be a girl with shoes like that
She said: You know me well
I seen you and little steven and Joanna
Round the back of my hotel

Someone said you was asking after me
But I know you best as a blagger
I said: tell me your name is it sweet?
She said: my boy it's dagger oh yeah

Gave me gear thank you dear bring yer sister over here
Let her dance with me just for the hell of it

Well you must be a boy with bones like that
She said you got me wrong
I would've sold them to you
If I could've just have kept the last of my clothes on
Oh yeah

Call me up take me down with you
When you go I could be your regular belle
And I'll dance for little steven and Joanna
Round the back of my hotel oh yeah

I was good she was hot
Stealin everything she got
I was bold she was over the worst of it
Gave me gear thank you dear bring yer sister over here
Let her dance with me just for the hell of it

Chelsea Chelsea I believe that when you're dancing
Slowly sucking your sleeve
The boys get lonely after you leave
It's one for the Dagger and another for the one you believe

Chelsea I believe that when you're dancing
