Bang! Bang! Shoot em' up, destiny
Bang! Bang! Shoot em' up to the moon
Bang! Bang! Shoot em' up one, two, three
One, two, three, four

I wanted to be a spaceman
That's what I wanted to be
But now that I am a spaceman
Nobody cares about me

Hey, Mother Earth
Won't ya bring me back down
Safely to the sea?
But 'round and around and around and around
Is all she ever say to me

I wanted to make a good run
I wanted to go to the moon
I knew that it had to be fun
I told 'em to send me real soon

I wanted to be a spaceman
I wanted to be it so bad
But now that I am a spaceman
I'd rather be back on the pad

Hey, Mother Earth
Won't ya bring me back down
Safely to the sea?
Around and around and around and around
Is just a lot of lunacy
(Yeah, yeah)
'Round and around and around and around and around
(So bring me back down)
'Round and around and around and around and around
Safe on the ground

Hey, Mother Earth
Better bring me back down
Safely to the sea
But 'round and around and around and around
Is all she ever say to me, yeah

You know I wanted to be a spaceman
That's what I wanted to be
But now that I am a spaceman
Nobody cares about me

Say, hey! You, Mother Earth
You better bring me back down
I've taken just as much as I can
But 'round and around and around and around
Is the problem of a spaceman
