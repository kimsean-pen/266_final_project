I got a headache
But I'm glad that I stayed up late
I think I love you
From all the way across the state
I think i know you,
I love the scar across your face
Just let me kiss you
Yeah I believe a kiss
Could make a change
I stayed up drinking
With Kreider singing bout his Hannah dear
But it was you that I was thinking of
As I played banjo in that rickety chair
That beer called Becks it
Reminds me of a haiku
I wrote and it goes: My beverage of choice
Clearly resembles the face
Of powerful love You are the face of
You are the face of
A powerful love

You are the face of
You are the face of
A powerful love

You are the face of
You are the face of
A powerful love

You are the face of
You are the face of
A powerful love

You are the face of
You are the face of
A powerful love

You are the face of
You are the face of
A powerful love

You are the face of
You are the face of
A powerful love

You are the face of
You are the face of
A powerful love

You are the face of
You are the face of
A powerful love
