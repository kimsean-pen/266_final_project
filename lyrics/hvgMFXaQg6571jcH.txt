All the way, babe, on the floor
Rising in to the top of the line
I was there, thinking about the sun
And I was there with the best sometimes

Lookin' out, past the rubble
Pick yourself up right down the line
I love you babe and I'll be there 'till the end
But until then, it's crowded, babe

Lookin' out from somewhere I've been thinking
I was rollin' past the seas
Wonderin' where my friends are goin'
And wonderin' why they didn't take me

Lookin' out of the window of my room
I'm lookin' out where somethin' once ran wild
I'm lookin' down at the window on the floor, babe
I'm lookin' down 'till I die

Comin' down like the fire in my heart
Comin' down like the risin' in the storm
Comin' down with a feelin' I've been burned, babe
It's comin' down like the fire in my heart, babe

Lookin' out at the field like I was fear
Lookin' down at the tables I've turned
Wonderin' about all my friends down in the combat
I was there with the rest sometimes

Lookin' out, past the rubble
Pick yourselves up all down the line
We'll be stranded, but we won't be forgotten
Down here on the travelin' bay

My life is filled with fear
I cannot believe in truth
Ooh, what am I feelin'
I may have been burned, but I can't believe I've been lyin' on the floor again

And all I see is the darkness in your eyes
It's like loosin' ground on the one that I despise
Pick yourself up right down the line
Lose yourself in your mind
