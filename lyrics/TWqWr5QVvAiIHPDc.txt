I'm tryin to figure out what you're thinking now
Your secrets spilling out
Let it out, let it out, oh
I see what isn't there
You know, I'm never scared
I can take it anywhere
Let it out, let it out, oh
Promise me you won't hold back

Oh, go on, disgust me
Tell me the ugly
I want something real
Oh, go on, despise me
Anything but lying
Tell me I'm inside your head
You don't know what to say
I can see it on your face
With smoke there's always flames
Put it out, put it out, oh
I wanna see all your scars
Show me who you really are
Don't fake it anymore
Let it out, let it out oh

Promise me you won't hold back

Oh, go on, disgust me
Tell me the ugly
I want something real
Oh, go on, despise me
Anything but lying
Tell me I'm inside your head

Give it to me
You know I can take it

Give it to me
Don't hold back now

Promise Me
Promise Me
Promise Me
Promise Me
Promise Me
Give it to me

Don't hold back now

Go on, disgust me
Tell me the ugly
I want something real
Oh, go on, despise me
Anything but lying
Tell me I'm inside

Oh, go on, disgust me
Tell me the ugly
I want something real
Oh, go on, despise me
Anything but lying
Tell me I'm inside your head
