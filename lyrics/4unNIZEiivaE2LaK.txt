Smile, you'll steal away my soul
Smile, I'll hide away and cry
My mind's made up
I will shudder to see your eyes
Smile no doubt I'll keep my pride
But It may be hard to find

There's nothing left
Handed down your legacy
But more regret
Painted on with empathy

Smile, don't complicate my time
Smile don't ask me if I'm fine
My world blown down
There is nothing that words can say
Smile, no doubt I'll keep my pride
But it may be hard to find

There's nothing left
Handed down your legacy
But more regret
Painted on with empathy

There's nothing left, there's nothing left

Smile, you'll steal away my soul
Smile, I'll hide away and cry
There's nothing left
Handed down your legacy

Smile, you'll steal away my soul
Smile, I'll hide away and cry
There's nothing left
Handed down your legacy
Smile, no doubt I'll keep my pride
But it may be hard to find

If only you had tried
Going to leave it far behind
It may be hard to find
If only you had tried
Going to leave it far behind
