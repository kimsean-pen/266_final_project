You can't measure love.
It has no start, it has no end.
Ask me what I mean
there's no in between
there's only you and I.
Silver ecstasy
You gave to me.
Wasted so much time
saying goodbye.
Searching for you and I...
No one else
ever loved me like you did.
No one else
ever gave me such a thrill.
No one else
ever loved me like you did.
Oh, oh.

You did.
Oh, oh.
You did.
You and I will always be
together.
You and I will always be
together.
No one else
ever loved me like you did.
No one else
ever gave me such a thrill.
No one else
ever loved me like you did.
Oh, oh.
You did.
Oh, oh.
You did.
