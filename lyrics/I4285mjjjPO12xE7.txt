Wait for my candle
The wax is almost dry
Id' like to show you
Before you say goodbye
Goodbye

Pictures in the rain
They aren't sad at all
We are alone
That doesn't matter at all
Cause I met the man
Who understands
We don't need
Most honesty

Black magic will save us all
Black magic will save us all
You are the kings and the queens of all
Black magic will save us all
Will save us all

We are the magic
Deep inside
Pit of the others
Who speak otherwise
Their lies

Pictures and names
They don't matter at all
We are alone
Doesn't it matter at all
Cause I met the man
Who understands
And he told me
Cause we don't need

Black magic will save us all
Black magic will save us all
You are the kings and the queens of all
Black magic will save us all
Will save us all

Black magic will save us all
Black magic will save us all
Black magic
Black magic
Black magic
