We've got amnesia from the slightest problems
you start shaking
and you start talking

takes more than working now to keep you from falling
'cause work is starting and things are falling
I'm in a real good place
to light out without leaving a trace
you said i was the only one
now i just don't know whats going on

we don't get out
very much
we don't get out
very much
I'm afraid were loosing touch with our balled up little crowd
when we get out and get drunk
and we get high and don't talk
we just walk and walk and walk until we find ourselves alone
but at least we've got each other

it's not so bad if you can't remember
this is just an excuse for something

we have got amnesia from the slightest problems
you start shaking and you start talking

alone where i can't be you
alone where i can't be you
i don't think a lot about you
I've been thinking a lot about you
