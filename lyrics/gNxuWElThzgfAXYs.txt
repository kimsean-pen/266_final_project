There's an S under my clothes
On my chest where nobody else can see
I light up when the doors are closed
I am free, yeah

And I wish I could make my move
I can tell that you're really into me
And I don't got a thing to lose
In my dreams, in my dreamss

I'm a bad-ass jumping off a moving train
I'm a Jane Bond, putting all them guys to shame
I'm a wildcard and I'm gonna steal your game
You better watch out

I'm a fire starter
Make your blood run faster
I melt hearts like water
Yeah yeah oh oh, yeah yeah, oh oh, yeah yeah
I'm a fire starter, I'm a sweet disaster
I melt hearts like water
Yeah yeah oh oh, yeah yeah, oh oh, yeah yeah

I might look all innocent
But the embers are burning inside of me
And I'm ready to take that step
Can't you see, can't you see

I'm a bad-ass jumping off the moving train
I'm a Jane Bond, putting all the guys to shame
I'm a wild card, Imma bout to take my aim
You better watch out, watch out

I'm a fire starter
Make your blood run faster
I melt hearts like water
Yeah yeah oh oh, yeah yeah, oh oh, yeah yeah
I'm a fire starter, I'm a sweet disaster
I melt hearts like water
Yeah yeah oh oh, yeah yeah, oh oh, yeah yeah

I'm so high
I'm burning up, kiss your lips, I'm waking up
There's nothing more to be afraid of

There's an S under my clothes
On my chest where nobody else can see

I'm a fire starter

I melt hearts like water
Yeah yeah oh oh, yeah yeah, oh oh, yeah yeah
