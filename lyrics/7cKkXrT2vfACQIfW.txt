Oh
I can't even look at you
Without the burn
That turns my insides
Black and blue

Wait
Tell me that it isn't true
You were just running
Out of better things to do
Oh-oh

Didn't you know
La-la-la-la-la-la-love is a landmine
Didn't you know
La-la-la-la-la-la-love is a landmine
Didn't you know
Oh
La-la-la-la-la-la-love is a landmine

Oh
The shells of everything we knew
Litter the wasteland
At the end of me and you
Hey
You better pray it isn't true
That there is a landmine
Out there waiting just for you
Oh-oh

Didn't you know
La-la-la-la-la-la-love is a landmine
Didn't you know
La-la-la-la-la-la-love is a landmine
Didn't you know
Yeah
La-la-la-la-la-la-love is a landmine
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

Didn't you know
La-la-la-la-la-la-love is a landmine
Didn't you know
La-la-la-la-la-la-love is a landmine
Didn't you know
Oh
La-la-la-la-la-la-love is a landmine
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
