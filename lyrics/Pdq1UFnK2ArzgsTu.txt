Full moon is rising, the sky is black
I need your call I'm coming back
The road is straight cast, wind's in my eyes
The engine roars between my thighs

From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains I bring you love

Wild mountain thunder, echoes my quest
My body aches but I'll not rest
Quartz light to guide me, till sunrise leads
My passion screams, my heart it bleeds

From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains I bring you love

Then in the distance, I see you stand
On the horizon you raise your hand
In burning rubber, I end my quest
You fall into my arms at last

From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains, I'll bring you love
From desert plains, I'll bring you love
