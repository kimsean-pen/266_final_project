I know a girl from a lonely street
Cold as ice cream, but still as sweet
Dry your eyes, Sunday Girl

Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl
Looks like he's in another world
Run and hide, Sunday Girl

Hurry up, hurry up and wait
I stay away all week and still I wait
I got the blues, please come see
What your lovin' means to me

She can't catch up with the working crowd
The weekend mood and she's feeling proud
Live in dreams, Sunday Girl

Baby, I would like to go out tonight
If I go with you my folks will get uptight
Stay at home, Sunday
(Ooh ooh ooh)

Oh Sunday girl, yes
how do you call your lovin' man
I simply say
Baby, woah babe
My sweet babe
You're the one

Hurry up, hurry up and wait
I stay away all week and still I wait
I got the blues, please come see
What your lovin' means to me

Oh Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up
hurry up, hurry up
please come see what you do to me
I got the blues

Hurry up, hurry up
Please come see what you do to me
