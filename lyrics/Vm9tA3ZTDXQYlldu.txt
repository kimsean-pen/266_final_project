"Fist City" By: Loretta Lynn
You've been makin' your braggs around town
That you've been a lovin' my man
But the man I love
When he picks up trash
He puts it in a garbage can
And that's what you look like to me
And what I see's a pitty
You better close you face and stay outta my way
If you don't wanna go to fist city

If you don't wanna go to fist city
You better detour around my town
'Cause I'll grab a you by the hair a the head
And I'll lift off of the ground
I'm not a sayin' my baby's at saint
'Cause he ain't
And that he won't cat around with a kitty
I'm here to tell you gal to lay off a my man
If you don't want to go to fist city

Come on and tell me what you told my friends
If you think you're brave enough
And I'll show you what a real woman is
Since you think you're hot stuff
You'll bite off more than you can chew
If you get to cute or witty
You better move your feet
If you don't wanna eat
A meal that's called fist city

If you don't wanna go to fist city
You better detour around my town
'Cause I'll grab a you by the hair a the head
And I'll lift off of the ground
I'm not a sayin' my baby's at saint
'Cause he ain't
And that he won't cat around with a kitty
I'm here to tell you gal to lay off a my man
If you don't want to go to fist city

I'm here to tell you gal to lay off of my man
If you don't wanna go to fist city
