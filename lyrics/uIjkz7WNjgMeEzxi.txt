If I can reach the stars
Pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart
So you could see the truth
Then this love I have inside
Everything it seems
But for now I find
It's only you in my dreams
And I can change the world
I will be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world

If I could've be king
Even for a day
I'd take you as my queen
I'd have it no other way
And our love would rule
This kingdom we had made
Till then I'd be a fool
Wishing for the day
That I can change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world
Baby if I could change the world

I could change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world
Baby if I could change the world
Baby if I could change the world
