I bet you thought that I would lay down and die, oh no
Demon fangs spitting in my cup all night long
Wield your tongue at my throne of power, oh no
I never for a second thought that I was dead, oh no
I never for a second let you into my head, oh no

I'll take a bow and I'll show you how to survive
I bet you thought you were the love of my life, oh no
I bet you thought that I would lay down and die, oh no

I bet you thought that I would lose my mind, oh no
I bet you thought that I'd give up tonight, oh no
Bleeding knees, but honey I can still crawl, yeah
I'm going crazy to get out of this hell hole, yeah

I'll take a bow and I'll show you how to survive
I bet you thought you were the love of my life, oh no
I bet you thought that I would lay down and die, oh no

Why can't I get away from your pain, will I baby?
I never get away, get away
I cannot get away from your pain, will I baby?
I never get away, get away

Now take a bow and I'll show you how to survive
I bet you thought you were the love of my life, oh no
I bet you thought that I would lay down and die

Oh no, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
