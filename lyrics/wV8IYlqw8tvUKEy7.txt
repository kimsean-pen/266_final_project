Turn up the radio
Give 'em what they want
Play their favorite song
Make it sensational
Sing it from the heart
Illuminate the dark

You've been holding back for so long
Time to grow up
Come into your own
Aim for the moon, no looking back
Sing it

I'm strong, I am the decider
I am all the reasons, an animal
I am every season
I am legend, all because of you

Do it for both of us
But march to your own drum, because I am old and done
Swear I can feel the rush
Watching you become everything I'm not

You've been holding back for so long
Time to grow up
Come into your own
Aim for the moon, no looking back
Sing it

I'm strong, I am the decider
I am all the reasons, an animal
I am every season
I am legend, all because of you

To condone this great offense, I address the audience
Our grip is strong or impotent
We're wise to hype this up
Call on the creed and prophetic you'd witness this event
The infant's egg is monetized, a privilege heaven sent

I made you this way
You have me to thank

I'm strong, I am the decider
I am all the reasons, an animal
I am every season
I am legend, all because of you

(Under the spell of it, we're wise to hype this up
A new former shell of it, I'm wise to hype this up.)
