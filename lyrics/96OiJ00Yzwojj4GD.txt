When you're near
My heart starts beating faster
The world starts moving slower
And I just freeze

And it's cold, the steam escapes
Through my lips and dissipates
And you breathe it in
We all breathe it in
Your smile it makes me weak
And the red spreads to my cheeks
You make me feel three glasses in

And you say my name
My legs support a little less
My tongue becomes a little mess
My lips are longing to confess
My lungs they catch on every breath
My heart beats harder at the cage inside my chest

And I die, I die a little death
I die, I die a little death

Come and go
A lightning bolt in daytime
The birds into my eyeline
You're all I see
There's no sign of the sun
So the moon moves out in front
She wants to be aligned
We all want to be aligned
And your voice it makes me weak
I'm wasted when you speak
You hit me hard as red wine

And you say my name
My legs support a little less
My tongue becomes a little mess
My lips are longing to confess
My lungs they catch on every breath
My heart beats harder at the cage
Inside my chest

And I die, I die a little death
I die, I die a little death
I die, I die a little death
I die, I die a little death

You say my name
(You said, you said) My balance takes a little rest
(I'd die, I'd die) My conscience hung under duress
(You said, you said) My twitching fingers do their best
(I'd die, I'd die) To keep their wandering selves in check
(You said, you said) My mind it finds a new address
(I'd die, I'd die) This life is cursed, you're heaven blessed
(You said, you said) This human god, this honoured guest
(I'd die, I'd die) Filling up the emptiness
(You said, you said) My legs support a little less
(I'd die, I'd die) My tongue becomes a little mess
(You said, you said) My lips are longing to confess
(I'd die, I'd die) But I'll never tell, you'll never guess
(You said, you said) My lungs they catch on every breath
(I'd die, I'd die) My heart beats harder at the cage
(You said, you said) Inside my chest

And I die, I die a little death
(You say my name)
I die, I die a little death
(You say my name)
I die, I die a little death
(You say my name)
I die, I die a little death
