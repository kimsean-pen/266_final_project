Moment of clarity

You're leading me where I follow
And all my infinity you're real for now
So I keep telling me, you take the weight off my shoulders
You're every missing piece
You're real for now
I let my walls come down tonight
Will let you waste my time
I don't care if it's strong or light

I'm with you for the night
You're taking me, taking me high
You're loving me, you're loving me right

Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my kind
And so for now
Don't want you, don't want you to stop
I promise I won't get enough
Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my kind
Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my, one of my
Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my, one of my
You're standing out from the crowd
Strobe lights on your body
When everyone's fading out, you're real for now

Won't you just take me down
For you I'm the perfect target
I know when the sun comes out
I'm off but now
I let my walls come down tonight
Will let you waste my time
I don't care if it's strong or light

I'm with you for the night
You're taking me, taking me high
You're loving me, you're loving me right
Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my kind
And so for now
Don't want you, don't want you to stop
I promise I won't get enough
Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my kind

Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my, one of my
Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my
I'll be going, till I'm overloading

Even though it's breaking me, breaking me
Tearing me, tearing me
I'll be going, till I'm overloading
Even though it's breaking me, breaking me
I'm with you for the night
You're taking me, taking me high
You're loving me, you're loving me right
Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my, one of my
I'm with you for the night
You're taking me, taking me high

You're loving me, you're loving me right
Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my kind
And so for now
Don't want you, don't want you to stop
I promise I won't get enough
Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my kind
Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my, one of my
Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my
And so for now
Don't want you, don't want you to stop
I promise I won't get enough
Think you're one of my kind, you're one of my kind
