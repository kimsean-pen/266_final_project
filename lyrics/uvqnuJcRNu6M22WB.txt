Sad, drunk, and poorly
Sleeping really late
Sad, drunk, and poorly
Not feeling so great
Wandering lost in a town full of frowns
Sad, drunk, and poorly
Dogs digging up the ground

And I feel the light
In the night and in the day
And I feel the light
When the sky's just mud and gray
And I feel the light
When you tell me, it's okay
'Cause you're so great, and I love you

Tea, tea and coffee
Helps to start the day
Tea, tea and coffee
Shaking all the way
City's alive and, surprise, so am I
Tea, tea and coffee
Get no sleep today

And I feel the light
In the night and in the day
And I feel the light
When the sky's just mud and gray
And I feel the light
When you tell me, it's okay
'Cause you're so great, and I love you
