I understood loneliness
Before I knew what it was
I saw the pills on the table
For your unrequited love
I would be nothing
Without you holding me up
Now I'm strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us

I am the giant (Ooh)
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am the giant (Ooh)
We'll be breaking boulders underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am the giant (Oh)
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am the giant (Oh)

Don't hide your emotions
You can throw down your guard
And feed from the notion we can be who we are
You taught me something, yeah
Freedom is ours
It was you who taught me living is
Togetherness, togetherness, togetherness

I am the giant (Ooh)
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am the giant (Ooh)
We'll be breaking boulders, underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am the giant (Oh)
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am the giant (Oh)

Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh, oh, oh, oh, hey-oh
I'm gonna shake, throw it away in
The dirt under me, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh
I'm gonna shake, throw it away in
The dirt under me, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh
Gonna shake, throw it away in
The dirt, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh
Gonna shake, throw it away in
The dirt, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh
Gonna shake, throw it away in
The dirt, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh
Gonna shake, throw it away in the dirt

(Ooh)
I am, I am, I am (Ooh)
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am the giant (Ooh)
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am the giant (Ooh)
