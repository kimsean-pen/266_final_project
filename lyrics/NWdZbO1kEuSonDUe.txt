Out to the doghouse with you
That's what she said
You've been inside too long now
I must clean the mess
Go in the backyard will you
And practice your tricks
Go take yourself for a walk
You make me sick

You're just a doggy
In a snap you're fetching the bone
And you're barking when she calls

You're hiding behind the fence
You've been disobedient

Your fun and playfulness is so
Very becoming
But she has got you by the reins
And there is no running
Conditioned to salivate at the first

Sound of the bell
And feeding you the remains of
Of yesterday's meal

Can you hear her calling
From within the house?

Why you're just a doggy
In a snap you're fetching the bone
And you're barking when she calls

You're hiding behind the fence
You've been disobedient
Shape up boy!

Oh, your fun and playfulness is so very becoming
But she has got you by the reins and there is no running
Conditioned to salivate at the first sound of the bell
Feeding you the remains of yesterday's meal

Can you hear her calling
From within the house?
If you would stop barking
She might let you out

At last she opens the back gate
You're released, you're now free to roam
You've been waiting for this moment for sometime
And now you must go
Into the fields where there is laughter
There is peace and you're comfortable
Try to hold on now
Before
She calls you home!

Oww!

Oh, you're in the doghouse
'cause you're just a dog
You're in the doghouse
Oh, you're just a dog
You're in the doghouse
'cause you're just a dog
A little doggy
You're just a dog
You're in the doghouse
?
You're in the doghouse
You're just a dog
You're in the doghouse
