I have decided tonight
I'm staying alive
Just kicking and screaming
Alive, I'm staying alive
Blood boiling and streaming

There are things
Far too dark
To comprehend
Sleep on it
One more night
One more night
My sad old friend

Alive
I'm staying alive
Alive
I'm staying alive
Kicking and screaming
Blood boiling and streaming
Staying alive

The worst is over
