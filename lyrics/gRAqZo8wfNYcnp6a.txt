Why don't you calm down
For crying out loud
I'm losing it lately
I'm young and I'm dumb
I'll live and I'll learn
Yeah, what's the hurry now?
What's the hurry now?

Black in the eyes
Back in my mind
So saturated
Going to bed
The girl in my head
Yeah, I really feel it now
Yeah, I really feel it now
What a feeling
Oh, what am I feeling?

I can't ever seem to make up my mind
Now what does that say about me?
Oh, what does that say?
I just wanna be alone sometimes
But I keep going out
I keep going out, oh

Wasting my time
Breaking through ice
Talking to strangers
Fall through the floor
I'm back at your door
Baby I'm bleeding now

What a feeling
Oh, what am I feeling?

I can't ever seem to make up my mind
Now what does that say about me?
Oh, what does that say?
I just wanna be alone sometimes
But I keep going out
I keep going out, oh

You'll never know
You'll never know
You'll never know
You'll never know
What kind of person I'll become
When you're gone, oh

You'll never know
You'll never know
You'll never know
You'll never know
What kind of person I'll become
When you're gone (oh)

Down on my luck
And looking for love
In all the wrong places
Going to bed
The girl in my head
What am I feeling now?
What am I feeling now?

I can't ever seem to make up my mind
Now, what does that say about me?
Oh, what does that say?
I just wanna be alone sometimes
But I keep going out
I keep going out

You'll never know
You'll never know
You'll never know
You'll never know
What kind of person I'll become
When you're gone, oh

You'll never know
You'll never know
You'll never know
You'll never know
What kind of person I'll become
When you're gone, oh
