When all of this is said and done
You will be alone
'Cause I know this won't last forever
Here's a toast to your unknown
Mother of us all
You and I are one together

I know this won't last forever
But I wish this would last forever
I know this won't last forever
But I wish this would last forever

Waking up to your eye
I don't have an answer
And so I think I know you better
Waking up to your eye
And multi-colored sunsets
You're the one who gives me shelter

I know this won't last forever
But I wish this would last forever
I know this won't last forever
But I wish this would last forever

Keeping it calm
Until we all fade away and move on
Keeping it calm
Until we all fade away, you live on
