If I seem a little jittery I can't restrain myself
I'm falling into fancy fragments, can't contain myself
I'm gonna breakdown, I'm gonna breakdown yes
I'm gonna breakdown, I'm gonna breakdown yes

Now I can stand austerity but it gets a little much
when there's all these livid things that you never get to touch
I'm gonna breakdown, I'm gonna breakdown yes
I'm gonna breakdown, I'm gonna breakdown yes

I feel me brain like porridge coming out of me ears
and I was anticipating reverie
I've taken leave of me senses and I'm in arrears
my legs buckle over, I'm living on my knees
I'm gonna breakdown, I'm gonna breakdown yes
I'm gonna breakdown, I'm gonna breakdown yes

Whatever makes me tick it takes away my concentration
sets my hands a-trembling, gives me frustration
I'm gonna breakdown, I'm gonna breakdown yes
I'm gonna breakdown, I'm gonna breakdown yes

So I hear that two is company for me it's plenty trouble
though my double thoughts are clearer now that I am seeing double
I'm gonna breakdown, I'm gonna breakdown yes
I'm gonna breakdown, I'm gonna breakdown yes

Oh mum can I grow out of what's too big for me?
I'll give up that ghost before it gives up me
I wander loaded as a crowd, a nowhere wolf of pain
Living next to nothing, my nevermind remains
I'm gonna breakdown, I'm gonna breakdown yes
I'm gonna breakdown, I'm gonna breakdown yes
