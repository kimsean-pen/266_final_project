You'd better crawl on your knees
The next time you say that you love me
Fall on your knees, coz this time I won't be so kind
Can't you see that this is life and life is killing me?

Is it yours?
Or is it mine?
Our sky fell down tonight
To wash away our pain

Tell me
Over and over and over and over and over again
It never was the time for us
It never was the time to let me in
Show me
Over and over and over and over and over again
It never was the time for us
It never was the time to let me in

You better see how evil you can be
When you see my evil smile
It's the one that you'll remember
When I'm not so kind
Can't you see that this is death
and death is saving me?

I say burn all of your bridges
While you still have control of the flame
I know it's hard, but you...

Tell me
Over and over and over and over and over again
It never was the time for us
It never was the time to let me in
Show me
Over and over and over and over and over again
It never was the time for us
It never was the time to let me in
Hardened to the point
So hard and to the point

Tell me
Over and over and over and over and over again
[(Hardened)] It never was the time for us
[(to the point)] It never was the time to let me in
Show me
Over and over and over and over and over again
[(So hard and)] It never was the time for us
[(to the point)] It never was the time to let me in

Tell me
Over and over and over and over and over again.
It never was the time for us
It never was the time to let me in
