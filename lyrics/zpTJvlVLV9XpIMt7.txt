Hear millions cry
The darkness falls
Echoing the past
Bleed the world dry

Our threatened kingdoms
The world is divided
Trample ourselves
While we claw for the prize

The schemes of men have failed us all
Strife with no end, our actions will betray us

Battles will rage
Violence will flow
Repeating the past
A tragic path once more

Making our mark while leaving our stain
Our legacy of arrogance will wither with the day

Oppression and fear
Our weapons of choice
Always playing God
It's never enough
Our coveted conquests
At such a great cost
More suffering and loss
A glorious epoch
