One, two, three, four!
Almost every day
I see the same face
On broken picture tube
It fits the attitude
If you could see yourself
You put you on a shelf
Your verbal masturbate
Promise to nauseate

Today I'll play the part of non-parent
Not make a hundred rules for you to know about yoursef
Not lie and make you believe what's evil
Is making love and making friends and meeting god, you're own way
The right way

To see
To bleed
Can not be taught
In turn
You're making us
Fucking hostile!
We stand alone

The truth in right and wrong
The boundaries of the law
You seem to miss the point
Arresting for a joint?
You seem to wonder why
Hundreds of people die
You're writing tickets man
My mom got jumped, they ran!

Now I'll play a public servant
To serve and protect by the law and the state
I'd bust the punks that rape steal and murder
And leave you be if you crossed me I'd shake your hand like a man
Not a god

To see
To bleed
Can not be taught
In turn
You're making us
Fucking hostile!
We stand alone

Vince!

Come meet your maker, boy
Some things you can not enjoy
A fucking wives tale
They put it in your head
Then put you in your bed
He's watching say your prayers
Cause god is everywhere

Now I'll play a man learning priesthood
Who's about to take the ultimate test in life
I'd question things because I am human
And call no one my father who's not closer that a stranger
I will not listen

To see
To bleed
Can not be taught
In turn
You're making us
Fucking!
Fucking!
Fucking!
Fucking hostile!
