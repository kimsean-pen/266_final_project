Until the pages of this book are filled with emptiness
I'm still suspended by a thread
Expecting nothing less
I feel my kindred little ways
I know how my story ends

Like me
It's not your gift to choose
I know you're going to lose
Like me
This futile circumstance
You never had a chance, like me

I'm here walking in a city that is red again
I'm here living with the dead again
Knowing why I'm here again

Like me, oh, it's not your gift to choose
I know you're going to lose
Like me
Oh, this futile circumstance
You never had a chance, like me
Like me, like me, like me

I can stay here forever
The hell is, I just can't remember
I see myself with desperation
This silent night of realization

I fall, I fall

Like me, oh, it's not your gift to choose
I know you're going to lose
Like me, oh, this futile circumstance
You never had a chance, like me...
