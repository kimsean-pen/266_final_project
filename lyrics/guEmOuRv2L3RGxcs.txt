Here, far away
One could feel the earth vibrate
Moon, changing shape and shade
As we all do under its gaze
Yellow Moon on the rise
Yellow Moon on the rise
Round we go... where we stop, yeah, no one knows
So tonight, the moon I go
Yellow Moon on the rise
An echo that rings, a bullet unchained
One life, one grave... joins the parade
The sky grows dark, with fallen stars, who'd come so far
A headstone engraved
The colors turn gray
The black and white fades

Yellow Moon on the rise
Yellow Moon on the rise

Yellow Moon on the rise
Yellow Moon on the rise
