You don't know me
Like you knew me
You stopped listening
The moment that I needed you the most

You can't see me
Like you saw me
Truth comes easy
But it's hard for you to pull me from the ground

So I scream
Scream 'cause it hurts
Your every word
Cuts me inside and leaves me worse

There's no way back
And what if there was
You'd still be you
And I'd still need to say goodbye

Maybe you don't
Love me
Like I love you, baby
'Cause the broken in you doesn't make me run

There is beauty
In the dark side
An' I'm not frightened
Without it I could never feel the sun

So I scream
Scream 'cause it hurts
Your every word
Cuts me inside and leaves me worse

There's no way back
And what if there was
You'd still be you
And I'd still need to say goodbye

Nothing will change, no matter what you say
I'm still gonna be the same
The harder we try, the harder that we fight
Can't get it right

So I scream
Scream 'cause it hurts
Your every word
Cuts me inside and leaves me worse

There's no way back
And what if there was
You'd still be you
And I'd still need to say goodbye

Just say goodbye
Say goodbye
