I feel it's right
You you you you
You by my side
No no no no
Don't say goodbye
Like you always do

Leaving, leaving
It's hard to tell you mean it, mean it
Don't tell me I'm dreaming, dreaming
Turn around and leave me, leave me

I'll be deterred
You you you you
You ask me why
Oh oh oh 'Cause
You'll say goodbye
Like you always do
Oh

Leaving, leaving
Its hard to tell you mean it, mean it
Don't tell me I'm dreaming, dreaming
Turn around and leave me, leave me

Leaving, leave-leaving, leave-leave-leaving

Leaving, leaving
It's hard to tell you mean it, mean it
Don't tell me I'm dreaming, dreaming
Turn around and leave me, leave me
