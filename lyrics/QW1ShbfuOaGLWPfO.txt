I can see in your eyes
I can see your
A thousand points of light
It's a wonderful sight

And I could die right now
And I wouldn't mind
I would be alright

Back then I started wondering how and why
It was and what's my aim
To make you mind
'Til the end of time

And as I sailed from the curse of time
We won
And I'll be alright
We'll be alright

I can see in your eyes
I can see your
A thousand points of light
It's a wonderful sight

And I could die right now
And I wouldn't mind
I would be alright
