I spent my time watchin'
The spaces that have grown between us
And I cut my mind, on second best
Or the scars that come with the greenness
And I gave my eyes to the boredom
Still the seabed wouldn't let me in
And I tried my best
To embrace the darkness in which I swim

Now walkin' back, down this mountain
With the strength of a turnin' tide
Oh the wind's so soft, and my skin
Yeah the sun was so hot upon my side
Oh lookin' out, at this happiness
I searched for between the sheets
Oh feelin' blind, and realized
All I was searchin' for was me
Oh oh, all I was searchin' for was me

Oh, yeah
Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set, keep your hair long
Oh my my darlin'
Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set in your ways
Keep your heart strong

I saw a friend of mine the other day
And he told me that my eyes were gleamin'
Oh I said I had been away, and he knew
Oh he knew, the depths I was meanin'
And it felt so good to see his face
All the comfort invested in my soul
Oh to feel the warmth, of a smile
When he said "I'm happy to have you home."
Oh oh, "I'm happy to have you home."

Oh, yeah
Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set, keep you hair long
Oh my my darlin', keep your head up, keep you heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set in your ways
Keep your heart strong

'Cause I'll always remember you the same
Oh eyes like wild flowers, oh with your demons of change

May you find happiness there
May all your hopes all turn out right

Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set, keep you hair long
Oh my my darlin', keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set in your ways
Keep your heart strong

'Cause I'll always remember you the same
Oh eyes like wild flowers, oh with your demons of change
