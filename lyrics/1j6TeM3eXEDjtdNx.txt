If you stay out all night,
that's alright by me.
But if you must kiss those guys,
well you could at least clean your teeth.
I don't mean to put you down,
but you've taken everything that I own.
Don't tell me
you want some more,
cos I'm closed,
yeah I'm closed,
yeah I'm closed,

Who is this laughing boy
who ladders your tights?
Please tell him to cut the noise,
cos it's spoiling my nights.
I just want to get some rest,
and he's talking to his ma on the phone.
Well,
if he's so homesick
he could go home,
could go home,
he could go home.
I don't need this anymore,
and it's written in the stars I must go.
And will I
come back for more?
I don't know,
I don't know.
No, I don't know,
I don't know.
I don't know.
