Hey drifter...
Took a hit of your supply and now I need a fixer
Dragon on my back and I just can't shake his whisper
You're my religion and I praise you like a scripture
Drifter, mister, Hey drifter
Everyone I used to know thinks I'm insane,
In the membrane
My mother told me I should brake ties...
I threw her to the wayside
Fell in love with a papi gangsta Julio,
From El Barrio
Took a trip in his whip now I'm with damo cholo,
From El Barrio
I'm worried about my soul,
but wherever he goes I go
If you never see me again I lost my heart,
En El Barrio
En El Barrio
En El Barrio
Hey pusher...
I'm his right bitch and I love it when he call me crica
And I'll go apeshit if I catch him with another chica
Even bad, on my back, on my front I'm his Mona Lisa
Pusher, mister, Hey Pusher
Everyone I used to know thinks I'm insane
In the membrane
My mother told me I should brake ties...
I threw her to the wayside
Fell in love with a papi gangsta Julio,
From El Barrio
Took a trip in his whip now I'm with damo cholo,
from El Barrio
I'm worried about my soul, but wherever he goes I go
If you never see me again I lost my heart,
En El Barrio
En El Barrio

En El Barrio
