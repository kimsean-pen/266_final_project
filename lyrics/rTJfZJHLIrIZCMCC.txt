Dread, natty dread now
Dreadlock congo bongo I
Natty dreadlock in a babylon
A dreadlock congo bongo I
Children get your culture
and don't stay there and gesture
Oh the battle will be hotter
And you won't get no supper
Natty dread, natty dread now
A dreadlock congo bongo I
Natty dreadlock in a babylon
Roots natty roots natty

Then I walk up the first street
And then I walked up the second street to see
Then I trod on thru third street
And then I talk to some dread on fourth street
Natty dreadlock in a fifth street
And then I skip one fence to sixth street
I've got to reach seventh street
Natty dreadlock congo bongo I
Natty dread, natty dread now
Roots natty congo I

Oh, natty, natty
Natty 21, 000 miles away from home
Oh, natty, natty
And that's a long way
for natty to be from home
Don't care what the world seh
I and I couldn't never go astray
Just like a bright and sunny day
Oh we're gonna have things our way
Natty draed, natty dreadlock
Dreadlock congo, bongo I
Don't care what the world seh
I and I gonna have things our way
If a egg natty in a the red
