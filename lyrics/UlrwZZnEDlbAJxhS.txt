If you show me how
When you are around
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
You
You
You

All of the time I spent
Never dropping hints
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
You
You
You

You stay for too long
You? and rattle on
I don't know what to do,
I don't know what to do
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
You
You
You
