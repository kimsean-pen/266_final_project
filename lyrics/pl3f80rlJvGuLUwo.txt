Raise the guns at every self-made suspicion
Build the bombs
Corrupt policy's decision
That's the sound
Of integrity breaking its back
In a country founded as a thievery act
Raise the guns at every self-made suspicion
Build the bombs
Corrupt policy's decision
Times are dark
With our children spoon-fed ignorance
Inheritance of an anxious trigger finger
Raise the guns at every self-made suspicion
Build the bombs
Corrupt policy's decision

Our leaders preach if we disagree
We're the traitors of society
Homophobia
Racism, sexism
Our systems breed supremacy

Ignition (ignition), inception
Burning is a fuse to destruction
Break the walls of ignorance
To disarm the world for its last chance
Ignition (ignition), inception
Burning is a fuse to destruction
Break the walls of ignorance
To disarm the world for its last chance

Time again for a war
On an enemy that isn't real
Greedy selfish warlords
Feed the agenda, death's the meal

That's the sound
Impending fear crawling up your spine
In a country where nothing is truly made clear

Raise the guns at every self-made suspicion
Build the bombs
Corrupt policy's decision

Our leaders preach if we disagree
We're the traitors of society
Homophobia
Racism, sexism
Our systems breed supremacy
