I can always pick up books
in the search of what I need
but that doesn't help me any
if you're impossible to read
so if you love me, if you love me
come clean

these monsters in my closet
are watching over me
the days are getting shorter
and at night it's hard to sleep
the combination of all of this
is the death of everything
so if you love me, if you love me
hurry

because I don't think that wasting
a second of this time
would benefit the outcome
of the life I had in mind
I'll refer to you as my special love
the one that set me free
so if you love me, if you love me
come clean

waiting around until things grow old
I'm feeling lost in towns that were my home
and if everything was easier before
then we'll go back to who we were

so I'm picking up a book
in the search of what I need
from religion, to fiction
being lost about at sea
and all I can imagine
is being brushed against your cheek
so if you love me, if you love me
come clean
