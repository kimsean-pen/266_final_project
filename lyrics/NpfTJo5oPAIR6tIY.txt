If I lost my eyes, would you stay with me?
Would take me by hand and tell me what you see?
Fill my head with colors for my dreams?

If I had lost my eyes
If I had lost my eyes

If I lost my hands, couldn't feel a thing
If my touch was gone forever out of reach
Couldn't hold you like a woman needs to be

If I had lost my hands
If I had lost my hands

Would you stay?
Would you stay?
Would you stray?

Just run away
Or would you give me something to believe in?
Would you show me the way?
You believe, so I believe

If I lost my mind, would you stay with me?
Remind me of the man I used to be?
Fill my head with hope times infinity?

If I had lost my mind
If I had lost my hands
If I had lost my eyes

Would you stay?
Would you stay?
Would you stay?
