I was born to be just like you
But I'm not like you
Made myself this way
A pillar an unafraid
Don't drop the shade
You down with O-p-p-o-s-i-n-g?
Yeah you know me
Tastefully hating these
Thought police
Unbreakable no release

Hate me hate me
You will never break me
Until my dying day
(My life my way this time)
Save me save me
There's no one that will save me
Until my dying day
(My life my way this time)

Hate me Hate me
I will never be a motherfucker like you
Hate me Hate me
I will never be a motherfucker like you

Now common sense isn't common
Unconscious logic quick to the coffin
Stray from the path footsteps like this
On a soap box but you're all silent
I'm sick of the same story
So boring
If you try to ignore me this is your last warning
I don't fuck with the obvious
Up top while you're all in the audience

Hate me hate me
You will never break me
Until my dying day
(My life my way this time)
Save me save me
There's no one that will save me
Until my dying day
(My life my way this time)

Hate me Hate me
I will never be a motherfucker like you
Hate me Hate me
I will never be a motherfucker like you

I was born to be just like you
But I'm not like you
I was born to be just like you
But I'm not like you

Hate me hate me
You will never break me
Until my dying day
(My life my way this time)
Save me save me
There's no one that will save me
Until my dying day
(My life my way this time)

Hate me Hate me
I will never be a motherfucker like you
Hate me Hate me
I will never be a motherfucker like you

Not like you
I will never be a motherfucker like you
