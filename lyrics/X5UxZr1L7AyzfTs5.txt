I miss the life time's insanity
It's too predictable and organized and all-right.
I'll give my poetry to charity cause I can't afford
I can't afford to smile.

Because we never changed a lot my dear,
In too much space we hide
In both ways I apologise.

I'm on my way to infinity
Take the benefit of all things I learned.
I tie a few knots in my handkerchief
So I recall the things that I've learned.

I rest in peace and write you my dear,
You're gonna be all-right
In both ways I apologize.
Because we never changed the locks my dear,
In too much space we hide
In both ways I apologise.

Ooooh

What once was real become a memory
We have to face that our love comes to an end.
I trully love you when you fell on me
And I try when you gathered with my friends.

I rest in peace and write you my dear,
You're gonna be all-right
In two words: I apologize.
