son you must go back to the life
go pack your bags
take up your scythe
cause this world wasn't meant for us both

who made the night
who made the day
who gave you life
who gave you say
I said this world wasn't meant for us both

who rules the day
who rules the night
go pack your bags
take up your scythe
I said this world wasn't meant for us both
