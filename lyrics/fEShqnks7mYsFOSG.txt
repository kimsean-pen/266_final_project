Nearly ten thirty
I'm rising early
I've got an eye to buy the best
Before the rush
Someone left a baby
In the car part
Never any reason
Don't you listen
One more sob story
Some one is calling
Seen through the window
Calling through mirrors
Don't you listen
Don't interfere
Ignore it and
It will go away
Someone is calling
Don't you listen
Don't you listen
Someone is calling
Don't listen
Someone is calling
Don't you listen
Don't you listen
