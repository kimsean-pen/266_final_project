you wanna tell me one more mile
still my windows are fogging up?
i don't want one more try
my engine's rattling in the dust
guess i'm stuck
all the space that i could want
still drown in what's to come
and where i've been
it all just blends
and i'm too real to pretend
just on the way to you
(you)

on the way to you
on the way to you
on the way
to you
to you
on and on and on

staring down this endless road
and it's getting dark
walking blind
still don't know how i got this far
you were there before
felt a whisper
ran for more
but got turned around

and i can't tell where i've been
it all just blends
just me on this road again
(i'm just)

on the way to you
on the way to you
on the way
to you
to you
on and on and on

i'm alone here with you!
i'm alone
without
i'm just
here

on the way to you
on the way to you
on the way
to you
to you
on and on and on
