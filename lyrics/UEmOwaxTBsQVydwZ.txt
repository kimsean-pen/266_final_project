It's always something small in the beginning
Just the careless words and without thinking
That makes the chain react and there's no taking back (oh oh oh oh)

Soon the drawing starts and make it so colts
To tell you random thing that really hurts most
Too stubborn to stand down, too proud to turn around

Caught in a crescendo, crescendo, crescendo
You know that I love to let go, to let go, to let go
'Cause I'm the only one you can trust, you can trust, you can trust
I can tell you more (oh oh oh oh)

You look me in the eye, I keep on staring
Straight ahead like I'm not even caring
But we both this game is all a masquerade (oh oh oh oh)

And then later on, no one could grab it
We've got the moment still, we can't forget it
Before we know it's stuck turn that emotion down (oh oh oh oh)

Caught in a crescendo, crescendo, crescendo
You know that I love to let go, to let go, to let go
'Cause I'm the only one you can trust, you can trust, you can trust
I can tell you more (oh oh oh oh)

Can we stop and talk it over?
Instead of talking go with our songs
Can we stop and talk it over over over over?

(Bridge x2)
We keep getting louder
We keep getting louder
We keep getting louder
I can stand the noise

Caught in a crescendo, crescendo, crescendo
You know that I love to let go, to let go, to let go
'Cause I'm the only one you can trust, you can trust, you can trust
I can tell you more (oh oh oh oh)

Can we stop and talk it over?
Instead of talking go with our songs
Can we stop and talk it over over over over?
