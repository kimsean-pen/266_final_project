I got some money in my pocket and I wanna go shopping
And go buy me some things I like
I saw some kicks up in the mall that I just gotta be rocking
I love to rock them things I like
I'm no material guy, I just wanna look fly
Cool suits, dope boots, dem the things I like
Cause when I get my gear straight

Them honeys gonna be jocking
I'm free
I just spent all my money
But I rocked that like it don't cost a thing
Free
Burned a hole in my pocket

But I rocked that like it don't cost a thing
Call me a perfectionist
Addicted to immaculate
The hair right, shoes tight
Got to look the dress the part
With nothin' in my pocket
Got a catwalk for a closet
On my last lonely dollar
Lock me up before I hit the store
Wanna be like Midas
But my bank account is minus
Gotta stretch that dollar bill
Stretch that dollar
Need a genie in a bottle
Change a quarter to a hundred
Gotta stretch that dollar bill

Stretch that dollar bill
I'm free
I just spent all my money
But I rocked that like it don't cost a thing
Free
Burned a hole in my pocket

But I rocked that like it don't cost a thing
I wear it once
And I don't pop the tags
The next day I'ma bring it back
I'm at the store
Can't find nothin' cheaper than my credit score
My wallet's anorexic
Can I pay my rent the next month?
I can hear my name
Callin' from stilettos on display
Window shopping's overrated
If I see it, I'ma take it
Gotta stretch that dollar bill
Stretch that dollar
This Vogue is only paper
I can't wear the glossy pages
Gotta stretch that dollar bill

Stretch that dollar bill
I'm free
I just spent all my money
But I rocked that like it don't cost a thing
Free
Burned a hole in my pocket

But I rocked that like it don't cost a thing
Get'cha 5's, get'cha 10's, get'cha 20's out
Get'cha 5's, get'cha 10's, get'cha 20's out
Get'cha 5's, get'cha 10's, get'cha 50's out

Get'cha 5's, get'cha 10's, get'cha 50's out
I need to marry a man from Bel-Air
One rack, two rack
I can feel the aircraft hangar
With my coat hangers
Bankrupt, it don't matter
Girls give the eye 'cause they so mad

I could look fresh in a potato sack
Need a overdraft, I'ma overdraft
If the bank man calls, just tell him...
I'm free
I just spent all my money
But I rocked that like it don't cost a thing
Free
Burned a hole in my pocket
But I rocked that like it don't cost a thing

Get'cha 5's, get'cha 10's, get'cha 20's out (burned a whole in my pocket)
Get'cha 5's, get'cha 10's, get'cha 20's out (I'm free free free free free baby)
Get'cha 5's, get'cha 10's, get'cha 50's out (I'm free, oh oh oh)
Get'cha 5's, get'cha 10's, get'cha 50's out (oh oh)
I'm free free, yeah
I just spent all my money
But I rocked that like it don't
Cost a thing
Oh, it don't cost a thing
Don't cost a thing
Yeah, oh oh oh
Yeah
