Cast away
Never fitting
Out of step to
Forge a better path

Building a model
Building a cult

On our own
To make something of ourselves

Geniune sentiment
Is not in today's fashion
Laughing and laughing
All insider jokes

Gasping and gasping
I'm drowning in shit

This path set clear for me
Through Paris in glass
How could I ignore
How can I supress
When it makes more sense than anybody else

As clear as glass
How could I ignore
How can I supress
When it makes more sense than anybody else

Don't tell me what to do
Don't tell me how to think
Don't tell me anything at all
It's all just noise
