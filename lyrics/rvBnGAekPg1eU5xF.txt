I can't seem to take you anywhere
you ditched your friends in New York Center (?) Square
where the rank and file shoot us dirty looks
hail a taxicab, don't want to walk
the nighttime here is a plastic box
gently amplified in the basement rock
the distant tones from the detainees
friendly girls who pack it full of these

when you're not around, this is our sound

I can't seem to take you anywhere
you ditched your friends in Williamson Square
where the rank and file shoot us dirty looks
hail a taxicab, don't want to walk
the nighttime here is a plastic box
you can amplify the basement rock
the distant tones from the detainees
friendly girls who pack it full of these

when you're not around, this is our sound (this is our sound)

when you're not around, this is our sound (this is our sound)

when you're not around
this is our sound
this is not a song
there is nothing wrong
when the light inside
is not as bright
