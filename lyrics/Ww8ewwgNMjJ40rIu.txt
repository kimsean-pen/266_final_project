You look good in blue.
It matches your skin, your eyes dripping with pain.
Someone like you, getting off on the lies 'cause it dulls your surprise again.
If it's alright with you, I could give you some head

and shoulders to lie on.
You look good in blue.
I know what you mean when you say you've seen the end.
Someone like you, been at it again, you knew what was up in the end.
If it's alright with you, I could give you some head
and shoulders to lie on.
Throw your weight on me baby.
Don't complain on me baby.
Escape in me, next to me.
I'm tired, always tired and I got not place to sleep.
Don't mind dividing down the line.
Can't say that I'm complaining 'cause I got no place to play, yeah.
Don't mind dividing down the line.
You look good in blue.
It matches your skin, your eyes dripping with pain.
If it's alright with you, I could give you some head
and shoulders to lie on.
Yes, I could give you some head
and shoulders to lie on.
