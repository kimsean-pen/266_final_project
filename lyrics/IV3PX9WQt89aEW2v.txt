All my friends they shoulder me
And my poor head of woe
They know I'm good
But I want to be bad

Standing there with the lights down low
And lovers who make love
They see me smiling
But I want to be sad

Would you light me up
Really set me on fire
And be there when I'm burning out

Would you hold my head
'Neath the water tap
And elbow me if I get too loud?

Evil walks the streets by day
'Tween every crack and pave
And by night it cowers and hides
Here it comes that awful sting
When You let someone in
You sit so bare in the lame legged chair

Would you light me up
Really set me on fire
And be there when I'm burning out

Would you hold my head
'Neath the water tap
And elbow me if I get too loud?

I want to live between the lie
And where the truth dies
Everything in its own time

Would you light me up
Really set me on fire
And be there when I'm burning out

Would you hold my head
'Neath the water tap
And elbow me if I get too loud?

Would you light me up
Really set me on fire
And be there when I'm burning out

Would you hold my head
'Neath the water tap
And elbow me if I get too loud?
