the king of the inner dominion
the circle of the lost lovers
those who start the monarchy
melodies of them who gave up the ghost

a new sovereign
son of the first king
after the seizure plague
dressed in serrated armour

sensual descendant
of carnal love
semaphore
of all unearthly souls
married
to the divine war
king of a stellar war

dedicated to his father's vow
swear in power to low
asylum in his world
dazzle his hordes
