I want to be a ghost now that we're strangers
I want to be close when your eyes are wayward
I know I'm not right, but it's so wrong
To be in your sight and know that I'm still gone
I want you the most now that we're strangers

Binds of hex and magic
A sight to blur your open eyes
Blinding love so tragic
Tonight your heart is broken

I want to disappear now that we're strangers
I see you so clear when your eyes are wayward
Now you turn away if I get near
The only time you stay is when I'm not here
I want you the most now that we're strangers

Binds of hex and magic
A sight to blur your open eyes
Blinding love so tragic
Tonight your heart is broken

Supernatural
I'll be the one that you let behind the wall
Supernatural
I'll be the one that will watch as you fall
I would never
I would never close my eyes
I would never
I would never

Binds of hex and magic
A sight to blur your open eyes
Blinding love so tragic
Tonight your heart is broken

Supernatural
I'll be the one that you let behind the wall
Supernatural
I'll be the one that will watch you as you fall
