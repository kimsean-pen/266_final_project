Woman, I can't please you
I'll only leave you
Sure as the night follows day
If you start to wonder
If your spell i'm under
Honey, you should run the other way

Hold on, I'm coming home
You're giving me a bad desire
You're giving me a burning fire, in my bones
And I wanna see you tonight one last time
And go home and turn off the lights
And leave you alone, leave you alone

Woman, i've got nothing
To give you and something else is always on my mind
Little love drug needing
You always make me feel
Like for a minute, nothing here is wrong

So hold on, I'm coming home
You're giving me a bad desire
You're giving me a burning fire in my bones

And I wanna see you tonight one last time
And go home and turn off the lights
And leave you alone, leave you alone

Yeah
Oh oh
Hey

I wanna see you tonight, one last time
I go home, turn of the lights
And leave you alone, leave you alone

Hold on, I'm coming home
You're giving me a bad desire in my bones
Honey hold on, I'm coming home
You're giving me a bad desire
You're giving me a burning fire
Giving me a bad desire
In my bones
So, I wanna see you tonight, one last time
