I remeber all the things she did before.
I remeber all the times she cried.
I remeber all the things you promised her,
And no one heard.
I remeber all the times you lied.
Don't meddle with the heart,
Or meddle with the mind,
Or meddle with the things that are inside.
Don't know what you'll find.
Don't know what she hides.
So don't go messing with the heart,
Or messing with the mind,
Or messing with the things that are inside.
Don't know what you'll find.
Don't know what she hides.
She still remebers like it's yesterday.
She still remebers you so well.
She still remebers all the things you swore.
Forever more.
She still remembers but wont tell.
Cuz she's a mixed up girl,
In a mixed up world.
And you know she don't mean any harm.
So please understand,
If you take her hand
You'll get much more than you bargend for.
Don't meddle with the heart,
Or meddle with the mind,
Or meddle with the things that are inside.
Don't know what you'll find.
Don't know what she hides.
So don't go messing with the heart,
Or messing with the mind,
Or messing with the things that are inside.
Don't know what you'll find.
Don't know what she hides.
Don't meddle with the heart,
Or meddle with the mind,
Or meddle with the things that are inside.
Don't know what you'll find.
Don't know what she hides.
Don't meddle with the heart,
Or meddle with the mind,
Or meddle with the things that are inside.
Don't know what you'll find.
Don't know what she hides.
Don't meddle with the heart,
Or meddle with the mind,
Or meddle with the things that are inside.
Don't know what you'll find.
Don't know what she hides.
So don't go messing with the heart,
Or messing with the mind,
Or messing with the things that are inside.
Don't know what you'll find.
Don't know what she hides.
