Gonna build it up just to burn it down
You're a princess, I'm a fucking clown
Stop the presses 'cause I'm killing time
Won't you be my bloody valentine?

You're just a fucking kid, and no one ever gives you a break
You want a senorita, and now your heart is gonna break

You're angel blue with teenage traces
Angel blue with pretty faces

Stab my heart like a stick in the mud
Cut my chest just to see the blood
Now I'm singing out the alphabet
As the tears are putting about my cigarette

We'll hit the cemetery, so we can see the holiday lights
Waking up the dead, and everything will be alright

You're angel blue with teenage traces
Angel blue with pretty faces

Alright, stuck in the middle of Heaven and Hell
Alright, trying to find my better angels

Stab my heart like a stick in the mud
Cut my chest just to see the blood
Stop the presses 'cause I'm killing time
Won't you be my bloody valentine?

You're just a fucking kid, and no one ever gives you a break
You want a senorita, and now your heart is gonna break

You're angel blue with teenage traces
Angel blue with pretty faces
