Lord, why hast thou forsaken us?
Still hands are gonna talk to us
Looked in your eyes, looked in your eyes
Seagulls laugh and pick the bones
The entity I wrestle to the ground
Looked in the eye, looked in the eye

Chill, chill, chill, chill

Somedays I'm gonna break myself in two
It's like I've forgotten you
Think I'm gonna go to pieces now
But come out fighting

Chill, chill, chill, chill

Think I'm gonna slow my dance to you
Like we already knew
And though I punch I just keep bouncing back
Come out fighting
