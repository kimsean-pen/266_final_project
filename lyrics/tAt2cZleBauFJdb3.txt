When I was young
I felt the need of learning, learning
Love, I was told
Kept the wheel on turning, turning
Still I'm trying to find
Peace of mind inside
Once in your life
You feel the earge of knowing, knowing
And wondering why...

Come on people let us use our sense
Our time is running out
There aint no doubt about
We can make it try to rearange it
If there's a price
We got to toss the dice

Oho, oho WON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT'S RIGHT
Oho, o yeah WON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG
Oho oho WON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT'S RIGHT
Somebody tell me now

Believe in, destiny
Believe in, humanity
Believe in, yeah we'll meet again
Somehow, somewhere, some day

Why tell me why tell me why tell me
Why do I pray
I need to know right now wo-hoo
Why tell me why tell me why tell me
Why do I pray
I hope that freedom soon will come our way

Come on people lend a helping hand
No need to fuzz and fight
We all know where we stand
Help me make it
Try to re-arange it
Name your price and I will toss the dice

Oho, oho WON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT'S RIGHT
Oho, o yeah WON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG
Oho oho WON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT'S RIGHT
Somebody tell me now

Believe in, destiny
Believe in, humanity
Believe in, yeah we'll meet again
Somehow, somewhere, some day

Why tell me why tell me why tell me
Why do I pray
I need to know right now wo-hoo
Why tell me why tell me why tell me
Why do I pray
I hope that freedom soon will come our way
Why tell me why tell me why tell me
Why do I pray
I need a key to help me anyway
Why tell me why tell me why tell me
Why do I pray
Somebody tell me now
Why tell me why tell me why.
