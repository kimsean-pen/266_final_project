I think I'm going back to California
Summer distant and it's so far away
It's so far
It's so far
Far away

I think I'll drift across the ocean now
Clouds look so clear in your eyes
Let me bring all my
Let me bring all my friends

I think I'll fly across the ocean
I can watch the sky turning grey
I think I'm going back
I think I'll go back

I think I hear the whisper of my own best friend
I think I hear the bells ringing in the square
California
California
