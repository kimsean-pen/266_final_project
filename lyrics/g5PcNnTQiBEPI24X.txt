Try the morning rain, it tastes the same
Pulled one over but I stole her fair and square
You must admit
Pierced the morning rain
She can't go if I don't know I'm goin' in
Had a look around, (?) the town
And I refused to quit
Causing quite a stir all over her
Our bed, you must admit
Pierce the morning rain
Others wouldn't stay
I stuck to you, my friend
I won't abide
I'll bet on sky to get me through this life
