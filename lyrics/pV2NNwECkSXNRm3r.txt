Got a cold wind blowin'
through my heart
through my heart
the game is over
you win
i lose

got a cold wind blowin'
through my heart
through my heart
the game is over
you win
i lose

comin' down
on the wrong side
common' down
on the wrong side
of love

i see your smile
on rainy days
spray painted on clouds floatin' by
i can see your smile now
twisting in a cold wind

got a cold wind blowin'
through my heart
through my heart
the game is over
you win
i lose
