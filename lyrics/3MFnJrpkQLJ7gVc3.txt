I was told I had a funny way
Of walking hours during the rain
But my shoes are only pretty
If they're walking towards you

Underneath the tilted overtree
In a nutshell you're to find
You have been there for a while now
So I'll keep that place in mind

All the people on the train are tired
Seemed to have a busy day
Being busy makes you pretty
At least that's what the doctor said

I've been here many times before
Fell from upstairs to the bottom of the door

Being lonely makes you special
But being special makes you lonely, too
Said the girl on the television news
I was wondering, "Is she talking about me?"

Everyone is on their way back home
Everyone is talking on the phone

Being lonely makes you special
But being special makes you lonely too
Said the girl on the television news
I was wondering is she talking about me
Is she talking about me
Is she talking about me...

All of us will go insane
Everybody will just blow up in flames
Said the girl on the television news
I was wondering is she talking about me
Is she talking about me
