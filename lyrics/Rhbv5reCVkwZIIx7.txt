I can't feel your bones but I can see them
And I can't call you up without a reason
I can take a thousand miles
And I can drive for hours to your house in the summer
But I could stay for longer if you wanted me to

Oh oh oh oh oh, I've been up
And oh oh, I don't sleep enough
And oh oh, I know we don't talk as much
But I can hear you still

Oh oh oh oh oh, I've been up
And oh oh, I don't sleep enough
And oh oh, I know we don't talk as much
But I can hear you still

Oh oh oh oh oh, I've been up
And oh oh, I don't sleep enough
And oh oh, I know we don't talk as much
But I can hear your voice on the phone
When you're up all alone in your room
'Cause I am up too
