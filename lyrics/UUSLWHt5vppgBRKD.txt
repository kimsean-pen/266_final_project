Lyin' in my bed, thoughts in my head
Visions of you but I can't get through the night
So pick up the phone, I know you're home
You're playin' with my heart and you know that it just ain't right

It's just a game of love, love, love
And even though it's hard baby
I can never give you up

You're the one I'm dreamin' of
I can't live without your love tonight
And it's you that I adore
You're the one that I live for inside
Of you, I'm dreamin' of you

So I get in the car but I didn't get far
'Cause the radio played every song that I sang with you
Yesterday's gone and it may be true
But you know that I'll never get over you

It's just a game of love, love love
And even though it hurts me, baby
I can never give you up

'Cause you're the one I'm dreamin' of
I can't live without your love tonight
And it's you that I adore
You're the one that I live for inside
Of you, I'm dreaming of you

You, you gave me love
Love gave us hope and strength to carry on
And you, you gave me faith
When I was fallin' down
You would pick me up, my love

You're the one I'm dreamin' of
I can't live without your love tonight
And it's you that I adore
You're the one that I live for inside
Baby, baby, baby, baby

You're the one I'm dreamin' of
I can't live without your love tonight
And it's you that I adore
You're the one that I live for inside
Baby, I'm dreamin' of you
