I peeked through the gate
Found your hiding place
Feather pens scribble down your commands
"Scientific Evocation"

Decomposing wolf fangs --- x 163
Powdery moonlight --- x 2131g
Half a human --- x 1
Bite off your nail, paint a magic circle
Chanting the magic spell
Summon me now

Take my paws, take my paws
Show me wonders of your world
The autumn leaves, the summer breeze
Your shiny hair like mahogany
Teach me, oh teach me
The language that you sing
Lyrr viva tou conquieta
Aeterrno amora

Crumbling gate
Take me back to empty space
Reached out to your gentle hands
Doors closed
Clipped my arm right off

Still you would never give up
Scanning nether for my whereabouts
Howl
Summon me now

Years gone by
No moments wasted
Day and night
No memories faded
Six hundred and seventeen pages
Now've became the basis for all creations

Hold on tight, hold on tight
Let me shield you from the storm
The melting flesh, the burning tears
Make you stronger than ever before
Vive torr amora vrk
The last words that you spoke
Oozing out from your tiny skull
Thousand years' wisdom

Take my paw, take my paw
You're the wonder of my world
The wrinkled face, the silver hair
Your crystal eyes stay a beautiful pair
Teach me, oh teach me
The magic that you preached
I tried to speak, all that came out was
Howl
Lyrr viva tou conquieta
Aeterrno amora
