Bring forth the last battalions
Reinforce the lines
Borders crossed by horde of rivals
Earth trembles as they march
Towards their doom

Bring forth all firepower
Entering the hostile ground
Defenders prepared for the final hour
Guardians of the north
In the trench shaped tomb

The last dawn of the war
Ready, aim, fire
Fight with valour
Never withdraw
Ready, aim, higher

Bring forth the countless soldiers
To surrender is denied
Leave behind no survivors
Arms deploy, seek and destroy

The last dawn of the war
Ready, aim, fire
Fight with valour
Never withdraw
Ready, aim, higher
