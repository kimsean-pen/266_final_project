Well you drove off in the summer rain
I waved to you like a sleeping dream
Told me to stay callous if someone bothered me
"The Eiffel Tower, the marching band
But I'm sure you wouldn't understand"
I just hope you don't stay gone

Don't leave

Don't leave this world to me
Don't leave
Don't leave this world to me
I saw your mother at the department store
She looked innocent like a still-born
But all I could think about was the sting

Since you've gone nothing's been the same

The wind don't sing and the sky's so dim
I've seen her staring up to it saying
Don't leave
Don't leave this world to me
Don't leave
Don't leave this world to me
When the winter calls to war
When the spring sets in once more
When the summer starts to sing
When the fall comes marching in
You'll leave
You'll leave this world to me
You'll leave
You'll leave this world to me
