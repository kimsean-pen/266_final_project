Calling calling all the world
Why do you have to be this way
Calling calling all the world
Why do you have to be afraid

I know things are bad
We can make them good
You might think its crazy
But I know we could
Change life and make it better
Think about the future

Calling calling all the world
I know we're not a pretty sight
Calling calling all the world
It's up to us to make it right
Calling calling all the world
Why can't wars just cease
Calling calling all the world
Live together in love and peace

I know things are bad
We can make them good
You might think its crazy
But I know we could
Change life and make it better
Think about the future

Calling calling all the world
Why do you have to be this way
Calling calling all the world
Why do you have to be afraid

I know things are bad
We can make them good
You might think its crazy
But I know we could
Change life and make it better
Think about the future
