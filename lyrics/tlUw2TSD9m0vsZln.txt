It'll leave you with nothin' to say
Lost without a way
Ain't it funny, child,
Love sometimes leaves you as dead as yesterday
Hoping to hold a handful of sunshine
Like a child told it cannot play
Never ever figured, Lord, love would leave me feeling
As dead as yesterday
Oh Lord, could you help me find some shelter?
Oh Lord, could you help me find some shelter?
Oh Lord, could you help me find some shelter?
Oh Lord, could you help me find some shelter, yeah
It'll leave you feeling hollow and helpless
And there is where you'll stay
Ain't it funny, child, love sometimes leaves you
As dead as yesterday
As dead as yesterday
As dead as yesterday
