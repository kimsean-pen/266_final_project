Never quit until the clock stops
And never die out until your heart drops
Success will separate you from the have not's
And have all of the haters at your neck like an ascot
You could do it too young world
I remember being exactly like you young girl
But wait...
You can do it too young man
You'll be fine as long as on your own two you stand

Keep on livin', keep on breathin'
Even when you don't believe it
Keep on climbin', keep on reachin'
Even when this world can't see it
Know impossible is nothing
Even when you don't believe it
Impossible is nothing
Even when this world can't see it
Impossible is nothing

Gotta hate to not have it more than you'd love to obtain it
Your future's around the corner so close you can almost taste it
It gets worst before it's better, that storm you gon' have to weather
Either be a busted pipe or a diamond due to this pressure
25 hours, 8 days out the week
Focus, keep eyes open, victory never sleeps
My prayer for you is that you hit all them goals you tryna reach
I even hope at one point, that you take it farther than me

Keep on livin', keep on breathin'
Even when you don't believe it
Keep on climbin', keep on reachin'
Even when this world can't see it
Know impossible is nothing
Even when you don't believe it
Impossible is nothing
Even when this world can't see it
Impossible is nothing

I shall never let 'em see me sweat
Promise to want for more until my very last breath
Promise to blaze a path and leave a trail for the next
And never sell out my soul for any number on a cheque
I shall never let 'em see me sweat
Promise to want for more until my very last breath
Promise to blaze a path and leave a trail for the next
Just promise me when I'm gone you won't forget

Keep on livin', keep on breathin'
Even when you don't believe it
Keep on climbin', keep on reachin'
Even when this world can't see it
No, impossible is nothing
Even when you don't believe it
Impossible is nothing
Even when this world can't see it
Impossible is nothing
