I was a wing in heaven blue
On the ocean
Soared in the rain
And I was free,
I needed nobody
It was beautiful
It was beautiful

I was a pawn
Couldn't make a move
Couldn't go nowhere
Nowhere to go
Yet, I was free
I needed nobody
It was beautiful
It was beautiful

And if there's one thing
Could do for you
You'd be a wing
In heaven blue

I was a vision in another eye
And I saw nothing
No future at all
Yet, I was free
I needed nobody
It was beautiful
It was beautiful

And if there's one thing
Could do for you
You'd be a wing
In heaven blue

And if there's one thing
Could do for you
You'd be a wing
In heaven blue
And if there's one thing
Could do for you
You'd be a wing
In heaven blue
