Fallen are the people of a decaying race
Now proclaiming the legacy inherited too late - too late

Mankind - The dying creed, Reared on ignorance and greed
On suffering we feed devouring all beyond our needs

A path of self destruction they cannot see
Regarding their only interest in profitability - They cannot see

Open our mind before it is too late
Unlock the chains of confinement that we create

Grasping all that you can â€“ overloaded capacity
Nothing can conceal instinctive rapacity

A movement to disaster could this be the final plan
Blinded by our avarice, the closing chapter, extinction of man

Mankind - the dying creed, Reared on ignorance and greed
On suffering we feed, devouring all beyond our needs
