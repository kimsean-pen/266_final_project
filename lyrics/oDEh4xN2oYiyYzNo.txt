Sometimes I wonder do you
Even recognize the woman
That's standing in front of you

Listen, sometimes I wonder do you
...
Even care or realize why I took care of you
...
'Cuz you're my heart
You are my soul

You're my other half
Without you I cannot be whole baby
So far apart
I just don't know
What drove us apart in the first place

Now I know baby
Why
These tears I cry sure won't be the last
...

They will not be the last no
...
'Cuz this pain inside never seems to pass
...

It never seems to pass me by
...
So I thank you
Said I thank you
Yes I thank you

For making me a woman
Sometimes I wonder could she be

More of a woman to you than you are a man to me
...
Listen, sometime I wonder . why me
...
I'm here miserable while you're out living your fantasies
And didn't care
'Cuz you're my heart

You are my soul
You're my other half
Without you I cannot be whole baby
So far apart

I just don't know
What drove us apart in the first place
Now I know baby
Why

These tears I cry sure won't be the last
They will not be the last . no
...
Cuz' this pain inside which never seems to pass
...
It never seems to pass me by

So I thank you
Said I thank you
Yes I thank you
For making me a woman

One thing I learned in life
We all gotta be ready to sacrifice to survive
...
I hope she's happy

'Cuz you're the chapter that I'll be closing
Hope you're happy
'Cuz once my door close it won't be open
These tears I cry sure won't be the last
...
They will not be the last no
This pain inside which never seems to pass
...
It never seems to pass me by
So I thank you
Said I thank you
Yes I thank you
For making me a woman
So I thank you
Said I thank you
Yes I thank you
For making me a woman
