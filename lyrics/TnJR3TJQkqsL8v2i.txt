Delicious and naughty, delicious and naughty
Gumdrop, lollipop
Take a lick and don't stop

There's a party going down on a Saturday night
In the limo, windows down, baby I'm quite a sight
Don't be jealous of what I got
Not everyone can be this hot

All the pink lips, fingertips
Skinny dips and ego trips
That your money can buy

Delicious and naughty
Feel a shock to the body
It's electric sugar pop
Your heartbeat's racin'
With anticipation
I'm electric sugar pop
Gumdrop, lollipop
Take a lick and don't stop
So sweet, such a treat
I'm the king of candy
It's so sugary sweet
I'm electric sugar pop pop pop

(Pop, pop, pop)
(It's electric ...)
(Pop pop, pop)

Feel the energy around me - it's such a rush
Lemme tell ya, Oh, Hush! makes me blush
Cotton candy and champagne
That keeps us in the game

Yeah, I'm a princess, a hot mess
A tiger in a short dress
Let's party tonight

Delicious and naughty
Feel a shock to the body
It's electric sugar pop
Your heartbeat's racin'
With anticipation
I'm electric sugar pop
Gumdrop, lollipop
Take a lick and don't stop
So sweet, such a treat
I'm the king of candy
It's so sugary sweet
I'm electric sugar pop pop pop

You know I'm everything that you ever wished for
I'm on the top all time, don't even keep score
I'm sweet as honey and I know you have a taste for
This sugar pop's - popping on the dance floor ...

Delicious and naughty
Feel a shock to the body
It's electric sugar pop
Your heartbeat's racin'
With anticipation
I'm electric sugar pop
Gumdrop, lollipop
Take a lick and don't stop
So sweet, such a treat
I'm the king of candy
It's so sugary sweet
I'm electric sugar pop pop pop

(Pop, pop, pop)
It's electric sugar pop pop pop

(Pop pop, pop)
It's electric sugar pop pop pop
