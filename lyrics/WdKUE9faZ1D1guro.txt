Listen up
There's not a moment to spare
It's quite a drop from the top
So how you feeling down there?
It's a cold, cruel, harsh reality
Caught, stuck, here with your enemies

Who do you think you are?
Tearing us all apart
Where did you think you could go?
'Cause everyone already knows
It's 20 to 1
Yeah, so you better run

You got the world on its knees
You're taking all that you please
You want more
You want more
But you'll get nothing from me
You like the burden we bear
You love the hate that we share
You want more
You wnat more
But you'll get nothing from me but enemies!
Enemies

You started something that you just couldn't stop
You turn the ones that you love
Into an angry ass mob
And the one last wish is that you pay for it
And there's no way you're getting out of this

Who do you think you are?
Tearing us all apart
Where did you think you could go?
'Cause everyone already knows
It's 20 to 1
Yeah, so you better run

You got the world on its knees
You're taking all that you please
You want more
You want more
But you'll get nothing from me
You like the burden we bear
You love the hate that we share
You want more
You want more
But you'll get nothing from me but enemies!
Enemies!
Enemies!

Where did you think you could go?

You want more

But you'll get nothing from me
You like the burden we bear
