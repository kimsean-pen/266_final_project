Alone again again alone
Patiently waiting by the phone
Hoping that You will call me home
The pain inside my love denied
Hopes and dreams swallowed by pride
Everything I need it lies in You

'Cause I'm broken
You know I need You now
Deep inside I'm broken
You see the way I live
I know, know Your heart is broken
When I turn away
I need to be broken
Take the pain away

Yeah

I question why You chose to die
When you knew your truth I would deny
You look at me
The tears begin to fall(they fall)
And all in all faith is blind

But I fail time after time
Daily in my sin I take Your life

'Cause I'm broken
You know I need You now
Deep inside I'm broken
You see the way I live
I know, know Your heart is broken
When I turn away

I need to be broken
Take the pain away
Yeah

All the hate deep inside
Slowly covering my eyes
All these things I hide
Away from You again

All this fear holding me
My heart is cold and I believe
Nothing's gonna change
Until I'm broken

'Cause I'm broken
You know I need You now
Deep inside I'm broken
You see the way I live
I know, know Your heart is broken
When I turn away
I need to be broken
Take the pain away
Yeah
Broken!
Broken!
Broken!
Broken!
