If I could be honest, here in this moment
I've been so nervous to stand here with you
They're all here for us and I feel their aura
But just for a moment I'll pretend it's just you

Yes they can hear us, but they don't understand
I have said all of my vows behind the curtains
I know they see us, but they don't stand a chance
I have kissed those lips a thousand times before this

Tomorrow I'll open in my eyes
And I will whisper to my wife
"I belong to you"
And I will wait to hear you say
As a tear rolls down your face
"I belong to you"

If I could be honest, here at the altar
I refuse to grow older unless it's with you
I fell in love and made you a promise
Though I'd never noticed how much it meant to you

Yes they can hear us, but they misunderstand
There is more behind these words that we have spoken
I know they see us, but only at a glance
Only you know the man that I am beyond the surface

Tomorrow I'll open in my eyes
And I will whisper to my wife
"I belong to you"
And I will wait to hear you say
As a tear rolls down your face
"I belong to you"

I belong with you
When they let us choose
I will say I do
I belong with you
When they let us choose
I will say I do

Tomorrow I'll open in my eyes
And I will whisper to my wife
"I belong to you"
And I will wait to hear you say
As a tear rolls down your face
"I belong to you"
