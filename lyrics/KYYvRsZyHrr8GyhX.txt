Black Angels laughing in the city streets
Street toys scream in pain and clench their teeth
The moonlight spotlights all the city's crime
And got no religion, laugh while they fight

Save our souls for the heavens
For a life so good, it sure feels bad
Save our souls for the heavens
Save our souls for the promised land

Sweet tarts play the game and shoot to thrill
Running through the trash, dressed to kill
The midnight show-stoppers, it's a funny money game
A hundred thousand bleeding hearts put us in our graves

Save our souls for the heavens
For a life so good, it sure feels bad
Save our souls for the heavens
Save our souls for the promised land
Save our souls

Well, it's been a hard road, edge of an overdose
No matter how high, well, you're still too low
I've been the dancer, the wicked romancer
A never-ending nightmare, edge of disaster

Save our souls for the heavens
For a life so good, it sure feels bad, yeah
Save our souls for the heavens
Save our souls for the promised land
Save our souls for the promised land
Save our souls for the promised land
