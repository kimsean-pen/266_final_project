All that I see is beautiful faces
Smiling at me from the darkest of places
Praying for love with a gun in their hands
Can you comprehend?
We're already dead so

(Give it up) Can you put it down?
(Live it up) Until you're buried underground
(Pick it up) Ooh yeah yeah, If you're not too proud
(Live it up) Until you're buried underground

All that I hear is innocent voices
Singing to free themselves from their choices
Praying for light with their heads in the sand
Do you understand?
This is just how it ends so

(Give it up) Can you put it down?
(Live it up) Until you're buried underground
(Pick it up)Ooh yeah yeah, If you're not too proud
(Live it up) Until you're buried underground

(Give it up) Can you put it down?
(Live it up) Until you're buried underground
(Pick it up) Ooh yeah yeah, If you're not too proud
(Live it up) Until you're buried underground

All that I see is beautiful faces
Smiling at me and talking of freedom
Racing around to secure their places
Pleading their cases
They're too scared to face it
