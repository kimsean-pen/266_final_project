When I say I'm in love you best believe
I'm in love, L U V

I always saw you, just before the dawn
When all the other kids, were just draggin' along
I couldn't believe the way it seemed to be
Rememberin' the things, you used to say to me

I bet you know I can't be wastin' time
'Cause I gotta have my fun, I gotta get some fun
I got to keep on movin', can't stop till it's all done
And never done

Well, listen when I tell ya, you got no time for fix
'Cause I just gotta make it, can't afford to miss
And there's one reason, I'm tellin' you this
I feels bad and I'm looking for a kiss

Why won'tcha tell me, why those kids are moving so slow?
Is it that they just don't have a place to go
When the day starts breakin', the sun is gonna shine
It's hard to sleep, if I been cryin'

Then all the old ladies they are on their way to the church
You goin' to the church? I bet here I'll be a golden boy
Lookin' for the thing that I search, I keep on searchin'

Well, listen when I tell ya, you got no time for fix
'Cause I just gotta make it, can't afford to miss
If there's one reason, I'm tellin' you this
I feels bad, bad, bad and I'm looking for a kiss
Well I'm looking for a real hot kiss, come on kiss me

You think it's bad, but you know it's true
So why won't you just let me live, baby
When I'm lookin' for a kiss

When everyone goes to your house, they shoot up in your room
Most of them are beautiful, but so obsessed with gloom
I ain't gonna be here, when they all get home
They're always lookin' at me, they won't leave me alone

I didn't come here, lookin' for no fix, I know
I been houndin' all streets all night long late
Baby just looking for a kiss

I need a fixin' a kiss, I need a fixin' a kiss
I need a fixin' a kiss, I've been looking for a kiss
I didn't come here, lookin' for no fix, I know

I been haulin' booty, all night long
Baby just looking for a kiss
