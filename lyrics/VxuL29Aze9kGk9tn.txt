Well that'll be the day
When you say goodbye
That'll be the day
When you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave
You know it's a lie
Cause that'll be the day that I die

Well that'll be the day
When you say goodbye
That'll be the day
When you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave
You know it's a lie
Cause that'll be the day that I die

Well you gave me all your loving
And your turtle doving
All your hugs and kisses
And your money too
You know you love me baby
Still you tell me baby
That someday when I'll be true

Well that'll be the day
When you say goodbye
That'll be the day
When you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave me
You know it's a lie
Cause that'll be the day that I die

When Cupid shot his dart
He shot it at your heart
So if we ever part then I'll be blue
You kiss and hold me
And you tell me boldy
Well that someday that I'll be true

Well that'll be the day
When you say goodbye
That'll be the day
When you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave me
You know it's a lie
Cause that'll be the day that I die

Ah that'll be the day wooh-ooh-ooh
That'll be the day woo-ooh-ooh
That'll be the day woo-ooh-ooh
That'll be the day when I die
