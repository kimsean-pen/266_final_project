Agents of abomination
Trinity of the damned
One devil that kills, one that takes
One that calls me his son

The wave will hit you soon
The ambassadors of doom

Black trinity
Turn away
Black trinity
Until we close our case
Black trinity
Set me free
Black trinity
Imaginary, your reality

His disciples long for disaster
From the pits, they're marching faster
Flaming angels from burning thrones
In shields golden semidome
The wave will hit you soon
The ambassadors of doom

Black trinity
Turn away
Black trinity
Until we close our case
Black trinity
Set me free
Black trinity
Imaginary, your reality

Tyrants learned it's in the spine
Walking the Earth, dirty divine
Caustic idols in human guise
They keep all drunk until the sparkle dies

Black trinity
