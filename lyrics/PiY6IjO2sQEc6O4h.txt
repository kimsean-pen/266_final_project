There's no hiding whom
When every wound
Brings the darkest place to light
So why not assume
That straight out of the womb
I've been marked by a beast of some kind
(Marked by a beast of some kind)
And there are so many reasons why

You're not crazy for leaving
Just crazy for staying so long
I'm amazed you're still breathing
Amazed you can feel at all
For all the pain I caused
I'm the one crazy after all
The one crazy after all
There's no need for signs
When your crying eyes said a million words a night
I'd rather die than see you do time for all the wrongs that you can't make right

You're not crazy for leaving
Just crazy for staying so long
I'm amazed you're still breathing
Amazed you can feel at all
For all the pain I caused
I'm the one crazy after all

I'm so far gone found my way back to broken somehow
Yeah when you moved on I can't find my way out

You're not crazy for leaving
Just crazy for staying so long
I'm amazed you're still breathing
Amazed you can feel at all
For all the pain I caused
I'm the one crazy after all
(The one crazy after all)
I'm the one crazy after all
The one crazy after all
I'm the one crazy after all
I'm crazy
