Don't you misfire fill me up
With the desire to carry on
Don't you know honey, that love's a game
It's always hit or miss, so take your aim
Got to hold on tight, shoot me out of sight
Don't you misfire fill me up
With the desire to carry on

Don't you misfire fill me up
With the desire to carry on
Your gun is loaded, and pointing my way
There's only one bullet, so don't delay
Got to time it right, fire me through the night
Come on, take a shot
Fire me higher
Don't you miss this time
Please don't misfire
Misfire
