You might never meet me,
For I am King.
And as we march into the storms eyes,
I find relief in the rain.
I can hind as I lead my army,
Into certain death.

Eyes over you.
Eyes over you.

Feel alive.
Feel alive.
Feel alive.
Feel alive.

And I wanted you to know,
Today won't go down in stone.
(Feel Alive)

And I wanted you to know,
I never meant for this.
(Close your eyes)

And I wanted you to know,
I never meant for this.
(Close your eyes)

Today won't go down in history,
So shut your eyes
