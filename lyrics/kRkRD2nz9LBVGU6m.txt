She keeps it simple and I
am thankful for her kind of lovin'
'cause it's simple

no longer do we wonder
if we're together we're way passed that
and I've already asked her

so in January
we're getting married

she's talking to me
with her voice so low
I barely hear her

but I know what she's sayin'
I understand because my heart
and hers are the same

and in January
we're getting married

and I was sick with heartache
and she was sick like Audrey Hepburn
when I met her

but we will both surrender
true love is not the kind of thing you
should turn down

don't ever
turn it down

I hope that I don't sound too
insane when I say
there is darkness
all around us

I don't feel weak but I do
need sometimes for her
to protect me
and reconnect me
to the beauty
that I'm missing

and in January
we're getting married

no longer does it matter
what circumstances we were born in
she knows which birds are singing
and the names of the trees
where they're performing
in the morning

and in January
we're getting married

come January
lets get married
