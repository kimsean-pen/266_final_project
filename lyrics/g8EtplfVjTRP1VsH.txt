do you remember that time
the time you shut the love is it is so hard to combine
the trees left me just a fire
is now always like that none explain why
cause there's a place to be who we want to
do what we want to
let me give you the one in the life time
just girl
i could go all alone
but don't want to bought you don't
to the right thing
let me show you what've you missing
oh can you feel it?
