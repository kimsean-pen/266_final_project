I've got sand in my joints.
I'm counting the grains.
And they're so sharp...
I'm feeling the pain.

I'm like King Canute's daughter.
A lamb to the slaughter.
My feet in the water,
It's not what they think.
It's not what it seems...

I've got sand in my joints.
I'm counting the grains.
And they're so sharp...
I'm feeling the pain,
pain, pain.

Feeling the pain, p-p-pain.
Feeling the pain, p-p-pain.
Feeling the pain, p-p-pain.
Feeling the pain, p-p-pain, p-p-pain.
