I still remember a year ago
The times we spent
I think that I'm happier now
Up from the down
By all means
It's strange 'cause I feel the same way

I think of what it looks like
I think of what it tastes like
I think of what it looks like
I think of what it tastes like

Same strange
Said it's strange 'cause I feel the same
Same strange
Said it's strange 'cause I feel the same

Still remember what it tastes like
What it felt like

Makes me ill, me ill

I think of what it looks like
I think of what it tastes like
I think of what it looks like
I think of what it tastes like

Same strange
Said it's strange 'cause I feel the same
Same strange
Said it's strange 'cause I feel the same

Same strange
(Still remember what it tastes like)
Said it's strange 'cause I feel the same
Same strange
(What it felt like)
Said it's strange 'cause I feel the same

Yeah, makes me ill
Makes me ill
Makes me, makes me
Got to get to you
(Still remember what it tastes like)
Got to get to you
(What it felt like)
You, you
Got to get to you
