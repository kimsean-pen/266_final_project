Where hath the Apostles gone?
Joining hands with wicked ones
Revelation has come to pass
New World Order will hold the mass

A book written by the man
Used to control and command
All rights will be denied
Without the mark you shall die

No confession, all is known (all is known)
New World Order, you shall be shown (shall be shown)
No confession, all is known (all is known)
New World Order, you shall be shown

Monitoring all wages
New World Order comes in stages
Currency is obsolete
Feel the agony of defeat

A symbol of society today
A must have or you shall pay
As humans flesh leads the mind
Just as a pawn, the last martyr dies

No confession, all is known (all is known)
New World Order, you shall be shown (shall be shown)
No confession, all is known (all is known)
New World Order, you shall be shown

Where hath the Apostles gone?
Joining hands with wicked ones
Revelation has come to pass
New World Order, complete disorder
Will hold the mass
