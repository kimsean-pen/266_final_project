This last one-way ticket train pulls in
We smile for the casual closure capturing
There goes the downpour
Here goes my fare thee well

There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
'Cause I'm already gone

There's only so many words that we could say
Spoken upon long-distance melody.
This is my hello
This is my goodness

There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
'Cause I'm already gone

Maybe in five or ten yours and mine will meet again
Straighten this whole thing out.
Maybe then honesty need not be feared as a friend or an enemy
This is the distance
This is my gameface

There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
Is there really no way to reach me
Am I already
So this is your Maverick
This is Vienna
