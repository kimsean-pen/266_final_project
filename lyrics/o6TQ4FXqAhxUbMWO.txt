And it's okay
And it's okay
And it's okay
And it's okay

And it's okay
You give me everything I need
And it's okay
You give me everything I need

Whispers
Elevators
Bad boy
Drive

New York girl
Bang
Weird thing
Huge

Amazing
Download
Something
Paradise

And it's okay
You give me everything I need
And it's okay
You give me everything I need

I got your picture on
Whispers, bad boy
Elevator, agitator
New York girl, corkscrew hair

Bang, now
Wanna be, wanna be stars
Through these joyous times

And it's okay
You give me everything I need
And it's okay
You give me everything I need
