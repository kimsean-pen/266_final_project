Tonight, I think I might explode
Yeah, nothing's right, nothing's right
Comfort me until the sun arrives

Oh, you can't go ratting me out this time
You can't go ratting me out this time, no
Can't go ratting me out this time
You can't go ratting me out this time

Carry me
Are you strong enough to make me feel complete
Like there's church in my heart?
Carry me
Are you strong enough to make me numb and free
Like there's nothing to fear in the dark?

I've been filling up the ditch with anything that I can fit
Comfort me and get me through the night

Oh, you can't go ratting me out this time
You can't go ratting me out this time, no
Can't go ratting me out this time
You can't go ratting me out this time

Carry me
Are you strong enough to make me feel complete
Like there's church in my heart
Carry me
Are you strong enough to make me numb and free
Like there's nothing to fear in the dark?

Sometimes it takes ahold
Sometimes it takes a toll on me
Sometimes it takes ahold
Sometimes it takes a hold on me

Carry me
Are you strong enough to make me feel complete
Like there's church in my heart?
Carry me
Are you strong enough to make me numb and free
Like there's nothing to fear in the dark?
