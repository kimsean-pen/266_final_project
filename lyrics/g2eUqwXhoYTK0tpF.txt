You said it was gonna be easy
Now you're driving away
(i've) got no tears to share.
And i sold every feeling you gave me
now i'm all on my own
does it show you were right?

(now comes the solo)

My smile used to save your vision
Now you won't rest at night
If I am by your side.
And you drunk all the flavours they gave you
Boy you know where I am
I still need you tonight.

(now comes the solo)

Now I know what's like to be afraid
you're right
And you watered my life
I need you by my side
You know how it felt when you treated me like a friend
But you know where you gonna go.
