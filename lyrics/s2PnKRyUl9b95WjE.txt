You must leave now take what you need
You think will last
But whatever you wish to keep you better grab it fast

Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
Look out baby, the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now baby blue

The highway is for gamblers better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
The sky too is fallin in over you- ooo
And it's all over now baby blue

Leave your stepping stones behind
There's something that calls for you
Forget the debt you left that will not follow you

Your lover who has just walked through the door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet too is foldin' over you
And it's all over now baby blue

Well strike another match, yeah, go start a-new
Go start a-new
'Cause it's all over now baby blue
Hey, hey, yeah
It's all over, it's all over now baby blue
It's all over, it's all over now oh yeah

It's all over now, it's all over now baby blue
