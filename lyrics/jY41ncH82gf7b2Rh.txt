The sun above your head, I am home
The day was looking good, but I guess I spoke too soon
You couldn't shut your eyes while I was dreaming inside,
You didn't even knock upon my door.

But you didn't really do that, did you?
You could've had it back, but I held you
You had it pretty good until the end
You didn't really do that, did you?

The stars were in your eyes and mine, too
You couldn't trust the moon over my head
You said you had it better back then, did you?
But you didn't really mean that, did you?
You could've said anything else
You could've had it back, but I held you
You had it pretty good, until the end
You didn't really mean that, did you?

Your hair is falling out my embrace
The time is passing right before our eyes
The stars are dead, but they still shed light

You didn't really do that, did you?
You could've had it back, but i held you
You had it pretty good, until the end
But you didn't really do that...
You didn't really do that...
You didn't really do that, did you?
