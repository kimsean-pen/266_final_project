Ricky played the flute
But she never had a use for it
Miming her part in the school band
While I took a solo on the saxophone
And I learned harmony
But she could dance, she could move
Like the girls on the TV

Mum took her to Johnny Young Talent School
But she quit
She said that she got scared
When they made her do the splits
She tried tap school and blew the teacher away
But the girls in the class teased her
Saying she was too chubby

I remember when she told me
She cried in shame
I told her not to worry
We can do anything
I told her one day we'd be beautiful
And maybe we could start a band
'cos I was born to sing
And she was born to dance
She was born to dance like the

Girls on the TV, girls on the TV
She could always dance better than the
Girls on the TV, 10am R 'n' B
She could always dance better than me

She was bullied all day
And made to feel like a fool
Mum was born again and decided
To send her to the Christian school
On Thursdays her friends
Would dance in the spirit
At the school church but Ricky laughed
And never believed in it

We moved in with Mum's first
Boyfriend after Dad
He was only 21 and he'd always get mad
While I hid in my room
Writing poems after school
He tried to kiss Ricky
On the piano stool

I remember when she told me
She was on cocaine
I felt like I didn't know her
Or how she got that way
Now, her lovers are all married
I wear my wedding ring
On my right hand
Maybe we weren't meant to settle down
No, I was born to sing
And she was born to dance like the

Girls on the TV
Girls on the TV
She could always dance better than the
Girls on the TV, 10am R 'n' B
She could always dance better than the
Girls on the TV
