Waiting down at the station
I don't remember
I think it was late then
Standing always so quiet
We're like elevators
Filled up with strangers

No sound, no Hallelujahs
Still I was prayin' on the train ride home
That I can get the things I want
I can get the things I want
Give me what I need

Our words fill up the pages
Fill up the days with
A song for the ages
Still those browse and we all speak
We break down like concrete
And just make our words cheap

I want someone to grow with
Songs I can sing to
And a family to cling to
But if I can't get the things I want
If I can't get the things I want
Just give me what I need
Just give me what I need
