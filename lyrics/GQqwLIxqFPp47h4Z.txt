When the world starts to crumble
I'm looking for diamonds in the rubble
It won't tear me down
No, it won't tear me down

When the desert freezes over
You and me were moving closer
It won't tear us down
No, it won't tear us down

Look at the stars tonight
We're leaving the dark behind
For a brand new day
For a brand new day

Even the wrong seems right
Coloured in black and white
On this brand new day
On this brand new day

(It won't tear us down)
(No, it won't tear us down)
(It won't tear us down)
(No, it won't tear us down)
(It won't tear us down)
(No, it won't tear us down)
(It won't tear us down)
(No, it won't tear us down)

Look at the stars tonight
We're leaving the dark behind
For a brand new day
For a brand new day

Even the wrong seems right
Coloured in black and white
On this brand new day
On this brand new day
