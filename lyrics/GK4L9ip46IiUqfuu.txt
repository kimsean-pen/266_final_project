It's 6 AM
The clock is ringing
I need to spend
An hour snoozing

'Coz I don't think I'm gonna make it
I punch in
I'm still sleeping
Watch the clock

But it's not moving
Cause everyday is never ending
I need to work
I'm always spending

And I feel like
I'm living the worst day
Over and over again
And I feel like the summer is leaving again

I feel like I'm living the worst day
I feel like you're gone
And every day
Is the worst day ever

Yesterday was the worst day ever
And tomorrow won't be better
It's history repeating on and on
Summer plans are gone forever

I'd trade them in for dishpan water
And everyday is never ending
I need to work
I'm always spending

And I feel like I'm living the worst day
Over and over again
And I feel like the summer
Is leaving again

I feel like I'm living the worst day
I feel like you're gone
And every day is the worst day ever
Whoa every day is the worst day ever

It's so long
I can't go on
It's so long
I can't go on

And I feel like I'm living the worst day
Over and over again
And I feel like the summer
Is leaving again

I feel like I'm living the worst day
I feel like you're gone
And every day
Is the worst day ever

Whoa every day
Is the worst day ever
Oh whoa oh
Is the worst day ever.
