Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike

He's down on his luck
It's tough, so tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man

She brings home her pay for love
For love

She says: We've got to hold on to what we've got
'Cause it doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love -
We'll give it a shot

Wooah
We're half way there
Woah-oh
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it
I swear, livin' on a prayer

Tommy got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk
So tough, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night
Tommy whispers: Baby
It's okay, someday

We've got to hold on to what we've got
'Cause it doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love -
We'll give it a shot

Wooah
We're half way there
Woah-oh
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh
Livin' on a prayer
Livin' on a prayer

We've got to hold on ready or not
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got

Wooah
We're half way there
Woah-oh
Livin' on a prayer

Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh
Livin' on a prayer

Wooah
We're half way there
Woah-oh
Livin' on a prayer

Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh
Livin' on a prayer
Wooah
We're half way there
