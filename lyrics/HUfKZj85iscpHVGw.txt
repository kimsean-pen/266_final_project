Mer
floating her words
melted she said
I long for that
We met
followed the map
looked for the gold
I long for you
Even if the reasons change
it's never gonna freeze again
even if the matters change
we're all gonna remain the same
even if we face the end
thoughts are gonna stay
as cells though
all that is what I want
all that is what I want
Across another river
reached the ocean just before sunset
bombing started with a roar
yet we're unfazed we're unamazed
we're staying calm and chasing
other details not that easy though
all that is what I want
all that is what I want
Mer
one for myself
one for the wish
I long for you
We met
one is for you
one for the gold
I long for that
Even if the reasons change
it's never gonna freeze again
even if the matters change
we're all gonna remain the same
even if we face the end
thoughts are gonna stay
as cells though
all that is what I want
all that is what I want
Across another river
reached the ocean just before sunset
bombing started with a roar
yet we're unfazed we're unamazed
we're staying calm and chasing
other details not that easy though
all that is what I want
all that is what I want
