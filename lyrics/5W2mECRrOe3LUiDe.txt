I Just Can't Be Happy Today
I Just Can't Be Happy Today

A lot of you know there's nothing to smile
There's no feeling fine without being fined
It's a price on your head
No point being sad when justice is red

I Just Can't Be Happy Today
I Just Can't Be Happy Today

They're closing the schools
They're burning the books
The church is in ruins
The priests hang on hooks
The radios on ice
The telly's been banned
The army's in power
The devil commands

Illegal to dance Forbidden to cry
You do what you're told and never ask why
Ignore all those fools
They don't understand we make our own rules

I Just Can't Be Happy Today
I Just Can't Be Happy Today
I Just Can't Be Happy, Just Can't Be Happy, Just Can't Be Happy Today
I Just Can't Be Happy, Just Can't Be Happy, Just Can't Be Happy Today
