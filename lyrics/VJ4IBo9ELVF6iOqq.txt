Sitting all alone again
Here I find myself alone again
But I don't know what it is
Do I push people away or am I shy
Maybe I am shy.
Sitting all by myself
All I've got is me and my good health
But i want more something real
That will feel like more than run of the mill
Run of the mill.
Ohhhh ooooooohhhhh
Bum bum bum bum bum bum
More than run of the mill
More than run of the mill
(Fades Out)
