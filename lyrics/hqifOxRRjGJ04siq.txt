One night it's only been one night
Remember I said I'll see you again
Calling why you keep calling
Like you need it like you desperate

You're so high, high maintenance
High, high maintenance
Yeah you pushing me away

You been on my case when I've been messing around yeah
We should take a break because it's breaking me down
Woah oh oh oh
Won't you gimme a gimme a break
Won't you gimme a gimme a
All my girls are saying I'm supposed to have fun
And I don't need nobody to be locking me down
Woah oh oh oh
Won't you gimme a gimme a break
Won't you gimme a gimme a

Too much you're doing it too much
Take a few steps take a few breaths

You're so high, high maintenance
High, high maintenance
Yeah you pushing me away

You been on my case when I've been messing around yeah
We should take a break because it's breaking me down
Woah oh oh oh
