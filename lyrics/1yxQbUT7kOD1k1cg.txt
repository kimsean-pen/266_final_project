All the songs that I've sung here
More often than you know
'Cause you're the lull that I've countered
More often than I've let it show

And I, I wish you would leave me
And I, I wish you would go
And I, I wish you didn't need me
And I, I wish I didn't love you so

'Cause I just can't go on
So please don't do me wrong
No, I won't do you harm
My love for you goes on & on

There's no one else I want beside you
Give me a cold shoulder to cry upon
You're never anywhere I find you
You're never anything I rely upon

And I, I wish you would leave me
And I, I wish you would go
And I, I wish you didn't need me
And I, I wish I didn't know

But I just can't go on
So please don't do me wrong
No I won't do you harm
My love for you goes on & on & on & on

No, I just can't go on
So please don't do me wrong
No I won't do you harm
'Cause my love goes on & on

And on & on
And on & on
And on & on
...
