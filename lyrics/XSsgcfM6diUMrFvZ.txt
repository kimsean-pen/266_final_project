Wide awake and he shakes in a panic
never woke up alone ever before
had his woman long as he can remember
tries to forget, but he can't, he can't...
out of bed and he dreams in the shower
she's standing naked and apologizing
reaches for her 'till his mind becomes blood hot
woken up to be burned, burned, again...
go it alone
you got it, so it goes
i wanna breathe and i said
i can't take it any other way
On the streets he's walkin', wounded
doesn't smile for the child at play
thoughts of suicide and alleviation
anything to get his heart off of the coals
does he fly away or just talk about it
like a seagull born to cry in the wind
all experiences lead to a young girl
alone you will meet the one who lies in wait
go it alone
you got it, so it goes
try to breathe, but you can't
you can't take it any other way, yeah, yeah...
...myself, don't talk to me
i can help myself, don't talk to me
i can help myself, myself
i can help myself, don't talk to me (3x)
i can help myself, myself...
...myself, don't talk to me
i can help myself
Wide awake and he shakes in a panic
never woke up alone ever before
had his woman long as he can remember
tries to forget, but he can't, he can't, he can't, he can't...
