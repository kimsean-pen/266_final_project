I was spineless and ready to be thrown to the crows
A weak operation of a former slain
No salvation in desperation
Renounce your endless fears and rise

Incompletion
When I rise, perfection I will be

Reforged of purest kind
Reforged to survive
Reforged of purest kind
Reforged to survive

I want to make you mine
I want to be divine
An alteration you cannot deny
I am your everything
And when you understand fear
My face you always will see
Scared in your mind

Incompletion
When I rise, perfection I will be

Reforged of purest kind
Reforged to survive
Reforged of purest kind
Reforged to survive

I want to make you mine
I want to be divine
An alteration you cannot deny

Reforged of purest kind
Reforged to survive
Reforged of purest kind
Reforged to survive
Reforged of purest kind
Reforged to survive
