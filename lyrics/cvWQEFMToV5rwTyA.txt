We gather here to sing for you, the words you've written
Each bloodshot beauty still rings true, from violent crashes

Gently rest your weary head
What you live for now is dead

Goodnight
Goodbye
A soul surrender

This love will set you free from thoughts of yesterday
Now death has come to claim your Beautiful Remains

I'll strike the match to set you off, and watch you glisten
Our love's in time a single loss, you never listen

Gently rest your weary head
What you live for now is dead

Goodnight
Goodbye
A soul surrender

This love will set you free from thoughts of yesterday
Now death has come to claim your Beautiful Remains

Here in this room is what we must do
What we must do, what we must

This love will set you free from thoughts of yesterday
Now death has come to claim your Beautiful Remains

This love will set you free from thoughts of yesterday
Now death has come to claim your Beautiful Remains
