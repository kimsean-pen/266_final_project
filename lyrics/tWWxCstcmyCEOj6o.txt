Through the trees
Comes Autumn with her serenade
Melodies
The sweetest music ever played
Autumn kisses we knew
Are beautiful souvenirs
As I pause to recall
The leaves seem to fall like tears
Silver stars
Were clinging to an Autumn sky
Love was ours
Until October wandered by
Let the years come and go
I'll still feel the glow
That time cannot fade
When I hear
That lovely Autumn serenade
Love was ours
Until October wandered by
Let the years come and go
I'll still feel the glow
That time cannot fade
When I hear
That lovely Autumn serenade
Serenade
Serenade
