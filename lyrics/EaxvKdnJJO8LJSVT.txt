You took me runnin'
Up a wrong-way street.
When we got there,
You said, "Can't you read?"
I must be blind,
But now and then, I see
Another number
Where mine used to be.

You keep on changin' your face
Like a chameleon.
You keep on changing your face
Like a chameleon.

I say what's up,
And then you say it's down.
I see triangles,
And you say it's round, round, round.
Saw an empty glass;
You said it's full.
Lord, it's so hot,
Then you come on cool, cool.

You keep on changin' your face
Like a chameleon.
You keep on changing your face
Like a chameleon.
You keep on changin' your face
Like a chameleon.
You keep on painting your face
Like a chameleon.

You keep on changin' your face
Like a chameleon.
You keep on changing your face
Like a chameleon.
You keep on painting your face
Like a chameleon.
You keep on painting your face
Like a chameleon.
You keep on changing your face
Like a chameleon.
