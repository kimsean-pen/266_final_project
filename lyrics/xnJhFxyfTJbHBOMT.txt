Blackness awakens
Visions come alive
Seeing through darkness
With borrowed eyes

Death survivor
Take me higher
Reunite my soul

Whisperer of truth
I trust in you
To make me whole

Sun
Come shine my way
May healing waters bury all my pain

Wind
Carry me home
The fabric of reality is tearing apart
The piece of me that died
Will return
To live again

Feeling myself slip away
Suddenly dreaming awake
Hidden memories
Flooding back

I will not grow in the light
Until I pass through the darkest caverns of my heart

Dance with fire
Spirit guide erase the world outside

Messenger of truth
I trust in you
Transform me now

Sun
Come shine my way
May healing waters bury all my pain

Wind
Carry me home
The fabric of reality is tearing apart
The piece of me that died
Will return
To live again

And at last the time has come
To unite again as one

To the power of the Earth I'm calling
Crossing bridges in the sky
On a journey to renew my life
Shaman take my hand

Sun
Come shine my way
May healing waters bury all my pain
Wind
Carry me home
The fabric of reality is tearing apart
The piece of me that died
Will return
To live again
And at last the time has come
To unite again as one
To the power of the Earth I'm calling
Crossing bridges in the sky
On a journey to renew my life
Shaman take my hand
