It's not enough
To lay your head down on my chest
And talk about our future like we'd ever had a chance
Baby, there's no room to grow
We gotta let this go
Back away slow

We're not star crossed lovers
Falling over each other
We're not star crossed lovers
Don't tell me that it feels like love
When it's not
Don't tell me that it feels like love
Falling over
Don't tell me that it feels like love
We're not star crossed lovers
Falling over
Don't tell me that it feels like love
'Cause we're not star crossed lovers

We're not, we're not lovers, crossed, crossed
We're not, crossed lovers

Moment you laugh
Oh, the way you'd say my name
No more hearing rumors, no more asking for my space
Baby, I got no regrets
Our time's been spent
We're at the end

We're not star crossed lovers
Falling over each other
Every little thing that you do to me, asking for apologies
Oh, don't tell me that it feels like love when it's not
Don't tell me that it feels like love
Falling over
Don't tell me that it feels like love
We're not star crossed lovers
Falling over
Don't tell me that it feels like love
We're not star crossed lovers

We're not, we're not lovers, crossed, crossed
We're not, crossed lovers
