We used to play out in the rain
Your mother scolded us
She said that we were bad
(She said that we were bad)

I thought I better go on home
You watched till I was gone
Ooh, girl, you looked so sad

I picked you up when you fell
And cut your knee
I told you not to cry
And held you close to me

As I was running
Through the storm
To get my umbrella
(Think about it...)
I stopped in shock
When I saw you with
Another fellow, oh, wow

Can you remember the rain
Can you remember the rain
You left me for somebody else
Now I must face life by myself

You broke so many rules in school
I took the blame for you
I guess I was the fool

You used to sneak me notes in class
I winked my eye and laughed
Those days went by so fast

I heard remarks
That tore us all apart
I'm still trying to put back
The pieces to my heart

And I'll be crying your name, girl
Until my very last breath
(Think about it...)

'Cause my existence without you
Ain't nothing but a little death
Gosh

Can you remember the rain
Can you remember the rain

You left me for somebody else
Now I must face life by myself

Can you remember the rain
(Think about it...)
Can you remember the rain
(Think about it...)

Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby
(Can you remember the rain)
Baby, baby, baby, baby...
