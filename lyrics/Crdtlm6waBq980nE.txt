Stone cold
You wake me when the phone vibrates
Your voice sounds dulled
But loud enough to hear you
Distant echoes of my heart unbreak
Silently numb
I'm waiting for this storm to come
I'm waiting for this storm to come
Listen to you load that gun
I'm waiting for this storm to come

And with one strike
My world lights up in a fire
I call it a sign
Don't need hindsight
I'll make my emotions clear
And then disappear
With one strike
Mmm, one strike

Shattered
Pieces of your words take aim
Your poisoned tongue
But I don't want to believe you
Torn up, stitches of my own heart ache
Violently numb
I'm ready for this storm to come
I'm ready for this storm to come
Listen to you load that gun
I'm ready for this storm to come

And with one strike
My world lights up in a fire
I call it a sign
Don't need hindsight
I'll make my emotions clear
And then disappear
And with one strike
My world lights up in a fire
I call it a sign
And with one strike
Mmm, one strike

With one strike
With one strike
One strike
With one strike
With one strike

I don't want to stay, time to go
I don't want to be in this home
Broken promises, time to leave
I had everything that you needed
I don't want to stay, time to go
I don't want to be in this home
Broken promises, time to leave
I had everything that you needed

And with one strike
My world lights up in a fire
I call it a sign
Don't need hindsight
I'll make my emotions clear
And then disappear
And with one strike
Mmm, one strike

Ooh-ooh
Why'd you go lie?
Ooh-ooh
Why, oh, why?
Ooh-ooh
Watch you go by
Ooh-ooh
My, oh, my
