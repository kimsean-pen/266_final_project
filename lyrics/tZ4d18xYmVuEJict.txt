The way home
Lined with all the things that you have learned
The way home
The lights are on, but we're still getting burned
Show to me
The way I found, the grey lines honed
'Cause it's so hollow now
Show's over now
The way I'm lighting all the faces you have turned
The way is high
Glad to know the greatest thing I knew, I always knew
So hollow now
Show's over now
And I've wasted time on daylight
I won't be knocked down
Show the way
I've only time now
I always knew
So hollow now
Show's over now
And I've wasted time on daylight, sorry
And I've wasted time on daylight, sorry
The way home
