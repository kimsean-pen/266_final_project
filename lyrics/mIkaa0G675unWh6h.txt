I get to be devoted to him
An orchid's cherubim

Cherubim

I get to devote my life to him
I get to sing like the cherubim
I get to devote my life to him
I get to sing like the cherubim

Boy every time I worship you
My mouth is filled with honey
Boy as I build your throne
I feel myself growing
Sewing love into you is my job
Sewing love into you is my job
Anything else is a weak curse
Oh

I get to devote my life to him
I get to sing like the cherubim
I get to devote my life to him
I get to sing like the cherubim

Boy don't take your weight from me
Don't remove this mold from my chest
Boy I need, I need, I need
I need, your happiness
(Sewing love into you is my job)
Making love to you is my job
Anything else is a weak curse
Weak curse, weak curse
Weak curse

I get to devote my life to him
(I love you so much)
I get to sing like the cherubim
(I get to keep my mouth filled with you)
I get to devote my life to him
(Oh I love the taste of you)
I get to sing like the cherubim
(Boy you're so good to me, yeah)
I get to devote my life to him
(World so cold)
I get to sing like the cherubim
(Ever since I met you)
I get to devote my life to him
(You're so warm to me)
I get to sing like the cherubim
(You've been such an excellent love and light)

I get to devote my life to him
I get to sing like the cherubim
I get to devote my life to him
(Oh you, oh yeah)
I get to sing like the cherubim
