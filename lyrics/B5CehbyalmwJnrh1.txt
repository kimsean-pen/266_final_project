Choosers of slain

Ravens over battlefield are marking the chosen
Brave northern warriors to their last fight

Shieldmaidens ride the wolves in the sky with ravens
Scouting the battleground for souls of slain heroes

Choosers of slain

Valkyries ride through the night sky
Singing fierce battle-cries
Valkyries, choosers of slain, come ride their wolves

Valkyries ride through the night sky
Singing fierce battle-cries
Valkyries, choosers of slain, come ride their wolves

Howling wolves in the night carrying female deities
Escort the dead warriors to Odin's hall

Armour of Valkyries flashes up over the skies
Shading a strange light - the northern lights

Choosers of slain

Valkyries ride through the night sky
Singing fierce battle-cries
Valkyries, choosers of slain, come ride their wolves
