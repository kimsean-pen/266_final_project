He flies as a crow flies
straight to her

Why?

Tell her
something

He promises her he will not do
all the things
he has already
done to her

She flies as a crow flies
in a straight line
straight to him

Why?

Listen

Time flies as a crow flies
in a straight line
through you not around you
your life is only
that with which
time
has its
way with you

In the corner
of my eye
.
.
Underneath
.
.
.

Back street
in the corner
wait till
it gets warmer
.
do the honor
swing blade
underwater

Cuz
he's
calling
the crow
he's
calling
the crow

In the corner
of my eye
In the corner
is the sky
In the corner
with the birds
.
.

Cuz
he's
calling
the crow
he's
calling
the crow
he's
calling
the crow
he's
calling
the crow
