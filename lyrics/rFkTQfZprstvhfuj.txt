In a place so loud we will never be free.
Just a slave to a taker, to a man, to a need.
And I won't go back, I never wanted to leave.
Just a slave to a taker, will we never be free?
In a city so callus, with two dead set eyes.
With a mouth full of xans and a handful of time.
They say what doesn't kill you will just keep you alive.
And what doesn't kill you...
In the place you love with all the dogs set free.
In a future together was never going to be me.
Just a slave to a taker, to a man, to a need.
And I can never go back, I never wanted to leave
In the city so callus with two dead set eyes.
With a mouth full of xans and a handful of time.
They say what doesn't kill you will just keep you alive.
And what doesn't kill you...
Always the long way home
In the city, so callus, with two dead set eyes.
With a mouth full of xans and a handful of time.
They say what doesn't kill you will just get high.
And what doesn't kill you...
