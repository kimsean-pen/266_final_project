Like a shotgun in a fist fight
Like a murder in the daylight
I'm the poison in the lead pipes
Open me up and watch the dogs fight
Dogs fight
My angel's in a headlock
And I'm dropping bombs from the rooftops
I ain't waiting on the world to wake up
Oh, you never need luck when you don't stop
Don't stop

My New Year's resolution, yeah
To choke out my illusions, yeah
To cut trough the confusion, yeah
Oh, keep on digging deep, keep digging deep
Keep digging deep, we keep digging

We don't stop, we don't stop
Yeah, we don't stop
Oh, keep on digging deep, keep digging deep
Keep digging

The ball drops
Start ticking to a new clock
Get back up and take another shot
Oh, pour the hard liquor and get up, get up, oh yeah

My New Year's resolution, yeah
Is to choke out my illusions, yeah
And cut trough the confusion, yeah
Oh, keep on digging deep, keep digging deep
Keep digging deep, keep digging

We don't stop, we don't stop
Yeah, we don't stop
Oh, keep on digging deep, keep digging deep
Keep digging

I give the side eye to the soundbites pumping stock lies
Saying shit don't stink
Touch a hot nerve when I prefer to be think first
And turn down Jonestown drinks
Five senses and a brain to move me
Five ways that they can never use me
I got the fire, I got control
I got the fire, I got control

Five senses and a brain to move me (Control!)
Five senses and a brain to move me (Control!)
Five senses and a brain to move me (Control!)

My New Year's resolution, yeah
To choke out my illusions, yeah
To cut trough the confusion, yeah
Oh, keep on digging deep, we keep digging deep
We keep digging deep, we keep digging
We keep digging, we keep digging
We keep digging, we keep digging
We keep digging, we keep digging

Yeah, we don't stop, we don't stop
Yeah, we don't stop
Oh, keep on digging deep, keep digging deep
Oh, keep on digging deep, keep digging deep
Oh, digging

I got the fire, I got the soul
I got the fire, I got the soul
I got the fire, I got the soul
I got the fire, I got the hahahayeah
