A prayer unheard
Followed a shift
In sound
A moment
And a chance
Can you hear it?
It's calling you
To bare
A weakness to the world
Have they answered
The prayers of home?

Mechanically they speak
Through rusty chords lost
Lost at sea
Unyielding tides
Weeping in hands
Carries on
A tribal woe

Release
Revolve
Renew

Did your voice cast shadows
Cast ash on skin
A wound that grew
From within
A rhythm and rhyme
Planting on borrowed time

Release
Revolve
Renew
Rebuild again

Yet this spore cast ash on skin
A wound that flows from within
A rhythm and a rhyme
Planting on borrowed time
