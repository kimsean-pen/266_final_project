In the winding down hours
I let your heart down again
(What did I do to make a scene so gory?)
(I'm no better than the ones before me)
Old habits die hard
I always end up hating the end
(What did I do to make a scene so gory?)
(I'm no better than the ones before me)

I'm in the middle of a breakdown
Watching you scream
In the middle of a breakdown
Screaming at me
And by the way
By the way
What made you think you'd have it your way?
And by the way
By the way
Don't say I didn't warn you
That I'll always stay the same

Speechless and frozen
Uncomfortable silence again
(What did I do to make a scene so gory?)
(I'm no better than the ones before me)
I'm in the middle of a breakdown
Watching you scream
In the middle of a breakdown
Screaming at me
And by the way
By the way
What made you think you'd have it your way?
And by the way
By the way
Don't say I didn't warn you
That I'll always stay the same

Battered and bruised
Broken confused
It's time we both knew
Can't stop what I started
This time we both lose, lose
And by the way
By the way
What made you think you'd have it your way
And by the way
By the way
Don't say I didn't warn you
That I'll always stay the same
The same, the same
I'll always stay the same
(battered and bruised)
The same, (broken confused), the same
I didn't warn you that I'd always stay the same
