I sold my soul
Just so I could feel paid
I broke my heart
So I couldn't feel pain
I've lost my faith
Cause I can't justify the weight
I've got no hope
That's only for losers and fakes

I'm nothing but a user and an abuser
You don't wanna know what's on my mind
I know I'm just a fool but I'm not fooling
Not afraid to make a fool out of my self

And fuck your money, fuck your fame
Fuck my life I walk away
And fuck I love, fuck I'm sorry
For everything I ever done

You can't save me
You better give your self to someone else
Fading, I'm just fallin' into my condition
Fading, you better put your time in something else
Save me but don't worry about it now
You better save your fucking self

I lost my mind
Just so I could escape
I still got time
But I know it's too late
I still got friends
To tell me I'm OK
I've still alive
But I keep on testin' fate

I'm nothing but a user and an abuser
You don't wanna know what's on my mind
I know I'm just a fool but I'm not fooling
Not afraid to make a fool out of my self

And fuck your money, fuck your fame
Fuck my life I walk away
And fuck I love, fuck I'm sorry
For everything I ever done

You can't save me
You better give your self to someone else
Fading, I'm just fallin' into my condition
Fading, you better put your time in something else
Save me but don't worry about it now
You better save your fucking self

Try just a little understand what I'm telling you
I'm not what you think I started off doing the right thing
Life got in the way, you don't know what to say
I'm not asking why

You can't save me
You better give your self to someone else
Fading, I'm just fallin' into my condition
Fading, you better put your time in something else
Save me but don't worry about it now
You better save your fucking self
