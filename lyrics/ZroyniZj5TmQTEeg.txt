Darlin', darlin', doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself, 'cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarmin', honestly, how charmin' she can be
Foolin' everyone, tellin' 'em she's havin' fun

She says, "You don't want to be like me"
"Don't wanna see all the things I've seen"
"I'm dyin', I'm dyin'"
She says, "You don't want to get this way"
"Famous and dumb at an early age"
"Lyin', I'm lyin'"

The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audio tune lies, she's still shinin'
Like lightnin', woah
White lightnin'

Carmen, Carmen, stayin' up till mornin'
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarmin', truly, how disarmin' you can be
Eatin' soft ice cream, Coney Island queen

She says, "You don't want to be like me"
"Lookin' for fun, gettin' high for free"
"I'm dyin', I'm dyin'"
She says, "You don't want to get this way"
"Street walk at night, and a star by day"
"It's tirin', tirin'"

The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audio tune lies, she's still shinin'
Like lightnin', woah
White lightnin'

Baby's all dressed up, with nowhere to go
That's the little story of the girl you know
Relyin' on the kindness of strangers
Tyin' cherry knots, smilin', doin' party favours
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
Sing your song, song, now the camera's on
And you're alive again

Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi
Tu as besoin de moi
Tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie
Tu ne peux vivre sans moi
Et je mourrais sans toi
Je tuerais pour toi

The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audio tune lies, she's still shinin'
Like lightnin', woah
White lightnin'

Like lightnin', woah
White lightnin'

Darlin', darlin', doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself, 'cause her liquor's top shelf
