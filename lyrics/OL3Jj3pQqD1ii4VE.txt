Bathing in moonlight
I shiver and I tremble
Captured by the spell
Awakening this temple
My eyes turn to white
And breathing is broken
Dark powers taking vessel
Of my human token

As clouds are veiling
The moon of first frost
I gather my senses
Regaining what was lost
The pact I had made
Is signed and concealed
My soul is now branded
My true face revealed

To you our Father
I renew my black oath
Christ and his sheep
I curse and I loath
My black devotion
Your Jesus i despise
With this sign I announce
His utter demise
