Evil kin
Is it a sin?
To be born out of love
Lethal code
In the blood
Heritance
To recall
The devil's lash
Around the neck
Winding up
To the left
Deception of our kind
In the blood of Jesus Christ

As the devil calls
They can't resist
Those people whose names are on his list
All shall praise
The evil kin
All shall praise
The evil kin

Evil kin
Is it a sin?
To exist
Or to breed
The genome
Belongs to all
An ingenious trap to fall
And the winner
Will be drawn
In a lottery
That pleases us all
And we just can't resist
Otherwise we won't exist

Hip hip hooray
Glory to the human race
Hip hip hooray
Glory to the human race

As the devil calls
They can't resist
Those people whose names are on his list
All shall praise
The evil kin
All shall praise
The evil kin
All shall praise
The evil kin
All shall praise
The evil kin
