Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm

I'm gonna ask you to look away
I love my hands but it hurts to pray
Life I have isn't what I'd seen
The sky's not blue and the field's not green

Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me

Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm

I'm gonna ask you to look away
A broken life will never stay
Tried too hard and I always lack
Days are gray and the nights are black

Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait

Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
