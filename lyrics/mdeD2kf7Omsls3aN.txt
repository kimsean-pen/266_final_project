You fall awake again
You're sleeping with your friends
You don't know where it ends
It's back to bed again
Love the void, my friend
You don't know where it ends
Your time will never stop
A tick tock on the big clock

I'll never, never let you go
Never want to see you alone
I never want you to go
Well, one day you'll die
But not tonight

Stop there, I won't let you
Drop dead in your bedroom
Moon child won't see another day
I'm finding God in hospitals
Wired things in wicked walls
Wake up, you'll be just fine
No, not this time

Back to sleep again
You're killing all your friends
Time will never stop
Tick tock on the big clock

I'll never, never let you go
Never want to see you alone
I never want you to go
Well one day you'll die
But not to-fucking-night!

Stop there, I won't let you
Drop dead in your bedroom
Moon child won't see another day
I'm finding God in hospitals
Wired things in wicked walls
Wake up, you'll be just fine
No, not this time

No, I won't say goodnight
No, I won't say goodnight
No, I won't say goodnight
No, no, no, no, no I won't say goodnight

Where will I be?
Floating down-stream
Humming along
To the loveliest dream
Where will I be?
Floating down-stream
Humming along
To the loveliest sleep

Stop there, I won't let you
Drop dead in your bedroom
Moon child won't see another day
I'm finding God in hospitals
Wired things in wicked walls
Wake up, you'll be just fine
No, not this time

No, I won't say goodnight
No, I won't say goodnight
Oh yeah
No, I won't say goodnight
Oh no, no, no, no, no
No, I won't say goodnight
