I could type down
Lucky number
Am I wrong to hinder?
I wanna dive down hard as you can
And lie as close to me

She'd be waiting with the light low
Am I wrong? I don't know
We could get a ride home
Would you care if I only dared to go?

When the lone nights are closing in
Did you need me go away?
With the dark days and pouring rain
In the cold light of day

Did your whole world come caving in
And you needed somewhere to stay
Did you need someone to
keep you on your toes
In the cold light of day

In love
She's got the Japanese girl
In love with a Chinese girl
In love
She's got the Japanese girl
In love with a Chinese girl

In love with the Japanese girls
In love with the Chinese girls
In love with the Japanese girls
In love with the Chinese girls
In love with the Japanese girls
In love with the Chinese girls
In love with the Japanese girls
In love with the Chinese girls
