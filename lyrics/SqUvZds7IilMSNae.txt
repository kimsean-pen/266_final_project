I think of you everyday
I just can't wait to send you plastic flowers
today I'll be far away
so I'll talk to you on the telephone
nevertheless I'm happy and sad
everyone knows me
everyone knows my name
and I know they do
they seem to like me too
everywhere I go they're smiling
and I know they do
I think about yesterday
when I heard you say, "his majesty is dreaming"
tomorrow as I awake
the beds will shake
whilst the palace walls are crumbling
nevertheless I'm happy and safe
everyone knows me
everyone knows my name
and I know they do
they seem to like me too
everywhere I go they're smiling
and I know they do
looking for the trace
the trace of my second face
yes I'm looking
I'm looking for something that no one else could bring
yes for something
nevertheless I'm happy and safe
everyone knows me
everyone knows my name
and I know they do
they seem to like me too
everywhere I go they know me
and I know they do
nevertheless I'm happy and safe
everyone knows me
everyone knows my name
and I know they do
