Goddess of the void
Goddess of the void
Goddess of the void
Goddess of the void

Down here in the pit
Where only blind eyes see
My compass is the heart
And sheer brutality

It's the primitive in man
That is taking control
In the season of the haythor
Reversal of the pole

Darling, your eyes were full of darkness
Now someone else holds what was mine
Darling, your womb gave birth to stars and light
Now there is hollowness inside and emptiness behind

Goddess of the void
Goddess of the void

Out here in the fields
Where only instincts dwell
On the quest to find my fellow
I'm sensating your smell

Through the forest of the coming
And the planes of the before
In the night of the apocalypse
We reunite the core

Darling, your eyes were full of darkness
Now someone else holds what was mine
Darling, your womb gave birth to stars and light
Now there is hollowness inside and emptiness behind

Goddess of the void
Goddess of the void

Through the forest of the coming
And the planes of the before
In the night of the apocalypse
We reunite the core

Through the forest of the coming
And the planes of the before
In the night of the apocalypse
We reunite, reunite the core

Darling, your eyes were full of darkness
Now someone else holds what was mine
Darling, your womb gave birth to stars and light
Now there is hollowness inside and emptiness behind

Darling, your eyes were full of darkness
Now someone else holds what was mine
Darling, your womb gave birth to stars and light
Now there is hollowness inside and emptiness behind

Goddess of the void
Goddess of the void.
