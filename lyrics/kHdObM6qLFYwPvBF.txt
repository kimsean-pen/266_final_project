Sweet love of mine
Why keep on breaking your back in two
Just to prove you're all right
Just give it up
Why keep on coming
When I only want to break your heart

You've lost your mind
Why aren't you able to just move on
And get a grip on your life
Quit holding on
To all the things that I've regretted
For far too long

You have got to realize what we've been through
And know we have only one life
And too little time
And I've wasted it all on you

Please please darling won't you leave me alone
I'm tired of living in this heartbreak home
I try and try and try
To get you out of my life
But I can't seem shake this vice

My lovesick valentine
Why keep on trying to tame this heart
When you know it's a lie

You're lost in your own self-demise
It's about time to open your eyes

And see yourself for what you are
I'm sick of being just another scar
That you carve into your pitch-black heart
I'm begging please won't you prove me wrong.

Please, please darling won't you leave me alone

Please, please darling won't you leave me alone
I'm tired of living in this heartbreak home
I try and try and try
To get you out of my life
But I can't seem shake this vice

Grip that you call true love
I can't believe I gave up everything you're like a drug
I try and try and try
To get out of my life
But I can't seem shake this vice
Leave my heart
I've fallen out of what you think we are
Please please darling won't you leave me alone
I'm tired of living in this heartbreak home
I try and try and try
To get you out of my mind
But I can't seem to shake this vice
But I can't seem to shake this vice
