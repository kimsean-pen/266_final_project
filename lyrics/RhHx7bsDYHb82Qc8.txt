I saw you, you saw me, you hid your fangs so well
I should have known better but it is hard to tell
In beauty the evil waiting for possession
Deep inside reflections just a glimpse away

Your faithful servants, they bow to you
Together they're breaking the broken

We were set free, what is to be?
When it's all said and done, what is left to really say?
To be one turn to none, now we are just yesterday

You speak in killing words, the kind that crush and kill
No mercy, your pleasure to taste the blood you bled
The chase has ended in denial of glory
To trap and add to your servant souls

Your faithful servants, they bow to you
Together they're breaking the broken

We were set free, what is to be?
When it's all said and done, what is left to really say?
