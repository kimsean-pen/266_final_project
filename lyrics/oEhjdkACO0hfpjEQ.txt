Oh, I want to know just how to love you
The jewel of California
Oh, I want to skip stones on your skin, boy
And drown me in your water

And my boy like a queen
Unlike one you've ever seen
He knows how to love me better
A hit of dopamine, higher than I've ever been
He knows how to love me better

'Cause you're safe like spring time
Short days, long nights, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you
'Cause you taste like Lucky Strikes
You drag, I light, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you
Tell me all the ways to love you
Tell me all the ways to love you

Oh, I wanna tip toe through your bliss, boy
Get lost the more I find ya
Oh, don't wanna miss a second of this, boy
Hold tight and love me longer

And my boy like a queen
Unlike one you've ever seen
He knows how to love me better
(He knows how to love me better)
A hit of dopamine
Higher than I've ever been
He knows how to love me better

'Cause you're safe like spring time
Short days, long nights, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you
(Tell me all the ways to love you)
'Cause you taste like Lucky Strikes
You drag, I light, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you
(Tell me all the ways to love you)
Tell me all the ways to love you
Tell me all the ways to love you
Tell me all the ways to love you
Tell me all the ways to love you

Breathe me in, exhale slow
Take me to anywhere you wanna go
Breathe me in, exhale slow
Take me to anywhere you wanna go

'Cause you're safe like spring time
Short days, long nights, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you
(Tell me all the ways to love you)
'Cause you taste like Lucky Strikes
You drag, I light, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you
(Tell me all the ways to love you)
Tell me all the ways to love you
(Tell me all the ways to love you)
Tell me all the ways to love you
Tell me all the ways
(Tell me all the ways to love you)
Tell me all the ways
(Tell me all the ways to love you)
(Tell me all the ways to love you)
(Tell me all the ways to love you)
