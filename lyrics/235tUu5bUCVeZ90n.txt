Time it tells, living in my hometown
Wedding bells, they begin easy
Live it down, baby don't talk that much
Baby knows but baby don't tease me
In the park, we could go walking
Drown in the dark, but we could go sailing on the sea

Always here, always on time
Close call, was it love or was it just easy?
Money talks when people need shoes and socks
Steady boys, I'm thinking she needs me

I was just sipping on something sweet
I don't need political process
I got this feeling that they're gonna break down the door
I got this feeling that they're gonna come back for more
See, I was thinking that I lost my mind
But it's been getting to me all this time
And they don't stop dragging me down

Silently, reflection turns my world to stone
Patiently, correction leaves us all alone
And sometimes I'm a travel man but tonight this engine's failing
And I still hear the children playing

Kick the can, kick the can,
Skip and black jack, steal a car and ring a round-Rosey
Rock and roll, candyland,
Boogieman, run away and give me your sneakers

Acid rain, when Abel looked up at Cain
We began the weeping and wailing
A hurried high from pestilence, pills and pride
It's a shame, we could have gone sailing
But Heaven knows, heaven knows everything
Tranquilize

I got this feeling that they're gonna break down the door
I got this feeling that they're gonna come back for more
See, I was thinking that I lost my mind
But it's been getting to me all this time
And it don't stop dragging me down

Silently, reflection turns my world to stone
Patiently, correction leaves us all alone
And sometimes I'm a travel man
But tonight, this engine's failing

And I still hear the children playing
Dead beat dancers come to us and stay

'Cause I don't care where you've been
And I don't care what you've seen
We're the ones who still believe
And we're looking for a page
In that lifeless book of hope
Where a dream might help you cope
Where the Bushes and the bombs
Uh huh, tranquilize
