May this be your victory song
A song for you when I am gone
Reminding you of what you're meant to be
A gift to bring you clarity
To show you that your destiny
Is not defined by what you've failed to see, no
May this lift you up
When you feel you'll fall again
You cannot win
Hope these words are enough for you to be strong my friend
Sometimes you fall before you ride
Sometimes you lose it all to find
You've gotta keep fighting and get back up again
My champion
Oh my champion
You've lost so many times it hurts
But failures made are lessons learned
Cause in the end what you are will be much more than you were.
May this lift you up
When you feel you'll fall again
You cannot win
Hope these words are enough for you to be strong my friend
Sometimes you fall before you ride
Sometimes you lose it all to find
You've gotta keep fighting and get back up again
My champion
Oh my champion
Don't ever run away
For every fear you face
You will survive and be much more than you were
Sometimes you fall before you ride
Sometimes you lose it all to find
You've gotta keep fighting and get back up again
The world's gonna try and knock you out
Just pick yourself up when you go down
You've gotta keep fighting and get back up again
My champion
Oh my champion
My champion
My champion
