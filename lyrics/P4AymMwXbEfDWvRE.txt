These hands
Like strangers in the wind
These eyes
Float in the breeze
These hands
Like strangers in the wind
This voice
Calling to me
These hands
Like strangers in the wind
These eyes
Float in the breeze

Run to the lights of the city
These moments pass and we'll be there
(And she looks good)
Run to the lights of the city
(And she looks good)
This dance will last us forever
Forever

(You could stay for what you came here for
A daze is what you're falling for
You could stay for what you came here for
A daze is what you're falling for
You could stay for what you came here for
A daze is what you're falling for
You could stay for what you came here for
A daze is what you're falling for)

Run to the lights of the city
These moments pass and we'll be there
(And she looks good)
Run to the lights of the city
(And she looks good)
This dance will last us forever
Forever

This dance will last us forever
This dance will last us forever
