I stick on a best coast record,
Sit outside in the sun.
pull a chair next to you,
Say that you are the one.
You showed me joy division,
You showed me dead man's bones.
Just a summer romance,
Look how far we've grown.
It won't always be summer,
It might be autumn too
Then winter might come join in,
But I'll be next to you.
Cause you are my little star.
I said you are my little star.
I said you are my light in the dark.
Don't change,
Just be who you are.
Just be who you are.
Just be who you are.
