Oh darling
I wanted to be everything to you
You are everything
Oh you are everything

Today I saw somebody who looked just like you
He walked like you do, I thought it was you
As he turned the corner, I called out your name
I felt so ashamed, when it wasn't you, wasn't you

You are everything and everything is you
Oh, you are everything and everything is you
Oh, you are everything and everything is you

Oh babe, how can I forget when each face that I see
Brings back memories of being with you
Oh oh darling, I just can't go on living life as I do
Comparing each girl with you, knowing they just won't do
They're not you, no, no baby

You are everything and everything is you
Oh, you are everything and everything is you
Oh, you are everything and everything is you
Everything, honey everything, everything, baby

Honey everything is you
Woman you, you are everything I think
Everything, darling everything is you
Baby you, you're everything, everything woman
Oh baby everything is you
You are everything and everything is you
Oh, you are everything and everything is you
