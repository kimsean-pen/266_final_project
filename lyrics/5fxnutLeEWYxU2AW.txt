I'm loving your story
No one does it quite like you
Taking your clothes off
You don't give a fuck who's watching you
Give me attention
I wanna be the one that you call
for sex and dim-sum
Ooo baby we can make it pour
Oh, we can, pour on me, alright
Imma pour it on his back
Oh my, oh my, he's risky
Oh my, oh my, getting dizzy
Oh my, oh my, he's trippy
I wanna have some of that
Oh my, oh my, drinking whiskey
Oh my, oh my, getting tipsy
Oh my, oh my, he's sexy
I wanna have some of that
Making movies
Messing up the couch
Love how you're moving
What you're doing im all about
It's like a reflex
When i get drunk i gotta fuck
You say I'm sleepless
I say I'm going to pour it up
Ohh, oh, we can pour it on me, alright
Imma pour it on his back
Oh my, oh my, he's risky
Oh my, oh my, getting dizzy
Oh my, oh my, he's trippy
I wanna have some of that
Oh my, oh my, drinking whiskey
Oh my, oh my, getting tipsy
Oh my, oh my, he's sexy
I wanna have some of that
Gotta have you as my man
Pay my penance any way i can
Ohh, gotta let me love you right
Promise imma never close my eyes
Oh my, oh my, he's risky
Oh my, oh my, getting dizzy
Oh my, oh my, he's trippy
I wanna have some of that
Oh my, oh my, drinking whiskey
Oh my, oh my, getting tipsy
Oh my, oh my, he's sexy
I wanna have some of that
