SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
I'm about to br-
Wasn't that fun? Let's try something else

45 calibre killer from out of the filler

Definitely going to show y'all brothers how you not a gorilla
Smooth talking, fully automatic weapon concealer
Taste thriller, break thriller
Let's hit 'em with the bounce filler
Filthy stinking, standing on solid ground
And still be sinking, submerging in the parks
Still be linking, plucked beef when it starts
To fuck your thinking, it's not a mirage
I'm in the motherfucking track, yo, from out the garage
Well if you could duck but it's hard to dodge
In the back of that spine where my darkness lies
Flippin' straight up ripping apart your squad
X-Ecutioner style cuts and blends like a syringe
Hanging you from each of your limbs
See me coming through the party hard
Without no body guard
Smoking something, stomping on each of you Tims
I'm the B-to-the-L to A to C king
And when it comes to planning
The thought to keep thinking, man

SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
