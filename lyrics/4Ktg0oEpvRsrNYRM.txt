Love is such a novelty
A rarely painted masterpiece
A place few people go or ever know

An underwater rocket love
Exactly what I'm searching for
You're brave enough to go
Tell me so

Say you'll go to Nirvana
Will you leave Samsara?
In the words of Dhammapada
"Who will lead? Who will follow?"

Our love will sail in this ark
The world could end outside our window
Let's find forever
And write our name in fire on each others' hearts

Love is not a fantasy
A haiku written in Japanese
A word too often used but not believed

Witness the interaction of
The flood, the sea, the sky, the dove
Time erodes the shore but not our love

Say you'll go to Nirvana
Will you leave Samsara?
Or in the words of Dhammapada
"Who will lead? Who will follow?"

Our love will sail in this ark
The world could end outside our window
Let's find forever
And write our name in fire on each others' hearts

Doot-doo-doo, doo-doot doot-doo
Doot-doot-doo, doo-doot-doot doo-doo
Doot-doo-doo, doo-doot doot-doo,
Doot-doot-doo, do-doot-doot doo-doo

Our love will sail in this ark
The world could end outside our window
Let's find forever
And write our name in fire on each others' hearts

Our love will sail in this ark
The world could end today (outside our window)
We'll find a way
(Let's find forever)
Name in fire on each others' hearts
Hearts

Doot-doo-doo, doo-doot doot-doo
The world could end today
Doot-doot-doo, doo-doot-doot doo doo

Our love will sail in this ark
The world could end outside our window
We'll find forever
Hmm

Oooh, oooh

Love is not a fantasy
It's more for you
You and me

(Ahh, ahh, ooh
You're on your way
More now than any knew
Oooh, will you go or stay and play?
Oooh)
