Well there's a black man with a black cat
Livin' in a black neighborhood
He's got an interstate runnin' through his front yard
You know he thinks he's got it so good
And there's a woman in the kitchen
Cleanin' up the evenin' slop
And he looks at her and says hey darlin'
I can remember when you could
Stop a clock

Aw, but ain't that America for you and me
Ain't that America somethin' to see, baby
Ain't that America home of the free, yeah
Little pink houses for you and me
Oh yeah, for you and me, oh

Well, there's a young man in a t-shirt
Listenin' to a rockin' rollin' station
He's got his greasy hair, greasy smile
He says Lord this must be my destination
'Cause they told me when I was younger
Said boy, you're gonna be president
But just like everything else those old crazy dreams
Kinda came and went

Oh, but ain't that America for you and me
Ain't that America somethin' to see, baby
Ain't that America home of the free, yeah
Little pink houses for you and me
Oh, little baby for you and me

(Ohh, ohh, ohh)
(Ohh, ohh, ohh, oh yea)
Well, there's people and more people
What do they know-know-know
Go to work in some high rise
And vacation down at the Gulf of Mexico, ooh yeah
And there's winners and there's losers
But they ain't no big deal
'Cause the simple man, baby
Pays for thrills, with bills, with pills that kill

Aw, but ain't that America for you and me
Ain't that America somethin' to see, baby
Ain't that America home of the free, yeah
Little pink houses for you and me, ooh
Ooh yeah

Ain't that America for you and me
Ain't that America hey we're somethin' to see, baby
(Ain't that America) Oh the home of the free
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Little pink houses, babe, for you and me
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
