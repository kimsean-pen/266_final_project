So I know you're lonely, you think that you're the only one
Baby, listen close, let me be your number one
The city's getting colder, the streets are turning into hights
So baby, hold me close, let me stay for one more night

Nothing's grab the same, european Vegas
Nothing's grab the same, european Vegas

So baby, take my hand walking down the ending view
I know you're the one (?), I guess there's nothing left to do
So come on (?) dreamer, do I got the mess to play?
The city is in sober, wake you with your loving bed

Nothing's grab the same, european Vegas
Nothing's grab the same, european Vegas

Nothing's grab the same, european Vegas
Nothing's grab the same, european Vegas
Nothing's grab the same, european Vegas
Nothing's grab the same, european Vegas
