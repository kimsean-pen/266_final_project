So there goes my life
Passing by with every exit sign
It's been so long
Sometimes I wonder how I will stay strong
No sleep tonight
I'll keep on driving these dark highway lines
And as the moon fades
One more night gone, only twenty more days

But I will see you again
I will see you again a long time from now

And there goes my life
Passing by with every departing flight
And its been so hard
So much time so far apart
And she walks the night
How many hearts will die tonight
And when things have changed
I guess I'll find out in seventeen days

But I will see you again
I will see you again a long time from now

My body aches
And it hurts to say
No one is moving
And I wish that I weren't here tonight
But this is my life.

And I will see you again
I will see you again a long time from now

And I will see you again
I will see you again a long time from now
