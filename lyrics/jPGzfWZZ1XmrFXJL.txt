It's the place that he takes you
Under the floor
Don't let him change you
An open home for those who stray
Twice it rang out
I can see his face

At least we're not alone

It's the place that he takes you
Under the floor
Don't let him erase you
An open grave for those who stray
I'm beside you
I can see your face

At least we're not alone
