Take care
Lift the guard and you might find
Your place in that life
A place where you found hope
There's nothing more than the fog from the dry ice burning
Corpses turning
Take care
Lift the guard you won't be lonely
Too much longer
Too much longer
Raise your crippled hand into the clouds and
Wave bye bye now
Wave bye bye bye
Raise your hands around and you can't tell it's the last thing you'll see
Last thing you'll play
Hopeless when you call "Hi! Hi."
What is it you're after? don't just stand there
Oh...
Oh
