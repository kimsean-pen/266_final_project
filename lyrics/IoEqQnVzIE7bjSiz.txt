I woke real tired with the earth for a bed
Can't remember nothing but the colors black and red (black and red)
Black and red (black and red)
Well, a little bit of fun never hurt no one
Now I need shelter from the raging desert sun (desert sun)
Desert sun (desert sun)
Dragging my bones to the side of the road
Pounding in my head so loud it could explode (could explode)
It could explode

I'm heading on back to Reno
Heading on back to Reno
All the way, all the way
'Cause I'm heading on back to Reno
Heading on back to Reno
Everyday, get away
I'm heading on back to Reno
Heading on back to Reno
And I say yeah, uh

Escaping into vice in the city in the sand
What if your way is right back in my hand (in my hand)
It's in my hand (in my hand)
Lost a lot of time in the land of the drought
Chasing down a fever that I could not live without (live without)
Couldn't live without (live without)
Desert's gotten cold in the dark of the night
Looking to the distance I can see a bitter light
Is it light?

I'm heading on back to Reno
Heading on back to Reno
All the way, all the way
'Cause I'm heading on back to Reno
Heading on back to Reno
Everyday, get away
I'm heading on back to Reno
Heading on back to Reno
And I say yeah, uh
