Couldve run
Aint that enough?

Feel alive
Out on a limb
Same way as up

I want to be where we as people should be
I want to see whats that sound

Couldve won, shouldve lost
And lay down and sung.
Change your mind, change your line
Under my tongue

I wanna go where we as people should go
And I wanna know what goes on

I want to see whats that sound
Make it home
