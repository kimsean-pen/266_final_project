Got to regret right now (I'm feeling this)
The air is so cold and low (I'm feeling this)
Let me go in her room (I'm feeling this)
I wanna take off her clothes (I'm feeling this)
Show me the way to bed (I'm feeling this)
Show me the way you move (I'm feeling this)
Fucking it it's such a blur (I'm feeling this)
I love all the things you do (I'm feeling this)

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine (Place your hand in mine)
I'll leave when I wanna (I'll leave when I wanna)

Where do we go from here
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feeling this)
My breathing has got too loud (I'm feeling this)
Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feeling this)
Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feeling this)
We're taking this way too slow (I'm feeling this)
Take me away from here (I'm feeling this)

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine (Place your hand in mine)
I'll leave when I wanna (I'll leave when I wanna)

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

This place was never the same again after you came and went
How can you say you meant anything different
To anyone standing alone on the street
With a cigarette on the first night we met

Look to the past and remember and smile
And maybe tonight I can breathe for awhile
I'm not in the scene I think I'm falling asleep
But then all that it means is I'll always be dreaming of you

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

Fate fell short this time (Fate fell short this time)
Your smile fades in the summer (Your smile fades in the summer)
Place your hand in mine (Place your hand in mine)
I'll leave when I wanna (I'll leave when I wanna)

Fate fell short this time (Fate fell short this time)
Your smile fades in the summer
(Your smile fades in the summer)(So I'll stand to face the illusion)
Place your hand in mine (Place your hand in mine)
I'll leave when I wanna (I'll leave when I wanna)
(So I'll stand to face the illusion)

Fate fell short this time (Fate fell short this time)
I'm your own, you feel it)
Your smile fades in the summer
(Your smile fades in the summer)
(So I'll stand to face the illusion)
Place your hand in mine (Place your hand in mine)
(I'm your own, you feel it)
I'll leave when I wanna (I'll leave when I wanna)
(So I'll stand to face the illusion)

Fate fell short this time
(Fate fell short this time)
(I'm your own, you feel it)
Your smile fades in the summer
(Your smile fades in the summer)
(So I'll stand to face the illusion)
Place your hand in mine (Place your hand in mine)
(I'm your own, you feel it)
I'll leave when I wanna (I'll leave when I wanna)
So I'll stand to face the illusion)
