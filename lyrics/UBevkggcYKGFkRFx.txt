It's alright
there comes a time
got no patience to search
for peace of mind

Layin' low
want to take it slow
no more hiding or
disguising truths I've sold

Everyday it's something
hits me all so cold
find me sittin' by myself
no excuses, that I know

It's okay
had a bad day
hands are bruised from
breaking rocks all day

Drained and blue
I bleed for you
you think it's funny, well
you're drowning in it too

Everyday it's something
hits me all so cold
find me sittin' by myself
no excuses, that I know

Yeah, it's fine
we'll walk down the line
leave our rain,
a cold trade for warm sunshine

You my friend
I will defend
and if we change, well
I love you anyway

Everyday it's something
hits me all so cold
find me sittin' by myself
no excuses, that I know
