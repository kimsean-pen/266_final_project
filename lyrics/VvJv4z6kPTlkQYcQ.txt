Sinking through stone
Reasons for being come so slowly
Placing to show
Planned obsolescence embryos

Roaming free with depravity
Holding hands with a hollow man
Some kind of new manipulation

Charm and betray
Ruin and replay
Seduce and deceive
Destroy and repeat

Trading lives for existences
A screen door to a warmer war
It always ends with a flare inside a sphere
And everything's clear

Please don't remember me
Like I'll always remember you
Please don't remember me
Like I'll always remember you
