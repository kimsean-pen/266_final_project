Hey wait, cough count keep me awake
Low key, happy and harmless it's so un-alarming
I can feel it coming out of your AC vents
And it just wears me out, oh it just wears me out

You'll get nothing and like it, you'll learn to be quiet
It's a wonderful way to behave in the company of someone you can't tolerate
Hold on, I said it like thirty times in a row
And it just wears me out, oh it just wears me out

And it just wears me out, oh it just wears me out
