You're running out now
You've led them through your tired edge again
They know you're mourning now
Your every selfish loss was an excuse to up your gain

Bring down the walls
On yourself
On yourself

Rise up and question now
I'm just suprised your vision is so set in doubt
And I know... I am so over now
Too used to being buried in a shallow light
Gone blind
But the damage is done
And I've left their sky
Too overwhelmed in this light
And I've just realized they're right
I just can't handle this life

Just leave me inside and let me say (to myself):

"In your light hangs a suicide,
And I wish you cared"

But you brought down the walls
On yourself
On yourself
