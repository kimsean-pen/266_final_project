You're always such a fool
and in your eyes so blue
I see the life I never had before.

Do you remember when
we used to live things separate
we hadn't met or thought
that could be possible.

I'm glad you had your life
so good to listen to your past
all of those things brought you
with me and now we're two.

You're always such a fool
and in your eyes so blue
I see the life I never had before.
You always talk so smooth
and in your voice, so true
I hear the dream
I never had before.

But if I try to think
of something better than this
heaven comes down
and reminds the luck we live.

You're always such a fool
and in your eyes so blue
I see the life I never had before.
You always talk so smooth
and in your voice, so true
I hear the dream
I never had before.
