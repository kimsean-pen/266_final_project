Burn bright through the night, two pockets lead the way.
Two doors to go between, the wall was raised today.
Two doors, two names to call your other and your own.
Keep these books well stocked away and take your happy home.

My carpenter's out and running about and talking to the street.
My pockets are out and running about and barking in the street,
to tell what I have hidden there.

Burn bright through the night, two pockets lead the way.
Two doors to go between, the wall was raised today.
Raise the walls to hide these flaws, the carpenter should rest.
So that when you tire of one side the other serves you best.

My carpenter's out and running about, talking to the street.
My pockets are out and running about and barking in the street,
to tell what I have hidden there.

The hills ringing hear the words in time, listen to the holler...
Listen to my walls within my tongue.
Can't you see you made my ears go tin
The air quicken tension building inference suddenly.
Life and how to live it.

Raise the walls to hide these flaws, the carpenter should rest.
So that when you tire of one side the other serves you best.
Read about the wisdom wall, the knock-knock-knock.
A secret knock, one hammer's locked, the other wisdom's lost.

My carpenter's out and running about and talking to the street.
My pockets are out and running about and barking in the street,
to tell what I have hidden there.

My carpenter's out and running about, walking the...
Listen to the holler.
My pockets are out and running about, barking in the street,
to tell what I have hidden there.

Listen, listen to the holler.
If I write a book it will be called:
Life and how to live it.
