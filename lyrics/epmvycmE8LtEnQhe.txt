When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head
I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream

Stay in bed
Float up stream (float up stream)

Please, don't wake me
No, don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping

Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind

I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed

'Til they find
There's no need (there's no need)

Please, don't spoil my day
I'm miles away

& after all, I'm only sleeping

Keeping an eye
On the world going by my window

Taking my time
Lying there & staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling
Please, don't spoil my day

I'm miles away
& after all, I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye
On the world going by my window
Taking my time
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head
I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed
Float up stream (float up stream)
Please, don't wake me
No, don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping
