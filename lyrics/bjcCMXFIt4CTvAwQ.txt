As I walk away, I look over my shoulder
To see what I'm leaving behind
Pieces of puzzles and wishes on eyelashes fail

Ohh, how do I show all the love
Inside my heart?

Well, this is all new
And I'm feeling my way through the dark

And I used to talk with honest conviction
Of how I predicted my word
I'm gonna leave it to star gazers
Tell me what your telescope says

Ohh, what is in store for me now?
It's coming apart

I know that it's true
'Cause I'm feeling my way through the dark

Try to find a light on somewhere
Try to find a light on somewhere
I'm finding I'm falling in love with the dark, oh yeah

Ohh oh, what do I know?
I don't care where I start

For my troubles are few
As I'm feeling my way through the dark
Through the dark
I'm feeling my way through the dark
