So I'm waiting by a phone
For the blessed ring

Like a holy grail
for a fisher king
Time is ticking down
like a metronome
Rhythm for my brain
and its ceaseless scares

I never seem to play them
to the beat I hear
Though my heart beat is a beat
that beats so near
So we had a talk last night
About the heavy blow that

you dealt in fight
Your back against the wall
It was a puzzle piece
important to the whole that I may not find
You placed within the hole
I never seem to put them in the gaps I see
like a puzzle where the

pieces lost you and me
So Im changing who I am
'cos what I am's not good
And I know you love me now
But I don't see why you should

and I don't see why you should
No I don't see why you should
So I drift into the end
like a moth to light
Down the boulevard to a coffee shop
In the land of song
In the land of wait
Beat is bearing down on this lonely town
I never seem to write them
down as good as you
Like I some where lost the
keys that let me in
So I'm changing who I am
'cos what I am's not good
And I know you love me now
But I don't see why you should
So i'm changing who I am
'cos what i am's not good
and I know you love me now
Though I don't see why you should
and I don't see why you should
No I don't see why you should
