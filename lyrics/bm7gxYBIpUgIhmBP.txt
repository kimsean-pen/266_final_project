Alright
Toy green

Yeah, (Yeah, Yeah)
I was right all along,
Yeah, (Yeah, Yeah)
You come tagging along,
Exhibit A: On a tray, what you say,
Ends up thrown in your face
Exhibit B: What you see? Well that's me,
I'll put you back in your place

Yeah I've done it before,
And I can do it some more,
So what you waiting for?
Yeah! (Yeah, Yeah)
I was right all along!

'Cause I have done it before,
And I can do it some more,
I've got my eye on the score,
I'm gonna cut though the door,
It's too late, it's too soon, or is it...

Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Boom!

Ha

Oh Yeah, (Yeah, Yeah)
I was right you were wrong,
Yeah, (Yeah, Yeah)
Going, going, you're gone!
I saw you hesitating, waiting too much,
Until it slipped through your hands,
And then you stagger to your feet and out the door,
'Cause there's no second chance!

That's right

'Cause I have done it before,
And I can do it some more,
I've got my eye on the score,
I'm gonna cut though the door,
It's too late, it's too soon, or is it...

Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Boom!

Shake it

And you come crying to me...
But it's too late!
The man you've try hard to be,
But it's too late!
Get your head out the sand,
But it's too late...

It's too late,
Too late
Too late
Too late!

Yea
Oh
Oh

Oh Yeah!
But it's too late!
Yeah!
But it's too late!

You get your head out the sand,
But it's too late!
It's too late, too late,

You know I've done it before,
And I can do it some more,
I've got my eye on the score,
I'm gonna cut to the door,
You know I've done it before,
And I can do it some more,
I've got my eye on the score,
I'm gonna cut to the door,
It's too late, it's too soon,
It's too late, it's too soon,
It's too late, it's too soon, or is it...

Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick
BOOM!
