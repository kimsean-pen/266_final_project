Upside down
Under this starlit sky
Spring time
Pulling back a memory of ecstasy
We were breathing deep
Dust blow in my eyes early morning
The sun... starts to show
Driving out to the east coast
Towards the lights in the north

Upside down
Watching you defy gravity
Sixty nine
Under the light
Of a summer night

Upside down
Under this starlit sky
