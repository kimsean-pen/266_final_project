People fell it
People bump it
People rock it

Let's go get funky

Run to the door
Jump up on the floor
People party people
Come on and work the floor
I know what you're living for
People party people
Come on and work the floor

Hip shakin'
Body quakin'
Booties pumping
Let me see you sweat
Let me see you work it (say it)
Hip shakin'
Body quakin'
Booties pumping
Let me see you sweat
C'mon!!! loco, loco, loco

Las manos arriba
I know you're not tired
Honey, we're just gettin' started
What we need is a party in this place
We need to turn up the heat honey
We wanna rock this place
Are you ready to turn it up another notch?
I said, are you ready to turn it up another notch?
Come on, come on
Las manos arriba
Mueve lo

Arriba
Oh yeah! it's hot up in here
It's going to get ugly in a minute
Cause these children ain't playin'

Put your body to it
Put your hips to it
Put your shoulder to it
Put your leg to it
Don't forget your head

Let's go get funky!
Your body, your mind, your leg,
Your hips, your shoulder
Don't forget about your head

Everybody in the house
I wanna see you work up a sweat
If the person next to you don't have a sweat
Hit the door
