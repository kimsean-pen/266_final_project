We're like rivers in the night
I go left and you go right
We'll find on the other side
Who we are, who we are

Wish me luck and give me hope
Give me sunlight to my day
And turn it into gold
Carry on, carry on

We'll take these broken souls
Make them as good as new
Bind it together into something we could never loose

We're rivers in the night
I go left and you go right
We'll find on the other side
Who we are, who we are

We can make it
Into something beautiful, oh-oh
Yeah, we don't have to try
We can make it
Into something wonderful, oh-oh
We'll never say goodbye

We can make it
Into something beautiful, oh-oh
Yeah, we don't have to try
We can make it
Into something wonderful, oh-oh
We'll never say goodbye

Beautiful, oh-oh
Yeah, we don't have to try
Wonderful, oh-oh
We'll never say goodbye

We're like rivers in the night
I go left and you go right
We'll find on the other side
Who we are, who we are

Wish me luck and give me hope
Give me sunlight to my day
Turn it into gold
Carry on, carry on

We'll take these broken souls
Make them as good as new
Bind it together into something we could never loose

We're rivers in the night
I go left and you go right
We'll find out on the other side
Who we are, who we are

We can make it
Into something beautiful, oh-oh
Yeah, we don't have to try
We can make it
Into something wonderful, oh-oh
We'll never say goodbye

We can make it
Into something beautiful, oh-oh
Yeah, we don't have to try
We can make it
Into something wonderful, oh-oh
We'll never say goodbye
