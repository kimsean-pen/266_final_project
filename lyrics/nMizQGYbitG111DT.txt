C'mon, lost souls
Souls, souls
C'mon, lost souls
Ah-ooo
It's you, and you
And you, and you
And you, and you
And you, and you

Why am I here? Who could I be?
Could I be the hero? Could I be the villian? Trying to be productive, trying to make a living
Inside this world, somehow I do
Looking at the glass, ceiling reminiscing, pistol in my hand, hatred in my heart
I'm sorry for, painting that view
View of violence, into your subconscious, what the TV does too
I mean who could you blame?
I mean who could you blame?
Cause we're
Ooh-oohhh

Trapped in the vine
Feel left behind
Moon walking for, what you losing your mind?
You're losing your mind

C'mon, lost souls
Souls, souls
C'mon, lost souls
Ah-ooo
It's you, and you
And you, and you
And you, and you
And you, and you
