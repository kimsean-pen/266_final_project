The first man I killed was the earl's right hand man
When he came to take her away
I ran his own sword straight through his throat
And then I stood there, watching him fade
The first blood I spilled was the blood of a varg
I had to wipe his smile away
I was not yet a man
Nor was I a boy
But still I made that bastard pay

So I left him there
On the stable floor
Bathing in a pool of his own blood
My one and only choice was to flee this land
To leave this wretched place for good

I am an outcast
All alone
I'm a nomad without home
I am an outlaw
I'm disowned
And I am no man's son

Through the cold midwinter night on a southbound winding path
The stars and moon my only light, and the earl's men closing fast
I swore that I'd return
That I would see them burn
I relive it in my dreams
The smell, the blood, his dying screams

To my father I was dead
He took his hand from me
He drove me away, I was shunned
My one and only choice was to leave this land
To become the prey that they would hunt

I am an outcast
All alone
I'm a nomad without home
I am an outlaw
I'm disowned
And I am no man's son
I am an outcast
All alone
I'm a nomad without home
I am an outlaw
I'm disowned
And I am no man's son
