It's raining outside again
The flood gate's overwhelmed
There's no accounting for this mess
Of a mind or the damage we have done

All I know is that I'm sick
Of the weather (it's raining outside again)
The persistence helping at my pain
My shelter, for the [?] I have to remind this

What can I do? (Seasons change)
I hate myself for losing you
What can I say? (Seasons change)
When it's too late for me
I'm not like you
I shatter easy far from bulletproof
What can I do? (Seasons change)
I hate myself for losing you

(I hate myself for losing you)
(I hate myself for losing you)

Our landscape changed but I stayed the same
My stubborn roots are firmly in place
Phrasing limbs left forgotten, embrace the water springs
[?] the land that they gave

All I know is that I'm sick
Of the weather (I've been trying to recapture a feeling)
The persistence helping at my pain
The wind blows [?]

What can I do? (Seasons change)
I hate myself for losing you
What can I say? (Seasons change)
When it's too late for me
I'm not like you
I shatter easy far from bulletproof
What can I do? (Seasons change)
I hate myself for losing you

Maybe it's time that I embrace this change
Find some relief in the November rain
Think it's time to let go of all this pain
Let the flood waters come, wash away

Come and wash away

What can I do? (Seasons change)
I hate myself for losing you
What can I say? (Seasons change)
When it's too late for me
I'm not like you
I shatter easy far from bulletproof
What can I do? (Seasons change)
I hate myself for losing you

(I hate myself for losing you)
(I hate myself for losing you)
