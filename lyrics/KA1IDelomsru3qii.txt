Inane conversations
Suffocating
All this endless noise is so stifling
Fantasize of other lives
I think about it all the time
I dream about the other side
I think about it all the time
I'm out of my mind
If I can't keep up I'll just get left behind
Get out of my head
I'm running away
From things that don't make sense

Going through the motion
Day after day
Caught up in this phase
Can't seem to get away
Fantasize of other lives
I think about it all the time
I dream about the other side
I think about it all the time

I'm out of my mind
If I can't keep up I'll just get left behind
Get out of my head
I'm running away
From things that don't make sense

I'm out of my mind
If I can't keep up
I'll just get left behind
Get out of my head
I'm running away
From things that don't make sense
I'm out of my mind
I can't keep up I'll just get left behind
Get out of my head
I'm running away
From things that don't make sense
