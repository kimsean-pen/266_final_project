Ooh, you make me lay down
Ooh, you make me forget I am here
Ooh, you're making me safe now
Ooh, you make the faces disappear

I'm alright, by the way
Everyone saves the day
Sometimes I feel it

Send it up
Ah, send it up now
Send it up

Send it up
Ah, send it up now
Send it up

Ooh, I feel so close now
Ooh, you're taking me back from where I've been
Ooh, I'm not alone now
Ooh, you rest me up and rush me in

I'm alright, by the way
Everyone saves the day
Sometimes I feel it

Send it up
Ah, send it up now
Send it up
Send it up to me

Send it up
Ah, send it up now
Send it up

I'm alright, by the way
Everyone saves the day
Sometimes I feel it

Send it up
Ah, send it up now
Send it up
Send it up to me

Send it up
Ah, send it up now
Send it up
Send it up to me

Send it up
Ah, send it up now
Send it up, it up now

Send it up
Ah, send it up now
Send it up now, now
All it up to you
