Much as you blame yourself
You can't repent for the way that you feel
Had no example of a love that was even remotely real
How can you understand something that you never had?
Ooh baby, if you let me, I can help you out with all of that

Girl let me love you, and I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you, I know your trouble
Don't be afraid, girl let me help

Girl let me love you and I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
A heart of numbness is brought to life
I'll take you there

Hey,
Girl let me love you
Girl let me love you baby
Girl let me love you
Girl let me love you baby
Girl let me love you
Let me love you, let me love you

I can see the pain behind your eyes
It's been there for quite a while
I just wanna be the one to remind you what it is to smile, yeah
I would like to show you what true love can really do

Girl let me love you and I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you, I know your trouble
Don't be afraid, girl let me help

Girl let me love you and I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you,
A heart of numbness, is brought to life
I'll take you there

Girl let me love you baby
Girl let me love you
Let me love you, girl let me love you baby
Girl let me love you
Girl let me love you baby
Girl let me love you
Let me love you, girl let me love you baby

For every heart that beats
For every heart that beats
For every heart that beats
For every heart that beats
Heart that beats
Heart that beats
Heart that beats
Heart that beats

Girl let me love you and I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you, I know your trouble
Don't be afraid, girl let me help

Girl let me love you and I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
A heart of numbness, is brought to life
I'll take you there

Girl let me love you

Said let me love you baby, love you baby
Girl let me love you
Let me love you babe, love you babe, ooh-ooh-ah
