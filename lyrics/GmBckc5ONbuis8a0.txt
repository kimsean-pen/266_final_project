I know just what you done with that man
The ropes on the windows
Tattoo your hands
Look at you, you're a bird and a bee
Should've known that'd be company you keep
You used to say, that you're a

Hard man
A real man's man
What's your momma gone do
When she find out what you're into?
Mr. Hardman
Mr. Man's man
Now you can go and
Be some other man's man

Stupid me, I fell back onto your knife
It only took three weeks, to hustle me into being your wife
You called me cryin', scared in jail
Hard man is terrified
Begging me to pay his bail
You used to say that you're a

Hard man
A real man's man
What's your momma gone do
When she find out what you're into?
Mr. Hardman
Mr. Man's man
Now you can go and
Be some other man's man

You can spend all his money
You can waste all his time
You said I had to blow somebody
But you blend it on cocaine lines
Oh, and by the way
While you were away
I fucked somebody
On our one year wedding anniversary day

Hard man
Real man's man
What's your momma gone do
When she find out what you're into?
Mr. Hardman
Mr. Man's man
Now you can go and
Be some other man's man
