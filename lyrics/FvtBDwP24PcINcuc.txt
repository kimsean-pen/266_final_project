You're alone
You're on your own
So what, have you gone blind
Have you forgotten what you have and what is yours?
Glass half empty, glass half full

Well either way you won't be going thirsty
Count your blessings not your flaws.
You've got it all

You lost your mind in the sound
There's so much more, you can reclaim your crown
You're in control
Rid of the monsters inside your head
Put all your faults to bed
You can be King again.
You don't get what all this is about
You're too wrapped up in your self-doubt

You've got that young blood, set it free.
You've got it all
You lost your mind in the sound

There's so much more, you can reclaim your crown
You're in control
Rid of the monsters inside your head
Put all your faults to bed
You can be King.
There's method in my madness
There's no logic in your sadness
You don't gain a single thing from misery

Take it from me.
You've got it all
You lost your mind in the sound
There's so much more, you can reclaim your crown

You're in control
Rid of the monsters inside your head
Put all your faults to bed
You can be King.
You've got it all
You lost your mind in the sound
There's so much more, you can reclaim your crown
You're in control
Rid of the monsters inside your head
Put all your faults to bed
You can be King again.
