When I feel why I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood
To learn what you think you know
There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see

But at your best, you are love
You're a positive motivating
Force with in my life
Should you ever feel
The need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know

Let me know
When you feel what you feel
Hard, hard, hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place
Before this love affair began
But if you feel like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about, all about

But at your best, you are love
You're a positive motivating
Force with in my life
Should you ever feel
The need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know

Tell me what it is to mean to make believe
Make believe, no need to make believe
Look beyond your world
Try to find a place for me
Try to find, find a place for me
'Cause

At your best, you are love
You're a positive motivating
Force within my life
Should you ever feel
The need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
