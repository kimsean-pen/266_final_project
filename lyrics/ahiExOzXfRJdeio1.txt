Now fall into a vacant sphere
Pierced by the darkness
They called it death
And surrounded me with sleep

They lost the earth in fire
Waved it into a sea
This is not what you saw
The Earth in fire

Now fall into a vacant sphere
Pierced by the darkness
They called it death
And surrounded me with sleep
