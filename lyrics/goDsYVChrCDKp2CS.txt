There's been a lot of miscommunication lately
A lot of wait and see and too many maybes
And I wanna believe that your faith in me is as strong as it was when we thought we'd be unbreakable

All the words we say end up distorted
From skinbreak to heartache without warning
And you don't mean it and I don't either
We get so close to being defeated by circumstance
Do we stand a chance to rise above it all
But I feel so small

Lay your weapons down
And I'll take my armor off
Say what we need to say
And love before it's lost
'Cause what we have is real
And real can hurt sometimes
But just because it hurts doesn't mean that we say goodbye
So lay your weapons down, ooh
Lay your weapons down, ooh

Feel so uncomfortable in this silence
Behind these invisible walls we build inside us
So what's gonna give and what will it take for us to admit that we're both gonna break if we stay right here
Don't wanna stay right here

Lay your weapons down
And I'll take my armor off
Say what we need to say
And love before it's lost
'Cause what we have is real
And real can hurt sometimes
But just because it hurts doesn't mean that we say goodbye
So lay your weapons down, ooh
Lay your weapons down, ooh

I wanna rise above it all
Will you hold me, just hold me

And lay your weapons down
And I'll take my armor off
Say what we need to say
And love before it's lost
'Cause what we have is real
And real can hurt sometimes
But just because it hurts doesn't mean that we say goodbye
So lay your weapons down, ooh
Lay your weapons down, ooh
Lay your weapons down, ooh
Lay your weapons down, ooh
