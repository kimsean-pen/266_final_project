You know it's unfair that I am here and you are there.
I feel short in the exchange- I show you mine you walk away.
I'm wearing mine out on my sleeve, you're wearing yours where I can't see,
but I'll remember your face for years to come
and wonder what you thought about when you got home.

Honestly is like a kiss on the lips.
Come closer and I'll tell you exactly how it is.
Now I'm barely breathing, I'm moving ahead,
but if I see you smile, it's gonna knock me dead.

I'm stiff in my tracks trying to recover
from whatever drug you used to put me under.

I don't believe in love at first sight.
I don't believe in love at first sight.
It's hard enough for me to not fall in love with every person I see.

I let my mind get turned inside out
just to see what the kids were laughing about.
It wasn't worth understanding something
I could've gone my whole life not knowing.

You know what they say about curiosity.
That murderer had his chokehold on me.
I ran away without looking back,
but every now and then I want what I can't have.

I'm still thinking of a man from years ago-
eyes open wide in the front row,
dark features, leaning on the doorframe.
I would've sold my soul to know his first name.

I don't believe in love at first sight.
I don't believe in love at first sight.
I don't believe in love at first sight.
Maybe I would if you looked at me right.
