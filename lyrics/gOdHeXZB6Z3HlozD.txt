The secret Lights in the Sky
Vision
All one
It seems

The Blades are sharpened
They will all learn
Yes, Destroy your Dream
Your Desert of Dreams
It's undeserved
For Dark Medieval Times

Here, upon the Hill
You all find Wisdom

Waiting for a lot of
Endless screaming

Ending

Desert of Dreams
Eternity in your Dreams
Here you are
Dark Medieval Times
