I had to leave because
I had to say no and stop
More than once
Way too many times
And you just kept trying to change my mind

So I left, it was 3AM
And I slept in the middle of my bed
With the comfort of my own choices
Yeah I bet you didn't even think about what you did

Could it be true?
You don't seem like that kind of guy
Not you, you've got that one song that I like
They said he's got one song that I like

Now I don't even know why I went
Every light on the way was screaming at me 'red'
Now you've got me questioning everything I did
Or what would've happened if I'd done one thing different

And I saw it, the face of god
And he turned himself away from me
And said I did something wrong
That somehow what happened to me was my fault
You can see it in apologies, still hear it in the songs

Could it be true?
You couldn't do that to someone
Not you, nah your music is too good
They said your music is too good
Kept saying your music is too good
They said your music is too good
