Sick and tired of this world
There's no more air
Trippin' over myself
Goin' nowhere
Waiting
Suffocating
No direction
I took a dive

And on the way down
I saw you
And you saved me
From myself
And I won't forget
The way you loved me
On the way down
I almost fell right through
But I held onto you

I've been wondering why
It's only me?
Have you always been inside
Waiting to breathe?
It's alright
Sunlight
On my face
I wake up and yeah, I'm alive

'Cause on the way down
I saw you
And you saved me
From myself
And I won't forget
The way you loved me
On the way down
I almost fell right through
But I held onto you

I was so afraid
Of going under
But now
The weight of the world
Feels like nothing, no, nothin'

Down, down, down
You're all I wanted
Down, down, down
You're all I needed now
Down, down, down
You're all I wanted
You're all I needed

And I won't forget the way you loved me
All that I wanted
All that I needed now

Oh! On the way down
I saw you
And you saved me
From myself
And I won't forget
The way you loved me
On the way down
I almost fell right through
But I held onto you

Down, down, down
But I held onto you
Down, down, down
But I held onto you
