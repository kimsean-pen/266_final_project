Monochrome, it's a Saturn world
Lying beneath the rings
And they tell me we don't have a long time 'til our decline
All the grown men are set in their ways
Shining in the street
And they tell me we don't have a long time, a great design

Why don't you shame the world
Shame it with your words and I'll smile
Why don't you shame the world
Shame it with words and I'll finally make believe

I'll atone for the saddle verse
Dry beneath my feet
And they tell me I don't have a long time to change your mind

All the grown men are set in their ways
Shining in the street
And they tell me we don't have a long time, a great design

Shame the world
Shame it with your words and I'll smile
We always have the tender words to my mind
