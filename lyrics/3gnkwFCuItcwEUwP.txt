Well, sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you do
And in my head, I make a picture
'Cause since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress

Won't you come on over?
And stop makin' a fool out of me
And why don't you come on over Valerie?
Valerie

Did you have to go to jail
Put your house up on for sale
did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan
I hope you'll find the right man
who'll fix it for ya

Are you shoppin' anywhere
Changed the color of you hair, are you busy?
And did you have to pay the fine
You were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy?

Yeah, 'cause since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress

Won't you come on over?
And stop makin' a fool out of me
Oh, why don't you come on over Valerie?
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie

Well, sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doin'
And in my head I make a picture

'Cause since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
And stop makin' a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie?
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie, yeah, Valerie
