Stand before the gates and watch metropolis
Empires come and go, we live forever
And eternity is in your hidden eyes
Take my broken wings, teach me to fly again

I stand alone, we stand alone
I stand alone, we stand alone

Down the empty streets, head for the seven hills
Vestal virgins dance, we steal the fire
Battered columns stand as silent monuments
Deep inside their dreams I see your memories

I stand alone, we stand alone
I stand alone, we stand alone
I stand alone, we stand alone

We share the last champagne and watch necropolis
Still and so let's leave her to her silent walks
The sun of Rome is set and our day is gone
A kiss, a taste of red from your open lips

I stand alone, we stand alone
I stand alone, we stand alone
I stand alone, we stand alone
I stand alone, we stand alone

We stand alone
We stand alone
We stand alone
We stand alone
Alone
