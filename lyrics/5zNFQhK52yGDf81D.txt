'Cause of you
I'm laying awake at night
All I'm seeing are pictures of you
As I close my eyes
I fade my way into the laws of my dreamworld
It's a place of trust
Will you meet me there?
There's no time to spare
Come on, show me you care
Here, we can make anything become real

All of my dreams are all I see
Try not to wake me can't you see?
All of my dreams are all I wanna see
Try not to wake me
Try not to wake me

'Cause of you
My tries to not think of you
They just end up in one million thoughts
It's way too much to mention
See what I mean, when you see my creation
It's a place of trust
I can meet you there
There's no time to spare
Come on, show me you care
What you believe in will here become real

All of my dreams are all I see
Try not to wake me can't you see?
All of my dreams are all I wanna see
Try not to wake me
Try not to wake me

All of my dreams are all I see
Try not to wake me can't you see?
All of my dreams are all I wanna see
Try not to wake me
Try not to wake me

Trapped inside my own dreams
I'm not complaining
Leave behind
A lie of any kind
Here it can disappear

All of my dreams are all I see (I see)
Try not to wake me can't you see? (can't you see?)
All of my dreams are all I wanna see (no)
Try not to wake me
Try not to wake me

All of my dreams are all I see (I see)
Try not to wake me can't you see? (can't you see?)
All of my dreams are all I wanna see (no)
Try not to wake me
Try not to wake me

(Try not to wake me)
