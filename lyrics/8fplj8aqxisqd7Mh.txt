I know something that's gonna break your heart
Don't say I don't love you
I know something that's gonna break your heart
Who am I to tell you?
Love's a dangerous disguise
For a pair of starving eyes
I hate to tell you but I'm gonna fail you
Tonight can never let us down
Tomorrow will break your heart
I know something that's gonna break your heart
And I'll always love you
I know something that's gonna break my heart If I ever tell you
Love's a theater of needs
For a pair of hopeless leads
You won't believe me but you're gonna break me too
Tonight can never let us down
Tomorrow will break your heart
Now I'm gonna break your heart
