This blood on my hands (Hands)
This blood on my hands (Hands)
This blood on my hands (Hands)
This blood on my hands, on my hands
Blood on my hands

Wake up in the middle of ascending in the night
With some tears on my pillow and this blood on my knife
And my soul has stained the sheets, but they're pulled off to the side
Whose blood could this be? Is it yours or is it mine?
Take the knife and twist it, where's my heart? You missed it
You know I don't wanna die but, baby, you insisted
Breathing is a luxury that I just shouldn't have
My heart just keeps on beating, and it's more than you can stand

Baby, please just tell me how we ever went so wrong
We used to sing together when we used to sing this song
We can never sing forever 'cause now my voice is gone
Guess I'm gone forever and you knew it all along

I can see blood, all over my hands
The longer you lay next to me, the further I ran
What's it all worth? How much can you stand?
The longer you stay close to me, the further I ran

This blood on my hands (Hands)
This blood on my hands (Hands)
This blood on my hands (Hands)
This blood on my hands (Hands)

I'm only evil when I need to be, but you did this so easily
I try to treat you equally and listen to your reasoning
But you waited so eagerly while plotting and deceiving me
You came behind me secretly and shattered every piece of me

I had nothing to give, so I gave you my life
Didn't wanna see me live, so you gave me your knife
Didn't hear you as you tiptoed coming from behind
You took away my kid, so I guess you killed me twice

Dragged me into the night 'cause it's the one thing you keep
You knew that I had to die so you could finally sleep
There's blood all over your knife, you know you earned yourself
And it's a matter of time until you burn in hell

I can see blood all over my hands
The longer you lay next to me, the further I ran
What's it all worth? How much can you stand?
The longer you stay close to me, the further I ran

This blood on my hands (Hands)

No remorse holds no recourse
Now I'm leaving slowly
Oh, won't you hold me?

No remorse holds no recourse
Now I'm leaving slowly
Oh, won't you hold me?

I can see blood all over my hands
The longer you lay next to me, the further I ran
What's it all worth? How much can you stand?
The longer you stay close to me, the further I ran

I can see blood all over my hands
The longer you lay next to me, the further I ran
What's it all worth? How much can you stand?
The longer you stay close to me, the further I ran

This blood on my hands
This blood on my hands
This blood on my hands
This blood on my hands
