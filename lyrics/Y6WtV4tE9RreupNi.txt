I remember how you used to say my name
But your voice today, it doesn't sound the same
I guess I'm getting used to letting go these days
But I'm trying not to falter, and I'm trying not to break

But Sarah's got a hold of my wrist and she won't let go
Who am I kidding?
It feels good, this burst of chemicals
It's what I've been missing

I'm watching from the window of my room
Pretending to be okay without you
But it's like I'm never enough, never enough
You're always giving up, giving up
I'm more than you can carry

Warning sign, am I ever gonna listen?
Piece of mind, too much for me to handle
I'll get by just fine, I'll get by just fine with artificial vices

I tried to follow all the steps with you
You tried to fall in love with someone new
(I'll get by, get by, I'll get by just fine without you)

But Sarah's got a hold of my wrist and she won't let go
Who am I kidding?
It feels good, this burst of chemicals
It's what I've been missing

I'm watching from the window of my room
Pretending to be okay without you
But it's like I'm never enough, never enough
You're always giving up, giving up
I'm more than you can carry

Wish I could see some light
Wish I could feel just alright again
I'm dissecting your white lies, they light up the dark side of you
I wanna tell you

You're always giving up, giving up
It's like I'm not enough
Not enough for you

I'm watching from the window of my room
Pretending to be okay without you
But it's like I'm never enough, never enough
You're always giving up, giving up
I'm more than you can carry
