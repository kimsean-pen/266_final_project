Turn around and look and see what you been missing
Look behind you and put on your glasses forward vision
Maybe one day we'll be more than we were way, way back when
Maybe then they'll listen
Maybe then the world will understand

If you follow me, see mysteries up in the stars
Like a rocket ship, your clothes, I wanna take them, take off
I'm wounded but cured with you when you take that sword
Lay here with me, lay here with me, hell yeah

Feel no shame
Feel no shame
Lay all night, all day
Lay here with me
Lay here with me
Shamelessly

You unlock my phone, you look through all my messages
You were lurkin' at my life from a di-di-di-distance
You were checkin' out the comments I was leaving
Adding letters up, subtracting numbers, jumping to conclusions
You should know, know
Oh youngin' you should know, nah nah
There's no one, no
True love ain't digital, nah nah
It's a parallel universe, it's not real
No, no, but you're here with me
You persisted
You resisted
You fought everything
You insisted
You predicted
I'd be in your hand
Took some courage to man up and make some better plans
All that I know, all that I know

Feel no shame
I feel no shame
Feel no less than the real
Lay baby, lay with me
Lay me, lay me, lay me, lay me

Oooh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Oooh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Oooh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Oooh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Shame, shame, shame, shame, shame, shame
Shame, shame, shame, shame, shame, shame
Shame, shame, shame, shame, shame, shame...
