Forty more than I can take today
Wrap it up in cellophane
Throwing out for safety's sake
'Cause they'll just think it sounds the same

(Chorus)
I'll go a day
I'll go a day
I've gone for days

I know a way
I know the way
But I can't speak

And if I stay
Well I'll have to make this up
Sixteen days to find a way
To try and get this shut

And I'll be gone
So I'll be safe
Busy scratching out this ache
Taking pressure off my face
We'll throw this out for safety's sake

(Chorus)
I'll go a day
I'll go a day
I've gone for weeks

I know a way
I know a way
But I can't speak

And if I stay
Well I'll have to make this up
Sixteen days to find a way
To try and get this shut
