Your confetti ain't even heavy nigga
Got the win, I want the record nigga
What's a crown if you don't protect it, nigga?
What's a name if they don't respect it, nigga?
Nah, your confetti ain't even heavy

These niggas fucking up the game
This shit is so suspicious
You ain't buy it all unless you blew a ticket
All up in the VIP, but you ain't fuck them bitches
I'ma ball all summer just to flex for Christmas
Angel wings on the doors, I gotta suplex em'
Money don't make you fly, that's just my perspective
Running up the score just to expose a bluff
'Cause nowadays gettin' a win just ain't enough
Fuck the check up last week, I got a new agenda
The last time I couldn't buy some shit?
I can't remember
The last time I fucked the world, I must've bust the center
I bought a crib and set that bitch on top of Mount Olympus
When you living that high up, it's hard to see the tension
I'm only selling game, I'm all out of simping
Grip the foreign like a trophy, gotta hold it steady
Fuck your party when your confetti ain't even heavy, nigga

Got the win, I want the record nigga
What's a crown if you don't protect it, nigga?
What's a name if they don't respect it, nigga?
Nah, your confetti ain't even heavy

We all off in the club like Sincere in Belly
Can't even drink my liquor, money on my celly
Account it like you got a check, spend it when you ready
I'm giving niggas hell, pray I go to heaven
Nailing in they coffin, the cost of them being off it
Balling since Iverson crossed you
Winner's circle, my office
Fucking off with these wins
You fucking up with this loss
Waiter forgot my season, I'm glad that they throwin' that salt
Might just throw a toss and holla fuck it
'Cause when your wrist game know the grip changed
Nigga buckets
Chip rain in the strip game, hoes will bust it
Snakes come, chop they heads off
Kobe clutching on a meal ticket
Motherfuck you if you feel different
I caught a break, no debate, and you still fishing
The genie out the bottle and you still wishing
Know my downfall 'cause you petty

Confetti ain't even heavy nigga
Got the win, I want the record nigga
What's a crown if you don't protect it, nigga?
What's a name if they don't respect it, nigga?
Nah, your confetti ain't even heavy
