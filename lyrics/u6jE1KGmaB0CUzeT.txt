Catch the man-beast in the well in the hell on the back
Watch out! You've got no shield
Break up! He's got no peace
Breath deep in the shade in the fade of the luck
Watch out! You've got no light!
No pure cell can live

Shoot the first head, shoot the first hand
Press the "Greed", get the pale shield for your eyes
Shoot the third eye, shoot the third line
Press the "Blood", watch out, watch out for the beam

Shoot the first head, shoot the last tail
Press the "Risk", get the hale shield for your eyes
I just need to hit to kick the dead eye
Press the next eye, I can get so...

Liquid eye, Sticky eye, Tricky eye
How to fake to steal?
Your heart's got cracked!

Get the new toy, it's falling in 50 parts
Break Up! You've got no paste
Throw out! It's biting your fate like a bait like a sweet dust
You've got no hand and no pure cell can cross

Shoot the first head, shoot the first hand
Press the "Greed", get the pale shield for your eyes
Shoot the third eye, shoot the third line
Press the "Blood", look out for the beam

Shoot the first head, shoot the last tail
Press the "Risk", get the hale shield for your eyes
I just hate to say to pay the dead eye
Press the next light, I can get so...

Liquid eye, Sticky eye, Tricky eye, Flashy eye
How to fake? How to make 50 times more eyes to get cracked?
Your hearts got plastic

Catch the man-beast in the well on your hand on your left
Wake up! You've got no fist
Look up! No peace will be seen
In your hand in the shade of your mind
Watch out! You've got no right
Your pure cell can't spark

Shoot the first head, shoot the first hand
Press the "Greed", get the pale shield for your eyes
Shoot the third eye, shoot the third line
Press the "Blood", watch out, watch out for the beam

Shoot the first head, shoot the last tail
Press the "Risk", get the hale shield for your eyes
I just need to hit to kick the dead eye
Press the next eye, I can get so...

Liquid eye, Sticky eye, Tricky eye, Flashy eye
Where to fake? Where to make?
