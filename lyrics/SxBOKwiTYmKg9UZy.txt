We're turning our world round its upside down
Get back our hopes because we're dreaming
We are the ones that can change this now
Yeah

Love is in a soul that's breaking free
Riding a wave of this energy
We're turning our world round its upside down
Yeah

This here
This is our story
This is the journey of our lives
We won't stop
This is our moment
These are the tales of tomorrow
These are the tales of tomorrow
These are the tales of tomorrow
These are the tales of tomorrow
These are the tales of tomorrow

We're turning our world round its upside down
Sharing the love we are receiving
We are one and we let it all out
Yeeaah

Love is in a soul that's breaking free
Riding a wave of this energy
We're turning our world round its upside down
Yeah

This here
This is our story
This is the journey of our lives
We won't stop
This is our moment
These are the tales of tomorrow
These are the tales of tomorrow
These are the tales of tomorrow
These are the tales of tomorrow
These are the tales of tomorrow
These are the tales of tomorrow
