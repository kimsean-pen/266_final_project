She's been, thinkin', life ain't, givin' her what she needs
What can, make her, happy, is always out of her reach
Somebody gotta help me
But she, could not, see that, everything she wanted
Was in-side of, her heart, but she wouldn't give it away
No, she wouldn't give it away

We don't need no mournful sound
Shake your graveclothes to the ground
Shake your graveclothes off, shake your graveclothes,
Shake your graveclothes off, shake your graveclothes
Thoughts you're thinkin' make you feel like you're dead
But you can grow a garden out the top of your head
Shake your graveclothes off, shake your graveclothes,
Shake your graveclothes off, shake your graveclothes

Don't get lost inside your head
Don't get lost inside your head
Don't get lost inside your head
Don't get lost inside your head

He's been, wishin', he was, the best and the brightest
Scared to, give what, he's got, no he wouldn't give it away
Self-deprecation, lack of motivation, stealing his aliveness
In the silence love abounds and has already filled the spaces
And replaces them with grace if he would only stop to feel, to see

We don't need no mournful sound
Shake your graveclothes to the ground
Shake your graveclothes off, shake your graveclothes,
Shake your graveclothes off, shake your graveclothes
Thoughts you're thinkin' make you feel like you're dead
But you can grow a garden out the top of your head
Shake your graveclothes off, shake your graveclothes,
Shake your graveclothes off, shake your graveclothes
