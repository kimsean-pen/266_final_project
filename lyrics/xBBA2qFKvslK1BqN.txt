i called my dealer, but he aint dealin
a solid soul can be revealing
his set up is on his by-car
its on fire

once more for reverb
received in gold
what kind of song
could be in my head?

to sell us
we burn this icon
its on fire

and we cant see where it came from
the choice ive made cant be undone
the only train weve seen wont go
im losing sleep for bein slow

(waaa)

inside the city inseams
republic of the Lachine dont matter
course you dont matter

despite the tremors with we
our love in blackest country be brighter
dearest you flatter me
be doobie brothers were wild
when they wrote
"Minute By Minute"
ZWY-ON ZWY-ON BE DIBBIE DEE AH
DIP DIP DIP DIP DIP DIP ZWY=ON

so dont you worry bout a thang
the wings i grew are sheltering
the nights we lay together in
this city needs us we need them
