Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracksand now I'm trying to get back

Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
Nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some
I won't hesitate no more, no more

It cannot wait, I'm yours
Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free

Look into your heart and you'll find love love love
Listen to the music of the moment maybe sing with me
A la peaceful melody

And It's our God-forsaken right to be loved love loved love loved
So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short

This is our fate, I'm yours
Scooch closer dearand i will nibble your ear
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
My breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and laughed
I guess what i be saying is there ain't no better reason

To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue
I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is shortthis is our fate, I'm yours
Well no no, well open up your mind and see like me

Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love
Listen to the music of the moment come and dance with me
A lá one big family (2nd time: A lá happy family; 3rd time: A lápeaceful melody)
It's your God-forsaken right to be loved love love love
I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours
No please, don't complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours
No please, don't hesitateno more, no more
It cannot wait
The sky is your's!
