I see you beside me
Its only a dream
A vision of what used to be
The laughter, the sorrow
Pictures of times
Fading to memories

How could I ever let you go
Is it too late to let you know

I've tried to run from your side
But each place I hide
It only reminds me of you
When I turn out all the lights
Even the night
It only reminds me of you

I needed my freedom
That's what I thought
But I was a fool to believe
My heart lied while you cried
Rivers of tears
But I was too blind to see

Everything we been through before
Now it means so much more, yeah

I've tried to run from your side
But each place I hide

It only reminds me of you
When I turn out all the lights
Even the nights
It only reminds me of you
Only you

So come back to me
I'm down on my knees
Boy can't you see?

How could I ever let you go
Is it too late to let you know

I've tried to run from your side
But each place I hide
It only reminds me of you
When I turn out all the lights
Even the night
It only reminds me of you
I've tried to run from your side
But each place I hide
It only reminds me of you
When I turn out all the lights
Even the night
It only reminds me of you
You.
Only reminds me of you
