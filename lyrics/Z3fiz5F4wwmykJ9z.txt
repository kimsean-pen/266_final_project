49 times we fought that beast
Your old man and me
It had a chicken head with duck feet
With woman's face too
(Oh, that's rad!)

And it was waiting in the bushes for us
Then ripped off your dad's face
He was screaming something awful

In fact it was this huge mess
I had to change the floors
(The floors?)

You see his blood it drained into the boards
And I had to change them
But we all got a chicken duck woman thing
Waiting for us

Everyday I worry all day
About what's waiting in the bushes of love
'Cause something is waiting in the bushes for us
Something is waiting in the bushes of love
Everyday I worry all day
About what's waiting in the bushes of love
'Cause something is waiting in the bushes for us
Something is waiting in the bushes of love

Yo, never knew my dad
He didn't care about me
Dead horizon is all my macrobinoculars see
Moisture-farming all my life, not a drop spilt
My aunt and uncle, double suns
I'm sipping blue milk
My aunt and uncle, double suns
I'm sick of blue milk

But then a desert hobo came and told me
We all got a chicken duck woman thing waiting for us

Everyday I worry all day
About what's waiting in the bushes of love
'Cause something is waiting in the bushes for us
Something is waiting in the bushes of love
Everyday I worry all day

About what's waiting in the bushes of love
Something is waiting in the bushes for us
Something is waiting in the bushes of love

Hold me, when I open like a flower
Hold me right
And I ain't had to bake for girl in a long time
A long time
I thing my cooking's awesome
I've got a picture in my photo wagon
Ha ha, I keep it popping

Yeah, she'd probably loved to honky tonk
(She'd probably loved to honky tonk)
That's what I said. Mmmmm
(Waiting for us)

I used to ride across the desert, you know
I used to glide on my speeder and pray
That I don't find what I don't want to find
Waiting for me around the corner, oh no, no
(Waiting for us)

I used to ride across the desert, you know
I used to glide on my speeder and pray
That I don't find anymore crispy bodies by the door

49 times, it was 49 times
And now it might be waiting for you
Could be hidding behind this scrap pile
(It's just a big cow)
I know you really want someone to hold you
But we all got a chicken duck woman thing waiting for us

Everyday I worry all day
About what's waiting in the bushes of love
Something is waiting in the bushes for us
Something is waiting in the bushes of love

Everyday I worry all day (all day)
About what was waiting in the bushes of love
Something is waiting in the bushes for us
Something is waiting in the bushes of love
Everyday I worry all day (I used to ride across the desert, you know)
About what's waiting in the bushes of love (I used to glide on my speeder and pray)
Something is waiting in the bushes for us (That I don't find what I don't want to find)
Something is waiting in the bushes of love (Waiting for me around the corner, oh no, no)
Everyday I worry all day about what's waiting (I used to ride across the desert, you know)
In the bushes of love (I used to glide on my speeder and pray)
Something is waiting in the bushes for us (That I don't find what I don't want to find)
Something is waiting in the bushes of love (Waiting for me around the corner, oh no, no)

I used to ride across the desert, you know
I used to glide on my speeder and pray
That I don't find what I don't want to find
Waiting for me around the corner, oh no, no
(Waiting for us)

I used to ride across the desert, you know
