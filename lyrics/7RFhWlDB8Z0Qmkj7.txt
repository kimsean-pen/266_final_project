I braved the sea of ice
Cut to the bone
I was frozen and blue
Just to see you
I followed all your signs
Pressed through the snow
I was battered and bruised
Just to see you

I followed footsteps going nowhere
Until I realized you don't care
Hiding in plain sight
Messing with my mind
Looking on as I bled there
Fucking predator, how do you dare?
To play dead

Mimicry
Shifting with the light
Changing by the night
You're a glorious lie
I'll never find you
Creature of disguise
You just take a life
And play dead

Mimicry
Shifting with the light
Changing by the night
You're a glorious lie
I'll never find you
Creature of disguise
You just take a life
And play dead

My lips turned arctic white
From kissing the cold
I was gasping for warmth
Just to see you
I swear I got it right
I did as you told
And I left my own north
Just to see you

I followed footsteps going nowhere
Until I realized you don't care
Hiding in plain sight
Messing with my mind
Looking on as I bled there
Fucking predator, how do you dare?
To play dead

Mimicry
Shifting with the light
Changing by the night
You're a glorious lie
I'll never find you
Creature of disguise
You just take a life
And play dead

Mimicry
Shifting with the light
Changing by the night
You're a glorious lie
I'll never find you
Creature of disguise
You just take a life
And play dead
