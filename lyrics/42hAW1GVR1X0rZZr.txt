Don't go looking for snakes, you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun, you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?

Oh, watch the puppets dancing
Yeah, see the clowns fall down
Hey, tie your tap shoes tightly
Yeah, wear them into town

See you crawling
See you crawling in

Don't go looking for snakes, you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun, you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?
There ain't no heroes here, no, no more

Hey, hey, hey
Oh, play the game so nicely
Oh, check, it's your move now
Yeah, we're standing in this jungle
Yeah, with serpents I have found

See you crawling
See you crawling in

Don't go looking for snakes, you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun, you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?
Have your heroes disappeared?

See you crawling
See you crawling in

So, don't go looking for snakes, you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun, you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?
No, there ain't no heroes here, no, no

Haven't I seen you here before?
No, there ain't no heroes here

Don't go looking for snakes, you might find them
Yeah, haven't I seen you here before?
Have your heroes disappeared?
Don't send your eyes to the sun, you might blind them
