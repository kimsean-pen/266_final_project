Escucha el ritmo de tu corazón
(Feel the rhythm)

From the coast of Ipanema
To the Island of Capri
All the way to Kuala Lumpur
I will follow you wherever you may be

From the moment I first saw you
Knew my heart could not be free
Have to hold you in my arms now
There can never be another for me

All I need is
The rhythm divine
Lost in the music
Your heart will be mine

All I need is
To look in your eyes
Viva la música!
Say you'll be mine

Can you feel the heat of passion
Can you taste our love's sweet wine
Join the dance and let it happen
Put tomorrow cares right out of your mind

As the music draws you closer
And you fall under my spell
I will catch you in my arms now
Where the night can take us no one can tell

All I need is
The rhythm divine
Lost in the music
Your heart will be mine

All I need is
To look in your eyes
Viva la música!
Say you'll be mine

Gotta have this feeling forever
Gotta live this moment together
Nothing else matters
Just you and the night

Follow on the wings of desire
Now the rhythm's taking you higher
No one can stop us from having it all
You are my heart, you are my soul

All I need is
The rhythm divine
Lost in the music
You're heart will be mine

All I need is
The look in your eyes
Viva la música!
Say you'll be mine

All I need is
The rhythm divine
Lost in the music
Your heart will be mine

All I need is
To look in your eyes
Viva la música!
Say you'll be mine

Can you feel the rhythm?
Can you feel the rhythm?
Can you feel the rhythm?
Burning, burning

Can you feel the rhythm?
Can you feel the rhythm?
Can you feel the rhythm?
Burning, burning

Can you feel the rhythm?
Can you feel the rhythm?
Can you feel the rhythm?
Burning, burning

Can you feel the rhythm?
Can you feel the rhythm?
Can you feel the rhythm?
Burning, burning
