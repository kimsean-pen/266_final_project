I can't believe I still get like this
My body on fire, breathless
I only want to be alone with you, oh

It's all right, I'm coming for you, baby
Hold tight, let me break on you like a wave
Don't you pretend that you can't feel it, oh

I'm yours tonight if you say that you want it
Oh-yeah, oh-yeah
Our paradise, if you think you can go there
Oh-yeah, oh-yeah

A sweet summer love vacation
Feeling the good vibrations
Our paradise, if you say that you want it
Oh-yeah, oh-yeah

I can see us sippin' a little too much
Is it me talking or is it the rum?
You take me underneath the golden sun, oh

All right, I'm coming for you, baby
Hold tight, let me break on you like a wave
Don't you pretend like you can't feel it, oh-yeah

I'm yours tonight if you say that you want it
Oh-yeah, oh-yeah
Our paradise, if you think you can go there
Oh-yeah, oh-yeah

A sweet summer love vacation
Feeling the good vibrations
Our paradise, if you say that you want it
Oh-yeah, oh-yeah

My baby's shy, baby's shy, but he knows it's right
Make you mine, come alive, it's the perfect time
My baby's shy, baby's shy, but he knows it's right
Make you mine, come alive, it's the perfect time

I'm yours tonight if you say that you want it
Oh-yeah, oh-yeah
Our paradise, if you think you can go there
Oh-yeah, oh-yeah

A sweet summer love vacation
Feeling the good vibrations
Our paradise, if you say that you want it
Oh-yeah, oh-yeah

Oh-yeah, oh-yeah
Oh-yeah, oh-yeah
