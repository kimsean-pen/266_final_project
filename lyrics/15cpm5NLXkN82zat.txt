If I wasn't a celebrity
Would you be so nice to me
If I didn't have cheese like every day
Would you still wanna be with me
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me
If I wasn't a celebrity

Lately
I've been doing a little thinkin' 'bout the things that satisfy you
It's making me wonder 'bout the things that you see in me
I hate the way you like to say your man's a celebrity
Baby what's the deal, I thought you wanted me for me

You gotta say what you mean
You gotta mean what you say
'Cause you keep pushin' me away
'Cause I ain't got no time to play, so I say

If I wasn't a celebrity
Would you be so nice to me
If I didn't have cheese like every day
Would you still wanna be with me
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me
If I wasn't a celebrity

Celebrity, celebrity, celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity, celebrity, celebrity

I'm glad that you are having a good time
livin' the life that I've laid out for me
Constantly splurgin', spending my money on everything you see
It would be diferent if you had something
Maybe like a J-O-B
You need to get your thing together, yeah

You gotta stop runnin' games, sayin'
It ain't about my fame
'Cause you know if things weren't this way
You'd be gone a long time ago, so I say

If I wasn't a celebrity
Would you be so nice to me
If I didn't have cheese like every day
Would you still wanna be with me
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me
If I wasn't a celebrity

If you really loved me,
you'd try and show me it ain't even about my name
But you try to use me, you lie to fool me
So it can never be the same
So now I'm leaving you behind
I've found somebody who can love me for me
And that's all I need, yeah

Celebrity, celebrity, celebrity, celebrity
Celebrity, celebrity, celebrity, celebrity

If I wasn't a celebrity
Would you be so nice to me
If I didn't have cheese like every day
Would you still wanna be with me
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me
If I wasn't a celebrity

If I wasn't a celebrity
Would you be so nice to me
If I didn't have cheese like every day
Would you still wanna be with me
If I couldn't buy you diamond rings
And all those other expensive things
Would you be so into me
If I wasn't a celebrity
