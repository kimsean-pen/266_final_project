We are the ones taking all the pain,
Falling on our faces they don't care anyway
Anyway, now
You're the one that makes me feel like I'm alive
You're the one that pushes me all the time,
All the time, now.
We are hard at play
Always praised to do what they say
Calling me deranged
Feeling power, I must take its place some way

Never gonna run away seeking out the path
But the pain always gets in the way
Slowly watch me die I'm insane so dangerous
Don't you dare get in my way
Throwing in the towel got me strained, so betrayed
Get the fuck out of my way
Looking at my thoughts, I take my time
Pounding all these spikes in my veins

We are the ones reaching out in vain
Trying to solve our problems they won't go away
Go away now
You're the one that makes me feel like I'm alive
You're the one that pushes me all the time
All the time, now.
We are hard at play,
Always praised to do what they say
Calling me deranged
Feeling power, I must take its place some way

Never gonna run away seeking out the path
But the pain always gets in the way
Slowly watch me die I'm insane so dangerous
Don't you dare get in my way
Throwing in the towel got me strained, so betrayed
Get the fuck out of my way
Looking at my thoughts, I take my time
Pounding all these spikes in my veins

Pounding all these spikes in my veins!
Pounding all these spikes in my veins!
Pounding all these spikes in my veins!

Never gonna run away seeking out the path
But the pain always gets in the way
Slowly watch me die I'm insane so dangerous
Don't you dare get in my way
Throwing in the towel got me strained, so betrayed
Get the fuck out of my way
Looking at my thoughts, I take my time
Pounding all these spikes in my veins

Pounding all these spikes in my veins!
Pounding all these spikes in my veins!
Pounding all these spikes in my veins!
Pounding all these spikes in my veins!
Pounding all these spikes in my veins!
Looking at my thoughts, I take my time
Pounding all these spikes in my veins!
