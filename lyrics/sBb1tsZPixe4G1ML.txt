Oui, je t'aime
Oui, je t'aime
A demain, a la prochaine
I know it's best to say goodbye
But I can't seem to move away
Not to say, not to say
That you shouldn't share the blame
There is a softness to your touch
There is a wonder to your ways

Don't know
How I feel
What's the deal?
Is it real?
When's it gonna go down?
Can we talk? Can we not?
Well I'm here
Won't you tell me right now?
And I'll care for you
Oh, careful you

Don't know
Should we stay?
Should we go?
Should we back it up and turn it around?
Take the good with the bad
Still believe we can make it somehow
I will care for you
Oh, careful you
Careful you

Oui, je t'aime
Oui, je t'aime
From the cradle to the grave
You've done a number on my heart
And things will never be the same
Freeze a frame, freeze a frame
From a fever dream of days
We learned the secret of a kiss
And how it melts away all pain

Don't know
How I feel
What's the deal?
Is it real?
When's it gonna go down?
Can we talk? Can we not?
Well I'm here
Won't you tell me right now?
And I'll care for you
Oh, careful you

Don't know
Should we stay?
Should we go?
Should we back it up and turn it around?
Take the good with the bad
Still believe we can make it somehow
I will care for you
Oh, careful you
Careful you

Don't know
How I feel
What's the deal?
Is it real?
When's it gonna go down?
Can we talk? Can we not?
Well I'm here
Won't you tell me right now?
And I'll care for you
Oh, careful you

Don't know
Should we stay?
Should we go?
Should we back it up and turn it around?
Take the good with the bad
Still believe we can make it somehow
I will care for you
Oh, careful you
Careful you
