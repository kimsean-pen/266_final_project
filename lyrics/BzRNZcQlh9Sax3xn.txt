I ain't got nobody hangin' 'round my doorstep
Ain't got no loose change just a-hangin' 'round my jeans
If you see somebody, would you send em' over my way?
I could use some help here with a can of pork and beans

I once had a family but they up and left me
With nothing but an 8-track, another side of George Jones
I was in high cotton, just a-bangin' on my six-string
A-kickin' at the trash can, walkin' skin and bone

I can see your back porch
If I close my eyes now
I can hear the train tracks through the laundry on the line
I'm thinking it's your business
But you don't got to answer
I'm knocking on your screen door
In the summertime

Everybody's out there
Climbin' on the trees now
Swinging in the breeze now,
Hanging on the vine
I'm dreamin' 'bout a sailboat
I don't need a fur coat
Underneath the dashboard
Got some sweet potato wine

I can see your back porch
if I close my eyes now
I can hear the train tracks through the laundry on the line
I'm thinking it's your business
But you don't got to answer
I'm knocking on your screen door
In the summertime
I'm knocking on your screen door
In the summertime
