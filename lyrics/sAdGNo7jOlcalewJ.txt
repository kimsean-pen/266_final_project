Dear Rodeo
I'd be lyin' if I tried to tell you I don't think about you
After all the miles and the wild nights that we've been through
Lord knows we had a few

And dear Rodeo
I'd like to say that I took the reins and rode away
No regrets, no left-unsaids
Just turn the page
Oh, but you know better, babe

'Tween the almost-had-'ems and broken bones
The dream of a buckle I'll never put on
I'm jaded
Woah, I hate it
But somehow the highs outweigh the lows
And I'll do it all again even though we both know
I'd still have to let you go

So dear Rodeo
I tried like hell to tell myself it was all your fault
I held on tight with all my might
I just couldn't hang on
And that's hard to hang your hat on

'Tween the almost-had-'ems and the broken bones
The dream of a buckle I'll never put on
I'm jaded
Woah, how I hate it
But somehow the highs outweigh the lows
And I'll do it all again even though we both know
I'd still have to let you go

Dear Rodeo
I'd like to think you miss me too
But I know you don't
Oh, but that don't change the past
And that don't change the truth
I'm still in love with you
Dear Rodeo
