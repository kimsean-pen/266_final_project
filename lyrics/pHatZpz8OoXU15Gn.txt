I rather shoot a woman than a man
I worry whether this is my last life
and girl, if you're listening
I'm sorry, I can't help it

oh Dana, oh Dana, come on

I'm forevermore fighting with Steven
we do our goo-goo-koos
but we know
overboard and down
and strung out twice

oh Dana, oh Dana, come on

we seldom know what things are
two illusions going very far

oh Dana, oh Dana, come on

I got busted across the bridge
they rounded up every soul
but now I'm on the East Side
she says,"don't give a girl a chance"
she's not afraid to take a chance
oh Dana, oh Dana, come on
she's got a magic wand
that says play with yourself
before other ones
oh Dana, oh Dana, come on, come on
oh, oh Dana, Dana come on
