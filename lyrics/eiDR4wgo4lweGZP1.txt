I'm a mess
She's all, long red hair
She's all, purple dress
And I'm like, she's so sweet
While I check to see
Where the foot prints lead screaming

Daphne please
Bend my knees
To be a bug beat
Beneath your feet

Ohhhh we're splitting up
Gonna catch some crooks

To tell you the truth
She's not a lot
But she's all the clues
I haven't got
My god
What if something happened to her?
I couldn't even explain
You're watching me break up the gang

Thinking back
Was something in the way
She walked in, the way she walked in
Like, "oh I'm back"
Amongst goons and goblins
She said she came here often like

Daphne please
Bend my knees
To be a flea hiding deep
Within your fleece

Ohhhhh now we're splitting up
Gonna catch some crooks

To tell you the truth
She's not a lot
But she's all the friends
I haven't got
My god
What if something happened to her?
I couldn't even explain
She's watching me break up the gang

And I'm in her waist
When I feel the burning
Returning to my face
But in a way
It's the only damn thing
Thats been missing from my day
Cuz love in itself is an ill guided blade
Missing it's mark
It cuts straight through my veins
It's the tracks, the train
It's you in the way

My god
What if something happened to her?
I couldn't even explain
She's watching me break up the gang

My god
What if something happened to her?
I couldn't even explain
She's watching me break up the gang
