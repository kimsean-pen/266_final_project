When the lights go down in the city
Getting real low
Settling in my room, I'm unnoticed
When the still comes in through my window
Letting me go
I feel a calm come over me, on the floor

On the floor
Where the rats all come away clean, there on the floor
Where the children all stomped and screamed straight out the door
Well, I find myself on my knees
Begging please

When the lights go down in the city
And everyone goes
To their room, walking the trail to dreamland
When the lights go down in the city
Something is roaring
I find myself waiting to believe

On the floor
Where the mice call shots in the corner, that's where I'll be
When the crickets come home and sing their symphony
Well, I find myself on my knees
Begging please

On the floor
Facing the things I've done, here on the floor
Where the years have gathered and run, that's where I'll be
And I find myself on my knees
Begging please
