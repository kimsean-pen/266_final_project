annie knows when it's me
knows how I'm feeling
and gives me her healing
oh annie
sit down beside me
let me confide in you
you know when I'm blue
you know when I'm lonely
and honey I'm lonely
I'm going down
going down
going down

annie, daddy won't let me
daddy won't let me go
and that's why I feel so low
oh annie
sit down beside me
let me confide in you
you know when I'm blue
you know when I'm lonely
and honey I'm lonely
I'm going down
going down
going down
going down
