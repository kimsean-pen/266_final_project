I grew up in a small town
Used to look around
What am I gonna do to
Make my little mama proud?
She always said to me
"Oh, honey, you'll go far
Just listen to your heart
And you'll be the brightest star

Keep on fighting
Don't stop believing
Never give up on
What you're dreaming
Can you feel it?
Baby, I can you feel it

Keep on fighting,
Don't stop believing
Never give up on what you're dreaming
Can you feel it? Ooh

I'm gonna show you
What I'm capable of
Do what I want
This is where I stand
And this is who I am
No matter what they say
I'm gonna shine like a star
This is where I stand
And this is who I am
(Who I am)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
(Who I am)
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Some say
"You shouldn't"
Some say
"Go for it all"
Nothing can hold me back
I'll break through the wall

Keep on fighting
Don't stop believing
Never give up on
What you're dreaming
Can you feel it?
Baby, I can you feel it
Keep on fighting
Don't stop believing
Never give up on
What you're dreaming
Can you feel it?
Ooh

I'm gonna show you
What I'm capable of
Do what I want
This is where I stand
And this is who I am
No matter what they say
I'm gonna shine like a star
This is where I stand
And this is who I am
(Who I am) Ooh, ooh, ooh
(Who I am) Ooh, ooh, ooh (Who I am)
