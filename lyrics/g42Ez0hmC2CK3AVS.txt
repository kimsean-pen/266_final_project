My heart's on fire
You light me up and I can't cool down
Your love is wild
You're dangerous, you're dangerous

My heart's on fire
You light me up and I can't cool down
Your love is wild
You're dangerous, you're dangerous

Remember when you kissed me by the sea
You were saying all the things
that I'd like to believe
That you could give me all your love
You could give me just enough
And we could live in paradise
and never have to leave

But is it true?
Whenever I look around
I can always find you
By my side in the mornin' an' in the night
You're my ca-andy all the time

My heart's on fire
You light me up and I can't cool down
Your love is wild
You're dangerous, you're dangerous

I never knew a love like this
I never knew a love like this
Is it too good to be true? Ah, ah...
Am I dreamin' or is this love real? Ah, ah...

I like your style
I like your smile
Everything about you
When you're on time
I let you take me for a ride
We can go anywhere you want to

My heart's on fire (Ah, ah...)
You light me up and I can't cool down
Your love is wild (Ah, ah...)
You're dangerous, you're dangerous

Your style
I like your smile
Everything about you
When you're on time
I let you take me for a ride
We can go anywhere you want to
I never knew a love like this
I never knew a love like this
I never knew a love like this
I never knew a love like this
I never knew a love like this
Oh...
