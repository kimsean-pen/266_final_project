Just a little baby girl,
Didn't ask to get born into this crazy world
Sometimes life gets sloppy 'cause
I didn't even know who my daddy was
My mommy held me tight
Rocked me side to side as she sang a lullaby
Then my mommy cried and my mommy said goodbye
She brought me into this life
But I don't know why
Mommy didn't want me
Mommy didn't want me

Just a little baby girl,
Didn't ask to get born into this crazy world
Sometimes life gets sloppy 'cause
I didn't even know who my mommy was
Maybe I was born bad, maybe I need help
Cause sometimes I get sad and I wanna kill myself
But when I sing my momma's lullaby
And I wanna die but I don't know why, why
Mommy didn't want me, mommy didn't want me

[Verse 3: Yolandi]

Just a little baby girl,
didn't ask to get born into this crazy world
Sometimes life gets sloppy 'cause,
I didn't know who my mommy or my daddy was
They told me my mommy held me tight,
Rocked me side to side as she sung a lullaby
Then my mommy cried and my mommy said goodbye
She brought me into this life but I don't know why
Mommy didn't want me
