Down on the dream today
In the graveyard where I do my dreamin'
Tied my hair in braids
Yeah the colored pinwheels spinnin'

Smoking pipe
Thought I'd get away
But I can't go anywhere without my sun medallion

So I got into my car this morning
On the street where I do my livin'
She's a mean green chevrolet
Yeah I felt the engine turnin

Black coffee
Standard transmission
You know I can't go anywhere without my sun medallion

Somebody said to me
You know you got to take it or use it
So show me a path to the mountains
The color the sky will bring me

You know you got to do the dance
Let go of your body
[and with no doubt?]
I love you
