I heard your name
And I'll never be the same
I love you
Yes, I do
Now and forever
Please say you'll be
Just the only one for me
I love you
Yes, I do
Say you'll love me ever
Please say you'll be
Just the only one for me
I love you so
And I'll never let you go
I like to be
Just the only one you see
Say that you're mine
And you'll never let me go

I held your hand
And I heard the marching men
Just a thought of our lips
Touchin' one another
I want you so
I can hardly let you go
Please be mine for a time
Now and forever
Say that you'll be
The only one for me
I love you so
And I'll never let you go
Please hear my plea
Say you love me dearly
And that you'll mine
And you'll never tell me no

I fell in love
And the stars were above
I love you
I still do
Now and forever
Please say you'll be
Just the only one for me
I'll be true
Just for you
Just say you'll love me ever
Please hear my plea
When I say I love you really
I love to be
In your arms
A whole night trough
Don't go away
'Cause you know
I'll miss you dearly
I love to spend
Just all my time with you
I do

I'll hold you tight
And we'll dance
Through the night
In my arms
All your charms
Sparkling in the moonlight
Your lips were divine
And you said
That you'll be mine
I was yours for a time
And everything is alright
You'll be my love
And I'll be true to you
I'll kiss you tender
You'll say you love me too
Just hear my plea
And say you'll never leave me
I love you
I do
Now and forever more
Forever more
