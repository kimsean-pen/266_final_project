It's the fame that holds you in vain
But in your letter it's playing your game
It's so hard when love gets dark in the summertime
And I got a bird here in my ear
Telling me stories all made by fears who will come true
When you get old, just pray
And I just got it all from
Mr.Feeling wrong with money
And I'm gonna tell you one thing now
The last time infected me
The last time infected me
The last time infected me so good
The last time infected me
The last time infected me
The last time infected me so good
Now it's cold and you're always involved
Into this song all made by code
Isn't it sad? Oh, so sad when I've written it
A tutor of mine, cover over
Laying all sleeping in the sand
Isn't it hard when love gets hard in the summertime?
And I just got it all from
Mr.Feeling wrong with money
And I'm gonna tell you one thing now
The last time infected me
The last time infected me
The last time infected me so good
The last time infected me
The last time infected me
The last time infected me so good
Oh, so good, oh, so good, oh, so good
Oh, so good, oh, so good, oh, so good
