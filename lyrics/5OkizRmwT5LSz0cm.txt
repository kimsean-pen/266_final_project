Some friends, you left me hanging
In a room with a noose and a chair
You told me to stay put
And reminded me why I was there

Cold-blooded and misguided
You thought that this would be your best
Then you tried to hide it
A chance to move ahead

Today was the day
You tried to shut me down
Today was the day
You tried to shut me down

Be honest
Did you ever mention my name?
Did you get sick of the shame?
Did you lie on your back?
Be honest
Did you ever mention my name?
Did you get sick of the shame?
Did you lie on your back like a whore?

Close-minded with no direction
A chance to prove who you were
My friends, you forgot to think
Of all of the things that you're not

Today was the day
You tried to shut me down
Today was the day
You tried to shut me down
Today was the day
You tried to shut me down
Today was the day
You tried to shut me down

Be honest
Did you ever mention my name?
Did you get sick of the shame?
Did you lie on your back?
Be honest
Did you ever mention my name?
Did you get sick of the shame?
Did you lie on your back?
Be honest
Did you ever mention my name?
Did you get sick of the shame?
Did you lie on your back like a whore?
