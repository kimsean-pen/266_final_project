You're like a circus running through my mind
Got those sneaky eyes, what you trynna hide?
You're like a hurricane inside my veins
But I like it babe, so bring on the break

Let me fall, let me fall, baby let me drown
Can't breathe, can't breathe, give me mouth-to-mouth
Got my heartbeat pressing, that's slowing down
Got me sweating and I'm shaking, I'm freaking out

I took your love, think I took too much
Somebody call the doctor
Somebody call the doctor doctor (doctor)
I took it all, but it's not enough
Somebody call the doctor
Somebody call the doctor doctor (doctor)
Don't let don't let don't let don't let go
Don't let don't let don't let don't let go
Hold me tight, I'm coming down
I need your love and I need it now
Don't let don't let don't let don't let go
Don't let don't let don't let don't let go
Somebody call the doctor before I overdose

I'm getting crazy, going back and forth
Caught inside your storm
But I want some more
I hope your kisses and your gentle touch
Come on, keep me up 'cause I need the rush

Let me fall, let me fall, baby let me drown
Can't breathe, can't breathe, give me mouth-to-mouth
Got my heartbeat pressing, that's slowing down
Got me sweating and I'm shaking, I'm freaking out

I took your love, think I took too much
Somebody call the doctor
Somebody call the doctor doctor (doctor)
I took it all, but it's not enough
Somebody call the doctor
Somebody call the doctor doctor (doctor)
Don't let don't let don't let don't let go
Don't let don't let don't let don't let go
Hold me tight, I'm coming down
I need your love and I need it now
Don't let don't let don't let don't let go
Don't let don't let don't let don't let go
Somebody call the doctor before I overdose

Don't let me overdose, don't let me overdose
Don't let me overdose, don't let me overdose

I took your love, think I took too much
Somebody call the doctor
Somebody call the doctor doctor (doctor)
I took it all, but it's not enough
Somebody call the doctor
Somebody call the doctor doctor (doctor)
Don't let don't let don't let don't let go
Don't let don't let don't let don't let go
Hold me tight, I'm coming down
I need your love and I need it now
Don't let don't let don't let don't let go
Don't let don't let don't let don't let go
Somebody call the doctor before I overdose

I took your love, think I took too much
Somebody call the doctor
Somebody call the doctor doctor (doctor)
I took it all, but it's not enough
Somebody call the doctor
