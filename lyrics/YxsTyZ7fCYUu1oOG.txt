A naked eye conspires with fear
To form an idea
So destructive and insincere
Reared in the mind
Nut outside you'll find
That nature does not align
You see,
There's more variation withinpopulations than between populations
Ah for too many years
A myth perserveres
The scars and the sourvenirs
Defined by your skin
Forget we share kin
We're torn apart
It feels as though we're sinking
I don't know how we'll get to shore again
Sinkingm we'll surface through the waves
Look back to the past
We hail from one caste
This division will not last
Defined by your skin
Forget we share kin
We're torn apart
