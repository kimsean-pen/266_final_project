And when I look out my window, I see the leaves falling from the trees.
I see the Trashblow through the street.
I see a distant bolt of lightning.
I see the raindrops slowly start to fall.
I see the big cloud up above.
I see the way your body language changes when you realize I'm the one that you've been dreaming of.
When I walk out my front door, I feel the rain as it hits my face.
I see the broken flower vase.
I see the leather and the lace.
One last bird is flying to the tree; the water's weighing down its wings.
I see the way your body language changes.
I see the way you look at me and the pain it brings.
Can you feel the rain?
