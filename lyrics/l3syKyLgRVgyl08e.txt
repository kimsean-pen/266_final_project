oh my sweet nurse
pull the curtain aside for a while
so that I can for once have
the sun in my eye
you smile and say
it's a fine day

oh my sweet nurse
pull the curtain aside for a while

then like a ghost at night
you come around all dressed in white
talking to me
and so I have to drink
the water with your poison spilled
for no more will

oh my sweet nurse
seems you have so little time
that you rather put
me to sleep than sit by my side
