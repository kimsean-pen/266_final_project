Exile
It takes your mind
again
Exile
It takes your mind
again
You've got suckers' luck
Have you given up?
Does it feel like a trial?
Does it trouble your mind the way you trouble mine?

Exile
It takes your mind
again
Exile
It takes your mind
again
Oh, you meant so much
Have you given up?
Does it feel like a trial?
Does it trouble your mind the way you trouble mine?
Does it feel like a trial?
Now you're thinking too fast
You're like marbles on glass
Vilify
Don't even try
Vilify
Don't even try
You've got suckers' luck
Have you given up?
Does it feel like a trial?
Does it trouble your mind the way you trouble mine?
Does it feel like a trial?
Did you fall for the same empty answers again?

Vilify
Don't even try
Vilify
Don't even try
Vilify
Don't even try
