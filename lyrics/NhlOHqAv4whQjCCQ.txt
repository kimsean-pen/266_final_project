Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh Lord
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

I got fired from Old Navy
Landlord keeps on knocking
Swear that nigga hates me
Sleeping on this old couch
But shit, I'm not complaining
'Cause I'm still a pimp though
Like there's moulah raining

And I ain't never ever been this rich ever
I don't even make all that much dough
Ask my mama for a dub and raised her blood pressure
Now she got me working at the corner store

But I'm ballin', ballin'
I'm so fucking awesome
Vroom vroom, yeah
That's my Camry roaring
Shit, think the engine light came on
Now I gotta walk 15 miles to my apartment
Ballin', ballin', ballin'
I'm so mother, motherfucking awesome, yeah
Ballin', ballin', ballin'
Ballin', ballin', ballin'

Oh Lord
Yeah, yeah
Oh Lord

Gormet
Heart them ramen noodles
Freak it with the hot sauce
I do McDonalds too though
And when I wanna go out
Good Will gotta do though
Sweet talking the bouncers
18 bucks, I need 2 more

And I ain't never ever been this rich ever
I don't even make all that much dough
Ask my mama for a dub and raised her blood pressure
Now she got me working at the corner store

But I'm ballin', ballin'
I'm so fucking awesome
Vroom vroom, yeah
That's my Camry roaring
Shit, think the engine light came on
Now I gotta walk 15 miles to my apartment
Ballin', ballin', ballin'
I'm so mother, motherfucking awesome, yeah
Ballin', ballin', ballin'
Ballin', ballin', ballin'

Oh Lord

Jumped the gate, subway station
All the seats are taken
This kinda lifestyle teach you patience
I spend my very last savings on some Takis
I'm good at simbis crib
I don't need no hotel lobbies
I doubt I'd get along with paparazzi, yeah
I just want a Slim Jim and a 40
I just wanna roll up to the sundown without my moms throwing a fit
I just wanna party in New York in all the abandon warehouses
With the hipster kids and the bad bitches with hair on their armpits
We wear designer clothes from thrifts
My hair might not be laid and did

Yeah, but I'm ballin', ballin'
I'm so fucking awesome
Vroom vroom, yeah
That's my Camry roaring
Shit, think the engine light came on
Now I gotta walk 15 miles to my apartment
Ballin', ballin', ballin'
I'm so mother, motherfucking awesome, yeah
Ballin', ballin', ballin'
Ballin', ballin', ballin'

Oh Lord
