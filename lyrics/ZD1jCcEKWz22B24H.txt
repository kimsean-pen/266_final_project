I'm just enough, to make you smile
When you need me, to hold you close
All your fears, that you dream of
Will disappear and flutter off

Hold on just a little
We'll meet right here in the middle ground
Is where we'll stand
Let go of the brittle
'Cause you'll find life is a riddle
That we're not meant to understand

Hold on you said

Just look up and I'll look down
And all your fears have ran aground
Then you said...

All I ever wanted was to love like this
All I ever needed was to feel like something more
Than a closed door flat on the floor
I can offer so much more
All I ever wanted was to feel at ease
All I ever needed was to get up off my feet
'Cause I believe in love
Hold on just a little
We'll meet right here in the middle ground
Is where we'll stand
Let go of the brittle
'Cause you'll find life is a riddle
That we're not meant to understand

Hold on you said
