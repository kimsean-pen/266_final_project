It's just like a battle zone
You got a bottle, now you're on your own
Gotta be a scotch or a kamikaze
None of those other weapons will faze me

First of the last calls
It's in your heart, it's in your mind
First of the last calls
Cashing it in before your time

Hundred, hundred, hundred bottles on the wall
You wonder if you can drink them all
Gotta go home at 1 a.m.
The bottle wins the battle again

First of the last calls
It's in your heart, it's in your mind
First of the last calls
Cashing it in before your time

Just talking with you

First of the last calls
It's in your heart, it's in your mind
First of the last calls
Cashing it in before another time

The first of the last, first of the last
First of the last calls in your life
First of the last, first of the last
First of the last calls in your life

First of the last, first of the last
First of the last calls in your life
First of the last, first of the last
First of the last calls in your life
