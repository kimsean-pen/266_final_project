I'll never be the bravest of us
Crossing my fingers whenever I cross
I wish I could love without having to fear
Baby's fingers gotta burn, baby came to near

You'll never know all the trouble I've got
Still haven't slept in at seven o'clock
Everything I have I could lose within this fight
Somebody gotta tell me that I'm gonna be alright

Always crazy
It's crazy up in here
I'm inside my head
How do I get out of it

Always cra-a-zy
It's crazy up in here
I'm inside my head
How do I get out of it

And then he said: Honey
And then she said: Hone-ey
And then he said: Honey
You're on your own, you're on your own, own, own, own

(ha-ha, ha-a-a-a - ha-ha)
(ha-a-a-a - ha-ha, ha-a-a-a - ha-ha, ha-a-a-a)

Searchin' for sunlight or winter inside
Thinking of circles I cannot abide
Baby, make me want for the snow inside of me

All will flow in, in my eyes, turn into a sea
I'll never know what I'm capable of
If I don't go where I'm scared to be lost
Hope will find my way when I'm going through the night

Somebody gotta tell me that I'm gonna be alright
Always crazy
It's crazy up in here
I'm inside my head

How do I get out of it
Always cra-a-zy
It's crazy up in here
I'm inside my head

How do I get out of it
Hu, u-hu-uh, u-hu-uh, u-hu-u-u-uh
Hu, u-hu-uh, u-hu-uh, u-hu-u-hu-u

Hu, u-hu-uh, u-hu-uh, u-hu-u-u-uh
Hu, u-hu-uh, u-hu-uh, u-hu-u- hu-u

Huuuuuuuu
Always crazy
It's crazy up in here

I'm inside my head
How do I get out of it
Always cra-a-zy
It's crazy up in here
I'm inside my head
How do I get out of it

And then he said: Honey
And then she said: Hone-ey
And then he said: Honey
You're on your own, you're on your own, own, own, own
