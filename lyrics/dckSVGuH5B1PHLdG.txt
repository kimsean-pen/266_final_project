Forgive me Lord

Please, those years when I ignored You, hmm
Forgive them Lord
Those that feel they can't afford You, hmm
Help me Lord, please

To rise above this dealing, hmm
Help me Lord, please
To love You with more feeling, hmm
At both ends of the road

To the left and the right
Above and below us
Out and in, there's no place that You're not in
Oh, won't you hear me Lord
(Hear me Lord)

(Hear me Lord)
(Hear me Lord)
(Hear me Lord)
At both ends of the road

To the left and the right
Above and below us
Out and in, there's no place that You're not in
Oh, won't you hear me Lord
Help me Lord, please

To rise a little higher, hmm
Help me Lord, please
To burn out this desire, hmm
Hear me Lord, please

Hear me Lord, please
Oh, won't You please, please

Hear me Lord
Oh, hear me Lord
Hear me Lord
Oh, won't you please, please
Hear me Lord
My Lord, my Lord, my Lord
(Hear me Lord)
Now, won't You please (hear me Lord)
My Lord, my Lord, my Lord
Won't You please / (Hear me Lord)
Oh, hear me Lord, hear me Lord
(Hear me Lord)
