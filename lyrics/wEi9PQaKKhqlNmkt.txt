Well my, throat is dry
and my knees are weak
so darned hot
can't even speak
Walk in my shadows
I can't take it anymore
When I get you in my shadow, baby
I'm gonna give you what's in store

Yes I know baby
That's a shady kind of deal
I just want to find out
How you feel
Walk in my shadow
I ain't gonna take it anymore
When I get you in the shadow
I'm gonna give you what's in store

Yes I know you think I'm stupid
just wouldn't be cool
I can tell you baby
I aint no fool
Walk in my shadow
I can't take it anymore
When I get you in my shadow
I'm gonna give you what's in store

When I get you in my shadow
I'm gonna give you what's in store
Yeah, I'm gonna give you what's in store
