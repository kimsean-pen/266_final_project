(Egan)

Woke up this morning, I got out of bed,
Too late to go to work â€” walked my dog instead.
I don't try too hard, but I get by.

You don't have to tell me I've got a lot to learn,
Think I gotta laugh at your overconcern.
I don't try too hard, but I get by.

You sit there with your fancy cigar and you think, "I got it made",
I don't want no fast car, whoa no.

I'm never ready, don't have to wait,
Everybody knows I'm bound to get there late.
I don't try too hard, but I get by.

You sit there with your fancy cigar and you think, "I got it made",
I don't want no fast car, whoa no.

I'm never ready, don't have to wait,
Everybody knows I'm bound to get there late.
I don't try too hard, but I get by.
