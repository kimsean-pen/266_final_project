Come
Approach
My trusty jackal's nose
Don't try to lie
Cause I can smell your hide

Leave your body
Leave this body now
Your face can stay
Upon this golden mask you made

The brave in heart
Can claim eternal life
My scales of truth
Will need sufficient proof

Their balance depends
On how your soul weights
To walk with Gods
The jaws of chaos you must pass

Anubis
My soul is so light
And as this feather I can fly

Anubis
Don't let me wither and die

I am proud for what I am
The guardian of the dead
Appointed by the gods
To be their final judge

Anubis
Don't let me wither and die
