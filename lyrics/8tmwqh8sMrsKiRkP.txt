Watch it blow my mind
It's something I am ill-prepared to remedy
But let it slow the time
It takes to die and close your eyes to your enemy
Defy!

Self-made millionaires won't take ideas
From all the little plebeians just suffocate with smiles
And force fed lies
And close your mind to reality
Deny!

It feels like I'm losing again
When I've lost everything
I'm sure I will see more clearly
Lose what I'm feeling to them
And not feeling anything
I'm sure I will bleed sincerely
Tonight!

Watch it blow my mind
It's something I am ill-prepared to remedy
But let it slow the time
It takes to die and close your eyes to your enemy
Defy!

It feels like I'm losing again
When I've lost everything
I'm sure I will see more clearly
Lose what I'm feeling to them
And not feeling anything
I'm sure I will bleed sincerely
Tonight

So you make the simplest mistake
So you make the simplest mistake
And fearlessly you deny your involvement in my demise
But give me your open hand

It feels like I'm losing again
When I've lost everything
I'm sure I will see more clearly
Lose what I'm feeling to them
And not feeling anything
I'm sure I will bleed sincerely
Tonight!
