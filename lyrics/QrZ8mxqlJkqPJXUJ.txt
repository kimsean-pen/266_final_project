I keep my days open for sleeping in
I'll keep my days open for sleeping in
A late night phone call
From someone you don't miss
You keep them alive with simple small talk shit

Uncomfortably honest, and honestly lonely
Got somewhere to be
Hey man, don't worry about me
The city stopped moving
I'm alone with my secrets
I could probably hang myself with the curtains

This is the portrait of a man
More than coffee in his hand
Front row seats to old repeats, of a highlight reel for years, yeah
And all the things I never said
I'm doing circles in my head
I'm counting sheep, with no relief
Just another night alone, yeah

I keep my days open for sleeping in
I'll keep my days open for sleeping in
A late night phone call
From someone you don't miss
You keep them alive with simple small talk shit

Please don't let me leave the world tonight
I'll wait by your driveway in case you change your mind
We can keep drinking 'til it feels alright
You know we don't have to talk, we could just be alive
Please don't let me leave on my own tonight
You know I'll wait by your driveway in case you change your mind
And we can keep drinking 'til it feels alright
You know we don't have to talk we could just be alive

I keep my days open for sleeping in
I'll keep my days open for sleeping in

This is the portrait of a man
More than coffee in his hand
Front row seats to all the peaks and the highlight reel for years, yeah
And all the things I never said
I'm doing circles in my head
I'm counting sheep, with no relief
Just another night on my own
