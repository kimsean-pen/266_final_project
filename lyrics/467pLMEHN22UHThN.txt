How are you even performing
With broken voice and shattered spine
It's soul to soul inside my head
It's you and you versus I and I

And if you really adored me
You'd cut me up with razor wire
You'd call me passionately again
And never say you were too tired

And she knows I keep secrets
And secrets kept me on my own
But I just started working again
So both of us are never home

The week I went to L.A.
I couldn't help but feel alone
Then on the weekend leave again
So I can shoot the video...

Do you like being normal and do I annoy you all the time?
Feels like I've nothing left to give but to leave you unsatisfied
Or maybe I just bore you.
It leaves me wondering again...
In after life there's only death...
Beyond the smoke that's in my chest
Beyond the stress only more stress
