take in,
repulse,
search for the oxygen
it comes and goes like the promise of addiction
suppress and explode,
reload the pain into passion
pull the verve from the hurt, and evolve through destruction

something itches
something begs to break the form
splint the elbow,
break the cheek on the palm
look at these eyes blur and gaze out the panes
I see something you don't
I see something that you can't

no medicine
no remedy
no paradise eternity
embrace the human form
enter the errorzone

in this spiral of depress and desire,
I want to erase myself and set this world on fire

so far I see something more
I reach out and touch but,
it's out of my hands
it's out of my head
