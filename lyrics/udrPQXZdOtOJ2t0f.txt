This that lo-fi, $uicide
Dreams of when I die
Blood red tears when I cry
Manic depression in my eyes
Player from the 80's
Crack cocaine done raised
Lucifer done saved me
Satan's son in a Mercedes
$uicide for life
Until I rot and decay
I'm hearing "kill them all"
With every word that I say
This my inauguration day to come up out of my grave
Resurected by the demon, Antoine De Mone'
But, let's get deeper
Got some bitches and a beeper
Soul seeker, I'm the fucking devil's Aaron Neville
I got a soul to sell but it's settled
Last week I sold my soul for a fucking bezel
Crucify me...

Crucify me wearing Tommy
All black with the goons behind me
Lurking, searching for that blood to spill
Pop them pills and sip that barre
Gut that blunt and light that gar, I'm smoking till the death
Pop them bars and fuck that broad, I'm searching for what's next

Put me in a fucking Polo bodybag
Don't be jealous everybody wanting what Oddy have
Shotty blast
Put that Tommy back and grab the Gucci
Uzi spraying through me
No my life ain't like no mother fucking movie
Yeah, it's more like a confession tape
Tape her confession, take off her dress and watch her fucking faint
Pretty girl sacrifice
Ugly hoe in the back on ice
Lit a match cause the gas was asking twice
Slash and slice I'm passing lice
Snatching ice and casting dice
Luck of the draw
Stuffing with straw until I choke and I clog
Yeah I'm cuffing myself bitch to Lucifer's claw
Suit and a saw
Killing yourself is just business
Please don't take it personal
In my hell it's snowing, bitch
I'm watching winter fall

Crucify me wearing Tommy
All black with the goons behind me
Lurking, searching for that blood to spill
Pop them pills and sip that barre
Gut that blunt and light that gar, I'm smoking till the death
Pop them bars and fuck that broad, I'm searching for what's next

Crucify me wearing Tommy
All black with the goons behind me
Lurking, searching for that blood to spill
Pop them pills and sip that barre
Gut that blunt and light that gar, I'm smoking till the death
Pop them bars and fuck that broad, I'm searching for what's next
