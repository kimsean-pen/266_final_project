Woah, ohh
Woah, ohh
Woah, ohh
Woah, hmm

She's staring at me
I'm sitting wondering what she's thinking
Hmm, nobody's talking
'Cause talking just turns into screaming

And now is I'm yelling over her
She yelling over me
All that that means
Is neither of us is listening
(And what's even worse?)
That we don't even remember why were fighting

So both of us are mad for nothing
Fighting for nothing
(Crying for) nothing
But we won't let it go for nothing
(No not for) nothing
This should be nothing
To a love like what we got

Oh, baby, I know sometimes
It's gonna rain
But baby, can we make up now?
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain
(Can't sleep through the pain)

Girl, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you to go to bed
(Mad at me)
No, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you to go to bed
(Mad at me) Oh no, no, no

And it gets me upset
Girl, when you're constantly accusing
(Asking questions like you already know)
We're fighting this war
Baby, when both of us are losing
(This ain't the way that love is supposed to go)

(What happened to working it out?)
We've felled into this place
Where you ain't backing down
And I ain't backing down
So, what the hell do we do now?

It's all for nothing
(Fighting for) nothing
(Crying for) nothing
But we won't let it go for nothing
(No not for) nothing
This should be nothing
To a love like what we got

Oh, baby, I know sometimes
It's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
But baby, can we make up now
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain
(Oh, can't sleep through the pain)

Girl, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you to go to bed
(Mad at me)
No, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you to go to bed
(Mad at me) Oh no, no, no

Oh, baby, this love ain't gonna be perfect
(Perfect, oh)
And just how good it's gonna be?
We can fuss, and we can fight
Long as everything all right between us
Before we go to sleep
Baby, we're gonna be happy

Baby, I know sometimes
It's gonna rain
But baby, can we make up now
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain
(Can't sleep through the pain)

Girl, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you to go to bed
(Mad at me)
No, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you to go to bed
(Mad at me) Oh no, no, no
