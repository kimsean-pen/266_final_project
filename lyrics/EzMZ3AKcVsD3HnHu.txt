Clouds of fear
Roved the sky as the enemies
Chased the sun away from their land
Blacked, got, the snow
As the footsteps by enemies
Chased the peace away
From their land

Hope and light,
The Snow Lion brings
Through wisdom
Hate and lies,
Dragon infuses into freedom

The land of snow
Being invaded by enemies
Shrines and beauties dressed up in ruins
One can't believe
Any words said by enemies
Cultural invasion begins

Suspicious walls
Prison of glass
Freedom is now stuck
Behind the bars of past

Curse... uprising curse
Enemies of compassions
Despotic thirst

Waves of hate... undertowed
Tragic fate... sinking
Waves of hate... undertowed
Mourning braves... drowning
