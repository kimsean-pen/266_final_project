In the arms of night
Laid corpses with forces drained
They strived to live
Celestial bodies scattered
A final breath of sulfur

Planets that rule the abyss
The architects behind this carnage
They are black holes in the sky
Predators lurking as spiders

Whirpools that cannot be seen
Are sucking the dark oceans dry
Victors in these killing fields
Crushing the essence of others

War in Heaven...

Planets that rule the abyss
The architects behind this carnage
They are black holes in the sky
Predators lurking as spiders

Whirpools that cannot be seen
Are sucking the dark oceans dry
Victors in these killing fields
Crushing the essence of others

Fighters
Battalions turned to ashes
Dark Suns
Event horizon masters
Fighters
They clash with ruthless violence
Dark Suns
The mighty atom smashers
