Before I met you, I never felt good enough
Before I let you, in, I'd already given up
Left on read, no reply, left me just wondering why
Now I'm skeptical of love

So when you hold my hand, do you wanna hold my heart?
When you say you want me, is it all of me or just one part?
So when you hold my hand, do you wanna hold my heart?
When you say you want me

Momma said there'd be boys like you
Tearing my heart in two, doing what you do, best
Taking me for a ride, telling me pretty little lies
But with you, I can't resist

I'm terrified, but I'll never let you know
Social suicide, if I ever let it show
Everything feels just right
I fall in place, we fall in line
I'll never let you go

So when you hold my hand, do you wanna hold my heart?
When you say you want me, is it all of me or just one part?
So when you hold my hand, do you wanna hold my heart?
When you say you want me
Is it all of me? yeah

Momma said there'd be boys like you
Tearing my heart in two, doing what you do, best
Taking me for a ride, telling me pretty little lies
But with you, I can't resist

So when you hold me, am I the only one?
Do you wanna know me, or is this all just for fun?

Momma said there'd be boys like you
Tearing my heart in two, doing what you do, best
Taking me for a ride, telling me pretty little lies
But with you, I can't resist
Maybe momma doesn't always know best

Momma said there'd be boys like you
Too good to be true, doing what you do, best
Taking me for a ride, telling me pretty little lies
But for you, for you, for you I'll take that risk
