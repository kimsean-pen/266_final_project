Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn
Burnin'

To my surprise, listen
One hundred stories high
People gettin' loose y'all
Gettin' down on the roof, do you hear?
The folks was flaming

Out of control
It was so entertainin'
When the boogie started to explode
I heard somebody say
Burn baby burn, disco inferno

Burn baby burn, burn that mother down
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn that mother down
Burnin'
Satisfaction uh uh uhh
Came in the chain reaction
(Burnin')

I couldn't get enough
Till I had to self-destruct
The heat was on
(Burnin')
Rising to the top

Everybody's goin' strong
And that is when my spark got hot

I heard somebody say
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn that mother down, yo
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn that mother down
Burnin'

Up above my head, I hear music in the air
I hear music
That makes me know
There's a party somewhere
Satisfaction

Came in a chain reaction, do you hear?
I couldn't get enough
So I had to self destruct
The heat was on

Rising to the top
Everybody's goin' strong
That is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn that mother down
Burn baby burn, disco inferno, yeah
Burn baby burn, burn that mother down
Get it
Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn that mother down
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn.
