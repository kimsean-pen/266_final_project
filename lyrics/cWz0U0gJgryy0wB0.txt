What if we were sixteen again?
Parties never had to end
Life was always like a vacation
Building castles in the sand
Showing off why we were stand
All day long be cruisin' naked
And in the summer vibe

We'd be cruisin'
We ain't got nowhere to go
Only thing we know is
We're cruisin'
Running free on our night time
Every day and night
We'd be cruisin'
We'd be cruisin'

Cannonballs into the sea
Everything is make believe
Carousel in underneath rainbows
We're swinging from tree to tree
Ever after happily
Frolicking wherever the sun goes
And in the summer vibe

We'd be cruisin'
We ain't got nowhere to go
Only thing we know is
We're cruisin'
Running free on our night time
Every day and night
We'd be cruisin'
We'd be cruisin'

Take the stars and never let
Get lost and don't come back again
You'll be cru'sin'
We ain't got nowhere to go
Only thing we know is
We're cruisin'
Running free on our night time
Every day and night
We'd be cruisin'
We'd be cruisin'
