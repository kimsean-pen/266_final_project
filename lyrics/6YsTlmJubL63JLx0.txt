It's been a long time waiting
Been a long time waiting on you, on you
I've got a lot of love riding
I've got a lot of love riding on you, on you

You tell me I can do what I wanna do
You tell me I can be who I wanna be
You let me here, don't let me down

I need you my heart, so take it
Should use my head, no time to play it
I don't have time to change it
I wanna know what's going on

Are you gonna tell me what I do to you?
Can I zip it? Relax?
Watch the world go by and know that we got it
Tell me what I do to you
Can I zip it? Relax?
Watch the world go by and know that we got it

You're the one that I believe in
So don't give me no reason to die, oh no
You're the one that I invest in
Every minute of every hour

You tell me I'll be safe standing next to you
You tell me you need me like I need you
You let me here, don't let me down

I need you my heart, so take it
Should use my head, no time to play it
I don't have time to change it
I wanna know what's going on

Are you gonna tell me what I do to you?
Can I zip it? Relax?
Watch the world go by and know that we got it
Tell me what I do to you
Can I zip it? Relax?
Watch the world go by

We, we've been walking too long
It's time we get it in the morning
You say we got it, I'm know we got it
Baby, you're the one
You talk about it going wrong
But this is where we belong
You say we got it, I'm know we got it
Baby, yeah

I need you my heart, so take it
Should use my head, no time to play it
I don't have time to change it
I wanna know what's going on

Are you gonna tell me what I do to you?
Can I zip it? Relax?
Watch the world go by and know that we got it
Tell me what I do to you
Can I zip it? Relax?
Watch the world go by and know that got it
