Tryna get a grip of the situation
Going far too deep in the conversation

Like I want ya
Like I need ya
There's a feeling
When I see ya
That makes me wanna hide away

Every second when you're near me
Every moment when you hear me
I think of every word I say
Yeah!

You look at me
I look at you
Ain't nothing gonna happen

But still I'm here
All into you
All waiting for reaction

Oohhhhh
Like I love you
Like I love you

Yeah!

Tryna walk the line without falling under
I'm holding on so hard cause I've felt the thunder

Oh oh oh yeah!
