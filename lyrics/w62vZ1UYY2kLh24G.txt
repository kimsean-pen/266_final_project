Crowding my every dream
There is your face before me
You are my only theme
It doesn't matter where you are
I can see how fair you are
I close my eyes and there you are
Always
If you could share the magic
If you could see me too
There would be nothing tragic
In all my dreams of you
Would that my love could haunt you so
Knowing I want you so
I can't erase
Your beautiful face before me.

Would that my love could haunt you so
Knowing I want you so
I can't erase
Your beautiful face before me.
