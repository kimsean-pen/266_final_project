What brought me in here in the morning
My heart looked bent please
Don't tell my parents
My friend says you don't wanna
Know who you are
When it comes down to it

I got an
Uncle, knocked out
A bear with a frying pan
His wife is his best friend
Nobody else ever sees him
Except in September
For one weekend
That's how it's done done

In the Pocono mountains
In the sixties
Fathers in station wagons
Cut the corners hard
Past broken firs
Burned stark and the only
Shapes moving were the ghostly forms of cattle
Walking in the dark
Moving

One whole family used to
Sleep upon this floor from the
Kitchen to the door
Elvis never gave
Elvis never gave an encore
Greater than my love
Gone out the door
The love that I've ignored

Elvis, Elvis never gave an encore
Meteor Meteor
Make me young
Make me young
Meteor Meteor
Make me young
Make me Meteor
Meteor Meteor
Make me young
