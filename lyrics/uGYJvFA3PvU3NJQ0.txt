She don't need no one, she runs the world
She got that lightning, come strike me, girl
Call out to her, she don't hear a word (oh)
See how she plays up to the lens
She pretends it's her only friend
No, it don't tell her any lies
Satisfies, but I can't catch her eye (oh)

She love lookin' at herself
And she don't need no one else
Yeah, she's in love, she's in love with a camera
She just wanna get that shot
If I'm in or if I'm not
She doesn't care, she's in love with a camera

She love lookin' at herself
And she don't need no one else
Yeah, she's in love, she's in love with a camera
Ooh, girl, when you love yourself
I don't want nobody else
She doesn't care, she's in love with a camera

She keeps me waiting, but I don't mind
Makes sure the light's hitting on her good side
Anxious the flash that will knock me blind (oh)
See how she plays up to the lens
She pretends it's her only friend
No, it don't tell her any lies
Satisfies, but I can't catch her eye (oh)

She love lookin' at herself
And she don't need no one else
Yeah, she's in love, she's in love with a camera
She just wanna get that shot
If I'm in or if I'm not
She doesn't care, she's in love with a camera

She love lookin' at herself
And she don't need no one else
Yeah, she's in love, she's in love with a camera
Ooh, girl, when you love yourself
I don't want nobody else
She doesn't care, she's in love with a camera

Oh
Ooh, yeah
Gonna show you
In time, you will be mine
Will be mine, you will be mine
You will be mine

She love lookin' at herself
And she don't need no one else
She just wanna get that shot
If I'm in or if I'm not
She doesn't care, she's in love with a camera

She love lookin' at herself
And she don't need no one else
Yeah, she's in love, she's in love with a camera
Ooh, girl, when you love yourself
I don't want nobody else
She doesn't care, she's in love with a camera
(Oh, what about me?)
Yeah, she's in love, she's in love with a camera
(What about me?)
She doesn't care, she's in love with a camera
