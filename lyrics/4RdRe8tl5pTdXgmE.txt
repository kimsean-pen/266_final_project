You say the ride is over
You want to leave the road behind
Till the day you walked away
You made the world be all mine

I'll be cool 'though it gets colder and colder
I'll be fine cause it's not over

Cause my dreams are all blind
They take me back to our time
And make you be mine only
Let me leave tears behind
I cry them only for you
And make you be mine only

All the finest moments
Should come back to where they were
My eyes they can't find someone else
They only want you to be mine

I'll be cool 'though it gets colder and colder
I'll be fine cause it's not over

Cause my dreams are all blind
They take me back to our time
And make you be mine only
Let me leave tears behind
I cry them only for you
And make you be mine only
