Keep holding on to everything
That's how it was?
Keep holding on to everything
Reflecting on yourself with them

I don't wanna fall too far from you
If you wanna be the one to go
Everybody wants to take something home

In the Summersun I can't reveal
We go on and on
In the Summersun I will conceal
We go on and on

In the Summersun I can't reveal
We go on and on
In the Summersun I will conceal
We go on and on

on-oh-ah and on and on and on
on-oh-ah, on and on and on
on-oh-ah and on and on and on
on-oh-ah, on and on and on

In the Summersun I can't reveal
We go on and on
In the Summersun I will conceal
We go on and on

In the Summersun I can't reveal
We go on and on
In the Summersun I will conceal
We go on and on

Ooh its (never worked with fireworks?)
today (the field has sang again?)
But you're something so faint
And I don't want the seasons (to) change again

Keep holding on to everything
That's how it was?
Keep holding on to everything
Reflecting on yourself with them

I don't wanna fall too far from you
If you wanna be the one to go
Everybody wants to take something home

on-oh-ah and on and on and on
on-oh-ah, on and on and on
on-oh-ah and on and on and on
on-oh-ah, on and on and on

In the Summersun I can't reveal
We go on and on
In the Summersun I will conceal
We go on and on

In the Summersun I can't reveal
We go on and on
In the Summersun I will conceal
We go on and on

on and on and on
on and on and on (everything's changed again)
on and on and on (and everything's changed again)
on and on and on
