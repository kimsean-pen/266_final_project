My sun is raining on me
And he, ain't a patient man
Go and get the sheriff
Tell him anything you can
(Just get him here)

Burned myself on this cast iron panhandle
Long before you came
Love was never the subject
(Couldn't talk about my mother to him)

Remember seeing Shirley in the oil fountain?
What a woman dancing!
I just wanted a happy ending
(For your little sister wherever she is)

Don't be so sad just cause you lost who you are
Man, man, man, cause none of this is gonna happen
To me, none of this is gonna happen to
None of this is gonna happen to me
None of this is gonna happen to me
Within my lifetime

Aren't you sick to death of the word inheritance?
It's with your great grandparents
You've inherited the wind, fool
I hope you enjoy it

But I'm going out flipping the bird to California--
Keep your melting stars!
I followed all the rules
I wasn't the one who turned the screw so hard

We have a great mountain coming, coming
But none of this is gonna happen to me
None of this is gonna happen to me
None of this is gonna happen to me
Within my lifetime

None of this is gonna happen to me
None of this is gonna happen to me
None of this is gonna happen to me
Within my lifetime
