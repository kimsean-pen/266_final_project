I got that xanax flowing through my blood stream
Bought them opiates to share with the team
Got that tuss on me and i got the lean
Molly in the water dance like selene
Roxy/oxy bout to go up my nose
Mix it with adderall
Mix it with the coke
Im a fiend i could never give up dope
I fucks with drugs i never fucks with these hoes
Roll that dope

Yung $now so froze
No hoes
Glowing like a lightbulb with the glass fucking broken
Night falls
I crawl on my fucking toes and leaders in
Christ might put on their motherfucking robes
Then pull up packing O's
Blackened O's in the back of their throat
Told em that i hope you choke
But you know how it goes
Bitch i feel so low
I feel so solo
Hoe lay low
