how does the world perceive me perceiving myself?
all i care to do is sip on beer and chocolate milk
i'm frightened more than usual, lately
i do not translate into
'one of the boys'
'lotus flower'
or 'chinita'
i'm just ES and i'd prolly rather
nap than wonder, restlessly:
will ya ever be impressed by me?
mom doesn't think i fit into the
darling archetype, but
that's an ancient pair of jeans
and my thighs are
crafted
holy,
rolling thunder
forget the numbers
forget the numbers, please

every goddamn family reunion,

someone's got somethin' to say
how didja become this way?

as if i've made a mistake
meanwhile, they've slaughtered the cake
