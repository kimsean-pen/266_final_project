I've heard the cry
Of a dying sun
Fading with the grey
Resembling a last goodbye
To a better yesterday

Just give me hope
Give me truth
Give me love
And give me life
In all the colourless nights

When lights fall
Collapse from high above
You and me
Will be fading with the grey

I am the white
I am the black
I am the grey
I am void
Yet I am everything...

"The rain, the promise, the new
Washing away the old and dusty
Billions of droplets from the sky
Like billions of people
Falling through their own existence
Trying to forget that they are born to die"

Under a hopeless sky
Yearning for answers
But the void remains cold

Numbness
Shattered glass
Pieces of my past
Fading with the grey
Fading with the grey
Fading with the grey
Fading with the grey
