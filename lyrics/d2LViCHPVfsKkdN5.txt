On the highway
Thirty people lost their lives
On the highway
Thirty people lost their lives
Well, I had some words to holler
And my Rosie took a ride

In the moonlight
See the Greyhound rollin' on
In the moonlight
See the Greyhound rollin' on
Flyin' through the crossroads
Rosie ran into the Hound

For the graveyard
Thirty boxes made of bone
For the graveyard
Thirty boxes made of bone
Oh, Mister Undertaker
Take this coffin from my home

In the midnight
Hear me cryin' out her name
In the midnight
Hear me cryin' out her name
But I'm a-standin' on the railroad
Waitin' for the graveyard train

On the highway
Thirty people turned to stone
On the highway
Thirty people turned to stone
Oh, take me to the station
'Cause I'm number thirty-one
