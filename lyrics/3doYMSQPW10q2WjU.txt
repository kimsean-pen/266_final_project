I stare at you
but I'm spaced out in a vacant space
Oh I swear I bet you we're burnt out like a fireplace
I stare at you but I'm spaced out in a vacant space
Oh I swear I bet you we're burnt out like a fireplace
절대 영원히가 영원히가 아니게 되었네
절대 너만을이 너만을이 아니게 되었네
OOH AH OOH AH OOH
Love you say OOH AH OOH AH OOH Love you
say 절대 영원히가 영원히가 아니게
절대 너만을이 너만을이 아니게
잠깐만 hold me closer than you did
last time I was just another fleeting high
Me hands dem They fall to my side Me hands dem
They move when I cry
If I had to tell you for a moment
That I loved you If I had to tell you for a moment
That I crushed you If I had to tell you for a moment
That we're losing Would your grip on me
Tighten or loosen I don't ever want to know
where you go when my guard's down I don't
want you wrapped around my arms
Now Can you pretend to be who I had wanted?
I couldn't give you up I couldn't even choose this
I Couldn't I couldn't even
choose this I couldn't I couldn't
even choose this I couldn't I couldn't even choose this
Who am I if I don't sacrifice for her
I don't want I don't want sadness no more
You don't need to be crucified hold on
Baby hold on Baby hold on
We can make it love we can make it forever
우리가 사는 곳 우주에 있고 우주엔 사람 있고
사람은 생각을 하고 생각은 전환을 하고
전화를 하고 우린 전화를 하고 진심을 말하고
진심은 설득을 하고 우린 진심을 말하고
말하고 또 말하고 또 말하고 또 말하고
Why can't you take my love
Why don't you take my love
Why don't you take my love
Why don't you take my love
절대 영원히가 영원히가 아니게
되었네 I don't want you wrapped around my arms now
절대 영원히가 영원히가 아니게
절대 너만을이 너만을이 아니게
