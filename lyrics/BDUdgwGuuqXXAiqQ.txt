You're never going to see what you like
You're never going to wake up and change your mind
You're never going to keep what you hold
You won't accomplish anything on your own

You can't have what you wanted
You can't have what you wanted
You can't have what you wanted
You can't have what you wanted
So make up your mind, come to your senses

You'll never win if you don't bend
It's not so complicated
If you decide to change your mind
You'll find your inundated

You're never going to do what you say
You'll always try to make up another way
You're never going to act on your own
You're never going to see that you're all alone

You can't have what you wanted
You can't have what you wanted
You can't have what you wanted
You can't have what you wanted
So make up your mind, come to your senses

You'll never win if you don't bend
It's not so complicated
If you decide to change your mind
You'll find your inundated

And so you're here and you don't know
If you can choose the way to go
It's not about the way it is
Don't become a realist

You've got time to make a choice
Don't think aloud but have a voice
And when you think the time is right
Don't ever be afraid to fight

You'll never win if you don't bend
It's not so complicated
If you decide to change your mind
You'll find your inundated

You'll never win if you don't bend
It's not so complicated
If you decide to change your mind
You'll find your inundated

You never gonna see what you like
You never gonna wake up and change your mind
