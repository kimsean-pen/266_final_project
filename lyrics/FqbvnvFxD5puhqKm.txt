Wake me in the morning,
I don't want to sleep very long,
I'll unpack my suitcase,
Only if you you pick up the phone.

Only if we could say we're sorry,
Only if we could say we're not,
Only if you could say you loved me,
Only if... I was the one.

Wake me in the evening,
I don't wan't to get out of bed,
I'll pick up my laundry,
Only if you open the door.

Only if we could say we're sorry,
Only if we could say we're not,
Only if you could say you loved me,
Only if... I was the one.

I don't want to waste my time,
I just want to dance all night,
I don't want to wait for you,
All of my life.

I don't want to close my eyes,
I just want to dance all night,
I don't want to wait for you,
All of my life.

Wake me in the weekend,
I don't care if sleep too long,
I'll take out the garbage,
Only if you pick up that phone.

Only if we could say we're sorry,
Only if we could say we're not,
Only if you could say you loved me,
Only if... I was the one.

I don't want to waste my time,
I just want to dance all night,
I don't want to wait for you,
All of my life.
I don't want to close my eyes,
I just want to dance all night,
I don't want to wait for you,
All of my life.

I told you,
I'm never gonna leave again,
And I swear,
You told me your never gonna cheat again,
I don't care.
Tell my heart a million times,
and that won't change me none
If we need some time to think girl,
You're not the one.

I don't want to waste my time,
I just want to dance all night,
I don't want to wait for you,
All of my life.
I don't want to close my eyes,
I just want to dance all night,
I don't want to wait for you,
All of my life.

I don't want to waste my time,
I just want to dance all night,
I don't want to wait for you,
All of my life.
I don't want to close my eyes,
I just want to dance all night,
I don't want to wait for you,
All of my... life.
