What will you do
When it's right up on you
Like a ring of fire?
Why ask why?
No need to justify
Who really cares anyway?

Ethical tragedy
Rabid humanity
Learn from the past so they say

Now is the time
To make up your mind
And find out what is real
Fight or flight
You can't run
You can't run from yourself

One reason to survive
With a thousand ways to die
When you're living on the wire
Reaching the threshold
Near system overload
Caught on the red-eye again

Now is the time
To make up your mind
And find out what is real
Fight or flight
You can't run
You can't run from yourself

Close your eyes
And hear the voices in your head
Grand disguise
This mass confusion
Revered illusion

Some grip the mast
On their final descent
Into the darkness below
Others will fight
Kick and crawl their way out
There is no heaven below

Now is the time
To make up your mind
And find out what is real
Fight or flight
You can't run
You can't run from yourself

Fight!
You can't run
Fight!
From the arrow of time
