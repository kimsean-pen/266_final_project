And now I wonder where you roam
I've been here a thousand times before
I see it
I see it
I see it
go

You follow me a shadow
move me just enough
to pass the time
I see it
I see you
I see you
follow

So easy
so easy

And now I wonder where you roam
I've been here a thousand times before
go go go

You pause
I turn
you pull
I part
I can't afford to stop now

You bend
I fall
you walk
I stop
in waves of noise
you send me

Come
come
come
come

You pause
I turn

You follow me a shadow
move me just enough
to pass the time
I see it
I see you
I see you
follow

So easy
so easy

And now I wonder where you roam
I've been here a thous
and times before
go
go
go

You pause
I turn
you pull
I part
I can't afford to stop now

You bend
I fall
you walk
I stop
in waves of noise
you send me

Come
come
come
come
