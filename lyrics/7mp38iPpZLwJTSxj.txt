Every time you come too close
Every time you come
Every time I loose my way
Every time I loose
Someone take my hand
Because I can feel myself
Dying inside

Every time you come too close
Every time you come
Every time I loose my way
Every time I loose
Someone take my hand
Because I can feel myself
Dying inside
Dying inside
Dying inside
Dying inside
Dying inside

Every time you come too close
Every time you come
Every time I loose my way
Every time I loose
Someone take my hand
Because I can feel myself
Dying inside
