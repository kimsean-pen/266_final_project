I'm waiting, the summer, the light that shines right from your eyes
Cuz i can be much better than you knew, from a long long time ago.
I like you, i feel you.
I'm struggling with the feeling that you be around,
And i hope that this time is for real.
Do you want to live just trying to remember,
That sundays she might be around...
And you've got to know that i don't really need you.
She is so hot to satisfy...
And i know, and you know, and she knows,
That my love won't fade away
Do you want to live just trying to remember,
That sundays she might be around.
