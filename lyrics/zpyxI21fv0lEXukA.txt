Out from the sleeping bag
Another day to be had
And it almost feels like new
But I was dreaming of you

And now we're back on the road
Another season of shows
Until every thought is gone
And we're just rolling along

And I forgot how to feel
Every sight is surreal
If there's one thing that I know
It's that all good times go
And the hard times too

And the life that we had
Is the dream of my youth
It was too good to be true
And the highway stretches on
I just want to get gone
