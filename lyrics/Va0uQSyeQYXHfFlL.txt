I only ever wanna be a part of you
You know I only wanted you
You say you really need to think about it
If only this was half true
The situation still changes in time
But will you ever be mine?
I'm only waiting for the chance to rise
Yeah, whenever it's fine

I thought you said you can't stand to see me
I never think about you anyway
Why don't you want to ever believe me?
I never cared about you anyway

I know everything will end
I don't care 'cause I can't pretend
I'm not in love with you

I need her breathing on the phone
Listening to me
I wanna be alone
Just with me and you

Give me the chance to tell you how it really feels
The implications are real
She said "I know it's you who's crossing every line"
"And that's a truth you can't conceal"
When I'm alone with you for fractions at a time
Only then she's truly mine
She said "I'm always in the corner of your mind"
"Your concillation is fine"

I thought you said you can't stand to see me
I never think about you anyway
Why don't you want to ever believe me?
I never cared about you anyway

I know everything will end
I don't care 'cause I can't pretend
I'm not in love with you

I need her breathing on the phone
Listening to me
I wanna be alone
Just with me and you

I thought you said you can't stand to see me
Why don't you want to ever believe me?

I know everything will end
I don't care 'cause I can't pretend
I'm not in love with you

I need her breathing on the phone
Listening to me
I wanna be alone
Just with me and you
