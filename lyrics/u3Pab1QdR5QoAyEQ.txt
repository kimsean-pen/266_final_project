The sources of life are bleeding
The wretch you call God has failed
Feel the presence of evil
The winds of salvation unleashed

Bringer of terror

Behold the starry wings of Satan
The chains that held him are smashed
Never again shall the throne
Of this globe remain empty

No mercy can be brought to you now
For who could forget that you worshipped the light
Who could forget the stench of your lies
So now you shall bleed for your lord Jesus Christ

Back to chaos!
No escape!

The sources of light are fading
The bringer of dawn on his knees
King of terror
Evil one let there be darkness

Bringer of terror

Crepuscular storms are tearing
The heart of your faith apart
Never again are you to
Rest from this torture of ours

Look at them...
Weakness in human form.
Unite their flesh with steel!
For what are their lives compared to our pleasure?
