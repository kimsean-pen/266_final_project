There is a room
It floats above the stars
This is my home
It's filled with twisted light
Our prayers will speak soon
But not without words
Where I had lost you
But now I've found you
With only one word I reach you
Glowing sun
And here you are, and here you are
Now I have found you
It's time to say goodnight
How could I reach you
When you had passed me by
I said the last word
Only this one word
It couldn't save you from the long night
With all the brave hearts in opal sky
Glowing sunday
And in your shadows the frightened eyes
And here you are Glosoli
And here you are Glosoli
And here you are Glosoli
And here you are Glosoli
And here you are
