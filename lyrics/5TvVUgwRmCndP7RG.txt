I'm a terrible person
I'm a terrible person

I'm a terrible person
'Cause I've made up my mind
I'm a terrible person
'Cause I've led her on

And I'm the only one who knows
What I've done to her, oh yeah
I'm much smarter now
I won't tell her friends before her
Oh, I'm afraid

It's gonna be a bad day come Sunday
It's gonna be a bad day come Sunday
It's gonna be a bad day come Sunday
It's gonna be a bad day come Sunday

I'm a horrible person
I read her diary
I'm not to be trusted
I told all of her secrets

To all the guys in town
They all laugh and slap me five, oh yeah
Luckily she doesn't have dirt on me
'Cause I'm the cleanest guy
Oh, I'm so afraid

It's gonna be a bad day come Sunday
It's gonna be a bad day come Sunday
It's gonna be a bad day come Sunday
It's gonna be a bad day come Sunday

Well, I don't think I'll ever be sorry
No, I'm not sorry for a thing I've done
And I don't think I'll ever wake up lonely
'Cause having her around wasn't all that special

I don't think I'll ever be sorry
No, I'm not sorry for a thing I've done
And I don't think I'll ever wake up lonely
'Cause having her around wasn't all that special

It's gonna be a bad day come Sunday
It's gonna be a bad day come Sunday
It's gonna be a bad day come Sunday
It's gonna be a bad day come Sunday
