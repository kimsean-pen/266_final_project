She slams the door then hitched a ride
Her sights set on intent to die
There's no forgiveness in living
He picks her up and ties the rop so tight
Her cuffs are swelling black and blue
Pinching and bleeding

She lifts the mask and screams
"Where have you been?
I wanna die, I wanna die
I AM THE WILLING"
He says, "You're wrong don't lie to me
I've picked you up to set you free
It's just your body I'm stealing."

We fall, we fall in love
With strangers killing time
We fall, we fall in love
With strangers in the night

So now's the hour
Say your prayers and goodbyes
To a God who doesn't care
And doesn't mind

We fall, we fall in love
With strangers killing time
We fall, we fall in love
With strangers in the night

We fall, we fall in love
With strangers killing time
We fall, we fall in love
With strangers in the night
We fall, we fall in love
With strangers killing time
We fall, we fall in love
With strangers in the night
We fall, we fall in love
With strangers killing time
We fall, we fall in love
With strangers in the night
