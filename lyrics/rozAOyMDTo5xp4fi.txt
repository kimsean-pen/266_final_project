Leave memories behind
When passion is our crime
Go from hiding to shining tonight

Our crime
Memories that we have left behind
In time
Divide
Casualties of war within our minds
Defined

Is this what we wanted?
Because this is what we get
Our memories are haunted
There's no way to forget

Jumping time
Leave memories behind
Whoa-oh!
Jumping time
When passion is our crime
Go from hiding to shining tonight

Collide
Tragedies buried beneath the sands
Of time
Denied
The safety of a world and the future
Bloodline

Are our memories all haunted?
When we just can't forget
And is this what we wanted?
'Cause this is what we get

Jumping time
Leave memories behind
Whoa-oh!
Jumping time
When passion is our crime
Go from hiding to shining tonight

Jumping time
Leave memories behind
Whoa-oh!
Jumping time
When passion is our crime
Go from hiding to shining tonight

Jumping time
Go from hiding to shining tonight
Whoa-oh!
Go from hiding to shining tonight
