That's the start the middle and the end
Aren't you glad the universe pretend
If I don't get this message home
Once again, I'm gonna hate alone

Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me

Bored aloud ignored the right to be
Invite me down because we like to see
The colors through your loaded mind
Fuck the world and liberate our time

Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me

I'm not waiting a long while
I'm not waiting alone

Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me
