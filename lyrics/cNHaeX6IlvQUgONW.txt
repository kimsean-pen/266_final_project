Open the amps up - let them breathe
You and me in this scene
Open the big camera box now
Bleed the lens (and oh how)
It reminds me of a kid - always lit, always did
Exactly what I said

Even if I didn't know
Even if I didn't go
Straight Straight Straight

Open the doors - let the light in
Let it blend/winter mind
And if the winter wind chills me
Then we will know to bend it backwards
You say you know my friend
That one kid I mistook for my future
would you know
Where to go, and where to find him?

Stay
