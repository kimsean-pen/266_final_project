No
Turn off the sun
Take down the moon
For I don't need them anymore
Go
Switch off the stars
And paint the sky black
Love isn't ever coming back
There's no use in imagining a world without you
Your love was like a drug I was addicted to
'Cause there's nobody else who could hurt like you hurt me
I don't want to be lonely
And there's no other way
There's no joy, there's no meaning
Just this hollowed out feeling
Now all the love's gone
And nothing grows here
And I just feel wrong
So black out the sun
And all that we shared will slowly disappear
There's a hole where my soul used to grow
So just black out the sun
No
Stop all the rain
And poison the ground
Love doesn't want to hang around
Go
Turn all the fruit into bitter wine
It was only sweet when you were mine
There's an emptiness inside of me
Since you've been gone
All the world has lost it's meaning, all my colors run
'Cause there's nobody else who could hurt like you hurt me
I don't want to be lonely
And there's no other way
There's no joy, there's no meaning
Just this hollowed out feeling
Now all the love's gone
And nothing grows here
And I just feel wrong
So black out the sun
And all that we shared will slowly disappear
There's a hole where my soul used to grow
So just black out the sun
And nothing compares
How could it even dare?
'Cause now that love's gone
I want to black out the sun
'Cause there's nobody else who could hurt like you hurt me
I don't want to be lonely
And there's no other way
There's no joy, there's no meaning
Just this hollowed out feeling
Now all the love's gone
And nothing grows here
And I just feel wrong
So black out the sun
And all that we shared will slowly disappear
There's a hole where my soul used to grow
So just black out the sun
