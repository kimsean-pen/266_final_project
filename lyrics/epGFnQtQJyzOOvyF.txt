By Palm Desert
to market to buy.
Tenderfoot up to date
palms of the real estate.

By Palm Desert
springs often run dry.
I came west unto Hollywood,
never-never land.

Juxtaposed to B.B.D. and O.
Beyond San Fernando
on hillside manors
on the banks of toxicity
those below and those above the same.

Dreams are still born
in Hollywood I don't understand.
Just suppose the youngster knows
he's had a good deal of fortune
and up through the babble
on the fair banks complicity,
buy your leave or stay beyond the game.

Palm Desert
not fade away.
Palm Desert
I wish I could stay.
Palm Desert
sages abound.

So head your head
to the ground round.

Meanwhile in the wild west
of Hollywood age is losing hold.
Inasmuch as you are touched
to have withstood
by the very old search
for the truth within
the bounds of toxicity.
Left unsung
so I have strung the frame.
