They came riding down the slopes
Five fearless men prepared to fight
We heard with fear the rumbling earth
In the mid-day light

Surprised we saw all terrified
The brave northmen's run
The fearless five with power ride
Attacking us in the mid-day sun

Their charge was fast, no alarm was sound
They broke right through our lines
I felt the cut it threw me to the ground
And now I feel has come my time

I lie here in my blood
And see my family get killed
I feel abandoned by my god
I fear death's chill

I see Hel's gates
Towering high
And dark are they
I don't want to die

Oh no! I was wrong
Denied the true Gods
And now I'm doomed
I trusted foreign men
And their god's son
But now when I need them
They are gone

I see Hel's gates
Towering high
And dark are they
I die!

They ride across the planes
And punish those of false belief
All resistance is in vain
As they caress them with cold steel

They are the punishers
And they will never bend
They are power the five of them
From Asgard they are sent

The power they have in all they do
The Christians non will feel
No one can escape them no
Them will make them kneel

Their fight is through, they must return
No one here survived
And as the blood red sky begins to burn
To Valhall they will ride
