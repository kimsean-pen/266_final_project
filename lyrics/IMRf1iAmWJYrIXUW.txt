Let's just stop
drop everything
(forget each other's names) forget each other's names
And just walk away.

...
Turn around and head in different directions
Like we never, it's like we never knew each other at all.
We said what we feel, then we stop ourselves
And just walk away.
Never looking back
Loving every second of it

we just walk away.
This is probably the best
not to mention the worst idea

that I have ever had.
Ignoring what we've felt
Overlooking what we've done
No awkward silences, no hiding any truths
Ignoring what we've felt
Overlooking what we've done

What do you say?

Let's just stop
Drop everything
Forget each other's names
Can we please just walk away?
It could be... It could be...

Like we never knew each other at all.

Answer me!

All egos aside, what do you say?
