I candy coat and cover everything
But I'm still hiding underneath
It's been a long time, it's been a long time
A thousand faces looking up at me
Hands all pointing to the ceiling
Oh what a feeling

I've got friends in highly low places
I'm standing on post, and I'm posted up
Can't afford to lose them
I've got friends in highly low places
I'll go inside when I wanna party
Grab a girl and dance (don't touch me)

Whoa oh, whoa, whoa oh
Why do I put myself in these situations
Whoa oh, whoa, whoa oh
I keep pushing myself, even though I can't take it at all

Girl, who taught you how to move like that?
At this pace you're at you're going way too fast
I, I saw you from across the room, it's me versus every guy
It's your choice, you choose

I've got friends in highly low places
It's been a long time, it's been a long time
And maybe baby, you can rise above the rest and meet me, yeah

Whoa oh, whoa, whoa oh
Why do I put myself in these situations
Whoa oh, whoa, whoa oh
I keep pushing myself, even though I can't take it at all

Whoa oh, whoa, whoa oh
Why do I put myself in these situations
Whoa oh, whoa, whoa oh
I keep pushing myself, even though I can't take it at all

You're worth losing my self esteem
Your clever words mean nothing

More to me than a line I heard in a movie
You're worth losing my, losing my, losing my self esteem

You're not worth putting myself in these situations

Whoa oh, whoa, whoa oh
Why do I put myself in these situations
Whoa oh, whoa, whoa oh
I keep pushing myself, even though I can't take it at all
Whoa oh, whoa, whoa oh
Why do I put myself in these situations
Whoa oh, whoa, whoa oh
I keep pushing myself, even though I can't take it at all
