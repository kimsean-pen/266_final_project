There is an endless song, echoes in my soul
I hear the music ring
And though the storms may come, I am holding on
To the rock I cling

How can I keep from singing Your praise
How can I ever say enough, how amazing is Your love
How can I keep from shouting Your name
I know I am loved by the King and it makes my heart want to sing

I will lift my eyes in the darkest night
For I know my Savior lives
And I will walk with You knowing You'll see me through
And sing the songs You give

How can I keep from singing Your praise
How can I ever say enough, how amazing is Your love
How can I keep from shouting Your name
I know I am loved by the King and it makes my heart want to sing

I can sing in the troubled times, sing when I win
I can sing when I lose my step and I fall down again
I can sing 'cause You pick me up, sing 'cause You're there
I can sing 'cause You hear me, Lord, when I call to You in prayer

I can sing with my last breath, sing for I know
That I'll sing with the Angels and the Saints around the throne

How can I keep from singing Your praise
How can I ever say enough, how amazing is Your love
How can I keep from shouting Your name
I know I am loved by the King and it makes my heart
I am loved by the King and it makes my heart
I am loved by the King and it makes my heart want to sing, yeah
I can sing
