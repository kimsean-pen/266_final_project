I had shoes full of holes
When you first took me in
The path that you led
Was straight to your bed
There's no cots to sleep in
And you showed me
Who I was running from
As if I had not known all along
Oh my old feet
They know this hard street
Stay like old friends
You're flat on the ground
There's no further down
There's no cots to sleep in
So come in
Leave them outside the door
Tear off the paper
Tear off the carpet
Off the floor

And I know you're hurting
And I can't be there for you
And I know you're hurting
And I can't be there no more
I had shoes full of holes
When you first took me in
I had callouses, not sores
And I'd like to keep them
So go turn those sheets
Get back on the street
There's nothing more I can bring to you
They are scared of the door
Afraid of the floor
Well, I'll go and walk right through
And I'll show you
Who I've been running from

It's the feeling of waking
And it's gone

And I know you're hurting
And I can't be there for you
And I know you're hurting
And I can't be there no more

I had shoes full of holes
When you first took me in
I had callouses, not sores
And I'd like to keep them
Oh now your feet
They know this hard street
They're like old friends
You're flat on the ground
There's no further down
There's no cots to sleep in
So come in
Leave them outside the door
Tear off the paper
Tear off the carpet
Off the floor

And I know you're hurting
And I can't be there for you
And I know you're hurting
And I can't be there no more

I had shoes full of holes
When you first took me in
I had callouses, not sores
And I'd like to keep them
So go turn those sheets
Get back on the street
There's nothing more I can bring to you
They are scared of the door
Afraid of the floor
Well, I'll go and walk right through

And I'll show you
Who I've been running from
It's the feeling of waking
And it's gone
