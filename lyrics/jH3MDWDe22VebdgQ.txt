The strobe light feels like smiling
The eye that has a large pupil
My brain's being searched... Not
"Magical illusion"

Towards me, up from above
Like inviting me
They take turns, one by one
The light show in the small hours

Mysterious night, ah... Like I'm dreaming, ah...
Mysterious night, ah... Like I'm dreaming, ah...

The UFO signals to me, like "Come on!"
Awesome, isn't it?
Can't stop the leaking rhythm and pulse
Exciting, isn't it?

Whole lotta dreams, ah...
We're almost riding on the stardust, ah...
As we look on, ah...
Mysterious night

Mysterious night, ah... Like I'm dreaming, ah...
Very mysterious light, ah... Like I'm dreaming, ah...

As if I'm starting dancing Like I'm dreaming, ah...
Very mysterious light, ah...
Mysterious night
