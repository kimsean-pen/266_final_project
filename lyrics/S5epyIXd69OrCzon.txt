Watching your empire fall!

You'll never stop till you get what you want!
You think you have control?
You tried to take mine!
But I won't leave till I get what I want!
Over and over, bending and breaking!
Watching your empire fall!
Watching the ashes fall!

Will it ever cross your mind?
I'm the man you'll never be
Think about me when you're all alone
Without someone to love
Without someone to love

Am I gonna be the last one standing?
How's it gonna feel when I'm on top
I guess I'll watch you walk away

Don't waste my time!
You've got this upside down!
What were you thinking of?
What were you thinking of?
You've got this upside down!
What were you thinking of?
What were you thinking of?
Watching your empire fall!
Watching the ashes fall!

Will it ever cross your mind?
I'm the man you'll never be
Think about me when you're all alone
Without someone to love
You're out there on your own

Am I gonna be the last one standing?
How's it gonna feel when I'm on top?
I guess I'll watch you walk away
And let your empire crumble

Am I gonna be the last one standing?
How's it gonna feel when I'm on top?
I guess I'll watch you walk away
And let your empire crumble

You decide what's next for us!
Over and over, you sold me out!
You decide what's next for us!
Over and over, bending and breaking!

You decide what's next for us!
You decide what's next for us!
You'll never learn!
You never will!
You'll never learn!
You never will!

You decide what's next for us!
You decide what's next for us!
