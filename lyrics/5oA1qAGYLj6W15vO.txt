The police are gonna wound me
The minister will heal me
But I think he'll do it equally violently
Should I ask him to?
Should I ask him to?
Should I ask him to?
Should ask him to?
Only one
Only one
Could lay claim to me
Only one
Only one
Would choicelessly be sung
Please say no
Please say no
Please say no
Please say no

I cannot spare thought
I cannot spare thought
Spare thought, spare thought
Spare thought

Lay down
Was I born a roach?
The belly crawling ground
Just as I supposed
I hear holy hum of
Dust thy essence off!
You are gladly so
You are biting now
Softest teeth I know
It's in the artist's soul
It's in there I should know
In all my decent days
It was in every one

A love that is awaiting
A love that is awaiting
On my shook soul
In the never never never
Him I know do you know
Been a little leaden lately
Come back down on my soul
Least he eats the breadcrumbs
That I've thrown
Lay loose
It's all I'd ever do
Forever
Forever

God loves the aching one
He loves the aching one
Please send the cut thing home
Am I the aching one?

It's a limb that I'd like to offer
It's a limb that I'd like to offer
I don't care about the fools or father
It's a limb that I'd like loose.
