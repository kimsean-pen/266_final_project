Reallocating property
We engender transformation
We're not concerned with poverty
Just the rebirth of a nation
No time for hesitation
Not even on occasion

This will be our legacy
A vengeful population
It's part of our conspiracy
And our motivation

And who needs integration
When we've got isolation?
It's the rebirth of a nation
The rebirth of a nation

We don't mind democracy
We have our ways around it
This new improved hypocrisy
Will help us to impound it
An old school education
Will show this generation
