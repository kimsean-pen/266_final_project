I'll tear it down, I don't care what it is
It's all the same to me 'cause I'm fukin' destructive
I consume rubble like it's water and air
I'll tear it down to the ground like it was never there
And I love the smell of dust from a tumbling place
The rumble, from the grumble, underneath my feet
And the power over something, power to destroy
I've got a smile on my face, 'cause I am overjoyed

Demolition man
Tearing down walls and excavating
Demolition man
I'm a wrecking ball, stay out of my way
Demolition man
Near the caution line I spend my time
Demolition man
Push the button down and bring it to the ground

When I look up, I se the falling walls
The sky coming down and crushing it all
And not even the devil can survive the pain
When my soul crushing demolition ends the game
I will take history right down to the earth
And leave a scar for the future to begin rebirth
Concrete, steel, brick, beams and stone
It all came down like a card house blown

Demolition man
Tearing down walls and excavating
Demolition man
I'm a wrecking ball, stay out of my way
Demolition man
Near the caution line I spend my time
Demolition man
Push the button down and bring it to the ground
