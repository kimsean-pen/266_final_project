How does it feel?
To welcome the new day
Not worth saving

To fall down on own imprudent acts
The wind answers quietly
Clears the black smoke far thick to see
unfolds the true nature of man

And this fire it burns,
consuming us all
Withered garden for posterity
Inheritance in flames

When the mankind moves
rest of the life shakes
All once green turned into stone,
flesh into dust and soil

Where the last wave broke
the shores blazed red
And place once called home
turned into hall of dead

How does it feel?

Bite the hand that feeds you
Poison the well that waters you
Prospects made from castles of sand
Legacy in barren land

Breed
Greed
Bleed
Legacy in barren land

The last wave broke
Prospects made from castles of sand

When the mankind moves
rest of the life shakes
All once green turned into stone,
flesh into dust and soil

Where the last wave broke
the shores blazed red
And place once called home
turned into hall of dead
