Amen

This little light of mine
I'm going to let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm going to let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm going to let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine
To show my love

Everywhere I go, I'm gonna let it shine
Everywhere I go, I'm gonna let it shine
Everywhere I go, I'm gonna let it shine
I let it shine to show my love

Even in my home, I'm gonna let it shine
I let it shine to show my love

When I see my neighbor coming
I'm gonna let it shine

Amen
