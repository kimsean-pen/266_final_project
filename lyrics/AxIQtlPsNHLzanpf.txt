I don't love you baby
Don't love you at all
I don't want you baby
Don't want you at all

I fear it's worse than that
I fear it's worse than that

Chorus:
I need you
Need you baby
This craving makes me crazy
I'm dying inside
Baby make up your mind
I need you
Need you baby
I'm holding on, but barely
I'm dying inside
And I cannot hide my need

I don't miss you baby
Don't miss you tonight
I don't want to hold you
Don't want to touch you just right

I fear it's worse than that
I fear it's worse than that

CHORUS
I need you
Need you baby
This craving makes me crazy
I'm dying inside
Baby make up your mind
I need you
Need you baby
I'm holding on, but barely
I'm dying inside
And I cannot hide my need

How could you just walk away
Nonchalant and unafraid
When it feels to me like you just took my soul

Chorus X2

Oh need X2
