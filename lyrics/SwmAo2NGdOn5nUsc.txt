I play the clown for you
Entertaining, absurd hue
As I watch them laugh, I'd love to
See them clap and dance to my tune
Blowing up like a red giant, expansive a star
And I'm coming to burn this down and laugh my ass off
All my children sing it again and again
'Cause a lie ain't a lie if you're winning 'em over
Amen
I act on stage up here
Toying with your own fears
Misdirection I'm so near
Simple sleight of hand, in the clear
Blowing up like a red giant, expansive a star
And I'm coming to burn this down and laugh my ass off
All my children sing it again and again
'Cause a lie ain't a lie if you're winning 'em over
Amen
To late now, show's over
Real life is much close
Take the make up off, you wonder
Why I look the same - only bolder
Blowing up like a red giant, expansive a star
And I'm coming to burn this down and laugh my ass off
All my children sing it again and again
'Cause a lie ain't a lie if you're winning 'em over
Amen
All my children sing it again and again
'Cause a lie ain't a lie if you're winning 'em over
