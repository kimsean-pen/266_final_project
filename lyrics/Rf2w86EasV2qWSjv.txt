I don't worry anymore
Nothing like I did before
I don't worry
I just watch them rolling back
I don't worry anymore
'Cause it's all right, all right to see a ghost
And I wanna see 'em go down in the river where they go
And I wanna see 'em rolling, rolling back
And I wanna see 'em go
'Cause it's all right, all right to see your ghost

I'm gonna run to the river
Kiss my hand and wait
Gonna run to the river
Gonna throw a blue bouquet
'Cause they're gonna be cool happy genius heroes
I'm gonna miss 'em so much

I will settle in and dream
Of a slow and funny scene
I will settle in and watch 'em rolling back
I will settle in and dream
'Cause it's all right, all right to see a ghost
And I wanna see 'em go down in the river where they go
And I wanna see 'em rolling, rolling back

I'm gonna run to the river
Kiss my hand and wait
Gonna run to the river
Gonna throw a blue bouquet
'Cause they're gonna be cool happy genius heroes
I'm gonna miss them so much

I'm gonna run to the river
Kiss my hand and wait
Gonna run to the river
Gonna send 'em on their way
'Cause they're gonna be cool happy genius heroes
I'm gonna miss them so much

Yeah, they're gonna be cool happy genius heroes
I'm gonna miss 'em so much
