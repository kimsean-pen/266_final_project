She's hearing voices, call her
She's hearing voices, warn her
She just can't sleep in her bed
She just can't sleep
She's falling down the stairs
She's tearing out her hair
She's screaming my name, in the night to keep her warm.
She got a red pill blue pill
Red pill blue pill
Red pill blue pill
Red pill blue pill
Milk of amnesia.
Hey, hey, hey
Come on in, I know that you want it,
Was it nothing to write home about?
Did the earth, did the earth not move?
She got a red pill blue pill...
She's scared of the blacks and she's scared of the Jews
She is walking around, she is yesterday's news
And she calls out my name in the dead of the night
She is leaving my room, she is crying on her side
Walking on eggshells, walking on glass
Burnt by the mirror, burnt by the light
Feeling rejection, I'll burn down your house
Tearing down posters, I was never alive.
