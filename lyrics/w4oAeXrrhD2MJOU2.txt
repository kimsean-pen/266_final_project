Look over on your left, look over on the right
There's nothing you can see out there, but this ain't no fair fight
A lot of people dying, men driven raving mad
They scream out there for hours, and it makes you feel real bad

Heroes, heroes
Nobody wants to be here, nobody wants to fall
Fools, fools
But no one walks away from here, backs to the wall

Stand your ground and fight
You know that our cause is right
We are the ones, whose hope has gone
Hold and stand fast

Stand and do your best
Stand and face your test
Until you fall, you must obey the call
For we are the last

Do you understand how you've become a fighting man
You must be hard as nails and kill with sword and hand
You march on our command, you fight until the death
You fight till life runs out of you and you draw your final breath

Heroes, heroes
We must hold them on the line, they must not advance
Fools, fools
So if you would be legends, boys, this is your chance

Stand your ground and fight
You know that our cause is right
We are the ones, whose hope has gone
Hold and stand fast

Stand and do your best
Stand and face your test
Until you fall, you must obey the call
For we are the last

One day men will look back here to see the bloody day
When we stood at the edge and fought and no one ran away
The story will get bigger as it's handed down the years
And so pass into legend to tell what happened here

Heroes, heroes
You know we can't win here, but we must not run
Fools, fools
Now get yourselves ready, for the last attack comes

Stand your ground and fight (Stand before the world)
You know that our cause is right (We are standing here)
We are the ones, whose hope has gone (We will stand forever)
Hold and stand fast

Stand and do your best (We will not back down)
Stand and face your test (Even should we die)
Until you fall, you must obey the call
For we are the last
