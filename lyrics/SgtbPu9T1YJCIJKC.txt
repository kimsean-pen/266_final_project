You know what I think?
You should just fly

If you have any fears
Let'em go, let'em go
I woke up wasting your kiss
You can go, there's the door

And I know that I wasn't in the picture
Tried to paint it, looking perfect
And it never worked for the both of us
I'ma let you know, now I'll let you go

You should fly
For the first time in a long time
Just fly
Let you go, let you go
Let you fly
For the first time in a long time
Just fly
Let you go, let you go
Oh!

When I was at your house
I was sad, I was down
Tried to fix what we had
Didn't work, wasn't sure

And I know that I wasn't in the picture
Tried to paint it, looking perfect
And it never worked for the both of us
I'ma let you know, now I'll let you go

You should fly
For the first time in a long time
Just fly
Let you go, let you go
Let you fly
For the first time in a long time
Just fly
Let you go, let you go
Oh!

Oh! Oh! Oh!

You should fly
For the first time in your own line
Just fly
Let your real ambitions go
And fly
You should fly
For the first time in a long time
Just fly
Fly, fly, fly
