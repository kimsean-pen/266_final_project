Every new day that you start
Plans the minute you're flagging your heart, heart
Where you waking up today
My little runaway?

Every red eye that you cross
Makes the next feel serious
Where you waking up today
My little runaway?

My little runaway
My little runaway
My little runaway

Every silver shell that you crush
Will be enough
Where you gonna sleep today
My little runaway?

When you feel like everyone
Wants to kill the unicorn
Where you waking up today
My little runaway?

My little runaway
My little runaway
My little runaway
