Learning to trust
More than expression
Believe in me now
Believe in intention

Lend me your faith
Don't ask any questions
Morals aside
You could have it all
You could have it

...
It's a matter of choice
...

Learning to trust
My hand to you
My hand to you
Just as simple
Just as simple as that
You're only human
An observer at that
And if you're wary
Don't believe me at that

When I say that
I wouldn't
I wouldn't dare

...
On the tip of your tongue
Mercy awaits
And cuts like a knife
Bound to the badlands

Heaven's distraction
There's no persuasion
Stronger than sorrow

It's stronger than
...
It's a matter of choice
...
Learning to trust
My hand to you
My hand to you
Just as simple
Just as simple as that
You're only human
An observer at that
And if you're wary
Don't believe me at that
When I say that
I wouldn't
I wouldn't dare
I wouldn't dare
I wouldn't dare
