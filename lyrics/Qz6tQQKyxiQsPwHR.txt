Then you said
Meet me at the food court at 10am
Or there abouts you weren't quite sure
Savages are closing in
I grit my teeth

And I'll be waiting
Watching the fights
Caused by all the
MDMA leeching away
And I'll be waiting
Fluorescent lights
Thinking about all of the things that we've done right

In the place
The city and the suburbs meet
It won't be long
'Til there's some shit going down
I belong
Everywhere that you are found

And I'll be waiting
Watching the fights
Caused by all the
MDMA leeching away
And I'll be waiting
Fluorescent lights
Thinking about all of the things that we've done right

And I'll be waiting
Watching the fights
Caused by all the
MDMA leeching away
And I'll be waiting
Fluorescent lights
Thinking about all of the things that we've done right
