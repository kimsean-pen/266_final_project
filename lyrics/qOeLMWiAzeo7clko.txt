I'm feeling hollowed out, left to the bone
I'm scared of dying here all on my own
I'm a slave for you under factory heat
Working my life away for something to eat

I've never known a world outside these walls
I've heard the stories, stories that call
And they keep me up, thoughts of living free
I'll stand up there on my own two feet

Won't knock me
Won't knock me
Won't knock me
Won't knock me down, won't knock me down
(Won't knock me)
Won't knock me down, won't knock me down
(Won't knock me)
Won't knock me down, won't knock me down
(Won't knock me)
Won't knock me down, won't knock me down

Born in the shadows of a violent machine
Washing my brain of all that I believe
Was a slave for you, now I'm breaking out free
I'll pull the curtain down, now I can see

I duck my head into the cover of night
I'm sick of watching, watching 'em die
Run for the fences yeah I'm breaking free
I'll stand up there on my own two feet

Won't knock me
Won't knock me
Won't knock me
Won't knock me down, won't knock me down
(Won't knock me)
Won't knock me down, won't knock me down
(Won't knock me)
Won't knock me down, won't knock me down
(Won't knock me)
Won't knock me down, won't knock me down
(Won't knock me)

Won't knock me down, won't knock me down
(Won't knock me)
Won't knock me down, won't knock me down
(Won't knock me)
Won't knock me down, won't knock me down
(Won't knock me)
Won't knock me down, won't knock me down
(Won't knock me)

etc.
