I search valleys and mountaintops
Rolling hills and ticking clocks
Were all I heard all that sound
Never thought love could be found
(love x4)

I kept passing by every sign
Hoping one day I'd make you mine
We'd be laughing side by side
Darling I'm thrilled to have you
By my side

Wherever you are
Whenever you need me
Just crawl in my arms
Oh and I'll hold you beside me

I want my love to surround you
I want my love to surround you
And I'll just sing it out
I want my love to surround you

I search valleys and mountaintops
Rolling hills and ticking clocks
Where all I heard all that sound
Never thought love could be found
