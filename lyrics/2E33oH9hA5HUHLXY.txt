I see the airport more than i see my family
I'm on the move, how can you be mad at me?
Sky high I'll get there gradually
Sky high I'll get there gradually
I'll come alive in the night time
I'll die again up in the day light
I'll come alive in the night time
I'll die again up in the day light

[?] kid cudi, mm, so official
Passion pain demon slang, lost up in the mirror
Its like looking up at a painting too close with blurry vision
Get back, step back look at the bigger picture
Full of advice I don't use
I'm a contradiction but isn't that how we learn?
Imma do it wrong till I get it
Regrets don't exist I'm limitless
NZT up in my system
Don't bother me (Yeah)
They pretending they in love with me (Where?)
I just wanna get lost in peace
Alone in my soul, living comfortably
No touching me, come fuck with me

I see the airport more than i see my family
I'm on the move, how can you be mad at me?
Sky high I'll get there gradually
Sky high I'll get there gradually
I'll come alive in the night time
I'll die again up in the day light
I'll come alive in the night time
I'll die again up in the day light

Pushin the poison up out my veins today
I'm drinking up out of the bottle I'm trying to change my ways
She got sharp tongue like it's made of razorblades
She got a mouth full of blood when she say my name
You say i need to go i say mind your business too
Too busy thinking bout dying up in the living room
Takeshi's Castle, open the door fall out
Glow boy, like ball out
I'm bout to tone out

I see the airport more than i see my family
I'm on the move, how can you be mad at me?
Sky high I'll get there gradually
Sky high I'll get there gradually
I'll come alive in the night time
I'll die again up in the day light
I'll come alive in the night time
I'll die again up in the day light
I see the airport more than i see my family
I'm on the move how can you be mad at me?
Sky high I'll get there gradually
Sky high I'll get there gradually
I'll come alive in the night time
I'll die again up in the day light
I'll come alive in the night time
I'll die again up in the day light
