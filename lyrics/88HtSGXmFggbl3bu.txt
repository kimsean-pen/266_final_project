It only takes three words
To say all I want
And so many more
To undo what I've done with us
I, I
Wait for the sun (the sun)
To rise (to rise)
My mind is lost in all sorts of places
Last night's, just a pair of faces
The one thing I remember is the look in your eye
I don't have the answer for you, don't ask me why

Oooh
Waiting for the sun to
Waiting for the sun to rise
Ooh
Waiting for the sun to
Waiting for the sun to rise
Ahh, Ahh, Aah
Waiting for the sun to
Waiting for the sun to rise
Keep you in the dark
You will see the truth to this light

You're not usually this out of control, yeah
You gave me the wheel and you said "can you take me home"
(I do it every time, I hold my heart back, I don't know why)
Life is full of awkward conversations
Like when you asked me, "What game are you playing"
I can never tell you while I'm looking in your eyes
Please don't make me say it can we just make this sound right?

Oooh
Waiting for the sun to
Waiting for the sun to rise
Ohh
Waiting for the sun to
Waiting for the sun to rise
Ahh, Ahh, Aah, Ooh
Waiting for the sun to
Waiting for the sun to rise
Keep you in the dark
You will see the truth to this light
I'll promise myself
This would be the last time
That I
Keep you in the dark
You will see the truth to this light
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

Ahh, ahh, aah
Waiting for the sun to
Waiting for the sun to rise
Ahh, ahh, aah
Waiting for the sun to
Waiting for the sun to rise
Ahh, Ahh, Aah
Waiting for the sun to
Waiting for the sun to rise
Ahh, Ahh, Aah
Waiting for the sun to
Waiting for the sun to rise

Waiting for the sun to
Waiting for the sun to rise
Ahh, Ahh, Aah
