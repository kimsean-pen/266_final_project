I'm a sinner
I will consider
I am my father's son
I'm a sinner
I must consider
I've never owned a gun

I'm a sinner
Seasoned beginner
Lucky to be alive
I'm a sinner
Finished my dinner
Now I can go outside

If only yesterday took place tomorrow
I'd pray for sleep
And wake you and lift your head
So I can fix your hand I'll be your handyman

I'm not brittle I'm just a little
Scared of your temperament
I'm not brittle I'm just a little
Scared of my government
I'm not brittle
Head hurts a little
Staring up overhead
I'm not brittle
I'm just a riddle
Born of white, blue and red

If only yesterday took place tomorrow
I pray for sleep
And wake you and lift your head
So I can fix your hand I'll be your handyman
