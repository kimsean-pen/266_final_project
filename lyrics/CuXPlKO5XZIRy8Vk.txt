Like a beacon in the night
A boxer 'fore a fight
A tiger pacing the cage
Coming through as my own hero again
In the cracks I see the light
See the wuthering heights
A glimmer in the silver lining
It's not busted, just bent

Oh, they say that it's a broken arrow
Well, just watch me as I shoot

There's a fire on the horizon and I'm the spark
I'm gonna shine, I'm gonna glow, I'm gonna burn
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust

There's a new sun and it's rising up from the dark
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna burn
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Ashes to ashes again

As the river flows to sea
I know I'll carry me
I'm the ship, I'm the wind, I'm the water
I am the final destination
Like the top of the mountain
Like a wishing well fountain
I am the luck of the draw
And not busted, just bent

Oh, they say that it's a broken arrow
Well, just watch me as I shoot

There's a fire on the horizon and I'm the spark
I'm gonna shine, I'm gonna glow, I'm gonna burn
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust

There's a new sun and it's rising up from the dark
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna burn
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Ashes to ashes again

I'm gonna live, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna burn
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust

Oh, they say that it's a broken arrow
Well, just watch me as I shoot

There's a fire on the horizon and I'm the spark
I'm gonna shine, I'm gonna glow, I'm gonna burn
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust

There's a new sun and it's rising up from the dark
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna burn
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Ashes to ashes again
