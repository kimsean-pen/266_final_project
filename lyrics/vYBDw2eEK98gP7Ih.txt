Talk to me
Tell me things you never said before
Let your heart be like an open door

Oh baby, talk to me

Tell me things
Open up and show me everything
I wanna know your world so let me in

Oh baby, just talk to me

You can shout across the rooftops
Scream until the world stops
And send it up in fireworks
Like a rocket 'cross the universe
There's no way I wanna miss a thing
If you need me, I'll be listening to you

All you gotta do
Is talk to me

Talk to me
Let me know about the things you feel
Every secret that your heart conceals

Oh baby, talk to me

You can shout across the rooftops
Scream until the world stops
And send it up in fireworks
Like a rocket 'cross the universe
There's no way I wanna miss a thing
If you need me, I'll be listening to you

All you gotta do
Is talk to me

Just talk to me
