Off this rocker
He's off his rocker
Please Mr officer I only had some vodka
Little marijuana just a few Vicadin
Only reefer surfin' out here where I'm driving
Where your registration, OG license
Because of that interior your bitch wanna ride this
(?) dick got low-jack
White hoes calling and they asking where the dope at
(?) Sinatra
I divide and conquer, rolling Willy Wonka
Baby momma wanna (?) at the concert
And they gets no pay like Frank Sinatra (?)

I'm so high, you're so high
If I take another sip, then I just might die
Take another sip then I just might lie
Tell her what she hear just to get between them thighs
Underground (?) world
So fuck what you say, do this shit my way
Like Frank Sinatra, bitch, do this shit my way

Take some vodka, sip slow rocka ock
Writ rhymes since the days with Frankie Crocker rock
From more stocky stock
Known for his illy right hook to make Rocky block
That's no poppy cock pirate
We can keep it irie, or we can keep it irate
Dilate
We keep it 100
From the hikes and all the lights
And Southern Comfort, muff it
Come with that headbanger boogie for that ass
Villain give a bully ten noogies for the cash
Dash, dip slow on a marathon
Or maybe he go sing Calypso like Farrakhan
Or Frank Sinatra mon
