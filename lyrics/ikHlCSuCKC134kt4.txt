Who was that, who was that?
Someone walked their feet through my house.
Who was that, who was that?
Someone sneaking quiet as a mouse.
Who was that, who was that?
Someone left their shoes on the stairs.
Who was that, who was that?
Laughing just like no one cares.

Someone in my house, I declare
Playing cards, solitaire
Who was playing in my house?
Someone in my kitchen, munching out
Peanut butter, there's no doubt
Who was eating in my house?

Someone took a bath, Mr. Bubble
Middle name, must be trouble
Who was playing in my house?
On the porch, right outside,
Here I come, you better hide
Who was hiding inside?

Who was that, who was that?
Someone walked their feet through my house.
Who was that, who was that?
Someone sneaking quiet as a mouse.
Who was that, who was that? Boy
Someone left the radio on
Who was that, who was that? Boy
One minute here, now he's gone.
