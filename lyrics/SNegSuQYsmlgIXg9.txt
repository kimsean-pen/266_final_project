Maybe something will change
Maybe something will change

Remember when you saw me on the street, then you looked to my eyes?
You helped me with the tire change
It had been a while and I had thought that you'd forgotten about me
I never could have forgotten you

I will reach you (I will reach you)
I will meet you (I will meet you)
I will meet you (I will-)
On your street
I won't let you down

Maybe something will change
Maybe something will change

A couple years later when I saw you making western moves
And palling around while I still saw in you
You always believed me, I've always believed in you
Let's not turn the page

I will reach you (I will reach you)
I will reach you (I will reach you)
I will meet you (I will-)
On your street
I won't let you down

I will meet you (I will meet you)
I will meet you (I will meet you)
I will meet you (I will-)
On your street
I don't want to let you down

Nothing will change
Nothing will change
Nothing will change
Nothing will change
