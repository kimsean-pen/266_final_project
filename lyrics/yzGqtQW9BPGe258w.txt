Waiting for the sun but i know that it'll come
I feel reborn when you touch my arm
Whole new view, feel better when i talk to you
I get scared with what i wear
And even when you yell i still love your belly
It's true
Riding it through the night
Straight through

It still feels new when i talk to you
I feel reborn when the sun gets warm
It's hard but i feel better when i'm not inside
I get scared you'll leave me soon
Even though we call each other every afternoon
It's true
It took a little time but i know you

I'm not bored at all
You can call me when you want to call

I used to want to show you every single line
Now it's hard for me to show you anything i write
I know that i get nervous when we're not alone
But i wait for you for hours when we're coming home
When we started talking i got so excited
And i swear i tried to go out every single night
I know that you will always be the one who's my

Spirit desire
Spend my time
Tell me that you're always going to be my life

I'm not bored at all
You can call me when you want to call
