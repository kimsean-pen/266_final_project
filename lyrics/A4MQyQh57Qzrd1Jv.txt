And I've been dragging the lake for dead kids,
While you were sleeping,
Crossing away the calendar,
Rotting away, into the ground,

Where you belong,
Where you belong,
Where you belong,
Where you belong,

Die...

I don't know what they said,
They all left me for dead,
And when I'm done,
God can have his way,
God can have his way,
God can have his way,
For now...

You,

And when I'm done,
God can have his way with me,
And when I'm done,
God can have his way with me,

So nail the casket one more time,

Nail the casket one more time,
I'm ready to go, baby,
Nail the casket one more time,
Now...

Nail the casket one more time,
I'm ready to go, baby,
Nail the casket one more time,

Twist the knife, it won't last forever,
Twist the knife, you know it won't, baby,
Twist the knife, it won't last,
Forever, forever more,

Yeah,
Go, go,

Forever...

Do not change the subject,
Let's go chase the sunset,
Bring me the horizon,
Bring me the horizon,
Now,

Twist the knife, it won't last forever,
Twist the knife, it won't last,
Forever, it won't last forever,
So nail the casket,
Now...
I...

I hate all my... friends,
I hate all my... friends,
I hate all my... friends,
I hate all my... friends,
I... hate all my friends,
Never forgive... them,
Never forgive... friends,
I hate all my... friends,
I hate all my... friends
