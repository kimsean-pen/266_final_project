Well we're trapped
In this human body
Yes I'm trapped
I've got no place else to go
And I can't even help my brothers
Cause there's still so much I don't know

I just need some time
To figure out
Time to figure out
Time to figure this thing out
I just needed some time

Well we're trapped
In this modern city
Yes I'm trapped
With this fancy drugs
And I can't even please my mother
Cause there's still so much that she don't know

I just need some time
To figure out
Time to figure out
Time to figure this thing out
I just needed some time

Oh I just need some time
Yes I could use some time
Oh do you have the time
This can't be all for nothing
But the smile is all that's on my face

Time to figure out
Time to figure out
Time to figure this thing out

Oh I could use some time
To figure out
Time to figure out
Time to figure this thing out
I just need some time
