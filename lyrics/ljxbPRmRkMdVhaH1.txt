I can lose a day
in a gothic maze.
Why do I wait when I know you've got a lover?

Barcelona crush
half-capped in the sun.
Why do I wait when I know you've got a lover?

The hands flail up in the clouds.
I am their king with the chemical crown.
Why do I wait, do I pace a figure-eight
ain't it easy to decide to go?

On stage I soak it in
and then I wring it out
Why do I wait when I know you've got a lover?
I'm floating over the crowd.
I'm crashing on your couch.
Why do I wait when I know you've got a lover?

Two at a time,
if you're gonna live your life you know.
Wasn't it crazy, the flooded city.
Caught eyes on a bridge like a sick cliche.
We saw the city float on and degrade.
I wrote my name on your arm and it stayed.
