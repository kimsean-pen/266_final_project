Werewolf in the night light, you won't believe your eyes
Blonde hair in the red light, she's getting down, getting down
She'll never turn me down, put another stake into my heart
There's evil in her eyes
I cheated death and I come back alive
Die and rise, and take a bite of life
Die and rise, with no regrets
Die, die
Black queen in the mirror, she's pulling me aside
One those of the white light, I'm shutting out, shutting out
I want to wake you up in the middle of a perfect dream
Adrenaline inside
I cheated death and I come back alive
Die and rise, and take a bite of life
Die and rise, with no regrets
Die, die
Risorger√≤ in ogni momento poiche
So le che la vita si tramutera
Die and rise, and take a bite of life
Die and rise, with no regrets
Die, die
