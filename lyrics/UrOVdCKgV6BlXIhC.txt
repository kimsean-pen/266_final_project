Demon, come live in me
possession, fill me with disease
temptation, a fire set aflame
feral instincts help me go insane

Shameless, searching endlessly
to appease the burning urge in me
hunger of a thousand wolverines
satisfaction by any means

Demon, replace all I've been taught
impulse, erase all second thought
gambling in this carnal game
nothing is all where everything's the same

Trembling in the balance
exploring new extremes
all sweet forms of self-destruction
coming to me in my dreams

Thoughts of cruelty and pain
in my brain - in my blood
lose control of lust and anger
