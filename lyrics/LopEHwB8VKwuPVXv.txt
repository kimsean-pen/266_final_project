Oh baby,
I was born with a fast fuse
I got no time to be loved,
Just a city to abuse
Oh baby,
I was born with a fast fuse
I got no time to be loved,
Just a city to abuse

Oh, come get me,
With your files don't arrest me
I'm Lucifer's child, wild, acids done
Black sunglasses shade the morning sun

So come get me,
All you fuckers can't touch me
I'm a hooligan choir, sire,
Sit don't scatter
It don't matter
Get me one, two, three

Gold lightning in the skyline
Gold lightning in the sky

Oh baby,
I was born with a fast fuse
I got no time to be loved,
Just a city to abuse
Oh baby,
I was born with a fast fuse
I got no time to be loved,
Just a city to abuse

Vultures circle round,
They wait above the ground

Oh, how dare you?
Now it's time to address you
I'm the reason you came,
Shame, stroke my mane
See my fist chopping up your reign

It's getting hotter,
Now I'm spitting out lava
I'm the Spaniard in the works, jerks,
Genuine stock
Hear that bomb going tick, tick, tock

Gold lighting in the skyline
Gold lighting in the sky
Gold lighting in the skyline
Gold lighting in the sky

Oh baby I was born,
With a fast fuse,
I got no time to be loved,
Just a city to abuse

In the middle of the night,
When they come for you,
Where you gonna be?
What you gonna do?

Heaven may come
And heaven may call
But I won't be there
Heaven may come
And heaven may call
But I won't be there
Heaven may come
And heaven may call
But I won't be there
Heaven may come
And heaven may call
But I won't be there
