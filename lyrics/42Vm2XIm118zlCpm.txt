Been having this feeling since I was a young boy
Running away from town
Been having this feeling since I was a young boy
No one slowing me down
Been having this feeling since I was a young man
Running away from town
Been having this feeling since I was a young man
No one slowing me down

Been having this feeling since I was a young boy
Running away from town
Been having this feeling since I was a young boy
No one slowing me down
Been having this feeling since I was a young man
Running away from town
Been having this feeling since I was a young man
No one slowing me down

Who really cares if I'm such a narcissist?
I don't make it there when you're not around
I dont want to talk about my feelings
Just wana try

Here we are
Oh we yean to surrender in the arms
Of a thousand trees
away, in the sunset
