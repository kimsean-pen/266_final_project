I could pretend that I was okay
I wind around the parties, drink in hand
I could pretend when you went away
That I had changed and I no longer hear the band

But I won't lie
I found a love
I had to rediscover
I was emotionally scarred we could not get it away
There are times when it breaks and I feel amazed

Feels just like the first time when you kiss me, my lover
Angels in the sky will descend on our love
And it's hard to deny what is happening
Although we talk, talk, talk on the telephone
We laugh, laugh, laugh at the things we know

I've been a soldier for much too long
I'd willingly surrender all my arms
If you decided you won't be long
I'd wait here patient for you
Look for you every morning

Had this love
These were sparks
We tried to push it on but
I was afraid of the dark
We could not get it away
Never mind what they say
I would feel the same

Feels just like the first time when you kiss me, my lover
Angels in the sky will descend on our love
And it's hard to describe what is happening
Although we talk, talk, talk on the telephone
We laugh, laugh, laugh at the things you know

If I could choose then my heart would be in it,
My charms would be in it,
My love would be in it

Feels just like the first time
