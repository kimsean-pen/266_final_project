(T. James/Chimes)
I'm on a helicopter ride through Vietnam. I'm the Leicester Square
kid I'm superman. I'm putting weight for the Oscar. Man gonna
get through anyway I can. Everywhere everyone is red and green.
I gotta lust for glory and a tape machine. I'm living out Frank
Coppola's dreams. Outta my mind I'm feelin' mean. I'm Nuremberg
Stepper blowin' wets away. I gotta headful of Hendrix, I'm feelin'
OK. I'm a late night thriller, I'm miss La Ray. Outta my mind
can I come to play?
Hey hey hey we're in the movie. I feel up and I feel groovy.
Let's go out and get some of that. Gimme gimme gimme some Russian
Roulette. La la la... I said hey.
