We favor the simple expression of the complex thought
We are for the large shape
Because it has the impact of the unequivocal

We are for flat forms
Because they destroy illusion and reveal truth

The artist was attempting to make art more
Than something to just look at
They wanted it something to be involved in
Something too big to ignore

It is our function as artists
To make the spectator to see the world our way
Not his way
