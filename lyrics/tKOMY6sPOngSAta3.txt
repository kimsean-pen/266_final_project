Thrown away
In the dark of night
Casting shadows
There is no light
The things we said
Are all but dead
Depressing visions
Cloud my head

A broken heart
That will never mend
The scars of life, they'll never end
The hopes and fears
The lies and tears
Withdrawel is hard
The pain it grows

This shadow plays
A tear on my soul
This faceless hope
Nowhere to go
I was waiting for you with open arms
No goodbyes
The pain lives on

Searching for you
In disbelief
As dawn approaches
There is no peace

This shadow plays
A tear on my soul
This faceless hope
Nowhere to go
I was waiting for you with open arms
No goodbyes
The pain lives on

Searching
Searching for you
I'm hoping you will too
Searching
Searching for you
I'm hoping you will too
