Night was young, we were growing up
Yeah, I know but I don't know enough
Now it's late, just got back from work
You don't have to put it into words

Ooh wee
Send me an emoji, let me know how you feel
Ooh wee
Send me an emoji, -ji, -ji (hey)
Ooh wee
Send me an emoji, let me know how you feel
Ooh wee
Send me an emoji, -ji, -ji (hey)

Ooh wee
Ooh wee
Send me an emoji, -ji, -ji

Left your weed in my vanity
Only hit it when it's hard to sleep

One more glass of tequila poured
If you were here we'd have a couple more
Souvenirs you left in my draw
Got them Princess Leia braids you wore
Left your weed in my vanity
Only hit it when it's hard to sleep

Ooh wee
Send me an emoji, let me know how you feel
Ooh wee
Send me an emoji, -ji, -ji (hey)
Ooh wee
Send me an emoji, let me know how you feel
Ooh wee
Send me an emoji, -ji, -ji (hey)

Ooh wee
Ooh wee
Send me an emoji, let me know how you feel
