Advice, bruddah want advice
That's pressure on my iris man, that's pressure on my eyes
That's pressure on my sinus, now there's pressure on my mind
See I put pressure on my peers,
that they put pressure on them diamonds
Wait, lies, tellin' all these lies
Man got all these guns and knives and man got all these wives
Man got all this clientele to buy and sell these nines
Kilos, these bars, q's, 3-5's
Most guys spend ages just wasting their time
These times I'm time saving, chasing what's mine
Can't be celebrating 'til the wages getting wide
They getting wide off their wages, celebrating for the night
You're choosing to be hype, while I cruise into that drive
Man got two cents I don't care about, it's all nuisance when he rhyme
But these youtdem a don't write, I gotta say free mandem inside
Gotta say these relevant rhymes that
I spit, teach eloquence fine (so fine)
Look him in the face, who ya tryna be?
I ain't tryna copy man, I'm out 'ere doing me
Talking 'bout they're barking but they're hardly with the teeth
Who me? Garn then, garn then
Really I'm a master of the wave, just a master of my craft
Not a jack of every trade
Little carcass in their car, suttin earlier I've made
See I drop a little bar and leave them burning from the spray
Really win the race, yours are right I'm on the road
So they pree the way I'm walking and they copy with a stroll
Little did they know that I just manifest the goal
And if they get up in my way I may just manifest the pole
Swing it in your face, swing it in your jaw
Look at all the teeth, spinning on the floor
Had a second thought, before he hit the floor
But it's to late for all them
things, ca' you brought drama to the door
Look him in the face, who ya tryna be?
I ain't tryna copy man, I'm out 'ere doing me
Talking 'bout they're barking but they're hardly with the teeth
Who me? Garn then, garn then
It's intrinsic, Wiz win
This dim nitwits drip diction, this year I might end this kids
Get them two cheap big bits, put them in the pocket
And then send them to your guy, fall for the profits your dissing
Ey listen fickle fam, pick another cell, pick another gang
Pick another girl, pick another world
You are not aloud here little man
Mandem on the road fully know Wizzy, I walked in hella dough with me
I rolled out and I stretched out and I
growed that ca' the whole scene wanna fuck with me
I know dat and I love dat and I'll hold that fully close to me
There's ten a penny that are scoping
me, there little bars are a joke to me
I feel a fine kind of form coming
on, I wouldn't wanna be approaching me
I wouldn't wanna be a wasteman, Wizzy wouldn't wanna be a nobody
I'm a winner, wouldn't wanna be a window washer
While they wanna wheel,
I wouldn't wonder why I'm waking up or
why the demographic do a sicker version
I'm a problem on them mandem, mandem manna know me
Well I'm in it for the millie,
believe in my self and I'm killing it really
My fan dem are feeling me, big in the city
Man never come really, the way that I came with the villain
I showed everybody that I'm lyrically
silly, I bet 'em a billy but top of the bill
And I bet him a bill he weren't better than Wizzy
Them man ain't even relevant evidently, we're ahead of the resident
Partly because of the physical regiment,
mainly because of the whit and intelligence
Tellin' them turn up, I'll turn up, I'll turn it in
Turn up for dinner whilst I'm eating venison looking all elegant
I'm in my element,
if you are levelling where is the evidence nobody deading
Your militant meaning I'm overly permanent, venomous
Meaning promoters are overly generous
Meaning I'm getting my bill without benefit
Hell of a life I've been living, I'm loving the life I've been living
I live for the hell of it, moving all menacing
I be the nemesis, overly devilish
Why you embellishing? Look at the heavy ting
Move like a wedding ring, hereditary
Wizzy benevolent, look at my property nearly got ten of 'em
I know they are listening, Wizzy be shelling 'em
Them man are uppity nobody belling 'em
They're talking like they really want
it when I see them mandem in the flesh
Everybody wanna comment on how the lyric Wizzy dropping be the best
Eenie meanie minie wouldn't even matter spinning Wizzy on the deck
Everybody wanna see the Wizzy, when the Wizzy walking on the step
Look him in the face, who ya tryna be?
I ain't tryna copy man, I'm out 'ere doing me
Talking 'bout they're barking but they're hardly with the teeth
Who me? Garn then, garn then
