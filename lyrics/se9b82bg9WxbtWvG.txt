This radio station was named Kowalski
In honor of the last American hero to whom
Speed means freedom of the soul
The question is not when he's gonna stop
But who is gonna stop him

Like Kowalski in the vanishing point
Kowalski in the vanishing point
Kowalski in the vanishing point
Vanishing point, vanishing point
Vanishing point

Like a butterfly on a pin
Like a butterfly on a pin
Soul on ice
Soul on ice
Soul on ice
Soul on ice

What sounds good?
What sounds good?
What you need? Speed
Lighten up before

There goes the challenger being chased by the
Blue, blue, meanies on wheels
The vicious traffic squad car
Right after our lone driver
The last American hero
The, the electric centaur, the demi God
The super driver of the golden west

Two nasty Nazi cars are close behind
The beautiful lone driver
The police numbers are getting closer, closer
Closer to our soul hero, in his soul mobile
Yeah baby, they're about to strike
They're gonna get him, smash him
Rape the last beautiful free soul on this planet

Vanishing point
Vanishing point
Vanishing point
Vanishing point

Soul on ice
Soul on ice
Soul on ice
Soul on ice
Soul on ice
Soul on ice
Soul on ice

Hello Kowalski
Hello Kowalski
Hello Kowalski
