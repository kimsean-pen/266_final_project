Run out on the rocks with me
Get rid of your socks, and toss back time like shots with me
Nothing loved is lost
Connect all these dots with me
I know you see like me
Constellations, connecting like hidden shapes in the sky
And so it goes, you and I
A walk through the wild is all it's gonna cost
But nothing really loved is lost
