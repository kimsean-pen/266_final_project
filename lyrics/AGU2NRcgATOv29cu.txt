We're charging our battery
And now we're full of energy

We are the robots, we are the robots
We are the robots, we are the robots

We're functioning automatic
And we are dancing mechanic

We are the robots, we are the robots
We are the robots, we are the robots

Ja tvoi sluga, Ja tvoi rabotnik
Ja tvoi sluga, Ja tvoi rabotnik

We are programmed just to do
Anything you want us to

We are the robots, we are the robots
We are the robots, we are the robots

We're functioning automatic
And we are dancing mechanic

We are the robots, we are the robots
We are the robots, we are the robots

Ja tvoi sluga, Ja tvoi rabotnik
Ja tvoi sluga, Ja tvoi rabotnik

We're functioning automatic
And we are dancing mechanic

We are the robots, we are the robots
We are the robots, we are the robots

We are programmed just to do
Anything you want us to

We are the robots, we are the robots
We are the robots, we are the robots

We are the robots, we are the robots
We are the robots, we are the robots

We are the robots, we are the robots
We are the robots, we are the robots
