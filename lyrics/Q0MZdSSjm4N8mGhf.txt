Your baby doesn't love you any more

Golden days before they end
Whisper secrets to the wind
Your baby won't be near you any more

Tender nights before they fly
Send falling stars that seem to cry
Your baby doesn't want you any more, it's over

It breaks your heart in two, to know she's been untrue
But, oh, what will you do when she says to you
"There's someone new, we're through, we're through "

It's over, it's over, it's over

All the rainbows in the sky
Start to weep then say goodbye
You won't be seeing rainbows anymore

Setting suns before they fall
Echo to you that's all, that's all
But you'll see lonely sunsets after all

It's over, it's over
It's over, it's over
