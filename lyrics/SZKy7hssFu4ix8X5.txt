You have become what you have always been
light flickering around, peripheral vision
no words we can speak, our paths have been chosen
but all trails that we trek,
-should lead us back to here because our
love comes again
just when i've broken down i found
love can come again
you've got to believe that
love comes again
just when i've broken down i found
love can come again
dig within me, turn all the secret stones
forests and fields, breathing with blood and bones
still no words we can speak, our paths have been chosen
but all trails that we trek,
-should lead us back to here because our
love comes again
just when i've broken down i found
love can come again
you've got to believe that
love comes again
just when i've broken down i found
love can come again
