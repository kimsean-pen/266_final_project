It's like you're tryin' to get to Heaven in a hurry
And the queue was shorter than you thought it would be
And the doorman says, "You need to get a wristband"

You got a lift between the pitfalls
But you're lookin' like you're low on energy
Did you get out and walk to ensure you'd miss the quicksand?

Looking for a new place to begin
Feeling like it's hard to understand
But as long as you still keep pepperin' the pill
You'll find a way to spit it out, again
And even when you know the way it's gonna blow
It's hard to get around the wind

Stretchin' out the neck on your evenin'
Tryin' to even out some deficit
But it's saber tooth multi-ball confusion

And you can shriek until you're hollow
Or whisper it the other way
Tryin' to save the youth without puttin' your shoes on

Looking for a new place to begin
Feeling like it's hard to understand
But as long as you still keep pepperin' the pill
You'll find a way to spit it out, again
And even when you know the way it's gonna blow
It's hard to get around the wind

I can hear you through my window
But I'm never quite sure who is who
But they want the world
On a dessert spoon

It always sounds like they're fightin'
Or as if that's what they're about to do
It might not hurt now
But it's goin' to hurt soon
