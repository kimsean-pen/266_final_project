It looks so easy,
Being trapped inside this head of mine.
Disturbing dreams, and haunted beings they control my mind

Dark desires fuel the fire suffocating i can't breath.
Bet you'de love to see me burn, so move aside or come with me.

I will always be a tortured soul
Don't fix me up, just let me go.
Come join me if you like
I'll be on the other side

How did i end up this way?
How did i end up addicted to pain and suffering?
I have sealed my fate

Dark desires fuel the fire suffocating i can't breath.
Bet you'de love to see me burn, so move aside or come with me.

I will always be a tortured soul
Don't fix me up, just let me go.
Come join me if you like
I'll be on the other side

I have a slight confession
I brought this on myself
Will never learn my lesson
I know what i've become
Come with me.
I will always be a tortured soul
Don't fix me up, just let me go.
Come join me if you like
I'll be on the other side
