Dark
Out on the street there's a light at the end where we
Start
Lightning above us is crashing in place of a spark

And we are consumed
I found out it was you
And our hearts run true
with what we're meant to do

Grace
Came back to me with the answer I saw on your
Face
All of the questions remained as we fell into place

And we are consumed
I found out it was you
and our hearts run true
With what we're meant to do

And we are consumed
I found out it was you
And our hearts run true
With what we're meant to do

And we are consumed
I found out it was you

And we are consumed
I found out it was you
And we are consumed
I found out it was you
and our hearts run true
with what we're meant to do
