I want to tell you there's nothing
Nothing to fear about me darling
I'm standing right here, believe me
Hold on honey if you're ready

I'll figure it out
I'll figure it out
I'll figure it out
I'll figure it out
I'll figure it out

You're still talking to the moon
Don't feel sorry for being you
I like the way you walk, babe
You know I like the way you make me feel

I'll figure it out
I'll figure it out
I'll figure it out
I'll figure it out
I'll figure it out
I'll figure it out
I'll figure it out
I'll figure it out
I'll figure it out
I'll figure it out
End
