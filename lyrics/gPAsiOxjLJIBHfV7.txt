You're in control
Pressing pause on my heartbeat
Someone stole all the air
So I can't speak now
I know the chase is on
I feel as though
My time has come

How many times do I fly
Through your head space
Now it's speeding away
From a safe place

Yeah your skin
Your touch the kiss
The rush too much
And here it comes

When your lips touch mine
It's the kiss of life
I know I know
That it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing
With lightning

We touch like
Like it's our first time
Oh oh
I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing
With lightning now

Just you and me and the
Coats in the back room
Learning things they don't
Teach in classroom

Now, you're here
And feel the fear
But everything is all so clear
I've been addicted to you
Since it first hit
Out of control like a surge of electric

Yeah, your skin
Your touch the kiss
The rush too much
And here it comes

When your lips touch mine
It's the kiss of life
I know, I know
That it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing
With lightning

We touch like
Like it's our first time
Oh oh
I know it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing
With lightning now

Your skin, your touch
The kiss, too much
Your skin, your touch
The kiss, the rush
Your skin, your touch
The kiss, too much
The rush, the rush
The rush, the rush

When your lips touch mine
It's the kiss of life
I know, I know
That it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing
With lightning
We touch like
Like it's our first time
oh oh
I know it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing
With lightning now
