I been lookin' for someone
Between the fire and the flame
We're all lookin' for somethin'
To ease the pain

Now who can you turn to
When it's all black 'n' white
And the winners are losers
You see it every night

I need somebody
Somebody like you
Everybody needs somebody

I need somebody
Hey what about you
Everybody needs somebody

When you're out on the front line
And you're watchin' them fall
Doesn't take long to realize
It ain't worth fightin' for

I thought I saw the Madonna
When you walked in the room
And your eyes were like diamonds
And they cut right through - Oh they cut right through

I need somebody
Somebody like you
Everybody needs somebody

I need somebody
Hey what about you
We all need somebody

Another night another lesson learned
It's the distance that keeps us sane
But when the silence leads to sorrow
We do it all again - all again
I need somebody
Somebody like you
Everybody needs somebody
I need somebody
Hey what about you
Everybody needs somebody
