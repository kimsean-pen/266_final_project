(A Lau on the beat)
If so, let me know
You're so high, high

You're so high
Let me know, how high
We can go high, high
We can go high, high

We can go high, high
We can soar, how high?
Let you know how high
If you hit my phone, yah, yah
But don't hit my phone, yah, yah
Bitch just leave me 'lone, yah, yah
I've been in the zone, yah, yah
For the ones that know, yah, yah, yah

If so, let me know
If so, let me know
If so, let me know
If so

You're so high
Let me know, how high
We can go high, high
We can go high, high

We can go high, high
We can soar, how high?
Let you know how high
If you hit my phone, yah, yah
But don't hit my phone, yah, yah
Bitch just leave me 'lone, yah, yah
I've been in the zone, yah, yah
For the ones that know, yah, yah, yah

Let me know
Let me know
Let me know
