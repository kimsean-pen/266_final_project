So we started off in the heat of the sun
Getting all our holidays at once
From afternoons, we stay out to the light's gone
And we carried on to the beat of our drum
Bring unaware the time was up
Colours change and day turns into nighttime
Love is a weapon!
Life is a war!
Enter the number!
Wait on the phone!
Living in Napoli but not believing we're living
Hold me now, indoor firework
Call it there, indoor firework
I can picture you by the side of the road
In the sodium light, in winter clothes
I said goodbye, and held you for the last time.
I didn't know back then you were letting me go
Our names were written in the snow
I still believed the day could last a lifetime.
Love is a weapon!
Life is a war!
Enter the number!
Wait on the phone!
Living in Napoli but not believing we're living
Hold me now, indoor firework
Call it there, indoor firework
Hold me now, indoor firework
Call it there, that's the way you work
I feel it coming
I know it's coming out of there
I feel it coming
I feel it coming through the mist at night there
Hold me now, indoor firework
Call it there, indoor firework
Hold me now, indoor firework
Call it there, that's the way you work
