I had a dream that all of time was running dry
And life was like a comet falling from the sky
I woke so frightened in the dawning, oh, so clear
How precious is the time we have here

Are we not wise enough to give all we are
Surely we're bright enough to outshine the stars
But human kind gets so lost in finding its way
But we have a chance to make a difference til our dying day

And you might pray to God or say it's destiny
But I think we're just hiding all that we can be

Are we not wise enough to give all we are
Surely we're bright enough to outshine the stars
But human kind gets so lost in finding its way
We have a chance to make a difference til our dying day

All I'm really asking is, what are we doing here
Are we just killing time just living year to year
In this big world, no one else can play our part
Ain't it time to just wake up and give it all

Are we not wise enough to give all we are
Surely we're bright enough to outshine the stars
But human kind gets so lost in finding its way
We have a chance to make a difference til our dying day

We have a chance to make a difference till our dying day
We have a chance to make a difference till our dying day
