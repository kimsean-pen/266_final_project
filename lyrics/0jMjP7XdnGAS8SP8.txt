Sometimes I wonder
Who's keeping you
You're pillow's so dry
Lonely lonely night
It's all i can do
Just to keep you from crying
Well, it's all i can do
Just to keep you satisfied

Now you pick up all the love
When the push comes to shove
See you had about enough
But, you still call my bluff

Well I done, done my time
And I'm done asking why
You won't see me cry
See me cry
Sweet darlin', not one single tear over you

Sometimes I tremble
Sometimes I shake
She lead me straight
On the freight train to heartache
It's all I can do
Just to keep you from cryin'
It's all I can do
Just to keep you satisfied

Now you pick up all the love
When the push comes to shove
See you had about enough
But, you still call my bluff

Well I done, done my time
And I'm done asking why
You wont see me cry
See me cry
Yeah, see me cry
Sweet darlin', not one single tear over you

You should be my soul
Every other night
For your weepin' eyes
When your tears came rolling down
Just a bit of love keep you warm
Now we spoke tongue to tongue
Still you slowly watch me drown

Well I done, done my time
And I'm done asking why
You wont see me cry
See me cry
Yeah, see me cry
Sweet darlin', not one single tear over you

Sometimes I wonder
Who's keepin' you
Your pillow's so dry
Through the lonely, lonely night
It's all i can do
Just to keep you from crying
Well, it's all i can do
Just to keep you satisfied

Now you pick up all the love
When the push comes to shove
See you had about enough
But you still call my bluff

Well I done, done my time
And I'm done asking why
You wont see me cry
Yeah, see me cry
Sweet darlin', not one single tear over you
