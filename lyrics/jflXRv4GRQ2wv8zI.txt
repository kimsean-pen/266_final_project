Touch me as I fall apart
All over you on the floor
I wish that we could go back to the stars
But every wound is salty, every memory scarred
Naked, standing here defeated
Triggering words and settling scores
Is it not shameful the ways that we fought
Forgive me I'm a failure when it comes to your heart

I am sorry, I'm just a human
And I made a mistake
Only miss it when I know I lost it
Only bend when it breaks
But it's not just me who has been faulty
Not just you who's in pain
Cause everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody bleeds the same
Everybody bleeds the same
Everybody bleeds the same
Everybody bleeds the same

Stripped of, [?], on my knees
Could only word flex until we're not [?]
Hey, can we put the weapons down
Cause everyone is falling in the standing grounds
Too late to say we don't need it
Oh, we cannot take back the damage we've caused
We cut too close and we push too far
Forgive me I'm a failure when it comes to your heart

I am sorry, I'm just a human
And I made a mistake
Only miss it when I know I lost it
Only bend when it breaks
But it's not just me who has been faulty
Not just you who's in pain
Cause everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody bleeds the same
Cause everybody
Everybody bleeds the same
Cause everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody bleeds the same
Cause everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody bleeds the same
