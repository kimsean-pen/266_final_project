I had a bad reaction to your feared public hobby writings
Cover your breath, cover your teeth
I get no satisfaction from your very recent sightings
Cover your breath, polish your speech
Cover your breath, cover your teeth
Cover your breath, polish your speech
Like when I hear a sound of feet slapping on the runway
Cover your breath, polish your speech
Like a small bird pretty while it's crapping on a new day
Cover your breath, polish your teeth
Cover your breath, polish your speech

So disappointed I was that I had made small talk with you
Polish your teeth, alter your breath
I'm not feeling your buzz, I only smell your crack of stew
Alter your teeth, cover your breath

She had some beauty of manners, but she looked like a bug
Cover your breath, alter your speech
Migrations of their type are such good planners and not smug
Cover your breath, alter your speech

You are proselytizing alone listening to the voice with your ears
Cover your breath, cover your teeth
You have regurgitated the tone, now sat in your tract for many years
Cover your breath, polish your speech
Picked up from dead things that You licked
It's a feedback loop you can't evict
Cover your breath, polish your teeth
Polish your teeth, cover your breath
Alter your teeth, cover your breath
Cover your breath, alter your speech
