Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Never came around to make this house into a home
Put you on a pedestal and sat you on a throne
I find all your skeletons, a closet full of bones
I see you take pride in bloody eyes, I know you're stoned

I can hear resentment in your tone
Said I'd never make it on my own
Maybe I'm just better off alone, too numb to deal
Too numb to feel the knife in my back

Judas
Oh, oh, Judas
Judas
Oh, oh, Judas

I can see you coming from about a mile away
In the mystique, your pretentiousness is fading
Reminiscing all the backwards ways you made me stay
Begging me for thread, I think you need to change your brain

I can hear resentment in your tone
Said I'd never make it on my own
Maybe I'm just better off alone, too numb to deal
Too numb to feel the knife in my back

Judas
Oh, oh, Judas
Judas
Oh, oh, Judas

I need to make an effort, this should be effortless
Nothing can last forever, and you're such a pessimist
I was your prized possession, and who was your exorcist?
Thought you was heaven sent, you left for the hell of it

I can hear resentment in your tone
Said I'd never make it on my own
Maybe I'm just better off alone, too numb to deal
Too numb to feel the knife in my back

Judas
Oh, oh, Judas
Judas
Oh, oh, Judas

Eh, eh, eh, eh
