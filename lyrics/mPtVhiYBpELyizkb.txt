Underneath the leaves where the blackbirds turn blue
If there's room for me
There's room for you
Place your ear to the ground, you hear a voice
It sings the song
The whole night long
I am the melody of the fallen tree
What comes between me
You and me
So sadly transient, you'd never guess
It could ever be
So easy to see

Across a frozen field you hear a call
With the urgency
Of the boiling sea
All your hopes and dreams they rise and fall
Secretly
A cacaphony
The love and brutality
They all turn on me
You hope to someday see
Patiently
So sadly obvious, you'd never guess
It could ever be
So hard to see
