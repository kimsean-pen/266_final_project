Though i walk through valley after valley after valley
And find only shadows
Though i walk and find only shadow
The sun falls behind the yew bushes
I young in different shapes stand next to them
The old chapel is to my right
The shadows then lengthen and there again the long shadows fall

When i saw the shadows and starres fall around me as a boy
I knew this world
All we see
Be
And are
Is imperium
Empire of Nothing
