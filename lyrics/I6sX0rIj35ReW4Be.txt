North of the yew grove
One mountain was crowned
With glory and steel

Shining beacon of wealth
Home of the prosperous
High Princess of Noreia

One man
To fight on the blood-red mountainside
One man
To vanquish the rapacious beast

One fateful day it appeared
That colossal and furious boar
To feed on our sacred lands
A swath of destruction
Was all that remained

Iron swords were raised in vain
Asunder burst our lightning spears
Oppressed and stricken we languished in fear
Until he rose...

One man
To fight on the blood-red mountainside
One man
To vanquish the rapacious beast
One man
To end the age of distress
One man
To fullfil the prophecy enthean

The conqueror stepped forth
As it is also told in the legend of Calydon
He laid the boar onto its shoulders
And the people had acclaimed him Virunus

Vir! Vir! Vir! Vir! Vir! Vir! Vir! Vir!

North of the yew grove
One man stepped forth
To challenge the beast

The father of this town
Home of the prosperous
High Princess of Noreia

One man
To fight on the blood-red mountainside
One man
To vanquish the rapacious beast
One man
To end the age of distress
One man
To fullfil the prophecy enthean
