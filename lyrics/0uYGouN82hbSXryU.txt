Don't get too close - that place is haunted.
Fear not the ghosts, 'cause she sent them running.

She sleeps beneath the surface
Consorting with serpents
She strikes without a purpose.
A dark face in a corridor, deceptively beautiful.
She's watching you, she's in everything you do.
Her kiss it tastes so sweet but left me with a lethargy I couldn't shake
I'd made a grave mistake.

I gave her my heart, she didn't want it
Took it anyway and put a dark spell on it.
Since then I haven't been the same.
Needed a victim and she got it
Took me in with her song, powerless to stop it.
Some men don't dare to speak her name.

She picked me up from my decline, healed my wounds with love and wine
Dosed me up and closed my eyes - a taste of poison.
She gave me all that I desired, sung the songs of angel choirs
Preached the words of death and fire and left me burning.

I gave her my heart, she didn't want it
Took it anyway and put a dark spell on it.
Since then I haven't been the same.
Needed a victim and she got it
Took me in with her song, powerless to stop it.
Some men don't dare to speak her name.

She sleeps beneath the surface
Consorting with serpents
She strikes without a purpose.
