Darkening skies coming this way
Falling behind into nothing

But if you lead, I will follow
A thousand miles away
I will be your Apollo
Alone in outer space

Satellite, shine on me tonight
I will be your gravity, I will stay and never leave
My satellite, are you here tonight?
Shine your light and set me free
Take the darkness out of me
Shine on me
Shine on me

Blinded I wait, the end is forming
You are my fate, give me warning

If you lead, I will follow
A thousand miles away
I will be your Apollo
Alone in ou-

Satellite, shine on me tonight
I will be your gravity, I will stay and never leave
My satellite, are you here tonight?
Shine your light and set me free
Take the darkness out of me
Shine on me
Shine on me

Far across the emptiness I walk the night
And search the silence in the dark you left behind
I seek the stars above worlds to be the guides
But they all pale against the light in your eyes
In your eyes...
And I won't suppose to know why you walked away
But I can feel you pushing through beyond the space
So send your energy to me and I'll push through
Send your signal home and bring me back to you

Satellite, shine on me tonight
I will be your gravity, I will stay and never leave
My satellite, are you here tonight?
Shine your light and set me free
Take the darkness out of me
Shine on me
Shine on me
