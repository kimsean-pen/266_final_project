Two faces on fire
No traces, something has swallowed the night
You know that nothing can make it all right, yeah

Like candy, emotion
Too much and sugar can turn to sand
You scream but nobody touches your hand

Are we just shouting at the pain
Or do we see just what we are
We're naked in the rain
Naked in the rain

Two children, guns loaded
Take aim and blow all the dreams away
Too late for anything better to say, hey

Are we just crazy with the pain
Or do we see just what we are
We're naked in the rain
Naked in the rain
Naked in the rain

Two faces, no fire
No traces, fever has turned to snow
Hearts break to show you the way as you go

Are we just running from the pain
Or do we see just what we are
We're naked in the rain
Naked in the rain
Naked in the rain
Naked in the rain

Two children on fire
Emotion burns higher
Guns loaded
Blow all the dreams away

Naked in the rain
Naked in the rain
Blinded by the pain
Naked in the rain
