(Verse)
I want too, away.
I am too away.

And when I say I go away and I can't stay
I know I'm done, I'm done.
And when you say stay awake and roll way
I know it's done, so done.

(Bridge)
I won't sit here,
I won't be here,
I won't take it,
I won't break it.
I won't sit here,
I won't be here,
I won't take it,
I won't break it.

Too away,
I'm too away.

I won't sit here,
I won't sit here,
I won't sit here, too.
