Remembering promises
Once made but now unspoken
Born of child like minds
These shadows of the past are now forsaken

From the dawn of your first day
To this death bed on which you lay
To survive we must comply
With the ritual of your life

Can you remember things we said
The dreams our expectations
Like ashes scattered in the wind
There is no recollection

Throughout the passing years
Faith will allay your fears
Follow the holy rites
In the ritual of your life

Life an endless ritual
Continuation perpetual

Throughout the passing years
Faith will allay your fears
Follow the holy rites
In the ritual of you life

Try to remember if you can
The pacts we made most solemn
Hands of time have brought decay
Those memories are forgotten

Now as you reach the end
All pain you must transcend
When you die you can't deny
The ritual of your life
