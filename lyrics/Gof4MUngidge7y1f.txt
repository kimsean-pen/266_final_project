Early this morning
When you knocked upon my door
Early this morning
When you knocked upon my door

And I said hello Satan, ah
I believe it is time to go
Me and the devil walkin' side by side
Me and the devil walking side by side

And I'm gonna see my man
Until I get satisfied
See, see, you don't see why
And you would dog me 'round

See, don't see why
People dog me around
It must be that old evil spirit
So deep down in your ground

You may bury my body
Down by the highway side
You may bury my body
Down by the highway side

So my old evil spirit
Can Greyhound bus that ride
So my old evil spirit
Can Greyhound bus that ride
