I keep on wondering why I can't say bye to you
And the only thing I can think of is the truth
It's hard to start over keep checking that rearview too
But something's coming
Something right for you
Just wait a bit longer
You'll find something you wanted
Something you needed
Something you want to have repeated
Oh, that feeling's all right
...

You'll find that if you listen
Between all the kissing
What made it work
Wound up missing
That seems about right
...

I guess I thought that we would always stay the same
...
And I can tell that you find somebody to blame
And I know in my heart in my mind it's all a game
Our hopes and wishes won't relight the flame
Just wait a bit longer

You'll find something you wanted
Something you needed
Something you want to have repeated
Oh, that feeling's all right
You'll find that if you listen between all the kissing
What made it work, wound up missing
Oh that seems about right.
You don't ever have to wonder
...
Cuz you will always know
That what we had was for sure ah for sure
Now that thing is no more, no more yeah

You'll find what you wanted
You'll find what you needed
You'll find what you wanted
You'll find what you needed
You'll find what you needed
