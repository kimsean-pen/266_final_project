Keep out the intruders! Put the drawbridge up!
The enemy ransacked what we had just rebuilt!
Now the garden lies in serene symmetry and severe color theory

Roots slowly poisoning through strategic seeds planted inside
We're much safer self-preserved, let the Dead Sea rise
No, the watch dogs aren't robots, they can't defend against their lures
Doors that weld shut behind you and books that fly like birds

Crushed by backpacks filled with ammo, luggage carts distracted the defense
And the troops sneak in undetected, charades begin, start the pretense
Obsessive thought in royal chambers invites Trojan warriors in
Little exceptions seem so harmless, little victories, little wins

And now why has the plan failed? We sit here aimless once again
With all units deployed fully, how is it we let him in?
All the corporals agreed, zero-tolerance enforced
But as cold as doorknobs were I somehow still opened the doors

Each battle lost is a mile gained on the terminal timeline
We all fear the last few inches but they're so far out, we're blind
Each battle lost...

A dysfunctional team, we are, no one following the rules
Yes I'll do my best to protect you but your disobedience intrudes
Skeletons escape the flesh
Like ants through tightly clenched fists
This time impeach the tyrant

What a contradictory statement â€“ suicidal self-preservationist
Although logic understands, prison chambers still exist
Chambers East and West conspiring, neighbors North and South unite
With the four working against me, I'm powerless and losing sight

Each battle lost is a mile gained on the terminal timeline
We all fear the last few inches but they're so far out, we're blind

This is a forced entry
This is the algometry
This is panophobic
Immunity gets sick

This is a forced entry
This is the algometry
This is panophobic
Taken down, brick by brick

This is a forced entry
This is the algometry
This is panophobic
This is the last conflict

Each battle lost...
Each battle lost...
