He's in love with rock 'n' roll, woah
He's in love with getting stoned, woah
He's in love with Janie Jones, woah
He don't like his boring job no...

He's in love with rock 'n' roll, woah
He's in love with getting stoned, woah
He's in love with Janie Jones, woah
He don't like his boring job no...

An' he know what he'd got to do
He know he's gonna have fun with you
Lucky lady!
But when the evening comes when his job is done

He'll be over in his car for you
He's in love with rock 'n' roll, woah
He's in love with getting stoned, woah
He's in love with Janie Jones, woah

But he don't like his boring job no...
In the in-tray lots of work
But boss at the firm always thinks he shirks
Be he's just like everyone he's got a Ford Cortina

That just won't run without fuel
Fill her up Jacko!
He's in love with rock 'n' roll, woah
He's in love with getting stoned, woah

He's in love with Jaine Jones, woah
But he don't like his boring job no...
An' the invoice if don't quite fit
There's no payola in his alphabetical file

'Cept for the government man
This time he's really gonna show the boss
Gonna really let him let him know exactly how he feels
It's pretty bad!
He's in love with rock 'n' roll, woah
He's in love with getting stoned, woah
He's in love with Janie Jones, woah
But he don't like his boring job no...
