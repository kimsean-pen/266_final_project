Yeah
Yeah

Gun under my bedsheets
Cracks all in my gold teeth
... all in my t-shirt
Rats all in my

Might pull the plug might catch
Might see your girl and might do my dance
Phone jumping on replay
She'll suck your dick and go
All my jeans got fresh tag

Fill up the cup and go crazy
69 with my baby

Might fuck your bitch
Might sip it slow might sip it quick
Might do my thing with that redbone

That scholarship and her headphones

Put my hands on your body
Whisper in my ear how you love me
White girl and my gold chains
We call that milk and honey

Taking care of my business

Might tie you up and go crazy
Might spend . check on Mercedes

All is well in my land
Diamonds all in my hand

...dripping in sauce

White girl and my gold chains
We call that milk and honey
