I see you walking down the street
I see you coming back inside
I know you're wondering what all this means to you
I know you're breaking down tonight
but do you know how much it hurts
to see you closing back that door

I love you love you love you
just the way you are
Love you love you love you
the way you are
There's nothing in this world that I would ever want
than to have you back in my arms.

I want to see you really smile
Do you know it's been a while
Have you noticed that you're far away from home
Do you like it where you are
Do they treat you like a star
Do they sing for you the songs you always liked

You're scared of all the lies
All you want is a sign
Telling you where to go
There's no other way to turn
The only lesson you learned
is to never forget your way back home

I love you love you love you
just the way you are
Love you love you love you
the way you are
There's nothing in this world that I would ever want
than to have you back in my arms.

Waiting for you
deep in the night
to tuck you into bed
I'm waiting for you
arms open wide
I want to see you smile tonight

Love you love you love you
just the way you are
Love you love you love you
the way you are
There's nothing in this world that I would ever want
than to have you back in my arms
