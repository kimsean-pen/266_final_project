I do dream you
Allow me to believe you are the real me
I see you breathing under water
See you on both sides of a door
I didn't mean you to fathom what you bought
I'm away and anywhere to suffice
Every life filled with what will be
If my own will is from me
How do I take another mirror
How do I drink the whole shore
I do greet you
And slam the door in your face
You come in anyways
It's a long, long time before this takes place
I answer these these questions now
As to why I'm the only one
Who carries answers to their fathers
Who carries gray sky to the sun
I'm not the railway
I leave all of it to the air
Passing highway's traffic just lying there
Carry me away
Come in anyways
Both sides of the door
The closed and open door
