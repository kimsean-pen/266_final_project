And if I had a boyfriend
I'd treat him so right
And if I had a boyfriend
I'd love him all night
And we can break your heart
So you see how i feel
I need a boyfriend
Or just anything real
And if I had a boyfriend
I'd tell him i care
And if I had a boyfriend
Well i'd cut his hair
And we can break your heart
so you see how i feel
I need a boy friend
or just anything real
And we can break your heart
so you see how i feel
I need a boy friend
or just anything real
And we can break your heart
so you see how i feel
I need a boy friend
or just anything real
And we can break your heart
so you see how i feel
I need a boy friend
or just anything real
