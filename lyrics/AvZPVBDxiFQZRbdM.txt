i can't see nothing' but spotlights
spotlights see nothing' but me
all of my music is lonely
yea, all of my heartaches were free
don't waste your time or your flash bulbs
too many heroes are dead
you like to live in the city
yea, i like to live in my head

somebody shoot out that spotlight
spotlights ain't nothing' but jive
roll me a smoke, and give me some coke
treat me like i am alive
tell all the ladies i'm single
tell lone star beer that i'm dry
everyone's lying' bout living'
i'm tired of living' a lie

i spend my nighttimes in mourning'
i spend my morning's alone
you spent your your money to see me tonight
yea, i spent all mine getting' stoned

now that they're both kinda busted
doesn't it seem kinda strange
that i lay down knowing we're two of a kind
and you'll leave here knowing my name
