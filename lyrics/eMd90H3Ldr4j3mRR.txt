Watch me, watch you, I have a colour for you.
Beautiful morning, your open eyes are calling.
Come on and reach me, come on and fly.
Well make us star, just falling night.
Everything old and everything new, I want know, know, know, know, know.
I want to know, if it's for me or you. I want to know, I want to know.
I'm on waiting a moment, in this hour, for us.
Imagine a second, in this minute, when we'll touch.
Do you hold me all night? With your hands and with your arms.
I needed you always, can you feel me? We can't stop.
I want to know.
I want to know, if it's for me or you. When I move a move, when I dance it's only for you, only for you.
When I move a move, when I dance it's only for you, only for you.
When I move a move. When I dance.
When I move a move. When I dance.
Watch me, watch you, I have a colour for you.
Beautiful morning, your open eyes are calling.
I want to know if it's for me or you End
