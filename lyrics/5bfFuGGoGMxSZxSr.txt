No I don't care what they want
I'll never be what you want me to be
(What you want me to be)
Don't give a fuck what you think
(Fuck you)
Just get the fuck away from me
(Away from me)

I swear I tried my best to ignore it all
(And walk away)
But it's too late
I want to spit the poison back in your face

No I don't care what they want
I'll never be what you want me to be
Don't give a fuck what you think
Just get the fuck away from me

That's the way of the world
They want to see you live on your knees
When you refuse to conform another door shuts (and)

No I don't care what they want
I'll never be what you want me to be
(What you want me to be)
Don't give a fuck what you think
(Fuck you)
Just get the fuck away from me
(Get the Fuck away from me)

Yeah you can beg all you want
Cause nothing is going to fucking change
You sealed your fate the day you crossed me

This is my message to a dying world
I fucking hate you
You'll get what you deserve

This is my message to a dying world
I fucking hate you
You'll get what you deserve
(DO YOU HEAR ME!?)

This is my message to a dying world
(YOU PIECE OF SHIT!)
I fucking hate you
You'll get what you deserve
(RUN, RUN!)

This is my message to a dying world
I fucking hate you
You'll get what you deserve

DO YOU HEAR ME NOW?!
