I am a poseur and I don't care, I like to make people stare
I am a poseur and I don't care, I like to make people stare

Exhibition is the name, voyeurism is the game
Stereoscopic is the show, viewing time makes it grow
Grow, grow, grow, grooow

I am a poseur and I don't care, I like to make people stare
I am a poseur and I don't care, I like to make people stare

My facade is just a fake, shock horror no escape
Sensationalism for the feed, caricatures are what you breed
Breed, breed, breed, breeeed

I am a poseur and I don't care, I like to make people stare
I am a poseur and I don't care, I like to make people stare

I am a poseur and I don't care, I like to make people stare
I am a poseur and I don't care, I like to make people stare

Anti-art was the start, establishments like a laugh
Yes we're very entertaining, overtones can be betraying
'tray, 'tray, 'tray, 'traaaying

I am a poseur and I don't care, I like to make people stare
I am a poseur and I don't care, I like to make people stare
I am a poseur and I don't care, I like to make people stare
I am a poseur and I don't care, I like to make people stare
