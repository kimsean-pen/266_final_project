Find yourself against the wall
One more time before the fall
There's no way to pretend
The sun will rise and the sun will set
Nothing's changed 'til you work for it
Can't make it all alone

This is your last chance
Why don't you take it?

Nothing can stop me
Gonna fight and I won't retreat
Still awake, don't ever sleep
Can't stop this tide that's in front of me
Nothing can stop me
Tonight I face the enemy
Still awake and never sleep
Now your time's run out so you best believe

When you feel you've had enough
Look how far that you have come
Just hold on 'til the end
When times are tough you take the pain
We'll fight together once again
You'll never be alone

This is your last chance
Why don't you take it?

Nothing can stop me
Gonna fight and I won't retreat
Still awake, don't ever sleep
Can't stop this tide that's in front of me
Nothing can stop me
Tonight I face the enemy
Still awake and never sleep
Now your time's run out so you best believe

You're out of time, just make the call
Can't see the writings on the wall
Claw yourself out to high ground
There's another way to ease the pain
Out of control yet once again
Realize and let it go

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
We're gonna stop this train, gonna end tonight
Don't care about what's wrong or right
We're gonna start again, start again tonight

This is your last chance
Why don't you take it?

Nothing can stop me
Gonna fight and I won't retreat
Still awake, don't ever sleep
Can't stop this tide that's in front of me
Nothing can stop me
Tonight I face the enemy
Still awake and never sleep
Now your times run out so you best believe
