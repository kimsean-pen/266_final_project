I wish I could see you for one last time
I wish I could say goodbye to you
It's hard to deal with you dying
It's time to say goodbye to you

Bloody-faced
Kissing
Walking through barbed wire
I'll let you go
Let me go
Digging through myself

I would die
Die for you
I walk right through barbed wire

Good luck in your next life
Walk as tall as the trees
Be gentle as spring winds
And have the warmth of the summer sun

Bloody-faced
Kissing death
Walking through barbed wire
I'll let you go
Let me go
Digging through myself

I would die
Die for you
I'd walk right through barbed wire
I blame myself for your death
It's tearing me apart

I would die
I'd die for you
Yes I would
Yes I would
Yes I would
Let you go
Let me go
Digging through myself

Bloody-faced
Kissing death
Walking through barbed wire.
