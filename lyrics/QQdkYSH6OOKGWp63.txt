I was king of all the asteroids
By far, New York city
I've been shooting up on moon dust
In there every single day

Better tell you I saw better plays
Up on the moon
Sometimes it gets so freaking cold
Like it was only bringin' in my room

My blood was boiling cold as ice
My skin grows equal dots of red
I've never felt so alone
I've never felt so alone

I was calling nightmares till they
Gave around a freak
I stepped into the shadow of the star
Reality

And love, love, loss, in the
In better spaces
That they listen to the sounds
On this radiowave

And no down love
You don't play into space
That they listen to our music
Baby, don't get it
