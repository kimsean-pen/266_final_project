The rabbit in his burrow observes the fog
Rise up from the soil and encircle the moss
She stands at the threshold of the dawn
Steps into the water and then she's gone

Only the stillness marks the shape
And where she once stood there is another in her place

Elemental forces
Gather in the heath
Where lavender and oakwood
Paths lead underneath
And phantoms dreaming sleeplessly
Stray far from crescents gleam
Unhumanly and lovely
Though their faces are never seen

Fairy song through marigolds
As wood ghosts ferry you along
The words they sing magnetically
Will bid you come back home
And darkness dwellers hidden in their lonely cloaks
Peek out from hooded moons
And watch as births of worlds evolve

Come back home
Come back home
Come back home
Come back home

Come back home (Come back home)
Come back home (Come back home)
Come back home (Come back home)
Come back home (Come back home)

Come back home (Come back home)
Come back home (Come back home)
Come back home (Come back home)
Come back home (Come back home)
