Can't nobody love you
Like I'm loving you, baby
Cause they don't know how
To love you like I do

Can't nobody love you
Like I'm loving you, baby
Cause they don't know how
To love you like I do

I'm gonna love you in the morning
Love you late at night
Girl, I ain't gonna stop loving
Til you tell me everything's alright

Can't nobody love you
Like I'm loving you right now
Cause they don't know how
To love you like I do

And oh, oh
Can't nobody love you
Like I'm kissing you, little girl
Cause they don't know how
To kiss you like I do

And let me tell you
Can't nobody talk to you
Like I'm talking to you right now
Cause they don't know how
To talk like I do, now listen

Sam bought you cake and ice cream
And he called you cherry pie
Ray Charles called you his sunshine
But you never mind

I ain't let nobody let love you
Like I'm loving you right now
Cause they don't know how
To love you like I do

No, they don't know how
To love you like I do
