Clouds of insecurity obscure me
Assure me
The mist of desperation
Dripping down my skin
The crushing storm will break me
And take me from this state I'm in

(Chorus:)
Everytime the rain comes calling
I can't stop myself from falling
Into the darkness - into the madness
Of a world devoid of fear and pain
Everytime it rains

The waves of isolation
Crash around me - around me
The loneliness of silence
Echoes in my brain
With shore in sight I'm under
And wonder why I fought in vain

(Chorus:)
Everytime the rain comes calling
I can't stop myself from falling
Into the darkness - into the madness
Of a world devoid of fear and pain
Everytime it rains
