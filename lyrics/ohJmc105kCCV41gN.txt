Is there a dark before the dawn?
Is this a problem or solution?
No, I can't tell what's right or wrong
Is there a consequence for all I've done?
Will I find sweet relief?

Enemies are tryna catch up
But nothing's gonna fuck with my love
Tired of erasing my history, history
Daddy said I never could win
That's probably why I never pretend
But good things are coming to me

Karma come over
Lean on my shoulder
Tell me what's good
I've been thinkin' about ya
Karma come over
(Karma come over)
Lean on my shoulder
(Lean on my shoulder)
Tell me what's good
I've been thinkin' about ya

So many questions in my life
Is every truth just an illusion?
Tell me I'm broken by design
So I can't see the beauty in my flaws
And find some peace of mind

Enemies are tryna catch up
But nothing's gonna fuck with my love
Tired of erasing my history, history
Daddy said I never could win
That's probably why I never pretend
But good things are coming to me

Karma come over
(Come over)
Lean on my shoulder
(On my shoulder)
Tell me what's good
(What's good)
I've been thinkin' about ya

Karma come over
(Karma come over)
Lean on my shoulder
(Lean on my shoulder)
Tell me what's good
(What's good)
I've been thinkin' about ya

I feel you chasing after me
The cold chill down my spine
There's no escape from destiny
Karma, karma, karma, karma
Karma, karma, karma, karma
Karma, karma, karma, karma
Karma, karma, karma, karma

Karma come over
(Come over)
Lean on my shoulder
(Lean on my shoulder)
Tell me what's good
(What's good)
I've been thinkin' about ya
Karma come over
(Karma come over)

Lean on my shoulder
(Lean on my shoulder)
Tell me what's good
(What's good)
I've been thinkin' about ya
Karma come over
(Come over)
Lean on my shoulder
(On my shoulder)
Tell me what's good
(What's good)
I've been thinkin' about ya
Karma come over
(Karma come over)
Lean on my shoulder
(Lean on my shoulder)
Tell me what's good
(What's good)
I've been thinkin' about ya
