don't fade away my brown eyed girl
come walk with me i'll fill your heart with joy
and we'll dance through our isolation
seeking solace in the wisdom we bestow
turning thoughts to the here and ever after
consuming fears in our fiery halos

say what you mean mean what you say
i've heard that innocence has led us all astray
but don't let them make you and break you
the world is filled with their broken empty dreams
silence is their only virtue
locked away inside their silent screams

but for now let us dance away this starry night
filled with the glow of fiery stars
and with the dawn our sun will rise
bringing a symphony of bird cries
don't bring me down now let me stay here for a while
you know life's too short let me bathe here in your smile
i'm transcending the fall from the garden
goodnight
