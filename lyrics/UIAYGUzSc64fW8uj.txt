One, two, three, well
I ran away from you
That's all I ever do
And though I started here
I ran away from you
I'm gonna come on in
And see it through

I ran away from you
That's all I ever do
And when I heard you close
Come back to me
And though I should stay
I don't have the stomach to

Everyone I know
Says I'm a fool to mess with you
And everyone I know
Says it's such a stupid thing to do
I have your love on call
And yet my belly is so full
There might be nothing left to do
So I ran away from you

When I come on in
My eyes are closed
I can feel it near
The sides so close
When come on out
And burn the sky

A star arose in my own cage
I stuck in line
And in a cage
Just a single star
I sing for

Everyone I know
Says I'm a fool to mess with you
And everyone I know
Says it's such a stupid thing to do
I have your love on call
And yet my belly is so full
And I did not know what to do
And so I ran away from you
