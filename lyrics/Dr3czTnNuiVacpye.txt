I don't wanna be difficult
At all
But let's just try it my way
I mean c'mon

I've showed you countless numbers of times
That I can do it (I can do it)
So for one time in your whole life
Just let me try it (let me try it)

I'm sick of being to-o-o-o-old
Of what I should kno-o-o-o-ow
I just wanna let go-o-o-o-o
I wanna run away just to live my life my way
Hey, wo-o-o-o-oah
Sick of being to-o-o-o-old
Wo-o-o-o-oah
Sick of being to-o-o-o-old

What's the harm
To have a little fun?
Been so uptight
I don't need to fight
I'm just, saying what

I've showed you countless numbers of times
That I can do it (I can do it)
So for just once in your whole life
Just let me try it (let me try it)

I'm sick of being to-o-o-o-old
Of what I should kno-o-o-o-ow
I just wanna go-o-o-o-o
I wanna run away just to live my life my way
Hey, wo-o-o-o-oah
Sick of being to-o-o-o-old
Wo-o-o-o-oah
Sick of being to-o-o-o-old

I see stars, you just see holes in the sky
You tell me you see it too, but I know that's a lie
I dream but then I just see the darkness of your eyes
I won't let you change me tonight

I'm sick of being to-o-o-o-old
Of what I should kno-o-o-o-ow
I just wanna let go-o-o-o-o
I wanna run away so I can live my life my way
Hey, wo-o-o-o-oah
Sick of being to-o-o-o-old
Wo-o-o-o-oah
Sick of being to-o-o-o-old

Wo-o-o-o-oah
Sick of being to-o-o-o-old
Wo-o-o-o-oah
Sick of being to-o-o-o-old
