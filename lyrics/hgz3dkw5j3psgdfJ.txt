There's a message floating in the air
Crazy horses riding everywhere

It's a warning
It's in every tongue
Gotta stop them crazy
Horses on the run

What a show, there they go
Smoking up the sky, yeah
Crazy horses all got riders
And they're you and I

Crazy horses
Crazy horses

Never stop and they never die
They just keep on puffin
How they multiply

Crazy horses
Will they never halt
If they keep on moving
Then it's all our fault

What a show, there they go
Smoking up the sky, yeah
Crazy horses all got riders
And they're you and I

So take a good look around
See what they've done
What they've done
They've done, they've done
They've done, they've done
They've done, they've done

Crazy horses
Crazy horses
Crazy horses
Crazy horses...
