I don't want to fight
just want a piece of your life
oh, if you come out to play
I don't want you to say... anything
I didn't feel a thing when you told me that
you didn't feel a thing when I told you that
I didn't feel a thing, another breakfast with you

I don't want to fight
just want a piece of your life
oh, if you come out to play
I don't want you to say... anything
I didn't feel a thing when you told me that
you didn't feel a thing when I told you that
I didn't feel a thing, another breakfast with you

Did you ever fall in love?
for a quarter of an hour or above?
