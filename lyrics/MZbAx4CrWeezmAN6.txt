Spin around, round, round me
Collide without a sound
Caught up in your gravity
I don't know how
Run away, way, way from me
The spirit only I can see
I need you now 'cause I don't know how

I don't know what, what

I was afraid of, I was afraid oooof...

Monster take me somewhere
Where I can save my breath in the air
We walk in shadow
Monster lead me home
Where there is no place to hide
Stranger on the other side
We walk in shadow

Monster lead me home

Monster lead me home

oh, ooh, ooh

oh, ooh, ooh
oh, ooh, ooh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
mmh... mmh... mmh... mmh

Now you surround, round, round me
Didn't think I could be found
Before we tear through the streets
Don't test the ground

A long way, way, way from comfort
Keep our back to the cold
I need you now 'cause I don't know how
I don't know what, what

I was afraid of, I was afraid oooof,
Monster take me somewhere
Where I can save my breath in the air
We walk in shadow
Monster lead me home

Where there is no place to hide
Stranger on the other side
We walk in shadow
Monster lead me home
Monster lead me home
ooh, ooh, ooh
oh, ooh, ooh
oh, ooh, ooh
oh, oh, oh, oh
...guiter plays...
ooh, ooh, ooh
oh, ooh, ooh
oh, ooh, ooh
oooow
Monster take me somewhere
Where I can save my breath in the air
We walk in shadow
Monster lead me home
Where there is no place to hide
Stranger on the other side
We walk in shadow
Monster lead me home
Monster lead me home
