I'm in the heart of winter
How I dread the spring
As the snow is falling down
Can't be locked forever
I keep remembering
Each day brings it closer now

Cry, cry to the beat of the band

He's gonna cry
Cry to the beat of the band
Break to the clap of the hands

I left the church in ruins
He didn't see me go
The congregation stared ahead
And so I kept on running
And by now he'll know
Bet he wishes I was dead

Never have I felt so cruel
But something had to give
Killing this deceitful love's
The only way we'll live

He's gonna cry
Cry to the beat of the band
Break to the clap of the hands

You're gonna cry
Cry to the beat of the band
Sing 'til the bitter end
You're gonna cry to the beat of the band

Heavy is the head that wears the veil
Heavy is the head that wears the veil
Heavy is the head that wears the veil
Heavy is the head

You're gonna cry
Cry to the beat of the band
Break to the clap of the hands
I'm gonna keep on running

Cry, cry to the beat of the band
Sing 'til the bitter end

You're gonna cry...
