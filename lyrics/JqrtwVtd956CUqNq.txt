The better then
To know myself
That fear be damned
And love be wealth
To sing it like
A mountain stream
To dance like no-one sees

That blinked an eye
That flashed a smile
But missed it by
A country mile
Now sleek to dive
In mirrored pools
And dance like no-one sees
So seize the day
Yeah ain't it true
We'll live the way
That lovers do
We'll go defenceless
Open wide
We'll let the senses
Be our guide
We'll break the surface
Snip these strings
Relearn the grace
Of selfless things
We'll dance like no-one sees
Dance like no-one sees
We'll dance like no-one sees

Now sleek to dive in mirrored pools
So sleek to dive in mirrored pools
In mirrored pools so sleek to dive
To kiss the face
To snip the strings
Relearn the grace
Of selfless things
Then sleek to dive
(Tonight we dance like no-one sees us)
So sleek to dive
And sleek to dive
(Tonight we dance like no-one sees us)
So sleek to dive
Then sleek to dive
(Tonight we dance like no-one sees)
