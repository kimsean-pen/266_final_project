You and I, we're all or nothing
Climb so high, we're gonna jump in
Darkening skies, we hear the thunder
You and I, surrender

We make the same mistakes
Ride this wave until it breaks
Tell me honey when we're gonna graduate
Tell me honey when we're gonna graduate
Night drives and wrong turns
Say you'll love me till it hurts
Tell me honey when we're gonna graduate
Tell me honey when we're gonna graduate

Bloodshot eyes, under the bleachers
Wasting time, into the future
You and I, surrender

We make the same mistakes
Ride this wave until it breaks
Tell me honey when we're gonna graduate
Tell me honey when we're gonna graduate
Night drives and wrong turns
Say you'll love me till it hurts
Tell me honey when we're gonna graduate
Tell me honey when we're gonna graduate

Around we go, to parking lots familiar roads
I know you know, the time has come to let it go
Around we go, dreaming that we'll leave this town
And if we don't, we'll both go down together

We make the same mistakes
Ride this wave until it breaks
Tell me honey when we're gonna graduate
Tell me honey when we're gonna graduate
Night drives and wrong turns
Say you'll love me till it hurts
Tell me honey when we're gonna graduate
Tell me honey when we're gonna graduate
