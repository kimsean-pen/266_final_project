With all my heart I always believed in you
And as you see up to now I was right
You made your way into the brightest light
Fighting the evil in the darkest nights

Walking towards the sun
Getting closer to the light
Now the pain is gone and it's gonna be alright
Walking towards the sun

Life forces us to make lots of decisions
And sometimes we really do not know
If we are wrong or if we do the right thing
Sometimes we'll fade and some other time we'll glow

Walking towards the sun
Getting closer to the light
Now the pain is gone and it's gonna be alright
Walking towards the sun

Walking towards the sun
Getting closer to the light
Now the pain is gone and it's gonna be alright
Walking towards the sun
