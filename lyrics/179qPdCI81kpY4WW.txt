Red lips, sidestep
Back in my room
And I know we ain't done yet
Place bets
How long we cruise [?]
But we do it so casually
So there are no casualties
But I know that we're actually
Finding out what the future brings
You plus me

Talk less, don't rush
I'll hold it tight
Talk before you say too much, push [?]
Can't see the light
Am I making hard to breathe?
At the point that you need release
Take [?] against the fucking leash
Want to feel them all over me

These walls can keep a secret
So don't talk [?] to chase your feelings
Whatever happens stays here
Unless your heart screams out what it wants
But if you don't
These walls can keep a secret

No clothes, no smoke
See through the glass
Lick your lips with that [?] so close
Do you like that?
I know you do, I know you do
Just tell the truth

These walls can keep a secret
So don't talk to chase your feelings
Whatever happens stays here
Unless your heart screams out what it wants
But if you don't
Tonight is where we leave it
These walls can keep a secret
I got what you needing
Whatever happens stays here
Unless you finally say what you want
But if you don't
These walls can keep a secret

I'm here, not scared
Someway [?]
Hold onto me, hold onto me now
You're safe
Reach out and take what's meant to be, what's meant to be now

These walls can keep a secret
So don't talk to chase your feelings
Whatever happens stays here
Unless your heart screams out what it wants
Tonight is where we leave it
These walls can keep a secret
I got what you needing
Whatever happens stays here
Unless you finally say what you want
But if you don't
These walls can keep a secret
