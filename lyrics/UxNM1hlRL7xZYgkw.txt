Jesus Christ I'm coming, terrestrial home
I'm allowed to guide their train
To visit you in Rome
I am sick of preachers telling to be plain
While you got it nice in here
They'd better feel ashamed

Oh, ways of gold lead is into your blaze of fame
Oh, are you waiting
For what we have brought you from hell?

Glory of Rome, glorious home
Praising the king of the kings
Glory of Rome, glorious home
Reaching for haloes and wings

Heading for the angels, heading for the feast
Heading for salvation and the ruin of the beast
Let us fight the outcast, let us brin 'em fire
Let us lock the center of their wicked, mad desire

Oh, ways of gold lead us into your blaze of fame
Oh, are you waiting
For what we have brought you from hell?

Glory of Rome, glorious home
Praising the king of the kings
Glory of Rome, glorious home
Reaching for haloes and wings

Holding in my hand, seven parts of a seal
To unlock the land of illumination I feel
And it's been foretold, after touching the light
We shall lock the world
But now it's our time to transcend
The ultimate key in our hand

Glory of Rome, glorious home
Praising the king of the kings
Glory of Rome, glorious home
Reaching for haloes and wings

Glory of Rome, glorious home
Praising the king of the kings
Glory of Rome, glorious home
Reaching for haloes and wings

Glory of Rome, glorious home
Praising the king of the kings
Glory of Rome, glorious home
