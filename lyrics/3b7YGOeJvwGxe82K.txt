I've been feeling like it's impossible to say it all
And I'm losing all control
'Cause I wish that I could break the fall and save it all
But I've been holding it too close

Wish I knew what you're thinking
Words don't come that easy
We might be broken by design

I can't help how I'm feeling
Scared of my own reasons
I don't wanna waste your time

Searching for another way
Another way, another way
To keep her safe another day
Another day, another day
It's easier to runaway
Runaway, runaway
Than to know what to say
Say, say
Than to know what to say

I just lie awake and play it out in my head
Like I know what to do
But the world has got a different plan for me and you
And it hurts when it's true

I don't know what you're thinking
Words don't come that easy
We might be broken by design

I can't help how I'm feeling
Scared of my own reasons
I don't wanna waste your time

Searching for another way
Another way, another way
To keep her safe another day
Another day, another day
It's easier to runaway
Runaway, runaway
Than to know what to say
Say, say
Than to know what to say

(Say, say, say)
(Say, say, say)

Searching for another way
Another way, another way
To keep her safe another day
Another day, another day
It's easier to runaway
Runaway, runaway
Than to know what to say
Say, say
Than to know what to say
Say, say
To know what to say
Say, say
