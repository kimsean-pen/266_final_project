Propel this solitary man in front of us
With his corrupted global agenda muttering into his ears

Corporate money stuffed into his pockets
To spread his darkened gospel
In the past the crowned once held the covenant
To shape and develop a better world

Their influence and supremacy
Built by generating optimistic and confident perception
Offerings to their herds of sheep

Time repeats itself and outspoken
Pledges continue to not succeed
The people have renounced trust in ideologies

Safety and protection is the contemporary vow
For the role that will reinstall masterdom and control

Corporate money stuffed into his pockets
To spread his darkened gospel

In the past the crowned once held the covenant
To shape and develop a better world

To rescue us from uncertainty and peril
That we are visionless to see or interpret
A threat that evidently needs to be fought
In a manufactured waged war

A vile misconception that has unfurled unquestioned
While being exaggerated and disfigured and disfigured

Their influence and supremacy built
By generating optimistic and confident perception
Offerings to their herds of sheep

A threat that evidently needs to be fought
In a manufactured waged war
A vile misconception that has unfurled
Unquestioned while being exaggerated and disfigured
