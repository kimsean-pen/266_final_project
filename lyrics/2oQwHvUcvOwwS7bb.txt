You think you know me
I wish I did too
'cause everything's changing
And I am changing too

It's not a question
This shit is real
And it's hard to look back
But it's harder to move on
Funny, it's a good time
For a timeless song

I gave you my heart
Gave you my soul
Yeah, but baby, I was born to rock and now I gotta roll
I'm moving on, yeah I gotta let go
Yeah, 'cause baby, I was born to rock and now I gotta roll

No one pretends the way I do
It's so hard to hear the truth
You've got your reasons, so do I
I like to dream, 'cause dreams don't lie

I'll play along, like nothing's wrong
Baby I love you, But the moon is blue

Do you remember, we were young?
Imagination filled our lungs
Wolf, don't make a helpless move
You see me and I see you

So play along, like nothing's wrong
Baby I love you, But the moon is blue

Let's play along
Oh, until I'm gone
Is it in my head?
Sometimes I wish that i was
