I know there's got be
More in love than smoking weed
Getting off and getting by
You are the rhythm to my rhyme

You are my radio
Turn you up when I feel low
You are the soundtrack to all I know
You are the rock to my roll

My roll, my roll, my roll
You are the rock to my roll, my roll, my roll
You are the rock to my roll

Roll my heart high up my sleeve
I'll let you roll it up for me
Who needs money when, love is gold

You are the rock to my roll, my roll, my roll
You are the rock to my roll, my roll, my roll

So now we are singing
It keeps our hearts beating
Skeletons dancing, our bones are romancing
Tonight, tonight we come on life at night

You are the rock to my roll, my roll, my roll
You are the rock to my roll, my roll, my roll
You are the anchor to my soul
My soul, my soul, my soul
You are the rock to my roll, my roll, my roll
You are the rock to my rol
