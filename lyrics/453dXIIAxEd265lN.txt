Sleepy time tea, vote me closer to bigger than Texas times three
I lose the coupons for groceries
And it would suck (to be) completely equal
What stops your bitch from believing people?
Count your fingers, concretely provide
A double TV to leak you're alive
Propose a loaf timber reflexing gold
As long as I look good when I'm old

Fa√ßade of fascist, bravado elliptical
The smell of colin in black boxers, mystic mole
Get those electric blue foot things from Dr. Scholls
You need stillocs just to be me

Feel free to let it out give it all up

Accept your face is so upset old
Bitching same ol, don't make me cold
Rape the bank for your bail out gold
Licking tricks are for 10 year olds
Missing lips are like lip tip Bledsoe
You can bounce on me, I just said so
We can fry it, don't shit my bed though
It's a fallacy, I like meatloaf

I'm so fed, so fed, I'm green
I'm so fed, so fed, I'm green
I'm so fed, so fed, I'm green
I gave my liver to the football team

I don't do no, do no, do no sluts
I don't do no, do no, do no sluts
I don't do no, do no, do no sluts
I got acid that I gargle for a fresh brain stump

Sock full of wood I'm painting flesh tones
I thought you drank my locket full of glue
Don't wanna sit cross legged in a circle
I won't wear, shirts that are pink or purple?
I thought you knew, my locket full of glue
Was really coke, coke I bought from Urkel
I thought you drank my locket full of glue
Once again I don't wear pink or purple

Resounding yes as my eyes leak out an eagles skull
Bludgeoning a mitten, meticulous self-control
I need these priests to stop molesting your kids backdoor
It's fucking disgusting man

The wrong religion well you have selected
Nuclear launch detected
