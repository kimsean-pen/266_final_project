I've been in love but now I'm waiting
Don't ever want to worry about a thing
Well I sit at home and I wonder
Will I rise or will I go under?

Let it be me, if you're lonely
Let it be me, your one and only
Let it be me, to satisfy you
Let it be me, if you're feelin', feelin' blue

Well I've seen you around but you don't know me
I've watched your life but can't always see you
Well I'll try and I'll try girl to love you
And when we die you will have loved too

Let it be me, if you're lonely
Let it be me, your one and only
Let it be me, to satisfy you
Let it be me, if you're feelin', feelin' blue, yeah

Well you know your friends talk bad about me
Your folks say it's not supposed to be
Well you know girl your life's going by fast
Try to make it last

Let it be me, if you're lonely
Let it be me, your one and only
Let it be me, to satisfy you
Let it be me, if you're feelin', feelin' blue, feelin' blue

Let it be me
Let it be me
Let it be me
