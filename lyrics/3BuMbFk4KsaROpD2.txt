Don't play pop music
You know I hate pop music
Just sing the means in godless grace
So, don' wear bright colors
Oh you know I hate bright colors
I never like you for the way you dress anyway

Goodbye, lovers and friends
It's so sad to leave you
When they lie and say this is not the end
You can laugh as if we are still together
You can laugh about it all anyway

Hope you didn't bring flowers
Hope you didn't write a poem
Hope you remember every fight
Know I can be obnoxious
Occasionally cruel
But only to the ones I love

Goodbye, lovers and friends
It's so sad to leave you
When they lie and say this is not the end
You can laugh as if we are still together
You can laugh about it all

Don't get inventory
and don't fake your memory
And don't get me virtues that I never had
Don't get sychophantal
We never were sentimental
I know I took more than I ever gave

Don't need to be forgiven
Not now that I've been living
That's the only thing I ask
So don't play any pop music
You know I hate pop music
Just sing the means in godless grace

Goodbye, lovers and friends
It's so sad to leave you
When they lie and say this is not the end
You can laugh as if we are still together
But this really is the end
