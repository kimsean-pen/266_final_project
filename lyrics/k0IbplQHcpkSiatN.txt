Unknown, talk to unknown
Ever, lasts forever
Well, it's a sharp shock
to your soft side
Summer moon
Catch your shut eye
In your room, in my room
In your room, in my room

Louder, lips speak louder
Better back together
Still it's a sharp shock
to your soft side
Summer moon
Catch your shut eye
In my room, in your room
In my room, in your room

It's the time, it's the day; gonna leave me
It's the time, it's the place; gonna leave me
It's the time, it's the day; gonna leave me
It's the time, it's the place; gonna leave me out
Leave me out, leave me out, leave me out

Leave
Leave
Leave
Ah, ah
Leave
