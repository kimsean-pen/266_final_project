You stole my pure intentions
You are the sickness in between
Let me in, I'll bury the pain

You taught me to be sad as you
You almost made me take it all
Let me in, I'll bury the pain

You bend me and you shake me
You make me then you break me
Let me in, I'll bury the pain

You made me feel like a sinner
Now you fear you'll die alone
Let me in, I'll bury the pain

The sickness that you are
A plague that made me starve
Do you think you can show me
How I've come this far

The sickness that you are
A plague that made me starve
Do you think you can show me
How I've come this far

I feel it's taking over
Everything falls dark
Break me open, the desperate cry

The sickness that you are
A plague that made me starve
Do you think you can show me
How I've come this far

The sickness that you are
A plague that made me starve
Do you think you can show me
How I've come this far
