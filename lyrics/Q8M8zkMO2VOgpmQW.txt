It ain't easy sometimes
Tryin' just keeping
When you get broken down again
It ain't because you didn't try

I tried to count days
Then I've been disappointed
So many low times
It gives you taunting

But it's hard tryin' make a living
When you get up again
And you you just keep giving hey

*chorus*
Every time I get up (I get up)
Something's coming and bring me down
I get so low sometimes
Feel like love beats you down yeah

I tried my best to make my way
But it wasn't enough (it wasn't enough)
Desire burns when your dreams are all too turn

I am looking for a land
To leave this dark
But the hardest part is
Staring from the start

But it's hard
Tryin' make a living oh yeah
And get up again
And I'm just keep giving
Giving' away
Everything
Givin' away
Everything
Givin' away
Everything yeah

*chorus* 2x

I get so low
I get so low yeah
But it's hard
Yes it's hard
I tryin' just get by
Tryin' make a living
Yeah yeah
I tryin' just get by
Just get by
Just get by
Jest get by
Yes it's hard
Oh yeah
Baby no
Every night
Everyday
I tryin' just
Just get by
Yeah
