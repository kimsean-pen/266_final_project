I can think of younger days
When living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
I was never told about the sorrow

And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain falling down?
Tell me how can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go 'round?

How can you mend this broken man? Yeah
How can a loser ever win?
Somebody please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
La la la la la

I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
But we could never see tomorrow
It would be that no one, no one ever told us about the sorrow

So how can you mend a broken heart? And mine is
How can you stop the rain falling down? (How can you stop)
How can you stop this right ol' sun from shining? (The sun from shining)
What makes the world go 'round?

And sometimes after saying, say
La, la, la, la, la, la, yeah, la, la, la, la...
(Help me) Help me mend my, my broken heart
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna live again, baby

How can you mend this broken man?
Somebody tell me, and how can a loser ever win?
Baby, help me mend this old broken heart
I think I, I know I, I believe I, I feel like I gotta
I feel like I'm going to live again

How can you mend this broken heart?
Somebody please tell me!
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
Although my clothes are all wet, tell me
How can you mend my, please help me mend my broken heart
I think I, I believe I, I got a feeling that I want to live and live and live
