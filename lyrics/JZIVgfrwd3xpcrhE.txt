Mmmm.
When you told me that I was a star in the sky
Baby I believed every word.
And you seemed so sincere
It was perfectly clear
'Cause forever was all that I heard.
And every little kiss
From your tender lips
Couldn't have been a lie
I fell hard over head
Without a safety net
I don't understand this goodbye

Was I the only one who fell in love?
There never really was the two of us
Maybe my all just wasn't good enough
Was I the only one, only one, in love?

As I walk down the hall
See the place on the wall
Where the picture of us used to be.
I fight back those tears, cause
I still feel you here.
How could you walk out so easily?
And I don't understand, how I
Can feel this pain, and still be alive.
And all these broken dreams

And all these memories
Are killing me inside.
Was I the only one who fell in love?
There never really was the two of us
Maybe my all just wasn't good enough
Was I the only one, only one
Tell me, what I'm supposed to

Do with all this love?
Baby, it was supposed to be the two of us.
Help me, cause I still don't want to believe.
I was the only one.
I was the only one.
I was the only one who fell in love.
There never really was the two of us (hey)
Maybe my all just wasn't good enough.
I was the only one, the only one.
I was the only one who fell in love.

There never really was the two of us.
Maybe my all just wasn't good enough.
Was I the only one, the only one, in love?
When you told me that I was a star in the sky
Baby I believed every word.
