One boy, one girl, two hearts, their world
Time goes by, secrets rise
One more sad song, tears shed, she's gone
She'd take it back if she only could

And all the perfect words they seem so wrong
She's gone
You wish that you could learn to see
The door is closed and you wish you could be
Alone with you, alone with me
What can I do? I cannot breathe
My heart is torn for all to see
Alone with you, alone with me

Best friend, worst thing, she's been cheating
Friend deceives, she leaves
Last date she cries, whispers goodbye
She walks once more out that door

And all the perfect words they seem so wrong
She's gone
You wish that you could learn to see
The door is closed and you wish you could be
Alone with you, alone with me
What can I do? I cannot breathe
My heart is torn for all to see
Alone with you, alone with me

Please
(Please)
(Please)
Please, please stay, don't go away
The hardest thing is letting go of you
Stay, don't go away
The hardest thing is letting go of you
What can I do?

Alone with you
Alone with me
What can I do? I cannot breathe
Alone with
Alone with
Alone with you
Alone with me
What can I do? I cannot breathe
My heart is torn for all to see
Alone with you
Alone with
