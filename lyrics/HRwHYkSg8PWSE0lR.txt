Set your clock back, looking at the map
Wondering where you'd be at
'Cause it's so bad when you're not around
You're never around
It used to be you and me, holding hands, smoldering
Kicking up leaves, talking 'bout getting older
But now you're not around

There'll never be a rhyme or reason
For when it rolls around to this season
When all the leaves start their turning
And you start to burn again in my brain

I'm falling for you, I'm falling
I can't forget you, now it's cold and
All of the leaves on all of the trees
Are falling with me down to the ground and
I'm falling for you

You're like a good book
Snuggled up on the sofa when it's raining outside
But I'm warm, 'cause I feel you around
But you're so outta town
I kinda wanna call
But I bet that you're busy with that fancy new job
And the fall won't affect you
Like how it makes me feel now

October's so overwhelming
And all of my friends, they tell me
November, it should get better
But I still see you all over the place

I'm falling for you, I'm falling
I can't forget you, now it's cold and
All of the leaves on all of the trees
Are falling with me down to the ground and
I'm falling, I'm falling

Oh, you are like sunshine
With a chance of rain, I
Love the cool crisp air, and
I don't care if you're near
'Cause I feel you like you're here
You're everywhere

I'm falling for you, I'm falling
I can't forget you, now it's cold and
All of the leaves on all of the trees
Are falling with me down to the ground and
I'm falling, I'm falling
I'm falling for you
