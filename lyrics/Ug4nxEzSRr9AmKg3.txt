Ah, sometimes we just, sometimes we just
Sometimes we just fk things up
Ah, sometimes we just fk things up
Hmm, sometimes we just fk things up
Ah, sometimes we just fk things up
I know sometimes ain't the best to get around
Sometimes when shit get fked up and I mess around
I guess it's just the way the world is tryin' to bullshit now
A tree get fallen down, just sat down
Sometimes we just fk things up
Sometimes we just fk things up
Just fk thing up
I [?] get frown [?]
I say funny things [?] you off
It's why I wake you in the middle of the night
Sometimes we just fk things up
Ah, sometimes we just fk things up
Ah, sometimes we just fk things up
Sometimes we just fk things up
Just fk things up
Ah, sometime, for sometime
We just fk things up
