White on white translucent black capes
Back on the back

Bela Lugosi's dead

The bats have left the bell tower
The victims have been bled
Red velvet lines the black box

Bela Lugosi's dead

Bela Lugosi's dead

Undead, undead, undead
Undead, undead, undead

The virginal brides file past his tomb
Strewn with time's dead flowers bereft in deathly bloom
Alone in a darkened room, the Count

Bela Lugosi's dead
Bela Lugosi's dead
Bela Lugosi's dead

Undead, undead, undead
Undead, undead, undead
Undead

Oh Bela
Bela's undead
Oh Bela
Bela's undead

Bela's undead
Oh Bela
Bela's undead
Oh Bela

Undead
