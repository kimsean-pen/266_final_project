All the things you havent seen
everything that last between
pages you've yet to turn

Lessons you've never learn
all the things you shoud have say
Will forever be in your hear
Just waiting for a reason
waiting for a real thing

But I got time and you've got time
remember when stars and I
and everything we did we did together

But I don't mind if you don't mind
and even if it all falls dawn
it's just another chance to make it better

I'm ready
I'm waiting
I'm waiting for what will come

'Cause it s you I like
so don't be shy
Just walk and up
before you die
but here we go again
you say you're not my friend
and I'll be standing
we'll forget the thing we had
we'll blame it on the season
never on the reason

But I got time and you've got time
remember when stars and I
and everything we did we did together

But I don't mind if you don't mind
and even if it all falls dawn
it's just another chance to make it better

You know our love is gonna lost
so listen to your heart
when everyone around
is like we're standing in the dark
you know our love is gonna change
as soon as you check out
stoping you're rage
before the father pledge you stay

I'm ready
I'm waiting
I'm waiting for what will come

I'm ready
I'm waiting
I'm waiting for what will come
What will come
