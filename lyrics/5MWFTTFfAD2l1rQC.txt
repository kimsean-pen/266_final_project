Why I make that face? Oh why would I?
Why would I test my faith? Oh why would I?
Oh well
I see that raincloud coming right for me

Why would I say my name? Oh why would I?
When I'm so far away? Oh why would I?
Oh well
I guess I've always been a bit of a fighter

From now on wear my love for you loose
From now on I am just passing through
From now on trust my feeling is true
From now on call me Royal Blue

Oh
Why would I stick around? Oh why would I?
Why would I get burned out? Oh why would I?
Oh woah
For me I'm always waiting in shadows
Oh woah
For me I'm always looking for a way out

From now on with the sky as my roof
From now on let the risk lead me to
From now on somewhere I never knew
From now on call me Royal Blue

Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

From now on fly as high as I want
From now on I'll show my weak spot
From now on you know that I do
From now on call me Royal Blue

From now on wear my love for you loose
From now on I am just passing through
From now on trust my feeling is true
From now on call me Royal Blue
