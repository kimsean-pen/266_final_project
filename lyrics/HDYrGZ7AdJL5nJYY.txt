Everything I know will change, I'll never be the same
So I'm told as a voice repeats "Again, again and again"
What if it doesn't feel like everyone said it should?
What have I become?
How'd I fall so far, now no one can find me
Realise in a moment my ambition is a curse
'Cause it hides all the best in me, but shows the worst
How'd I fall so far, now no one can find me
How'd I fall so far, now no one can find me
There's nothing behind me, to take me back to the start
Can someone remind me, of who that I used to be?

I can't seem to wake up from this dream
I can't catch my breath enough to scream
Be careful what you wish for
'Cause your wishes may not be what they seem
How'd I fall so far now no one can find me
How'd I fall so far now no one can find me
There's nothing behind me
To take me back to start
Can someone rewind me, to who that I used to be?
To who that I used to be
(What if it doesn't feel like everyone said it should)
What have I become?
