Pays no attention to me
Makes me believe that I'm free
Am I with nothing at all
Am I with nothing at all
You would be so different

If you could hear what he says
How little he even cares
Like he knows nothing at all
He knows nothing at all
Life can be so distant

I swear he brings it on himself
He's the reason that you make me melt
I'm done with this fighting
I need to break it down

Everytime I dance
And I look into his eyes
I'm daring him to ask me
He might aswell be blind
I take it as a given
Like I could never go
I could just tell him
I wan't him to know

This side of the moon
I'm with you
This side of the moon
I'm with you

What do you feel for me
Is it nothing but pity
That's not what I need
That is not what I need
You know what I'm saying

It doesn't have to be hard
We don't have to be far
I'm running to you
I am depending on you
Will he be there waiting

And I swear he brings it on himself
He's the reason that you make me melt
I'm done with this fighting
I need to break it down

Everytime I dance
And I look into his eyes
I'm daring him to ask me
He might aswell be blind
I take it as a given
Like I could never go
I could just tell him
I wan't him to know

This side of the moon
I'm with you
This side of the moon
I'm with you

This side of the moon
I'm with you
This side of the moon
I'm with you
This side of the moon (Everytime we're dancing)
I'm with you (Everyting we're dancing)
This side of the moon (Everytime we're dancing)
I'm with you (Tell him I want him to know)
This side of the moon
I'm with you (Tell him I want him to know)
This side of the moon
I'm with you (Tell him I want him to know)
This side of the moon
I'm with you (Tell him I want him to go)
