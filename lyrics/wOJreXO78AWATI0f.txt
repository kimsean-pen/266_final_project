Girl you feel like china white
Make every nerve and fiber rise
The way you rush inside my mind
Surprised I got this high tonight
But I'm fine to drive to a time you like
Since laws by space and time defined
Apply to all, but trust me doll, not you and I

Baby from 9 to 5 a.m. our stars align
Rock on from side to side
Round and round like fireflies
She wants it all the time
Wet dreams and lullabies
I give it my all tonight
The way I have her calling like

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby from 9 to 5 a.m. our stars align
Rock on from side to side
Round and round like fireflies
She wants it all the time
Wet dreams and lullabies
I give it my all tonight
The way I have her calling like

When you flap your wings that close to me
I'll chase that wind like you won't believe
What exactly dear, are we supposed to be
If not the king and queen of our dopamine
Like therapy, mentally
But more than that, it's meant to be
Physically, when I beat that thing like a tambourine
It's like alchemy, my recipe
To set you free from the pest that is your dress you see
Less is more and flesh are we
Why else would I give you the best of me?
And if you never leave and stretch out the now
I'll wrap all in towels
Let's drench our whole house
In sweat from our brows

Baby from 9 to 5 a.m. our stars align
Rock on from side to side
Round and round like fireflies
She wants it all the time
Wet dreams and lullabies
I give it my all tonight
The way I have her calling like

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby from 9 to 5 a.m. our stars align
Rock on from side to side
Round and round like fireflies
She wants it all the time
Wet dreams and lullabies
I give it my all tonight
The way I have her calling like

Calling, calling, calling, calling
Calling, calling, calling, calling
Calling, calling, calling, calling
The way I have her calling like

Calling, calling, calling, calling
Calling, calling, calling, calling
Calling, calling, calling, calling
The way I have her calling like
