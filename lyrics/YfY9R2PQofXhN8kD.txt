Crave the blood flow
To feed your ego
You rip from my flesh
To fill you hollow
You amputated
Manipulated
I'm out of my mind
Decapitated
Before your maggots
Decompose you
Allow me to diagnose you

Terminal narcissistic
Your prognosis
666
Medication
Won't fix your sick
What you need is an exorcist

Eat me alive
Superior mind
You poison the rats
Inferior kind
Sever the soul
For complete control
To fill up your heart
Your black hole

Before your maggots decompose you
Allow me to diagnose you

Terminal narcissistic
Your prognosis
666

Medication
Won't fix your sick
What you need is an exorcist

Get it through your mind
The only way is a lobotomy
Drilling through the swine
Disect your infected
Anatomy

Go

It's not a case of pure psychosis
Listen to your
Diagnosis
Terminal narcissistic
Your prognosis

666
Medication
Won't fix your sick
What you need is an
Exorcist
Oh
No
Medication
Won't fix your sick
666
What you need is an
Exorcist
