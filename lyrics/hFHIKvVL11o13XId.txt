Sometimes I'm happy and sometimes I'm blue;
My only wish is depending on you.
Although you are so very far,
Please, help me, help me, Little Star.

There is something about her that I cannot explain,
And to be without her, it would drive me insane.
Little Star above, my wish is of
My only, my only, only love.

If she only knew the pain in my heart,
And what I went through since we've been apart.
Little Star aglow, if she should know
My only, my only, only love.
