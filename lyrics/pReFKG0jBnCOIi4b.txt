She's another victim of life, we've come to know
Technology, celebrity, all the things you cannot hold
She's from a long lost tribe looking for the light
Or a friend to hold her hand
She's doing the best she can

Seems that everyone we know's
Out there waiting by a phone
Wondering why they feel alone
In this life

Are we all just satellites?
Where's the love? Show me tonight
Here's the moment we unite
Ooh-ooh-oh ooh-ooh-oh-oh
For all we know life's just a dream
Who the hell knows what it means?
Stop the world and sing with me
Ooh-ooh-oh ooh-ooh-oh-oh

All her memories have been
Experienced through
High speed on a video screen
That's all she ever knew
Did you know none of it's real if you can't feel
The beating of someone's heart
Don't leave yourself in the dark

Seems that everyone we know's
Out there waiting by a phone
Wondering why they feel alone
In this life

Are we all just satellites?
Where's the love? Show me tonight
Here's the moment we unite
Ooh-ooh-oh ooh-ooh-oh-oh
For all we know life's just a dream
Who the hell knows what it means?
Stop the world and sing with me
Ooh-ooh-oh ooh-ooh-oh-oh

Are we satellites?
Are we satellites?

Are we all just satellites?
Where's the love? Show me tonight
Here's the moment we unite
Ooh-ooh-oh ooh-ooh-oh-oh
For all we know life's just a dream
Who the hell knows what it means?
Stop the world and sing with me
Ooh-ooh-oh ooh-ooh-oh-oh

Are we all just satellites?
Where's the love? Show me tonight
Here's the moment we unite
Ooh-ooh-oh ooh-ooh-oh-oh
For all we know life's just a dream
Who the hell knows what it means?
Stop the world and sing with me
Ooh-ooh-oh ooh-ooh-oh-oh
