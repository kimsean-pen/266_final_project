In the world that you would make up
With unicorns and buffalo backs
I know that you would wake up
With the sunny side touching your back

Is it the lonely man of Christmas?
Coming up with theories on him
Is it the lonely man of Christmas?
He's riding in the devil's abyss

Oh I would write the future
If I could put a finger on it
But I have no idea
If what I want is better than this

Is it the lonely man of Christmas?
He's hoping for a break in the plan
it the lonely drive to Denver?
The loneliness of holding your hand

Is it the time we spent in silence?
Time will tell what winter he had
Is it the lonely man of winter?
I could put my finger on that

And even if it's Christmas
Could we just pretend for a bit
That everything we went through
Was something so much better than this
