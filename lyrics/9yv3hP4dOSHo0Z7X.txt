Irridescent eyes of the seahorse rise
Treasure she loves
Others dispise
A shooting star shan't fall very far
Dim fireflies held in glass jars
April showers brings May flowers
Dazzling dust tossed in wind gusts
The trap door is open
The window half closed
The tapestry curtain vivaciously closed
London bridge did fall down
My fair lady nearly drowned
What is the reason to lock her up
When already she's had such rotten luck
Bracelets of silver adorn my wrists
Candy kisses from sugared lips
Candy kisses me
Kisses me
The London bridge did fall down
My fair lady nearly drowned
(My fair lady)
The London bridge did fall down
My fair lady nearly drowned
(My fair lady)
London bridge is falling down
Falling down
Falling down
London bridge is falling down
My fair lady
Take the key and lock her up
Lock her up
Lock her up
Take the key and lock her up
My fair lady
