Too many things go unsaid
'Cause you think you can't say them right
Get them out in the open
Instead of all bottled up inside

'Cause I don't mind
If it comes out all emotional
And I don't mind
As long as what you say is real

I know you're the kind of man
Who wants to show your best side
But we can't always be perfect
And that's alright

Don't over think it
You don't have to perform for me
You want to know how to touch me
Well, it's easy

Oh, it's like playing the piano
Oh, I don't care if there's a few wrong notes
You don't have to be a Mozart
If you just play it from the heart

Oh, oh, it's like playing the piano
Oh, your fingers know just where to go
And you don't have to be a Mozart
If you just play it from the heart, yeah, yeah

Ah, if you just play it from the heart, ooh

I know once something's been spoken aloud
It can't be taken back
But don't be too proud
Too proud to risk that

Between the tension
The major and the minor chords
There's a magic we're waiting for
We're waiting for

Oh, it's like playing the piano
I don't care if there's a few wrong notes
You don't have to be a Mozart
If you just play it from the heart

Oh, oh, it's like playing the piano
Oh, your fingers know just where to go
You don't have to be a Mozart
No, if you just play it from the heart

Oh, the way you're playing that piano
I got a Mozart of my own
The way you're running up and down those keys
Sounds like a symphony to me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Ooh, you wanna know how to touch me
Well, it's easy

Oh, it's like playing the piano
Oh, I don't care if there's a few wrong notes
Oh, you don't have to be a Mozart
If you just play it from the heart

Oh, oh, it's like playing the piano
Your fingers know just where to go
You don't have to be a Mozart
If you just play it from the heart

Oh, it's like playing the piano
Oh, I don't care if there's a few wrong notes
Oh, you don't have to be a Mozart
If you just play it from the heart

Oh, oh, it's like playing the piano
And your fingers know just where to go
You don't have to be a Mozart
If you just play it from the heart, yeah, yeah

And you just play it from the heart, yeah, yeah
You just play it from the heart, yeah, yeah
