I did my best, but there were still some parts I couldn't entirely understand. maybe

you will have a better time figuring it out.
you know I walk the streets of gold,
and I can't find my babies bones
it was two flukes of the nose?
that take me down to my lowest home
and you don't mind where I go
somewhere in my wings
I found my home
it's made of whithers? and pins
and I'm returning again

and my dreams are made of ghost skins
when I wake up in my dark places
and I reach for the messy faces
that take me down to my favorite ride
oh I am blossoming down
and I stay down here
when dreams cloud my mind
to take me away this time
you know I walk the streets of gold and I
can't find my babies bones
it was two flukes of the nose?
that take me down to my lowest home
and you don't mind where I go
somewhere in the wings
I found my home
it's made of whithers? and pins
and I'm returning again
oh I am blossoming down
and I stay down here
when dreams cloud my mind
to take me away this time
