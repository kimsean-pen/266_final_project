You're playing tricks, babe and that's a fact
Your magic circle ain't where it's at
One moment you were here and then you disappeared
This ain't the first time I've caught your act

Nothing up my sleeve, babe
Watch out, watch out
Magic's what you need, babe
Just like that, hey

You know your sleight of hand is messing up my life
Maybe this time, babe, you're gonna get it right
One moment you were there, now just an empty chair
This ain't the first time you've shot out my lights

Nothing up my sleeve, babe
Watch out, watch out
Magic's what you need, babe
Just like that, ow

Saw me in half, babe, that's quite a trick
You make me laugh, babe, you make me sick
I'm gone, but now you lack the spell to bring me back
This ain't the first time I've seen your magic slip

Nothing up my sleeve, babe
Watch out, watch out
Magic's what you need, babe
Just like that, hey

Watch out
