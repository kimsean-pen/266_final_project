I don't have to mention that I saw you today
I shone the sun into your eyes
You don't always have to question why there's pleasure and pain
Because there's no truth for you to find

I'm drawing perfect circles around the life that we could share
What is ours is ours to keep
I know the thing you want the most, you hide it over there
Safe at the dark end of the street

When the devil's waiting
Down by the river calling out
I want to be the one to light up the dark in you
And when the flood is over
And all the love is pouring out
I want to be the one to light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you

There's so little I'm afraid of when it comes to an end
But I can't leave you on your own
When your chaos turns to silence, and your enemy's your friend
I will roll away the stone

When the devil's waiting
Down by the river calling out
I want to be the one to light up the dark in you
And when the flood is over
And all the love is pouring out
I want to be the one to light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you

Light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you

Oooh

When the devil's waiting
Down by the river calling out
I want to be the one to light up the dark in you
And when the flood is over
And all the love is pouring out
I want to be the one to light up the dark in you
When the devil's waiting
Down by the river calling out
I want to be the one to light up the dark in you
And when the flood is over
And all the love is pouring out
I want to be the one to light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
Light up the dark in you
