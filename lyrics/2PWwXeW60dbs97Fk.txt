Well, every road I see
Leads away from me
There's not a single one
That leads me home
The road keeps saying
Friend, come see what's round the bend
So is it any wonder that I roam?

All the places I have been
Keep calling me back again
Down in the pines
I hear the cold winds blow
My heart keeps telling me
Footloose and fancy-free
And the road goes by
And calls me as it goes

Well, maybe somewhere there's a someone
Waiting there with a smile
And maybe there'll be a place
To stop and rest awhile
And maybe you weren't meant to be
Just a rolling stone
And there's a road to travel on
That leads you back to home

Oh, but I'll keep travelling on
Keep looking at the dawn
Till I can lay this lonesome body down
And when that day has come
I nevermore will roam
And every road I see will lead me home
