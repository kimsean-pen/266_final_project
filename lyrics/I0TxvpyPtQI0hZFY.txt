Save me
Save me
Save me

I've gotta stop my mind
Working overtime
It's driving me insane
It will not let me live
Always so negative
It's become my enemy

Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me

Why would I think such things
Crazy thoughts have quick wings
Gaining momentum fast
One minute I am fine
The next I've lost my mind
To a fake fantasy

And none of these thoughts are real
So why is it that I feel
So cut up and so bad
I need to take control
'Cause my mind is on a roll
And it isn't listening to me

Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me

Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the dumbest of them all
Insecurities keep growing
Wasted energies are flowing
Anger, pain and sadness beckon
Panic sets in in a second
Be aware it's just your mind
And you can stop it anytime

Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me

OK so here we go
If it works I'll let you know
One two three I say stop
