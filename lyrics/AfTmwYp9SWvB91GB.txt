Maria -she's too young to understand, but old enough to fell the pain
Of living where no love can grow with no hope for change
Maria - her world is an angry place but she makes sure that scars don't show
And with every hurt her tender heart is growing cold (but)
CHORUS
Who, who's gonna love Maria
Who, who's gonna touch her with the tenderness she longs for
Like a desert longs for rain
She's got a hunger deep inside and with every tear she cries
She wonders if there's someone out there somewhere
Who's gonna love Maria
(Maria) she looks in the mirror now and the little girl is gone
But still the search for someone's love goes on and on for Maria
But does anybody care or even notice her at all
Is anyone listening close enough to hear her call (and who)
CHORUS
Who, who's gonna love Maria
Who, who's gonna touch her with the tenderness she longs for
Like a desert longs for rain
She's got a hunger deep inside and with every tear she cries
She wonders if there's someone out there
BRIDGE
Maria if you can hear me, please know that you're not forgotten
Somebody's trying to get to you
(Chorus 1)
