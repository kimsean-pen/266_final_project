You think you know me

Soft as shit, bitch!
Wet... wet!
Wet! Wet! Wet! Wet!
Wet! Wet! Wet! Wet!

Wet, wet, wet
Kill the connect
Repo man when I come to collect
Beat 'em like Rhythm Roulette
You niggas scared of the god
Bitch, keep that shit on the net
I treat your (???) like Rafiki
I raise the K like a kid
AR built like Lena Dunham
When I shoot, I don't miss (Trapaholics!)
Crackers be singing like chorus
Choppa be changing they pitch
Choppa pay a nigga a rent
Choppa write a nigga hits
Heard he wanna be a rapper
Choppa change a nigga niche
Niggas always wanna get buck 'till they meet 50 Cent
Fuck a subtweet, Sub-Pop niggas heads off like pez
Alt-right want war, well that's fine then
Bitch niggas in the way, well that's common
White boys getting mad cause of my content
Y'all brave on the web, keep it in the comments
Sock it to a nigga like mankind
And motherfuck that flag nigga, we dying
CAC!
Bitch!
Pussy!

Where my ladies at?
I love y'all
The real is back!

I'm a real nigga (Whoa!)
I'm a real nigga (Whoa!)
I'm a real nigga (Whoa!)
I'm a real nigga (Whoa!)
