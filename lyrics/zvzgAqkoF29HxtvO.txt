Trapped in a prison, in a prism of light
Alone in the darkness, darkness of white
We fell in love, alone on a stage
In the reflective age

Entre la nuit, la nuit et l'aurore
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven
I don't know what it's for
If I can't find you there
I don't care

I thought I found a way to enter
It's just a Reflektor, it's just a Reflektor
I thought I found the connector
It's just a Reflektor, it's just a Reflektor

Signals we send, are deflected again
We're still connected, but are we even friends?
We fell in love when I was nineteen
And now we're staring at a screen

Entre la nuit, la nuit et l'aurore
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven
I need something more
Just a place to be alone
'Cause you're my home

I thought I found a way to enter
It's just a Reflektor, it's just a Reflektor
I thought I found the connector
It's just a Reflektor, it's just a Reflektor

It's just a Reflektor, it's just a Reflektor
It's just a Reflektor, it's just a Reflektor

Our song it skips, on little silver discs
Our love is plastic, we'll break it to bits
I want to break free, but will they break me
Down, down, down?
Don't mess around

I thought I found a way to enter
It's just a Reflektor, it's just a Reflektor
I thought I found the connector
It's just a Reflektor, it's just a Reflektor

It's just a Reflektor, it's just a Reflektor
It's just a Reflektor, it's just a Reflektor

Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor
It's just a Reflektor, it's just a Reflektor
Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor
It's just a Reflektor, it's just a Reflektor

Just a Reflektor
Just a Reflektor
Just a Reflektor
Just a Reflektor
But I see you on the other side
It's just a Reflektor
But I see you on the other side
We all got things to hide
It's just a Reflektor
