Oh, night I left the city, dreamt of wolf

He came from where the winds are cold
And truth is seen through keyholes
Strange longings that'll never sleep
And now he's come where no heart beats

Cry wolf, time to worry
Cry wolf, time to worry now

You can start but you cannot stop
You give in but you can't give up
You can tell all your desperate jokes
To a world that puts your love on hold

Cry wolf, time to worry
Cry wolf, time to worry now
Cry wolf, time to worry
Cry wolf, time to worry now

The sunken-in eyes
And the pain in his cries
A shape in the dark

Cry wolf, time to worry
Cry wolf, time to worry now
Cry wolf, time to worry now
Cry wolf, time to worry now
Cry wolf, time to worry
Cry wolf, time to worry now
Cry wolf, time to worry now
Cry wolf, time to worry now
