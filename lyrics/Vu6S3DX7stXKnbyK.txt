Wake up, can you hear me?
You're so clever, did you find me?
In the backroom, in your closet
In your suitcase, there's no running

I will find you, like the glacier
In the seabed, leaving Canyons,
In your cheekbones, passing through you
In the shadows, scenes undo you

Cut your ribbon, as it follows you
Everything, everything
How can you sleep at night?
And it falls apart
Anything, anything
How can you sleep at night?

Face it, can you hear it?
Violation, you'll remember
It's all harmless, incidential
Disengaging these thoughts break you

Concious vicious, it has found you
Monovision, synapse fails you
Frequent syndrome, stings and burns through
Monovision then dilutes you

Cut your ribbon, as it follows you
Everything, everything
How can you sleep at night?
And it falls apart
Anything, anything
How can you sleep at night?

As it follows you
Everything, everything
How can you sleep at night?
And it falls apart
Anything, anything
How can you sleep at night?

Can you escape these motives?
Can you escape these motives?
Can you escape these motives?

Cut your ribbon, as it follows you
Everything, everything
How can you sleep at night?
As it falls apart
Anything, anything
How can you sleep at night?
