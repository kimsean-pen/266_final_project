Well, I rocked over Italy and I rocked over Spain
I rocked in Memphis it was all the same
Till I rocked to Africa and rolled off ship.
And seen them natives doing an odd looking skip
I parted the weeds and looked over the swamp
I seen them cats doing the Ubangi Stomp Ubangi stomp with rock and roll
Beats anything that's ever been told
Ubangi stomp Ubangi style
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild Well, I looked up the chief and he invited me in
Said a heap big jam session 'bout to begin
He handed me a tom-tom I picked up the beat
That crazy thing sent shivers to my feet
Rocked and rolled and I skipped with a smile
Ubangi Stomp Ubangi Style Ubangi stomp with rock and roll
Beats anything that's ever been told
Ubangi Stomp Ubangi Style
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild Well, we rocked all night and part of the day
Had a good rocking time with the chief's daughter Mae
I was making time and gettin' in the know
The Captain said son we gotta go.
I said that's alright. You go on ahead
I'm gonna Ubangi Stomp until I roll over dead Ubangi stomp with rock and roll
Beats anything that you ever told
Ubangi Stomp Ubangi Style
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild
