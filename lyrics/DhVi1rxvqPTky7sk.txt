Another night in my new skin
Throw emotion to the wind
Just trying to find a face to make me feel something
And for all the pretty mouths and pretty words that turn me up
I just end up at your house twenty
Thousand leagues beneath the ocean

Oh
I've been trying to keep my distance
(I still need you, I'm still bleeding)
So hard to keep my distance
(I still need you, I'm still bleeding)

And you make me wanna stay 'cause you look so good
But I know you babe and this can't wait
Not one more touch, one more drink
One more minute, one more night

So I surrender
This is the moment I surrender

Now all the shapes I know are gone
The charts and maps I've drawn just get me lost
And I'm falling off the edge

And you make me wanna change with the look on your face
'Cause I miss you babe but I can't stay
Not one more kiss,
not one more fix, not one more minute, one more night

So I surrender
This is the moment I surrender
In and out, let it in
Oh Lord I surrender

(I still need you, I can't stay)
(Heart's still beating, I still can't stay)
I'm still trying to keep my distance
(Won't you send me back in time, break me again)
Keep my distance
(I still need you, I'm still bleeding)
When I speak will you listen?

So send me back a thousand days
That first night at your old place and tell me how it ends
I'd do it all again
For one more minute, one more night

If all that I could ever be
If all that I could ever be was the best ex-lover of your life
If all that I could ever be
If all that I could ever be was the best ex-lover of your life

So I surrender
This is the moment I surrender
In and out, let it in
Oh Lord I surrender
This is the moment I surrender

And all that I could ever be
And all that I could ever be was the best ex-lover of your life

Keep my distance
So hard to keep my distance
I'm still trying to keep my distance
