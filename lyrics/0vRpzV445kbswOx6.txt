She walked in and said she didn't wanna no anymore
(Anymore, anymore)
Before I could ask why she was gone out the door
(Out the door out the door)
And I didn't know (didn't know didn't know)
What I did wrong (I did wrong I did wrong)
But now I just can't move on

Since she left me (Since she left me), she told me (she told me)
Don't worry (don't worry), you'll be ok you don't need me
Believe me you'll be fine
Then I knew what she meant, and its not what she said
Now I can't believe she gone

(Danny)
I tried callin her up on her phone, no one's there
(No one's there, no one's home)
Well I've left messages after the tone... *beep*
'Really?' 'Yeah man, loads'
I didn't know (didn't know didn't know),
What I did wrong (I did wrong I did wrong),
But now I just can't move on, yeah yeah yeah

Since she left me (Since she left me), she told me (she told me)
Don't worry (don't worry), you'll be ok you don't need me
Believe me you'll be fine *ohhhhhhh*
Then I knew what she meant, and it's not what she said
Now I can't believe she gone
