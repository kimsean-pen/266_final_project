viva viva viva la radio
how i love my radio
i take it with me wherever i go
how i love to hear the sound
i like to play it nice and out loud

(chorus)
radi-o-ooo, that's it, i love it
radi-o-ooo, turn it up, turn it up
radi-o-ooo, louder, louder
radi-o-ooo, i love it, i love it
viva viva viva la radio (repeat x4)
how i wish i was a dj
i'd play my favourite music everyday
radio lolly is what it would be
and you can come and dance and party with me

(chorus)

salsa
viva viva viva la radio (repeat to fade)
