Josie, you're my source of most frustration
Forget, when I don't meet expectations
Everything you wished came true
In the end we all blamed you
Even though, as they all know
You weren't the only one, two, three, four
Why do you still keep it around
When you know it brings me down
I'm hating everything
And I know that you dated other guys
But I got to wonder why
You'd leave it out for me
(Shit)
Why am I still hanging around
When I know it brings me down
I'm hating everything
And you are getting rides home in his car
You're making out in his front yard
I'm hating everything
Please don't remind me
Put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me
I wish that it would end
And I am not fine
Last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine
Why can't we just pretend
And if we can have another day
I've got so much left to say
I'd tell you everything
And I'll laugh when I think about the past
When I see you after class
You're hating everything
Please don't remind me
Put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me
I wish that this would end
And I am not fine
Last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine
Why can't we just pretend
Please don't remind me
Put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me
I wish that this would end
And I am not fine
Last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine
Why can't we just pretend
She said "Na na na na"
"Na na na " "na na na na na"
(I just forgot you were there)
Na na na
(I just forgot you were there)
Please don't remind me
Put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me
I wish that this would end
And I am not fine
Last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine
Why can't we just pretend
Please don't remind me
Put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me
I wish that this would end
And I am not fine
Last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine
Why can't we just pretend
She said "Na na na na na"
