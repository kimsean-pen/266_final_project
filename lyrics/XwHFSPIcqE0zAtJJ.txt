When routine bites hard, ambitions are low
Resentment rides high but emotions won't grow
We're changing our ways taking different roads

Love will tear us apart again
Love will tear us apart again

Why is the bedroom so cold? Turned away from your side
Is my timing at fault [Incomprehensible] so dry?
Still there's an appeal that we've kept through our lives

Love will tear us apart again
Love will tear us apart again

Do you cry out in your sleep? All my failings exposed
There's a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold
Yet it's something so pure I just can't function no more

Love will tear us apart again
Love will tear us apart again
Love will tear us apart again
Love will tear us apart again
