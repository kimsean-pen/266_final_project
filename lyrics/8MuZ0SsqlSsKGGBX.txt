I am Silence

I left it all to escape that misguided place
I left it all to erase that familiar face
Now surely I have nearly reached an end
Soon I'll be all alone in my own Quiet World

I'll mold a world to accept my condition (my condition will be odd no more)
I'll show it that we can be broken and at peace
I'll make my world understand my condition (my condition will be odd no more)
I'll embrace my sinister side (drown out all the noise)
Begin a new life

Ca-Ra-Zu Ni-Mu Pa-Tu
He has created us from a
Point of view we did not choose
We are all broken, singing
Ca-Ra-Zu...

I can finally feel
That I belong
After all the shame and pain
My Quiet World is now complete

Behold my new dominion
You will understand

At last they all hear my voice
And this will make them see
That there is no being
In this world that will dare defy me
