Take a moment to think of just
flexibility, love, and trust.
Take a moment to think of just
flexibility, love, and trust.
Here comes a thought,
that might alarm you.
What someone said,
and how it harmed you.
Something you did,
that failed to be charming.
Things that you said are
suddenly swarming and, oh.
You're losing sight,
You're losing touch.
All these little things seem to matter so much,
that they confuse you,
That I might lose you.
Take a moment remind yourself to,
take a moment and find yourself,
Take a moment to ask yourself if
this is how we fall apart?
But it's not, but it's not, but it's not, but it's not, but it's not.
It's okay, It's okay, It's okay, It's okay, It's okay.
You've got nothing, got nothing, got nothing, got nothing to fear.
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.
And it was just a thought, just a thought, just a thought, just a thought, just a thought.
It's okay, It's okay, It's okay, It's okay, It's okay.
We can watch, we can watch, we can watch, we can watch them go by.
From here, from here, from here.
Take a moment to think of just
flexibility, love, and trust.
