Ruined your night, I'm not sorry
You've got no power over me now, now
You said that we should, I thought that I would
But I'm not your temple, is that understood?
Ruined your night, I'm not sorry

Ooh, you can't hold me down
Ooh, you can't break my crown
I don't know what you expected
Screaming out until you get it
No, you can't hold me down
Ooh, hold me down
Ooh, hold me down

Don't want your drinks now, that's enough
Can't put a price upon my love, my love
Just give me some space, you're up in my face
This Cleopatra, she knows you're a snake
Don't want your drinks now, that's enough

Ooh, you can't hold me down
Ooh, you can't break my crown
I don't know what you expected
Screaming out until you get it
No, you can't hold me down
Ooh, hold me down
Ooh, hold me down

I'm not staying up
I'm not staying up
I'm not staying up
All night, all night
Nothing you can touch
Nothing you can touch
Nothing you can touch
So high, so high
I'm not staying up
I'm not staying up
I'm not staying up
All night, all night
Nothing you can touch
Nothing you can touch
Nothing you can touch
So high, so high
Ooh, you can't hold me down
Ooh, you can't hold me down

Ooh, you can't hold me down
Ooh, you can't break my crown
I don't know what you expected
Screaming out until you get it
No, you can't hold me down
Ooh, hold me down
Ooh, hold me down
