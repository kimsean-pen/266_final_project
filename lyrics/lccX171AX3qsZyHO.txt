She's got a pretty smile
It covers up the poison that she hides
She walks around in circles in my head
Waiting for a chance to break me
A chance to take me down
Now I see this burden you gave me
Is too much to carry
Too much to bury inside

I guess you're the only one
Nobody changes
I guess you're the only one
Left standing when everything else goes down
You're still the only one
You're still the only one

It's all shallow and all so appealing
I'm up to my ankles and I'm drowning anyway in a sea of
Sarcastic faces
Familiar places
Everything looks
Quite the same here it's
All confusingly amusing bitter and tainted
The picture you painted to me

I guess you're the only one
Nobody changes
I guess you're the only one
Left standing when everything else goes down
You're still the only one
Who will never change faces
I guess you're the only one
Left standing when everything else goes down

Just 'cause it's all in your head
Doesn't mean it has to be in mine
Don't believe what you said
Still can't get it out of my mind
I've tried to find myself in approval
I've already been there
Already done that
It got me nowhere
It brought me nothing but
A good place to hide in
No one to confide in now

I guess you're the only one
Nobody changes
I guess you're the only one
Who will never change faces
I guess you're the only one
