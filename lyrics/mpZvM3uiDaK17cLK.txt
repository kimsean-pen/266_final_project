Burning all my cash
Sip and dash
Gotta find a way to close the
fucking gash in the back of my fucking head
What I'm thinking keeps leaking out
I don't want them to know what I'm thinking now
Now they asking why I'm singing now
Bitch I'm bored of fucking raps and I'm bringing out my guns
I'd dap you up but my hands busy holding the gun to my skull
Bitch, I told 10 Deep to keep your free clothes
Then me, $lick, and Smurf peaced out to go blow some clean dro
Worship the devil so people don't fuck with me
But it's okay cause I don't fuck with people
They don't understand our fucking lingo
Keep on digging myself into a deep hole

Everybody got a full clip
Always be fucking the same, bitch
Don't tell me how you're different
Shut the fuck up boy and listen
Couple hundred in my Swisha
Bitch I'm smoking on whatever
Don't let that bullshit effect us cause we ain't ever gonna let up
Make one call and you handled
I know some men with no future
Just some scumbag mother fuckers that'll cut up your shooter
Stoned and dead like Medusa
Trench coat hiding my ruger
I got them blades like I'm Krueger
Then I come back like looper
