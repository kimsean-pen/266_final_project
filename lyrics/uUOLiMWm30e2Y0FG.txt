The living ... have a look at the living:
Dancing blindly ... losing balance,
Will you chose pain ... or will you prefer the penance;
The penance.
The living ... have a look at the living:
Dancing blindly ... losing balance,
Will you chose pain ... or will you prefer the penance;
The penance.
The living and the undead,
The living and the undead.
A ballet of the living and the living dead:
Penance, penance & Pain;
Penance & Pain.
The living ... have a look at the living:
Dancing blindly ... losing balance,
Will you chose pain ... or will you prefer the penance;
The Penance.
Light and dark, two paths ahead,
Death to rebirth ... - or life undead;
Life undead.
One for the living,
One for the undead ... -
The undead, the undead, the undead.
Light and dark, two paths ahead,
Death to rebirth ... - or life undead;
Life undead.
One for the living, for the living,
Only for the living;
One for the undead, for the undead.
Life on one side,
Undeath on the other side ... - the darkest side:
"I don't belong to your side anymore.
I'm one of the undead",
This is what the pale boy said.
