Is it ok if I don't make it?
Is it ok if I don't come around?
The light is fading and the sun has gone down
Bring it on back, Bring it on back, Bring it on back

Where's the day that never ended?
Tell me when it's time to open up my eyes
Light the morning with the sun on the rise
Bring it on back, Bring it on back, Bring on back
Bring it on back, Bring it on back, Bring it on back

For all that you do
For all that you had
For all that you said
Would you take it all back?
When all that you see
Is much more than you have
I'll Bring it on back, Bring it on back, Bring it on back

You wont know me 'till you need me
But I won't let you down so open up your eyes
The day is done, the sun has set in the sky
Be on your way the sun has set in the sky
Bring it on back, Bring it on back, Bring it on back
Bring it on back, Bring it on back, Bring it on back

For all that you do
For all that you had
For all that you said
Would you take it all back?
When all that you see
Is much more than you have
I'll Bring it on back, Bring it on back, Bring it on back

Just because your eyes are open
Doesn't mean you can see
So where do we go?
Well, that's between you and me

For all that you do
For all that you had
For all that you said
Would you take it all back?
When all that you see
Is much more than you have
I'll Bring it on back, Bring it on back, Bring it on back
