We've been building this ship for years
'cause the river is made tears
And now we're drifting
Down the river of freedom

And now we're on our way
On our way...

The sails are made from our dreams
There'll be better days downstream
And now we're drifting
Down the river of freedom

And now we're on our way
On our way...

Please let our spirit last
We're raising up our last mast
And now we're drifting
Down the river of freedom

On our way
On our way
On our way
