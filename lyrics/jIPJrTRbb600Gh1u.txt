Me sleep, me sleep, like a shell to the future
A quite slight sigh, be a bubble
You sleep, you sleep, like a shell from the past
A quite slight tone, no end

You head to the end since you were born
Seeing and showing so many beautiful facts and lies
What is left in your hand? A piece of fossil
Spinning around and squeaking but still even that is taken by the wind

A cat is dying on your left but you just left it there
A bird is flying out from you but you just left it there
So many people passed by talking and smiling
You didn't say a word squeezing, so they now melted in the dark

Flies you spat out, now become sweet maggots
You put them and save them, but you suddenly smashed it down
You hear a far voice calling your name
You tried to go home to rest, but you know even now you don't have a home

You bleed and your flesh fell off
And a red line shows us your way

Me sleep, me sleep, like a shell to the future
A quite slight sigh, be a bubble
You sleep, you sleep, like a shell from the past
A quite slight tone, no end

You step on the stones, you throw cells out
Creating and showing so many shinny knives to rust
Is it your sin? Is it your pain?
You try to ignore and leave the place, but with them you got deep signs on your face

A cat is scratching, biting your shoes, you just left it there
A bird is shouting out sad songs loud, you just left it there
So many things passed by with sneaking and laughing
You don't chase and tame them, so they are now blown off in the air

You head to the end, you're still on the way
Seeing and showing so many beautiful facts and fakes
Where are you heading to? Where is your end to settle?
You will find out, if it is the deep sea, I can see you there
I can see you there
I can see you there

Your head spoiled and fell
Your feet split and melt
Your eyes shine, about to sink
I can kiss you, good-bye
