Ladies and gentlemen
You're steppin' out tonight
And I want you to do
I want you to give it up, come on

Give it up, girl, give it up
Give it up, girl, give it up

Finally the weekend's here, a party's goin' down
I'm in a mood to get it started
I wanna see you gettin' down on the dance floor

It's that classic so remastered funky sound
Whenever you rock with Kool & The Gang
You're guaranteed to dance

No more standin' around, get up, get down
If you feelin' this sound, come on, just give it up
Give it up to me, girl
Everybody put your hands together
Movin' your feet

Give it up, girl, give it up
Give it up, girl, give it up

Now I know that you can feel the rhythm of the groove
So come on and start, just rock this party
I wanna see you get out on the floor with your dance move

It's a party whenever the band comes through your town
Ain't nothin' wrong with doin' your thing
So come on y'all just dance

No more standin' around, get up, get down
If you fellin' this sound, come on just give it up
Give it up for me
Everybody put your hands together
Movin' your feet

Give it up, girl, give it up
Give it up, girl, give it up
Give it up, girl, give it up
Give it up, girl, give it up to me
