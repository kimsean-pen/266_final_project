Play with me,
Do what you want with me
You won't see me putting up a fight
Look at me
Look what you've done to me
Never let me go after tonight
This feeling that I feel
I don't wanna hide

Candlelight is how I like to see you
Say my name
In the darkness it's not the same
So come and kiss me
Before the sun goes down
'Cause in the darkness
it's not the same, it's not the same

Promise me, you'll wake up next to me
A lifetime, forever and a day
Stay with me, don't let our memories
Take from us the love we have today
This feeling that I feel
I don't wanna hide

Candlelight is how I like to see you
Say my name
In the darkness it's not the same
So come and kiss me
Before the sun goes down
'Cause in the darkness
it's not the same, it's not the same

I don't wanna hide, I don't wanna hide
I don't wanna hide
It's not the same
I don't wanna hide, I don't wanna hide
I don't wanna hide

Send the night away
Send the night away

Oh-oh-oh-oh

Send the night away
Send the night away

Oh-oh-oh-oh

This feeling that I feel
I don't wanna hide

Candlelight is how I like to see you
Say my name
In the darkness it's not the same
So come and kiss me
Before the sun goes down
'Cause in the darkness
it's not the same, it's not the same

I don't wanna hide, I don't wanna hide
I don't wanna hide
It's not the same
I don't wanna hide, I don't wanna hide
I don't wanna hide

Candlelight is how I like to see you
Say my name
In the darkness it's not the same
So come and kiss me
Before the sun goes down
'Cause in the darkness
it's not the same, it's not the same
