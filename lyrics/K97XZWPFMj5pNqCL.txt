Hey
She said "I know our days are numbered"
Oh since long ago
So hold me in this dream world
And never let me go

Oh
You know time just can't be trusted
To move like you want it to move
It pulls you into it's slip stream
And never lets you go
No, no, no

Truth be told be told
We used it on ourselves first
The mind hijacker's curse
It's slow and tender touch
Is now flying in our heads
And sleeping in our beds
Oh we learned the secrets of the kingdom
It slept on the bathroom floor
Your mind was leaking out the door
You're so scared to be adored
But more scared to be alone

She's got nobody
She's got no place where she belongs
She's got nobody
She's got no-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-body
She's got no place where she belongs
She's got nobody

She's got nobody
She's got no place where she belongs
She's got nobody
She's got no-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-body
She's got no place where she belongs
She's got nobody
