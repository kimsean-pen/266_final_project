Avery said he's got a cold comin' on
Climbed into bed, stayed all summer long
If I don't come out too soon
Maybe I'll hang on 'til June
Down on the knuckle

Sylvia knows a little hideaway
Scrawling out prose she couldn't give away
A life spent all indoors
Well, isn't that what doors are for?
Down on the knuckle

Down on the knuckle
Oh, the weather's dreary
Here down on the knuckle

Your relatives write their cheery monologues
Hoping you might find your only analog
So make another list
Of the mandatory things you've missed
Down on the knuckle

Down on the knuckle
Oh, aren't we lucky
Stuck here on the knuckle

The pillory's full for the holidays
And it's achingly dull to watch the paint peel away
So I'll keep hid with mine
And I'm sure that we'll make out just fine
Down on the knuckle

Down on the knuckle
I'm finally riding
Shiny, on the knuckle
Down on the knuckle
Oh, aren't we lucky
Stuck here on the knuckle
