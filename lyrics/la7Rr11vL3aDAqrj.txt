And if I'm wasting my time,
Then nothing could be better than hanging on the line,
And waiting for an honest word forever.

And if you're saying goodbye,
Please don't you think me bitter for recalling every rhyme
From the book, the page, the line, the word, the letter.

Well, the window's turning blue, and the water's ever flowing,
And I hope I'm not a fool for laughing at myself as you are going.
