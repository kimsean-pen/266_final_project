You used to make me feel like I could walk on water
Now most nights I'm just sinking down
And down
You're the reason why I can't listen to the same songs I used to

I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind

I've given up on you
But it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry
I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night

It's 4am and you're keeping me from closing these sleepy eyes
Does the thought of me keep you up at night?
Like the light on the ceiling of your bedroom
Lately
My dog's the only one around that listens to my problems

It's been a lonely year
It's been a lonely year
It's been a lonely year
It's been a lonely year

I write songs about you all the time
I bet I don't run through your mind

I've given up on you
But it still hurts to know you're not alone
Don't worry
I'll keep out of your life and stay awake at night
With just my skin and bones
It hurts to know you're not alone
I've given up on you
And my skin
And my bones
