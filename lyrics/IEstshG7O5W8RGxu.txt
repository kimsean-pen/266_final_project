Da na da na da na da na da na da na da na na
Da na da na da na da na da na da na da na na

Loves, not how it used to be
And the passion that made me strong
Is clearly breaking me

I scream you shout you're my favourite enemy
I wanna hurt you like you're hurting me
Up down your moods swing with more extremity
This heartache won't go away

I bruise when you get close
Feel my body choke
Bitter last blows
In the war with you
When you get close
Feel my body choke
So the pain grows
In the war with you

Da na da na da na (in the war with you)
Da na da na da na na

You're chasing I'm running
The weapons keep coming
Don't do it I'll lose it
I'm seeing red
I'm on low resistance
You better keep your distance
Before you do something you might regret

I scream you shout you're my favourite enemy
I wanna hurt you like you hurting me
Up down your words come with more intensity
This heartache wont go away

I bruise when you get close
Feel my body choke
Bitter last blows
In the war with you
When you get close
Feel my body choke
So the pain grows
In the war with you

Da na da na da na (in the war with you)
Da na da na da na (in the war with you)
Da na da na da na (in the war with you)
Da na da na da na na na

Though I bruise easy with you boy
I know you still got the power to hurt me
So
Stay out of my way now
Till loves gone, gone
So I can move on

I bruise when you get close
Feel my body choke
Bitter last blows
In the war with you
When you get close
Feel my body choke
So the pain grows
In the war with you

Still fighting in the war with you
Don't try and end the war with you
Still fighting in the war with you
Don't try and end the war with you
