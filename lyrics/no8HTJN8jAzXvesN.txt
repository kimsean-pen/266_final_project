Keeping it locked away
A secret on every page
But now you're getting close
Feels like dragon's breath
Fire against my chest
Burning through the snow

I can't hide it, I can't hide it
From you
In ultraviolet, ultraviolet
You see through
Ooh, ooh
No, I can't hide it
When you're ultraviolet

Keeping the darkest truth
Written in lemon juice
But you don't turn away
I can feel this magnetic force
Pull my eyes to yours
Pupils dilate

No, I can't fight it, I can't fight it
Don't want to
In ultraviolet, ultraviolet
You see through
Ooh, ooh
No, I can't hide it
You're ultraviolet
Ooh, ooh
No, I can't hide it

And you're reading all of me
And you're reading all of me
And you're reading all of me
Ooh, ooh
Not seeing what they see
Not seeing what they see, oh

I can't hide it, you're ultraviolet
Oh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
No, I can't hide, no, I can't hide it
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
No, I can't hide it, you're ultraviolet
