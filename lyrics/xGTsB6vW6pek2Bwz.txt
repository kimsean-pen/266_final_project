Turn the knob to reveal the light
Stare across the empty night
Dark worlds engrossing
Our sun is sleeping
The dance has lost it's step
The teeth will be shown no more
(Alone) Alone we finally escape
(Walking home) Alone we risk it all
Turn the knob to reveal the light
Stare across the empty night
The world has lost
Our minds roam free
The world has lost
Our minds roam free
