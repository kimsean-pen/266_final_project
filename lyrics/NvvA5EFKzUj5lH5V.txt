Someone's basement party,
backward and cross-dressed,
she's a circus girl in a shower of oranges.
She's a fabulous mess
and I wasn't quite at my best when I said
"you look like you'll never leave California."
I felt my fingers inching towards you oh so slow.
We got room to grow.
We got room to grow.
And I want to find out all the things the chaos brings.
There's something in you I believe in,
cause there's something in you I believe in.
I can't see the floor from the clothes from the night before
and we lay in a bed that's never made.
When she lets herself go she's like no one you'll ever know.
It was true then what I said to you a long time ago.
We got room to grow.
We got room to grow.
And I'll take you in no matter what your chaos brings.
There's something in you I believe in.
There's something in you I believe in.
There's something in you I believe in.
There's something in you I believe in.
There's something in you I believe in.
There's something in you I believe in.
There's something in you I believe in.
