Rise up!
I'm done falling down again

Rise up
Long time, I broke the chains

I tried to fly
A while
So high
Direction - sky, eh

My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow so high
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow so high
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow so high, eh

I tried to fly
A while
So high
Direction - sky

I tried to fly
A while
So high
Direction - sky eh

My dream
Is to fly
Over the rainbow
So high

My dream
Is to fly
Over the rainbow
So high

My dream
Is to fly
Over the rainbow
So high eh

Rise up, rise up, rise up
Will be the game

Rise up, rise up, rise up
For my mind and my brain

'Cause I try to fly
So high
Direction - sky

My dream
Is to fly
Over the rainbow
So high

My dream
Is to fly
Over the rainbow, eh

My dream
Is to fly
Over the rainbow
So high

My dream
Is to fly
Over the rainbow
So high
Eh!
