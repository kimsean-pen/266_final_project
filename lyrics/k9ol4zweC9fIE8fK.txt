And another day is done
Ages of nothing
And another hope is gone
Yearning for something
Waiting to be born
She said, I'm waiting to be born

And her walls are closing in
So painfully silent
She's a prisoner within
Lost on an island
Waiting to be born
She said, I'm waiting to be born

I close my eyes to my illusions
I turn away from all I've left behind
I kill the pain and my confusion
I'm not dying anymore
I'm waiting to be born

And her visions are concealed
Drowned in an ocean
And her face is frozen still
Hiding a notion
Waiting to be born
She said, i'm waiting to be born

She's not blind but she can't see
The shine of her colours
Someday soon she's going to leave
This maze full of crawlers
Waiting to be born
She knows, they're waiting to be born

I close my eyes to my illusions
I turn away from all I've left behind
I kill the pain and my confusion
I'm not dying anymore
I'm waiting to be born
