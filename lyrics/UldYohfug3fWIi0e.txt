Kong at the Gates (The Forbidden Zone)
Some say that's where man began
On this wasted piece of land
Where evolution's yet to show... Forbidden Zone
Blasting into outer space
The Planet of the Apes
Evolution's one hero...
A million years into the future
Crossing a path into another dimension
We the unseen
Back on Earth it's all you read about
All the evidence destroyed
Maps and legends mark the firewalls
We lost abandoned saviors...
Of the Forbidden Zone
We shall sustain the Forbidden Zone
