Why dont I like the girl I see
The one whos standing right in front of me
Why dont I think before I speak

I should have listened to that voice inside me
I must be stupid, must be crazy, must be out of my mind
To say the kind of things I said last night
Mirror mirror hanging on the wall

You dont have to tell me whos the biggest fool of all
Mirror mirror I wish you could lie to me
And bring my baby back, bring my baby back to me

(Mirror mirror lie to me)

(Show me what I wanna see)
(Mirror mirror lie to me)
(Show me what I wanna see)

Why did I let you walk away
When all I had to do was say Im sorry
I let my pride get in the way

And in the heat of the moment I was to blame
I must be stupid, must be crazy, must be out of my mind
Now in the cold light of the day I realize
Mirror mirror hanging on the wall

You dont have to tell me whos the biggest fool of all
Mirror mirror I wish you could lie to me
And bring my baby back, bring my baby back to me
If only wishes could be dreams

And know my dreams could come true
There would be two us standing here in front of you
If you could show me that someone that I used to be
Bring back my baby, my baby to me

Mirror mirror hanging on the wall
You dont have to tell me whos the biggest fool of all
Mirror mirror I wish you could lie to me
And bring my baby back, bring my baby back to me
Mirror mirror hanging on the wall
You dont have to tell me whos the biggest fool of all

Mirror mirror I wish you could lie to me
And bring my baby back, bring my baby back to me
(Mirror mirror lie to me)
(Show me what I wanna see)
(Mirror mirror lie to me)
To me...
(Mirror mirror lie to me)
(Show me what I wanna see)
(Mirror mirror lie to me)
(Mirror mirror lie to me)
