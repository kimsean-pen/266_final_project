Don, uh

Bitch, I been finessin' since the eighth grade
But now I'm gettin' paid just to show face
If your nigga bummy, tell that nigga skate
Most my bitches hoes but they never fake
Still won't pay the bill, even if I ate
I don't pay for meals, I don't go on dates
But I still get the cake ate
Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake

Toes on my page, livin' out my case
Block, b-b-blockin' that same pace
Bitch, I'm pretty, but I'm big poppin'
This ain't ordinary, got the guards watchin'
This ain't ordinary, ask my nigga Drake
He told me I'm the realest and them bitches fake

Never play the bench, I don't play it safe
Don't cut your nose just to spite your face
I stay livin' and I'm learnin' every day
Like I be chillin' fuckin' with the real estate
You never set trends if you don't take risks
This ain't my opinion, that's a practice

Secure, secure, secure
The bag secure, secure, secure
The bag secure, secure, secure
The bag secure, secure, secure
The bag

I stay livin' and I'm learnin' every day
Not everybody wanna see who win the race
I work hard just to lock this
I pray to God that he got this
I stay livin' and I'm learnin' every day
Not everybody wanna see who win the race
I work hard just to lock this
I pray to God that he got this
