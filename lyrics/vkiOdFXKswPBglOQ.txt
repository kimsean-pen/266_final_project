Lost in a haunting thought
Spinning me around once more
I wake, just to feel the weight
As the daylight comes around, I turn
With my eyes on the back door

Your face is light and cocaine white
one message beating through

Smoke's filled the air
And I'm struggling to breathe
Let them be calm so I finally can sleep
Everything you intended to say
Don't go back on your words
You always said you'd tell me first

Verse after endless verse
I can't escape the echoed words
I long, long to find a cure
For the fear that I find in these chords
I smile as it burns

Your face is light and cocaine white
One message beating through

I've been erased
I've been erased from the picture

Excuse, oh no, anything goes
Excuses, you know it doesn't work
Excuse, oh no, anything goes
Excuses don't work

Excuse me, this will close, I'm desperate
Excuse me, this will close, I'm desperate

Smoke's filled the air
And I'm struggling to breathe
Let them be calm so I finally can sleep
Everything you intended to say
Don't go back on your words
You always said you'd tell me first

Smoke's filled the air
And I'm struggling to breathe
Let them be calm so I finally can sleep
