Baby, here we are, waiting here for time, to play the game
Let love steal us away
Baby, here I am, holding charts to guide us through the storm
To a brighter, brighter day
You and I will be together many lessons, oh baby
From a past, that's lived too many lies
Yesterday is gone forever there's tomorrow
All that I can see
You and I living together
Just, you and I groovin' forever
Trusting every word, just to mean
What has been handed down in time we've known hurt before
Masters of my dreams, create a place to feel this love of mine
And never hurt no more
You and I will be together many lessons, oh baby
From a past, that's lived too many lies
Yesterday is gone forever there's tomorrow
All that I can see
You and I living together
Just, you and I groovin' forever
We must trust the dark
For showing us the stars
We must trust the rain
And open up our hearts
Just, you and I living together
You and I groovin' forever
You and I living together
You and I living together
You and I groovin' forever
Baby, you and I living together
You and I groovin' forever
Baby, you and I living together
Baby, you and I
