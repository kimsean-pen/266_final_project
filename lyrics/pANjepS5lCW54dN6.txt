Think I finally got your message
You won't just let me go and let you down
I'm one that knows bad decision
Making you chnage your mind around

And two is just company, three is a crowd
One keeps me grounded, and one in the clouds
Contradicting the things I thought I knew
So indecisive, don't know what to do

'Cause I want you, and you, and you, and you too
Can you really blame me wanting you?
And you, and you, and you too
Can you really blame me?
I want you

I'm still trying to break some habits
Sometimes I'm choosy or greedy or both
Don't we all come with some baggage
And I know I got more than most

We both know two is just company, three is a crowd
So far from grounded, and close to the clouds
Contradicting the things I thought I knew
So indecisive, it's so hard to choose

'Cause I want you, and you, and you, and you too
Can you really blame me wanting you?
And you, and you, and you too
Can you really blame me?
'Cause I want you, and you, and you, and you too
Can you really blame me wanting you?
And you, and you, and you too
Can you really blame me?

You know I like my options
I be switching and swapping
Pavin' the way no flopping
Bubblegum, you popping
Switching up my logo
Up and down like pogo
Show you off that's chromo
Always happens like slow-mo
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
We both, we both, got places we could go
And whether or not to stay, or turn and walk away
The way I feel will never change

Oh, you, and you, and you, and you, and you
Can you really blame me wanting you?
And you, and you, and you too
Can you really choose?
I want you, and you, and you, and you too
Can you really blame me wanting you?
And you, and you, and you too
Can you really blame me?

You know I like my options
I be switching and swapping
