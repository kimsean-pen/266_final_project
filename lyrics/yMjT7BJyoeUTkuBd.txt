If music is a mirror revealing the depths of my heart
Then I will write the darkest song
For without forgiveness my soul is lost

All that is hope within destruction
Comes from you, for I have fallen
All that is hope within destruction
Comes from you, for I have fallen, fallen

If music is a mirror
Revealing the depths of my heart
Then I will write the darkest song
For without forgiveness
My soul is lost

All that is hope
Within destruction, comes from you

For I have fallen
And there is nothing good within me, yet I've
Been given life I will never, never deserve
For without forgiveness
Without forgiveness my soul is lost

All that is hope within destruction
All that is hope within destruction
All that is hope within destruction
All that is hope within destruction

All that this hope
All that this hope
All that this hope
All that this hope
