The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came
The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came
The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came
The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came
The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came

The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came
The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came
The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came
The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came
The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came
The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came
