Heaven must have sent you

Now I don't know where you come from, baby
Don't know where you've been, my baby
But heaven must have sent you
Heaven must have sent you

Heaven must have sent you

Heaven must have sent you

So long I've needed love right near me
Have some boys to cheer me
Heaven must have sent you, honey
Heaven must have sent you

So long I've needed love right near me (I needed love)
Have some boys to cheer me
Heaven must have sent you, honey
Heaven must have sent you

Oh baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Love you more each day

It's a heaven in your arms
Boy, it's the sweetness of your charms
Makes me love you more each day
In your arms I want to stay

Heaven must have sent you
