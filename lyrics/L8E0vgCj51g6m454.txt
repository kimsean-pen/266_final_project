In between these white hotels
The parallel pavements are peaceful
The fallen leaves from flakey trees
That decorate car bonnets
I had this beautiful day-dreaming moment
The sun was shining strangely amber
Shouldered by flickering golden-green avenues
And city-doves perching on vapour trails
Then we saw from the upper deck
Watching ourselves as if seeing our future
Greeted by strangers who seemed to be
Good friends and welcomed us through
Their shiny red door...
... That's about then when my dream
Began fading out and hearing me
Thoughts of ambivalence.
