Everything means everything or nothing, means nothing
So why hide your expletives under your breath?
'Cause all you ever wanna do, is take all my clothes off
So you can show me there's no reason to be upset

You could convince me to, tie my hair back
Relive the years I've left behind
You could convince me to, stay up all night with you while
You leave me underdressed and out of time

Underdressed and I'm all out of time
Take me to the fucking roof, made it
Give me just a little truth, leave me
Underdressed and I'm all out of time
Take me to a different view, change it
All I ever wanna do is, stay here (stay, stay, stay here)

Everything means everything and nothing, is numbing
Can't avoid the consequence, so don't get upset (upset)
'Cause all you ever wanna do
Is take all my clothes off
Watch me make you promises I can regret

You could convince me to, tie my hair back
Relive the years I've left behind
You could convince me to, stay up all night with you while
You leave me underdressed and out of time

Underdressed and I'm all out of time
Take me to the fucking roof, made it
Give me just a little truth, leave me
Underdressed and I'm all out of time
Take me to a different view, change it
All I ever wanna do is, stay here

Stay here
Stay here
Stay here
Stay here

Underdressed and I'm all out of time
Take me to the fucking roof, made it
Give me just a little truth, leave me
Underdressed and I'm all out of time
Take me to a different view, change it
All I ever wanna do is, stay here

(All I ever wanna do is stay)
(All I ever wanna do is stay)
(All I ever wanna do is stay)
(All I ever wanna do is stay here)
