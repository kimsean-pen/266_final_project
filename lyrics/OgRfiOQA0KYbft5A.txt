The wild boys are calling on their way back from the fire
in august moon's surrender to a dust cloud on the rise
wild boys fallen far from glory

reckless and so hungered on the razors edge you trail
because there's murder by the roadside in a sore afraid new world
they tried to break us, looks like they'll try again
Wild boys never lose it
wild boys never chose this way

wild boys never close your eyes

wild boys always shine
You got sirens for a welcome there's bloodstain for your pain
and your telephone been ringing while you're dancing in the rain
wild boys wonder where is glory

where is all you angels now the figureheads have fell
and lovers war with arrows over secrets they could tell
they tried to tame you looks like they'll try again
Wild boys never lose it
wild boys never chose this way
wild boys never close your eyes
wild boys always shine
