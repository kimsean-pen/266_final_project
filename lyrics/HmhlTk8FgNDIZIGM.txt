I got the moves
when you see me
on a saturday night
I got the moves
jukebox playing
and the music's alright
I got the moves
hey hey
I think I do
hey hey
I think you do too
I got the moves
but see me shakin
on the dance floor alone
they wanna dance
but I promise
that I tell 'em all no
I got the moves
hey hey
I think I do
