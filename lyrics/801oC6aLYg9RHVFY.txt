The back and forth repeat, it's nothing new,
I'm not who I want to be for you,
eager eyes got a funny way of shinning through,
just before the bore and you say,
"the bridge looks like it's made with K's,"
for my name,
shaped just like your right hand veins,
paler than the salt stacks in the rain,
burnt sulfur sparks tonight,
that Gold Club sign lights up just right,
it gets covered by the ivy in the summertime,
I turn sharp and I race by,
we all rush, it always stays,
so serene, and I can't change,
you know that's just my way and your eyes say,
"come inside, warm those hands,"
well, what can I say with so little time?
Still honest, a kind face, it's fitting, such a waste,
that "good night" kind of smile,
it faded with my time,
I'm getting close to who I want to be for you,
I'm getting close, I'm racing home,
I'm getting that ribcage rattle,
I'm getting close, I'm racing home,
I'm "choking on feel good,"
I'm getting close, I'm racing home,
the back and forth repeat,
I'm getting close, I'm racing home.
