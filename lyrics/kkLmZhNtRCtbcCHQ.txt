Throw it, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out

Strip clubs and dollar bills
I still got mo' money
Patron shots, can I get a refill
I still got mo' money
Strippers going up and down that pole
And I still got mo' money
Four o'clock and we aint going home
'Cause I still got mo' money
Money make the world go around
I still got mo' money
Bands make your girl go down
And I still got mo' money
Lot more where dat came from
I still got mo' money
I look in your eyes, I know you want some
And I still got mo' money

Oh ohh ohhh, ohhh oh oh oh
All I see is signs
All I see is dollar signs
Oh ohh ohhh, ohhh oh oh oh
Money on my mind
Money, money on my mind

Throw it, throw it up
Watch it fall out from the sky
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out

Valet cost a hundred bills
And I still got mo' money
Gold all up in my grill
I still got mo' money
Who cares how you haters feel
And I still got mo' money
Call Jay up and close the deal
'Cause I still got mo' money
My fragance on and they love my smell
I still got mo' money
So who cares about what I spend?
I still got mo' money
My pockets deep and they never end
And I still got mo' money
I'm going dumb with all my friends
And I still got mo' money

Oh ohh ohhh, ohhh oh oh oh
All I see is signs
All I see is dollar signs
Oh ohh ohhh, ohhh oh oh oh
Money on my mind
Money, money on my mind

Throw it, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
