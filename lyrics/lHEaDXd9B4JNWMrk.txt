Well I can't forget this evening
And your face when you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in you eyes your sorrow shows
Yes it shows
Well I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
I had you there
And then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
Can't give any more
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
Can't give any more
Well I can't forget this evening
And your face when you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile
but in you eyes your sorrow shows

Yes it shows
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
Can't give any more
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
Can't give any more
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
Can't give any more
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
Can't give any more
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
Can't give any more
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
Can't give any more
I can't live
(If living is without you)
