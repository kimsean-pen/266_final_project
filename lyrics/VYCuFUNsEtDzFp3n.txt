Oh sweet architect
My bones are heavy and my soul's a mess
I can't find my address
Build me up, build me up
Oh sweet architect
I've been lonely since the day you left
So come and find my address
Build me up, build me up

Guess we've got deep love, but it's a deeper ocean
Dear God help us keep floating
See some choke and some panic
Some got a boat, but most haven't
Oh dear heaven, you know we're tryin' make it
But dear heaven, you know it's complicated
We've got deep love, but it's a deeper ocean
We've got deep love

Oh sweet architect
My bones are heavy and my soul's a mess
I can't find my address
Build me up, build me up
Oh sweet architect
I've been lonely since the day you left
So come and find my address
Build me up, build me up

Help me, we're still hearing, we're still breathing
Knee deep with the deep kneeling
We stay brave looking, we've been damaged
See most got a heart, but some's damaged
Oh dear heaven, I hope you're up to something
Cause dear heaven, this just can't be for nothing
We're still here, we're still breathing
We're still here

Oh sweet architect
My bones are heavy and my soul's a mess
I can't find my address
Build me up, build me up
Oh sweet architect
I've been lonely since the day you left
So come and find my address
Build me up, build me up

Build me up, build me up
Build me up, build me up
Build me up, build me up
Build me up, build me up
Build me up, build me up
Build me up, build me up
Build me up, build me up
Build me up, build me up

Oh sweet architect
My bones are heavy and my soul's a mess
I can't find my address
Build me up, build me up
Oh sweet architect
I've been lonely since the day you left
So come and find my address
Build me up, build me up

Guess we've got deep love, but it's a deeper ocean
Dear God help us keep floating
See some choke and some panic
Some got a boat, but most haven't
Oh dear heaven, you know we're tryin' make it
Oh dear heaven, you know it's complicated
We've got deep love, but it's a deeper ocean
We've got deep love
