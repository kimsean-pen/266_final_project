The dry air holds a distinct fascination
For those who are unfamiliar
For those who are unfamiliar
with any other way of living
and I can see by their eyes
Can see by your eyes
Can see by your eyes
But I can't see
I can't see by my eyes

I remember
The morning I awoke
I remember, but not very well
Marinating in a pool, a puddle of blood
and urine
My own urine and
Someone else's blood
My own urine
vSomeone else's blood
and I can see by their eyes
I can see by your eyes
I can see by your eyes
But I can't see
I can't see by my eyes

That lady so ugly
She looks like Dra-cu-la
