I don't wanna live
To be thirty-four
I don't wanna die
In a nuclear war

Go on out
Get some more
Go on out
To the bar, the market or the liquor store

I don't wanna live
To be forty-three
I don't like
What I see going on around me

Go on out
Get some more
Go on out
Get fucked up and pass out on the floor

Go on out
Get some more
Go on out
To your favorite liquor store

Go on out
Don't worry about it no more
Go on out
Get fucked up on the floor

I don't wanna live
To be fifty-seven
I'm living in Hell
Is there a Heaven?

Live fast! (Fast!)
Die young! (Young!)
Live fast!
Die young!
Live fast, die young!
