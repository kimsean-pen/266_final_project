Hey!
Forgive me father
Up all night I'm going under
I don't wanna be like you
And you don't wanna be like me

Hey!
I play with matches
Roll that dice and hope for magic
I try to let the river flow
And take me somewhere I don't know

Oh oh oh
Wild horses in the night
I'm running for my life
Yeah

I try
To give myself away
To give into the chase
Night turns into day
I drive
Drive into the moon
I pray for something new
No matter what I do

All roads lead to you
All roads lead to you
Hey! Can you feel that thunder?
Get in line and take a number
'Cause we don't wanna be like them
And they don't wanna be like us

Hey!
I've crossed the ocean
Wiped my mind with a million potions
Try'na run away from you
It's a game I think I'll always lose

Oh oh oh
Wild horses in the night
I'm running for my life
Yeah

I try
To give myself away
To give into the chase
Night turns into day

I drive
Drive into the moon
I pray for something new
No matter what I do

All roads lead to you
All roads lead to you
All roads lead to you

No matter what I do
Every road leads right back to you
If I win or lose
Every road leads right back to you
No matter what I do
Every road leads right back to you
If I win or lose
Every road leads right back to you

Oh oh oh
Wild horses in the night
I'm running for my life
Yeah

I try
To give myself away
To give into the chase
Night turns into day

I drive
Drive into the moon
I pray for something new
No matter what I do

All roads lead to you
All roads lead to you
All roads lead to you

No matter what I do
Every road leads right back to you
If I win or lose
Every road leads right back to you
No matter what I do
Every road leads right back to you
If I win or lose
All road lead to you
