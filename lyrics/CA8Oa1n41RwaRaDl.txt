Looking down on empty streets, all she can see
Are the dreams all made solid
Are the dreams made real

All of the buildings, all of the cars
Were once just a dream
In somebody's head

She pictures the broken glass, pictures the steam
She pictures a soul
With no leak at the seam

Let's take the boat out
Wait until darkness
Let's take the boat out
Wait until darkness comes

Nowhere in the corridors of pale green and gray
Nowhere in the suburbs
In the cold light of day

There in the midst of it, so alive and alone
Words support like bone

Dreaming of Mercy Street
Where you're inside out
Dreaming of mercy
In your daddy's arms again
Dreaming of Mercy Street
Swear they moved that sign
Dreaming of mercy
In your daddy's arms

Pulling out the papers from the drawers that slide smooth
Tugging at the darkness, word upon word
Confessing all the secret things in the warm velvet box
To the priest, he's the doctor
He can handle the shocks

Dreaming of the tenderness
The tremble in the hips
Of kissing Mary's lips

Dreaming of Mercy Street
Where you're inside out
Dreaming of mercy
In your daddy's arms again
Dreaming of Mercy Street
Swear they moved that sign
Looking for mercy
In your daddy's arms

Anne, with her father, is out in the boat
Riding the water
Riding the waves on the sea
