Another wait and I let it fall, it's anyway
You got me down on my knees for a single way
And when the time is done, alone we wore
Oh, I cannot feel this way

Wo, this is the kiss of the cobra king
Wo, this is the kiss of the cobra
Wo, this is the kiss of the cobra king
Wo, this is the kiss of the cobra

And when they come and I see the town, anyway
Another fall and I lose the love, true mistake
You feel the mirror in my eyes coming out
Oh, I cannot feel this way

Wo, this is the kiss of the cobra king
Wo, this is the kiss of the cobra
Wo, this is the kiss of the cobra king
Wo, this is the kiss of the cobra

Woah, woah

Wo, this is the kiss of the cobra king
Wo, this is the kiss of the cobra
Wo, this is the kiss of the cobra king
Wo, this is the kiss of the cobra
