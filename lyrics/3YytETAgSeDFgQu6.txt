I heard you got too lit last night
Didn't make it home
Mixin' purple with your purple sprite
Things you should've known

I heard you flexin' on 'em, yeah
You wanna mix it up
But fuck it, baby, no regret
And never switch it up

Too Turnt
Last night you showed me all that ratchet shit that you learned
I showed her how to treat a Lambo like an Uber
Dancing naked on a table, that's the true her
It was a vibe if you wanna know

I heard you got too lit last night
Didn't make it home
Mixin' purple with your purple sprite
Girl, you think you grown

I heard you saucin' on 'em, yeah
You said you sick of love
But fuck it, baby, no regret
And never switch it up

Okay, one pill had her looking like Naomi
And two pills had her looking like my soulmate
Me and three bad bitches call it foreplay
It's just a vibe if you wanna know

I heard you got too lit last night
Didn't make it home
Mixin' purple with your purple sprite
Things you should've known

I heard you saucin' on 'em, yeah
You said you sick of love
But fuck it, baby, no regret
And never switch it up

I know, I know tonight you're getting higher than your high hopes
Last night was only you and I on your iPhone
So promise you won't tell nobody, baby, I won't
It's just a vibe if you wanna know

Pullin' up like this
Flexin' on my wrist
Last night I did way too lit, I forget
Panties on my dash
Pictures with no flash
This life too fast, take me back, take me back

Aye, I heard you got too lit last night
Didn't make it home
Mixin' purple with your purple sprite
Things you should've known

I heard you flexin' on 'em, yeah
You said you sick of love
But fuck it, baby, no regret
And never switch it up
