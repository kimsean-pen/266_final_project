The suspense is wild
The more I think of you
The more I melt like ice cream
Baby 'cos the heat of you
Has got me cravin'
And there's nothin' I can do (do)

And the feeling won't stop
'Cos I'm fire red hot
Like I'm ready to pop
It's a kinda excitement
I cannot explain
Oh here I go again
I can feel it coming

And its like a flash of night
Inside theres something going on
Exploding inside me like a cherry bomb
And the thought of you
Fills me with a sweet surprise
Come to me tonight (babe, babe)
I'm feeling dynamite (babe, babe)
My heart is a delicious cherry bomb

Oh these thoughts are killer
They sit on the tip of my tongue
Like a cube of sugar
Got a rush and I can't get enough
'Cos there's somethin' about you
Got me deep in love (love)

And the feeling won't stop
'Cos I'm fire red hot
Like I'm ready to pop
And I'm spinning around
With this passion I found
Oh here I go again
I can feel it coming

And its like a flash of night
Inside theres something going on
Exploding inside me like a cherry bomb
And the thought of you
Fills me with a sweet surprise
Come to me tonight (babe, babe)
I'm feeling dynamite (babe, babe)
My heart is a delicious cherry bomb

Cherry bomb, bomb
Cherry bomb

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooohhh
Cherry bomb
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooohhh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooohhh
Cherry bomb

And its like a flash of night
Inside theres something going on
Exploding inside me like a cherry bomb
And the thought of you
Fills me with a sweet surprise
Come to me tonight (babe, babe)
I'm feeling dynamite (babe, babe)
My heart is a delicious cherry bomb
