You and me we're made, it's impossible to say to me
Together always
Then you moved away to the capital of England
I hoped you stay there

Once you asked me what I'm thinking
I lay back and think of England
Do you know my real answer?
I was born to be a dancer

Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh

I came down at your on the National Express
Request to touch your breasts
And there, I found that you, you were hanging with crowd
Alone, of cheats and liars

Do you know what I've been thinking?
I lay back and think of England
Do you know my real answer?
I was born to be a dancer

Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh

Once you asked me what I'm thinking?
I lay back and think of England
Do you know my real answer?
I was born to be a dancer

Do you know what I've been thinking?
I lay back and think of England
Do you know my real answer?
I was born to be a dancer

Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh
