In a world with no grey
Saying black and white things, doing all the tight things
Judging every day
Laughing at me daily, calling people crazy
Hearing it over with friends
Beginning to sound like it's true again
Look for the first way out
People keep staring, it's physical now

And I don't ever wanna see them again
Said I don't ever wanna see them

No school, down to the bitter
Put chill in the air, it's making me quiver
No rules, teacher is a douchebag
Said I'm a mess and I'm gonna need rehab
Cool, everyone hates me
Gonna move away and be a star, that's crazy
Cool, it's cool, it's cool
No school, no school, no school

Had to smile with the times
Acting like it's nothing, holding suns above me
Finding reasons to lie
Imaginary pushups, telling them to shut up
Hearing it over again
Screaming and shouting gets in my head
Searching for my way out
Trying to walk, smile, and scream and shout

And I don't ever wanna see them again
Said I don't ever wanna see them

No school, down to the bitter
Put chill in the air, it's making me quiver
No rules, teacher is a douchebag
Said I'm a mess and I'm gonna need rehab
Cool, everyone hates me
Gonna move away and be a star, that's crazy
Cool, it's cool, it's cool
No school, no school, no school

And I don't ever wanna see them again
And I don't ever wanna see them again
And I don't ever wanna see them again
And I don't ever wanna see them again
And I don't ever wanna see them again
And I don't ever wanna see them again
And I don't ever wanna see them again
And I don't ever wanna see them again
