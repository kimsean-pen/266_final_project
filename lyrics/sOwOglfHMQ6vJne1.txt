I know it's not your fault, but I'm a locked door
Anytime I'm a mess by someone before
And I wish that I, I could find a key
To unlock all the things that you want us to be
Let me open up and start again
But there's a safe around my heart
I don't know how to let you in
And that's what keeps us apart
And that's why I need time.
I said I need you
I need you to understand, you, you, you Call up the locksmith
Tell him we need him quick
We've got a million keys
None of them seem to fit
While you're on the phone
Call up the clocksmith
Cuz I could use some time
Even the slightest bit
Let me open up and start again
And break this safe around my heart
I don't know how to let you in
And that's what keeps us apart
And that's why I need time
I said I need you
I need you to understand, you, you, you I'm thinking now's the time
Maybe it's time to go, if I gave you my heart, be gentle
I'm tired of laying low, lets give the world a show
And when you know, you know
And when you know, you know, you know
And when you know, you know, you know, you know
And that's why I need time
I said I need you
I need you to understand, you, you, you I need you to understand I need you I need you, you, you
