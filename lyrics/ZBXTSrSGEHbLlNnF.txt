Ooh, It's alright, oh

Oh hey, I had a night I had a day
I did one million stupid things
I said one billion foolish things
I'm not okay, I got a baseball bat beside my bed
To fight off what's inside my head
To fight off what's behind my meds
I'm lonely, lost in pain

It's alright, it's okay, it's alright, it's okay
You're not a monster, just a human
And you made a few mistakes
It's alright, it's okay, it's alright, it's okay
You're not gruesome, just human
And you made a few mistakes
It's alright
Ooh, it's okay
Ooh, it's alright, oh

Goddamn
I throw a brick right through the window
My life ignored the signals
I'm high and drunk on ego, can't see straight
So I just feel my way around and
I'm touching and I'm grabbing
Everything I can't be havin'
I am broken down in shame

It's alright, It's okay, it's alright, it's okay
You're not a demon, there's a reason
You behaved in that way
It's alright, it's okay, it's alright, it's okay
And I believe, yes I believe that you will see a better day
It's alright
Ooh, it's okay
Ooh, it's alright
Ooh

Ah-ah-ah-ah
I don't wanna know who I am
Cause heaven only knows what I'll find
I don't wanna know I'm not capable
Of coming out alive
I don't wanna see what's inside
I think that I would rather be blind
I don't wanna know I'm not capable, I'm capable

I'm alright, I'm okay, I'm alright, I'm okay
I'm not a monster, I'm a human
And I've made a few mistakes
I'm alright, I'm okay, I'm alright, I'm okay
I'm not gruesome, just human
And I've made a few
It's alright, It's okay, it's alright, it's okay
You're not a demon, there's a reason
You behaved in that way
It's alright, it's okay, it's alright, it's okay
I believe, yes I believe that you will see a better day
It's alright (Ooh)
It's okay (Ooh)
It's alright (Ooh)
And I believe, yes I believe that you will see a better day
It's alright
