Over time I've come to see
That I'm no better off
Hungry is the ghost inside
And nothing seems to stop

I am a night breaker
And air slings back to you
Looking through the windows
To other people's rooms

Thought I saw you in a store
Just a sign of wanting more
Hungry is the ghost
Breathe
Hungry is the ghost
Inside of me
Inside of me
Inside, inside, inside of me

I can never be satisfied
When the sun drops
See the time moving slow
I want it to stop

I am a night breaker
And air slings back to you
Looking through the windows
To other people's rooms

Thought I saw you in a store
Just a sign of wanting more
It's the beginning of June
And I don't know what to do
Hungry is the ghost
Breathe
Hungry is the ghost
Inside of me
Inside of me
Inside, inside, inside of me
