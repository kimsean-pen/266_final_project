Alone he stands in the doorway,
His family's still asleep.
Gazing at the starlit horizon
And the moonsparking sea.

When dawn comes he must leave them,
His home, his children and loved.
For his destiny beyond those waves
Known only to the Norns.

He's already dressed ready to leave,
His four friends are waiting by the shore.
Each with a dragon ship
And one hundred men prepared for war.

He returns to his bed kissing
His sleeping wife goodbye.
And as he leaves his youngest son
A tear rolls from his eye.

They set sail with the first morning rays,
Heading for glorious wars.
And as the five ships steer out from the bay
Their hearts pound like never before.

The wind is strong, the sun is warm,
Their dragons fly' across the waves.
No greenfaces are seen here onboard,
Only a crowd of braves.

Many night pass
And days long as a year.
They await the battle,
They await without fear.

On the morning the fifth day,
Before the sun arose,
They hear bells chime and see pyres
Torched at a nearby coast.

"LOWER THE SAIL, GRAB YOUR OARS, NOW MEN IT'S TIME TO ACT!
ROW LIKE THE WIND TO THE SHORE, ROW LIKE THE WIND TO ATTACK!"
