Oh, let's start it over
As I come back and forth
Through the causes of my mistakes
Well you said it over and over
Don't come back, don't come around my kid
Well I'm already in, and we all
Give it, give it, give it all, slow it down
Give it, give it, give it all, slow it down
Give it, give it, give it all, slow it down
Give it, give it, give it all

Shut it down (You'll go far on the back of a potato)
Shut it down (Making French fries in the snow)
Shut it down (Then you'll steal, then you'll borrow)
(You'll be red, you'll be gold)
(Then you'll steal)
(Then you'll steal)
(Then you'll steal)
(Then you're right, somebody getting farther then getting to the better of the betting, alright?)
(Then you're right, somebody getting farther then getting to the better of the betting, alright?)

Smooth out the street
Move your feet
Let it out, let it out, let it out
Place the blame on my hand
let it out, let it out, give it all
Give it, give it, give it all, slow it down
Give it, give it, give it all, slow it down
Give it, give it, give it all, slow it down
Give it, give it, give it all

Shut it down (You'll go far on the back of a potato)
Shut it down (Making French fries in the snow)
Shut it down (Then you'll steal, then you'll borrow)
(You'll be red, you'll be gold)
(Then you'll steal)
(Then you'll steal)
(Then you'll steal)
(Then you're right, somebody getting farther then getting to the better of the betting, alright?)
(Then you're right, somebody getting farther then getting to the better of the betting, alright?)

Stop, let it go, oh wonder, now
Stop, let it go, oh wonder, now
Do, do, do, do, do, don't move
Do, do, do, do, do, don't move
Baby stay put
Do, do, do, do, do, don't move
Do, do, do, don't move
Baby stay put

Well, I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you
I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you
Well, I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you (Hey man, I'm bumping bleedo)
I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you (Blee blee doe)
Well, I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you (Hey man, I'm bumping bleedo)
I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you (Blee blee doe)

"Yeah"
"Alright, bye"
"Alright let's go"
