Lord it's so hard, living this life
ah constant struggle each and every day
Some wonder why I'd rather die
than to continue living this way
Many are blind and cannot find
the truth cuz no-one seems to really know
But I won't accept that this is how it's gon to be
Devil ya got ta let me and my people go

Cuz I wanna be free
Completely free
Lord won't you please come and save me
Cuz I wanna be free
