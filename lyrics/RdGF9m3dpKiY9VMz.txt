Working in the corner
Peeking over shoulders
Waiting for my time to come
Working in the corner
One day to the other
Butter for my piece of bun

Working in the corner
Peeking over shoulders
Waiting for my time to come
Working in the corner
One day to the other
Butter for my piece of bun

Stepping, I'm stomping, I'm all gone
Give me the tone and I'm all gone
Yeah, I'm walking by the line
Not here, but in my mind

I'm working, I sweat but it's all good
I'm breaking my back but it's all good
'Cause I know I'll get it back
Yeah, I know your hands will clap
Yet, I'm looking, yet, I'm working
To make butter for my piece of bun

And if you say, I'm not okay, we must go
If you say there ain't no way that I could know
If you say I aim too high from down below
Well, say you're not 'cause when I'm gone
You'll be calling but I won't be at the phone

And you hanging around 'til it's all done
You can't keep me back once I had some
No wasting time to get it right
And you will see what I'm about

Good, I'm working, I sweat, but it's all good
I'm breaking my back but it's all good
'Cause I know I'll get it back
Yeah, I know your hands will clap

And if you say I'm not okay, we must go
If you say there ain't no way that I could know
If you say, I aim too high from down below
Well, say you're not 'cause when I'm gone
You'll be calling but I won't be at the phone

Working in the corner
Peeking over shoulders
Waiting for my time to come

And if you say I'm not okay, we must go
If you say there ain't no way that I could know
If you say I aim too high from down below
Well, say you're not 'cause when I'm gone
You'll be calling but I won't be

If you say I'm not okay, we must go
If you say there ain't no way that I could know
If you say I aim too high from down below
Well, say you're not 'cause when I'm gone
You'll be calling but I won't be at the phone
