I met you in the past
I met you in the past
But I forgot to ask your name, name, name
I kept you in my dreams
I kept you in my dreams
But it only seems to feed the flame, flame, flame
Give me another chance
To break me from this trance
To get you in my hands again, again, again

Oh fill my empty bones
For I was a heavy stone
Fill my fill my hollow bones
Hear my lonesome moans

I met you in the past
I met you in the past
But I forgot to ask your name, name, name
I kept you in my dreams
I kept you in my dreams
But it only seems to feed the flame, flame, flame

Oh fill my empty bones
For I was a heavy stone
Fill my fill my hollow bones
Hear my lonesome moans

Now I can't leave it be
Your goddamn memory
Has taken over me
And your face is all I see

Being young and feeling old
And having just my dream to hold
Lurkin' searchin' on the road
To find the only love I know
Being young and feeling old
And having just my dream to hold
Lurkin' searchin' on the road
To find the only love I know

Now I can't leave it be
Your goddamn memory
Has taken over me
And your face is all I see
Zombie around I run around
And wind up in the same town
I run around
Like a dirty hound
Until you're found

Being young and feeling old
And having just my dream to hold
Wild night of lust now only in my mind
I knew i couldn't trust this treacherous heart of mine
Wild night of lust now only in my mind
I knew i couldn't trust this treacherous heart of mine
Wild night of lust now only in my mind
