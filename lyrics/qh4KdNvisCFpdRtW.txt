My hands are in motion
My wheels do not change
My pain I turn into heat
Inside these flames
When time has no meanin'
Where seasons don't change
I dream with the heart of a thief
And I don't feel no shame

There's an island
In my soul
There's desire
Burnin' deep down, down below

Dance demons
Lose control
This is a metal a metal tango
Dance demons
Don't you know
This is a metal a metal tango
This is a metal... tango

The sky is cryin'
The tears fall like rain
The wind it gave me the key
To unlock these chains

There's an island
In my soul
There's desire
Burnin' deep down, down below

Dance demons
Lose control
This is a metal a metal tango
Dance demons
Don't you know
This is a metal a metal tango
This is a metal... tango

There's desire
In my soul
Burnin' deep down, down below

Dance demons
Lose control
This is a metal a metal tango
Dance demons
Don't you know
This is a metal a metal tango
This is a metal... tango

Don't you know
This is a metal tango
This is a metal tango
Don't you know
This is a metal tango
