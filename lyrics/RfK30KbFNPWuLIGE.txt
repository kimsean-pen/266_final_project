He once appeared
A harmless threat
A leader wrapped in linen.
United fools, bewitched by words,
In pact with ignorance.

A powermind, dictating thoughts,
that leads toward his dream
To free the world, fanatically
Religious slavery.

Khomaniak - your holy war is a tragedy
Fataliac - won't your God let you see

And lead by this, insane old man
From shah to battlefield
No one's too young, to fight and die
For what this man believes

Someone must die, insanity's alive
Spreads with disease, the virus increase

A voice in my ear says - "Khomaniac"
Your killing is pointless - "Fataliac"
The war is eternal - "Khomaniac"
The outcome infernal

That voice in my ear says - "Khomaniac"
Your killing is pointless - "Fataliac"
The war is eternal - "Khomaniac"
The outcome infernal - So die
