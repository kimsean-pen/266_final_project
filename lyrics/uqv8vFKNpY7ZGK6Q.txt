1, 2, 3 yes

I want to found out a way to say this
But there are never enough words, yeah yeah
A love to make you proud of, I will be some dead
I'm the son that leans for you, yeah yeah yeah

The one that makes me see is Daddy
You're the one that keeps me going

Keep the sparkle in your eyes, no
It's your health that gets me through, yeah yeah
In the past I never got you
Now I'm wiser
All the goods that you do
There's such tenderness in you, yeah yeah yeah

The one that makes me see is Daddy
You're the one that keeps me going
The one who makes me dream is Daddy
You're the one I keep beside me

One??? will always linger
Nowhere without you
Seen like this is all for you, all for you

The one that makes me see is my Daddy
You're the one that always get me going!
Get me going
The one who makes me dream is Daddy
You're the one I keep beside me
