And you said it would be funny
to keep me hanging in suspense,
then I'd run over to your house
and I'd scale the chain link fence
that, borders your back yard
and that I'd climb through your window
and I'd whisper that I love you
as you fall out of your clothes

And we'd lay there in the darkness
like the dream of you I had
where we captured all the fireflies
and we knew what time we had
could be counted on our finger tips
that almost made you cry
you let me hold you tightly
as we said all our goodbyes

may I say I loved you more
may I say I loved you more

and it must have been an hour
that I clutched you in my arms
and I must have said the the right things
because you instantly felt warm
and you heard my heart stop beating
and you wanted not to cry
as your sympathetic whispers
they told a tale of bad goodbyes

and you swore you saw me laughing
and I swore I saw you smile
and this time we spent together
has got to last us quite awhile
as I take this piece of you with me
I'll carry it to my grave
knowing that for someone you're an angel sent to save

(Keep breathing my angel, if you go down I go down with you)
may I say I loved you more
(keep breathing, just keep breathing)
may I say I loved you more

let's drink to the memories that we shared
down one to all the hopes and cares
here's too for being unaware, that you're gone
because before too long you'll be a memory

let's drink to the memories that we shared
(before too long you'll be a memory)
down one to all the hopes and cares
(because before too long you'll be a memory)
here's too for being unaware
(I said before too long you'll be a memory)
that you're gone
I said before too long you'll be a memory
