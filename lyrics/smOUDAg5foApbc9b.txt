The common road seems just like a dream
It's a mystery to me
Fills me within when we're together
Oh, baby, can't you see?

I, I'd like to feel the passion
To the point of no return
I will be in full reaction
I'm gonna take you in my arms

You're taking me to the point of no return, oh oh oh
You're taking me to the point of no return, oh oh oh
It took so long, well I treasure now

The love you gave to me
And when you smile, it warms my heart in need
Oh, baby, can't you see?
I, I'd like to feel the passion

To the point of no return, oh, baby
I will be in full reaction
I'm gonna take you in my arms
You're taking me to the point of no return, oh oh oh

You're taking me to the point of no return, oh oh oh

I wanna be with you, baby (ooh-wah ooh-wah)
I'm gonna be by your side (by your side)
I wanna be with you, baby (ooh-wah ooh-wah)
I'm gonna love you every night
You're taking me to the point of no return, oh oh oh
You're taking me to the point of no return, oh oh oh
You're taking me to the point of no return, oh oh oh
You're taking me to the point of no return, oh oh oh
You're taking me to the point of no return, oh oh oh
You're taking me to the point of no return
You're taking me to the point of no return
