Ponders, Yet you're undecided
I sprinkle looks to let you know
Pain is a wave, Come on let's ride it
Jump on now, Or We'll have to row
Now, while your eyes run back
The memories attack
I'll give you my last crack
The dreams keep me awake
Feelings seem hard to shake
Same way I always fake
Dripping off, you come to meet me
Break off a piece, to let you know
And they bubble all around you
Yeah there's a love
But it won't show
And while your eyes run back
The memories attack
I'll give you one last crack
The dreams keep me awake
Feelings seem hard to shake
Same way I always flake
Need a way to keep it simple
All the times I bailed, you float
Girl you reachin for your anchor
I turned it down
Right down your throat
