Einar
But, I'll teach the little angles
I'll take the harp away
But I'll teach them how to use the harmonica
I'll just do something like...

My punctuality is well known
When the revolution takes place
I'll be late And
I'll be shot as a traitor

Björk
When the sun rises

Einar
When the sun rises
I will not see
I regret nothing
It was worth it
Going through life without a timepiece
Did pay off

Björk
The sun rises

Einar
My reward to be free
And alone even now at the pillar
Blindfold at sunrise
Hearing the drums
Of Catalan beating my time away

Björk
The sun rises I will not see

Einar
My heartbeat keeps time
With the drums.
but soon my only pulse will fade away

Björk
The sun rises I will not see

Einar
I smile just knowing
When the sun rises
I will not see.
