From the thick of the woods, in a shimmering land
the moon up above and lights up the air
with a blood red moon rings, it should come as no surprise
To the place with the meaning only few understands
to gather in six only nature ------
the willow then sings, as to offer a surprise
one can't stand without the other
an evil will outrun
a war can't be avoided but it can be won
under the blood red moon
the blood red moon
under the blood red moon
the blood red moon
under the blood red moon
I can sit and watch that history unfold
I can draw my own destiny and brake up the mold
So what if I'm a witch, should it come as a surprise?
A valley of fear I walk each day
but a circle of six now shows me the way
And now I climb mountains, wherever they may rise
But I can't stand without you others, and you are nothing without me
We've been ready all our lives to set the power free
under the blood red moon
the blood red moon
under the blood red moon
the blood red moon
under the blood red moon
But I can't stand without you others
and you are nothing without me
We've been ready all our lives to set the power free
under the blood red moon
the blood red moon
under the blood red moon
the blood red moon
under the blood red moon
the blood red moon
under the blood red moon
the blood red moon
under the blood red moon
the blood red moon
the blood red moon
the blood red moon
under the blood red moon
