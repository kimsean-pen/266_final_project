It ain't easy Livin' like a gypsy Tell ya honey how I feel
I've been dreamin' Floatin' down the stream n' Losin' touch with all that's real
Whole earth lover Keepin' under cover Never know where ya been
You've been fadin' Always out paradin' Keep in touch with Mama Kin

Well you've always got your tail on the wag
Shootin' fire from your mouth Just like a dragon
You act like a perpertual drag

You better check it out 'Cause someday soon you'll have to Climb back on the wagon
It ain't easy Livin' like you wanna It's so hard to find peace of mind
Yes it is
The way I see it You gotta say shit But don't forget to drop me a line
Said, you're bald as an egg when you're eighteen
Workin' for your dad is just a drag
You still stuff your mouth with your dreams
You better check it out 'Cause someday soon you'll have to Climb back on the wagon

Keep in touch with Mama Kin
Tell her where you've gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and smokin' tea
