When the serpent swallows its tail,
With a half-eaten heart.
The god of reason deserts me.
Only earth and sky remain;
Mountains shake and wake me.
Words of the seeress reveal.

Carve out my eye that I might see,
Treacherous thoughts unfold
In time and show their nature.
Bleed the pig of its lies.

On the wind we're forced to call.
Call upon the fates as always.

On the wind we're forced to call.
Call upon the fates as always.

Scrape the black tar from your past life.
Let its weight burn away.
Stand within the guiding power.
Its current draws you clean.
