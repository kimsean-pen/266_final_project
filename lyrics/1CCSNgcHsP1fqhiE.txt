Just down the street from your hotel, baby,
I stay at home with my disease,
And ain't this position familiar, darling,
Well, all monkeys do what they see,
Help me stay awake, I'm falling.

Down on Virginia and La Loma,
Where I got friends who'll care for me,
You got an attitude of everything I ever wanted,
I got an attitude of need,
So help me stay awake, I'm falling.

Asleep in perfect blue buildings,
Beside the green apple sea,
I wanna get me a little oblivion baby,
Try to keep myself away from me.

It's 4: 30 A.M. on a Tuesday,
And it doesn't get much worse than this,
In beds in little rooms in buildings in the middle,
Of these lives which are completely meaningless,
Help me stay awake, I'm falling.

Asleep in perfect blue buildings,
Beside the green apple sea,
I wanna get me a little oblivion baby,
Try to keep myself away from myself and me.

Well I got bones beneath my skin, and mister,
There's a skeleton in every man's house,
Beneath the dust and love and sweat that hangs on everybody,
There's a dead man trying to get out,
So please help me stay awake, I'm falling.

Asleep in perfect blue buildings,
Beside the green apple sea,
I wanna get me a little oblivion baby,
Try to keep myself away from me.

Perfect blue buildings, oh,
Beside the green apple sea,
I wanna get me a little oblivion baby,
Try to keep myself away from myself and me.

Oh, in the perfect blue buildings,
I can't keep myself away from me,
Oh, in the perfect blue buildings,
Said how 'm I gonna keep myself,
How 'm I gonna keep myself away from me,
Keep myself away,
How 'm I gonna keep myself away from me,
Keep myself away,
How 'm I gonna keep myself away from me.
