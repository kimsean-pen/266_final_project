As I lay in the confines of my own mind
And the cracks I find
I wonder if I wasted your time
Bringing you here
I watched the flood of your crystal clear tears
As they slipped from your eyes
As I slipped from your mind

Oh my, to be hurt in love
Well darling, that's certain love
Yeah to be hurt in love
Oh darling that's certain love
(Oh to be hurt in love yeah that's certain love)
(As I lay on the outside of my own mind)

Yeah it's cold tonight
Yeah the feeling is no good
Yeah the feels not right
So I'll just hold on tight
I hear the strangest sounds
Falling down this holes in the ground
I can't think
Held back tears but I won't blink
As I stand on the brink

Oh to be hurt in love
To be hurt in love
Well darling that's certain love
Yeah to be hurt in love
Oh darling that's certain love
