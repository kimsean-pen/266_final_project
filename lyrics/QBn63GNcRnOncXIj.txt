Time may heal the wounds
but I will kill you

Slowly
fading all away

Look out your window
to what the wind blows

Slowly
fading all away

I won't stop
until your dead
because of voices in my head
I won't stop
until your dead
Helping you
and hurting me

Time will heal the wounds but I
will kill you

Slowly
fading all away

Hear
the voices cry and watch
the feelings die

Slowly
fading all away

I won't stop
until your dead
because of voices in my head
I won't stop
until your dead
Helping you
and hurting me

Time will heal the wounds
But I will kill you

Slowly
fading all away
