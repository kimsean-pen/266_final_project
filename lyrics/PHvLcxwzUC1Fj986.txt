Shutters on my house
Keep the sunlight in
If that's not enough to keep the people out

Then I don't wanna know what's on the other side

Turn on the TV
I wonder who thinks of it all
We could be watching the same thing

But I always shock myself when I plug it into the wall

So should I ask?
Are you home?

I can't keep anything down
All I hear is static buzz
And it's all echoing through my bedroom wall

Cover me in flies
They're breaking through the door
That'll show the garbage man
What everyone else is always so bitter for

So should I ask? Are you home?

I can't keep anything down
All I hear is static buzz
And it's all echoing through my bedroom wall
