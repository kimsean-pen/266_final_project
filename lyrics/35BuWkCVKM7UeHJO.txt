Under neon lights, we claim this town
No one can take us down
No, not tonight
City Boys and City Girls
Runnin' Wild

Burning like a fallin' star
Golden stardust, that's what we are
Young voices carry on
Come together in the same ole song

We're still here
We're shadows falling
The night is calling again

We're still here
Where love is running
The night is calling, again
(Brother to Brother)

Another night
Another town
Walking my heart around
Same old choices, again

Like so many tears in the rain
Will they remember your name
Young hearts reach fearlessly
In the night

We're still here
We're shadows falling
The night is calling again

We're still here
Where love is running
The night is calling, again
(Sister to Sister)

We're all together
(You know, I care)
We are...
(We will)
Always
(Be together)

We're still here
We're shadows falling
The night is calling again
We're still here
Where love is running
The night is calling, again
(Brother to Brother)
Brother to Brother
(Sister to Sister)

We're still here
Where love is running
The night is calling, again
