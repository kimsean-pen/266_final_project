Was it all in real time or was it just in my mind?
Was I just a ghost passing through you?
Clinging to the wreckage till I got the message
Hanging at the edge of the room
Give me something that's real
Give me half of your bitterest pill

Something from under the surface
You actually feel
We say these words again and again
But they still sound the same

It was in your eyes, in your eyes
They were just easy lies
The lightest words are heavy and promises are easy
And no one's ever happy or sad for very long

Well just because I said it, it doesn't mean I meant it
I guess that was the way all along
I'm just shaping the sound
I'm just turning the syllables round
Dipping my toe in the water
And watching you drown

We say these words again and again
But they still sound the same
It was in my eyes, in my eyes
They were just easy lies

And it's been a long time waiting
And it's been a lifetime in the making, oh
We said "When you are alone and afraid
I will come to your aid"

Was it just a dream, just a dream?
'Cause it was real to me
We say these words again and again
But they still sound the same
We say these words again and again
And again and again
