You always hurt the one you love
The one you shouldn't hurt at all
You always take the sweetest rose
And crush it till the petals fall

You always break the kindest heart
With a hasty word you can't recall, so
If I broke your heart last night
Because I love you most of all

You always hurt the one you love
The one you shouldn't hurt at all
You always take the sweetest rose
And crush it till the petals fall

You always hurt the one...
You always hurt the one...
You always hurt the one...
You always hurt the one...
The one you love most of all

You always hurt the one you love
The one who you shouldn't hurt at all
You always take the sweetest rose
And crush it till the petals fall

You always hurt the one you... Always
Hurt the one you... Always
Hurt the one you... Always
Hurt the one you... Always
Hurt the one you... Always
Hurt the one you... Always
Hurt the one you...
Always...
