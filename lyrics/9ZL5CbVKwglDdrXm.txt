What'll we do with the baby-o?
What'll we do with the baby?
What'll we do with the baby-o?

Wrap him up in a tablecloth
Throw him up in the old hayloft
That's what we do with the baby
That's what we do with the baby-o

Every time the baby grins,
Give my baby another bottle of gin
That's what we do with the baby
That's what we do with the baby-o

Every time the baby cries
Stick my finger in the babies eyes
That's what we do with the baby
That's what we do with the baby-o
