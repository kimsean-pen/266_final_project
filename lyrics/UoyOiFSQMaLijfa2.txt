Stare at the wall
Pray for reflection
Try to recall
Beg for redemption

Lost amid the lines
Vie for salvation
Solace is mine
Doused in temptation
Now I'm on my way

I'm chipping away at my denial
With my innocence on trial
It's all the same, an endless maze
With no tomorrow

I am detained, behind the door
It's a madness with no cure
I'm locked in chains
Drowned in shame
No fear or sorrow

'Cause it takes me in
And I can't let go
But I'll never win
In this labyrinth

Finding my way into the light
By the darkness of the night
A path so clear, release my fear
No strength to borrow

'Cause it takes me in
And I can't let go
But I'll never win
In this labyrinth

Oh, whoa whoa
Oh, whoa whoa
Oh, whoa whoa

Shows no mercy, we're in denial
One more stage and we'll reconcile
Time stands still in this virtual land
There's no winning this losing hand

Spinning around, falling away
Losing my mind and pounding my brain
Taking me down, turning to grey
Gotta got out, help me to escape

I need an answer now
'Cause I'm bound to lose my mind
I'm spinning round and round
But darkness is all I find

Spinning around, falling away
Losing my mind and pounding my brain
Taking me down, going insane
Gotta got out, help me to escape

Taking me down, I'm going insane
Get me out, get me out, help me escape
Ow!

'Cause it takes me in
And I can't let go
But I'll never win
In this labyrinth

Yeah
Oh, whoa whoa
Oh, whoa whoa
Oh, whoa whoa, oh
