To the night time she's burning
Happen the which way she was turning
And I still know the pain
She brought me live one day
She was always somewhere behind me
Thought there was something she was hiding
But now I found the truth
The thing she'll never use

Liar liar
She's on fire
She's waiting there
Around the corner
Just a little air
And she'll jump on ya

It's a quarter to midnight
And she's leaving
Just when she thought I was sleeping
And I could not believe
The things that I had seen
When was the right time I caught her
And she was dead in the water
I found her in her tracks
She heard me answer back

Liar liar
She's on fire
She's waiting there
Around the corner
Just a little air
And she'll jump on ya

Liar liar oh oh oh
I need the sun to keep me dry
Liar liar oh oh oh
The way you got me swimming through your life
Liar liar oh oh oh
Keep hearing voices in my mind saying
The problem with her lifestyle she's in denial

Liar liar
She's on fire
She's waiting there
Around the corner
Just a little air
And she'll jump on ya
Liar liar
She's on fire
She's waiting there
Around the corner
Just a little air
And she'll jump on ya
