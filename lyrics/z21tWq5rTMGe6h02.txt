Lying beside you
This joy is so deep
I reach out and touch you, tenderly
Looking inside you,
my world is complete
I struggled to find you
now I'm free

Your precious love burning so deeply
Shining completely for you
So blessed amazingly
Touching you now awakens me
You are my heart, my everything
Feeling you now is all I need, yeah
Adrift in a moment so sacred and pure
Alive for you only, I am yours
As you touch me so sweetly and you whisper my name
I feel how you love me we are the same
Your precious one, don't ever leave me
Forever need me this way
So blessed amazingly
Touching you now awakens me
You are my heart, my everything
Feeling you now is all I need
Stay with me beyond the end
I treasure you, 'cause you made me whole again
So, so blessed amazingly
Touching you now awakens me
You are my heart, my everything
Feeling you now is all I, all I really need, yeah
Feeling you now is all I need
