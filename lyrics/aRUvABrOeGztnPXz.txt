Oh No, No more, make it stop, one, two ahhh

She's been looking at me sideways
Even me and all my weekday
It's too bad that you'll never know
Cuz I can't, can't afford to let it show

She can't believe it, but I don't love you anymore
I just don't feel it, even though the cash will keep me warm

You looks at it's where it's at
Sorry girl I'll be right back
She feels every second that it takes
Not me every dollar I can't make

She can't believe it, but I don't love you anymore
I just don't feel it, even though the cash will keep me warm
She can't believe it, but I don't love you anymore
I just don't feel it, even though the cash will keep me warm
