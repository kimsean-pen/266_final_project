write me write to me
write me what I want to hear
I'm sick of talking
don't want to hear
unbearable talking
I had blatantly redundant year
write me write to me
write me what I want to hear
don't say a word
I'm sick of talking
unbearable talking
I had blatantly redundant year
voice makes no sense at all
it is disgusting for me
I feel fantastic without it
I'll make a confession tonight
you have a silly voice
I feel fantastic without it
