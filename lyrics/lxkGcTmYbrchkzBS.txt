I feel crazy
While you seem insane
I saw lightning
But you just see rain
I hear music
That's my heart being played

In your shadow I pray

It's a beautiful mess you made
You've had your fun and games
I love you,

To you that means so much less
You're like the tear in my brand new dress
It's a beautiful mess

The rush remains
as I watch you go
Your kiss still lingers
But it's killing me slow
As I shiver in this space where I lay

In your shadow I pray

It's a beautiful mess you made
You've had your fun and games
I love you
To you that means so much less
You're like the tear in my brand new dress
It's a beautiful mess

It was an innocent mistake
To waste my time on you
When they tell you not to go there
Don't care
And you do

In your shadow I pray

It's a beautiful mess you made
You've had your fun and games
I love you
To you that means so much less
You're like the tear in my brand new dress
And now I'm left with this beautiful mess
