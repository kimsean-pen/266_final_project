One man to sail the oceans
One man to leave the ground behind
Deep down we strive to be more than we are
Tamed the fire and the world was ours

We built it up reaching for the heavens
A pile of stone to stand the test of time
We brought light to shame the sun
And we always found a way

And I don't care if you don't care
'Cause our dreams have always taken us where
Amazing fantasies
Become today's realities

We will be victorious
With a blink of an eye we ascend to the sky
We'll be glorious, victorious we rise
'Cause we're gonna be, and won't stop 'til we are victorious

One man to split the atom
One man to tread another world
Inside we know that we have what it takes
Faster, stronger, higher than before

The spoken word, the ink on paper
Astounding beauty for the eyes and ears
All this when we stand together
When we stand as one

I don't care if you don't care
'Cause our dreams will always take us where
Amazing fantasies
Become today's realities

We will be victorious
In the blink of an eye we ascend to the sky
We'll be glorious, victorious
Somehow we'll rise to the challenge

But fading are our smiles
Confidence is fleeting
Embrace this plight
And yield before the fire

Understand this time we cannot make it alone
Our failure is forever
Through the wind and rain
Pushing through the masses
Went against the grain
As she opened up our eyes
For us to see
Crying out, an angel to reveal her mystery

Our saviour in the dark
I know, she can sway their minds
I promise she will never let us down
Of course she will defend our way of life

Here we stand before the world
The solution is simple, the answer is her
We'll send one of us for all of us
To ensure that our voice will be heard

We will be victorious
In the blink of an eye, she'll be sent to the sky
We'll be glorious, victorious we rise
Yes, we're gonna be victorious
