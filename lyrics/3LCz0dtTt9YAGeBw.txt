If I'm your salvation
Welcome to hell

If your looking to me
I must confess
Unlike an answer, lost deep
In loneliness
I'm just a question
I'm just full of passion
You aim and you miss

If we keep fighting who we are
Won't hit anything
It's like stabbing in the dark
Stabbing in the dark
It's like I feel to much, feel too
Much, but I can't find my heart
It's like I'm stabbing in the dark
Stabbing in the dark
It's like I think too much, think too
Much, and then I fall apart
Like stabbing in the dark

Eyes set on me
like I'm an answer
Just a question you missed
A complete disaster
Just a person
probably the worst one
Loose-lipped and shoulders chipped
If we keep fighting who we are
We won't hit anything

It's like I'm stabbing in the dark
stabbing in the dark
It's like I feel too much, feel too
much, but I can't find my heart
It's like I'm stabbing in the dark
Stabbing in the dark
It's like I think too much, think too
Much, and then I fall apart

Yet, still...
I'm here...
I'm singing for you

Yet, still...
I'm here...
I'm singing for you

It's like I'm stabbing in the dark
Stabbing in the dark
It's like I feel too much, feel too
Much, but I can't find my heart
It's like I'm stabbing in the dark
Stabbing in the dark
It's like I think too much, think too
Much, and then I fall apart
Like stabbing in the dark
I'm singing for you
Still I'm here
I'm singing for you
