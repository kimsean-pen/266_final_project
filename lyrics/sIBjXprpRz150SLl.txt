I'm at home smoking weed all day
Scratch marks on my escalade
And you gotta be the antidote
I tattooed you right on my brain
Then why you wanna watch me drown?
Act up when I come around?
Flex up when we're making out?
Tell me how I just run you down
Those lips that I kissed today
Made up in but in a foreign way
Stretch marks in my favorite place
I hate love but in a crazy way
Boy, you ain't gonna lay me down
Creased up in a paper crown
Peace'd up at your parents house
All day, all day

Why you gotta say mean things about me?
Why you gotta say mean things about me?
Why you gotta say mean things about me?
Why you gotta say mean things about me?

Small rips on your skinny jeans
Your tattoos, I wear it on my sleeve
Your password ends in twenty-three
Not safe, no way
You play dead like emergency
Your pants off, in your jewellery
We make up so when the choir sings
I miss us, miss we
Speaker blown on the driver's side
Say your tape gonna fly you high
But all I hear is some overdrive
All day, all day

Why you gotta say mean things about me?
Why you gotta say mean things about me?
Why you gotta say mean things about me?
Why you gotta say mean things about me?

So why-y-y can't you
Can't you lay down your arms for me?

Why you gotta say mean things about me?
Why you gotta say mean things about me?
Why you gotta say mean things about me?
Why you gotta say mean things about me?

I bet, I bet you are, mmhm
How am I supposed to believe that?
Why am I not surprised at all?
You know it's you
You're just saying that
Nah, that shit's not true
Rejjie
