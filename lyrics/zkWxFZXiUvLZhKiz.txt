Brushed my hair, went downstairs
Favorite jeans on my rear
And I looked up in my mirror
And I said, "Who's that there?
Who's that there in that mirror?"
I don't care and they're aware
Now I see just why they stare
I just pay them, I don't care
I know

So what I got a attitude?
Bitch, I got a attitude
So what I got a attitude?
Bitch, I got a

I don't sleep, I don't snore
Too much money out that door
On my way to go to work
Bills to pay, so hit that dirt
Change of plans, then "Juvenile" came on
You know that's my favorite song
I was 15 minutes late because I tried to be great
Dancing on my fate
Your opinion, not today
They said, "What's it gonna take?"
I said I wanna bigger plate
Told that lady pour my drink
Then I went up on my rate
I could see the bitch was fake
So like Chapo, I escaped
And I told dat hoe, "No
Like my ex, you got to go
I want all my money upfront
If you don't, guess what"

I'm, I'm gonna have a attitude
Bitch, I got a attitude
I'm gonna have a attitude

When they ask me where I've been
Busy
When they ask me where I live
The city
I don't own a welcome mat
Give me the proper feet and stand back
I don't own a welcome mat
Give me the proper feet and stand back
