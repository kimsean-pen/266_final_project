I know how to speak
And I know where I'm going
I wanted to seek
But I got distracted

It's a mirage
One that leaves me embarrassed
'Cause no one knows me like you
You know there's nothing left for you
So I continually knew
Try to pass it through for you
'Cause I bore you

Pestered by pain
It's time, listen honest
So let go of your shame
It's a dead, dampening blanket

It's a facade
I can look at you training
There's nobody else like you
I think I finally explained it
So I continue to move
Between the bank and the blanket
Don't fake it

I, I'm really gonna try this time
Gonna give you my heart in spite of my soul
I, I'm really gonna to try this time
Gonna give you my heart in spite of my soul

I want your name
Burnt in my ceiling
Floats like a flame
An unpredictable wonder

You gave it all hope
And all the of this is a circle
There's nobody else like you
So many that came before you
This is the moment I choose
Between the hope and the hardest
So be honest

I'm really gonna try this time
Gonna give you my heart in spite of my soul
I'm really gonna try this time
Gonna give you my heart in spite of my soul
