If you were a teacher
I would fail your class
Take it over and over
til you noticed me
If you were a waiting room
I would never see a doctor
I would sit there with my first aid kit and bleed
I wanna be the power ballad
that lifts you up and holds you down
I wanna be the broken love song
that feeds your misery
But I can wish all that I would
but it won't bring us together
Plus that I know
whatever happens to me
It's for the better...
And when the broken body all washed ashore
Who am I to ask you for more, more, more?
But you're breathing in my open mouth
You're the gun in my lips that will blow my brains out
I want to make you drive all night
just because I said maybe you should come over
I want to make you fall in love
as hard as my poor parents teenage daughter
She'll be the best you ever had if you let her
I know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
I know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
I know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
know it's for the better
(know it's for the better)
(know it's for the better)
(know it's for the better)
(know it's for the better)
(know it's for the better)
(know it's for the better)
(know it's for the better)
(know it's for the better)
(know it's for the better)
(know it's for the better)
(know it's for the better)
