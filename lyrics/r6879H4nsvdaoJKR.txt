Told ya'll I was gonna bump like this
Ya'll didn't think that I could bump like this
Said I told ya'll I was gonna bump like this
Turn around then I make it jump like this (Ladies!)
You wanna keep that boy
That make it jump like this
Let him think that I can make it bump like this
See I told ya'll I was gonna jump like this
How you not gon' know it when it hits like this?

Ladies, drama, leave it - home
If he ain't got it right by now
Then scratch him - off
They just called me
Said it's about - twenty strong
Standing at the door they wanna take us - on
The ring, let it go bout three months ago
The pain, the stressin'
Ain't in me no mo'
The girl that they used to know - done changed
Now they say a "Miss" befo' they mention my name

Told ya'll I was gonna bump like this
Ya'll didn't think that I could bump like this
Said I told ya'll I was gonna bump like this
Turn around then I make it jump like this (Ladies!)
You wanna keep that boy
That make it jump like this
Let him think that I can make it bump like this
See I told ya'll I was gonna jump like this
How you not gon' know it when it hits like this?

See satellite, 664 came up crept slow

Or come too bold
Cuz the quick ain't fo' me
Got my gurls all here with me

Pop a bottle

Ladies can u feel it, it's a anthem u can bounce around
Gave u just a sip to take ya breath

Dudes get excited, seeing what they likin
Hopin they the one u choose, hope they get invited
Late night rendevous's is alright
But we loving how the club vibratin, it's enticin'
Back the beat knock, trust me we ain't gon' stop
Head til the lights up, watch us take ova the spot
Few mad looks from them chicks, u know
And from them dudes who be jealous
Of a chick wit dough, pop anotha bottle fa dem
Keep my life movin, no time fa the drama
Watch me blow thru them, I know I sound confident
I'm sposed to tho, we do it big how we live
Kelly told you so, come on
