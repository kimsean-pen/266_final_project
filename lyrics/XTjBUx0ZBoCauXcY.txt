The grass and the daisies
Think a lot more of the days than you
And you're you

The walls of the maze
Know the will more than the way than you
And you're just you

The buttons on my phone
Know I hate to be alone
When I dial, I'm in denial

But now at least I know
Where it is I have to go
I need supplies before I arrive

"You're running down my thigh," she said
"He's such a wonderful guy," she said
"There's pride in wanting to die,
I think I'll give it a try," she said
"I can't make it on my own
And it's so hard to be alone
When I die
I'll be alright"
And now at least she knows
Where it is she has to go
She'll need supplies before she arrives

We're not gonna die like this (oh no)
We're not gonna die like this (oh no)
Sing it with me, it goes like this
We're not gonna die like this

HUM-MING-BIRD

Fly away little hummingbird!
