I ain't gettin' no younger
So boy when I say love
I don't say it just to say love
I know better
And if you never showed love
Don't think I would've known love
Gotta put it in my song love
And sing it over and over

I told my mama that I love you
My brother asked me where I met you
Said I saw you last Tuesday on the corner of 1st and Love
I heard you whistling my favorite song
When I saw you that morning on the corner of 1st and Love

Right there
Right there
Now I wanna sing it to the world
He's right there
Right there
On the corner of 1st and Love

I put my hand on my heart
I felt it beat like a bass drum
I heard Cupid in my ear
He said he never saw better
I gave him a straight shot
And it hit me like a moving truck
I hauled like an atom bomb
But it never felt so good

I told my mama that I love you
My brother asked me where I met you
Said I saw you last Tuesday on the corner of 1st and Love
I heard you whistling my favorite song
When I saw you that morning on the corner of 1st and Love

Right there
Right there
Now I wanna sing it to the world
He's right there
Right there
On the corner of 1st and Love

This ain't serendipity
No
I know that it's meant to be love
Don't feel like luck to me
No
Know that it had to be love
Like our names carved on a tree
The memories inside of me
Don't know how long forever is
Would you stay with me
And find out with me
Oh if the sun don't rise for weeks
Baby that's alright with me
Can't add to infinity
But if you stay with me
You can count on me

Right there
Right there
Now I wanna sing it to the world
He's right there
Right there
On the corner of 1st and Love

I saw you by the street signs
Oh I saw you by the street signs
That read 1st and Love
Love, love, love
