Oh yeah
Baby i can't stop thinking bout last night
Still taste your kiss
Still taste the wine
Tryin to turn this ten minute drive to five

Oh, Ive been day dreaming bout you all day long
Radio's been playing all our songs
Just read your message on my phone
It's turning me on

When you say you need me
And you just got to see me
And all you want is me right now
Oh baby just wait a minute
If your in the bed stay in it
I'm about to dive on in
Got to, got to get you closer
I'm about to bring it on over

Put you up in those satin sheets
I bet you don't get no sleep
I'm getting closer
Make a little love to a Motown beat
Catching your groove with me
I'm about to bring it on over

I know that key's under the mat
So girl just stay right where your at
Be right beside you just like that
I want you so bad

Girl let's pick up where we left off
Little more love a lot less talk
Bout to hear my footsteps down your hall
Hang on

When you say you need me
And you just got to see me
And all you want is me right now
Oh baby just wait a minute (just wait a minute)
If your in the bed stay in it (oh baby stay in it)
I'm about to dive on in, got to
Girl I just got to got to get you closer
I'm about to bring it on over

Put you up in those satin sheets
I bet you don't get no sleep
Im getting closer
Make a little love to a Motown beat
Catching your groove with me

Wanna see our shadows on the wall
Wanna see your beautiful body
Ain't nobody gonna stop me
I'm about to bring it on over
Bring it on over
Yeah bring it on over
Bring it on over

When you say you need me
And you just got to see me
And all you want is me right now
Oh baby just wait a minute
