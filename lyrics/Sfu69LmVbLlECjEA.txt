I waited too long to write this down
The startling sensation is fading
The sweet, sweet burn
Of the first drink of the night, underage
And knowing that you're gonna get away with it
You were a good man before you knew it
And i'm not vain enough to think
That i'd have been good for you if i'd stayed
In the current of your life
I was an eyelash in the shipping lanes

Now i'm so scared about mystery
I fear i smell extinction
In the folds of this novocaine age coming on

I miss the smell of mystery
Reverb leaking out of tavern doors
And not knowing
How the sounds were made
So i left home and i faked my i.d.
I fucked every man that i wanted to be
I was so stupid then
Why should mystery give it's life for me?

Baby I'm afraid
But it's not your fault
Maybe i should go
Home alone tonight

Baby I'm afraid
But it's not your fault
Maybe i should go
Home alone tonight

Now I see you in our old home
Where I'm always scared to go
Those thirty garbage miles
Making wet cigarette butts and used tires
To be poor as the anchor that makes us so sure.

Your sandy voice across my brow
You haven't aged a day
Is it because you took a shortcut
That makes people say you're crazy
Is it true?
You're a time traveler you?
Is it true?
You've seen crazy too?
Can it be a comfort
Between us?
Because I never want to know for sure

Baby I'm afraid
But it's not your fault
Maybe i should go
Home alone tonight

Baby I'm afraid
But it's not your fault
Maybe i should go
Home alone tonight

Now i write this in a pale town
Where excitement is a yellow curb
My dream awake leaps through my window
From the highway
You turn my head and set the brake too late
Release the tears of metric tons
The crash. it comes.
And pours down my public face
Behind a reservoir of collarbones
And forms two private lakes
Baby, I'm afraid

Your orbit is so easy
You haven't gained a day
We're two self fulfilling prophecies
Who don't even have each other
Not that we would ever get away with it
