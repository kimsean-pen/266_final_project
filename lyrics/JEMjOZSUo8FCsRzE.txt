What sort of place is this?
How did it get this far?
We'd never hear them say
We'll never become
It's like a dream in a sense
I never saw this far
But I see the fault
It's like it's never enough

So please just say
Where do you go
If nothing can satisfy
I've wasted all this time
I'm finding the road
And tonight the sky
Is burning bright for me

I'm pleading innocence
They'll never see these scars
Just like the world
To try and tear us apart

But I won't forget
I'll see this through
To the end

So please just say
Where do you go
If nothing can satisfy
I've wasted all this time
I'm finding the road
And tonight the sky
Is burning bright for me

Where do you go?
Where do you find your home?
Or satisfy your hunger?

So please just say
Where do you go
If nothing can satisfy
I've wasted all this time
I'm finding the road
And tonight the sky
Is burning bright for me
