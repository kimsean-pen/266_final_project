She's drivin' away with the dim lights on
She's makin' a play, she can't go wrong
She never waits too long
She's winding them down on her clock machine
And she won't give up 'cause she's seventeen
She's a frozen fire, she's my one desire

I don't want to hold her down
Don't want to break her crown
When she says, "Let's go
I like the nightlife, baby"
She says, "I like the nightlife, baby"
She says, "Let's go"

She's laughin' inside, 'cause they can't refuse
She's so beautiful now, she doesn't wear her shoes
She never likes to choose
She's got wonderful eyes and a risqu√© mouth
And when I asked her before, she said she's holdin' out
She's a frozen fire, she's my one desire

And I don't want to hold her down
Don't want to break her crown
When she says, "Let's go
I like the nightlife, baby"
She says, "I like the nightlife, baby"
She says, "Let's go"

"I like the nightlife, baby"
She says, "I like the nightlife, baby"
She says, "Let's go"
