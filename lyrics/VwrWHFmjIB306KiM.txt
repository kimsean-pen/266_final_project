I'm taking down all my enemies
'Cause they're all so fucking useless
A bunch of shit talking drama queens
And they're all filled with excuses

I wanna find me a better scene
Where it's not the same opinion
I'd rather go to a funeral
Than to this high school reunion

April Fool, thought you're falling in love
But now you're sucking on a doorknob that I slammed in your face
Life's a cruel crushing bastard crime
And you're a stupid mother fucker, and you're doing the time

'Cause we're all crazy, you're all crazy now
Well, we're so crazy, you've all gone insane
Loss of control
Loss of control

Hanging out all by myself
At least I make good company
Hey, isn't that old what's his face
That I see walking down the street

I'm gonna hide in the shadows
'Cause I really got nothing to say
We never had anything in common
And I never liked you anyway

April Fool, thought you're falling in love
But now you're sucking on a doorknob that I slammed in your face
Life's a cruel crushing son of a bitch
And you're a stupid mother fucker, serving shit to the pigs

'Cause we're all crazy, you're all crazy now
Well, we're so crazy, you've all gone insane
Loss of control

April Fool, thought you're falling in love
But now you're sucking on a doorknob that I slammed in your face
Life's a cruel crushing bastard crime
And you're a stupid mother fucker, and you're doing the time

'Cause we're all crazy, you're all crazy now
Well, we're so crazy, you've all gone insane
Loss of control
Loss of control
