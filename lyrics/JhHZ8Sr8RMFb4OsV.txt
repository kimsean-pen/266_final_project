Please, Mom, you ground me all the time
I know that I was right all along
And I'm hoping, remember I'm a kid
I know not what I did, just having fun
You couldn't wait, for something new
And yesterday, I thought of you
Left me to think, as if I couldn't walk away
It's too late, I fell through
Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before
Shit, Dad, please, don't kick my ass
I know I've seen you trashed at least one time
Can I blame it on one of my dumb friends?
It's been awhile since I have used that line
You couldn't wait for something new
And yesterday I thought of you
Left me to think, as if I couldn't walk away
It's too late, I fell through
Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before
Alright
Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before
