My male role models, drug dealers and thugs
My father learned how to solve problems with guns
And when I grew up I learned what racism was
And what teachin' it does, and like my teachers would say
"Little black boys have a place in the world
Like hangin' from trees"
Or dead in the street, like I seen on TV
All them boys they killed, they looked just like me
Not like Brandon or Chandler, but Malik and Kareem
I was born with a target, and it stuck to my skin
And I learned in social studies, I was one of them men
Who were locked in the chains, but not locked in the pen
But I'm bigger than that, I'm the beginnin' and end

I'm the sun and the moon
I'm the light and the dark, I am life in the tomb
I'm the pharaoh and slave, gentrifyin' my spirit
It's like a knife in the womb, refuse to act like a parrot
Or to dance like a monkey, see your stance is apparent
That's why I'm here for the money, don't care to cater to Mary
Y'all fetishizin' my spirit, I see your culture's dependent
On what you didn't inherit, won't let my world be attempted
I'm stayin' distant

Who gonna be the reason why I get high?
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over?
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust?
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped?
