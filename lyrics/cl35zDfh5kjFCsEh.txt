Blood is flowing on the ground
Like a river branching red lines
Anguish is all around
Hope yielding to despair

Life is a circumstance
Any minute slips away
God, please look upon us all
Do you give a damn?

Dancing in the air
Spinning leaves in circles giving pleasure to my eyes
Sadden my delight
When the joy is over laying scattered on the ground

Oh! The sun will rise the beginning of creation
Oh! Into the skies on the Winds of Destination
Carry us away...

Secret ark of Solomon
Hidden in the temple wreck...
For the king
Many years and centuries
Till seven knights from the order

Down the tunnels of the past
Learning from the undisclosed...
All the way!
Holding dreams on zealous hands
All those archives
Lost and wasted
Somewhere in the battle fields

Farewell to common world
Templars are watching and guarding the scrolls
Shields of faith the knights behold
All Manuscripts of the sacred laws are there

Dancing in the air
Spinning leaves in circles giving pleasure to my eyes
Arise!

Oh! The sun will rise the beginning of creation
Oh! Into the skies on the Winds of Destination
Carry us away

(Old leaves will be falling)
(Old trees will remain)
(Whirlwind carries you away)
(For tomorrow be the same)
