Deaf, dumb, blind, paralyze, cross into the other side
Won't wear the mask that slips
Your coffin opens and closes and pulls you in and pulls you in

Keep searching for the wrecking ball that's in us all
Rise above all that I am

Keep searching for the wrecking ball that's in us all
Rise above all that I am

Crush your demons
Crush!
I see them falling

Crush your demons
Crush!
I see them falling

Blood red eyes, desensitize, nothing left inside
Won't wear the mask that slips
Your coffin carries the burden that pulls you in that pulls you in

Keep searching for the wrecking ball that's in us all
Rise above all that I am

Keep searching for the wrecking ball that's in us all
Rise above all that I am

I see them falling
I see them falling
Torn between the soul of judgement
Waiting for your life to

You follow blood you follow blood
Against the world
Never ask for this
You follow hate
Not anymore
Never ask for this
Waiting for your life to, to end

Crush your demons
Crush
I see them falling

Crush your demons
Crush
I see them falling
Crush
