Rust on my pickups and blood on the stage
Seeds in the ashtray and coke on a blade
NYC delivers, that's a guarantee
The only thing that keep the day from me

Line at the bathroom, line at the bar
Take it outside, do the rest in the car
Hot candy baby's in a bright light fright
Rock 'n' roll rat race, everybody's uptight, that's right

Ain't your saint, ain't your enemy
I'm a long shadow on the highway
I know this ain't how it's supposed to be
Baby, I ain't hiding

Stayed on the dance floor 'cause you can't find the door
Can't run out 'cause there's always more
Keep on rocking 'cause it's not even four
Turn up the bass until your ears get sore

Ain't your saint, ain't your enemy
I'm a long shadow on the highway
I know this ain't how it's supposed to be
Baby, I ain't hiding

I ain't your saint, ain't your enemy
I'm a long shadow on the highway
I know this ain't how it's supposed to be
Baby, I ain't hiding

Baby, I ain't hiding
Baby, I ain't hiding
Baby, I
Baby, I, I ain't hiding
