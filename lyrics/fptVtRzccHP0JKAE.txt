Do you want it
to be outside
the cool night
the stars gravitate
toward you

do you want it
to be outside
the cool night
with the fog
wraps itself
around you

do you want it
to be outside
the sunshine
where the clouds
take their places
for you

and the wind and snow
and the rain that blows
none of those
would matter much
without you

and as long as its talking with you,
talk of the weather will do

do you want it
to be outside
in the cool night
with the stars gravitate
toward you

do you want it
to be outside
in the sunshine
where the song keeps
itself inside you

and the wind and snow
and the rain that blows
none of those would matter much
without you

nobodys hoping
for better days
noone knows
what to do
youre ok
in your secret ways
noone bothering you
might save time
if i meet you there
but i dont care,
id rather wait for you

and noones home
and the weathers fine
id rather wait for you
and noones home
and the weathers fine
id rather wait for you
