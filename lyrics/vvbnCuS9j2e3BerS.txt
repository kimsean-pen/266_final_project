I lay in the darkest room,
The door is locked, at chains I grasp...
The chill runs through my bones
In panic I grief. Oh please help me die...

The walls close in on my existence

Unreal illusions re-appear
Darkness increases still...
Frozen illusion

I lay in the darkest room
As images appear once more...
The chill runs through my bones
My body is stiff as my soul departs the earth
