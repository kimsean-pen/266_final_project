Take me in your arms
Float with me
Die with me
Smother me with your blood
Bind me with that sun

We stroked the heads of angels
And smiled to clip their wings

This birth of rage
Another book - a bloody page
To turn again
Still, falling tears
Our memories lost
Throughout these years

Take me in your arms
Float with me
Die with me
Smother me with your blood
And blind me with your silence...
