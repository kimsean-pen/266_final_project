My lungs, they hurt and I'm tired to shove
the things I'm thinking too much about
I know they bite the conscience hard
when the music stops and I turn off the lights
waiting for me, waiting close,
ready to get me and I know the cause
I'm watching them dance their ballet and all that I know

is their teeth do hurt when they bite my throat
and it makes nothing easier
closer and closer, they're getting here
I'm waiting for them when I've never wanted
but the snakes, they entered my home
