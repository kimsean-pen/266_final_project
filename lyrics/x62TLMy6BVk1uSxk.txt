How much longer
Will I continue to resort
One dying wish
A tricky topic to distinguish
As I open up the roller gates
You come running up the hotel staircase
It unravels and out comes the panel
Judgemental ridicules and it's
Aggravating my patience yeah
Aggravating sensations
Aggravating my frustration and let me tell ya how
Until they point and bark with aggression
Forced pressure for the dark confession
I could see t brewing it in the mix
My reflex is nonexistent

I'm mostly swing and a miss
Once again I'm slim cut short
Reserved from my confidence
Heavily sunken openly distraught

I'm mostly swing and a miss
Once again I'm slim cut short
Reserved from my confidence
Heavily sunken openly distraught
I admit I've been a cunt
I've thought long and hard bout what needs to be done
Cause it ain't any fun for no one

Aggravating my patience yeah
Aggravating sensations
Aggravating my frustration

Aggravating sensations
Aggravating sensations
Aggravating my patience yeah
