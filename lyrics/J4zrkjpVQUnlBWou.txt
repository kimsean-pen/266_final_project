How does it feel to wonder
How does it feel to know who we are
I cannot find one answer
I cannot find my way back to when my sun died

My sun died
My sun died
My sun died
My sun died

How does it feel to wonder
How does it feel to know who we are
I cannot find no other
I cannot find my way back to when my sun died

My sun died
My sun died
My sun died
My sun died

Now that it falls we live with you
Now that I feel the same with you
Now that it falls we live with you
Now that I found the way there

My sunlight
My sunlight
My sunlight
My sunlight
My sunlight
My sunlight
My sunlight
My sunlight
