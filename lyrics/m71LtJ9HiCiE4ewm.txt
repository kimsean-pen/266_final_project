I woke the other day
And saw my world has changed
The past is over but tomorrow's wishful thinking

I can't hold onto what's been done (woah-oh)
I can't grab onto what's to come (woah-oh)
And I'm just wishing I could stop, but

Life goes on
Come of age
Can't hold on
Turn the page

Time rolls on
Wipe these eyes
Yesterday laughs
Tomorrow cries

Memories are bittersweet
The Good times we can't repeat
Those days are gone and we can never get them back

Now we must move ahead (woah-oh)
Despite our fear and dread (woah-oh)
We're all just wishing we could stop, but

Life goes on
Come of age
Can't hold on
Turn the page

Time rolls on
Wipe your eyes
Yesterday laughs
Tomorrow cries

With all our joys and fears
Wrapped in forgotten years
The past is laughing as today just slips away

Time tears down what we've made (woah-oh)
And sets another stage (woah-oh)
And I'm just wishing we could stop

Life goes on
Come of age
Can't hold on
Turn the page
Time rolls on

Wipe these eyes
Yesterday laughs
Tomorrow cries
Time rolls on
