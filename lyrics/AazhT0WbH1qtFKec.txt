Baby, only the strong would survive
Over mysteries of life
Only fantasy keeps you away
In the lonely fields of
Those broken shields

So keep on kicking, the bomb is ticking
Don't stop, don't be a runaway, go for the fire
Baby, are you tough enough?
Just keep on living and don't start giving
The devil good reasons to get you
In the seasons of heartbreak
Baby, are you tough enough?
Baby, are you tough enough?

Yeah, my skin is a dangerous place
Never trust my smiling face
With a touch I can change all your dreams
And my kiss can wake feelings you can't take

So keep on kicking, the bomb is ticking
Don't stop, don't be a runaway, go for the fire
Baby, are you tough enough?
Just keep on living and don't start giving
The devil good reasons to get you
In the seasons of heartbreak
Baby, are you tough enough?
Baby, are you tough enough?

Baby, are you tough enough?
Baby, are you tough enough?

I will meet you there
'Cause I need you there
Oh, tonight

So keep on kicking, the bomb is ticking
Don't stop, don't be a runaway, go for the fire
Baby, are you tough enough?
Just keep on living and don't start giving
The devil good reasons to get you
In the seasons of heartbreak
Baby, are you tough enough?
Baby, are you tough enough?

Baby, are you tough enough?
Baby, are you tough enough?

So keep on kicking, the bomb is ticking
Don't stop, don't be a runaway, go for the fire
Baby, are you tough enough?
Just keep on living and don't start giving
The devil good reasons to get you
In the seasons of heartbreak
Baby, are you tough enough?
Baby, are you tough enough?

Baby, are you tough enough?
