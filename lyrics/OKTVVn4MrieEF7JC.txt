Reason never seems
To come to guilty men
Things that meant so much
Mean nothing in the end

Their function is dysfunctional
To hide the truth
Distracted by their faith

Ignoring every proof

A bicycle
A garden wall

A mother's call
A love is born

And after all

The sleep that falls on me
In the city there are those that live alone
Twilight brings them from the gloom
Into our homes

And hiding there among
The wreckage left behind

They see things that haunt them

When they close their eyes

Come back if you want to
And remember who you are
'Cause there's nothing here
For you my dear
And everything must pass
When the world doesn't want you
It will never tell you why
You can shut the door
But you can't ignore
The crawl of your decline
Come back(Child come) if you want to
(Child come)
(Child come)
(Child come)
Come back(Child come) if you want to
(Child come)
Come back(Child come)
(Child come)

A bicycle
A garden wall
A mother's call
A love is born
And after all the sleep that falls on me
