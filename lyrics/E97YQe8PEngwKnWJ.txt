Pink, it's my new obsession
Pink, it's not even a question
Pink, on the lips of your lover
(oh)

'Cause Pink is the love you discover
Pink, as the bing on your cherry
Pink, 'cause you are so very
Pink, it's the color of passion

Ah, 'cause today it just goes with the fashion
Pink, it was love at first sight
Yeah, Pink when I turn out the light
And Pink gets me high as a kite
And I think everything is going to be all right

No matter what we do tonight
You could be my flamingo
'Cause pink, it's the new kinda of lingo
Pink - like a deco umbrella

It's pink but you don't ever tell her
Pink, it was love at first sight
And Pink when I turn out the light
Pink gets me high as a kite
And I think everything is going to be all right

No matter what we do tonight
I want to be your lover
I, I wanna wrap you in rubber
And it's pink as the sheets that we lay on

'Cause Pink, it's my favorite crayon
Yeah!
Pink, it was love at first sight
Pink, when I turn out the light
Pink, it's like red but not quite
And I think, everything is going to be all right
No matter what we do tonight
