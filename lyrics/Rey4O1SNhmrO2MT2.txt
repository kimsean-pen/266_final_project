We went to the lake and we sat in the sand
Echoes came over those fresh summer jams
The water was warm from the sun beating down
We waded in slow 'til we couldn't touch the ground
Swimming beneath the power lines
We left our streets for the pines
Down by the bay
The boats are in the harbour
Waiting for clear days
It's just a matter of time
It's just a matter of time
