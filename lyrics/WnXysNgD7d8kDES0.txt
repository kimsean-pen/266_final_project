What were you thinking?
What was going on inside your head?
Tell me were you drinking?
Or just plain insane?
How were you feeling?
With another couple thousand dead
Or were you lying?
Just playing games

Placing your bet
Russian roulette
Well on your way
To ending our days

You'll leave us all behind
Broken with precision
Blind leading the blind
Have it your way
You've left us all behind
Riddled with deception
Pepper us with lime
Have it your way

Was it for your father?
Did you get a little pat on the head?
That's the way to go boy
Clean up his mess

Placing your bet
Russian roulette
Your on your way
To ending our days

You'll leave us all behind
Broken with precision
Blind leading the blind
Have it your way
You've left us all behind
Riddled with deception
Pepper us with lime
Have it your way

Welcome to the new way
The new world order part two
But I'll be damned if they
Would ever die for you
The world is crashing down
All around us, all around you
The world is falling down
Have it your way, we have nothing to say

You'll leave us all behind
Broken with precision
Blind leading the blind
Have it your way
You've left us all behind
Riddled with deception
Pepper us with lime
Have it your way

Bombs, bullets and blood
The things that we don't see
The things that we can't touch
Nightmares are reality
The things that we don't see
On the t.v.

Pledge your allegiance
To the bombs, bullets and blood
Pledge your allegiance
To the bombs, bullets and blood
