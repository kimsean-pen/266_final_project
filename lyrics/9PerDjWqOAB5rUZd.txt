I'm tryna come up with a systematic approach
To love you and let you go
But you're cloudin' up my judgment every time
You give me chills when you look at me like that
I don't know how I feel
Nobody, nobody's deep, deep, deep, deep
Deep, deep, deep

Somebody left me feeling empty
And somebody ripped me at the seams
But you're bringing back all my feelings
You're bringing back all of my feelings
I'm deep divin' into your emotions
And sometimes, I think I might be broke
But you're bringing back all my feelings
You're bringing back all of my feelings
And I fuckin' love, I fuckin' love it

It's becoming less
Less about what I know and more about what I think
I think that I go crazy every time your lips on mine
Oh my fucking God, I wanna change my mind
But oh, you've got it in so deep, deep, deep, deep
Deep, deep, deep

Somebody left me feeling empty
And somebody ripped me at the seams
But you're bringing back all my feelings
You're bringing back all of my feelings
I'm deep divin' into your emotions
And sometimes, I think I might be broke
But you're bringing back all my feelings
You're bringing back all of my feelings
And I fuckin' love, I fuckin' love it

Uh
Yeah, yeah

Shy away from ya, I can't
Put your love down, I can't and I won't
Can't you see it from where you stand?
That you know I love you, know I love you
Shy away from ya, I can't (Shy away)
Put your love down, I can't and I won't
Can't you see it from where you stand? (Shy away)
That you know I love you, know I love you

Ah, ah, ah ah ah
Ah, ooh, ah ah ah
