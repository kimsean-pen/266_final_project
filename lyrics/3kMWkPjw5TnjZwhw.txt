Like a worm, boring through
Cinders and rock and ash - I think I need a broom
To sweep away the day
Cleanse us of the shame we're in - I'm in

Like a stray, with the mange
Worms and lice and matted - I think I need to bathe
To wash away the day
Cleanse us of the palate, rid me of the taste

You keep leading me
You keep driving me
You keep pushing me
Out to pasture to graze

Can't keep strangling
Can't keep ignoring me
Can't keep choking me
Climbing a clocktower

You keep telling us
You keep shoving us
You keep forcing us
Out to pasture to graze

You stopped listening
You stopped listening
You stopped hearing me
So I'm loading my gun

Like a bum, sifting through
Dumpsters and trash and garbage - think I need some food
I've starved away all day
Cleanse us of the hunger we're in - I'm in

Like a snake, sliding through
Sand and dirt and desert - think I need a tomb
To blacken out the day
Vell me from the sunlight, keep me in place

You keep leading me
You keep driving me
You keep pushing me
Out to pasture to graze

Can't keep strangling
Can't keep ignoring me
Can't keep choking me
Climbing a clocktower

You keep telling us
You keep shoving us
You keep forcing us
Out to pasture to graze

You stopped listening
You stopped listening
You stopped hearing me
So I'm loading my gun

It seems to me
There are so many things they don't want to share
Now doesn't that seem strange?
It seems to me
It's all for one but doesn't it seem strange
When the one's for none?
Not you, not me, no one

And doesn't it seem strange that we don't know a thing?
Doesn't it feel the same as the cattle out to graze?
Don't you think its strange that we cant find our way?
Don't you feel the same?

Doesn't it seem strange that we don't know a thing?
Doesn't it feel the same as the cattle out to graze?
Don't you think its strange that we cant find our way?
Don't you feel the same?

You keep leading me
You keep driving me
You keep pushing me
Out to pasture to graze

Can't keep strangling
Can't keep ignoring me
Can't keep choking me
Climbing a clocktower

You keep telling us
You keep shoving us
You keep forcing us
Out to pasture to graze

You stopped listening
You stopped listening
You stopped hearing me
So I'm loading my gun
