Calling for a new beginning
Burn the verses of the past
Fight through the ash
Breathe in the embers

They are the resurrection
The fire will light once again
Inside of you
Blow out a new inferno

Nothing can withstand its energy
The cycle will continue

In beautiful and everlasting synchronicity
Enter equilibrium while remaining
At the centre of the universe
