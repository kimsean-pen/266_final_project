Where did we go?
How could we stray so far away?

Delusional, tell me that we're not the ones to blame

I suggest you walk this lonely road to find redemption and become a hero

Resolution, don't watch the eyes

Never mind the words

A million miles away,
it seems that I don't belong in this place. Is there another way?
I find myself closer to a satellite

Begin drifting, Defy the laws of gravity

Stare at the sun, challenging all reality

The glass door to my soul is shattering

The bridges to my past are collapsing
I feel new energy

This is my quickening

Transcending to a new dimension

A million miles away,
it seems that I don't belong in this place Is there another way?
I find myself closer to a satellite

Float away
It seems that I don't belong in this place

A million miles away,
it seems that I don't belong in this place Is there another way?
I find myself closer to a satellite

A million miles away,
it seems that I don't belong in this place Is there another way?
I find myself closer to a satellite
