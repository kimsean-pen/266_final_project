Out beyond the recon point
Battle weary, nerves now frayed
One step closer to oblivion
Abandoned life the price to pay

The final sacrifice - ushered to the grave
There is no time to run or hide
No chance to pray

Mankind's legacy - past knowledge saved
Glory not given - respect is made

Stranded in no man's land
Water always tastes the same
Trapped within this shell hole
There is no shelter from the steel rain
Dead men again

Still unchallenged
Forging on
No respite
Until this war is won

Relentless barrage never ceasing
Artillery has found its range
Caught within the crossfire
There is no shelter from the steel rain
Dead men again

White-hot shrapnel fills the sky

Advancing ever onwards
Conditioned reflex feel no pain
At the point beyond insane
There is no shelter from the steel rain

There is no shelter from the steel rain
Dead men again
