Close my eyes and swallow
Figure out that I, I'm not blind
Broken eared
Just need to disappear

Close my eyes and swallow
Figure out I need to get up out of here

I know, I know, I know, I know
By the look in your eyes it's time to go
We rub our legs like crickets
Kicking cans and stones
Make it electric, make it electric
Make it electric, make it electric
I've got to know I'm still alive

Tonight, I wanna make it real
Close my eyes, feel it ride up my spine
Radiate out my limbs into air
Make it electric, make it electric
Make it electric, make it electric
I've got to know I'm still alive

Tonight I wanna make it real
Close my eyes, feel it ride up my spine
Radiate out my limbs into air
Make it electric, make it electric
Make it electric, make it electric
I've got to know I'm still alive

Two knuckles gone
Bitten from the thumb
Of the digit meant to keep us satisfied
So raise a glass
To those who finish last
Here's to us because we got all night

Close my eyes and swallow
Figure out that I, I'm not blind
Broken eared
Just need to disappear
