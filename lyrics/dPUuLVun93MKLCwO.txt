I see the way that the sun sets in your face
Our love is to big for us to break
You've got me wishing for the stars in outer space
I'm holding onto this for life and love and for

The possibility, you and me
Let me be

I need to find a way
To put this struggle behind us
Can't spend my life in shame
Making light of these dark days

I see the way that the rain spits in your face
Just falling upon your lips to taste
If I could give to you the stars in outer space
I'm holding onto this for life and love and for

The possibility, you and me
Let me be

I need to find a way
To put this struggle behind us
Can't spend my life in shame
Making light of these dark days

Another time and place
To put this struggle behind us
Can't spend my life in shame
Making light of these dark days

So far away
So far away
Look into your heart
And let time heal this pain
We're not so far away

The possibility, you and me
Let me be

I need to find a way
To put this struggle behind us
Can't spend my life in shame
Making light of these dark days

Another time and place
To put this struggle behind us
Can't spend my life in shame
Making light of these dark days
