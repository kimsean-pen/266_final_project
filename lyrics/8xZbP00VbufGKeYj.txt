I've crawled trought the dessert on my hands and knees
Rehersin my pretty please
Climbed the highest mountain
If I were sorry
Shouted from the top
Swim underwater until my longs exploded
Walk in to the fire
If I were sorry
A have ran a thousand miles
Wouldn't stop until dropped
Wouldn't take a break to breath until I got close enough
And I do it all again
If I really had the chance
But I know deep inside for u its just another
Dance
If I were sorry
I'd give you all the glory
If I were sorry
If I were sorry
It would be a differnt story
If I were sorry
If I were sorry, oh
I'll hold my breath till my face turned blue
I'll rob a bank and a post office too
Swim across the ocean
If I were sorry
I take vow of silence
I wouldn't say a single word
Until you really heard
If I were sorry
I'd run a thousand miles
Wouldn't stop until I dropped
Wouldn't take a break to breath till I got close enough
If I were sorry
I'd give you all the glory
If I were sorry
If I were sorry
I'd would be a different story
If I were sorry, oh
Did you ever realise
that your mistake had a price
Ohw, you threw it all away
Cuz you're the devil in the skies
And would you ever realise
the consequences of your lies
And would you just save the folenteer
or the right to say there nothing
there
If I were sorry
(If I were sorry)
If I were sorry
(If I were sorry)
If I were sorry
I take vow of silence
I wouldn't say a single, word
(If I were sorry)
If I were sorry
I'd be on my hand and knees
Begging pretty please
If I were sorry
But I'm not sorry
No
