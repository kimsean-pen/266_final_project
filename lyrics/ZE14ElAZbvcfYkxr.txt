The light always shines
When I travel around
The stars, the milky way
The moon and the sun

My mind like a ship
Through memories flies
Vast space, distant shores

Dark endless skies

Where are you now?
Lost inside your alien soul
Searching for
The supernova
And the stars
Where are you now?
In another galaxy

Watching me
Longing for the past

The light always shines

When I travel around
The stars, the milky way
The moon and the sun

My mind like a ship
Through memories flies
Vast space, distant shores
Dark endless skies

The screens visualize
Holograms of the moon
The blue of the skies
And pictures of you
As time goes by
Days flow like tears
Clouds blown away
By the solar wind
Where are you now?
Lost inside your alien soul
Searching for
The supernova
And the stars
Where are you now?
In another galaxy
Watching me
Longing for the past
Where are you now?
Lost inside your alien soul
Searching for
The supernova
And the stars
Where are you now?
In another galaxy
Watching me
Longing for the past
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
The light always shines
When I travel around
The stars, the milky way
The moon and the sun
The light always shines
When I travel around
The stars, the milky way
The moon and the sun
Where are you now?
The light always shines
When I travel around
The stars, the milky way
The moon and the sun
Where are you now?
The light always shines
When I travel around
The stars, the milky way
The moon and the sun
