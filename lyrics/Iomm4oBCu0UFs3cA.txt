If they're on you like a tattoo
They're watching every move that you're making
You're blue eyes, were white lies
I thought you were mine for the taking
But you punch my lights out
(But you punch my lights out)

Now you're free to be
The lonely life of the party
Go, you'll see
Let's get one thing straight
You're gonna regret you left me

Never shoulda told you that I fell in love
'Cause you turned me right around
And threw me down and now I can't get up
You'll be sorry, just you wait and see
But let's get one thing straight
You're gonna regret you left me

You puzzle like a jigsaw
You love me, now we don't fit together
I used up my last straw
I thought I would drink you forever
But now you're my last call
(But now you're my last call)

Now you're free to be
The lonely life of the party
Go, you'll see
Let's get one thing straight
You're gonna regret you left me

Never shoulda told you that I fell in love
'Cause you turned me right around
And threw me down and now I can't get up
You'll be sorry, just you wait and see
But let's get one thing straight
You're gonna regret you left me

I know why you set the trap
I know why you dress in black
Flies in your web tonight
(Flies in your web tonight)

I know why you beat the rap
Some day you'll be crawling back, crawling
You'll be crawling back to me, yeah

I never shoulda told you that I fell in love
'Cause you turned me right around
And threw me down and now I can't get up
You'll be sorry just you wait and see
But let's get one thing straight

Never shoulda told you that I fell in love
'Cause you turned me right around
And threw me down and now I can't get up
You'll be sorry just you wait and see
But let's get one thing straight
You're gonna regret you left me

Never shoulda told you that I fell in love
'Cause you turned me right around
And threw me down and now I can't get up
You'll be sorry just you wait and see
But let's get one thing straight
You're gonna regret you left me
