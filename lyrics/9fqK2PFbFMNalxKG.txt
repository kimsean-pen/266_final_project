Why do they come when you're always raining?
Why can't they make a sound?
And seeing the other ones fall back down.

Because you're so far from home,
And you're wailing.

Why do they come when you're always raining?
And why can't they make a sound?
And seeing the other ones fall back down.

Because you're so far from home,
And you're wailing.

You're so far from home,
And you're wailing.

And watched it grow in a small dark corner.
And why can't they make a sound?
And watching the other ones fall back down.

And I've watched you go cold,
And there's no tears left.

And why do they come when the light stops raining?
And where have the colours gone?
And wiping their way across,
And now it's all gone.

Because you're so far from home,
And you're wailing.
