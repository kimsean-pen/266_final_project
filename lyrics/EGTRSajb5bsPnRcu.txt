(Burning...)

A huge fire was burning
And her eyes grew strangely bright
She turned around in her room...
What could she take and still survive the fire?
But then again, there was a window
You know it's an illusion
There is no fire burning... just a soul crying

So cry for me... take a little time... and then stop
It's just something that you cannot see... so stop!
She swings around on the second story...
"I'll get down," she says
Well there is no fire burning... just a soul crying

I will... you know
So I take it to the limit
I will... you know... as I always have
I understand your position...
I withdraw my decision
Well I've got no more information for you

So still there is a fire... that no one sees
She doesn't even see it either...
Or so everyone thinks...
But then again, there was a window
You know it's an illusion...
There is no fire burning... just a soul crying

There's no fire
There is no fire
Well there's no fire burning... just a soul crying...
(It's just a soul... crying...)
