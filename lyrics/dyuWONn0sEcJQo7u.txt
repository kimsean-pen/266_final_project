Trouble going round, trouble going down.
What happened to you little baby, what happened to you little girl?
She said she'd always love you, in you heart shaped world.

Trouble going round, trouble in this town.
What happened to you little baby, what happened to you little girl?
She left you out there crying, in your heart shaped world.

I know what love means too you, I love you to
It hurts to watch her laugh at you, with someone new
Trouble, trouble

(Guitar Solo)

Trouble going round, round, round, round, round,
big cold sunless skies tumbling down, down, down, down.
What happened to you little baby, what happened to you little girl?
She said she'd always love you, in you heart shaped world.

In your heart shaped world
Trouble, trouble, in your heart shaped world
Trouble, trouble, in your heart shaped world, trouble, heart shaped world,
trouble, in your heart shaped world
