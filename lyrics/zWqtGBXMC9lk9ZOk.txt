It's like thunder and lightning
You hurt me without trying
A tempest, you was rising
And no I don't like to be this way
And you're Jekyll and Hyde-ing
Are you real, are you lying
So stop with your crying
I can't handle it now

You tell everyone our love went cold
Going round, spreading the word, it's over
If that's how you feel then you should go
Don't come around saying, "I still want cha."

One minute you say we're a team
Then you're telling me you can't breathe
Well you should set me free
Baby, if you're over me

Yesterday you said I'm the one
But now you say you're done
Stop telling me what I need
Baby, if you're over me

There you go, there I said it
Don't look at me all offended
You played games and it ended
I've got to look out for me
I won't say that it's easy
Oh, I know I hate leaving
But you can't keep deceiving
Does it make you feel good

You tell everyone our love went cold
Going round, spreading the word, it's over
If that's how you feel then you should go
Don't come around saying, "I still want cha."

One minute you say we're a team
Then you're telling me you can't breathe
Well you should set me free
Baby, if you're over me

Yesterday you said I'm the one
But now you say you're done
Stop telling me what I need
Baby, if you're over me

If you're over me
If you're over me
Stop telling me what I need
Baby, if you're over me

How long can a love remain
Time never could heal this pain
I thought I believed in fate
Oh, it's so cruel
No, nothing for us would change
Same story, the same mistake
This heart just wants to break, ohh

One minute you say we're a team
Then you're telling me you can't breathe
Well you should set me free
Baby, if you're over me

Yesterday you said I'm the one
But now you say you're done
Stop telling me what I need
Baby, if you're over me

Just go if it's over
Just go if it's over
Just go if it's over
Baby, if you're over me

Just go if it's over
Just go if it's over
Just go if it's over
Baby, if you're over me
