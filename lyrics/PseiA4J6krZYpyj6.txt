I am just another fool
And I have to keep telling myself that
I am just a hypocrit
And I have to keep calling you one
And I forgot to bite my tongue
As my assumption is the mother of all mistakes
So I assume the role
Open my mouth
And clumsy words escape

So why you, wanna be there?
When you could be here

You are slippin' away

I awake with your replacement
A bottle in my grasp
In an unfamiliar place
'Cause you put me out
The butt of your sick joke
Into this ashtray life
As you come and go
'Cause I forgot to service you
And we broke down
And you can't live with my mistakes
So I assume false grace

Open my arms
And grasp at something true

How are you
How have you been
Girl I miss you
Wanna see you again
Oh why you

Wanna be there?
When you could be here
Girl I'm sliping away

I bring out the worst in you
And you try to let me know
You bring out the worst in me
Anxiety, anxiety
I'm trying to let you go

You say I'm giving you the creeps
So I assume the role
Open my claws
And grasp for your heart

How are you
How have you been
Girl I miss you
Wanna see you again
Into you
Like a mortal stake
So vindictive
Girl I'm sliping away
Violins
Into this ashtray life
Violins
the butt of your sick joke
Violins
I'm trying hard to let you go (Violins)
