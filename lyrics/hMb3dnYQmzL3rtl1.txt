That if you wanna leave a scar you have to cut a little deeper
Oh yeah, oh right, you don't use a knife
You use this motherfucking poison
Like a red spitting cobra
A red spitting cobra

That if you wanna leave a scar you have to cut a little deeper

But if you wanna leave a scar you have to cut a little deeper
Oh yeah, oh right, you don't use a knife
You use this motherfucking poison
Like a red spitting cobra
A red spitting cobra

But if you wanna leave a scar you have to cut a little deeper
Oh yeah, oh right, you don't use a knife
You use this motherfucking poison
Like a red spitting cobra
A red spitting cobra
