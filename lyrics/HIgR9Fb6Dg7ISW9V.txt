It's a blur
The bursting is so loud, so late we feel better
If we had something to fight for
Oh, mother
I act like a boy
Mad at whoever would step on the game that he just drew

If it's where we are, no harm is done yet
If it's where we are, then no harm is done yet
And if this is where you stand, then no harm is done yet
If it's where you stand, then no harm is done

Sure, we slur
Though we wrote it down it's unclear and bitter
Tears and sweat can numb like melted snow
My anger
Once it's figured out will finally matter
I'll pass it on to you, give it a go

If it's where we are, no harm is done yet
If it's where we are, then no harm is done yet
And if this is where you stand, then no harm is done yet
If it's where you stand, then no harm is done

We lose control and we were meant to win
Don't lose the focus, never settling
We could find a way in innocent
Or I could go and be the better man
I can follow
Wanna take the lead but I roam all alone with a heart so hollow
While you were holding the lock and the key to my soul
If it's where we are, then tell me just where I should go

If it's where we are, no harm is done yet
If it's where we are, then no harm is done yet
And if this is where you stand, then no harm is done yet
If it's where you stand, then no harm is done (yet)
