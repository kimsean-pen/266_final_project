May the Good Lord be with ya down every road you roam
And may sunshine and happiness surround you when you're far from home
And may you grow to be proud, dignified, and true
And do unto others as you would have done to you
Be courageous and be brave
And in my heart you'll always stay
Forever young (forever young)
Forever young (forever young)
May good fortune be with you, may your guiding light be strong
Build a stairway to heaven with a prince or vagabond
And may you never love in vain
And in my heart you will remain
Forever young (forever young)
Forever young (forever young)
For ever young
For ever young
Yeah!

And when you fin'lly fly away I'll be hopin' that I served ya well
For all the wisdom of a lifetime no one can ever tell
But whatever road ya choose
I'm right behind you, win or lose
Forever young (forever young)
Forever young (forever young)
For ever young
For ever young
For! For! ever young
For ever young
