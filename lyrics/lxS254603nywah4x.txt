And I know you feel smaller now
Oh in more ways than one
but there are things that you do girl
Oh like nobody else

Like how your hair falls down your back
Oh your eyes crease when you laugh
Oh how you don't walk but you bounce
Oh how you don't cry but you gasp

Let that be a lesson to you
That there's depth where there's distance too
And all that you can do
Is say I'll see you soon
I'll see you soon

and I'm aware of your problems
and all the things that you've done
all that I've know is
that you burn like the sun

Oh how your hair falls down your back
Oh your eyes crease when you laugh
Oh how you don't walk but you bounce
Oh how you don't cry but you gasp

Let that be a lesson to you
That there's depth where there's distance too
And all that you can do
Is say I'll see you soon

Is say I'll see you soon
I'll see you soon
No I'll see you soon
No I'll see you soon

Let that be a lesson to you
That there's depth where there's distance too
And all that you can do
Is say I'll see you soon
Is say I'll see you soon
