You're lookin' at me, nowhere to go,
What they're sayin', I just don't know.
A floor below me, ceiling above,
And I'm in the middle with nobody to love.
Nobody to love, nobody to love, nobody to love, yeah.

Know what they're saying? I just don't know.
A floor below me, a ceiling up above,
And I'm in the middle with nobody to love.
Nobody to love...
