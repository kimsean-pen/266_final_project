Mind that longs for peace
Endless war, it's our mind
What is peace? Sorrow... pain... anger.
The world where those all do not live

Peace doesn't exist if there is no dark
Everyone understand
How should we advance?

People live android-like on here
Why can you feel happiness?
Why can you laugh and try?
This world is made in light and dark

Angry, feels sorry and painful
Still, the world that can be laugh
It is tomorrow for which we hope

We can stay this stardust endless space
It is our universe
We can feel stardust endless space
Sightless, where is a peace?
Endless, what is a peace?

We can stay this stardust endless space
Dive into the freedom
We can feel stardust endless space
Lasting, where is our space?
Trusting, what is our space?

Wave
Why do you live in this world?
What do you live in this world?
Where do you live in this world?
Say, feel, lights out
How do you live in this world?
Wave

Life, peace, space, live
And universe, feel, fly
No, we can stay here

We can stay this stardust endless space
It is our universe
We can feel stardust endless space
Sightless, where is a peace?
Endless, what is a peace?

We can stay this stardust endless space
Dive into the freedom
We can feel stardust endless space
Lasting, where is our space?
Trusting, what is our space?
