I'm determined to find the key
so I open the door
It's a path to the unknown, my mind and something much more
Darkness swallows me as I walk
further away from it all
The tunnels keep on going deep and deeper into these walls, into these walls

Deep and deeper I go, into the mountain doors,
the crystals guide my walk
towards the blue glow
and deeper I go, the earthy wind is raw,
I touch the final door and see the shining hall!

Then I enter the massive hall filled with shimmering stones in the centre of it all I see a crystal clear pond
There's a beast lying on the rocks, I have found him in time
Here I'm meeting my inner fiend who sleeps in the heart of my mind, in the heart of my mind

Deep and deeper I go, into the mountain doors,
the crystals guide my walk
towards the blue glow
and deeper I go, the earthy wind is raw,
I touch the final door and see the shining hall!

The water is clear, he is sleeping - I hear!
I need to get near, I need to get near!
Deep and deeper I go, they drag me dawn below, I fall

Deep and deeper I go, they drag me dawn below
to the depths of the pond
towards their shiny kingdom
And deeper I go, the water streams are cold,
the grip is so strong of the creatures of the pond!
