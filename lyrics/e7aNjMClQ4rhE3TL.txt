The beauty spot was borrowed
Now my sweet knife rusts tomorrow
I'm a confession that is waiting to be heard

Burn your empty rain down on me
Whisper your deathbeat so softly
We bend our knees at the altar of my ego

You drained my heart, you made a spade
But there's still traces of me in your veins
You drained my heart and made a spade
There's still traces of me in your veins

All my lilies' mouths are open
Like they're beggin' for dope and hopin'
But their pedal gently can kick, you won't be back

All the timing that is sorrow
Of all the faces I've acquired
We secure the shadow here, the sun fills face

You drained my heart and made a spade
But there's still traces of me in your veins

And we said, till we die
And we said, till we die

You drained my heart, you made a spade
But there's still traces of me in your veins
You drained my heart, you made a spade
But there's still traces of me in your veins
You drained my heart and made a spade
There's still traces of me in your veins
And we said, till we die
And we said, till we die
