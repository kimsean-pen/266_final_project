We'll ask if we can have six in
If not we'll have to have two
Well you're comin' up our end aren't you?
So I'll get one with you
Oh won't he let us have six in?
Especially not with the food
He coulda just told us no though
He didn't have to be rude

You see her in the green dress?
She talked to me at the bar
Well how come it's already two pound fifty?
We've only gone about a yard
Didn't ya see she were gorgeous?
She was beyond belief
But this lad at the side, drinkin' his Smirnoff Ice
Came and paid for her tropical reef

And I'm sitting going backwards
And I didn't want to leave
I said it's high green mate
Via Hillsborough please

Well how funny was that sketch earlier?
Up near that taxi rank
Oh no you would have missed it
Think it was when you went to the bank
These two lads squaring up, proper shoutin'
'Bout who was next in the queue
The kind of thing that would seem so silly
But not when they've both had a few

Well calm down temper temper
You shouldn't get so annoyed
Well you're actin' like a silly little boy
Oh they wanted to be men
And do some fightin' in the street
Said, no surrender, no chance of retreat!
So hidin' in the taxi

'Cause I didn't want to leave
I said it's high green mate
Via Hillsborough please
Well drunken plots hatched to jump it
Ask around, are ya sure?
Went for it but the red light was showin'
And the red light indicates doors are secured
