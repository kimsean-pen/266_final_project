Oh look at how she listens
She says nothing of what she thinks
She just goes stumbling through her memories
Staring out on to Grey Street.
She thinks, "hey, how did i come to this?
I dream myself a thousand times around the world,
But I can't get out of this place"
Now there's an emptiness inside her
And she'd do anything to fill it in
But all the colors mix together
To grey

And it breaks her heart
And how she wishes it was different
She prays to God most every night
And though she swears He doesn't listen
There's still a hope in her He might
She says I pray
oh, But they fall on deaf ears
Am I supposed to take it on myself
To get out of this place?
Now there's an emptiness inside her
And she'd do anything to fill it in
And though it's red blood bleeding from her now
It feels like cold blue ice in her heart
When all the colors mix together

To grey
And it breaks her heart
there's a stranger, speaks outside her door
Says take what you can from your dreams
Make them real as anything
It will take the work out of the courage
But she says please

There's a crazy man that's creeping outside my door
I live on the corner of Grey Street
And the end of the world
Oh there's an emptiness inside her
And she'd do anything to fill it in.
And though it's red blood bleeding from her now,
it's more like cold blue ice in her heart
She feels like kicking out all the windows
And setting fire to this life.
She could change everything about her
Using colors bold and bright.
But all the colors mix together to grey.
And it breaks her heart.
Oh and it breaks her heart.
To grey.
Yeah!
