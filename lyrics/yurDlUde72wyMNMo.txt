Bleeding you dry from the start
The sum of my parts to give it away
New life in a day, some new Frankenstein

Damned for all time
Cursed by the angel who fell
Who saves me from hell

And who is my God and where is my soul
Too tired to jump, too young to run
Never ending, forever searching
Chasing dreams, the dreams of our heart

Always seeking, always asking
Questions right from the start
Out beyond the new frontier
Playing God without mercy, without fear

Create a beast, made a man without a soul
Is it worth the risk, a war of God and man?
I want to end my life now but I don't know how

Recycled again, a lifetime of pain
The spawn of a man
The devil has planned
Never ending, forever searching

Chasing dreams, the dreams of our heart
Always seeking, always asking
Questions right from the start
Out beyond the new frontier
Playing God without mercy, without fear

Create a beast, made a man without a soul
Is it worth the risk, a war of God and man?
Is it worth the risk, a war of God and man?
Never ending, forever searching

Chasing dreams, the dreams of our heart
Always seeking, always asking
Questions right from the start
Out beyond the new frontier
Playing God without mercy, without fear
Create a beast, made a man without a soul
Is it worth the risk, a war of God and man?
Out beyond the new frontier
Playing God without mercy, without fear
Create a beast, made a man without a soul
Is it worth the risk, a war of God and man?
