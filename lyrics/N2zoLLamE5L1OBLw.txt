We know that it's only human
We know that it's only love
We know that its far too close to home
To see it now

Love all we can before
We learn all we came for
Learn all we can before
The road leads to home

Grace, grace, grace, grace

High road warning
High road warning

Grace, grace, grace, grace

High road warning
High road warning

Laugh, love, live, learn
Laugh, love, live, learn

Eternal I, eternal I, eternal I, I, I, I

My child tells me
We are the fallen men
My child tells me
We are the fallen men

Laugh, love, live, learn
Laugh, love, live, learn

Oh my god

Grace, grace, grace, grace

Never fear love
Never fear love
Never fear love

Never fear love
Never fear love
Never fear love

We know that it's only human
We know that it's only love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Love all we can

I know the way and you know the way
We all fall down if we fear love

Never fear love
Never fear love
Never fear love

Never fear love
Never fear love
Never fear love
