Here comes another problem
All wrapped up in solution
It's ugly as it's strapped on
And twice as hard to get behind
Another sieve-fisted find
Lost, lost again. please, please let me get my hands on it.
Here comes that self-same problem
All stalled on same self again
It's as ugly as the last one and twice as
Far from unwound by this charged head
Standing on this thin base of neck
And now i'm pushing past the red
I said I'm pushing past the red.
Another sieve-fisted find
Lost, lost again
