Sing 2, 3, 4

(Jumble of voices)

Cause all they want is a free ride, all they want is a free ride (x2)

He wouldn't be and I got to again
To sort of seek and I want
And then something and else, and then
Be what I thought and I thought that I don't
But I'm less than awake, and I'm less then awake
He did it back in the city, boy,
He did it once and look what I want...

He won't be what you want him to be, oh no (x2)

All they want is a free ride (He won't be what you want him to be, oh no) (x4)

Don't overdose, overdose (x4)

All they want is a free ride (He won't be what you want him to be, oh no) (x4)

Roller coaster
I play her close
Here's a toast to now
Recognizing the ghost
In the machine
Get in between
The fork and the finger
At the break of an evolution
We're going to linger, forever

Oh no, oh no, oh no, he won't be want you want him, oh no
