Sometimes I sit at home and wonder how it'd be
If he had loved me
Truly loved me yes
I learned a while ago that kind of thing
Never happens for me
And so I go around
And just pretend
Love is not for me
I play the circus clown around my friends
Make them laugh and they won't see
That you never let them see you sweat
Don't want them to think the pain runs deep
Lord knows it's killing me

So I put on my make-up
Put a smile on my face
And if anyone asks me
Everything is okay
I'm laughing cause no one
Knows the joke is on me
Cause I'm dying inside
With my pride and a smile
On my face

On my face

Singing lalalala

Sometimes I sit at home
By the phone hoping he might call me
But he don't call me
But then I realize
Dreams come true aren't for girls like me
Not like me
And so I go around with my head up
Like it ain't no thing
And when the boys around with all my friends
I'm into other things

Cause you never let them see you sweat
Don't want them to think the pain runs deep
Lord knows it's killing me

And, so I put my make up
Put a smile on my face
And if anyone asks me
Everything is okay
I'm laughing cause no one
Knows the joke is on me

But I'm dying inside
With my pride and a smile
On my face
On my face

It's not as easy (thing)
Sometimes it's hard to (face the truth)
It's not the life that I would choose (that I would choose)

But what else can I do?
If he don't love me
If he don't want me
I'm not about to sit around
Let myself go

So I put on my make-up
Put a smile on my face
And if anyone asks me
Everything is okay

I'm laughing cause no one
Knows the joke is on me
Cause I'm dying inside
With my pride and a smile
On my face
On my face
Singing lalalala
Singing lalalala
Singing lalalala...
