A heavy desire for elucidation in this life of obscurant possibilities
Is all we crave
The reason behind all of this
The reason for all of the pain and misery
Are we illuminated into a brighter
dimension of ecstasy and acknowledgement
Are we conscious of our previous beings
Let there be light of the experience
The eternal endlessness of absolute nothingness
Is what I fear the most, what I fear the most

Humankind longs for a simple purpose
We as a species stand just as
corrupt as the confusion we are born into
A sentience of comfortlessness, unanswered questioning
Misery from demoralization
We have no choice but to suffocate in the
ambiguity until we are met with cessation
Guide me to tranquility
Let me find acceptance in the end for desired peace

While I'm here to walk this earth
The human experience is an overwhelming blessing
And a curse the weight of the world
Has shattered my lucidity
I am lost begging for guidance
The weight of the world has shattered me

Humankind longs for a simple purpose
We as a species stand just as
corrupt as the confusion we are born into
A sentience of comfortlessness, unanswered questioning
Misery from demoralization
We have no choice but to suffocate in the
ambiguity until we are met with cessation
Guide me to tranquility
Let me find acceptance in the end for desired peace

I am lost begging for guidance
The weight of the world has shattered me
The weight of the world has shattered me
I am lost begging for guidance
