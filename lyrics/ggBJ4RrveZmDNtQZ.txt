Counting back from one
To the day I come
To meet you in your body
At a show my band was playing

Now it's April 6th
First one that you'll miss
'Cause you're off with all the cancers
You were young but you've got the answers
To the questions that your parents pointed to their God

Starting to count up to two
Another year of missing you

When the dust clears
Where's my body?
When the dust clears
Where's my body?

When the dust clears
Where's my body?
When the dust clears
Where's my body?

That one night we fought
About the little stuff
We went to Dunkin' Donuts
And you got the blueberry glazed one
And I laughed 'cause you knew it was the worst one of the dozen

Starting to count up from ten
Aging in "Remember when"

When the dust clears
Where's my body?
When the dust clears
Where's my body?

When the dust clears
Where's my body?
When the dust clears
Where's my body?

I'm with someone new
And I know that you would love her if you met her
You would love her if you met her
You would love her if you met her
You would love her if you met her
