Sore and leaning towards the other side
An ordinary mouthy talk
As the ego is burning out we find unordinary gold
I love the way it goes
Let us cease the quarrel

I love the way it goes
Let's just say hello
Let's just say hello again
Hello, hello again

Sore and leaning towards the other side
An ordinary mouthy talk
As the ego is burning out we find unordinary gold

I love the way it goes
Let us cease the quarrel
I love the way it goes
Let's just say hello
Let's just say hello again
And again

I love the way it goes
Let us cease the quarrel
I love the way it goes
Let's just say hello
Let's just say hello again
Hello, hello again
