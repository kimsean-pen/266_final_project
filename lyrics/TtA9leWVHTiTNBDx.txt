Back from the window
Everything's subtle
Temporary sanctuary

Look through the window
Everything's subtle
Tailored to fit, but nothing's that simple

Gold, you will always come to me
With the power of deception
Gold won't ever comfort me
The color of deception
The color of deception

Move closer
Subterfuge
Illusion's there for all to see
There's no one left to rescue me
Glass and stone, it cuts like a knife
And gold won't ever comfort me

Gold, you will always come to me
With the power of deception
Gold won't ever comfort me
The color of deception
The color of deception
