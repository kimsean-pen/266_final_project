Seems to be a misunderstanding
Bout who you belong to
I'm tired of he saying, she saying

I don't know where he came from
But he better go back where he's been
Cause I don't want my heart broken
Don't wanna commit no sin

Cause I'm so tired
Oh, you set my soul on fire
I'm so tired
Well, you set my soul on fire

Are you my woman, tell me so
Are you my woman, tell me so
Are you my woman, tell me so
Are you my woman, let me go

Just get on down

Don't you know that
I'll never be the same, no
Cause you know my life
Is in your name

Girl, I really, really
Hate to lose you
Ah, just got to keep on moving

Cause I'm so tired
Oh, you set my soul on fire
I'm so tired
Well, you set my soul on fire

Are you my woman, tell me so
Are you my woman, tell me so
