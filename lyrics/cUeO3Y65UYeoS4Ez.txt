You said boy stop running to the devil
Baby you know it's a trap
Yeah you're a fighter jet waiting for the dogs
Dogs to attack, I'm sorry, girl

If I'm not the model man that you wanted I admit
But you should learn right now
That we can drive, drive like the wind

'Cause I'm a... Yeah I'm a kid
Yeah I'm a kid
Kid
Yeah I'm a kid

You said girl stop playing there's a reason
Why I'm never getting down
But I'm a German I'm finding baby
I'm the only king of the sound

So you can chase me baby while I'm
Running through the desert in the wind
But I can promise you honey
That it's hard, hard to forget

'Cause I'm a... Yeah I'm a kid
Yeah I'm a kid
Kid
Yeah I'm a kid

And that was all you used to say
I don't wanna die on a Sunday
And yeah I'm sorry if I was away
And yeah there's nothing for me here lately

And that was all you used to do
Driving through hell in the summer
You said I'm sorry as you walk away
You said there's nothing for you here lately

And though nothing really matters, no
You said there's nothing for you here lately
And though nothing really matters, no
You said there's nothing for you here lately

You said there's nothing for you here lately
You said there's nothing for you here burnin'
