My walls are crashing down
And I can feel the light of day
The sun is shining down on me (down on me)
I fought through all the doubt
I walked through fire for a flame
It's burning more than yesterday (yesterday)

Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Bold as love
We're bold as love, love
Can't get enough
We're bold as love, love

I'm standing at the top
You thought you've got the best of me
But there was so much more to me (more to me)
I'm never gonna stop
'Cause nothing good comes easely
I picked up every piece of me (piece of me)

Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Bold as love
We're bold as love, love
Can't get enough
We're bold as love, love

Love, love
Love, love
Love, love
Love, love
Love, love
Love, love
Love, love
Love, love

My walls are crashing down
And I can feel the light of day
The sun is shining down on me

Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Bold as love
We're bold as love, love
Can't get enough
We're bold as love, love
Love, love
Love, love
Love, love
Love, love
Love, love
Love, love
Love, love
Love, love
