I see it every day
Everywhere I look they say
Another life has been taken away
It makes my stomach turn
But livin' here you gotta learn
Get used to it, it's reality

Say your prayers
Hope it won't happen to you
Mind your business
Do what you gotta do

Don't look for trouble
Sometimes trouble finds you
And what can you do
What can I do?

One on one fights don't exist
Fist fights are extinct
Nowadays people don't seem to think
They can't see
How easy it is to set a soul free
That decision is not theirs to make

Say your prayers
Hope it won't happen to you
Mind your business
Do what you gotta do

Don't look for trouble
Sometimes trouble finds you
And what can you do
What can I do?

Now you see what I mean
Protecting my family and me
What can I do?

It makes my stomach turn
Livin' here you gotta learn
You gotta fight back
When someone tries to take your life from you
