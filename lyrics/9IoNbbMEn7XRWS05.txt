Now this is the final resistance

In desperate hope
With tear-dimmed eyes
With wrath-torn minds
We took up arms one more time

Uxellodunon
The last stand
The freedom manifesto

We will never forget
The things we've seen
The deaths we died
The tears we cried
We will never regret
We defied
We will raise
Our arm's stubs in pride
We will never perish

This was the final resistance
This was the final revolt

Our cut off hands
Proclaimed grandeur
Land can be taken
But dignity's impregnable

Uxellodunon
Fortress of free men
Shining beacon of indomitability

Bearing witness of freedom
Bearing witness of our names

'Cause we will never forget
The things we've seen
The deaths we died
The tears we cried
We will never regret
We defied
We will raise
Our arm's stubs in pride
We will never perish

(Immi uiros rios toutias rii)

Out from the ashes
Out from the graves
The offspring of Antumnos
Will arise to life again

Uxellodunon
The last stand
The freedom manifesto
We will never forget
The things we've seen
The deaths we died
The tears we cried
We will never regret
We defied
We will raise
Our arm's stubs in pride
We will never perish
