I like staying with my Uncle Dave
And I like playing with his great dane
But I don't fit
I feel alien and strange
Kinda outta range

I like riding in my Uncle's car
Down to the beach where the pretty girls all parade
And movie stars and paparazzi play
The Charles Atlas kicking sand in the face game

And I sit in the canyon with my back to the sea
There's a blood red dragon on a field of green
Calling me back
Back to the Black Hills again
(Ooh, ooh, Billy come home)

Billy is searching for his native land
Flicking through the stations with the dial in his head
Picking up (background: static)
And a male voice choir on the short wave band

Billy taps out Jim's number on the phone
Sits shaking as he waits for Jim's answering tone
Come on my friend, speak to me please
The land of my fathers is calling to me

And I sit in the canyon with my back to the sea
There's a blood red dragon on a field of green
Calling me back
Back to the Black Hills again
(Ooh, ooh) Billy come home
Come on home

He sits in the canyon with his back to the sea
Sees a blood red dragon on a field of green
He hears a male voice choir singing
Billy come home
(Billy, Billy, come home)
Come on home

[Californian Weirdo:] "I don't like fish."
[Californian Weirdo:] "I don't like fish."

[Jim:] "You are listening to KAOS here in Los Angeles."
[Californian Weirdo:] "I don't like fish."
[Jim:] "Yes, we've established that.
Ah! Do you have a request?"
[Californian Weirdo:] "Shell fish, guppy
Shrimp and crab and lobster, flounder
I hate fish, but I think most of all
I hate fresh fish like trout
I hate fresh trout
My least-hated, favourite fish would be sole
That way you don't have to see the eyes
Sole has no eyes."
[Jim:] "Oh no!"
[Woman:] "I'd like to be home with my monkey and my dog."
[Jim:] "Thank you."
[Woman:] "I'd like to be home with my monkey and my dog
I'd like to be home with my monkey and my dog
I'd like to be home with my monkey and my dog
I'd like to be home with my monkey..."
[Jim:] "I don't care. Shut up. Play the record."
