I remember you've forgotten to remember
I wonder why
Baby it was just a (one way ticket to love)
Ticket to love, mmm (one way ticket)

You were lonely without a friends
That was when our romance began
Baby it was just a, just a, yeah (one way ticket to love)
Ticket to love, uuh (one way ticket)

Like the dew on the mountain
Like the foam way out on the sea
Like the bubbles on the fountain
You're gone forever from me, yeah

I loved you kindly, I loved you so blind
But I loved you honest and I loved you true
But maybe baby it was just a, a one way, yeah (one way ticket to love)
Ticket to love, uh (one way ticket)

Like the dew on the mountain
Like the foam way out out on the sea
Like the bubbles on the fountain
You're gone forever from me, baby don't do it

I loved you kindly, but I loved you so blind
But I loved you honest and everybody knows I loved you true
Maybe baby, maybe it was just a (one way ticket to love)
Grab about, release this (one way ticket)
Yeah (one way ticket to love, oh oh oh oh, one way ticket to love)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (oh, one way ticket to love)
Oh (oh oh oh oh)
