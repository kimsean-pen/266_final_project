What do you know about sacrifice?
Blood, sweat, tears
Spill my guts for you to see
Blood, sweat, tears
What more could you want from me?

Do you, understand the feeling
Giving, everything to something
I gave it all, gave it all to this
I don't take a thing for granted
You won't shake me where I'm standing
I gave it all, gave it all to this

Crawling on my knees
Disregard my needs
You tried to carve your name in me
Dug out of my grave
One less soul to save
This is how it has to be

Blood, sweat, tears
Spill my guts for you to see
Blood, sweat, tears
What more could you want from me?

Nothing in this life comes easy
Pressure tries to break me down
I refuse to let this happen to me
Now you understand the feeling
Show me you can break the ceiling
This is the price you have to pay

I won't sell myself
For a cheap reward
No matter what they say I had to throw it away
Show I had no fear
To make it to this day

Blood, sweat, tears
Spill my guts for you to see
Blood, sweat, tears
What more could you want from me?
Blood, sweat, tears
Spill my guts for you to see
Victimized, torn apart by the hands of time
Wish that you could see
I put my life on the line
Victimized, torn apart by the hands of time
Wish that you could see I put my life on the line for this
I'll show you what I know about sacrifice

Sacrifice, yeah

Time waits for no one
But I earned my place
Time waits for no one
But I earned my place

Sacrifice
Blood, sweat, tears
Spill my guts for you to see
Blood, sweat, tears
What more could you want from me?
