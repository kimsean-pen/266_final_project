We've come to replace your clock's old stubborn hands
We are the answer to why
They never had a chance
It was not so long ago
That the world was mostly slow
The age of iron, steam and speed
Turned a stroll to a stampede
But we've come to increase time in between ticks
And there is romance in the slow dances
Because they're fertile in hush
Futile in haste
These are your nerves
This is how they taste

Well I can't count how many times I've been outdone by nihilism
Joined the march that splits an open heart into a schism
I cower at the thought of other people's expectations and yet still
Hand over mine to them

Travel where you are
Tourism is sin, these are the ruins we left behind
You can't take pictures of them
If what they say is true,
Then you become what you chew, iIf it decays spit it out
Affectation is a drought
That you wait through when you hate everything that you do
You wanna live outside the groove,
then fine, but it's there like a flower
Blooming in your ear
Open up your mouths
Pollinate your peers

Nothing reminds the mind of power
Like the cheap odor of plastic leaking fumes
We crave, consume, the rush it feels fantastic
But like power turns to mold
Like a junkie going cold, I need the fix
Of a little tenderness
