Couple of lovebirds kissing on the corner
Couldn't help but remind me of you
Halfway through dialing your number
You know it's true, I wanted to

Took a stroll down sunset boulevard
Heard an old man singing the blues
Halfway through writing you a love song
You know it's true, I wanted to

Sunrise on the east side
Want to wake up next to you
But I'm dreaming on the west side
Trying to find my way to you

Tell me you want me
Speechless and I'm shaking
Tell me you need me
You better believe me when I say that you are my weakness
You are my weakness and you get me every time

Tired of flipping through the channels on the tv
Nothing on could shake you out of my mind
So I grab my coat and I'm out the door
I'm just killing time til you're by my side
Too many places get in the way of bringing you back into view

Sunrise on the east side
Want to wake up next to you
But I'm dreaming on the west side
Trying to find my way to you

Tell me you want me
Speechless and I'm shaking
Tell me you need me
You better believe me when I say that you are my weakness
You are my weakness and you get me every time

Caught in the middle of the storm, you are my shelter
When all that I see is black and white, you are the color
Nothing can stop me, no distance too great to cover
All I want to hear you say

Tell me you want me
Speechless and I'm shaking
Tell me you need me
You better believe me when I say that you are my weakness
You are my weakness
You are my weakness
Yes, you are my weakness and you get me every time
