Well, long ago
Certain place, certain time
You touched my hand all the way
All the way down to Emmeline
But if our paths never cross
Well, you know I'm sorry but

If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
The rainbow's edge

So it's hard to find
Someone with that kind of intensity
You touched my hand, I played it cool
And you reached out your hand to me

But if our paths never cross
Well, no I'm not sorry but

If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
The rainbow's end

So long ago
It's a certain time, it's a certain place
You touched my hand and you smiled
All the way back, you held out your hand

But I hope, and if I pray
Ooh, it might work out someday

If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again

If I live to see the seven wonders (if I live to see the seven wonders)
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end (I'll make a path there)
I'll never live to match the beauty again (I'll never live to see that beauty, that beauty
That same, same beauty again)

If I live to see the seven wonders (if I live to see the)
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again (Well if I hope and I pray, well)
(Maybe it might work out someday)

If I live to see the seven wonders (if I live to see the seven wonders)
