Your life was a shooting star
That burned out way too fast
And all the memories of
A dream that's built to last
Don't wanna wait, wanna wait, wanna wait for my next panic attack, no
Don't wanna wait, wanna wait, wanna wait for my next crash

It's a beautiful pain

It's a beautiful pain
When I remember the good times
When I remember the good
It's a beautiful pain
It's a beautiful pain
When I let go of the heartache
When I let go of your heart
All the times that I keep holding on to

Even though you're gone
And the nights that I keep holding back the tears
I hope you found what you're looking for

I pray that you're happy now
You're never looking back
Rest with the angels now
The heavens gains your laugh

Don't wanna wait, wanna wait, wanna wait 'cause you're never coming back, no
Don't wanna wait, wanna wait, wanna wait for the last dance

It's a beautiful pain

It's a beautiful pain
When I remember the good times
When I remember the good
It's a beautiful pain
It's a beautiful pain
When I let go of the heartache
When I let go of your heart
All the times that I keep holding on to

Even though you're gone
And the nights that I keep holding back the tears
I hope you found what you're looking for

Don't say goodbye tonight
Don't say goodbye tonight
Don't say goodbye tonight and leave forever
Don't say goodbye tonight

Don't say goodbye tonight
Don't say goodbye tonight and leave forever

It's a beautiful pain

It's a beautiful pain
When I remember the good times
When I remember the good
It's a beautiful pain
It's a beautiful pain
When I let go of the heartache
When I let go of your heart
All the times that I keep holding on to
Even though you're gone
And the nights that I keep holding back the tears
I hope you found what you're looking for
I hope you found what you're looking for
