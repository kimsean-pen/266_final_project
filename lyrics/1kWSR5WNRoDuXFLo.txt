You're the only one who made it through the fire, burning fire
You're the only one who walked the water and made it to the other side
You're the one who took away the feelin' of falling
Only one who see's the sun

You know I'm calling
You're the one who took me by the hand showed me how to fly

And I feel so safe that I'm up in your arms
Nothing can touch when I'm right where you are
You busted through the doors, you came up through the floor
Just in the nick of time to safe me

Ah, my heart never had a hero, oh, oh
Ah, my heart never had a hero, oh, oh
When there was no one else, you saved me from myself
Almost gave up on myself 'til you rescued me
Ah, my heart never had a hero, a hero, a hero
Never had a hero, a hero

Faster than the speed of light
You come around and kill my lonely
Better then the average man
You beat the odds, you so incredible

Oh, you are never met someone so strong
Never breaks down, never thought that I belong until you came around
Nothing in this world is like the feeling
Like it when you hold, hold me, hold me

And I feel so safe that I'm up in your arms
Nothing can touch when I'm right where you are
You busted through the doors, you came up through the floor
Just in the nick of time to safe me

Ah, my heart never had a hero, oh, oh
Ah, my heart never had a hero, oh, oh
When there was no one else, you saved me from myself
Almost gave up on myself til you rescued me
Ah, my heart heart never had a hero, a hero
A hero, a hero, a hero, a hero, a hero, a hero
