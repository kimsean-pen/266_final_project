Sunday morning, I forgot my prayer
I should have been happy, I still be there
Something could have come and taken me away
But the mainman felt Sly should be here another day

That's why I got to be thankful yeah, yeah
I gotta be thoughfful
Ah ha thankful, you gotta be
thoughtful

From my ankle to the top of my head
I've taken my chances hah, I could have been dead
I started climbing from the bottom oh yeah
All the way to the top ah huh
Before I knew it-I was up there
You believe it or not

Thankful thoughfful

Oh something gets me, hah, put my head on tight
Because I know the future everything'll be all right
Until then I'll kick back and let the light shine
Remember all yours coulda been all mine

That's why you ought to be thankful
Hah, hah, you ought to be thoughfful

Middle of stream, hah, I had to change my stroke
I say I put it on the good foot And it ain't no joke
They said I was dyin' I didn't want to go
I kept on feelin' I had to live some more

I had somethin' to tell y'all
To be thankful you oughta be thoughfful

Still rectifying, straightening things out
I know what a good feelin' you're never in doubt
Sometimes I'm by myself- feelin' alone
I just look around and check it out And then it's all gone

I'm still happy to be here
Thankful you oughta be thoughfful
Count your blessings

My Momma gave me a song And said Son sang
Record thankful and thoughfful, be such a nice thang
People got to be reminded where it's really at
Make your Daddy happy Momma likes it like that

You know I know you know I know
I'm thankful you know I'm thoughfful
