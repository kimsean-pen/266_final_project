Water, water is for washing, Vino Tinto is for drinking
I hate when you get too high sometimes, and forget about existing
All the simple silhouettes in here, make me nervous in my insides
Take my outsides for a ride, any shape that you can twist them into tonight

Water, water is a privilege, just like kids who go to college
There's a ring around your mouth now, where you used to whisper knowledge
I miss all the things about you, when you're dreaming of an outlet
Take me with you when you trip next, it's so beautiful to see you when no one's watching,

You're just a heart to hold, you're easy to impress
I want to care much more, but I'm feeling less awake
You're just a heart to break, easy to manipulate
I want to care much more, but I'm feeling less and less
I want to care much more, but I'm feeling less and less
I want to care much more, but I'm feeling less and less

Water, water is for washing
But I'm feeling less and less
Water, water is for washing
But I'm feeling less and less
