The night's alive with wind and fire
We telegraph our heart's desire
Through the night with our eyes

Wheels are turning fast and hard
Hearts are burnin' on the Boulevard
Hear them pound, young and proud
It's the American Heartbeat

Chart the stars, head out for the action
Hit the streets and find some satisfaction

It's the American Heartbeat
The American Heartbeat
It's the American Heartbeat
Oh, the American Heartbeat

The stage is set, the roles are chosen
The lights grow hot as the midnight's closin'
In at last, it comes so fast

Poundin' harder as the midnight's strikin'
It hits us like a bolt of lightning
Deeper down
It's the sound of the American Heartbeat

Chart the stars, head out for the action
Hit the streets and find some satisfaction

It's the American Heartbeat, fast and loud
The American Heartbeat, young and proud
American Heartbeat
Oh, the American Heartbeat

It's the American Heartbeat
American Heartbeat
American Heartbeat, American
It's the American Heartbeat
Oh, the American Heartbeat

American Heartbeat
It's the American Heartbeat
The American Heartbeat
Oh, the American Heartbeat

It's the American Heartbeat
American Heartbeat
American Heartbeat, American
It's the American Heartbeat
Oh, the American Heartbeat

The American Heartbeat
American Heartbeat
It's the American Heartbeat, American
The American Heartbeat
Oh, the American Heartbeat

The American Heartbeat
American Heartbeat
American Heartbeat
