Your face is like the sun
Sinking in to the the ocean
Your face is like watching flowers
Growing in fast motion

All your kisses are swallowed
Brightened mornings and hollows
My vines and tree knots will come unwound
Baby you are my sunshine
My sunshine
Please don't take my sunshine away

The grounded fireflies are little stars that are dying
Returning to the earth I can hear the crying
Like Christmas bulbs that I swallowed
Slept in a tree that's gone hollow
And never a brittle winter time
Baby you are my sunshine
My sunshine
Please don't take my sunshine away

Sunshine
My sunshine
Please don't take my sunshine away
