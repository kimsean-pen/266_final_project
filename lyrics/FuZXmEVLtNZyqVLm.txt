Who would have known that I could conquer your heart
By reflecting in someone else?
And who would have thought that I could comfort your heart
When I can't recognize myself?

I know how she speaks and how she moves
When she doesn't know what to say
'Cause her emotions carry her away
I watch her from my rooftop every night

And when I go to sleep she holds my head in her arms
And she makes sure that nothing will tear us apart
And then I steal a lock of her hair and open up my eyes

I will follow you, you will be my main direction
I study you until I will get your
Everything you do is a gem in my collection
I follow you until I will get your perfection

Who would have known that after hunting you down
She would leave all the bones for me?
And who would have thought that she could leave someone like you?
She left a part of herself

You know how I speak, how I try to imitate the way
She lay her head on your shoulder
When you've got nothing more to say
Down to every detail, I won't miss a day

'Cause I know all her lines, her favorite things
And how her restless mind keeps her up in the night
Until the light will come, I'll stand here trying to catch her eyes

I will follow you, you will be my main direction
I study you until I will get your
Everything you do is a gem in my collection
I follow you until I will get your perfection, you're perfection

Every step I follow you in the wrong direction
I study you until I will get your perfection
Everything you do is put into my collection
I follow you until I will get your perfection

Who would have known that I could conquer your heart?
And who would have thought that I could comfort your heart?

I will follow you, you will be my main direction
I study you until I will get your
Everything you do is a gem in my collection
I follow you until I will get your perfection, you are perfection

You're perfection
