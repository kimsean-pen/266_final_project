Said a stranger on a train

I fixed him with an ice cold stare
And said "I've been havin' those dreams again"

In one dream there's this girl I know
And we dance every wakin' breath

And in the other they've thrown me in a cell
And they're tryin' me for her death

I'm only young and young in love,
As I hold that girl today

But I'm old and tired and in the cell
And I've nigh on withered away

Y'see my babe has gone away too long
I'm chokin' back the tears

Disheveled star in a burnt out bar
I'm talkin' in my drink

She promised me the world and more
How could she do this to me?

And now mine's tumblin' down around
But at least my eyes can see
And those stars in the sky are for me

So as this fagged-out tinsel town
Waves so-long to the sun

I lay here calmly on my bed,
And the trigger of my gun

Should that no good woman show up,
Dancin' from a dream

I'll squeeze it twice,
And not think twice,
And relish every scream...
