At the gates of paradise
Waiting for our names to call from above
There's an angel inside of us
If you do you might die
It's just that I'll be better this time around

You can do anything you want to fucking do
The rules were made to be disbanded by the truth
Did no one tell you to let go of the reins?
Did no one tell you they manipulate?

Send out the press, tell them have him
But nothing feasts like a savage
An honest casualty
(Before the mass is made)
This is what you get when you don't break the habit
We've been the selfish abandoned
What good would that really be?

At the gates of paradise
Waiting for our names to call from above
There's an angel inside of us
If you do you might die
It's just that I'll be better this time around

You can do anything you want to fucking do
The rules were made to be disbanded by the truth
Did no one tell you to let go of the reins?
Did no one tell you they manipulate?

Safe to say we'll never know
How would it end if we watch it go?
Are we better off on our own?

At the gates of paradise
Waiting for our names to call from above
There's an angel inside of us
If you do you might die
It's just that I'll be better this time around

Cannot breathe, cannot see around you every night
It's too late for us all, we're not long for this world
We're digging deeper like a parasite
They say to wake up, are we still alive?

You're only listening because no one's got anything better to say
We're still singing, "Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me"
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

Hate to say we're biding our time
Are you past the point of no return?
Do your symptoms leave you satisfied?
We've got demons buried deep inside

We've got everyone to follow
But there's no one left to walk with
The shallow path of honesty
Residing in our promise
And this will haunt us
Always waking from the truth, we lie in mourning

Safe to say we'll never know
How it would've been if it was to go the other way
I like to say we're better off on our own
Safe to say we'll never know
How it would've been if it was to go the other way
I like to say we're better off on our own
Safe to say we'll never know
How it would've been if it was to go the other way
I like to say we're better off on our own
Safe to say we'll never know
How it would've been if it was to go the other way
I like to say we're better off on our own
