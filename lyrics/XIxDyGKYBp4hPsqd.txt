How long can I survive with this mentality

Trials and tribulations, I'm facing in this age of information
I hate this shit, 'cause niggas hit my phone when they want some shit
Bitches hit my phone when they want some dick
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
You call it running, I call it escaping
Start a new life in a foreign location
Similar to my niggas ducking cases
Can't take the possible time that it faces

My dad died, he got shot cause his friend set him up
And I didn't go to his funeral
And sometimes when I'm in my room
I get mad at my mom when she mean to me
And she say, and she say, clean up, I say

Nigga play me, never
Give up my chain, never
Give up my pride, never
Show my pain, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never
Nigga play me, never
Give up my chain, never
Give up my pride, never
Show 'em my pain, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never
