This is how you hold
It's how you hold
It's how you hold
This is how you hold
It's how you hold
It's how you hold

This is where the night pulls you in
Nothing like old times, when we were friends
And this, this is where the dark calls
And severing sends me out again

I've got nothing on you
Say it's so, still left to lose
I've got nothing on you
Say it's so, still left to lose

This is where you ride and save me up
Nothing I could do to get enough
And this, this is where the dark falls
And both eyes are left to loath

I've got nothing on you
Say it's so, still left to lose
I've got nothing on you
Say it's so, still left to lose

But I won't call on you, my friend
I won't call on you, I can't
But I won't call on you, my friend
I won't call on you, I can't

I've got nothing on you
Say it's so, still left to lose
I've got nothing on you
Say it's so, still left to lose

I've got nothing on you
YOU WERE ALL I'VE HAD TO LOSE
I've got nothing on you
YOU WERE ALL I'VE HAD TO LOSE
