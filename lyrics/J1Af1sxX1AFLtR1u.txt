There was this look in your eyes
Like fire burning to take flight
A distant call from the sky
Beckoning you to flee the night

But I cannot fathom why
You would ever leave my side
Forever wondering how it died
And I can't shake it
With your face

Still haunting me

Your face
Still haunting me

I never wanted it to end how it did
Another lover now crossed off
Off the list

But our time was running out
And our dreams they pulled us down
To another place where you were free
How can this be
With your face

Still haunting me

Your face
Still haunting me

Your face
Still haunting me

Your face
Is still haunting me

It's gone too far tonight
Let's bring our love back to the light
Where it once burned so bright
How can I let this die?
With your face

Still haunting me

Your face
Still haunting me

Your face
Still haunting me

Your face
Still haunting me

Your face
Is still haunting me

Is still haunting me
Is still haunting me

(Still haunting me)
(Still haunting me) see less
