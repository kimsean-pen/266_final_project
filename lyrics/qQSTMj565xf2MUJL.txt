And every single year
I'm drowning in my tears
I'm drowning in my tears again
I can't seem to forget the pain I seem to give
The pain I seem to give my friend
And every single year
I'm drowning in my tears
I'm drowning in my tears again
I can't seem to forget the pain I seem to give
The pain I seem to give my friend

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

And every single year
I'm drowning in my tears
I'm drowning in my tears again
I can't seem to forget the pain I seem to give
The pain I seem to give my friend

And every single year
I'm drowning in my tears
I'm drowning in my tears again
I can't seem to forget the pain I seem to give
The pain I seem to give my friend

And every single year
I'm drowning in my tears
I'm drowning in my tears again
I can't seem to forget the pain I seem to give
The pain I seem to give my friend
Woah oh
