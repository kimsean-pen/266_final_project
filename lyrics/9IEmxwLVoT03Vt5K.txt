It's that ancient love
That you won't outgrow
It's the fee you pay
It's the debt you owe
Is that subtle way
That you throw me down
I am inches above
The dust on the ground

I await your call
I await your crown
Lets change our roads
And chase them all around
Is that such a way
You throw me down
I am inches above
The dust on the ground

And all is quiet
All is quiet now
And all is silent
All is silent now
Now I don't hide it
I don't hide it now

It's that ancient love
That just moves along
And there's an itch so slight
Even when you're gone
Well I met you right
But I kept your wrong
And I must wait untill I've found the ground that you are walking on

And all is quiet
All is quiet now
And all is silent
All is silent now
Now I don't hide it
I don't hide it now
Now I don't hide it
I don't hide it now
