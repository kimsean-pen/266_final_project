And I want those eyes
Only in one side
Only in the wide
Girl, I'm in the rush

I can't be sure
Ah, anymore
Today or tommorow
What we've come to?
What we've come to?

They gon' get us to come together
They gon' get us to come together
They gon' get us to come together
They gon' get us to come together

I forget my pride
Strolling in your blush
Wanna get so high
Wanna live my life

I can't be sure
Ah, anymore
Today or tommorow
What we've come to?
What we've come to?

They gon' get us to come together
They gon' get us to come together
They gon' get us to come together
They gon' get us to come together

They gon' get us to come together
They gon' get us to come together

(They gon' get us to come together)
(They gon' get us to come together)
