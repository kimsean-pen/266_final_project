Spectral dawn dazzling
Drink deep the mirage
False fantasy
Desiccated dreams
Bones bleached
Wander on
Pilgrimage to nothing

Fear god
Fear death
Fear love

Speak not, make no human connection
This vessel walks alone

Fear life
Fear truth
Fear the unknown

Consciousness floods the brain
In a universe ever-expanding

Spiral into madness
Traversing undulating sands

Impotent god
Infinity lies at your feet
Legacy lost
Fear the burden of creation

And I walk into the light...
But only shadows greet me there
Save me

Is it better to wander than create
When time will only lay to waste
The fruits of our labors?

"Look upon my works, ye mighty, and despair"
Even gods return to dust, a memory forgotten

I see Ozymandias' petrified sneer
Are we all condemned
To wander for eternity?

Master, answers I seek
Master, reveal yourself to me

I have walked the desert lands
The tree of knowledge I have sought
I drank from its roots only to become lost

And perched at the edge of creation
Entire lifetimes passed
I found him and awaited his decree

Beneath the twisted mask, the master was me
