I turn the firehose on
Then I cut away through all'ya
Make you slam against the-
Ooh - Wall
Ooh - Wall
And through the windows of the bank and the pharmacy, eh
I, I, I!

I cordoned off the whole street, then
My horse is on the concrete
Make you quiver and a-
Ooh - Shake
Ooh - Quake
You can't get out of my way so you're split to pieces

If they crawl out of the mud
Wash them away in a flood
I'm only as good as my god
Burnt hair and more money

If they crawl out of the mud
Wash them away in a flood
I'm only as good as my god
Burnt hair and more money

Hah, hah, hah!
Cut off the head of that snake
Then you watch them scatter and break
It's as simple as a-
Ooh - Tick
Ooh - Tock
Defenestrate them all night, let me grab a latte
Uh uh uh!

And on the steps of my church
There, I'm chasing down a red girl with my hooves upon a-
Ooh - Wild
Ooh - Child
I bet you didn't think of this when you woke up this morning

If they crawl out of the mud
Wash them away in a flood
I'm only as good as my god
Burnt hair and more money

If they crawl out of the mud
Wash them away in a flood
I'm only as good as my god
Burnt hair and more money

If they crawl out of the mud
Wash them away in a flood
I'm only as good as my god
Burnt hair and more money

If they crawl out of the mud
Wash them away in a flood
I'm only as good as my god
Burnt hair and more money
