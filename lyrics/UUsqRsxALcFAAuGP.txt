I got your emails
You just don't get females
Now do you
What's in my heart

Is not in your head anyway
Mate you're too late
And your weren't worth the wait

Now were you
It's out of my hands
Since you blew your last chance
When you played me

You'll have to cry me out
You'll have to cry me out
The tears that I'll fall
Mean nothing at all

It's time to get over yourself
Baby you ain't all that
Maybe there's no way back
You can keep talking

But baby I'm walking away
When I found out
How you messed me about
I was broken

Back then I believed you
Now I don't need you
No more
The pic on your phone

Proves you weren't alone
She was with you, yeah
Now I couldn't care
That you weren't aware

We're through
You'll have to cry me out
You'll have to cry me out
The tears that I'll fall

Mean nothing at all
It's time to get over yourself
Baby you ain't all that
Maybe there's no way back

You can keep talking
But baby I'm walking away
Gonna have to cry me out
Gonna have to cry me out

Boy there ain't no doubt
Gonna have to cry me out
Won't hurt a little bit
Boy better get used to it

You can keep talking
But baby I'm walking away
You'll have to cry me out
You'll have to cry me out

The tears that I'll fall
Mean nothing at all
It's time to get over yourself
Baby, you ain't all that
Maybe there's no way back
You can keep talking
But baby I'm walking away
You'll have to cry me out
You'll have to cry me out
The tears that I'll fall
Mean nothing at all
It's time to get over yourself
Baby you ain't all that
Maybe there's no way back
You can keep talking
But baby I'm walking away
