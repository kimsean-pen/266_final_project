Didn't they always say we were the lucky ones?
I guess that we were once, babe, we were once
But luck will leave you 'cause it is a faithless friend
And in the end when life has got you down
You've got someone here that you can wrap your arms around
So hold on to me tight, hold on to me tonight
We are stronger here together than we could ever be alone
So hold on to me, don't you ever let me go
There's a thousand ways for things to fall apart
But it's no one's fault, no, it's not our fault
And maybe all the plans we made might not work out
But I have no doubt even though it's hard to see
I've got faith in us and I believe in you and me
So hold on to me tight, hold on, I promise it'll be alright
'Cause it's you and me together and baby all we've got is time
So hold on to me, hold on to me tonight
There's so many dreams that we have given up
Take a look at all we've got
And with this kind of love what we've got here is enough
So hold on to me tight, hold on, I promise it'll be alright
'Cause we are stronger here together than we could ever be alone
Just hold on to me, don't you ever let me go
Hold on to me, it's gonna be alright, hold on to me tonight
Didn't they always say we were the lucky ones
