Some will go, and some will stay
Make amends and wait for me
Or catch the plane and wait for me to know...
The devastation
(Oh no) Another rainy day

Yesterday I woke afraid
Unable to discern if the fears were even tangible
Yet again I slept so poor
Familiar feelings of powerlessness coming through

Yet in these hours of clarity I'm found
Yet again it's me not them
Unable to react in a way that's even logical
Yet alone right here it seems so clear
Your reaction is the problem, and the outcome is impractical

Yet in these times of weakness I am found
And all my secret sciences are found
Let it go, anyway!
Let it be a part of yesterday!
Let it go, anyway!
Let it be a part of nothing
Let it go, anyway!
It shall be a part of nothing else

Let it go!

Some will go, and will stay
If I make a mess will you wait for me?
'Cause I have to go
Keep your spirits high, and your demons low
They're not dead, they're only sleeping
So keep your voice down
(Yeah!)

Let it go, anyway!
Let it be a part of yesterday
Let it go, anyway!
It was all a lot of nothing
Let it go, anyway!
You will be upon the stars
Let it go, anyway!
Let it be a part of nothing else
