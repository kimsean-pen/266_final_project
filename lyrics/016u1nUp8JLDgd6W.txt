Woke up this morning with my heart on fire
Held on to what I'd been dreaming
Woke up this morning I had one desire
To get back to what I'd been seeing

Heaven, it was heaven,

I have never know any like this,
Witnessed anything like this
Glowing all over as I started on my feet
I thought that I heard somebody calling

Heaven, it was heaven,

Now I know I've seen the light
make it go on shining
I keep on searching for the way to your heart,
try to believe it's getting better,
baby, take me all the way to your heart
I want you... (ohohohoho)

All as we kisses, all the tenderness
That I'm being shared all around it
Only remind me of my only stress
No loving arms to surround me

Falling, I am falling

You can help me out again
being mine forever
I keep on searching for the way to your heart,
try to believe it's getting better,
baby, take me all the way to your heart
I want you... (ohohohoho)

You got it, you got it
There'll be no doubt about it
nobody's going keep me from you - oh
I want you, I need you
I'll find a way to get through
Nobody is going keep me from you - uhuh

Heaven, it was heaven,

Now I know I've seen the light
make it go on shining
I keep on searching for the way to your heart,
try to believe it's getting better,
baby, take me all the way to your heart
I want you... (ohohohoho)

I keep on searching for the way to your heart,
try to believe it's getting better,
baby, take me all the way to your heart
I want you, I want you... (ohohohoho)
