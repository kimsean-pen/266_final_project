Rendition, rendition, blame it on the coalition
All the emeralds that are missing, oh I wish we still had Jack Lemmon
Rendition, rendition I never knew the sky was a prison
It's a long hard revolution, oh good god I feel like a liberal

For tomorrow I will beg, steal and borrow
And at the moment I'm jumping at sorrow
I wish I knew what I did wrong
Can anybody hear the screaming of us? The screaming of us
In the long hard revolution

Rendition, rendition, blame it on the coalition
The CIA will stay invisible, oh good god I sound like a liberal
Rendition, rendition, I never knew the sky was a prison
It's a long hard revolution, oh good god I feel like a liberal

For tomorrow I will beg, steal and borrow
And at the moment I'm jumping at sorrow
I wish I knew what I did wrong
Can anybody hear the screaming of us? The screaming of us
In the long revolution

For tomorrow I will beg, steal and borrow
And at the moment I'm jumping at sorrow
I wish I knew what I did wrong
Can anybody hear the screaming of us? The screaming of us
In the long revolution
