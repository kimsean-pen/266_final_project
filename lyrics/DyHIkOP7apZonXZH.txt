Blood on your hands and your hands still roam
But your secret is safe with the garden gnome
Those marks on your neck never seem to fade
Bring a marching band for the masquerade
Oh lonely man, you know you can
A pocket knife
Will serve you well, remember what you're good for, there's much more to life
Under the sun, it's not what they can see
Until it's no fun, your secret's safe with me
Blow out the candles on your cake
It's another year due with the same mistakes
Blind like a bat, when you hit that wall

Now who's gonna come, who you gonna call?
Oh lonely man, you know you can
A pocket knife
Will serve you well, remember what you're good for, there's much more to life

Under the sun, it's not what they can see
Until it's no fun, your secret is safe with me
I can see you run, I can see you're undone
Shadow to the sun, shadow to the sun
See a rule to break, see another rule to make
It's a good mistake, shadow next to none
Under the sun, it's not what they can see
Until it's no fun, your secret is safe with me
I can see you run, I can see you're undone
Shadow to the sun, shadow to the sun
See a rule to break, see another rule to make
It's a good mistake, shadow next to none

Broken bones, in a walking man
It's a trick to the eye, it's a rubberband
Don't let it go, let it fall apart
It's a heavy load, for a tender heart

Broken bones, in a walking man
It's a trick to the eye, it's a runnerband
Don't let it go, let it fall apart
It's a heavy load, for a tender heart
