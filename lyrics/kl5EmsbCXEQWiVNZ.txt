Â© 2002 Ahimsa Records

I've been hanging out in the boredom basement
Building up the files on my MP3
Homemade rockets and a load of laundry --
It's been a real party ever since you set me free

They say that I'm cool, they tell me I'm strong
Everyone says it's better now that you're gone
So how come everything feels wrong?

I took all the money that I won at the table
Got another record and a phat tattoo
Everybody says, "Hey whatcha gonna do now?"
I've been killing myself trying to keep my mind off of you

They say that I'm cool, they tell me I'm strong
Everyone says it's better now that you're gone
Well maybe everyone is wrong
Everyday I'm alone and everyday's long
Telling myself it's better since you've been gone
So how come everything feels wrong?

How could you let me go?
After it took so long to find me?
Take back your radio -- all of these stupid songs remind me
That everything's wrong and it's become plain
Even if I am strong, we'll never be the same

Everybody says, "Hey, whatcha gonna do now, babe?"
Well, I've done it all and still I am thinking of you

So don't tell me I'm cool and say that I'm strong
Everyone thinks it's better now that you're gone
Well I think everyone is wrong
Cause everyday I'm alone and everyday's long
Telling myself it's better since you've been gone
So how come everything feels wrong?
