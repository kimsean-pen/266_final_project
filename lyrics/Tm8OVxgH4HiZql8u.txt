Sailboats wish that they were stars
floating softly in the sky
among our dreams that bid goodbye
Moving through transparent space
drifting through the stratosphere
and onward till' they disappear

These continents, from over head
look like tiny paper shapes
intricately set in place
Below the misty mountain clouds
there's a lovely silver bay
where sunset sailors often hide away

Scuba diver in the lock
speedboat driver on the dock
sailplane pilot in the blue
take me up there with you
the world looks brighter from this high altitude.
I was walking through the trees

(sailboats wish that they were stars)
and I was swimming through the seas
(cuz' they don't know who they are)
I was falling through the air, when it hit me right there

My eyes are tired and I don't even care
An airplane carried me to bed

where I slept above the coast
and dreamt I had become a ghost
I sailed above the frozen peaks
deep in cold cathedral caves
across the hills and far beyond the waves
Take the car on the run

fly the jet to the sun
and bring the spacecraft in soon
while I play chess with the moon
I feel like sleeping through this cold afternoon.
Once in 1964
(sailboats wish that they were stars)

an actress ran on the shore
(cuz' they don't know who they are)
and though you'll never return
I love you Audrey Hepburn

sometimes I can see your face in the crowd
There are sailboats throughout
this brilliant sky
but you cannot pick them out
if you can't fly
I'm glad the earth doesn't care
if I go up there
If you want to, just ask me and I'll take you along
