Curiosity, I'm caught up in a tree
Want you to get me down but I'm scared of what I see
I need a private eye to see through your disguise
'Cause I wanna know everything

Oh, I'm looking down deep inside you
And I want to climb in but I can't do it
I'm so scared of what I might find there
Do you have something to hide and you can't show it?

I thinking I'm getting hot trying to connect the dots
You're on your tips toes trying hard to not get caught
Some things are unexplained, some people can't be tamed
But I wanna know everything

Oh, I'm looking down deep inside you
And I want to climb in but I can't do it
I'm so scared of what I might find there
Do you have something to hide and you can't show it?

And I want to believe you
I want to believe that you're giving it all up for me
You're so undercover
Keeping it all hush-hush

What happened to us?
I can't believe this, give it up
So I can get to love
I can't believe this
[Inaudible]

[Inaudible]
I can't believe this
Undercovers

Oh, I'm looking down deep inside you
And I want to climb in but I can't do it
I'm so scared of what I might find there
Do you have something to hide and you can't show it?

Oh, I'm looking down deep inside you
And I want to climb in but I can't do it
I'm so scared of what I might find there
Do you have something to hide and you can't show it?

And I want to believe you
I want to believe that you're giving it all up for me
You're so undercover
Keeping it all hush-hush

Oh, I'm looking in your eyes
I wanna grab you and I can't do it
I wanna take you back to real life
I wanna love you and I hope that I can prove it

And when I look down in your eyes
I wanna take off your disguise
