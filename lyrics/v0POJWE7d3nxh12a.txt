Evil night of an evil death
Epitome of Illusion
Sacrifice of the unborn child
Enter the kingdom of darkness
Sodomized for the ritual
For there is nowhere to run
Open the gates to the manifestation
And grant me the powers of darkness

Chorus:
Infernal majesty, take this dead offering
Feeding the demon seed, evil bestowed on me

Exorcise the powers of death
Invert my cross of time
The realm of Satan anarchy
Inside my sacred sign

Lucifer bring me the legions of death
Abbadon kill until nothing is left
Oblivious to evil

(Lead - Eric/Brain)

Death defied the rituals
Of dreams and disillusion
Unlock the box and gimp in pain
Summon the demons of darkness
Evil Gods that fast with flesh
Prepare me for the dead
Release me from the angels so righteous
For your God is dead

Repeat Chorus
