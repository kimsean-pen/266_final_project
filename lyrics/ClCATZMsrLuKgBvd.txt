Time is short
Time is long
It's a flip of the coin
He knows I'll never know

Sometimes right
Always wrong
It's a flip of the coin
I rather love the fall

I don't want to feel the need
To grip on tight to everything I see
I don't want to feel the need
To grip on tight to everything I see

To grip on tight to everything I see

We row on
Facing back
It's a change of the tide
I know I'll never know

Hard to tell where we'll land
It's a change of the tide
I'd rather land ashore

I don't want to feel the need
To grip on tight to everything I see
I don't want to feel the need
To grip on tight to everything I see

And still I give it all
And still I give it all away
And still I give it all
And still I give it all away
I don't want to feel the need
To grip on tight to everything I see
I don't want to feel the need
To grip on tight to everything I see
To grip on tight
To grip on tight to everything I see
