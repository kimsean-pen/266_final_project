We're heavy liftin' but
We're feelin' fine
We think it's funny
When we look at the time
I know co-dependency
Has dragged me out
But I really don't think
That's what this is about

I wanna give it all,
I know I will
'Cause blueberry eyes
Seem to make time still
We can boogie in the
Sunshine with songbirds, bees
And I know you like to
Pull the leaves off trees

I used to think that
Romeo was full of shit
And the Notebook was
Just my favorite chick flick
But now I get why
Sarah was so hard to forget
It's this feeling tha
t I'm feeling I need more than it

Pumpkin, pumpkin
You're gonna kill me
Pumpkin, pumpkin
La, la la la la, la
Pumpkin, pumpkin
I need you to feel me
Pumpkin, pumpkin
La, la la la la, la

We're cruisin' slowly but we're movin' fast
We both decided to thank our past
We've got a hundred
Lists of things we wanna do
But I'm also cool just
Doin' nothin' with you

I ran in circles on
A Monday night
You had to go so
You could make your flight
I looked at my mom
And said, "What do I do?"
She said,
"This look is somethin' and it's new and true"

I used to think that
Romeo was full of shit
And the Notebook
Was just my favorite chick flick
But now I get why
Sarah was so hard to forget
It's this feeling that
I'm feeling I need more than it

Pumpkin, pumpkin
You're gonna kill me
Pumpkin, pumpkin
La, la la la la, la
Pumpkin, pumpkin
Need you to feel me
Pumpkin, pumpkin
La, la la la la, la

I used to think that
Romeo was full of shit
But when I look at
You I think this must be it

Pumpkin, pumpkin
You're gonna kill me
Pumpkin, pumpkin
La, la la la la, la
Pumpkin, pumpkin
I need you to feel me
Pumpkin, pumpkin
La, la la la la, la

Oh
Pumpkin, pumpkin, oh
La la la la la la
La la, ooh-ooh
