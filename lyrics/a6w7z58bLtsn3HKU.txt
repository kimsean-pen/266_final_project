I drove for miles just to find you and find myself
All these screams all these voices in my head
You gave me strength, gave me hope for a lifetime
I never was satisfied

This time, won't you save me
This time, won't you save me
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up
This time, won't you save me
This time, won't you save me
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up
Givin' up, givin' up, givin' up

It's not your fault I'm a bitch, I'm a monster
Yes, I'm a beast, and I feast when I conquer
But I'm alone on my throne all these riches
I came this way, all this way just to say, ay

This time, won't you save me
This time, won't you save me
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up
This time, won't you save me
This time, won't you save me
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up
Givin' up, givin' up, givin' up

I'm giving up baby, yes
(I'm givin' up, baby)
It feels like I've been drivin' for miles (yeah)
(I'm givin' up, baby)
And I can't seem to silence these voices in my head
(This time, won't you save me)
Come save me (This time, won't you save me)
Come save me

This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up
This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up

This time won't you save me
This time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up
Givin' up
