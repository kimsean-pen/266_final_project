There's so much going on
You can think of me
When your hope is gone
You can think of me
To get through anything
You can think of me
I'm here as long as you need me

When nothing seems to work
You can think of me
Your heart is on a search
Let it come to me
I'll make it all reverse
When you think of me
Baby, you can see new life through me

Let me be the reason you get through the day
Know that, I'll make everything okay
Think of me baby in anyway, I'll be all you need
Let me be the one, you turn to when there's pain
Baby, I will take it all away
Hide in me, I'll be your secret place, 'cause it's all in me

When it seems no one loves
You can count on me
When pain is all too much
You can count on me
Need someone to trust
You can count on me
I'm here as long as you need me

When you see brighter days
Know that it was me
When tears are wiped away
Don't guess that it was me
When you realize your pain
Was suffered too by me
Then you know the love in me

Let me be the reason, you get through the day
Know that, I'll make everything okay
Think of me baby in anyway, I'll be all you need
Let me be the one, you turn to when there's pain
Baby, I will take it all away
Hide in me, I'll be your secret place, 'cause it's all in me

4, 3, 4, 3, 2 step
Anything you could ever need
Baby, I promise you can find in me
Don't matter if it's a hope or dream
I promise, I can make it a reality
Nothing ever to much for you
Anything that's possible, I would do
To make it all so clear to you
That my love for you is more than true

Anything you could ever need

Everyday, every night, break of dawn
Air of night, come to me, I'll make it right
If you let me, it's all in me
