Try to hold on
Though it seems you can't go on
You know that you can be strong
Find a way to carry on

And God bless your soul
In the heavens up above
If you can't find a way
You must know that you are loved

Try to be strong
Find a way to carry on
I know you are brave
And I hope you find your way

Is there a reason why
the sky gets black at night and
Our hearts feel like stone
And you're left to face this alone?

Try to be strong
Find a way to carry on
I know you are brave
And I hope you find your way
I know you are brave
And I hope you find your way
