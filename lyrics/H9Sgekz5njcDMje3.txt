In the hall, tension breaks down
He wrote songs, they started quietly
Ended with a sound, a feeling all around
On the hill, secrets exposed

Memories, seeing different sides
Walking back to your swimming pool
The leaves were red, the air was blue
On my street, feelings come true

Street lights surround this place we found
