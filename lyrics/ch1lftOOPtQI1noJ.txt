While you wait for the others
To make it all worthwhile
All your useless pretentions
Are weighing on my time

You could beg for forgiveness
As long as you like
Or just wait out the evening
You'll only leave me dry

Yes, you'll only leave me dry

So I'll ask you kindly to make your way
And what was there?
The perfect glare
We all fall through

While you wait on the answers
That I'll pretend to find
Keeping up with emotions
Still occupies our time

You could hope for some substance
As long as you like
Or just wait out the evening
And always ask me why

Yes, you'll only leave me dry

So I'll ask you kindly to make your way
And what was left?
The perfect glare
We all fall through

And all we want, want, want, want, want, want, want, want
Want, want, want, want, want, want
Want, want, want, want
Want, want, want

And what was there?
And what was there?
And what wasn't there?
