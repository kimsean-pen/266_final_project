I'm not your woman
I'm not your man
I am something
That you'll never understand
I'll never beat you
I'll never lie
And if you're evil
I'll forgive you by and by

'Cos you
I would die for you, yeah
Darlin', if you want me to you
I would die for you

I'm not your lover
I'm not your friend
I am something that you'll
Never comprehend
No need to worry
No need to cry
I'm your messiah and you're
The reason why

'Cos you
I would die for you, yeah
Darlin', if you want me to you
I would die for you

You're just a sinner I am told
Be your fire when you're cold
Make you happy when you're sad
Make you good when you are bad
I'm not a human, I am a dove
I'm your conscience, I am love
All All I really need
Is to know that you believe

"Yeah"
'Cos you, I would die for you, yeah
Darlin', if you want me to you
I would die for you

Yeah, say it one more time
You, I would die for you
Youhoe
Darlin', if you want me to you
I would die for you

"2, 3, 4, you"

I would die for you
I would die for you
You, I would die for you
You, I would die for you
