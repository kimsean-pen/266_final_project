I've been biding my time
Been so subtly kind
I've got to think so selfishly
'Cos you're the face inside of me

I've been biding my days
You see evidently it pays
I've been a friend with unbiased views
Then secretly lust after you

So now, you feel rusty
You're bored and bemused

You wanna do someone else
So you should be by yourself
Instead of here with me secretly

Trying hard to think pure
Bloody hard when I'm raw
You're talking out so sexually
'Bout boys and girls and your friggin' dreams

So now, you feel lusty
You're hot and confused

You wanna do someone else
So you should be by yourself
Instead of here with me secretly

So now, you've been busted
You're caught feeling used

You had to do someone else
You should've been by yourself
You had to do someone else
You should've been by yourself
Instead of here with me secretly

Secretly, secretly
