You step on all my parts
And then you walk right out the door
And I know that your
Love ain't never
Comin' back no more

Time is all around
Except inside my clock
Everybody's
Waiting for their
Lover to unlock

Leaves become most beautiful when they're about to die
When they're about to fall from trees
When they're about to dry
Up

Time is all around
Time is all a
Round

I hallucinate
A cat between my feet
I'm stepping lightly so as not to
Hurt
It
Everybody wants
To say that you have changed
Of course you've changed, you've changed, you've changed
Your mind's been rearranged

But leaves become most beautiful when they're about to die
When they're about to fall from trees
When they're about to dry
Up

Leaves become most beautiful when they're about to die
When they're about to fall from trees
When they're about to dry
Up

Why am I supposed to love if I don't want to love?
Why am I supposed to
I'm so tired
Why am I supposed to love if I don't want to?
I don't want
I don't want to
I don't want

Leaves become most beautiful when they're about to die
When they're about to fall from trees
When they're about to dry
Up

Leaves become most beautiful when they're about to die
When they're about to fall from trees
When they're about to dry
Up
