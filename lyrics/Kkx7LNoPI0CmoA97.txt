Ray of light annoying as a cold breath in the eyes
Water falls down

Lights around are flashing
And in meat a razorblade
Water falls down

Seems to be the day
I cannot handle this
Listen to the music in my mind
For a while

Seems to be my hour
My shell has disappeared
Swallow whirls of dust into my mouth

But it's wonderful I know

Hiding all my fear
My nightmare is becoming real
Take a look at me
I'm a loser

Hiding all my crimes and then
Forgetting all my ideas
Take a look at me
I'm a loser

But it's wonderful I know
But it's wonderful I know
But it's wonderful I know
But it's wonderful I know

Hiding all my fear
My nightmare is becoming real
Come and take a look at me
I'm a loser

Hiding all my crimes and then
Forgetting all my ideas
Take a look at me
I'm a loser

Hiding all my fear
My nightmare is becoming real
Come and take a look at me
I'm a loser

Hiding all my crimes and then
Forgetting all my ideas
Take a look at me
I'm a loser
I'm a loser
I'm a loser
I'm a loser
I'm a loser
It's just an illusion
I'm a loser
I'm a loser
