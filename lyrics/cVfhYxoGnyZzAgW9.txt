When we were young
We could piss up the boys boat wall
A black expanse of pitch
Or tar, or whatever it was
It doesn't matter much anymore
And tussles with the girls
Before the advent of pubescent awe and confusion
Knickers thick, pasty in the roar of adolescence's dawn

How innocent and cruel
Ran the gauntlet of first stirrings
In the changing rooms of May

Where are you now?
Don't answer that
I'm still ugly
You're still fat
I've still got spots
I'm still afraid

Our parents made us what we are
Or was it God?
Who gives a fuck, it's never really over
