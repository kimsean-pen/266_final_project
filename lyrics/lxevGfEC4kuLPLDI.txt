My nigga made sure you were?
(How could you ever pop a pill pack)
I won't let you go
(My nigga made sure you were? for real)
(How could you ever pop a pill pack)

I control the speed and I won't let you go, no, no way
You're everything I love
Hoes and weed
And I could testify
Cause who's ashamed
So I might testify

I got a face that only your bitch could love
Your type niggas don't mix with us
Ain't this special like just because
Backpack full of that wrist and lung
Boarding pass, pass my troubles
High as fuck, lost my wallet
Going back, back to Cali
Saw my son, miss my daughter
Real life
What does it feel like?
I got my pills on
You know I'm real numb
Gettin' ready for this motherfucker

I control the speed and I won't let you go, no away
You're everything I love
Hoes and weed
And I could testify
Cause who's ashamed
So I might testify

I can't admit
I've been depressed, I hit a wall, ouch
I hit the bank, you hit the dab
I hit the ball, out
Praying God pay my cable
Splurging out one more favor
Little boys dressed like rappers
Can that road make them daddies?
I talked to God
I got approve, I got a lifeline
If I should die
While I'm awake, I had a nice time

I control the speed and I won't let you go, no away
You're everything I love
(Everything I love, how could you ever say no?)
