Ohh, I been hurtin' lately
I'm down on all my luck
Sometimes there's no one there by your side
I don't deserve this baby
But I know that I can't give up
Tough times I just take them in stride

Hmmm, I'm almost there, only one more step
(Left, right, left, right, left)
I'm moving on, I got no regrets

(Left, right, left, right, left)

I said times are changing, tell me how can I keep up
Every time that I turn around there's a wall
But I'm climbing daily, until I see the top
And I get up right after every fall
When you're brokenhearted
And you're lost without me
Yeah you gotta walk alone, yeah it's true

Flash every smile cause I've been lost for miles
I know you've felt this way before too
We're almost there baby one more step
Woah, left, right, left, right, left
We're moving on, we got no regrets
Woah, left, right, left, right, left
Woah, left, right, left, right, left
Woah, left, right, left, right, left

Woah, we're almost there only one more step
Woah, left, right, left, right, left

Mmm I know it looks like it's too far

But it's nothing compared to how far we've come
Walking down this boulevard
When the darkest times come right before the sun
We're almost there baby one more step
Woah, left, right, left, right, left
We're moving forward and there's no regrets
Woah, left, right, left, right, left
Woah, left, right, left, right, left
Woah, left, right, left, right, left
We're almost there only one more step
Woah, left, right, left, right, left
Woah, left, right, left, right, left
Woah, left, right, left, right, left
Woah, left, right, left, right, left
We're almost there only one more step
Woah, left, right, left, right, left
