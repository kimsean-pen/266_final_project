Ducks In a Pond Tiago Iorc
Why should we be
So cautions with each other
When we know what lies beneath the pain
Focus, don't focus on what's wrong
Like pretty ducks in a pond we'll be
Like pretty ducks in a pond we'll be free from it all
Don't focus on what's wrong
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

Why should we be
So cautions with each other
When we know what lies beneath the pain
Focus, don't focus on what's wrong
Like pretty ducks in a pond we'll be
Like pretty ducks in a pond we'll be free from it all
Don't focus on what's wrong
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

So, it's over now just let it go
Don't be so cold
Hate is not the answer
