In the air I'm tasting your perfection
Forgive me dear for my misdirection
As I crawl beneath this torture you adore
I fall face to face with my scars you've ignored

So tell me why it don't feel the same
Tell me why I've got to feel this way
Yeah you leave, you're gone
And I'm left here with the blame
So tell me why it don't feel the same

All my props I swear they were in order
Even with the warnings of your thunder
Now I'll pause to let my silence scream tonight
While you roam like a serpent satellite

Tell me why it don't feel the same
Tell me why I've got to feel this way
Yeah you leave, you're gone
And I'm left here with the blame
So tell me why it don't feel the same

So tell me why it don't feel the same
Tell me why I've got to feel this way
Yeah you leave, you're gone
And I'm left here with the blame
So tell me why it don't feel the same
