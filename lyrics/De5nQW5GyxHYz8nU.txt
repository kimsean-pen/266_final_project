Hey Joe, where you going with that gun in your hand
Hey Joe, I said where you going with that gun in your hand

I'm going down to shoot my old lady
I caught her messing 'round with another man

I'm going down to shoot my old lady now
You know I caught her messing 'round with another man
And that ain't too cool

Hey Joe, I heard you shot your woman down
You shot her down now
Hey Joe, I heard you shot your lady down
You shot her down to the ground

Yes I did shot her
You know I caught her messing 'round down

Yes I did shot her
You know I caught my her messing 'round down
And I gave her the gun
You shot her

Hey Joe
Where you gonna run
Hey Joe
Where you gonna run

I'm going way down south
Way down to Mexico way

I'm going way down south
Way down where I can be free

Ain't no one gonna mess
He ain't gonna put a rope me

Hey, Joe, you better run on down
Goodbye everybody
