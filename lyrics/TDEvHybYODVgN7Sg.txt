Should we call this place forever?
Our life is just your radio show
Would you go with me wherever
And not be American anymore?
Find another home

Walk all night, walk all night
Walk all night, put the Value Saver down
Walk all night, let's find a car and fool around
Walk all night, following the road

We wait for the night
We wait for the night
Following the road

Would we call this place forever?
Our lives are just a speech in some school
Will you clean this town forever?
And I'll be the king of the carpool
Following the road

Will we call this place forever? (Walk all night)
Our lives are just a speech in some school (Walk all night)
Will I wear this town forever (Walk all night)
And you'll be the queen of the drive-thru? (Walk all night)
