I've been a dirty bastard
But I will clean my act up
I wanna stop doing bad
I wanna meet your mum and dad

It's not an unpretending
Little happy ending
This is a Grande Finale
Rolling snare drums echo
The rain sounds like applause

I've finally found you
The one that I've been waiting for
I've finally found what
I'd already stopped looking for

I've been a dirty bastard
But I will clean my act up
I wanna stop doing bad
I wanna meet your mum and dad

I've been a dirty bastard
But I will clean my act up
I wanna stop doing bad
I wanna meet your mum and dad
It's not an unpretending
Little happy ending
This is a Grande Finale
Rolling snare drums echo
The rain sounds like applause
I've finally found you
The one that I've been waiting for
I've finally found what
I'd already stopped looking for

Ohohoho
Rolling snare drums echo
Ohohoho
The rain sounds like applause

I've finally found you
The one that I've been waiting for
I've finally found what
I'd already stopped looking for

Ohohoho
Rolling snare drums echo
Ohohoho
The rain sounds like applause

I've finally found you
The one that I've been waiting for
I've finally found what
I'd already stopped looking for
