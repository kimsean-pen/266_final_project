I could have a real good time if I had a gun
I know, well I know. The things I do and say
And if I did not have no gun well I know, I know
I've got a knife.
Well, Gary Floyd and all his pals are gonna' come on down
To the roundaround. They're gonna' shoot all day.
Saw the nature in the swimming pool
In a two-piece oh and I lost my cool
Well I'm cool-the things I do and say
The color brown is coming down
I feel my head go round and round and round (etc.)
Well, Gary Floyd and all his pals are gonna' come on down
To the roundaround. They're gonna' shoot all day.
