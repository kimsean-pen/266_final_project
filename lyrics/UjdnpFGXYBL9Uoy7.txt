Lost in a dream
Dont know which way to go
If you are all that you seem
Than maybe Im moving way too slow
Ive been a fool before
When you lied to get my love
Caught in the slamming door
How about some information, please
Straight up and tell me
Do you really want love?
And me forever?
Am I talking hit and run?
Straight up, now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together?
Or are you just having fun?
Times standing too
Waiting for some small...
I keep getting chill
When I think your love is true
Ive been a fool before
When you lied to get my love
Caught in the slamming door
How about some information, please
So now you tell me
Do you really want love?
And me forever?
Am I talking hit and run?
Straight up, now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together?
Or are you just having fun?
Do you love me?
Do, do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do, do you love me?
Ive been a fool before
When you lied to get my love
Caught in the slamming door
How about some information, please
Straight up and tell me
Do you really want love?
And me forever?
Am I talking hit and run?
Straight up, now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together?
Or are you just having fun?
Straight up and tell me
