Bleed these colors open wide
Burning blues from butterflies
(Tonight we, Tonight we fly)
Flying faster through the night
Until the orange of morning light
(Dear black goodbye, Dear black goodbye)

I know it's hard to make this work
When you're all alone (Alone)
And I've been waiting for so long
To hold you in my arms
Embrace forever my sweet girl

Water fills these open eyes
(Tonight we fly)
Still flames in valentines
Won't keep me in her mind
(Dear black goodbye, Dear black goodbye)
I know it's hard to make this work
When you're all alone (Alone)

And I've been waiting for so long
To hold you in my arms
Embrace forever my sweet girl

And I've been waiting for so long
To hold you in my arms
Embrace forever my sweet girl

You are the ghost of everything that I'm not
dont want to be

You are the ghost of everything that I'm not
dont want to be

Dear black goodbye (Goodbye)
Don't forget to write
Your name inside of my life
And I know it's hard to make this work
When you're all alone (Alone)

I've been waiting for so long
To hold you in my arms
Embrace forever my sweet girl

I've been waiting for so long
To hold you in my arms
Embrace forever my sweet girl
