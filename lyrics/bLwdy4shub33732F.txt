Looking back, losing track of time
With my dull sense and frame of mind
I can swear that I'm crazy
And stop feeling lazy
You're my own attempt to relate
I can't escape
From these routine days
I have to repeat themes
Losing too much sleep over thoughts entertained

Write me off like you never had the pen at all
I didn't surely find the walls you built in my head
Fade away like I never even came the spark
I wasted all my time distracted by the wrong wealth
I always thought I had it figured out all for myself
I ran for miles just to come out and too short
So write me off like you never had the pen at all

Motionless
Motionless I lay
In my grave filled with empathy
It's so easy to get caught up
In the what-ifs left untouched
I can't explain
The reasons why I think about these things
The little imperfections point erupt
A comic raptor always feeling stuck

Write me off like you never had the pen at all
I didn't surely find the walls you built in my head
Fade away like I never even came the spark
I wasted all my time distracted by the wrong wealth
I always thought I had it figured out all for myself
I ran for miles just to come out and too short
So write me off like you never had the pen at all

I'm busy counting down the days
Cause I could really use a break
Through carrying this weight around my neck
I stress and overcompensate for what's next
Yeah we can cross that bridge in time
Yeah we can cross that bridge in line

Write me off like you never had the pen at all
I didn't surely find the walls you built in my head
Fade away like I never even came the spark
I wasted all my time distracted by the wrong wealth
I always thought I had it figured out all for myself
I ran for miles just to come out and too short
So write me off like you never had the pen at all
