You caught me smilin' again.
You caught me smilin' again.
Hangin' loose
'Cause you ain't used to seeing me turnin' on.

You caught me smilin' again.
You caught me smilin' again.
I'll be gone
And it won't take you long to climb a tree about me.

You caught me smilin' again.
You caught me smilin' again.

I'll be around to carry on!

Hey, you caught me smilin' again.
You caught me smilin' again.
In my pain I'll be sane to take your hand.
