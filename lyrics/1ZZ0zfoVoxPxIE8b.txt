Nobody knows
What happened to forever
People come just to go
And then it's like 'whatever'

But when we get close
Hands on your skin
You make it rain
And I could just stop in
But why don't we both
Get a little wetter

We can get it all at once
Run, the river dries
And then it'll be gone

But trust me that's not what you want
Trust me that ain't what I want

I wanna slow burn
Hot with desire
Baby hold up
Don't blow at the fire

Slow burn
That's how I want it
That little sweat
Never hurt nobody

Corazón
Es el momento
De enamorarnos
A fuego lento

Y amor
Tu movimiento
Hace que arda
Y me queme por dentro

Lento
A fuego

A fuego
Lento
A fuego

No, don't blow at the fire

I know the taste
Savor every second
And I know the place
Where I'm gonna get it

No need to rush
I like the chase
Steady, slow baby
This ain't a race

I know the way
You know where it's headed

We can get it all at once
Run, the river dries
And then it'll be gone

Trust me that's not what you want
Trust me that ain't what I want

I wanna slow burn
Hot with desire
Baby hold up
Don't blow at the fire

Slow burn
That's how I want it
That little sweat
Never hurt nobody

Corazón
Es el momento
De enamorarnos
A fuego lento

Y amor
Tu movimiento
Hace que arda
Y me queme por dentro

Lento
A fuego

A fuego
Lento
A fuego

No, don't blow at the fire

We can get it all at once
Run, the river dries
And then it'll be gone

Trust me that's not what you want
Trust me that ain't what I want

I wanna slow burn
Hot with desire
Baby hold up
Don't blow at the fire

Slow burn
That's how I want it
That little sweat
Never hurt nobody

Corazón
Es el momento
De enamorarnos
