Threw you the obvious
And you flew with it on your back
A name in your recollection
Down among a million same

Difficult not to feel a little bit disappointed
And passed over
When I look right through
See you naked but oblivious
And you don't see me

But I threw you the obvious
Just to see if there's more behind the
Eyes of a fallen angel
Eyes of a tragedy

Here I am expecting just a little bit
Too much from the wounded
But I see, see through it all
See through
See you

'Cause I threw you the obvious
To see what occurs behind the
Eyes of a fallen angel
Eyes of a tragedy

Oh, well
Oh, well
Apparently nothing
Apparently nothing at all

You don't
You don't
You don't
See me
You don't
You don't
You don't
See me
You don't
You don't
You don't
See me
You don't
You don't
You don't
See me
You don't
See me
You don't
You don't
You don't see me at all
