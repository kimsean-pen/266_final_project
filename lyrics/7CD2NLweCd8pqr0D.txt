You feel it, you boxed it by the youth you left behind
Does anybody see you anymore?
But if we can get free, there's a big bright world to see
Forget about the way it felt before

Try to breathe the air that's here and now
Try to find some peace in falling out

We don't have to say goodbye
But we can't get lost in time
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
Maybe in another life

You tell me there must be a little light left flickering
Burning in a place we set afire
But no one will listen if we just wait here to burn
We've gotta swing away, gotta cut the wire

Try to breathe the air that's here and now
Try to find some peace in falling out

We don't have to say goodbye
But we can't get lost in time
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
Maybe in another life

We don't have to say goodbye
But we can't get lost in time
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
Maybe in another life

We don't have to say goodbye
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
