Black rose and a radio fire
It's so contagious
It's just something changing my mind
I'm gonna take what's evil

Your cover melting inside
With wide eyes, you tremble
Kissing over and over again
Your god knows his faithful

I try to digest my pride
But passion's grip I fear
When I climb into shallow vats of wine
I think I almost hear
But it's not clear

You are the one
You'll never be alone again
You're more than in my head
You're more...

You are the one
You'll never be alone again
You're more than in my head
You're more...

Spin faster, shouting out loud
You can't steal what's paid for
It's just something hurting again
Murder, son, she's painful

You so believe your own lies
On my skin your fingers
Run away until the last time
We're gonna lose forever

When you try
Don't try to say you won't
Try to crawl into my head
When you cry 'cause it's all built up inside
Your tears already said
Already said...

You are the one
You'll never be alone again
You're more than in my head
You're more...

You are the one
You'll never be alone again
You're more than in my head
You're more...

You'll never be alone again

You are the one
You'll never be alone again
You're more than in my head
You're more...

You are the one
You'll never be alone again.
You're more than in my head
You're more...

Alone again
