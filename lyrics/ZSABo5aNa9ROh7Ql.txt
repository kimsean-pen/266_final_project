Title the endings of my life
Speak through the memory
On a path to dynasty
Killed my sexuality

Change everything
Turn me on again
We used fall in love together
This Dynasty

Keep us crushing in the past
We used fall in love together

If my blood is in a shell
I will need to let it bleed
I feel it coming on me
Save my sexuality

Finally
We're teenagers again
In the rain
This Dynasty

It's a happening again
Lets go and together
This is changing everything
