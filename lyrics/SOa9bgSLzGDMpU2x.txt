Can I keep it together,
under stress and whatever,
tried to pin point my problems,
but I can never solve them,
so I fall into pieces,
but nothing releases,
and the cycle starts over,
while the days get colder

Push away, I'm trying,
to seperate my findings,
and be ok remind me,
that nothing good can come from all this Hate,
it floods my heart, within this way,
Can any one save me now?

What to do in the meantime,
steady walkin a straight line,
til my vision gets blurry,
and my head is full of worry,
so I fall into pieces and nothing releases,
and the cycle starts over,
while the days get colder.

Push away, I'm trying,
to seperate my findings,
and be ok, remind me,
that nothing good can come from all this Hate,
it floods my heart, with endless rain,
Can any one save me now??

Theres Still a heart beat,
somewhere in me,
Theres still a heart to find and bring to life...

but Nothing good can come from all this Hate,
it floods my heart, within this way,

Theres still a heart beat,
somewhere in Me,
Theres still a heart to find and bring to Life!
