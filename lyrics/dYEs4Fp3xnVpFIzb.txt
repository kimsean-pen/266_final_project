Something makes me leave again
I've been locked up in a way that I don't understand
I've been chasing numbers, no mercy now
Feeling the best when I'm alone
Feeling the best when I'm alone

Something's wrong with that look in your eyes
Wasn't sure that's why I had to look twice
I'm still not cool with you
Feeling the best when I'm alone

Give me something ah ah
(Oh) give me something to rely on
Give me something to rely my feelings on
Mhmhmhmm
Feeling quite alone but I love the loneliness

Something makes me leave again
I've been locked up in a way that I don't understand
I've been chasing numbers, no mercy now
Feeling the best when I'm alone
Feeling the best when I'm alone

Something's wrong with that look in your eyes
Wasn't sure that's why I had to look twice
I'm still not cool with you
Feeling the best when I'm alone
Something's wrong with that look in your eyes
Wasn't sure that's why I had to look twice
I'm still not cool with you
Feeling the best when I'm alone

I am so close to breakin' down
I need to get it all together
Get it together in my mind
So you know I am so close to breaking down for sure
I need to get it all together in my mind
Get it together in my mind

Feeling the best when I'm alone
Something's wrong with that look in your eyes
Wasn't sure that's why I had to look twice
I'm still not cool with you
Feeling the best when I'm alone
Something's wrong with that look in your eyes
Wasn't sure that's why I had to look twice
I'm still not cool with you
