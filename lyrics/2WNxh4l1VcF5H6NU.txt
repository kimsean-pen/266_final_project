Through heaven and hell
That's what you said
Through sickness and health, oh
That's what you said

'Cause no one knows
What we've been through
(That's what you said)
And no one knows
Me like you do
(That's what you said)
No matter

I could've waited for someone to come around
For someone who wouldn't leave a bad taste in my mouth
But life gave me you and I made
Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade
Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade

I pucker my lips, you could be pretty sour
Add sugar and water, just something to wash it down
'Cause life gave me you and I made
Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade
Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade

For better or worse
That's what you said
From propose to hearse, oh
That's what you said

'Cause no one knows
What we've been through
(That's what you said)
And no one knows
Me like you do
(That's what you said)
No matter

I could've waited for someone to come around
For someone who wouldn't leave a bad taste in my mouth
But life gave me you and I made
Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade
Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade

I pucker my lips, you could be pretty sour
Add sugar and water, just something to wash it down
'Cause life gave me you and I made
Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade
Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade

Nobody's perfect, no
We're tryin' the best we can
And the pain it's so often, oh
From the moments like this
When you're holding my hand

And you're kissing all over my shoulders
Down to my thighs
I haven't told you why
But you don't see who I am inside
'Cause you believed and preconceived
This love was born again
You're that paranoid, yeah
But paradise is on the table
Just let me show you how sweet this life can be

I could've waited for someone to come around
For someone who wouldn't leave a bad taste in my mouth
But life gave me you and I made
Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade
Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade

I pucker my lips, you could be pretty sour
Add sugar and water, just something to wash it down
'Cause life gave me you and I made
Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade
Lemonade, lemonade, lemonade
