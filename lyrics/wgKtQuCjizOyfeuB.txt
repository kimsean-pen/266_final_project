Ghost Rider motorcycle hero
Hey, baby, baby, baby he's a lookin' so cute
Sneakin' 'round, 'round, 'round in a blue jumpsuit

Ghost Rider motorcycle hero
Hey, baby, baby, baby he's a blazin' away
Like the stars, stars, stars in the universe

Ghost Rider motorcycle hero
Hey, baby, baby, baby he's screamin' the truth
America, America's killin' its youth

Hey, baby, baby, baby he's screamin' away
America, America's killin' its youth
America, America's killin' its youth
