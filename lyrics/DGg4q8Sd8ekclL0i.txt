Diamond rings help me sing
Jesus Christ makes me nice
Baby, can't you see?
This is good for me
And baby, can't you see?
This is what I need

Meditate, you can get rich quick
Don't talk, just like my shit
On the streets, yeah I feel so chique
Sellin' jeans that I bought last week, last week, last week
That was so last week
Now I need a new thing, new thing, new thing
Can I get your name?
I can do your thing

Summertime helps me rhyme
Oh gluten-free, it's killin' me
And no need to pray
I got nothin' to say
And baby I get paid
'Cause I'm a DJ

Meditate, you can get rich quick
Don't talk, just like my shit
On the streets, yeah I feel so chique
Sellin' jeans that I bought last week, last week, last week
That was so last week
Now I need a new thing, new thing, new thing
Can I get your name?
I can do your thing

Meditate, you can get rich quick
Don't talk, just like my shit
On the streets, yeah I feel so chique
Sellin' jeans that I bought last week, last week, last week
That was so last week
Now I need a new thing, new thing, new thing
Can I get your name?
I can do your thing
