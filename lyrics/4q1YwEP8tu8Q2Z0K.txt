Drink up beautiful.
I spiked your cup with angst and a heart attack,
'cause I've got so much trapped
It's all because of you.
So I figured you might like some back.

And when I see her
I'll tell her what's been on my mind
All these sleepless nights.
She'll recite her excuses
Put my tail between these legs of mine
Like I do all the time.

I can't live my life
Knowing you'll be in his arms each time I blink my eyes.
Know what goes on behind my back every night,
Afraid I'll never leave,
Afraid I'll never know what's good for me.

And when I see her
I'll tell her what's been on my mind
All these sleepless nights.
She'll recite her excuses
Put my tail between these legs of mine
Like I do all the time.

And now you say that,
You say you love me.
Well I may have your heart,
He has your body.
And now you swear that you're being honest,
But you're not honest,
And you never could be.

And when I see her
I'll tell her what's been on my mind
All these sleepless nights.
She'll recite her excuses
Put my tail between these legs of mine
Like I do all the time.
