See them standing in the foothills
Waiting for the kill
On wings of fear the terror sweeps
Into the city beat

To defend
This is the pact
But when life's scorned
And damage done
To avenge
This is the pact

On wings of vengeance
Taarna finds them
Death for barbarians

To defend
This is the pact
But when life's scorned
And damage done
To avenge
This is the pact

Flying over the oasis
She is captured
And they pull her down

Feeling pain (ah)
From the air (ah)
Close my eyes (ah)
And I am there (ah)
I feel I'm falling down in a deep dark pit

"Pull him down," the soldier said
"I'll put an arrow in his head"
But the bird flew off instead
To save his master, on his back she fled
Her time has come

Riding her bird high in the saddle
She gets her chance to fulfill the pact now
As their leader swoops from the clouds
She sticks him with her sword then she throws him down

The enemy shrivel and die
The enemy shrivel and die
To defend
This is the pact
But when life's scorned
And damage done
To avenge
This is the pact
