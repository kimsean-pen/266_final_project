Is it the way that I move with you
Is it the way that my body grooves
Can I persuade our hips to move
All of the time in [?]

You've got me feeling like
I can't hold you
We ain't going to fight
Let's flow with it
This feeling I have inside
Is it my lips that long for you
Is it the heart that's breaking through
Can we use all this love we ooze
Let's try, but we always confuse it

I've got a feeling

You've got me feeling like
You've got me feeling, you've got me feeling
Like I can't hold you, I can't hold you
I can't hold you, baby
We ain't gonna fight it, ain't gonna fight it anymore
Just flow with
