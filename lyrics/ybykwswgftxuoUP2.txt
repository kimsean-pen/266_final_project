Back in the 90s, I was in a very famous tv show
I'm BoJack the Horse, BoJack the Horse
Don't act like you don't know
And i'm trying to hold on to my past
It's been so long
I don't think i'm gonna last
I guess i'll just try
And make you understand
That i'm more horse than a man
Or i'm more man than a horse
(BoJack!)
