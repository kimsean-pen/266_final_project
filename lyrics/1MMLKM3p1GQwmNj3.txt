You know that I don't talk about you, anymore

I've been trying to stay in line with you, and my good time
And i've been thinking what you're thinking,
Yeh i've been thinking what you're thinking
Yeh i've been thinking bout' you

I feel that feeling, I feel i'm coming down
But for some reason, I come around, come around
I know that feeling, I know i'm coming down
But for some reason, I'm still around, still around

You know that I don't f*ck with the truth, f*ck with the truth, and I won't

I've been dying to tell a lie
Well just to stop from crying, coz i'm thinking what i'm thinking
Do you know what i'm thinking? When i'm not thinking bout' you?

Running around, running, running, running around, running around

I feel that feeling, I feel i'm coming down
But for some reason, come around, come around
I know that feeling, I know what's going down
But for some reason, I'm still around, still around
