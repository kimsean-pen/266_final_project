I've been thinking lately
About you and me
And all the questions left unanswered
How it all could be
And I hope you know
You never left my head
And if I ever let you down
I'm sorry

Woah-ohh
Oh no no no...
Woah-ohh

I've seen you around here lately
You smile brighter than you should
And me I've been so lonely
I'm glad you're doing good
Cuz I can't forget the way it used to be
And if I ever let you down
Well I'm sorry

Woah-oh-oh-oh
No I can't let you...
Go-oh-oh-oh
And you know that you can...
Take all of me
I swear I will be
Better than before
So sing it back
Woah-oh-oh-oh
No I can't let you go

I'm sorry for the things I've done, things I've done
I'm sorry for the man I was
And how I treated you
I'm sorry for the things I've done, things I've done
I'm sorry for the man I was
And how I treated you

Woah-oh-oh-oh...
No I can't let you
Go-oh-oh-oh...

And you know that you can
Take all of me, I swear I will be

better than before
So sing it back
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh...
No I can't let you go
I've been thinking lately
about you and me
And all the questions left unanswered
How it all could be
And I hope you know
You never left my head
And if I've ever left you down
I'm sorry
