I don't wanna be no man's woman
It don't make me happy this mantrolling
Thing that you got for me so I become
No man's woman

I don't wanna be no man's woman
I've other work I want to get done
I haven't traveled this far to become
No man's woman
No man's woman

'Cause I'm tired of it
And I'm not scared of it
That I'll never trust again
'Cause a man could fake you
Take your soul and make you
Miserable in so much pain

My friends think I'm alone but I've got secrets
I don't tell everything about the love I get
I got a lovin man but he's a spirit

He never does me harm never treats me bad
He never takes away all the love he has
And I forgive him a million times

I'm never tired of it
And I'm not scared of it
'Cause it doesn't cause me pain
Like a man could fake you
Take your soul and make you
Never be yourself again

I never wanna be no man's woman
I only wanna be my own woman
I haven't traveled this far to become
No man's woman
No man's woman
No man's woman
