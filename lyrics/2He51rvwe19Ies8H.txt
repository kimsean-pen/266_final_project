Take a piece of my heart
Take a piece of my soul
Let me live

Why don't you take another little piece of my heart?
Why don't you take it and break it and tear it all apart?
All I do is give and all you do is take
Baby, why don't you give me a brand new start?

So let me live, so let me live
Let me live, leave me alone
Let me live, baby
And make a brand new start

Why don't you take another little piece of my soul?
Why don't you shape it and shake it 'til you're really in control?
All you do is take and all I do is give
All that I'm askin' is a chance to live

So let me live, so let me live
Leave me alone, let me live, let me live
Why don't you let me make a brand new start?

And it's a long hard struggle
But you can always depend on me
And if you're ever in trouble
You know where I will be

Why don't you take another little piece of my life?
Why don't you twist it and turn it and cut it like a knife?
All you do is live, all I do is die
Why can't we just be friends, stop livin' a lie?

So let me live, so let me live
Let me live, leave me alone
Please, let me live
Why don't you live a little, baby?
Why don't you give a little love?

Go for it, baby

Let me live
Please, let me live
Baby, let me live
And make a brand new start

Let me live, let me live
Let me live
Come on, let me live
In your heart, baby

Take another piece, take another piece
Take another piece, take another piece
Please, let me live
Take another piece, take another piece
Take another piece, take another piece
Why don't you take another piece?
Take another little piece of my heart, baby

Make a brand new start
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
All you do is take, take
Let me live, let me live
Oh, yeah, let
Let me live
