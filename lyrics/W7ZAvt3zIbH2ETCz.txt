I spent my last dollar
On a motherfucking cab
I remember when I was
Grounded for a
Motherfucking bag, yeah
Check the checking account
Like what a
Motherfucking drag, damn
Ran away from my
Problems floating off a tab
My ex girl got a new 10
And a pic on her
IG with a new man
And I wanna be happy,
She's happy but damn, damn
My heart keep fucking up
The motherfucking plan, hey

Is this what you wanted?
We get drunk, we get high
We talk pills until the morning
We don't care, we don't mind
Pretend everything is awesome
While the world burns outside
Is this what you wanted?
Is that what you wanted?

All sizes and all ages
We sick in the mind,
It's contagious
I get off stage,
The night rages
But I turn on the news
And these kids in cages
Fuck

We're told not to
Trust our neighbors
We selling our
Soul to get famous
To escape it,
We just get wasted
Induce pain, maintain
Remain faceless

I'm just tryna get used
To these changes
In the DM they claim save us
I see all the real shit
That face us
But these people say
Just entertain us
Just entertain us
Fuck it

Is this what you wanted?
We get drunk,
We get high
We talk pills until
The morning
We don't care,
We don't mind
Pretend everything
Is awesome
While the world
Burns outside
Is this what you wanted?
Is that what you wanted?

You wanna watch
Me melt, down
You wanna watch
Me drop, dead
You wanna see
Me sell my soul
Believe all the lies,
That I've been fed
You wanna watch
Me give up
You wanna see
Me sedated
You deserve all
You got coming
I am the thing you created

Is this what you wanted?
I'll get drunk, I'll get high
I'll pop pills until the morning
I don't care, I don't mind
Pretend everything is awesome
While the world burns outside
Is this what you wanted?

Pretend everything is awesome
While the world
Burns outside
Is this what you wanted?

Is this what you wanted?
We get drunk, we get high
We talk pills until the morning
We don't care, we don't mind
Pretend everything is awesome
While the world burns outside
Is this what you wanted?
Is that what you wanted?
