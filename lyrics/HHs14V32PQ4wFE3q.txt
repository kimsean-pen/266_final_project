Baby, don't you be blue
You know that I'll always be true
You know that I'll always love you
And we'll always be together, too

Over a thousand things I can say to you
Half of which would be untrue
But the one thing for sure I can say
Is that I won't fall in love today

Baby when you hold me tight
You know everything will be alright
So let's not take any time to fight
Because I love you with all my might

Over a thousand things I can say to you
Half of which would be untrue
But the one thing for sure I can say
Is that I won't fall in love today

You make me feel like a man
When we're rolling in the sand
So come and take me by the hand
And do the things you know we can

Over a thousand things I can say to you
Half of which would be untrue
But the one thing for sure I can say
Is that I won't fall in love today, yeah
