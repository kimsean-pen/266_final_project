Dig deep, dig in deeper
You go where only fools fear to tread
You'll find devices to kill your master
Why not kill your maker instead
Leave it to the ones that own you
Leave it to the ones to disown you
Put your faith and trust in the dusk
Do what you must do

I'm getting edgy
For those departed
Left all alone
Left still forgotten

Miles to go and skies to fly
Hold back the day
Miles to go and skies to fly, it's darkest before the dawn
Miles to go and skies to fly
Hold back the day
Miles to go and skies to fly, it's darkest before the dawn

Claw hard from your casket
Six feet and getting deeper
Should the top-soil feel heavy
It must be getting weaker
Towers people build up in life
Become frail and fall to the ground
Fuck them, their opinion
Deceiving the honest man

I'm getting edgy
For those departed
Left all alone
Left still forgotten

Miles to go and skies to fly
Hold back the day
Miles to go and skies to fly, it's darkest before the dawn
Miles to go and skies to fly
Hold back the day
Miles to go and skies to fly, it's darkest before the dawn

Always, always darkest before the dawn
Always darkest before the dawn
Always darkest before the dawn
Always darkest before the...

I'm getting edgy
For those departed
Left all alone
Left still forgotten

Miles to go and skies to fly
Hold back the day
Miles to go and skies to fly, it's darkest before the dawn
Miles to go and skies to fly
Hold back the day
Miles to go and skies to (fly), it's darkest before the dawn
Darkest, darkest
Always, always darkest before the dawn
Always darkest before the dawn, always darkest, darkest
