I can see the path you're cutting
It cost me a little piece of my heart
I can see the doors you're shutting
'Cause they were open at the start
Baby, loving you has been hard on me
You're such a tough little sister
Just looking for Mr. Right
On the wrong side of town
You better love somebody
It's late
You better love somebody
Don't wait
You better love somebody
Don't tempt, fate
You're gonna pull it just a little too far
One night
Your eyes are wild, your skin's so white
You're undernourished and overfed
She's got the teeth, she knows how to bite
When you bit, I bled
You got the perfect image of the perfect man
You're a tough little sister
But you'll settle for a mister tonight
But you're running out of time
You better love somebody
It's late
You better love somebody
Don't wait
You better love somebody
Don't tempt fate
You're gonna pull you just a little too far
One night
I'm only saying what I feel
You think I'm wrong, I know
You thought I was sleeping at the wheel
I thought that you were driving

You better love somebody
You better love somebody
You better love somebody
It's late
You better love somebody
Don't wait
You better love somebody
Don't tempt, fate
They're gonna pull you just a little too far
One night
One night, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
One night, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
One night, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
One night, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
