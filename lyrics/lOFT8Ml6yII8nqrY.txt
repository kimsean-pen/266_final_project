Voices, they are calling my name
They never stop and it drives me insane
Even in sleep they torment my soul
My inner demons take all control

Slowly it's transforming me into a beast
Nails turn to claw and I got white fangs as teeth
The hundreds of voices inside my head
They will only stop the day I am dead

Voices, oh voices, leave me alone
Why are you inside me and torment my soul
Why don't you leave and let me be
Demons inside, get out, I beg thee

And let me be free
666 voices inside, telling me who's about to die
They are in control of my mind
666 demons inside, to kill them all only one must die

It is a shame it must be me
What have I done to deserve this hell
Am I better off dead or locked up in a padded cell?
I feel the demon's bloodlust slowly increase

Saying that next murder must be a masterpiece
Voices, oh voices, leave me alone
Why are you inside me and torment my soul?
Why don't you leave and let me be?

Demons inside, get out, i beg thee
Why don't you leave and let me be?
Demons inside, get out, i beg thee
666 voices inside, telling me that this one must die

They are in control of my mind
666 demons inside, I hear them rejoice when someone dies
But I am the one with blood on my hands
Why don't you leave and let me be?

Demons inside, get out, I beg thee
Why don't you leave and let me be?
Demons inside, get out, I beg thee
666 voices inside, telling me who's about to die

They are in control of my mind
666 demons inside, to kill them all only one must die
It is a shame it must be me
666 voices inside, telling me it is your turn to die

They are in control of my mind
666 demons inside
I hear them rejoice now when you die
A deed I commit, with a smile.
