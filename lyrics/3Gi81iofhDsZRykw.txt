I can feel it coming
I can feel you're changing
I feel it flip my stomach
I feel it from your breathing

It makes a difference to my life
My best friend said to me, "I love you"
It makes a difference to my life
You being around for me, it does too

I can feel it taking shape
You warm me up and make me safe
I can feel it taking shape
You warm me up I'm so glad you're okay

I care so much about what you're thinking
And it's tiring, tell me it's nothing
Well yeah I'd love to jump right in
But it's frightening, tell me it's nothing

It's like a different kind of memory
(being around)
The way you think and feel and sound and see
(being around)
I hope you're happy I really do

I can feel it taking shape
You warm me up and make me safe
I can feel it taking shape
You warm me up I'm so glad you're okay

It's like a different kind of memory
(being around)
I'll try and make it better
I get a little lost
