You got what it takes you can win...

You got what it takes you can win
Today is your day to begin
Don't give up here, don't you quit
The moment is now, this is it
I know that you can, then you will
Get to the top of the hill
Part of the fun is the climb
You just gotta make up your mind

That today is your day
And nothing can stand in your way
Today is your day
Everything's goin' your way

Today, today, today, today

When somebody throws sticks and stones
All they can break are your bones
And life's gonna kick you around
Then kick you again when you're down

But today is your day
And nothing can stand in your way
Today is your day
Everything's goin' your way

Today, today, today, today

Life's gonna kick you
It's gonna to kick you around

It's gonna to kick you down
Brush yourself off, no regrets
This is as good as it gets
Don't expect more, or less

Just go out and give it your best
Today is your day
And nothing can stand in your way
Today is your day
Everything's goin' your way
Today yeah
Today yeah today is your day
Today, today, I said today, today
Today is your day (mmm)
