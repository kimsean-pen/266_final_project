I see you looking at me like I got something that's for you
And the way that you stare, don't you dare 'cause I'm not about to
Just give it all up to you
'Cause there are some things I won't do
And I'm not afraid to tell you, I don't ever wanna leave you confused
The more you try, the less I buy it and
I don't have to think it through
You know if I'm into you
I don't need a man (To make it happen, I get off being free)

I don't need a man (To make me feel good, I get off doing my thing)
I don't need a ring (Around my finger)
To make me feel complete, so let me break it down
I can get off when you ain't around, oh!

You know I got my own life and I bought everything that's in it
So, if you wanna be with me it ain't all about the bling you bringing
I want a love that's for real
And without that then no deal
Baby, I don't need a hand if it only wants to grab one thing
The more you try, the less I buy it and
I don't have to think it through
You know if I'm feelin' you
I don't need a man (To make it happen, I get off being free)

I don't need a man (To make me feel good, I get off doing my thing)
I don't need a ring (Around my finger)
To make me feel complete, so let me break it down
I can get off when you ain't around, oh!
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go (Let It go)
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go (No, no, no, no)
Let it go, let it go, let it go

I don't need a
I don't need a man, I don't
I don't need a man, I'll get me through
'Cause I know I'm fine, I feel brand new

I don't need a
I don't need a man, I don't
I don't need a man, I'll make it through
'Cause I know I'm fine without you!
I don't need a man (To make it happen, I get off being free)
I don't need a man (To make me feel good, I get off doing my thing)
I don't need a ring (Around my finger)
To make me feel complete, so let me break it down

I can get off when you ain't around, oh!
I don't need a man (I'm over you, yeah)
I don't need a man (Oh oh, I'm over you)
I don't need a man
I'm without you
I'm over you
Oh!
I don't need a man
I don't need a man (I don't need cha, I don't need cha know!)
I don't need a man
Oh!
