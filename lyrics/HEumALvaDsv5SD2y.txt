Hollywood looking good like a dead man should
Your hair is white, your teeth are black
You had a heart attack
All I know is that you're not coming back
All I know is that you're not coming back
Hollywood, never looked so good as
when it was all burning down in flames
Don't you think it's lame we all die the
same and that fire's gonna cleanse this Earth
Fire's gonna burn us all away
You wish this night would last forever, and so I do
We'll watch the world pass by in embers, they fill the sky
All the black and burning earth, feel the fire giving birth
To this moment that we've cast in amber, don't turn away
Hollywood, never looked so good as
when it was all burning down in flames
Don't you think is lame we all die the
same and that fire's gonna cleanse this Earth
Hollywood, never looked so good as
when it was all burning down in flames
Don't you think it's lame we all die the
same and fire's gonna cleanse this Earth
Fire's gonna burn us all away
Fire's gonna cleanse this Earth, fire's gonna burn this Earth
Fire's gonna burn us all away
