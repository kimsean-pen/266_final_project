we are all falling down
we are all falling
every word that you pray
makes another slave
every idol that you build
brings another plague
every cross that you bear
grows another grave
we are all falling down
we are all falling
down down down
we are all falling
under the weight
of our heartache
under the weight
of their mistakes
