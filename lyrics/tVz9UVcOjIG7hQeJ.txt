I'm not your stepping stone, no
I'm not your stepping stone

Here you're trying to make your mark on society
Using all the tricks that you used on me
You're reading all those high fashion magazines
The clothes you're wearin' lady causing public scenes

I said, "I'm not your stepping stone, no"
No, I'm not your stepping stone, no
Not your stepping stone, not your stepping stone
Not your stepping stone, not your stepping stone, no

I'm not your stepping stone
No, I'm not your stepping stone

When I first met you girl you didn't have no shoes
But now you're walking 'round like you're front page news
You've been awful careful 'bout the friends you choose
But you won't find my name in your book of who's who

I said, "I'm not your stepping stone", not me no
I said, "I'm not your stepping stone", no
Not your stepping stone, not stepping stone
Your stepping stone, not your stepping stone, no

Not your stepping stone, not stepping stone
Your stepping stone, oh, I'm not your stepping stone
Oh, baby I'm not your stepping stone
Not your stepping stone, no no no no, your stepping stone

No no, I'm not your stepping stone
Not your stepping stone, your stepping stone
Oh woah not your stepping stone
Stepping, stepping, stepping, stepping, stepping, stepping stone
Your stepping stone
