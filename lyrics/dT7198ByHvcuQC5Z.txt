I will promise myself I won't care
Distracting myself from your stare
And I've seen this mistake once before
With your games I will never fall for

I've hung up my guns
I won't kill again

I won't forget you
I won't forget you
I'm not gonna let you win
But I'm tired of lying

Tired of fighting you
And it's not gonna change
You asked for my heart

You know that I'm down
But not the way you lie to me
And tear it all apart
And beg for me to stay
I've sailed off to sea

I'm not coming back
I won't forget you

I won't forget you
I'm not gonna let you win
I'm not gonna
But I'm tired of the lying

Tired of fighting you
And it's not gonna change
Counting down

Make that sound
When know it makes no sense
Counting down

Till you mess around
And I know you can't ever change
Why I'm trembling?
Thrown overboard
When I'm ready to relive the past
Counting down

Make that sound
Break the silence
Pretend it's not forever

Ill pull myself together
Ill say that I'll forget her
Ill breathe
And I'll say she never hurt me

And look at it as learning
And laugh about the good and the bad
Because I won't live forever

We don't belong together
I know I'll feel better
One day when I can make it through
I won't forget you
I won't forget you
I'm not gonna let you win
I'm not gonna
But I'm tired of lying
Tired of fighting you
And it's not gonna change
I won't forget you
I'm not gonna let you win
I'm tired of the lying
Tired of fighting you
And it's not gonna change...
