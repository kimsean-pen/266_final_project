Come on, bore me
Tell me a little more about you
Come on and bore me please
Bore me, tell me what you think

I cannot believe
I got through a single day
Of my life without you

This all about me, this is not about you
This all about me, this is not about you
This all about me, this is not about you
This all about me, not you

Why every time I try, you never hear me
You only hear you
Why every time I try, I never get through
This all about me, not you
This time it's all about me, not you

Hey wait, I think I might have something to say
Hey wait, I think I might have something to add
Ain't it funny how when my opinion starts to spill
It falls on deaf ears

This all about me, this is not about you
This all about me, this is not about you
This all about me, this is not about you
This all about me, not you

Why every time I try, you never hear me
You only hear you
Why every time I try, I never get through
This all about me, not you

I pledge allegiance to myself
To me, myself and I, go

This all about me, this is not about you
This all about me, this is not about you
This all about me, this is not about you
This all about me, not you

Why every time I try, you never hear me
You always hear you
Why every time I try, I never get through
This all about me

Why every time I try, you never hear me
You always hear you
Why every time I try, I never get through
This all about me, not you
This time it's all about me, not you

I pledge allegiance to myself
To me, myself and I
I pledge allegiance to myself
To me, myself and I
