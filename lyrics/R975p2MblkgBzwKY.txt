Wafer thin
The waif is in
She's chlorine clean and portion fed
Feed the dog
Slop the hog
Shine the Baptist and debark the log

It's all right, I know
You're the only one who can
Show us at all

Get it done
Circulate
What I hear, fear motivates
So intense
So sensitive
In your head where fashion lives

It's all right, I know
You're the only one who can
Show us at all

It's ok, I know
You're mean and hard and bored
It's always something
