Make it a sweet, sweet goodbye
It could be for the last time and it's not right
"Don't let yourself get in over your head", he said
"Alone and far from home I'll find you"

Sad like a candle you burnt out
Spill the wax over the spaces left in place of angry words
Scream to be heard like you needed any more attention
Throw the bottle, break the door and disappear

Sing me to sleep
I'll see you in my dreams
Waiting to say, "I miss you, I'm so sorry"

Forever's never seemed so long as when you're not around
It's like a piece of me is missing
I could have learned so much from you but what's left now?
Don't you realize you showed this family a world of pain?
Can't you see this could have been a happy ending we let go?

Sing me to sleep
I'll see you in my dreams
Waiting to say, "I miss you, I'm so sorry"

Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep

Sing me to sleep
(You've taken so much with you)
I'll see you in my dreams
(But left the worst with me?)
Waiting to say, "I miss you, I'm so sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry"
