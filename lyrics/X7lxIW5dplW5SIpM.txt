Deep in the heart of Germany
Lucy clutched her breast in fear
She heard a beat of her lover's heart
For weeks she raved in dreams he appeared
From far off Transylvania

Only a woman can break his spell
Pure in heart, who will offer herself
To Nosferatu?

This ship pulled in without a sound
The faithful captain long since cold
He kept his log 'til the bloody end
Last entry read "Rats in the hold
My crew is dead, I fear the plague"

Only a woman can break his spell
Pure in heart, who will offer herself?

Mortal terror reigned
Sickness now, then horrible death
Only Lucy knew the truth
And at her window
Nosferatu

So chaste, so calm, she gave herself
To the pleasure of the dreaded master
He sucked the precious drops of life
Throughout the long and cold, dark night

One last goodbye, he was blinded by love
One last goodbye, he was blinded by love
Blinded by love

He screamed with fear, he'd stayed too long in her room
The morning sun had come too soon
The spell was broken with a kiss of doom
He vanished into dust, left her all alone

Only a woman can break his spell
Pure in heart, who will offer herself

Only a woman can break his spell
Pure in heart, who will offer herself
To Nosferatu?
