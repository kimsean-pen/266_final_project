The tape across your mouth says more
than your words ever could
You're squirming and screaming
as I tease your eyes
with glowing needles

Crawl slug
drag your shattered legs behind
I know no matter how much I hurt you
She'll always love you more than me
But all of this isn't for the sake of her love
it's for the sake of my jealousy
