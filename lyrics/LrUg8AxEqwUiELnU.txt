The day you came
Naked, afraid

Young mother screams and pushes you
The day you came

Oh joy begin
Weak little thing
More precious there'll be nothing, no
Oh joy begin

Let's not forget these early days
Remember we begin the same
We lose our way in fear and pain
Oh joy begin

First just one step
One word and then
With laughter sing, oh life begin
First just one step

Let's not forget these early days
Remembering we began the same
We lose our way in fear and pain
Oh joy begin

Innocent kiss
Black magic bliss
First broken bone
Sudden and swift
Oh innocence

Let's not forget these early days
Remember we begin the same
We lose our way in fear and pain
Oh joy begin
Oh joy begin
