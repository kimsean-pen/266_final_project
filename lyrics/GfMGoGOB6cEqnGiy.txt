This city drinks and roars
Each word so meaningless
Each word, especially yours, echoes inside my head

Why can't you see
I won't let you get your way
Let you get the best of me
I just need to know
Are you done with me?

So are you done with me?
And if you are won't you just let me be?
Don't you understand your reasons for believing?
I cannot believe it

This city drinks and screams
This night will never end
This city made of dreams
My dreams have turned to sand

Why can't you see
I won't let you get your way
Let you get the best of me
I just need to know

So are you done with me?
And if you are won't you just let me be
Don't you understand your reasons for believing?
I cannot believe it

So are you done with me?
Are you honestly?
Did you realize that I can't be all you need
Are you done with me?
Are you honestly?
If love is gone, then I am done again

So are you done with me?
And if you are won't you just let me be?
Don't you understand your reasons for believing?
I cannot believe it

So are you done with me?
And if you are won't you just let me be?
Don't you understand your reasons for believing?
I cannot believe it

This city drinks and roars
