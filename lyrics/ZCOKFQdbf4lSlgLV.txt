Quiet, how quiet is the night
Someone switched me off, but now I'm back

Move, take your bag and start to run
There is someone hiding in the dark

Black, there is nothing I can do
Someone grabbed my arm and it was you
Why, why you're running here my boy
Come, I will take you to your home

Brave, take your things and follow me
I cannot follow something I can't see
Sing, I will sing for you instead
This song is only thing that can't be dead
Rain, I can feel it on my skin
The drops are falling slowly to my chin
And now I open up my eyes
The dream is changing and I'm not surprised
