sorry that was out of the blue, all those thing that i had told you.
i dont blame you if your feeling confused, i would too, i would too.
learning how untie that noose, properly groove by groove.
on your lips i taste the regret, as we lay there in a cold sweat.
and the floor tiles they feel just like, all the thoughts that i thought i'd find.
the actions and reflex, the moments in context. what we did to please them, the reasons, the reasons...
and hayley she got caught in a mess, shes got the next 5 weeks planned out paycheck to paycheck, saving for the great exodus, and then it will all make sense, we'll make sense of this mess,
and i just think its unfair, the way you like to say that i dont care or im not there when im still here, and every time we fight how it goes there.
and i just want you to know/ that when you left i really wanted to follow. i know i lied. i know what i said. i dont know why.
we're never coming back to this place,
(take you all can! take all you can carry!)
but i just cant leave you this way,
were too young, its too entrapping to stay,
(i'll take all your hurt! i'll take all your hurt and carry it with me!)
i think youll understand some day, but for now you just say
i keep "swimming away from your love".
and the facts do prevail: yes i do make it tough
and i keep "swimming away from your love".
and i know that is nothing that youve never heard,
but i fucked up the process when i said those words.
think its too late, then i hear your voice through the phone,
say "aint it nice to fuck up, and not be in it alone?"
yea, aint it nice to fuck up, and not be in it alone?
aint it nice to fuck up and not be in it alone?
