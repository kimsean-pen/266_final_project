Woah-oah, hm-hmm

You've been running 'round, running 'round, running 'round
Throwing that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up

You've been going 'round, going 'round, going 'round
Every party in L.A.
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd be at one

I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking about when you were mine, oh
And now I'm all up on you, what'd you expect?
But you're not coming home with me tonight

You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never getting over you, oh, you, oh

You've been running 'round, running 'round, running 'round
Throwing that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up

Baby, now that we're, now that we're, now that we're
Right here standing face to face
You already know, 'ready know, 'ready know that you won, oh

I know that dress is karma (dress is karma)
Perfume regret (yeah)
You got me thinking about when you were mine
(You got me thinking about when you were mine)

And now I'm all up on you (all up on you)
What'd you expect? (oh, baby)
But you're not coming home with me tonight, oh, no

You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new ('one new)
Yeah, you just want attention (oh)
I knew from the start (the start)
You're just making sure I'm never getting over you, oh

What are you doing to me? What are you doing, love?
