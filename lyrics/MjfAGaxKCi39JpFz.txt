Total rule with a broken psyche
No place for unity
Lost all will for a compromise
Total failure, complete demise
Defeated, misguided hatred
Feeble tales of a dying nation
I'll kill your pride before I die

Our days of peace died with your soul
A living breathing hoax, hungry for control
You've made your stance, staked your claim
Now it's time you join the toll
Pure fury devours you whole

It's time I fight back
I can't believe that you walked among me
My flesh, my blood
You're just the dirt below my feet

Our days of peace died with your soul
A living breathing hoax, hungry for control
You've made your stance, staked your claim
Now it's time you join the toll
Pure fury devours you whole

I'll rip your heart from your goddamn chest
You'll feel true revenge
I'll go to war just to bring you down
Your words will drown

I am pure goddamn fury
I will devour you whole
