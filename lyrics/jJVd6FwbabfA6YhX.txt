In nomine veritas
In nomine filii et patris
In nomine veritas
et sanctus: Amen and Attack!!!

Stand and call against the storm and hail the crucified:
Eins, Zwei! Amen and attack!
Far beyond the bibles army send us trough the night:
Drei, Vier! Amen and attack!

Sanctus, Deum dili Sacram, Domicile, Aus seu Amen!

When the night is cold and black, we sing Amen and Attack
and we lead the Storm of the wild!
Be the wildest of the pack, screaming Amen and Attack
and we fight with God on our side!
Amen and Attack!
Attack
Attack
Amen and Attack!
Attack!

Fight the demons of this world, no victims left to hide:
Eins, Zwei! Amen and attack!
Make them pray or make them pay, its time to stand up right:
Drei, Vier! Amen and attack!

Sanctus, Deum dili Sacram, Domicile, Aus seu Amen!

When the night is cold and black: We sing Amen and Attack
and We lead the storm of the wild!
Be the wildest of the pack:
screaming Amen and Attack
and We fight with God on our side
Amen and Attack!

Attack!
Attack!
Amen and Attack!
Attack!
