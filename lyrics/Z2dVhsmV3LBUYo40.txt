Oh yes

Well looky here, looks here
Ah, what do we have?
Another pretty thang ready for me to grab
But little does she know that I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
'Cause at the end of the night, it is her I'll be holding

I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me, Baby, baby, please dont go away
But when I play, I never stay
So every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say

Run, run, runaway, runaway, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, get away, get away, darlin'
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rollin' stone
So you better run, run, runaway, runaway, baby

Well, let me think, let me think
Ah, what should I do?
So many eager young bunnies that I'd like to persue
Now even though they eatin' out the palm of my hand
There's only one carrot and they all gotta share it

I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me, Baby, baby, please dont go away
But when I play, I never stay
So every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say

Run, run, runaway, runaway, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, get away, get away, darlin'
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rollin' stone
So you better run, run, runaway, runaway, baby

See, I ain't trynna' hurt you, baby, no, no
No, I just wanna work you, baby, yup, yup
See, I ain't trynna' hurt you, baby, no, no
No, I just wanna work you, baby
If you scared you better run
You scared you better run
You scared you better run
You better, you better, you better

Run, run, runaway, runaway, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, get away, get away, darlin'
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rollin' stone
So you better run, run, runaway, runaway, baby
