Now don't go walking towards the light, life is only finite, finite... yeah
You know we love to play with fire, burning up the cold nights, the cold nights... yeah
In and out of breath I'm staring into death, lay down with the liar
Chemical effect, we're falling neck to neck, the page and the writer
Now don't go walking towards the light, life is only finite, finite... yeah
You know we love to play with fire, burning up the cold nights, the cold nights... yeah
Get back, your words mean nothing to me, maybe a relapse is what I need
Lost love, no coming back for me, finite grip to your sanity
In and out of this stress and make another mess, the things we desire
Running through my chest, the right lung and the left, no way to go higher
Now don't go walking towards the light, life is only finite, finite... yeah
You know we love to play with fire, burning up the cold nights, the cold nights... yeah
Get high and pretend like I'm just not here
Middle fingers to the sky, once you die, hope you realize
Fucked up and pretend like I'm just not here
Middle fingers to the sky, once you die, it's a suicide
If all these dreams come pouring back to me
Don't say I didn't leave my mind

It's all a dream, I'm standing on my feet
I said I wouldn't miss your eyes
Now don't go walking towards the light, life is only finite, finite... yeah
You know we love to play with fire, burning up the cold nights, the cold nights... yeah

If all these dreams come pouring back to me
It's only finite, finite
It's all a dream, I'm standing on my feet
Burning up the cold nights, the cold nights
If you do what you have to realize yet
stop your ... don't come back to me again
Lost nerve, no coming back for me
Finite
