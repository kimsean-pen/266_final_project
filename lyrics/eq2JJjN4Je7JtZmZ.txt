I saw you drifting through the street glaze
The victim you've become
I have never seen a shape so vaguely formed
You've been running for the light boy
You've drawn out your escape
But do you even have the will to let light in?

All that will scare you, all that you fear to find
Is caught in a fire you cannot leave behind

I saw you covering your murder
Your self-immunity fails
Your eager soul is growing eyes upon itself
It's all a trick with the tail boy
Feel free to make a blur
There's still an honesty in knowing when to lie

I'm strangely comfortable hanging with my head down
As if the laws of human physics are removed
Today I know that I will do no harm
I have been paralyzed by motion draining images emerging from your face

All that will scare you, all that you fear to find
Is caught in a fire you cannot leave behind
All that she told you, words that you fear to find
Caught in a fire you cannot leave behind
