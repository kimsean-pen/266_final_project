Cheated by
The opposite of love
Held on high
From up up up above
Kept my high
From the second one
Kept my eye
On the first one

Now take these rings
And stow them safe away
I'll wear them on
Another rainy day
Take these rings
And stow them safe away
I'll wear them on
Another rainy day

Take these rings
And stow them safe away
I'll wear them on
Another rainy day
Take these rings
And stow them safe away
I'll wear them on
Another rainy day

Well I'm
Take-take-take-take-takin' it off
And she's
Take-take-take-take-takin' it off
And he's
Take-take-take-take-takin' it off
And we're
Take-take-take-take-takin' it off

Sometimes
I think that I'm bigger
Than the sound
I think that I'm bigger
Than the sound
I think that I'm bigger
than the sound
I think that I'm bigger
Than the sound

She'll take on high
She'll take on high-igh

Well sometimes
I think that I'm bigger
Than the sound
I think that I'm bigger
Than the sound
I think that I'm bigger
Than the sound
Well I think that I'm bigger
Than the sound

Take these rings
And stow them safe away
I'll wear them on

Now take these rings
And stow them safe away
I'll wear them on
Another rainy day
Take these rings
And stow them safe away
I'll wear them on
Another rainy day
