You make me feel real
You make me feel real
You make me feel real
You make me feel real

I can see my power
Living in the lights
Without one another
In this state of minds

Invisible forces
Holding us together
Invisible forces
Nothing else between us

You make me feel real
You make me feel real
You make me feel real
You make me feel real

I can see my power
Living in the lights
Without one another
In this state of minds

Invisible forces
Holding us together
Invisible forces
Nothing else between us
