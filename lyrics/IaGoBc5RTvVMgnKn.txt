Wait, dear
The time is getting late here
I'm all washed up in grace
With faint applause
Dressed in a cheap fa√ßade
I'm looking for a place I'll never see again

A night turns to a day
A street I've never walked on
I was never here
I'm just a faint reflection
The day turns to a month
A second of affection
I was never here
I'm just a faint reflection

Faking
There's nothing here worth taking
Just my reflection fading
On the wall
Not the fairest one of all
I'm looking for a place I'll never see again

The night turns to a day
A street I've never walked on
I was never here
I'm just a faint reflection
The day turns to a month
A second of affection
I was never here
I'm just a faint reflection

The night turns to a day
A street I've never walked on
I was never here
I'm just a faint reflection
The day turns to a month
A second of affection
I was never here
I'm just a faint reflection
