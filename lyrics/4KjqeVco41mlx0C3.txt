Here it comes and then it goes
And that feeling takes me home
And I don't know where I'm goin', let it flow

All I wanted was a taste
Just enough to waste the day
Just enough to make me sick, let it flow

And it takes up all my time
And it lays me back a while
Makes me feel like I'm a child
Let it flow, let it flow

Here it comes and then it goes
And it hits me, takes me home
I don't know where I'm goin'
And I don't know where I've been

But I'd do it all again
All I wanted was a taste
Enough to waste a day
Just enough to make me sick
I can't get too much of it

Here it comes and then it goes
And it hits me, takes me home
I don't know where I'm goin'
And I don't know where I've been

And I'd do it all again
I'd do it all again
I'd do it all again

I'd do it all again
I'd do it all again
I'd do it all again
