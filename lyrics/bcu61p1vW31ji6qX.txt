I woke up weak today and needing your voice
Crawled into the speakers and turned up the volume
Felt so sick today but cured by your noise
My head in the speakers is drowning out volumes

In "Ashes To Ashes" I'm falling falling
In "Ashes To Ashes" I'm losing losing
In "Curl" and "Grazes" I'm feeling feeling
In "Curl" and "Grazes" I'm losing losing

Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn me on

I dress up bright tonight and needing the beat
Dance into the speakers and max up the volume
Feel so high tonight and moved by my feet
My heart in the speakers is loving the volume

In "Pretty Vacant" I'm jumping jumping
In "Pretty Vacant" I'm moving moving
In "Teaches Of Peaches" I'm speeding speeding
In "Teaches Of Peaches" I'm moving moving

Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn me on

In "Delia's Gone" "I'll Keep It With Mine" "Birdland" "Clouds"
In "Sous Le Soleil Exactement" "Sunshine Superman" "I Want You" "Ghosts"
In "Some Velvet Morning" "Paper Wings" "Virginia Avenue" "Laura"
In "Summer's Almost Over" "I Walk the Line" "A Night Like This" "Strange Fruit"

In "Hatful Of Hollow" I'm diving diving
In "Hatful Of Hollow" I'm screaming screaming
In "Boys" and "Voodoo" I'm living living
In "Boys" and "Voodoo" I'm screaming screaming

Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up
Turn me on!
