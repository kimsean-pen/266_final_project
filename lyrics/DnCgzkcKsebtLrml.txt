All those things I ever thought would never end
To think they're now all memories sends me round the bend
Watch the airplane swaying, coming in to land
Then my world is hanging in someone else's hands
And if I've done something, you have to let me go
Think of me as someone, someone that you know
But if I don't hear something pretty soon from now
I'll disconnect completely, see how that works out

I wasn't daring not much a chancer
Oh my darling, why won't you answer?
Seven AM, midnight in Dover
Sun's coming up now, I guess it's over
Playing his guitar while he's dying of cancer
Oh my father, why won't you answer?
Seven AM, midnight in Dover
Suns comin up now, I guess it's over
