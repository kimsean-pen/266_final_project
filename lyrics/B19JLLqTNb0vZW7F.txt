My darling, trust in me
And we will make a wish
My darling, don't be scared
From nightmares I'll be there

So please are we
Let your dreams set you free
Honey please don't speak
You'll be safe

Don't you worry babe so go to sleep
And save your tears
I know the dreamer last within
Let's wish to fly
Just you and I
So close your eyes to stop your cries
Baby go to sleep
Oh oh baby go to sleep
Oh oh baby go to sleep

My sweartheart, my true love
Fly through the night
Let her shine
Oh, My sweatheart, my true love
It's time to sail through all the land
So please don't speak
You'll be safe

Don't you worry babe so go to sleep
And save your tears
I know the dreamer last within
Lets wish to fly
Just you and I
So close your eyes to stop your cries
Baby go to sleep
Oh oh baby go to sleep
Oh oh baby go to sleep
