What's the sense in sharing, this one and only life
endin' up, just another lost and lonely wife
you'll count up the years, and they will be filled with tears
love only breaks up, to start over again
you'll get the baby, but you won't have your man
while he is busy loving every woman that he can, uh-huh
say i'm gonna leave a hundred times a day
it's easier said than done
when you just can't break away (when you just can't break away)
Oh young hearts run free
never be hung up, hung up like my man and me, my man and me
ooh, young hearts, to yourself be true
don't be no fool when love really don't love you, don't love you
It's high time now just one crack at life
who wants to live in, in trouble and strife
my mind must be free, to learn all i can about me, uh-hmm
I'm gonna love me, for the rest of my days
encourage the babies every time they say
"self preservation is what's really going on today"
Say i'm gonna turn loose a thousand times a day
but how can i turn loose
when i just can't break away (when i just can't break away)
Oh young hearts run free
they'll never be hung up, hung up like my man and me, you and me
ooh, young hearts, to yourself be true
don't be no fool when love really don't love you, don't love you
