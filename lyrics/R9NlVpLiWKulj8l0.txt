Touch me
Come on and touch me now
I need to feel human again
I'm feeling so strange in my skin
Catch it in your hands while you can
Come on baby try it.
Catch it in your hands while you can
Come on you should try it.
Come on baby, dance with me.
I don't care if we make a scene.
I want to feel the space between
Come on baby, dance with me.
Dance with me.
Dance with me.
Try me.
Come on and try me now
It's tension and chemistry
It's something you can and can't see now
Catch it your hands while you can.
Come on baby try it.
Ohhh
Catch it in your hands while you can
Ohh
Come on you should try it.
Come on baby, dance with me.
I don't care if we make a scene.
I want to fill the space between.
Come on baby, dance with me.
I feel you.
I feel you move me.
Say you do
Say that you feel me move you
Come on baby, dance with me.
I don't care if we make a scene.
I want to feel the space between.
Come on baby, dance with me.
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Oh! Dance with me.
