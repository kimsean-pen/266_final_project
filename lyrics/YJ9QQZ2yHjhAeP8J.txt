I just want you to know that throught out it all
It's only you that stuck by me
And for that, I thank you, I love you
Ashanti
(Ashanti!)

Ooh, I can't wait to get next to you
Oh, I just can't leave you alone

Boy, you got me doing things that I would never do
And I can't stop the way I'm feeling if I wanted to
I'm crazy 'bout the way that you could make me say your name
And if I couldn't have you, I would probably go insane, 'cause

Only you can make me feel
And only you can take me there
And only you can make me feel
And only you can take me there

Ooh, I can't wait to get next to you
Oh, I just can't leave you alone

Boy, you stay inside my mind, ain't no denying that
And only you could do them things that got me coming back
It gotta be the realest thing that I have ever felt
And I'll do what I gotta do to keep you to myself, 'cause

Only you can make me feel
And only you can take me there
And only you can make me feel
And only you can take me there

Crazy (crazy)
'Bout the ('bout the)
Way you (make me)
Feel
I just (I just)
Gotta (gotta)
Have you (have you)
Here
And I (and I)
Wanna (wanna)
Let you (let you)
Know
I won't (I won't)
Ever (ever)
Let you (let you)
Go

Only you can make me feel
And only you can take me there
And only you can make me feel
And only you can take me there

Ooh, I can't wait to get next to you
Oh, I just can't leave you alone
