I ran to dance in white light vision release
Untie the outline you
Shape was lost too bright
Beautiful burnt retina

Ah, fall, we just 抗Ezu

Deception 5 seconds or so hours
In the combustion Yosoou
The signs of slipping his arm was certainly in the speed of sound

I ran to dance in white light vision release
Untie the outline you
Shape was lost too bright
Beautiful burnt retina

Ah, the flare appears to cut through the landscape

Gently worn away 色付Kanai Afterimage
Show your eyes to see the wings Furuwaseta Furuwaseta
Heating disappeared

Even the blue sky high above the go
Untie the outline you
What I do not mind the burnt-out broken
Beautiful burnt retina

White light to dance away the sight 放列
Untie the outline you
Shape was lost too bright
Beautiful burnt retina
