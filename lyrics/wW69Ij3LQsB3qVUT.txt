What do I say
They told me that I'm too much to handle
I've gotten way too fucking carried away,
And damn it's a shame
These fuckers had the best of me and they blew it
I'm running circles around the pussies they made
I don't even care if I'm late
And I will never make the mistake of letting some
Crooked motherfuckers steal the life from every one of my veins
How many times do I have to fight to prove
Something that's already standing here in plain sight?
Maybe if you ever looked
You'd see more than everything they want you to see
And maybe if its not enough
Someone else will take the crown, if ever I leave
They never question when I say a thing
They know it's coming so they move aside and take their place
It's always different when it's face to face
Don't fucking question what you've never seen or had to chase
Look alive, look alive, you're barren
There's not a fight, no insight worth giving
How do you feel?
And do you even feel this at all
With no words to say?
Dismembered every frame
Locked out and now the close minded make their claims
Do you even see me now?
Are my conclusions profound?
Start new every day, until you make it perfect in every way
What's left in me
Guess we'll see
Didn't see this coming
What's left in me
Left in me
What's left in me
Guess we'll see
Didn't see this coming
What's left in me
Left in me
What's left in me
Guess we'll see
Didn't see this coming
What's left in me
Left in me
