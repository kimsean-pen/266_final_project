In a world policed by children
In a game of fame and power
We forget it's all a program
We're in too far to tell

So convinced we're making progress, it's a lie
We divide ourselves to collide

Alien angel
Alien, alien
Alien angel
Alien, alien
Alien angel

We knock heads about the answers
We protest and guess and judge
We need an off-world enemy concept
Someone far away to loathe

Can you convince us that this
Spaceship should survive?
We divide ourselves to collide

Alien angel
Alien, alien
Alien angel
Alien, alien

I feel infinite, but how high am I?
Guilty, yeah, but of what type of crime?
Loan the tools, maybe we'll wake up
Tune the fork to our frustration

Alien angel
Alien, alien
Alien angel
Alien, alien
Alien angel
