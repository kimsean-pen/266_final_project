Hands in the air like I don't care
Running free, just being me
Going nowhere
We're lying down side by side
Don't make a sound, enjoy the ride
G-Going nowhere
ohhh oh oohh oh
ohhhh oh ooooh

I close my eyes, you touch my thigh
We're holding hands, cancel plans
Going nowhere
Took me with you, a dream come true
Don't tell a lie or it's goodbye
We ain't going nowhere
ohhh oh oohh oh
ohhhh oh ooooh

What goes around, somehow comes back around
You hold the crown and now we ain't going nowhere, nowhere
I feel something different every moment that I'm with ya
Like Summer in November, everything yo do is brilliant
You're mine, we ain't going nowhere, nowhere
ohhh oh oohh oh
ohhhh oh ooooh
