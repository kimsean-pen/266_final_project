Yeah, another night out
I get drunk, I get high
Then you call and I lie
And I say I'm on my way now
Yeah, I say I'm on my way now

Show up when it's lights out
When you're dressing for work
And I'm mumbling words
I don't know what to say now
No, I don't know what to say now

You tell me I don't care
Tell me I never try
I said I'm sorry
Maybe a million times
It's gonna hurt you
If I don't say goodbye
You don't believe me
You don't believe me

I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want
What I'm gonna put you through

I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want
What I'm gonna put you through

Oh oh oh no baby
Oh oh oh no baby
Oh oh oh oh baby
You don't want
What I'm gonna put you through

Ah, parties with shots and powder
But, you rather sleep eight hours
And I know you got your doubts
'Cause I can't turn this life around, baby

Thought it was just a phase
Till I woke up a thousand days later
Realizing I'm the same
As I was before I saw your face

You tell me I don't care
Tell me I never try
I said I'm sorry
Maybe a million times

It's gonna hurt you
If I don't say goodbye
You don't believe me
You don't believe me

I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want
What I'm gonna put you through

I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you
You don't want
What I'm gonna put you through

Oh oh oh no baby
Oh oh oh no baby
Oh oh oh oh baby
You don't want
What I'm gonna put you through

Oh oh oh no baby
Oh oh oh no baby
Oh oh oh oh baby
I just want the best for you

You tell me I don't care
Tell me I never try
I said I'm sorry
Maybe a million times

It's gonna hurt you
If I don't say goodbye
You don't believe me
You don't believe me

I just want the best for you
I just want the best for you
But I'm just not the best for you (for you)
You don't want
What I'm gonna put you through
I just want the best for you (just want the best for you)
I just want the best for you (just want the best for you)
But I'm just not the best for you (I'm not the best for you)
You don't want
What I'm gonna put you through

Oh oh oh no baby
Oh oh oh no baby
Oh oh oh oh baby
You don't want
What I'm gonna put you through

Oh oh oh no baby (yeah)
Oh oh oh no baby (yeah)
Oh oh oh oh baby
I just want the best for you

I just want the best for you, ooh
