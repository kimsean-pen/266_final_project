"so what are you waiting for?
don't try to blow up you're never gonna make it,
its time grow up and learn how to fake it"
i know, I'm no genius
but when you say those things it makes me feel so dumb
so dumb

but if you ask me
I'm only 17
and no one has to hate me
but they carry on

as far as i see
you can't unbury me
so why can't i just make this ditch my home?

so what am i waiting for?
the girls on the street don't smile at me
i mean you'd think i wasn't cool before
i know, I KNOW
I'm no genius
but I just want to sleep and sing my songs
my song

but if you ask me
I'm only 17
and no one has to hate me
still they carry on

from what i can see
you can't unbury me
so I'm just going to make this ditch my home
