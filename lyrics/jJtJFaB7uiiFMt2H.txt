There's a part of me
That's lying underneath
That wants to see the darker side
Nothing I won't try
Once or maybe twice
Are you down to take the ride?
Living so naive, never going deep
Ain't a pill I could swallow, swallow, yeah
Taking off the edge, all I'm asking is
Will you be there to follow?
So down, hit ground when I'm going low
Tell me anywhere I go you will follow
Go round, all out when I lose control
Tell me anywhere I go you will follow
Follow, follow, follow...
Tell me anywhere I go you will follow
Tell me anywhere I go you will follow
Follow, follow, follow...
Tell me anywhere I go you will follow
Don't wanna put this wrong
I know I'm coming strong
But I can't get this off my mind
Imagine you and me
Or you and me and she
Where do you go when you run wild?
Living so naive, never going deep
Ain't a pill I could swallow, swallow, yeah
Taking off the edge, all I'm asking is
Will you be there to follow?
So down, hit ground when I'm going low
Tell me anywhere I go you will follow
Go round, all out when I lose control
Tell me anywhere I go you will follow
Tell me anywhere I go you will follow
Follow, follow, follow...
Tell me anywhere I go you will follow
Tell me anywhere I go you will follow
