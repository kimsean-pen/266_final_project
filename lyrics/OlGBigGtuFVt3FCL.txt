The kids in the street
They all know what to do
They're used to it
Like it ain't nothing new
One day they're gonna run your country too

Baffled by your living conditions
How we left them like this beats me please listen
I don't want a feud
It's rude
It's rude
It's you

I live outside two tower blocks
Filled with people who ran out of luck
But they still get by
It drains me like a battery
We settled for simplicity
But we all get by

Taking it all
Taking it all from me
Can't you see
Can you see they're struggling
Don't you know they need a break too

Don't look at me like I know what to do
I'm used to it like it ain't nothing new
Karma's gonna find its way back to you

I live outside two tower blocks
Filled with people who ran out of luck
But they still get by
It drains me like a battery
We settled for simplicity
But we all get
All get
High

All get high

I live outside two tower blocks
Filled with people who ran out of luck
But they still get by
It drains me like a battery
We settled for simplicity
But we all get by

It drains me like a battery
We settled for simplicity
But we all get
We all get
By
