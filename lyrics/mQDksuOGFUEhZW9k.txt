Can you take this broken boy
And put the pieces back as one?
Though he has all of his toys
He is never having fun

Because it's not enough
Now we're growing up
We ain't giving up
We're moving on
Because it's not enough
We were growing up
We ain't giving up
And I won't hear what you say so

Save your sympathy
Who'd ya think you're fooling, everything is dead
Now you welcome me to a town called hypocrisy
Save your sympathy
Who'd ya think you're fooling, everything is dead
Now you welcome me to a town called hypocrisy

(Town called hypocrisy)

Can you take this lonely girl
And pick her up from off the ground?
'Cause there's no pride to be found
When you follow sheep around
And no future here, no future for us in this town

Because it's not enough
Now we're growing up
We ain't giving up
We're moving on
Because it's not enough
We were growing up
We ain't giving up
And I won't hear what you say so

Save your sympathy
Who'd ya think you're fooling, everything is dead
Now you welcome me to a town called hypocrisy
Save your sympathy
Who'd ya think you're fooling, everything is dead
Now you welcome me to a town called hypocrisy

Because it's not enough
Now we're growing up
We ain't giving up
We're moving on
Because it's not enough
We were growing up
We ain't giving up
And I won't hear what you say so

Save your sympathy
Who'd ya think you're fooling, everything is dead
Now you welcome me to a town called hypocrisy
Save your sympathy
Who'd ya think you're fooling, everything is dead
Now you welcome me to a town called hypocrisy
