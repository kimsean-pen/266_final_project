And I'll run to you when the waters rise
And I'll run to you if the bombs ignite
I'll still call to you if I lose my sight
And I'll fall for you if you need a fight
Hammering on a glass floor
Rapping on a black door
Don't know what it's all for
Don't want it anymore

And I'll run to you when the waters rise
And I'll run to you if the bombs ignite
I'll still call to you if I lose my sight
And I'll fall for you if you need a fight

Using all that we can
Dominating all the land
Terrified it's going to end
How do we come back again?

And we know the whole while all that's good
All our past and problems understood
If only we would act now as we could
We would come to know our falsehood

And I'll run to you when the waters rise
And I'll run to you if the bombs ignite
I'll still call to you if I lose my sight
And I'll fall for you if you need a fight

And I'll run to you when the waters rise
And I'll run to you if the bombs ignite
I'll still call to you if I do go blind
And I'll be all for you if you lose the fight
