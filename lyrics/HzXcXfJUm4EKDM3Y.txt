When I was twelve I thought I'd be
King of the world by twenty three
Aye aye
But then one day I closed my eyes
And found a world that lives inside
Now I...

I feel free

I'm in a maze, you'd be amazed
How deep it's getting day by day
Aye aye
It never stops it never ends
But it's Okay cause I've got friends
That's why.

I feel free, no walls around me
I feel, I feel, I feel free

No walls around me
No rules to break or bend
I hope tonight don't end
I hope tonight don't end

Peculiarly I found a theme
That's ringing out inside my dreams
Aye aye
Its like the echo of a song
Sung before the world 'got born'
Now I.

It's hypnotised me
Lit the lights inside me
Now I don't recognise me.
Aye, aye, aye.

I feel free, no walls around me
I feel, I feel, I feel free

No walls around me
No rules to break or bend
I hope tonight don't end
I hope tonight don't end
