Back in a younger day
Stead fast naivety
I heard a sound from you
A light lit up the room
It'd be a lie to say
I woulndn't wait all day
Oh, this is something new
This is feeling...
Let's try to know each other
In a new and exciting way
I'll be back when dinner's over
If I still will see your name
Let's try to know each other
In a new and exciting way
I'll be back when dinner's over
If I still will see your name
•••
You're with me on my way
All day and all night
Too much of a good thing
We realize such is life
It'd be a lie to say
That I would wait today
Oh, This is nothing new
Are We feeling?

Let's try to know each other
In a new and exciting way
I'll be back when dinner's over
If I still will see your name
Let's try to get know each other
In a new and exciting way
I'll be back when dinner's over
If I still will see your name

Let's try to know each other
