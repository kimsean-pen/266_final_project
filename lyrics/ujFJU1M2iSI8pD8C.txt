Do you remember
Remember the night
At a hotel in London
They started to fight
She told her man that
She fell on the ground
She was afraid that
The truth would be found

Do you remember
Do you recall
Do you remember
I remember it all

It's all over now
It's all over now
It's all over now
It's all over now

Do you remember
Remember the place
In a hotel in London
A scar on her face
She told her man that
She fell on the ground
She was afraid that
The truth would be found

Do you remember
Do you recall
Do you remember
'Cause I remember it all

It's all over now
It's all over now
It's all over now
It's all over now

It's all over now
It's all over now
It's all over now
It's all over now
