Some people keep wondering
Some people run without knowing
Some people never found the answer
The answer

Come and step into the light
Let the beat into your heart out

I am falling now into this dream
Let the music guiding me
'Cause now I feel everything for the first time

It's such a beautiful, beautiful life
When every day is made of you and I
Oh oh
Just close your eyes
And we could dance tonight forever

Dance tonight forever

Some people keep wondering
Some people long without knowing
Some people never found the answer
The answer

I'm falling now into this dream
Let the music guiding me
'Cause now I feel everything for the first time

And we could dance tonight forever
