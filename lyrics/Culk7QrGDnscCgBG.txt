If I diden't know better
I say I love you
But I always known better
So I Lock my heart
Baby don't come closer
You know were doomed
But we never be over
If we don't start

Don't start breaking my heart
Don't don't come closer
You want me now
But tell me what happends, When You don't
Oh I can't stand the thought of us beeing over
Cause tell me how will I ever get over you, I wount!

Heart breakfree...
Lets be friends be friends forever
You and me
Lets be friends be friends forever

If I diden't know better
I let you touch me
But you can't shut me out
if I don't let you in
Baby don't come closer
Why can't you see
We will never be over
If we don't begin...

Don't start breaking my heart
Don't dont come closer
You want me now
but baby what happends when you don't
Oh I can't stand the thought of us beeing over
Cause tell me how
