Lost to these linens
My tasteless affections
Are buried in the past
Feelings so fleeting
Yet never completing
The thoughts I quelled to last

It saw too
I saw to it, Anna
I saw too
I saw to it, Anna

I caught a line, I caught a line
Clinging to my own devices

Craving sleep when the evening comes
Strip me down to a heart and lungs
I always sang about ya
Terrified of how waking life walks
Frightened frame with a shirt that talks
I tripped over the moon about ya
Steadfast in nature
The scenes on my pages
Were all mirages now
Everything's vexing
I'm more unconvincing
Than both my parents now

Oh, oh, oh, I waited up for you
Oh, oh, oh, you said that you wanted me too
Oh, oh, oh, I waited up for you
Oh, oh, oh, 21 years for you
21 years for you

I woke with a headache
My bones and my body
Screamed: Son, where the hell is your head?
I reached for some water
To quench the fire
That's burning up in my bed
Haze like a fever
I fell like a dreamer
For sweet tea and lemonade
It clings to my T-shirt
It's loud and it lingers
Designed to suffocate

I light up to find
What I've known all this time
There's some beauty here yet
The folks in town
Have the kindest eyes
But you'll drown in the ways you set
I'll flee like that fever
Lost to that dreamer
All pale-faced for leaving be
Our time is a-coming
But my heart is humming
For a girl that I can't see

(Lost to these feelings)
(On the horizon)
(The future's uncertain)
(My heart is hurting)
(For a girl that I can't see)
(For a girl that I can't see)
(For a girl that I can't see)
(For a girl that I can't see)
(For a girl that I can't see)
(For a girl that I can't see)
