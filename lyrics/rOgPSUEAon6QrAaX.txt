From the falling of the night
To the coming of the day
We are in it for the fight
To wish the pain away
And you know it's always right
But you know you're gonna pay
So you get a sharper knife
And commence to cut away

Revolution underway
Revolution underway
Still a heavy price to pay

In the crosshairs of your sight
You can see the world decay
And you try with all your might
But we're all just jars of clay
Moving at the speed of light
And there's nothing in the way
You know it's gonna change your life
And the change is here to stay

Revolution underway
Revolution underway
Revolution underway
Still a heavy price to pay

Revolution underway
Revolution underway
Revolution underway
Still a heavy price to pay
