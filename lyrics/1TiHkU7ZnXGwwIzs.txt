You held my hand and walked me home, I know
Why you gave me that kiss you were something like this
It made me go, oh, oh

You wiped my tears got rid of all my fears
Why did you have to go?
Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love
Guys are so hard to trust

Did I not tell you that I'm not like that
Girl, the one who gives it all away, yeah?

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you this time?
Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way

Don't think that your charm
And the fact that your arm is now around my neck
Will get you in my pants, I'll have to kick your ass
And make you never forget

I'm gonna ask you to stop thought I liked you a lot
But I'm really upset (really upset)
Get outta my head, get off of my bed
Yeah, that's what I said

Did I not tell you that I'm not like that
Girl, the one who throws it all away?

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you this time?
Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way

This guilt trip that you put me on won't mess me up
I've done no wrong
Any thoughts of you and me have gone away

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you this time?
Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way, yeah (better off that way)

I'm better off alone anyway
