I'll give you countless amounts of outright
Acceptance if you want it
I will give you encouragement to choose
The path you want if you need it

You can speak of anger and doubts
Your fears and freak outs and I'll hold it
You can share your so called shame filled accounts
Of times in your life and I won't judge it
(And there are no strings attached to it)

You owe me nothing for giving the love that I give
You owe me nothing for caring the way that I have
I give you thanks for receiving, it's my privilege
And you owe me nothing in return

You can ask for space for yourself
And only yourself and I'll grant it
You can ask for freedom as well
Or time to travel and you'll have it

You can ask to live by yourself
Or love someone else and I'll support it
You can ask for anything you want
Anything at all and I'll understand it.
(And there are no strings attached to it)

You owe me nothing for giving the love that I give
You owe me nothing for caring the way that I have
I give you thanks for receiving, it's my privilege
And you owe me nothing in return

I bet you're wondering when
The next payback shoe will eventually drop
I bet you're wondering when my conditional police
Will force you to cough up

I bet you're wondering how far
You have now danced your way back into debt
This is the only kind of love, as I understand it
That there really is

You can express your deepest of truths
Even if it means I'll lose you and I'll hear it
You can fall into the abyss
On your way to your bliss, I'll empathize with

You can say that you'll have to skip town
To chase your passion and I'll hear it
You can even hit rock bottom
Have a mid-life crisis and I'll hold it
(And there are no strings attached to it)

You owe me nothing for giving the love that I give
You owe me nothing for caring the way that I have
I give you thanks for receiving, it's my privilege
And you owe me nothing in return

You owe me nothing for giving the love that I give
You owe me nothing for caring the way that I have
I give you thanks for receiving, it's my privilege
And you owe me nothing in return
