I got crows out my window
Dogs at my door
I don't think I can take anymore
What am I doing wrong?
I don't know

My brother told me
Life's not a pain
That was right when it started to rain
Where am I going wrong?
I don't know

But it's alright
Sleep tight
I will take the strain
You're fine
Love of mine
You will feel no pain

Well, I see trouble at every turn
I've got so many lessons to learn
What am I doing wrong?
I don't know

Now what's the matter with me?
Am I right?
Am I wrong?
Now I've started to see
I must try to be strong

I've tried to love you best as I can
But you know that I'm only a man
Why am I going wrong?
I don't know

Ooh, yeah
Oh, woah, woah, woah, mhmm
But it's alright
Sleep tight
I will take the strain
Yeah, you're fine
Little love of mine
You will feel no pain

I got crows at my window
And dogs at my door
But I don't think I can take anymore
What am I doin' wrong?
I don't know

Now what's the matter with me?
I don't know, I don't know
What's the matter with me?
I don't know, I don't know
What's the matter with me?
I don't know, I don't know
