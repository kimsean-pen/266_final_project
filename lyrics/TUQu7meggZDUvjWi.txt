You said I didn't do anything wrong
But there musta been something I coulda done better
Oh, oh
You said I didn't do anything wrong
But there musta been something I coulda done better

Did you want me at home more?
Was I running around
More than you liked me leaving you?
Did you want more alone time?
Was I calling you up
Every night when I needed you?
Times that I was tired and selfish
Don't know why I did it, I couldn't help it
But you know that I tried
Now I keep on asking could I, could I?

You said I didn't do anything wrong
But there musta been something I could've done better
Oh,
You said I didn't do anything wrong
But there musta been something I could've done better

Memories twist the light
And I know you're thinking tonight
About the things I did right

But seeing you so happy now
Has got me thinking about all the things I did wrong
Times that I was quiet and distant
Don't know why
I didn't tell you what I meant but you know that I tried
Now I keep asking could I, could I?

You said I didn't do anything wrong
But there musta been something I coulda done better
Oh, oh
You said I didn't do anything wrong
But there musta been something I could've done better
Oooh,
I, I didn't do anything wrong
But there musta been something I coulda done better
Oh, oh
You said I didn't do anything wrong
But there musta been something I could've done better
