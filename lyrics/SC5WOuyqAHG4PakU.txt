Making all these waves and
I wonder where the days went
I sit and think of you, I hope the feeling's mutual
I'm seeing all you gave and
It somehow don't seem even close to what I'd do
To break in two seems natural

These days are great
There's work to do
Would you like to work with me, I'd love to work you
These days are great
And so are you
I think it's something positive, and negative too

Playing all these games and
I wonder who's to blame it
I sit and think it's you, I'm sure the feelings mutual
We're growing cold
Its getting old
We should have known it's over

These days are great
There's work to do
Would you like to work with me, I'd love to work you
These days are great
And so are you
I think it's something positive, and negative too

We'll be a real team
We'll be a real team

These days are great
There's work to do
Would you like to work with me, I'd love to work you
These days are great
And so are you
I think it's something positive, and negative too

These days are great
There's work to do
Would you like to work with me, I'd love to work you
These days are great
And so are you
I told you
