(The following tone is a reference tone
Recorded at our operating level)
From around the corner a wind blew back, follow the yellow brick road
It ended up in black on black
I was taught the gift of love
Smiling children painted joy sunshine bright girl and boy
bag of tricks and candy sticks peppermint kite for my toy

Yellow brick black on black
Keep on walking and don't look back
I walked along happy and them came back
I follow the yellow brick road
Lost and found I saw you down on the bound off the bound
Taught against the love yellow brick road took my load
Sunshine girl sunshine girl come to my abode 1-2-3-4-5 miles long
Oh I can't ever (so) go wrong

Clouds were gray yesterday devil on my shoulder there's time to play

Yellow brick black on black
Keep on walking and don't look back
From around the corner a wind blew back, follow the yellow brick road
It ended up in black on black
I was taught the gift of love
Smiling children painted joy sunshine bright girl and boy
bag of tricks and candy sticks peppermint kite for my toy

Yellow brick black on black
Keep on walking and don't look back
I follow the yellow brick road...
