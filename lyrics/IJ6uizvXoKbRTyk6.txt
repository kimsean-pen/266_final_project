I'm here
Just like I said
Though its breaking every rule I've ever made
My racin' heart
Is just the same
Why make it strong to break it once again?

And I'd love to say I do
Give everything to you
But I can never now be true
So I say

I think I'd better leave right now
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now
Feelin' weaker and weaker
Somebody better show me out
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now

I'm here
So please explain
Why you're openin' up a healin' wound again
I'm a little more careful
Perhaps it shows
But if I lose the highs, at least I'm spared the lows

Now I tremble in your arms
What could be the harm
To feel my spirit calm
So I say

I think I'd better leave right now
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now
I'm feelin' weaker and weaker
Somebody better show me out
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now

I wouldn't know how to say
How good it feels seeing you today
I see you've got your smile back
Now you say your right on track

But you may never know why
Once bitten twice is shy
If I'm proud perhaps I should explain
I couldn't bear to lose you again

I think I'd better leave right now
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now
Feelin' weaker and weaker
Somebody better show me out
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now
Yes I will

I think I'd better leave right now
I'm feelin' weaker and weaker
Somebody better show me out
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now
