Hello my name is no one and I've lost my way
I close my eyes and pray that I can dream again
They sent me out in a world that wasn't fair
Where people hurt the ones they love because they're scared

Oh, We keep sailing on we keep sailing on
With the wind at our back we always keep moving on
And I might be tired but the lights keep guiding me home
Oh, We keep sailing on we keep sailing on

I can't remember what I'm fighting for
It faded like my name I wrote upon the shore
I swear to you I'd return with better days
If you promise me the sun is right behind the haze

Oh, We keep sailing on we keep sailing on
With the wind at our back we always keep moving on
And I might be tired but the lights keep guiding me home
Oh, We keep sailing on we keep sailing on

Life is but a dream
Life is but a dream
Life is but a dream
DREAM WITH ME

Oh, We keep sailing on we keep sailing on
With the wind at our back we always keep moving on
And I might be tired but the lights keep guiding me home
Oh, We keep sailing on we keep sailing on

Oh, We keep sailing on we keep sailing on
Oh, We keep sailing on we keep sailing on
Oh, We keep sailing on we keep sailing on

Hello my name is no one and I've lost my way
I close my eyes and pray that I can dream again
