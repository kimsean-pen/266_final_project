You were mine back in time, new to the world
And I was hot but I was not nothing but a girl
When we met, you knew then that we were gonna grow
Side by side and then apart, you'd have to let me go

But I, had never known that
You decided
You had to let me go

You were mine another time but now you're so far
Away from me, it's hard to see who you were for who you are
I know it ends--there's nothing left so where am I gonna go?
How do I feel behind the wheel; does my fear show?

But I, had never known that
You decided
You had to let me go
