Don't go changing to try and please me
Never let me down before
M-m-m-m-m-m...
Don't imagine you're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore...

I would not leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far
M-m-m-h-m-m
I took the good times
I'll take the bad times
I take you just the way you are...

Don't go trying some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair
M-m-m-m-m-m...
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care
I... don't want clever conversation
Never want to work that hard
M-m-m-h-m-m-m-m-m
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are...
Need to know that you will always be
Same old someone that I knew
Oh, what will it take till you believe in me
The way that I believe in you
I said I love you that's forever
This I promise from the heart
M-m-m-h-m-m...
I couldn't love you any better
I love you just the way you are... right
I... don't want clever conversation
I never want to work that hard
M-m-m-m-m-m
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are...
