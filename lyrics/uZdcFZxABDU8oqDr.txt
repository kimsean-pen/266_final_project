Invade and encompass to judge and dissect
Witness and persecute to serve and protect
To serve and protect, to serve
To serve and protect, to serve

Watchful and aware
Constrain every movement
Admit the consequences
Freedom's an illusion

Where is security governed through scrutiny?
Your privacy denied, organized and confined
No place to hide, no place to hide
Hide, hide, hide

There is no place to hide
Plugged in your mind
Conformed design

There is no place to hide
Plugged in your mind
Conformed design

To concede your rights
Concedes your mind
Surrender to authority

To concede your rights
Concedes your mind
Surrender to authority

All must abide and all must adhere
Future oppression becoming more clear
This is a warning so you must take heed
This coming vision is reality

Where is security governed through scrutiny?
Your privacy denied, organized and confined
No place to hide, no place to hide
No place to hide, no place to hide
Hide, hide, hide
