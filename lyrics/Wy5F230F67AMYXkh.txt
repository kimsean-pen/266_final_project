In a car outside, we stalk the idle kind
If you're leaving, just let me know
Tobacco and peppermint, dusting for fingerprints
A film in her eyes from the glow
Some rules are made with all intentions to break
And she defends it with a warped rationale
But I've seen what happens to the wicked and proud
When they decide to try to take on the throne for the crown

And we learn as we age
We've learned nothing and my body still aches
And you take 'cause they give
Though I love you and my body it leaks like a sieve

When it got cold outside, smoke beneath the playground lights
If you're coming home, just let me know
Sucking on your breath mint, dissected and stuck with pins
A film in her eyes from the glow
Concrete and water, she's looking for her daughter
At midnight in torrential downpour
And everything I said about how messed up your head is
Got cut up and left in bits and pieces on the ground

And we learn as we age
We've learned nothing and my body still aches
And you take cause they give
Though I love you and my body it leaks like a sieve

And we learn as we age
We've learned nothing and my body still aches
And you take cause they give
Though I love you and my body it leaks like a sieve

Take the picture from the wall
'Cause you think that nothing matters
Take a picture from the plane
And it's a long way to the floor
Cut your finger on the edge
'Cause it's sharper than they told you
Take a leap from out the window
'Cause it's way too far to go through the door

And we learn as we age
We've learned nothing and my body still aches
And you take cause they give
Though I love you and my body it leaks like a sieve
