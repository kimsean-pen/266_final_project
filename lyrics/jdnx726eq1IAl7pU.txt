Everything must come to an end
Don't rely on the trust of men
Remember how it used to be?
People helping those in need

And good guys always finish last
Power corrupts and good turns bad
Remember how I used to be?
Always helping those in need

The rise and fall
I never thought it through at all
Held onto the power too long
Forsaken all the friends I know

All of this is just a game
I don't give a damn or change
Deep, deep down, we're all the same
Money, power, glory, fame

And reaching out to hear the truth
No matter what it does to you
Secrets hid in every drawer
But no one knows what we're hiding for

The rise and fall
I never thought it through at all
Held onto the power too long
Forsaken all the friends I know

Together we rise and united we fall
Together we rise and united we fall
Together we rise and united we fall
Together we rise and united we fall

And together we rise and united we fall
Together we rise and united we fall
Together we rise and united we fall
Together we rise and united we fall

The rise and fall
I never thought it through at all
Held onto the power too long
Forsaken all the friends I know

Together we rise and united we fall
Together we rise and united we fall
Together we rise and united we fall
Together we rise and united we fall

And together we rise and united we fall
Together we rise and united we fall
Together we rise and united we fall
Together we rise and united we fall
