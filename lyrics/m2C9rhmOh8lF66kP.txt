I been me, I been followin' my dreams
Tryin' to find the scene where you believed me
I been true, I been waiting here for you
I been patient, understanding and believing

Every time you turn around
I know you're standing there waiting for me
To take it on back down the other road baby
But I won't let you down

I know you're standing there waiting for me
To take it on back down the other road baby
But I won't let you down every time you turn around

I been good, I been doin' what I should
Workin' hard to make a world that we can live in
I been strong, I been holdin' out so long
And I don't want you to forget you are forgiven

I know you're standing there waiting for me
To take it on back down the other road baby
But I won't let you down

I know you're standing there waiting for me
To take it on back down the other road baby
But I won't let you down every time you turn around

All the reasons you believe what you believe
Never seeing that the truth is a part of me
Now I'm gonna do is show you what it really means to love
What it really means to love

I know you're standing there waiting for me
To take it on back down the other road baby
But I won't let you down

I see you standing there waiting for me
To take it on back down the other road baby
But I won't let you down every time you turn around
Every time you turn around, every time you turn around
Every time you turn around
