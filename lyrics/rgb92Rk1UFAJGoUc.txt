TIME

Happiness that we have is so elusive
Like the shadows disappearing in the noontime
Emptiness that we have is so depressive that we lose control
Happiness that we had was so ... so elusive

Hold pause
Hold pause

I'm sorry I could not freeze time
I'm sorry I could not freeze time now

Looking through your photos I've lived your life
(like I watched the movie of your life)
They're like spirits showing all at once in the night time
All the time that we have is limited so all we do is run
And we lose control
Happiness that we had was so ... so elusive
