I am no better at this than you are
Unfinished business maybe, do love
I can't change myself into you dear
What you are to me is far too unclear

Quit being a nail in my coffin and I don't need another one
Quit being a nail in my coffin and lord knows I ain't ready yet
Quit being a nail in my coffin and I don't need another one
Quit being a line I'm crossing and I am never gonna get back from

I am no better at this than you are
Loneliness never truly leaves me alone
I have made mistakes I can't take back home
I love you just not the way you want

Quit being a nail in my coffin and I don't need another one
Quit being a nail in my coffin and lord knows I ain't ready yet
Quit being a nail in my coffin and I don't need another one
Quit being a line I'm crossing and I am never gonna get back from

Quit being a nail in my coffin and I don't need another one
Quit being a nail in my coffin and lord knows I ain't ready yet
Quit being a nail in my coffin and I don't need another one
Quit being a line I'm crossing and I am never gonna get back from

Quit being a nail in my coffin and I don't need another one
Quit being a nail in my coffin and lord knows I ain't ready yet
Quit being a nail in my coffin and I don't need another one
Quit being a line I'm crossing and I am never gonna get back from
