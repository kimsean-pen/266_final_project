I am, I have

I breathe in and out
I own a heart
An ear and an eye
I've only been here one time
It's passing me by

Been in and out
And in front of my judgmental eyes
My precious disguise
Business so cold
Can't cope with my own
How to not fail

I am flesh, bones
I am skin, soul
I am human
Nothing more than human
I am sweat, flaws
I am veins, scars
I am human
Nothing more than human

I am human
I am human
Human
Human
Human
Human
