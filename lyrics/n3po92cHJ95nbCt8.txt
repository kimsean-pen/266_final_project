(Verse one)
We were talking together
I said "What's up with this weather?"
Don't know whether or not
How sad I just got
Was on my own volition
Or if I'm just missin' the sun

And tomorrow, I know,
Will be rainy at best
And the forecast, I know,
Is that I'll be depressed
But I'll wait outside
Hopin' that I'll catch sight of the sun.

Because on and off,
The clouds have fought
Their control over the sky
And lately the weather
Has been so bi-polar
And consequently so have I

(Chorus)
And now I'm sunny with a high of 75
Since You took my heavy heart
And made it light
And it's funny how you find
You enjoy your life
When you're happy to be alive

(Verse two)
And the temperature is freezing
And then, after dark,
There's a cold frost sweeping
In over my heart
And we might break up
If I don't wake up to the sun

Because on and off,
The clouds have fought
For control over the sky
And lately the weather
Has been so bi-polar
And consequently so have I

(Chorus)
And now I'm sunny with a High
of 75
Since You took my heavy heart
And made it light
And it's funny how you find
You enjoy your life
When you're happy to be alive

Sunny with a High of 75
Since You took my heavy heart
And made it light (made it light)
And its funny how you find
You enjoy your life
When you're happy to be...
Alive
