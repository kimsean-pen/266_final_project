Can you tell me how this ends!
I've never been so close to anyone, that's you
It feels like I'm dreaming, don't wake me up!

Today is for believing
And I am on my last breath
(My last breath)
The end seems so stale
I voiced my love to inhale
I'll be alright
As long as your here by my side!

Sail short
When knowing so much more
You're so much more than I deserve!

You always had to lend a hand
That's why I'll be right here next to you until the end
Never giving up
You're always there, to lift me up!
When times stand tough!
When times stand tough!
Hopes and dreams they are shared by you and me
This is where I want to be, you are my family

Sail short
When knowing so much more
You're so much more than I deserve!

You and I we built this together
Through every practice, this is our surrender, right?
Through all the blood, the sweat, the tears
Everything's been worth it!
And I will protect us
Until my last dying breath

OH!

DON'T LEAVE ME HERE ALONE!
CAUSE I NEED YOU!
DON'T LEAVE ME HERE ALONE!
FOR NOTHING!
DON'T LEAVE ME HERE ALONE!
CAUSE I NEED YOU!
DON'T LEAVE ME HERE ALONE!
DON'T LEAVE ME HERE ALONE

I won't leave you, here alone!
We stand by each other
I won't leave you, here alone!
We stand by each other
