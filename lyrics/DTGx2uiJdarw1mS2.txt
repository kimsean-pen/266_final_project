One, two, three, four

Crazy mama, where you been so long?
Crazy mama, where you been so long?

You've been hidin' out
I know that's true
Crazy mama, I sure need you
Crazy mama, where you been so long?

Standin' on the corner
Lookin' for you, babe
Standin' on the corner
Lookin' for you, babe

Lord, have mercy
I can not see
Crazy mama comin' back to me
Crazy mama, where you been so long?
