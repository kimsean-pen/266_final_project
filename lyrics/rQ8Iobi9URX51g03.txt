just come here i guess
blanket wrapped around my neck
cash filled shoes hold me down
i would rather be in the ground
fine lets go im tired of trying to show you
(corduroy)
im psycho about you not trying to show you
fresh carpet tell secrets but not that i want you
saw science in your garden in your house you love it (i love you)
