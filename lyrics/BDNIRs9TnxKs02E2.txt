I killed you in me
I'm willing to die to seek cover
It leads me to my destiny
How I can never know what happened to me
Outcome none, outcome never makes any sense
Blinded through my eyes, all I see is red death paint
For fear in my head
White bright light
Fearless minds
Falling through again
I'm invincible
I see white lights and empty souls
Drags me down the well
Empty

I'm on my deathbed
Deathbed
I'm on my deathbed
Deathbed
Deathbed

I killed you in me
I'm willing to live to start over
No sign of love, it's obsolete
I still feel lust in power
I'm still on the run
I'm still running away from you
And in this shadow I wait for you
Strip for you
In white light, my fearless mind
Falling through again
I'm invincible
I'm invincible
In white light I see my soul, drowning in a well
Lonely

I'm on my deathbed
Deathbed
I'm on my deathbed
Deathbed
Deathbed
I'm on my deathbed
Deathbed
I'm on my deathbed
Deathbed
Deathbed

I killed
I killed you in me
I killed you
I killed you in me
I killed you
I killed you
I killed you
You in me
I killed you in me

I'm on my deathbed
Deathbed
I'm on my deathbed
Deathbed
Deathbed
I'm on my deathbed
Deathbed
I'm on my deathbed
Deathbed
Deathbed
