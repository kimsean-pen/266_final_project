Here we go
here we go and here we go
all aboard
and we're hittin' the road
here we go rockin' all over the world!

Giddy-up and
giddy-up and get away
we're goin' crazy and we're goin' today
here we go rockin' all over the world!

And I like it
I like it
I like it
I like it
I la-la like it
la-la-li
here we go rockin' all over the world!

We're gonna tell your mama what you're gonna do
just come on out with your rockin' shoes
here we go rockin' all over the world!

And I like it
I like it
I like it
I like it
I la-la like it
la-la-li
here we go rockin' all over the world!

And I like it
I like it
I like it
I like it
I la-la like it
la-la-li
here we go rockin' all over the world!

And I like it
I like it
I like it
I like it
I la-la like it
la-la-li
here we go rockin' all over the world!

And I like it
I like it
I like it
I like it
I la-la like it
la-la-li
here we go rockin' all over the world!
