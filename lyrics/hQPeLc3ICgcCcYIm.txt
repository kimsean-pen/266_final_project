The luxury of having passion
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it

This shit gettin' colossal
This shit gettin' colossal
This shit gettin' colossal
This shit gettin' colossal
We trap out the traphouse
We love it, we gettin' that money
We trap out the traphouse
Just know that we love it, we gettin' that money
This shit gettin' colossal

Hunnas on hunnas, do numbers on numbers
Get llamas on llamas
Got bales by the bundle
Got hunters as gone as [?]
That's a hundred on hundred
Trapped out the house with my partners
We went to shoppin' on midget
We went to [?], take flights out the city
We go to AZ and send it
We go to AZ and get it
I'm hungry, admit it, I swear I'm conditioned
I served and I hustled on any conditions
Fuck your permission, I'll get you them digits
Come to your town and I get it [?]
I get them stacks and get busy
I get that gat and get busy
I take that crack and I flip it
I be in black like a villain
Hop out the 'Lac on some pimpin'
Step to that bitch like I'm golden
Half of these niggas, they bogus
Most of these niggas, they bogus
I go coast to coast, I'm fully loaded
I hit the lights for roaches just to scatter
I had to go to work with heavy metal
I done seen dead bodies in the ghetto
I seen these bitches dancin' with the devil
I seen that money make a bitch evil

This shit gettin' colossal
This shit gettin' colossal
This shit gettin' colossal
We trap out the traphouse
We love it, we gettin' that money
We trap out the traphouse
Just know that we love it, we gettin' that money
This shit gettin' colossal

I fell in love with a kickstand
I stole that bitch with my left hand
I'm 'bout to open a meth lab
I set the blow on the jetway
Called up some places for some big faces
I be in B-More like I'm a Raven
We trap out this bitch 'til the police raid it
I seen that coco turn bad when it get in the pot
I'm sorta like a chef when I'm over the pot
I'm sorta like a ref when we talk 'bout these streets
Whistle official, my pocket gorilla
We trap out these buildings and make us some millions
[?] nigga, the best of my game
We took all this game and went bought us some chains
We Fucking these bitches, ain't none of 'em gettin' claimed
I'm straight up, deranged
I jump out the Range
I go to the flame on a Wednesday
That molly, that drank and that kush
I think I went over my limit
Stack after stack after stack
I'm throwin' this shit to the ceiling
Got three Audemars and a Bentley
And it's one hell of a feeling

This shit gettin' colossal
This shit gettin' colossal
This shit gettin' colossal
We trap out the traphouse
We love it, we gettin' that money
We trap out the traphouse
Just know that we love it, we gettin' that money
This shit gettin' colossal
