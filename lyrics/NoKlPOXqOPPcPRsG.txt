If it's coming, then we'll take it as it comes
And if it's going, then we'll wave it goodbye
Waiting for a train that never comes
You're waiting for a brain that never knows
We break it down, into it's parts
We toured around, and break our hearts
We laughed along, with all of their jokes (Ha ha)
We raced along, and stayed so close
But though it all, yeah
We stay together
We stay together
I know that
My love got no other love
My love got no other love
She got...
She got, a lot
My love got no other love
My love got no other love
She got
A home
And there's a light on that will never go out
And when the night's gone, not a shadow of a doubt
About you
About you
And there's a time bomb that's gonna go off
Then we'll disarm it 'cause I'm so better off with you
Here with you, yeah
We break it down, into its parts
We risk it all through prison bars
We laid it down, there to rest
And hold it down, until it's drowned
But more than that
We stay together
(We, we stay together)
We stay together
(We stay, we stay)
I know that
My love got no other love
My love got no other love
She got...
She got, a lot
My love got no other love
My love got no other love
She got
A home
And there's a light on that will never go out
And when the night's gone, not a shadow of a doubt
About you
About you
And there's a time bomb that's gonna go off
Then we'll disarm it 'cause I'm so better off with you
Here with you
And there's a light on that will never go out
And when the night's gone, not a shadow of a doubt
About you
About you
And there's a time bomb that's gonna go off
Then we'll disarm it 'cause I'm so better off with you
Here with you, yeah
(We, we stay together) We stay together
(We, we stay together) We stay together
(We stay, we stay, we stay)
(We stay, we stay, we stay together) We stay together
(We stay, we stay)
We stay together (We stay, we stay)
