A poor man with four daughters
A wife and a son
Daughter commits adultery
Or so he was told
Bought a knife and machete after Friday's prayers
Fear the young would follow old
Thought all must be killed

For your honor
You will slaughter
Every one of your daughters
For your honor
You will slaughter
It's you who should be slaughtered

Terror grips the steel with hunger
Thirsting to avenge its soiled pride
A shamed mad man
You take their lives away as they sleep
The blade kisses at their throats
Life bleeds without a chance to weep
You take, you take their lives away

Yet a man unrepentant
Don't you realize
You murdered your own children
Call that honorable cause

For your honor
You will slaughter
Every one of your daughters
For your honor
You will slaughter
It's you who should be slaughtered

Terror grips the steel with hunger
Thirsting to avenge its soiled pride
A shamed mad man
You take their lives away as they sleep
The blade kisses at their throats
Life bleeds without a chance to weep
You take, you take their lives away

For your honor
You will slaughter
Every one of your daughters
For your honor
You will slaughter
It's you who should be slaughtered

Terror grips the steel with hunger
Thirsting to avenge its soiled pride
A shamed mad man
You take their lives away as they sleep
The blade kisses at their throats
Life bleeds without a chance to weep
You take, you take their lives away
