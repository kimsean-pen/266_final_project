Must one person's triumph be another's humiliation?
Of course!

Aye, another day waiting for death
Every day that I waste is my list of regrets
So I tell myself, "It's okay, day after next
We'll make all these arrangements to change
You can better yourself"
I know I'm wasting my breath as I inhale
I know I'm escaping my death as I inhale, I
can't recall why I'm suffocating

My lungs are failing

Step into the mind of a cut-throat
Empty streets, cold weather, all alone
Blackness, grey air, just snow
Feelings low, being followed by crows
Call list overflowed with hot lines
Drug help, mental, suicide
Feel tired, feel dried and you wanna die
Pride fried, closed eyes and you start to cry
Swear I spent a lifetime trying to get it right
Still isolated, still out of sight
Keep my dreads swinging like they in a fight
I just wanna kill everyone in sight
Take the money, take the bitches, take the drugs, take the gold
Baby, let me decompose
Never names said more shade spit
I'ma see you one day, that's a promise
