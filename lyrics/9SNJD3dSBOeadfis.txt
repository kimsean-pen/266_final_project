Should I even listen?
Should I even try?
Will I just be hearing
the same old lines, baby?
See it doesn't matter
what you say this time
'Cause our whole relationship
is built on one lie

You say things aren't the way they seem
But still you can't come straight with me
How can you think that you're in love
When you don't know the meaning of?

Love shoulda brought you,
brought you home last night
You shoulda been with me,
shoulda been right by my side
Baby, if you cared anything for me
Then love woulda brought you to me last night

I gotta hand it to ya,
ya had me there for a while
I was so in love with you,
I couldn't see past your smile
Now I smell the coffee, boy,
got a wake up call
And it left the message
that you just don't care at all

You can't expect me
To believe that she does not mean anything
You say that you love only me
Your kinda lovin,' my darling,
I just don't need

Love shoulda brought you,
brought you home last night
You shoulda been with me,
shoulda been right by my side
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby
if you really cared anything for me
Then love woulda brought you to me last night

Love shoulda brought you,
brought you home last night
You shoulda been with me,
shoulda been right by my side
Oh, baby if you cared anything for me,
then you woulda been sincere,
And I wouldn't be in tears,
and love woulda brought you to me last night

Oh baby why, why do men think
that love's just for the moment
Not over time?
Please tell me why
Why should I think that you're gonna be sincere?
Are you deservin'?
Don't blame me if I just don't believe,
just don't believe
That you'll always be here

Love shoulda brought you,
brought you home last night
You shoulda been with me,
shoulda been right by my side
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby
Even if you cared anything for me
Then love woulda brought you to me last night

Love shoulda brought you,
brought you home last night
I know, you shoulda been with me,
shoulda been right by my side
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby
If you really cared anything for me
Then love woulda brought you to me last night
