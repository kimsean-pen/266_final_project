Are you receiving me
Cause I've been sending out a message
Oh baby you and me
Were going out of town tonight

Cause i've been looking for something
Something to shake me
And every place i've been think that i'm still
Waiting for a sign
Oh to take me away
Waiting for a sign
Oh to take me away

Are you believing me
Cause you've been staring at me blankly
I'm getting closer girl
And maybe someday soon you'll see

Cause i've been looking for something
Something to shake me
And every place i've been think that i'm still

Waiting for a sign
Oh to take me away
Waiting for a sign
Oh to take me away

Waiting for a sign
Waiting for a sign

Oh to take me away
Waiting for a
Oh to take me away
Waiting for a sign
Oh to take me away
Waiting for a sign
Oh to take me away

Well if you love me
If you love me give me a sign
Well if you love me
If you love me give me a sign
