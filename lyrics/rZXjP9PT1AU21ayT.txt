We hold by skinny hands
Trying to warm what age has chilled
Weary wintry lands
Where breaths collapse, arise and thrill.

Our sighs fly high above
The sea leaves salty licks and pale lips for the weak
We no longer let us love

Be the end of heartache...
Be the end of heartache...
Be the ember, anew us
This dark water drags us together

Hope cracks with every breath
We've bathed our eyes on darkest shores
Crude waves with lengths of death
Washes over us once more

Our sighs fly high above
The sea leaves salty licks and pale lips for the weak
We no longer let us love.

So linger
Let the worst of us collide
