Waited up, waited up, waited up all night
The sky filling up your mind
Like smoke in some obscure design
Here's another thing

You never said, never said, never said anything new
Not a word that fall
But sometimes nothing says it all
It's one of those things

How could you ever ask for more?
What are you looking for?

You said you wanted to getaway
Now you're leaving your cares behind
Tomorrow turned into yesterday
Why'd you take your time?

Opened your, opened your, opened your eyes
And the ocean slipped through the floor
When you woke up along the shore
Forget everything

You never knew, never knew, never knew that
The city could create such calm
Holding you upon it's palm
Just a little thing

How could you ever ask for more?
What are you looking for?

You said you wanted to get away
Now you're leaving your cares behind
Tomorrow turned into yesterday
Why'd you take your time?

How could you ever ask for more?
What are you looking for?

You said you wanted to get away
Now you're leaving your cares behind
Tomorrow turned into yesterday
Why'd you take your time?
Why'd you take your time?

Just a little thing
