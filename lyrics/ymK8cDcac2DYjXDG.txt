I know I messed it up with every other guy
I swear you're different and this time I'm gonna try
We can start fresher feuds, just let go of the past, yeah
I don't, I don't, I don't get it
Cause I don't judge you like that, yeah

Can't just love me in pieces, gotta love it all, yeah
You tried to make me feel like being human's wrong
You got a lot to say, about me and my past well
I don't, I don't, I don't get it
Cause I don't judge you like that, yeah

Got me running other places in my mind, in my mind
How could you even say I never tried, never tried
And you acting like I been around with every single guy
Got me running other places in my mind, in my mind, yeah
Da dam dam dam dam dam dam, yeah
Da dam dam dam dam dam dam
And you acting like I been around with every single guy
You got me running other places in my mind, in my mind, yeah

I know that I could be with any other man
But none of them can do it quite the way you can
Thought we were strong, oh, why you doubting all the time?
When I don't, I don't, I don't get it
Cause I'm so sleep all the time

Our love is effortless, stop acting like you scared
I get down on my knees but you're not playing fair
My heart breaks down when you questioning your mind
When I don't, I don't, I don't get it
Cause I'm so sleep all the time

Got me running other places in my mind, in my mind
How could you even say I never tried, never tried
And you acting like I been around with every single guy
Got me running other places in my mind, in my mind, yeah
Da dam dam dam dam dam dam, yeah
Da dam dam dam dam dam dam
And you acting like I been around with every single guy
You got me running other places in my mind, in my mind, yeah

And I'm running to these places where nobody else is gone
And I tried to take you with me, baby, when you were around
And I said "I'm here to stay but I need to get away"
So I'm running other places in my mind, in my mind, yeah

Da dam dam dam dam dam dam, yeah
Da dam dam dam dam dam dam (Ooh yeah)
And you acting like I been around with every single guy
You got me running other places in my mind, in my mind, yeah
Da dam dam dam dam dam dam, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Da dam dam dam dam dam dam
And you acting like I been around with every single guy
You got me running other places in my mind, in my mind, yeah
