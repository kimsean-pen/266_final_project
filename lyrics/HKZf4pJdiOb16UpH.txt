La la la la la la la la la

We can't play this game anymore
But can we still be friends?
Things just can't go on like before
But can we still be friends?

We had something to learn
Now it's time for the wheel to turn
Grains of sand, one by one
Before you know it, all gone

Let's admit we made a mistake
But can we still be friends?
(Can we still be friends?)
Heartbreaks never easy to take
But can we still be friends?
(Can we still be friends?)

It's so sad, sad as fair
Sometimes seems like they just don't care
Don't waste time feeling hurt
We've been through hell together

La la la la la la la la la
(Can we still) Can we still get together sometimes?
La la la la la la la la la
(You know) Life will still go on and on and on and on
We awoke from a dream
Things are not always what they seem
Memories linger on
Is like a sweet, sad, old song
