Ri-ridin in the chevy

I been disrespected my whole life
What makes you think I give a fuck what you think?
I pay no mind
I keep thinking about the afterlife
After life is over I'll be casting dice with Satan just to pass the time slower
Closer to the lower polar lasting fire
Suicide ain't sacrifice
It's the asking price in the black void
No flashing lights
I'm fucking satisfied with gnats and flies
Snacking on my calves and thighs
Detach my eyes and hang them by the casket pile

Ri-ridin in the chevy as we also smoke the ink mane

Creepin' up in the cut
Don't give a fuck I bust 'em down and buck 'em
Keeping that weapon tucked
Don't test ya luck I cock it back and bust 'em
Coming up on that 3 6 killa 187 busta mane
Ridin' in the Chevy swerving heavy on these suckas mane
It's the grey large tee
Gold teeth
Never breathing psycho demon looking for a way to scheme in
Brrrrr HA HA HA stick 'em
Robbing is my mission and murder is in my vision
Hoe
