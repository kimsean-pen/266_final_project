You know what I found
I know you fucking 'round
But she was on your mind
The friend that you call Jasmine
I mean, whatever happens, happens
Baby, made me blind, so I kept wasting time
Wanted to rewind, but I'm always seconds after Jasmin
I mean, whatever happens, happens

Now that you got time for it
I hope that you show her love
I'm just fucking mad
'Cause this love was meant for me, you know
But you do it all for Jasmine
You do it all for Jasmine

You do it all for Jasmine
You do it all for Jasmine
You do-do-do it all for Jasmine (Do it all, do it all, do it all)
You do it all for Jasmine (Do it all, do it all, do it all)
You do it all

Say you wanna go, where you wanna go?
Bae, where you wanna go?
I bet you think I can't see that you cheating on me
Last year on new years eve
Give, give, give and take
You good, you great, she goddess, grace
To God, disgrace for fucking Jasmine

Say you gotta go (Say you gotta go)
Sleeping on her pillow
Say you gotta go (Say you gotta go)
Sleeping on her pillow

You do it all for Jasmine
You do it all for Jasmine
You do-do-do it all for Jasmine
You do it all for Jasmine
You do it all for Jasmine
You do it all for Jasmine
You do-do-do it all for Jasmine
You do it all for Jasmine

Jasmine played it right
She took steps that would never make you wanna fight
Where is my mind?
And nights will get blank
So you better both watch your back
I mean, whatever happens, happens

What happens, it just happens
What happens, it just happens
What happens, it just happens
