Until death, used to mean something more
Than a proverb framed on the walls of a broken home

Closed doors can only hide so much
Pacing through this hallway, I listen in disgust
As you divide my mind and force my years into minutes
Destroy the hands of time, the hands that made me whole

What if I become a silhouette of this very same thing?
Then everything you taught me seems to start fading
Oh, how am I now to survive as a heart divided
Between the very hands that made me whole?

Did you even notice, all I wanted was more of your time?
Wasted on hating, when love's what should've made you blind
Did you even notice, all I wanted was more of your time?
Wasted on hating, when love's what should've made you blind

You can only forgive so much
Before you give up because there's no trust
At least you tried and that's just fine
But how the hell do I know I'm not next in line?
It's not my fault, then why am I in the middle of this burning bridge?

Tell me, oh how am I now to survive as a heart divided
Between the very hands that made me whole?
Did you even notice, all I wanted was more of your time?
Wasted on hating, when love's what should've made you blind
Did you even notice, all I wanted was more of your time?
Wasted on hating, when love's what should've made you blind

I am the one who suffers from your bullshit, I'm the one who suffers
My world divided, by the hands that made me whole
