Attention, attention, everyone
I got a couple of things, I would like to get off of my chest
Friends, who the fuck needs them?
You know who you are

Caught like a fly in a web of your lies
It's truth be told now or it's meet your demise
So how did it feel when you held the knife
That you stuck right in my back a thousand times?

Your grandfather would probably roll in his grave
If he knew of that person that you had became
Oh, I will not just lay down and take this
Not again, not again

You have left my heart black and blue
Just like your father did to you

How does it feel, knowing you're barely alive?
Seeing through bloodshot eyes, you're left empty inside
Where I was strung out and drug through the mud
I must agree, you're just like me

And when you die, I won't be at your wake
No eulogy from me, just a smile on my face
And while God might be busy with judging your soul
I will have slept with the girl that you love most

You have left my heart black and blue
Just like your father did to you

How does it feel, knowing you're barely alive?
Seeing through bloodshot eyes, you're left empty inside
Where I was strung out and drug through the mud
I must agree, you're just like me

How does it feel, knowing you're barely alive?
Seeing through bloodshot eyes, you're left empty inside
Where I was strung out and drug through the mud
I must agree, you're just like me

I'm no fucking saint, but at least I will fucking sing about it
Oh, the audacity
