Do I have to freak out?
I have to figure out what this song is about
'Cause maybe "dara dara hey" won't work out

It's a massive blackout
Do I have to freak?
Do I have to freak out?

Why can't I sing a song as good
As Bobby's girl?
Misguided ghost made me think "Hey"

I... will always love you, and I
I... will always love you, and I

Ain't no need to freak out
By writing down what you can't write down is already writing down
"Dara dara hey" one more time

On my way to lie down
Ain't no need to freak
Ain't no need to freak out

Why can't I sing a song as good
As Bobby's girl?
Misguided ghost made me think "Hey"

I... will always love you, and I
I... will always love you, and I

Misguided ghost... Misguided ghost...
Misguided ghost... trying to... "Hey..."
Misguided ghost... Misguided ghost...
Misguided ghost... made me think... "Hey..."

Misguided ghost... Misguided ghost...
Misguided ghost... trying to... "Hey..."
Misguided ghost... Misguided ghost...

I... will always love you, and I
I... will always love...
I... will always love you, and I
