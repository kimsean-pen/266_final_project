Walking at midnight
In the darkness, alone
Standing in the shadows
And I'm watching your glow

Standing in the red light
And I'm smiling at you
Dreaming of the starlight
Just waiting for you

I'll do anything to
Make you mine, make me shine
Take me if you want me
I don't care, I don't mind

I want your starlight
Make it mine, make me shine
Touch me with your light
And I'll burn like a star
