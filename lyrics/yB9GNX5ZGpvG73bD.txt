Back in a time I see why i don't even know
Can't ask me if i do
There will tears in the eyes and the ears and you know that i didn't know
But you
Know it
Don't you?

Sun rises up, by the time
Keep it down, I'll be round tonight
I could tell you my part
But i will have to face it
Out of fate

Back in a time I see why i don't even know
Can't ask me if i do
There will tears in the eyes and the ears and you know that i didn't even know
But you
Know it
Don't you?

Sun rises up, by the time
Keep it down, I'll be round tonight
? try to tell you my part
I could tell you my part
But i will have to face it
Out of fate
I've got these feelings about it so long
Try to build it back up
Are you
And it feels like so long
I'll build it back up I so long
i've had this feeling about it so long
Try to build it back up
Are you
And it feels like so long
I'll build it back up I so long
Sun rises up, by the time
Keep it down, I'll be round tonight
? try to tell you my part
I could tell you my part
But i will have to face it
Out of fate
And it feels like so long
I'll build it back up I so long
