This may be where the sidewalk ends
Far below me are shimmering surfaces
Water, I need water
I've killed everyone here except for my daughter

She had sixteen points to make
Five were heads, the other ten were snakes
Chasing their tails, bringing her father down
What does it say?
What does it say? Whether you're better than them?
Whether it's a matter of sliding out over?
Slave to the limit, goodbye my friends
I'm beginning to bond with what I lost sight of

Safe to crawl across this tin-can-tightrope walk
I want to crawl across
I want to crawl across this footprint dialogue fog
I want to crawl, crawl
I don't think we should all, we should all, we should
Forget a bit about it
Mnemonic man, mnemonic man, do you recall
When you pushed a little further?

We're just here to burn your cities down
Caught a lot of love, heard a lot of empty voices
Got a lot to learn to overcome my motives
And then move beyond those ordinary ways
We have seen the naked, automated cabaret
And we've moved, we've moved on
So move us on...

I've had enough of idle reverie, I for one can only see
What dreams may come for us
I've had enough of flight and gravity
Spill me out evolved and screaming:
I'm not meaningless

Left up to you I'd drown in the desert
Left up to you I'd use up forever
Choking down your plastic water...
