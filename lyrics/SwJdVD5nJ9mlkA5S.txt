I don't need another lover
I don't need another lover, hey
Unless you're takin' my place
I don't need another lover,
and I don't know if I can be
Anyone 'till I like me
Baby, I don't need another other,
From the beginning to the end
I can see who've been my friends
I can see who's tried to bet me
I can see who tries to undermine me
I don't need another bother
From the conception to the close
I can see who I need most
I can see who I've been host to
And I can see who tries to compromise me,
and I don't need another bother!

I don't need another brother,
I don't need another brother, hey
Unless you're sharing my name,
I don't need another brother,
And I don't know if I can take
Anymore keep on them bake
Baby, I don't need another brother
From the beginning to the end
I can see who've been my friends
I can see who's tried to bet me
I can see who tries to undermine me
I don't need another bother
From the conception to the close
I can see who I need most
I can see who I've been host to
And I can see who tries to compromise me,
and I don't need another bother!
