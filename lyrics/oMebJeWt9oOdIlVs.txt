We fall again, we fall again
We fall again
We fall again

Slow down
(Chains)
We fall again, we fall again
We fall again (ooohh)
We fall again

When you turn around, I lose vision
Got me running deep in the superstition, and I
Can't believe my fucking eyes

Yet a thousand years,
I never thought I would see you come from beneath me
I feel like falling
(Drops coin)
I feel like falling

We fall again, we fall again (yeah)
We fall again (ooohh)
We fall again

When you turn around, I lose vision (we)
Got me running deep

Fall again, we fall again
We fall again
We fall again
