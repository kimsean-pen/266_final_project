Feels like we're drawn to find escape
Feels like we're lost but found our way
We are young and free, so let us be
We used to break but now we see
With so much clarity

Can you imagine
Letting our dreams run wild
Can you imagine
Leaving it all behind
This time we'll fade into blinding light
Who cares what we do tonight
Oh, can you imagine
Imagine

Oh, can you imagine
Imagine

Can you imagine
Letting our dreams run wild
Can you imagine
Leaving it all behind
This time we'll fade into blinding light
Who cares what we do tonight
Oh, can you imagine
Imagine

Don't wait until the stars align
Just let our hearts wake our minds
We are young and free, so let us be
We used to break but now we see
With so much clarity

Can you imagine
Letting our dreams run wild
Can you imagine
Leaving it all behind
This time we'll fade into blinding light
Who cares what we do tonight
Oh, can you imagine
Imagine

Can you imagine
Letting our dreams run wild
Can you imagine
Leaving it all behind
This time we'll fade into blinding light
Who cares what we do tonight
Oh, can you imagine
Imagine
