Jealousy don't take my soul away from me
I understand you and you make me sick
Jealousy I'm green with envy
I'm turning into my worst enemy

That's who you are to me
That's who you are to me

Jealousy you're insecurity
You make me feel like I'm hanging from a thread
From the top of this lover's game
I'm swimming in a pool of endless shame

That's what you are to me
That's what you are to me

And then I met the hawk on the corner
The hawk said that everything's cool
And since the hawk is most righteous
To not believe her I'd be a fool

And then I met the wolf on the mountain
The wolf said everything's right
And since the wolf is most righteous
I'll always trust her insight

That's who you are to me
That's who you are to me
That's who you are to me
That's who you are to me
