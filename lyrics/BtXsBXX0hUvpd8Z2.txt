A man came to me he said he'd save me
He put his hands on me he called me family
His voice sang to me he said he gave my name to me
I asked him where he'd been he said he'd been with my friends

My hands all in my skins crawling
I've been rambling from the Midwest to New Orleans and
I've met preachers they say that I'm a thinker
They go deep but my scars go deeper
What goes around comes around they say
But I be prayin that it just ain't true

I got my black rifle my baby and my bible
I ain't slept in a week it's got me higher than the Eiffel
I been drug dealin and woman stealing
I lost feelin back when we was children
And i...
What the hell's really goin on?

A woman came to me she said she'd save me
She laid my body at the base of an ash tree
I asked her business it wasn't in forgiveness
I heard her say that and felt fire where I laid at

And my hands all in my skins crawling
I've ran from law men all around my city and
I've met thinkers they say that I'm a dreamer
They think deep but my scars run deeper
What goes around comes around they say
But I be prayin that it just ain't true

I got my black rifle my baby and my bible
I ain't slept in a week it's got me higher than the Eiffel
I been drug dealin and woman stealing
I lost feelin back when we was children
And I turned on my idols it was all about survival I
I killed my darlings I can't say that I'm sorry
What the hell's really goin on?
What the hell's really goin on?

I got my black rifle my baby and my bible
Black rifle my baby and my bible
I got my black rifle my baby and my bible
Black rifle my baby and my bible
What goes around comes around they say
But I be prayin that it just ain't true

Tell my brothers I hope they know I love em
Watch my sisters, kiss all my cousins
Tell Clinton "my uncle says he missed him"
Tell Regean "my auntie thinks he's Satan"
Have babies we don't know how to raisem
Tell Haiti "we don't know that we're crazy"
Tell my mamma "I'm sorry for the drama" but
Tell your honor "is death before dishonor"

I got my black rifle my baby and my bible
Black rifle my baby and my bible
I got my black rifle my baby and my bible
Black rifle...
