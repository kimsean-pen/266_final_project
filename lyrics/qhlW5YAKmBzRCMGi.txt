My baby's long and tall
Shaped like a cannonball
Say, every time she loves me
Lordy, you can hear me squall

She cried, ooh wee
I believe I'll change my mind
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living"
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine"

My baby knows just how
To treat me right
Gives me plenty loving
Morning, noon and night

She cried, ooh wee
I believe I'll change my mind
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living"
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine"

When my baby does
What she does to me
I climb the highest mountain
Dive in the deepest sea

She cried, ooh wee
I believe I'll change my mind
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living"
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine"

My baby's lips are red
And sweet like wine
And when she kisses me
I get high every time

She cried, ooh wee
I believe I'll change my mind
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living"
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine"
