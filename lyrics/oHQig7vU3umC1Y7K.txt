Here I am beside myself again
I'm torn apart by words that you have said
And all in all, I know we're falling apart
Where did you run to so far away

And here we are to sing you a song
And there you are asleep against the window pane
Just like always

You said you like to hear the rain sometimes
And all I can do is tell you the truth
And oh, my eyes will tell you the same

And here we are to sing you a song
And there you are asleep again
And here we are to sing you a song
And there you are asleep again

Grasp my hands, together we feel we are one result
Grasp my hands, together we feel we are one result
And grasp my hands, together we feel we are one result
Grasp my hands, together we feel we are one result

And here we are to sing you a song
And there you are asleep again
And here we are to sing you a song
And there you are asleep again

Here I am beside myself again
