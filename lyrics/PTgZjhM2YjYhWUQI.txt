This is not a test or an SOS
I'm no longer on a quest to get girls undressed
I search through their hearts and no treasure I've found
I'm so lucky this one lets dogs hang around.

It's good having somebody good for a change
I thought that no good, dirty cheats had drove me insane
I've finally given up on love and romance
If I lay down the sword I'm givin my innocence.

(Coming for your heart like a cannibal)
Oh, she lets me light in and I'm fed till I'm full
(If something goes wrong I'm accountable)
Oh, a life without her is no life at all
I la la la la la la la la love you cannibal queen.

If she ever left me I would break down and die
Like Nicky and Pete you could bury me alive
Another pretty girl I would love to admire
From a distance, but she's here so I'll jump in the fire.

(Coming for your heart like a cannibal)
Oh, she lets me light in and I'm fed till I'm full
(If something goes wrong I'm accountable)
Oh, a life without her is no life at all
I la la la la la la la la love you cannibal queen.
