I've fallen out of favor and I've fallen from grace
Fallen out trees and I've fallen on my face
Fallen out of taxis out of windows too
Fell in your opinion when I fell in love with you
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Sometimes I wish for falling, wish for the release
Wish for falling through the air to give me some relief

Because falling's not the problem, when I'm falling I'm at peace

It's only when I hit the ground that causes all the grief

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

This is a song for a scribbled out name
And my love keeps writing again and again
This is a song for a scribbled out name

And my love keeps writing again and again

And again
And again
And again
And again

And again
And again
And again
And again
And again
And again
And again

And again
And again
And again
And again

I'll dance myself up
Drunk myself down
Find people to love
Left people to drown

I'm not scared to jump

I'm not scared to fall
If there was nowhere to land
I wouldn't be scared
At all
At all
At all
At all
Fall
Fall

Sometimes I wish for falling
Wish for the release
Wish for falling through the air
To give me some relief
Because falling's not the problem
When I'm falling I'm at peace
It's only when I hit the ground
It causes all the grief
