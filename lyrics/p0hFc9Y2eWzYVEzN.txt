Do it again
And I'll see you tomorrow
I want to get it
You've got something to borrow

Can't make it feel right on my own
That's when I turn you on again
I buy it, but it don't measure up
What is the missed ingredient?

I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away
I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away

Under the skin
It's not so easy to swallow
Don't reel me in
To find my dreams are so hollow

What is it you got I don't get?
I watch you fumbling again
Look dreamy behind your cigarette
Know it ain't true now

I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away
I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away

We all find you easy, so amuse us
Don't get too heady you might abuse luck
You're starstruck

I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away
I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away
