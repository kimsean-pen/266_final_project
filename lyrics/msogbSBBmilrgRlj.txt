Every time I get away
You find a way to reel me back in (oh)
Tell me that you love me
Hold me tight so we can always be friends (oh)
I swear
I've said it before and I'll say it again! (oh)

Every time I get away
You find a way to pull me back in (oh)
Why does it take so long?
Why does it feel so wrong?
Why does it take so loong?

Knew I couldn't help myself
I had to lay low
So I couldn't help myself
I lost my halo

Take me by the hand and
Still remember all the good times we had (oh)
I remember how you took my favorite knife
And sticked under my skin (oh)
I swear
I've said it before, and I say it again! (oh)
Every time I get away
You find a way back under my skin
Why does it take so long?
Why does it feel so wrong?

Knew I couldn't help myself
I had to lay low
So I couldn't help myself
I lost my halo

All my life
With a skeleton
I had to let go
So I couldn't help myself
I lost my halo
I lost my halo
I lost my halo
