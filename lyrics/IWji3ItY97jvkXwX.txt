My love is gone, left me with both empty hands
My love will come in the glitter of a spark.
Ohh, you saved my life and went away.
Glass and winter bones have distracted well my sight
as I'm waiting here the world's discovered one more time.
Ohh, you saved my life and went away.
Ohh, come save my life again.
