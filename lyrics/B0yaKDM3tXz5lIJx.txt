Everything's falling apart!

Stutter step through another trap set by deception
Mention rejection, rejection
Always lies in your eyes
Settles in your action, lies in your eyes
Settles in your action

Jeopardize everything that I want
And I won't compromise anything anymore
In any way victimize myself any more
Liberty yeah!

Manipulation's on my mind
Expectations well defined
Frustrate me
Liberate me
Cause everything's falling apart
(You can't control me!)
(You can't control me!)

Everything's falling apart
(You can't control me!)
(You can't control me!)

When everything's falling apart

Now I can't see you
Doesn't matter what I do
Can't see you
Cause everything's falling apart

I got exposed to a deeper form of infection
Shout out "I need acception"
Always lies in your eyes
Settles in your action, lies in your eyes
Settles in your action

Criticize everything that I do
And I will overcome anything that's in store
Nevermore look up to you and adore
Liberty yeah!

Manipulation's on my mind
Expectations well defined
Frustrate me
Liberate me

Cause everything's falling apart
(You can't control me!)
(You can't control me!)

Everything's falling apart
(You can't control me!)
(You can't control me!)

Everything's falling apart
Now I can't see you
Doesn't matter what I do
Can't see you
Cause everything's falling apart

Manipulation's on my mind
(Inspect me)
(Try to check me)

Expectations well defined
(Dissect me)
(Want to wreck me)

Violator of my own will
(Accept me)
(Reject me)

Separate or
Shoot to kill

And everything's falling apart
(You can't control me!)
(You can't control me!)

Everything's falling apart
(You can't control me!)
(You can't control me!)

Everything's falling apart
Now I can't see you
Doesn't matter what I do
Can't see you
Cause everything's falling apart
(You can't control me!)
(You can't control me!)

Everything's falling apart
(You can't control me!)
(You can't control me!)

Everything's falling apart
Now I can't see you
Doesn't matter what I do
Can't see you
Cause everything's falling apart
