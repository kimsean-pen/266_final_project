This mess of emotions got his body questioning
Is this feeling alright?
He studying my freckles like the constellations
And he's looking for signs

I know that you're not used to this
Boy will you let me teach you
Your mind is asking for my love
And you just need to hear it
Try not to wander off too much
Don't let your feels control you
Keep you attentive with authentic kisses
Filled with amor

I'll show you
How it's supposed to feel
When we meet
At Orion's Belt
I'll show you
How it's supposed to feel

Running my fingers through your hair I'm feeling
That your thoughts have left this Earth
Is it worth it? Yes
Is it genuine? Can I love like this?
Let me give you some reasons

I know that you're not used to this
Boy will you let me teach you
Your mind is asking for my love
And you just need to hear it
Try not to wander off too much
Don't let your feels control you
Keep you attentive with authentic kisses
Filled with amor

I'll show you
How it's supposed to feel
When we meet
At Orion's Belt
I'll show you
How it's supposed to feel

When your hands running down my body
It's like a ticket to a cosmic sky
Let your body get used to this
Let your body get used to this
It don't matter where we are
Cause when we're touching we're caressing stars
Let your body get used to this
Let your body get used to this

I'll show you
How we're supposed to feel
When we meet
At Orion's Belt
I'll show you
How we're supposed to feel
