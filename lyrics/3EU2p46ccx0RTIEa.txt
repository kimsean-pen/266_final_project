Yes, don't close the door
Listen, I've been waitin' to tell you this
You are, more than a man could ever want
Wait a minute, just let me there, listen

I stepped in a club in your hood
I slowly turned left and there you stood
You and your friends talkin'
But then our eyes connect and moved in

It was just like 2 ways on beam
I'm your king, be my queen
And what did you wanna do tonight?
My truck is parked out front, so let's ride

I can read your mind, babe
(Ohh)
I know what you're thinkin'
(I know what you're thinkin', baby)
It's alright
(With me, baby)
It's alright, yes
(Ohh yeah)
I can read your mind, babe
(I can)
I know what you're thinkin'
(I know what you're thinkin', baby)
It's alright
(With me, yeah yeah)
It's alright, yes

So baby take a ride with me
And I'll fulfill all your fantasies
And when the rain starts pourin' down
Then all the love that's lost will be found

I'll make your mind loose control
Over your body that's my goal
So baby just come down here
Just let the gravity pull you near

I can read your mind, babe
(I can)
I know what you're thinkin'
(I know what you're thinkin')
It's alright
(Can you feel me? Yeah)
It's alright, yes
(Ooh, baby)

I can read your mind, babe
(Just me and you right now)
I know what you're thinkin'
(I got an idea, babe)
It's alright
(Oh yeah)
It's alright, yes

I know you wanna rub
(Rub)
I know you wanna touch
(Touch)
I know you wanna feel
(Feel)
So, baby keep it real

I know you wanna see
(See)
I know you wanna be
(Be)
In my B E D
Grindin' slowly

I know you wanna rub
(Rub)
I know you wanna touch
(Touch)
I know you wanna feel
(Feel)
So baby keep it real

I know you wanna see
(See)
I know you wanna be
(Be)
In my B E D
Grindin' slowly

I can read your mind, babe
(I can read it)
I know what you're thinkin'
(And I know)
It's alright
(You see, I know, what you know)
It's alright, yeah
(I can feel it too, baby)

I can read your mind, babe
(Just me and you, yeah)
I know what you're thinkin'
(I know, yeah)
It's alright
(Oh, oh yeah)
It's alright, yes

I wanna love baby
(That's what I wanna do to you)
I wanna feel you
(If you come, if you come)
I wanna love baby
(Oh yeah)
I wanna feel you
(I wanna feel you, girl)

I wanna love baby
(Come on and go with me)
(I want you to stay with me)
I wanna feel you
('Cause it's alright with me)
I wanna love baby
(Listen baby, I wanna go with you)
(I want you to stay with me)
