Gettin' so tired of loneliness gettin' tired
Lonely
I wanted to hear you say what oughtta be the- truth
But you never said the words around me would ya be my one and- only
I'm guessing you don't remember so what's the- use
Like a show downtown with the words around would ya- find me
I wanted to hear you say what oughtta be the- truth
You never said the words around me would ya be my one and- only
I'm bettin' you don't remember so what's the- use

Ohhhhhhhh feel it in the bottom of the lonely sea
Ohhhhhhhh feel it in the bottom of the lonely sea

I wanted to make a mention of a- man
I know it's strange but I'm falling through the- sand
A lonely heart that's beating twice as- loud
I'm guessing you don't remember so what's the- use

It's in my blood It's in my- Ohhhhhhhh feel it in the bottom of the lonely sea (that loneliness is in my blood)
It's in my blood
Ohhhhhhhh feel it in the bottom of the lonely sea (that loneliness is in my blood)
It's in my blood
Ohhhhhhhh feel it in the bottom of the lonely sea (that loneliness)
