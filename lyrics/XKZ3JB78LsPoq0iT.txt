"Abandoning the powers that gave them sight
Summoned to the altars of their loving gods"

Storming the walls, once built with pride
Swarming like rats away from the lights
Howling for justice, death in their eyes
Tearing down the pillars with monstrous hate

Forging the swords to slay their own kin
Screaming in triumph, burning inside

When the steps are fulfilled
We shall see a new dawn
When the dead world is gone
We shall rebuild the walls

When all the bricks from the morning
When they are once again found
We will emerge from the ashes
And rise from the ground
