They say I'm fucking crazy
Stupid, also lazy
Truth is it don't phase me
Cause bitch I might be
You'll never meet another mother fucker like me

I'll never change who I am
Love it or leave it don't be tripping cause we ain't the same
I'll never change who I am
Talk all the shit but acting different when we face to face

They say I'm fucking worthless
No future and no purpose
Just a damaged person
Yeah bitch I might be
You'll never meet another mother fucker like me

Just another bad seed from a good garden
No good low life with the blade sharpened
Write a check with my mouth and cash it no fronting
So don't be coming around unless you want to start something

Bitch I'll cut you
Bitch I'll cut you
Bitch I'll cut you
Wide open

They say I'm fucking crazy
Stupid, also lazy
Truth is it don't phase me
Cause bitch I might be
You'll never meet another mother fucker like me

Bitch I'll cut you
Bitch I'll cut you
Bitch I'll cut you
Wide open
