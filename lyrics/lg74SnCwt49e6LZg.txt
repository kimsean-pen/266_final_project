You called and then you missed my birthday
You've gone and left me on my own
I'm home, don't stay, it's cool anyway
It's not so bad to stay at home

Is it true that it's me?
You can say all the things you want to
But you don't need to leave if you take all this weight behind me
Let it go
Now it's you
You forget all the things you want to
You're not here in the end
You have nothing left to say

I guess it passed me on my birthday
You slept right through the year I've grown
And now I can't remember anyway
I need to wash my hands real slow

Is it true that it's me?
You can say all the things you want to
But you don't need to leave if you take all this weight behind me
Let it go
Now it's you
You forget all the things you want to
You're not here in the end
So there's nothing left to say

You called and then you missed my birthday
I know we'd do it all again
(?)
This time I close my eyes and really wish you'd come

Is it true that it's me?
You can say all the things you want to
But you don't need to leave if you take all this weight behind me
Let it go
Now it's you
You forget all the things you want to
You're not here in the end
So there's nothing left to say
