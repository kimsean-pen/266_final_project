I don't care about Rock 'n' Roll
I don't care about Beat or Soul
I never had a hope, never had a chance
Nobody ever taught me to begin to understand
Never had a hope, never had a chance
But it's alright
I don't care about having a ball
I don't care about nothing at all
I never had a hope, never had a chance
Nobody ever taught me to begin to understand
Never had a hope, never had a chance
But it's alright
Cos baby I don't care
No baby I don't care
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
It's all the same 'cos
I Dont care about you
