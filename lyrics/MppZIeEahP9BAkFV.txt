Pour up
Got me soaring through the city and the night
Someone on my shoulder keeps on saying I'm all right
I'm just trying to find something to bring me back to life
Can you bring me back to life
Can you bring me back to life
Diamonds on me dancing
See them waving in the light
Perfect in the darkness
Just like all your favorite lies
I'm just trying to find something to bring me back to life
Can you bring me back to life
Can you bring me back to life
Yeah
I'm in the shit with my op
I got my reasons to stop now
You swallow the key to the lock
Always come through all the spots now
I see the way that they talk
Like Get the fuck off of my yatch now
Someone just pour me a shot
Im breaking through my mental block now
I'm over 10 for the whole night
You know the way
what it goes like
You know my heart
what it froze like
Jump out the window
no low heights
Call on the phone
off a coke high
Don't have the time
I just float by
Loosing my mind
how it go by
Closing my eyes
Under strobe lights
Pour up a cup and I'm leaning
Talking with all of my demons
I got my reasons for screaming
Swimming my way through the deepend
I guess it's part of the weekends
I guess I'm tired of speaking
Tired of hiding and seeking
You were my favorite weakness
Pour up
Got me soaring through the city and the night
Someone on my shoulder keeps on saying I'm all right
I'm just trying to find something to bring me back to life
Can you bring me back to life
Can you bring me back to life
Diamonds on me dancing
See them waving in the light
Perfect in the darkness
Just like all your favorite lies
I'm just trying to find something to bring me back to life
Can you bring me back to life
Can you bring me back to life
Yeah
She like it wet
Let it soak
Leaving my marks on her throat
Now
I got my reasons to cope
Now Everyone looking to scope
Round
Give me a scare on the back
Yeah
Dropping me throwing me racks
Yeah
Make me get over attached
yeah
Then leave me and never come back
Yeah
I'm over 10 for the whole night
You know the way
what it goes like
You know my heart
what it froze like
Jump out the window
no low heights
Call on the phone
off a coke high
Don't have the time
I just float by
Loosing my mind
how it go by
Closing my eyes
Under strobe lights
Pour up a cup and I'm leaning
Talking with all of my demons
I got my reasons for screaming
Swimming my way through the deepend
I guess it's part of the weekends
I guess I'm tired of speaking
Tired of hiding and seeking
You were my favorite weakness
Pour up
Got me soaring through the city and the night
Someone on my shoulder keeps on saying I'm all right
