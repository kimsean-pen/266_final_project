I'm a wrong that'll taste,
sweet as the lies that'll drive her insane,
she want validating, way to ur place,
all u have r some lines that u regurgitate
Yeah
She ain't cut out for your good time or
your nightlife but she down so she might try
She might conjure up a white lie for you
She just wanna look like a fun time to you
She just wanna be your playroom that you turn to
when the sun down, when you wanna turn down,
when you burnt out, keep some loud for you back at her house yeah
She jus wanna be your dream girl, real cool, never be a mean girl,
never call like why you with that one
girl? She don't wanna be like them girls

Hey look I'm so different
Watch me fight all of my instincts for you
I'm so cool yeah
Hey look I'm so different
Watch how well I handle distance for you

Why don't I give you a welcome tour?
I got my brain right here I keep my heart next door and I
keep it chained down all it do it coerce, manipulate some more
Cloud my reason, treason, where the remorse?
If it break out, man down, I couldn't perform
He a sadist, it's the only explanation,
wear my smile out glue it up for decoration
Overindulged now I'm sulking in probation,
tried to abstain but I'm prone to misbehaving
Forbidden fruit call me eve if you please,
ain't your fountain of youth tho, i'm drained to say the least
I'm the beauty I'm the beast, it depends on the feast
I'm a beauty i'm a beast, it depends on the feast

For you
