These perplexing times need accompanying instructions
To show me how I can build a future

It's delicate
So fragile
I'm not up to much cause it feels like...

An apocalyptic novelty revolution;
Not a care in the world
Put your feet up and download

Born into what I would call comfortable has
Drained all the fight from my gut
I can't become what I want to be now
Cause I have everything I want

Oh isn't it lovely when I'm not doing
Anything important
Mooching off the government
All I keep on thinking is man I need a job
When I grow up if that day comes

I need colour
I need colour
I need colour

For my love
Oh she's right here
She's with me

I need colour
