Given decision to live
Not taken
The flight towards the light
I'll stay in the lava for life
Erupting when gods take us all
Changing the peaks makes us pour
From the mountain and burn
The path of our time
Hail people of Iceland
Journey of a land anew
Ram as our liaison
Vision inspire and move
Awe holy island
Breed the lagoon to run free
Raw beauty is ruthless within the golden ring
Precision of Grungir
Spear of the Norse God Odin
Praise our Pagan Father
Founder of the Althing

Given decision to live
Not taken
The flight towards the light
I'll stay in the lava for life
Erupting when gods take us all
Changing the peaks makes us pour
From the mountain and burn
The path of our time
Ruler of sky's thunder
The honourable warrior
All divination
Beward the Hammer of Thor
Lava goddess
Ice and fire
Settling down
Ocean Geysir
Gullfoss
