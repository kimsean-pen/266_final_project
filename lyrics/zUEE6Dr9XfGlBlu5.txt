Apple and pear trees were a-blooming,
Rastsvetali iabloni i grushi,
Mist (was) creeping on the river.
Poplyli tumany nad rekoj.
Katyusha set out on the banks,
Vykhodila na bereg Katyusha,
On the steep and lofty bank.
Na vysokij bereg na krutoj.
She was walking, singing a song
Vykhodila, pesniu zavodila
About a grey steppe eagle,
Pro stepnogo, sizogo orla,
About her true love,
Pro togo, kotorogo liubila,
Whose letters she was keeping.
Pro togo, chi pisma beregla.
Oh you song! Little song of a maiden,
Oj ty, pesnia, pesenka devichia,
Head for the bright sun.
Ty leti za iasnym solntsem vsled.
And reach for the soldier on the far-away border
I bojtsu na dalnem pograniche
Along with greetings from Katyusha.
Ot Katyushi peredaj privet.
Let him remember an ordinary girl,
Pust on vspomnit devushku prostuiu,
And hear how she sings,
Pust uslyshit, kak ona poet,
Let him preserve the Motherland,
Pust on zemliu berezhet rodnuiu,
Same as Katyusha preserves their love.
A liubov Katyusha sberezhet.
