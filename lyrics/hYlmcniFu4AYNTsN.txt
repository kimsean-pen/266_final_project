Vacuum of god

Gobbets of me
wrapped in tissue through the side blow
that had somehow slipped from you

Vacuum of god
and there you go

I nursed you like a crown
hanging upside down
half of a bit, drown
My life weeping to your feet
on gallows of love

Tear a kiss
into a lie of bliss

Shouts with a voice you can't hear
for what you can't bear
from world's void juice
emptied by words

Vacuum of god
and there you go

From world's void juice
emptied by words
