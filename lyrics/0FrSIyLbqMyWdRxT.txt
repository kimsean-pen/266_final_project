I can feel it on the back of my tongue
All of the words getting trapped in my lungs
Heavy like a stone, waiting for the river to run

I wanna lash out
I wanna let it out
'Cause I can feel it on the back of my tongue
On the back of my tongue

Oh, hard to hold this fire inside me
All I know, sometimes it's frightening
Hard to hold this fire inside me
Oh, oh oh, it's not really like me to lash out

I gotta let it out
I wanna lash out
I wanna lash out

I've got something to say, might start a riot
Rip that tape from my mouth, I won't be quiet
'Cause everything is nothing 'til you realise it's something you want

I wanna lash out
I wanna let it out
'Cause I can feel it on the back of my tongue
On the back of my tongue

Oh, hard to hold this fire inside me
All I know, sometimes it's frightening
Hard to hold this fire inside me
Oh, oh oh, it's not really like me to lash out
I gotta let it out
I wanna lash out
I gotta let it out

I can't be the cork, come out of the bottle
I can't be the cork, come out of the bottle
I can't be the cork, come out of the bottle
I can't be the cork, come out of the bottle

Lash out
I wanna let it out
'Cause I can feel it on the back of my tongue
On the back of my tongue

Oh, hard to hold this fire inside me
All I know, sometimes it's frightening
Hard to hold this fire inside me
Oh, oh oh, it's not really like me to lash out

I wanna let it out
I wanna lash out
I wanna let it out
I gotta lash out
