Today I woke up and you were gone
The whole day wondering what I did wrong
It's like I'm falling from a, a mountaintop
My heart keeps pounding and it won't stop

Can you see this, hell I'm leaving?
I'm not giving up

Will you crawl to me?
Will you fall with me?
I'll never crawl to you
I've done it all for you

(Don't deny) Well, don't deny
The hand that feeds you, needs you
(Don't deny) Oh God I'd die to try to
Finally please you

There goes a piece of me
Will I cease to be?
I've never lied to you
Fought, bled and died for you

(Don't deny) Well, don't deny
The hand that takes you, breaks you
(Don't deny) Oh God I'd died to try to
Finally please you

There she goes, I'm on the ground
I'm on the ground, (I'm on the ground)
There she goes, I'm on the ground
I'm on the ground, I'm on the

There she goes and I'm on the ground
I'm on the ground, I'm on the
There she goes and I'm on the ground
I'm on the ground, I'm on the

Well, don't deny
The hand that feeds you, needs you
(There she goes) Oh God I'd die to try to
Finally please you

Will you crawl to me?
Will you fall with me?
I'll never crawl to you
I've done it all for you
