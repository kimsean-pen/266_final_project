Downtown we'll drown
We're in our never splendor
Flowers
Showers
Who's got the new boy gender

I'll be your baby
I'll be your score
I'll run the gun for you
And so much more

I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble for you
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 ya

I'll tumble...
Uptown their sound
Is like the native
You send her
Junction
Function

The boy with pop is slender
Did he say maybe
Or I'm not sure
He'll be a boy for you

But you need more
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 you
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 ya

I'll tumble...
I get a crazy feeling
That chases in my head
It's nothing that you do to me
It's nothing that you said
It's love in stereo

And when I can't let go I say
I'll be your baby
I'll be your score
I'll run the gun for you

And so much more
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 you
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 ya

I'll tumble...
Downtown we'll drown
We're in our never splendor
Flowers
Showers

Who's got the new boy gender
I'll be your baby
I'll be your score
I'll run the gun for you
And so much more
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 you
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble...
