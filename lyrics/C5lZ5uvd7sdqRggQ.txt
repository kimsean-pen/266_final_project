Time to believe in the dream that you've seen
In a world that is broken and mean
One day the sun it will shine for us all
Take the freedom that you have foreseen

Oh, miles away, you're heading for the unknown
And there's no way to get back
Time to complain, nobody is telling the truth
To live in the crowd, sick of your own vanity
Dead scattered petals around
Hymns of betrayal calling you back for attack

Evil warning
You're much too fast and much too high
No time to worry!
It's over, no more remaining time to cry and
Feel the pain
In the morning
You stagger up to start the fight
You get so lonely
With no foresight until another day!

Run, don't wait the sun
Cause it's setting on your hopes
Don't look far behind
For the shadows they still stand
Until the end!

Time to believe in the dream that you've seen
In a world that is broken and mean
One day the sun it will shine for us all
Take the freedom that you have foreseen

Time to believe in the dream that you've seen
In a world that is broken and mean
One day the sun it will shine for us all
Take the freedom that you have foreseen

Evil warning
You're much too fast and much too high
No time to worry!
It's over, no more remaining time to cry and
Feel the pain

Run, don't wait the sun
Cause it's setting on your hopes
Don't look far behind
For the shadows they still stand
Until the end!

Then don't let your pride
Make your blood flow on in vain
Until the end...
