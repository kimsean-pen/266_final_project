I should laugh, but I cry
Because your love has passed me by
You took me by surprise
You didn't realize that I was waiting

Time goes slowly but carries on
And now the best years have come and gone
You took me by surprise
I didn't realize that you were Laughing

Laughing -- the things you're doin' to me
Laughing -- that ain't the way it should be
You took away everything I had
You put the hurt on me

Laughing -- the things you're doin' to me
Laughing -- that ain't the way it should be
You took away everything I had
You put the hurt on me

I go alone now, calling your name
After losing at the game
You took me by surprise
I didn't realize that you were Laughing

Time goes slowly, but carries on
And now the best years, the best years have come and gone
You took me by surprise
I didn't realize, that you were Laughing
Laughing -- the things you're doin' to me

Laughing -- that ain't the way it should be
You took away everything I had
You put the hurt on me
Laughing -- the things you're doin' to me

Laughing -- oh, what you're doin' to me
You took away everything I had
You put the hurt on me
Oo!

Laughing -- ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Laughing -- ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Laughing -- well, you're laughin' at me
Laughing -- well, you're laughin' at me
Laughing -- oh, what you're doin' to me, girl
Laughing -- I'm a-lookin', you're laughin'
Laughing -- I'm a-lookin', you're laughin'
Laughing -- you're a-lookin', I'm a-laughin'
Laughing -- laughin' at me
Laughing -- ah, but you're a-laughin', baby
Laughing
