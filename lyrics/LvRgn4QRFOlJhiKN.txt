Pick up the fuckin phone
I need a warmth of your tone
Got my first 20 just to smoke it up alone

This is isolation
This is demon bliss
Could I reach for her kiss
Could I reach for her kiss

If I'm swum baby it's not your fault
I always sunk, I always sunk
You ain't used to a boy who bleeds to the moon
It ain't your fault, I'd sink in salt
Scarlet fingers I could move through you
But to drown you to disgrace fume

This is isolation
This is demonic bliss
Could I reach for her kiss
Could I reach for her kiss

Rhetoric verses I could spill
Only to find myself to limbo wish
This is whisky
This is ocean bed
Baby let it take me instead
Let it take me instead
