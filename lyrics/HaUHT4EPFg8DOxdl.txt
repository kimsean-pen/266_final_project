So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here, you leave me broken shattered I lie
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot then we can die
I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say, don't you know?
You say, you don't know
I say, take me out!
I say, you don't show
Don't move, time is slow
I say, take me out!
Well I say, don't you know?
You say, you don't go
I say, take me out!

If I move this could die
Eyes move this can die
I want you to take me out

I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say, don't you know?
You say, you don't know
I say, take me out!

If I wane this could die
I wait this could die
I want you to take me out
If I move this could die
Eyes move this can die
Come on, take me out

I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here with you
