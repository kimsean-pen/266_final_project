Lock it all away and take this night to the grave
Devil's grip hold, wearing my skin
They're wearing my skin, I've let them in
As the night takes hold, I'm forced to let it begin
Your razor wire tongue leaves me paralysed
Cold sweat erodes my burning eyes
Your bleached claws crawl, crawl over me
Midnight runs through me

Are you with me? The night will only tear us apart
So put your arms around me, I'll follow you into the dark
I'll follow you into the dark, I'll follow you into the dark

We are now as one, the final act has begun
Devil's all surround, wearing my skin
They're wearing my skin, I've let them in
As the night takes hold, I'm forced to let it begin, go

Midnight, let it begin
Midnight, let it begin

Are you with me? The night will only tear us apart
So put your arms around me, I'll follow you into the dark
I'll follow you into the dark, I'll follow you into the dark

I'm sorry to myself and all those around
As the clock spins right from cradle to ground
These scars won't fade, I bare all to see
I'll never lift this curse you've left on me
You've left on me
You've left on me

Midnight, let it begin
Midnight, let it begin

Are you with me? The night will only tear us apart
So put your arms around me, I'll follow you into the dark
I'll follow you into the dark, I'll follow you into the dark
I'll follow you into the dark, I'll follow you into the dark
