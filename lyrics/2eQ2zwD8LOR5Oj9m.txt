It's the same old story all over again
You turn a lover into just another friend
I wanna love you, I wanna make you mine
Won't you lay it on the line

I'm tired of playin' foolish games
I'm tired of all your lies makin' me insane
I don't ask for much, truth will do just fine
Won't you lay it on the line

Lay it on the line
Lay it on the line
Lay it on the line
Don't waste my time

You got no right to make me wait
Better talk girl before it gets too late
I never ever thought you could be so unkind
Won't you lay it on the line

Lay it on the line
Lay it on the line
Lay it on the line
Don't waste my time

You know I love you, you know it's true
It's up to you, girl, now what have I got to do
Don't hold me up, girl, don't waste my precious time
Won't you lay it on the line

Lay it on the line
Lay it on the line
Lay it on the line
Lay it on the line

Don't hold me up, girl
Lay it on the line
Yeah, yeah
Lay it on the line

Lay it on the line, girl
Lay it on the line
Oh, don't hold me up, girl
Lay it on the line

Lay it on the line
Lay it on the line
Lay it on the line
