I smoked a pack of cigarettes before midday
I coughed up a lung around one
I can't see a thing through my eyes that sting
I can't remember having so much fun

Well I've never had so much fun
No I've never had so much fun
I can't remember when I've ever had so much fun

Can't drink the water in Sydney
Can't eat the food in Japan
And you can't breath the air in Los Angeles
But a million people think they can

And I've never had so much fun
No I've never had so much fun
I can't remember when I've ever had so much fun

These wankers filled up with hatred
Why expect any less
They can't decide about genocide
I think it's time that they took a rest

And I've never had so much fun
No I've never had so much fun
I can't remember when I've ever had so much fun

I try to compensate blindly for mistakes
Try to make things right
For all my redemption I've the best intentions
But it's always ending up in a fight

And I've never had so much fun
No I've never had so much fun
I can't remember when I've ever had so much
I can't remember when I've ever had so much
I can't remember when I've ever had so much fun
I can't remember when I've ever had so much fun
