Paterson and Leo
Are wandering out
And wandering around
In Brookdale at sundown
They're looking for
Well, they're still looking
Here's another place in our town
Here's a loophole, here's a steeple
Here's another underwater
Here's our friendship
Why I oughta
Why I love you
Enough to say it
Thank you Paterson
Thank you Leo
Thank you Paterson
Thank you Leo
