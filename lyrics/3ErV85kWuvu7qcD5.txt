I been waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you
One hundred bottles of the good shit, couldn't even bring you back
What am I to do?
Feel like I'm circlin' a drain
All I see is the remains of an ugly truth
One hundred models I could follow all the way to hell and back
But they can't replace you

Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh

I was puttin' on for you like a jersey
What I didn't know then couldn't hurt me
Never thought you were gonna do me dirty
Left me in the cold, but on the inside I was burnin'
But that's just the way it goes
Wish that I could have control
Everybody dies alone
(And I ain't dead yet)

Say my prayers
But I lost faith a long time ago
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope

I don't even wonder why you don't answer
When I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

I'm still waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you (take me right to you)
One hundred vials of denial, I know they won't bring you back
What am I to do? (what am I to do?)
You're my alibi and motive
When I'm lyin' to myself of the ugly truth (what an ungly truth)
We're no strangers to the flame
We will never be the same if we make it through
(And we can make it through)

My back is up against the wall
But I used to feel invincible
Yeah, it was us against the world
But somehow, someway, the take was comin'
I remember back then
Played my cards right you were my best hand
Still you keep me guessin'
Wonder if I'll ever get the message

Say my prayers
But I lost faith a long time ago
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope

I don't even wonder why you don't answer
When I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

(Are you on the other side? Will you save us?)
(Or will you run away?)
