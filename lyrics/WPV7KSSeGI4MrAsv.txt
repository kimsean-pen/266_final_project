Perfect little houses
It's family fun time, let's commit a hate crime
Perfect little spouses in perfect little houses
It's family fun time, let's commit a hate crime

Perfect little spouses in perfect little houses
It's family fun time, let's commit a hate crime
Perfect little spouses in perfect little houses
It's family fun time, let's commit a hate crime

If I can't be loved, then I'll be hated

I'm disconnected, I'm uninspired
I'm burning in water, I'm drowning in fire

I'm trapped inside my mind
Beneath these piles of stinking life
You use this abuse to keep me conquered
You're so absurdly common

Vacant faces, brainless strangers

Sputtering, stuttering insect language
I'm the creature you created
Every day I grow jaded, calloused and exasperated
If I'll never be loved, then I'll be hated

I'm one of the freaks, the faggots
The geeks, the savages
Rogues, rebels, dissident devils
Artists, martyrs, infidels

Do we sit still under attack
Or do we start pushing back?
Never back up, never back down and fight

Rise, rebel, resist
Rise, rebel, make a fist, resist
Rise, rebel, resist
Rise, rebel, make a fist, resist

I'm human pollution, I covet retribution
I'm just a big mistake, a defect you can subjugate
Your ridicule is just typical antics
Spineless, mindless, tragic, fanatic

Puritan, bigot, lunatic, hypocrite
To save my soul from disaster
Self-destruction could be the answer
If I'll never be loved, then I'll be hated

I'm one of the freaks, the faggots
The geeks, the savages
Rogues, rebels, dissident devils
Artists, martyrs, infidels

Do we sit still under attack
Or do we start pushing back?
Never back up, never back down and fight

Rise, rebel, resist
Rise, rebel, make a fist, resist
Rise, rebel, resist
Rise, rebel, make a fist, resist

Masochistic, so sadistic
All they see is another statistic
Maybe I'm a misfit, maybe I'm different
It will never be an average existence

Masochistic, so sadistic
All they see is another statistic
If I can't be loved, then I'll be hated

It's family fun time, let's commit a hate crime
War, war

Rise, rebel, resist
Rise, rebel, make a fist, resist
Rise, rebel, resist
Rise, rebel, make a fist, resist

We are the freaks, the faggots
The geeks, the savages
Rogues, rebels, dissident devils
Artists, martyrs, infidels

Do we sit still under attack
Or do we start pushing back?
Never back up, never back down and fight

War, war
Resist
