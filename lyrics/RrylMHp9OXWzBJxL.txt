Chatty Chatty Mouth

"Hey mister chatty mouth!"

Chatty chatty mouth,
You want to know your culture
(know your culture)

Your boss is a warrior
Chatty mouth you are a traitor
You both belittle humble
Also fight against the meek.

But I and I and I
By the power of Jah-I
We shall overcome
One fine day

Chatty chatty mouth
Be wise and know your culture
(know your culture)

Your boss shall be lost
And you Chatty Mouth you get blow
Remember Jah say
"The humble of the meek they shall prevail"

"Hey Mister Chatty Mouth,
You'll get blow
If you won't hear!"

So I and I and I
By the power of Jah-I
We shall overcome
One fine day

Chatty chatty mouth
Be wise and know your culture
(know your culture)

You and your boss shall be lost
If you won't hear
You will get blow

You shall be weighed in the balance
And found wanting
(found wanting)
you shall be run into Jah saying:
"It isn't I who have done so and so"
But Jah shall say
"Depart from I, I know you not"

And won't you hear me:
Chatty chatty mouth,
Be wise and know your culture...
