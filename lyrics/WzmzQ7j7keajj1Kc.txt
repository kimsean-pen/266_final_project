But you're but you're such a good talker
Oh-whoa

Well I know we should take a walk
But you're such a fast walker, oh-whoa,
Well alright

I know where I'll be tonight, alright
Outta mind outta site

Well okay
I know you don't love me
But you'll still be thinking of me, oh-whoa

Well alright
I know you probably hate me
That's okay with me
Alright!

I know where I'll be tonight, alright
Outta mind outta site
Outta mind outta site

You don't want to anyhow

Look out

And I'm bringing my friends

Look out

Okay, alright, okay alright!
