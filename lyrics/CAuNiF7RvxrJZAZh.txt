Would you butcher my love, to understand it
To know where it lies
Cut a hole in my heart
Fill the hole in your life
I'm yours to dissect

Now does every heartbeat
Burn white heat in your blood

The tissue and bone, my soul has on loan
Aches to be near you
Are you listening carefully
Then we shall begin

Now does every heartbeat
Burn white heat in your blood
I hope it doesn't matter
I hope we swim up out of this flood

Of formaldehyde (I'll never let you go)
Formaldehyde (until the end of time)
Formaldehyde (I'll never let you go)
Formaldehyde (my formaldehyde)

Smother my love, entertain it
My mind's gonna wander
Are you listening carefully
Then we shall begin

Now does every heartbeat
Burn white heat in your blood
I hope it doesn't matter
I hope we swim up out of this flood

Of formaldehyde (I'll never let you go)
Formaldehyde (until the end of time)
Formaldehyde (I'll never let you go)
Formaldehyde (my formaldehyde)

I'm lost in a love that's a mile wide
Drowned in a bath of formaldehyde

Now does every heartbeat
Burn white heat in your blood
I hope it doesn't matter
I hope we swim up out of this flood

Of formaldehyde (I'll never let you go)
Formaldehyde (until the end of time)
Formaldehyde (I'll never let you go)
Formaldehyde (my formaldehyde)

Formaldehyde (I'll never let you go)
Formaldehyde (until the end of time)
Formaldehyde (I'll never let you go)
Formaldehyde (my formaldehyde)

I'm lost in a love that's a mile wide
Drowned in a bath of formaldehyde
I'm lost in a love
