Oh, you and me, we're the same
Asking for more than the numbing existence
Offered us all
What did they say? What did they do?
To make you crawl back in
Despite everything that you've been through
You're still right where I left you
We can lift up our hands to the sky
Find all of those strings that they're pulling and keep from falling back
Into our old rhythmic poses
Turning us into machines

And one of these days we'll no longer betray ourselves
In any way we won't all look the same way down
And one of these days we'll no longer betray ourselves
In any way and we'll all take the same way out

And all these illusions dropped on a sea of believers
Crowding around as they hunt me down
And throw me out
While all the rest of the others
Bang their heads in the dredges

And one of these days we'll no longer betray ourselves
In any way we won't all look the same way down
And one of these days we'll no longer betray ourselves
In any way and we'll all take the same way out

So don't give up on me
We can be still pretend
This is all just a game
That'll work itself out in the end
