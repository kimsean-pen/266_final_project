Heed
Judgement always comes to the one guilty in mind
Deeds of anguish results in failure condemn the mind to oblivion

Bound in flames

Bound in flames

All is not what it seems
Ideas rebel my common sense
Straining my inner peace to set my soul ablaze

Now all my guilt slowly breeds in me
Screaming voices telling me to burn, scorch my soul
All my tears rain like embers on barren soil
The ashes will tell the tale of how the flames consumed me

Feed
I present my soul to the void to feast upon
Thoughts of dread all painted red, the kindling to my tormention

Bound in flames

Bound in flames

All is not what it seems ideas rebel my common sense
Straining my inner peace to set my soul ablaze

Now all my guilt slowly breeds in me
Screaming voices telling me to burn, scorch my soul
All my tears rain like embers on barren soil
The ashes will tell the tale of how the flames consumed me
