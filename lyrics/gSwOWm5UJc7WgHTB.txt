What has come over me?
What madness taken
Hold of my heart
To run away, the only answer
Pulling me away
To fall upon (the night)
The source of my recovery
Sweet shadow taking
Hold of the light
Another day
Has been devoured
Calling me away
Begging a question why

For saving me from
All they've taken
Letting my armor fall again
Giving me the strength
To face them
Feeling it taking over
Now on a path
To take it all away
There can be

No better way of knowing

In a world beyond controlling
Are you gonna deny
The saviour in front of your eyes?
Stare into the night
Power beyond containing
Are you going to remain a slave

For the rest of your life?
Give in to the night

This self discovery
Redemption taking
Hold of my mind
A serenade of haunting voices
Calling me away
To feast upon (the night)
The source of my felicity
Dark maiden
Taking hold of my hand
Lead me away

From hibernation
Strong and unafraid
Never a question, why?

For saving me from
All they've taken
Letting my armor fall again
Giving me the strength
To face them
Feeling it taking over

Now on a path
To take it all away
There can be
No better way of knowing

In a world beyond controlling
Are you gonna deny
The saviour in front of your eyes?

Stare into the night
Power beyond containing
Are you going to remain a slave
For the rest of your life?
Give in to the night

Give in to the night
In a world beyond controlling
Are you gonna deny
The saviour in front of your eyes?
Stare into the night
Power beyond containing
Are you gonna remain a slave
For the rest of your life?
Give in to the night
Night
Night
Night
Give in to the night
Night
Night
Night
Give in to the night,
Give in to the night
