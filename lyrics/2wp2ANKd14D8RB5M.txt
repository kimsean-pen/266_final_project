We used to dream, we used to name the stars
Tracing futures, lying in the dark
They said we'd never last
The brightest flame burns fast
We say words, but we don't talk anymore

Tonight we're growing closer
Closer to the end
Were we fools for each other?
Or fools for falling in?
Are we looking at forever?
'Cause I don't see it in your eyes
Have you had enough or do we try again?
The glass was half full and we stopped pouring in
So just say when

I've seen that sunset in your eyes again
I got that sinking, sinking, same feeling
They said we'd never last
They were right but I can't help looking back

Oh, tonight we're growing closer
Closer to the end
Were we fools for each other?
Or fools for falling in?
Are we looking at forever?
'Cause I don't see it in your eyes
Have you had enough or do we the try again?
The glass was half full and we stopped pouring in
And just say when

Oh oh, we keep circling, it never ends
We keep breaking down but never bend
Oh, we've been half alive
We've been half alive for way too long

Tonight we're growing closer
Closer to the end
Were we fools for each other?
Or fools for falling in?
Are we looking at forever
'Cause I don't see it in your eyes
Have you had enough or do we try again?
The glass was half full and we stopped pouring in
So just say when
Just say when
