Ugh

Sweet Lord, please have mercy
Baby Jesus, please save us
I know I used up my three favors
Back to sinning like a week later
New car, speed racer
Cop a crib, need acres
Most of all, we all need prayer
Karma coming, beware

I don't know where I'm goin' (Huh)
But I hope I'm on the right path
Life'll hit you with a light jab
Mike Tyson, strike back
You niggas going out slight sad
Know I'm all about my bag
New drip, I grab
I just wanna get my life back

There's no complaining on this side
My niggas, shit is not tolerated
Cut some niggas off like a operation
And my team way more consolidated
Suite presidential, that's inauguration
'Cause we cooking crack like Ronald Reagan
Chip on my shoulder, boy, I'm not for waiting
Divine timing, took a lot of patience
Now it's time for the takeover
All gas and the brake's slower
Took a trip out to Tokyo
Now I'm here in Paris for the layover
Fuck old niggas, boy, your day's over
You're mad at me because your pace slower
Bitter nigga, you a shade-thrower
I was just sleeping on a sofa
Now I ride with a paid chauffeur
Because I'm way doper, better stay sober
I paint pictures, you a Crayola
I got a bad bitch and she laid over
She really asked could she stay over?
I told her that we needed face closure
This mellow money has a great odor
These the things that I prayed over

Sweet Lord, please have mercy
Baby Jesus, please save us
I know I used up my three favors
Back to sinning like a week later
New car, speed racer
Cop a crib, need acres
Most of all, we all need prayer
Karma coming, beware

I don't know where I'm going (Huh)
But I hope I'm on the right path
Life'll hit you with a light jab
Mike Tyson, strike back
You niggas going out slight sad
Know I'm all about my bag
New drip, I grab
I just wanna get my life back
(Huh, huh)

Why cry over spilled milk
If you still feel I'm the real deal?
My bitch bad with no ill-will
'Cause she'll murk a nigga like Kill Bill
Loose lips, sink ships
Cam'ron pink drip, that is my fashion
I'm not really with the high flashing
It's not helping with my bragging
I penetrate it, been the greatest
New house, renovate it
I got the juice you eliminated
Pussy-niggas always instigate it
Can't fuck me over boy
I'm too clever, that applies all to whoever
I'm just here to pursue pleasure
Boy, I'm going out like Hugh Hefner

Sweet Lord, please have mercy
Baby Jesus, please save us
I know I used up my three favors
Back to sinning like a week later
New car, speed racer
Cop a crib, need acres
Most of all, we all need prayer
Karma coming, beware

I don't know where I'm going (Huh)
But I hope I'm on the right path
Life'll hit you with a light jab
Mike Tyson, strike back
You niggas going out slight sad
Know I'm all about my bag
New drip, I grab
I just wanna get my life back

Baby Jesus, please save us
