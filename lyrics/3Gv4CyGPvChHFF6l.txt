I fell down the rabbit hole
Ring in hand
My mind was full
Winged bird
I love you

With toasting hands
We're circling the tangled vine
Of the morning glory
Sugar cake and apple wine
I love you
I love you

So go, and berate us
So go, underrate us
So go, and berate us

Vinyl skin
And the machinery within
Was beating like a mindless clock
Like thunder
And I recall
The moment that the coppice became a golden glade
My eyes went wet like rainfall

So go, and berate us
So go, underrate us
So go, and berate us.
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
