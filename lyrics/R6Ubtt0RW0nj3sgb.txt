You call me out of my slumber
Like a ghost laying down in my bed
Fill my room with lightning and thunder
Make your veins run hard on my chest
But in the morning when the sun hits my eyes
The memories of you will disappear into the night

When you rolled, your heart is hardly beating
But it's hard to know when you're young
I'll never forget loving you sweetly
Your sugar still burns on my tongue

Your sugar still burns
Your love still hurts

I tried so hard to escape you
But I found out there's nowhere to run
It's too easy to love and to hate you
Oh, my healing has only begun

When you rolled, your heart is hardly beating
But it's hard to know when you're young (when you're young)
I'll never forget loving you sweetly
Your sugar still burns on my tongue

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Your sugar still burns
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Your love still hurts
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Your sugar still burns
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Your love still hurts

Every night you trick me into your arms
But you never stay, when I awake, no
Every time I feel your thoughts alone
And it's such a shame, you were gone so long

When you rolled, your heart is hardly beating (oh yeah)
But it's hard to know when you're young (when you're young)
I'll never forget loving you sweetly
Your sugar still burns on my tongue
Your sugar still burns on my tongue
