Talking about our relationship
What you know it is always different from mine

What you saw it was always different from mine
You gonna call it's not my name
You can feel or notice now
This time I do not belong to you
Talking about our relationship
What you know it is always different from mine
(Solo)
You gonna call it's not my name
You can feel or notice now
This time I do not belong to you
You gonna call it's not my name
You can feel or notice now
This time I do not belong to you
