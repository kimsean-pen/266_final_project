I'm in trouble now
Wanna have your way?
I wanna show you how
Want it every day
And I want it now!
When you going up
I'm going down

You know how I feel
Come inside
It's no big deal
Hot like wax or rays sunbeam
Whip you into shape
Like you're whipped cream

Cause that's how I roll
Do whatever
I won't tell a soul
I can ride around that pole
Go with the juice
Go with the flow

Holler when you want it
You know I'm down
Holler when you're on it
You know my sound
Juices move at the speed of light
Bet it all on love tonight

Baby shouldn't force it
I can feel it in pulses
She makes me impulsive
A manic touch can cause it

Juices juices!
Juices juices! tonight! I'm obsessed with you
I wanna do what you wanna do
If you want me
I wanna see it through
Turn the lights on
So we can see it too

Slow it down
Lick it that way and turn around
Like it when you say
You're in my town
Know what that means?
I can see it now

You know I'm crazy right?
Sweating on me all day and night
Don't be scared boy I don't bite
God made its feeling right?

Holler when you want it
You know I'm down
Holler when you're on it
You know my sound
Juice come out all the time
Bet it all on love tonight

Baby shouldn't force it
I can feel it in pulses
She makes me impulsive
A manic touch can cause it

Juices juices!
Juices juices! tonight!
