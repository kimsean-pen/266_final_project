it's the first time that i'm worried

cause i've never felt this way
gotta take care of what is mine
before time let us go
this is what they are

the only thing i got
i can't wait for tomorrow
cause time might be running late
so would you

say goodbye
would you

think it twice
this is what i've chosen
but only god knows i'm doing well
gotta take care of what is mine
cause tomorrow could be the end
you're always in my heart
the only thing i've got
i can't wait for tomorrow
cause time might be running late
so would you
say goodbye
would you
think it twice
this peak may seem so high
but i won't give up the fight
(and so won't you)
although i have lost my mind
i'll keep on trying
so would you
say goodbye
would you
think it twice (please)
so would you
say goodbye say good bye goodbye
would you
say goodbye
