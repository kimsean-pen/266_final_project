Slow, slow me down
Her blood, on my bones.
Let go, lay to rest.
We fall, we fall, we fall
We fall to the ground.

Sleep, sleep all night
While the young, they wait alone.
So get up, shake the rust.
We crawl, we crawl, we crawl
We crawl on the ground.

Alone, I fight these animals.
Alone, until I get home.

A wolf, wolf and I
We share, the same cold meal.

I float on, float on down.
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride it all out.
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride it all
Ride, we ride, we ride, we ride it all
Ride, we ride, we ride, we ride it all out.

Alone, I fight these animals, alone until I get home
Alone, I fight these animals, alone until I get home
Alone, I fight these animals, alone until I get home
Alone, I fight these animals, alone until I get home

Coming back, I'm coming back
Coming back, I'm coming back.
She follows me into the woods
Takes me home.
She follows me into the woods
Takes me home.

Coming back, I'm coming back
Coming back, I'm coming back
She follows me, into the woods
Takes me home

Coming back, I'm coming back
Coming back, I'm coming back
She follows me, into the woods
Takes me home

Coming back, I'm coming back
Coming back, I'm coming back
She follows me, into the woods
Takes me home
