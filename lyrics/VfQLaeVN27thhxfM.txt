"They're... They're these terrors
And it feels as if somebody was gripping my
They're these terrors. And it's like
It feels like as if somebody was gripping my throat
Like last night
They're not like tremors, they're worse than tremors
They're... They're these terrors
Like last night, they are not like tremors
They are worse than tremors
They are these terrors
And it's like, it feels like as if somebody
Was gripping my throat and squeezing and...
As if like somebody was gripping my throat"

Some say, now suffer all the children
And walk away a savior
Or a madman and polluted
From gutter institutions
Don't you breathe for me
Undeserving of your sympathy
'Cause there ain't no way that I'm sorry for what I did

And through it all, how could you cry for me?
'Cause I don't feel bad about it
So shut your eyes
Kiss me, goodbye
And sleep
Just sleep

The hardest part
Is letting go of your dreams

A drink
For the horror that I'm in
For the good guys, and the bad guys
For the monsters that I've been
Three cheers for tyranny
Unapologetic apathy
'Cause there ain't no way that I'm coming back again

And through it all, how could you cry for me?
'Cause I don't feel bad about it
So shut your eyes
Kiss me, goodbye
And sleep
Just sleep

The hardest part's
The awful things that I've seen

"Sometimes I see flames
And sometimes I see people that I love dying and
It's always..."

Just sleep
Just sleep
Just sleep
Just sleep
Just sleep
Just sleep
Wake up!

"And I can't... I can't ever wake up."
