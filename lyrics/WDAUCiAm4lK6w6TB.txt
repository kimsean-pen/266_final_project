I'll be your orthodox man when you call,
I'll be your slave your pet.
Seventh son or just your seventh fool
To make and strip the bed.

The linings in my temper worse,
Come near me and I'm sure to burst the bubble You're floating in.
So chew me up and spit me out,
Spread fear across my upper brow.
Never drown,
She keeps spinning.

Ohh, Ahh, Ahh, Ohh, Ahh, Ahh, Ohh, Ahh, Ahh
Ohhhh, Ahh, Ohhhhhh
Ohh, Ahh, Ahh, Ohh, Ahh, Ahh, Ohh, Ahh, Ahh
Ohh, Ahh, Ohh, Ohh

Baby, just call I'll be here waiting late.
Baby, just call I'll be here waiting, waiting, waiting.
Baby, just call I'll be here waiting late.
Baby, just call I'll be here waiting, waiting,
waiting.

I'll be your orthodox man when you call,
I'll light your cigarette.
One excuse is all I need to crawl up to your feet I wept.
To hear you singing in the shower,
I'll be your mat or I'll towell dry you with my bare hands.
Their soft as polars, pressing gently on your shoulders.

Never bathe, just keep singing.
Never bathe, just keep singing.

Ohh, Ahh, Ahh, Ohh, Ahh, Ahh, Ohh, Ahh, Ahh
Ohhhh, Ahh, Ohhhhhh
Ohh, Ahh, Ahh, Ohh, Ahh, Ahh, Ohh, Ahh, Ahh
Ohh, Ahh, Ohh, Ohh

Baby, just call I'll be here waiting late.
Baby, just call I'll be here waiting, waiting, waiting.
Baby, just call I'll be here waiting late.
Baby, just call I'll be here waiting, waiting,
waiting.

I'll be your orthodox man when you call,
I'll be your slave, your pet.
Seventh son or just your seventh fool,
At your feet I wept.

Baby, just call I'll be here waiting late.
Baby, just call I'll be here waiting, waiting, waiting.
Baby, just call I'll be here waiting late.
Baby, just call I'll be here waiting, waiting,
