The inevitable run-in at the bar
I was sulking and regretting going out

We got to talking and I started to feel better
That stabbing hatred for you suddenly felt softer
You said it's springtime and you're doing a bit better
You've even found yourself another lover

I guess I could find one too
I guess I could find one too

I won't play the victim just because I can't get what I want
I won't play the victim just because I can't get what I want

Isn't it nice to have a little bit of closure
Instead of talking shit and throwing a cold shoulder

I want to be nice to you
I want to be nice to you

Self destruction is so played out
So is self pity and self doubt

Let's try to be okay
Let's try to be okay

I won't play the victim just because I can't get what I want
I won't play the victim just because I can't get what I want
I won't play the victim just because I can't get what I want
I won't play the victim just because I can't get what I want
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
