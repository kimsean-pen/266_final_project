It's you over my dream frame
falling from hi-grace like myself
it's you a blue sun to stare us
breathing togheter
(in the dark)

in cold sides of my mind
i'm starting to rewind
over the golden heart that is colder
you're fading by my side
all wired i can't stop to cry
loosing my only hope in this dark dead world of rust

It's you over my dream frame
falling from hi grace like myself
it's you a blue sun to stare us
breathing togheter in the dark
it's you living for nothing
living in nowhere for my faults
it's you enjoing this decay dance
over the dance floor of my heart

in cold sides of my mind
i'm starting to rewind
over the golden heart that is colder
you're fading by my side
all wired i can't stop to cry
losing my only hope in this dark dead world of rust

in cold sides of my mind
i'm starting to rewind
over the golden heart that is colder
you're fading by my side
all wired i can't stop to cry
losing my only hope in this dark-
in cold sides of my mind
i'm starting to rewind
over the golden heart that is colder
you're fading by my side
all wired i can't stop to cry
losing my only hope in this dark deadin cold sides of my mind
i'm starting to rewind
over the golden heart that is colder
you're fading by my side
all wired i can't stop to cry
losing my only hope in this dark dead world of rust
