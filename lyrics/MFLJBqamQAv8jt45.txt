In my solitude you haunt me
with reveries of days gone by
in my solitude you taunt me
with memories that never die
i sit in my chair
filled with despair
nobody could be so sad
with gloom ev'rywhere
i sit and i stare
i know that i'll soon go mad
in my solitude
i'm praying
dear lord above
send back my love
alternative lyric:
in my solitude you haunt me
with reveries of days gone by
in my solitude you taunt me
with memories that never die
i sit in my chair
i'm filled with despair
there's no one could be so sad
with gloom ev'rywhere
i sit and i stare
i know that i'll soon go mad
in my solitude
i'm praying
dear lord above
send back my love
