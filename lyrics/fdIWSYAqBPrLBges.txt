Happiness can't stand alone
Joy, it spreads like fire
Angel trumpets and devil trombones
From chaos to harmony

Loneliness can catch us all
Love can struck like lightnin'
Angel trumpets and devil trombones

I, I leave it all behind
You can't buy no peace of mind
Did you no wrong
All it is, ever was, and ever shall be
From chaos to harmony
I'm still here singin' my song

Happiness can't stand alone
Joy, it spreads like fire
Angel trumpets and devil trombones
From chaos to harmony
Loneliness can catch us all
Love can struck like lightnin'
Angel trumpets and devil trombones

I, I leave it all behind
You can't buy no peace of mind
Did you no wrong
All that is, ever was, and ever shall be
From chaos to harmony
I'm still here singin' my song

And I. see the last stop upon the line
That last magic carpet ride
The kingdom's all in sight
All it is, ever was, and ever shall be
From chaos to harmony
I'm still here singin' my song

Dried up roses all turn to stone
Born again, you don't know you've been born
Thinkin' for myself
With my own brain
Dried up roses all turn to stone
Too much poison to ramble on
Thinkin' for myself
With my own brain

Days that may
Days all gone
Days just begun
Days still to come
