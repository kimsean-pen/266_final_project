We are so strange and it makes me feel sane
When you're gone, I feel alone
I bite my lips and taste my hips
Watch your eyes watching my thighs

You're the man, you're the man
You're the man for me
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man for me
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man for me
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man

You're the man, you're the man
You're the man for me
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man for me
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man for me
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man

You're so strange and it makes me feel sane
When you're gone, I feel alone
I bite my lips and taste my hips
Watch your eyes watching my thighs

You're the man, you're the man
You're the man for me
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man for me
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man for me
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man

You're the man, you're the man
You're the man for me
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man for me
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man for me
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man
