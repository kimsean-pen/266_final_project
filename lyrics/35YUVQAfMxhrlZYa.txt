I need a mirror
In the eyes of a man
I need no protection
From my bulletproof plan

And I've got a ticket
For all that I lack
You might think that I'm gone for good
But I know that I'm coming back

Sit at my table
Sip from my bowl
Feel like I know you now
And I will do until I get old

You might not see me
But trust that I'll stay
But there's no sense in traveling
If we've already been that way

Night is a matter
Hidden in grass
Bite like a light depends on the ways
To see how long it lasts

But you know better
You stand your ground
It might just stain a little
But she knows you're sticking around

The beauty of uncertainty
The beauty of uncertainty
The beauty of uncertainty
(Beauty of uncertainty)
The beauty of uncertainty
(Beauty of uncertainty)

The beauty of uncertainty
(Beauty of uncertainty)
The beauty of uncertainty
(Beauty of uncertainty)
The beauty of uncertainty
(Beauty of uncertainty)
Beauty of uncertainty
