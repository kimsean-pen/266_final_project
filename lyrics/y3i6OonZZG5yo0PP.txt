Lovely little lady, you've got me on the run.
You're a love machine and you say that I'm your gun.
But I don't care, cause I've got to know...
You said you were a loser, the kind that came up rusted.
So I had to try hard to satisfy your thirst.
But I don't care, cause I've got to know...
The only time she's happy is when the bullets fly.
and she'll make you feel you're better than any other guy.
But I don't care, cause I've got to know...
Lovely little lady, you've got me on the run.
You're a love machine and I'm trying to be your gun.
