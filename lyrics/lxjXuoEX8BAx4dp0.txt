It's the time when I spend all my hours in fear
Emptiness just comes and goes
Hopefully it doesn't show
Cause it's calling my name
Deep inside of my brain
They don't stop
Cause they're trying to drive me insane
Don't know why you went away
Ooh the memories will never fade
December once again
December once again
December once again
Like the stars in the sky
I can still see your eyes
It's the same old pattern
That never dies
I can't seem to leave behind
This emptiness inside my mind
There's a mist in the air
And the feeling is there
Keeps me dreaming of you
It just isn't fair
I don't know why you went away
Ooh the memories will never fade
December once again (Again!)December once again (Ooh!)December once again
Memories will never fade
Why'd you have to go away? All the times we used to share
Why'd you have to go away? To send for me is hard to get
Why'd you have to go away? (Away!)Memories will never fade
Why'd you have to go away? (And go away!)Now the time of the year is finally here
It's the time when I spend all my hours in fear
I don't know why you went away
The memories will never fade
December once again
The memories will never fade
December once again
Why'd you have to go away? (Go away!)December once again
Why'd you have to go away
December once again
Why'd you have to go away (Away!)December once again
Why'd you have to go away (Away!)December once again
All the times we used to share
December once again
Memories will never fade
December once again
