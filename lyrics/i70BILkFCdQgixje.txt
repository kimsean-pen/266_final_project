Sylvia's mother says Sylvia is busy
Too busy to come to the phone
Sylvia's mother says Sylvia is tryin'
To start a new life of her own
Sylvia's mother says Sylvia is happy
So why don't you leave her alone?
And the operator says forty cents more
For the next three minutes

Please, Mrs. Avery, I just gotta talk to her
I'll only keep her awhile
Please, Mrs. Avery, I just want to tell her goodbye

Sylvia's mother says Sylvia is packin'
She's gonna be leavin' today
Sylvia's mother says Sylvia is marryin'
A fella down Galveston way
Sylvia's mother says please don't say nothin'
To make her start cryin' and stay
And the operator says forty cents more
For the next three minutes

Please, Mrs. Avery, I just gotta talk to her
I'll only keep her awhile
Please, Mrs. Avery, I just want to tell her goodbye

Sylvia's mother says Sylvia is hurryin'
She's catching the nine o'clock train
Sylvia's mother says take your umbrella
'Cause, Sylvie, it's startin' to rain
And Sylvia's mother says thank you for callin'
And, sir, won't you call back again?
And the operator says forty cents more
For the next three minutes

Please, Mrs. Avery, I just gotta talk to her
I'll only keep her awhile
Please, Mrs. Avery, I just wanna tell her goodbye
Tell her goodbye
Please, tell her goodbye
