My heart is weak
Tear it down piece by piece
Leave me to think
Deep in my structure
I think I still love her
But I need some sleep
You've taken my breath away
Now I want to breathe
Cause I cannot see what you can see
So easily

Leave me in peace
Caught in my memories
Lost underneath
Deep in my structure
I feel a rupture
From where she should be
You've taken my breath from me
Now I want to breathe
Cause I cannot see what you can see
So easily

I thought my demons were almost defeated
But you took their side
And you pull them to freedom
They know my secrets and won't let me go
Won't let me go

I thought my demons were almost defeated
But you took their side
And you pull them to freedom
I kept your secrets and I thought that
You would do the same
Take me away
Take me away
I thought my demons were almost defeated
But you took their side
And you pull them to freedom
They know my secrets and won't let me go
Won't let me go
Take me away
I thought my demons were almost defeated
But you took their side
And you pull them to freedom
I kept your secrets and I thought that
You would do the same
Take me away
