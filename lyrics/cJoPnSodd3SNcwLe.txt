Back when all my little goals seemed so important
Every pot of gold fill and full of distortion
Heaven was a place still in space not in motion
But soon

I Got You
I got everything
I Got You
I don't need nothing more than you
I got everything
I Got You

We went walking through the hills
Tryin' to pretend that we both know
Maybe if we save up
We can build a little home
But then the hail storm came and yelled
"You need to let go, you've got no control"
No

I Got You
I got everything
I Got You
I don't need nothing more than you
I got everything
I Got You

This weight's too much alone
Some days I can't hold it at all
You take it on for me
When tomorrow's too much
I'll carry it all
I Got You
And when tomorrow's too much
I'll carry it all
I Got You

I Got You
I got everything
I Got You
I don't need nothing more than you
I got everything
I Got You
