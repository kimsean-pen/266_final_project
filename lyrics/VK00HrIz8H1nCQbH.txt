Gravity
Don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me, after you
Run away
Like it was yesterday
And we could run away
If we could run away
Run away from here

I got a bulletproof heart
You got a hollow-point smile
Me and your runaway scars
Got a photograph dream, on the getaway mile

Let's blow a hole in this town
And do our talkin' with a laser beam
Gunnin' out of this place in a bullet's embrace
Then we'll do it again

How can they say
"Jenny, could you come back home?"
'Cause everybody knows you don't
Ever want to come back
Let me be the one to save you

Gravity
Don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me, after you
Run away
Like it was yesterday
And we could run away
If we could run away
Run away from here

I'm shootin' out of this room
Because I sure don't like the company
Stop your preachin' right there
'Cause I really don't care
And I'll do it again

So get me out of my head
'Cause it's gettin' kind of cramped, you know
Comin' ready or not
When the motor gets hot
We can do it again

The papers say
"Johnny, won't you come back home?"
'Cause everybody knows you don't
Want to give yourself up, tell the truth
And God will save you

Gravity
Don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me, after you
Run away
Like it was yesterday
And we could run away
If we could run away
Run away from here

And though I know how much you hate this
Are you goin' to be the one to save us
From the black and hopeless feeling?
Will you mean it when the end comes reeling?
Hold your heart into this darkness
Will it ever be the light to shine you out
Or fail, and leave you stranded?

I'm not goin' to be the one left standing
You aren't goin' to be the one left standing
We aren't goin' to be the ones left standing

Gravity
Don't mean too much to me
Is this our destiny?
This world is after me, after you
Run away
Like it was yesterday
And we could run away
Run away, run away
Run away from here

Yeah
Away from here
Away from here
