You snake
You crawled
Between
My legs
Said "want
It all?
It's yours
You bet
I'll make
You queen
Of everything
No need
For god
No need
For him
Just take
My hand
You'll be
My bride
Just take
That fruit
Put it
Inside"
You snake
You dog
You fake
You liar
I've burned
My hands
I'm in
The fire

Awooooooh... oooooooohhhh

You salty dog
You filthy liar
My heart
It aches
I'm in
The fire
