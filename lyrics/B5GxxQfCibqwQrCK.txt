Blinding darkness surrounds me
and I am reaching for you only
this hopelessness that drowns
all that I believe
will be the one thing that I need
for you only.

there's a hunger it's slowly growing
chasing shadows but never knowing
if all that I have done
is keeping me from you
than can the arms of mercy bring the rescue
to return to you

but I'm so far
but I'm so far
But I'm so far
so far from home
so far from home

keep on running,
farther, faster
and keep on searching
for this haunting has an answer
and I know you will find me in orbit
for I am breathing only for this
for you only
for you only

for you

but I'm so far
But I'm so far
but I'm so far
so far from home

so far from home, yeah
I am so far, so far
so far from home.
so far from home
