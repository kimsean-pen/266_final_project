Find you, keep you
Don't need the air between our lips, no
Hide and seek through
100 "should've walked away"s
To find you, keep you
I'm a double dare away from dropping
Everything to fly out and see you

Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Show me everything I want
Because I want it all

I wanna make my way into your kiss
I wanna live inside your mind
Next to your favorite songs
I won't slow my pace until your walkway
I wanna lose my mood inside a late night phone call with you

Feeling my love mood

I kind of see you
When I climb into my mind
That's where I keep you
And lately where I waste my time

Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Show me everything I want
Because I want you now

I wanna make my way into your kiss
I wanna live inside your mind
Next to your favorite songs
I won't slow my pace until your walkway
I wanna lose my mood inside a late night phone call with you

Feeling my love mood

Yeah, you cloud my
Yeah, you cloud my head
But I can't stay lost forever
Yeah, you cloud my
Yeah, you cloud my head
But can you really get lost in heaven?

Can you really get lost in heaven?

I wanna make my way into your kiss
I wanna live inside your mind
Next to your favorite songs
I won't slow my pace until your walkway
I wanna lose my mood inside a late night phone call with you
