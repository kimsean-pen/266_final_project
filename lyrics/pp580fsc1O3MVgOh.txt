there are gaps between the light
and the dark road we are on
no gaps between what's right
and the need that we have
somewhere under six a.m
there is the room and the event in this room
there is the dark
and these events in the dark
there is love and work and lovers work
love and work and lovers work
love and work and lovers work
love and work
and it took all of my strength
to ignore the need to stay
and it took all of my strength
to leave you either way
and we are constellations in our own way
and there are these
three degrees of merit to us
there is love and work and lovers work
love and work and lovers work
love and work and lovers work
love and work
repeat.
