I overcome this world
Endowed with golden light
Obliterate and recreate

A serenade of life and death
Embraced in eternal night
Infinite and purified

A last gathering of time and space
In solitude, I drawn to stars
Dissolving in eclectic haze
In malice, I saturate in gloom

I overcome this world
Perished in perpetual bliss
Devastate and recreate

A last gathering of time and space
In solitude, I drawn to stars
Dissolving in eclectic haze
In malice, I saturate in gloom

Beyond the veil, blessed initiate descent
In magnitude, splendor bright unscathed

Shattered in pieces, vanquished volition
Mortification of the vulgar sun

I overcome this world
Endowed with golden light
Obliterate and recreate

A last gathering of time and space
In solitude, I drawn to stars
Dissolving in eclectic haze
In malice, I saturate in gloom
In gloom, I saturate in gloom
