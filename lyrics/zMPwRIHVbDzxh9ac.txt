Smacked up and tied
I want so badly to say what's on my stupid mind
I'm running out of sinking sand
I'm giving up control, I'm setting that aside

I don't wanna try to pretend
Like I know what's happening
I'm a stupid fish and so are you
Maybe I'm mad 'cause I see me in you

Me and you
I see myself in you
Me and you

Empty out my empty head
Stop pretending to see
I can't escape my one-dimensional mind
Hairy people trying not to die

I don't wanna try to pretend
Like I know what's happening
I'm a stupid fish and so are you
Maybe I'm mad 'cause I see me in you
I don't wanna try to pretend
I see myself in you and that's why I fucking hate you

Me and you
I see myself in you
Me and you
I see myself in you
Me and you
