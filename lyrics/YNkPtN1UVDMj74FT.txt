Here behind those eyes
There is something you should know
Here behind those eyes
There is something you should know

Change cannot be subject to conditional force
'Cos we're squatting in a system that consistantly stalls
Don't be fooled into thinking that a small group of friends
Cannot change the world

That's the only thing that ever has
The only thing that ever has
Stand Up
Stand Up
That's the only thing that ever has
The only thing that ever has
Stand Up
Stand Up

Here behind those eyes
There is something you should know
Here behind those eyes
There is something you should know

Behind Those Eyes
We Reach Through Their Callous Disguise
Into Fortresses Where they fabricate Whitewash and Lies
We're all Fooled into Living with a Small Pack of Thieves
That Distort the World

That's what this antique structure Creates
What this antique structure Creates
Stand up
Stand up
That's what this antique structure Creates
What this antique structure Creates
Stand up
Stand up

Here behind those eyes
There is something you should know

We are all Connected
We are all Collected here
Now change the world

We blast behind those eyes
Smash through the cortex
Gut wrenching business
Caught off guard
Not psyched for the vortex
This can't be Real!
