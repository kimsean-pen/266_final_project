See them gathered on the plains now
See an army strong and vast
As long as one of us remains here
None of them will ever pass

Here they come so raise the shields high
Like wolves they show their teeth
None of us will ever yield now
To the scavengers beneath
We're outnumbered ten to one here
Still, I love the odds
We will sacrifice them one by one
Send them off to the gods

Soon we will be gone
A free will sacrifice
As free men we are born
And free we shall die

Here they come, ten thousand strong
Charging up the hill
This day will be both hard and long
They move in for the kill

Hold the line, don't let it break
Use your sword and spear
A glory death for all awaits
All who knows no fear
Hordes of men they hit the shields
Like waves to break away
We face our woven destiny
And we don't fear the grave

Soon we will be gone
A free will sacrifice
As free men we are born
And free we shall die
A free will sacrifice
As free men we are born
And free we shall die
