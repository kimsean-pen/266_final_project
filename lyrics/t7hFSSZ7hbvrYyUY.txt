Nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah

I miss you, miss you so bad
I don't forget you, oh it's so sad
I hope you can hear me
I remember it clearly

The day you slipped away
Was the day I found it won't be the same

Nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah

I didn't get around to kiss you
Goodbye on the hand
I wish that I could see you again
I know that I can't
I hope you can hear me
'Cause I remember it clearly

The day you slipped away
Was the day I found it won't be the same

I've had my wake up, won't you wake up
I keep asking why?
And I can't take it, it wasn't fake it
It happened you passed by

Now you're gone, now you're gone
There you go, there you go
Somewhere I can't bring you back

Now you're gone, now you're gone
There you go, there you go
Somehow you're not coming back

The day you slipped away
Was the day I found it won't be the same
The day you slipped away
Was the day I found it won't be the same

Nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah

I miss you
