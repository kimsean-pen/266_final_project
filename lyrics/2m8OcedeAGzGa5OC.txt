Unlike the mole
I'm not in a hole
And I can't see anyway

Just like a doll
I'm one feet tall
But dolls can't see anyway

The frozen stare
The clothes and hair
These make me taste like a man

Tied to a door
Chained to a floor
An hour glass grain of sand

Life in a sack
Is coming back
I'm like the clock
I'm like the clock
I'm like the clock

On the wall
On the wall
On the wall

Swim in the sea
Swim inside me
But you can't swim far away

I never grew
Covered up by you
And nothing grows anyway

Life in a sack is coming back
I'm like the clock
I'm like the clock
I'm like the clock

On the wall
On the wall
On the wall
