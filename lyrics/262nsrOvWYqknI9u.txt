I've been low
I've been down
And I don't want to go there anymore
The sky is wide
Grass is gold
And I can't make my shadow out at all
All day they're gonna tell us
What we can and cannot do
They are gonna feed us to the fire
I can dance
And you can sing
You know that's never going to have a stain again

New blues
Tonight
New blues

Battle cry
And I can barely sleep
It happens every single time
It's in my heart
It's in my soul
For once I don't want to be down
Oh, no one's gonna tells us who we are and will not be
No one's gonna show us to the door
'Cause I've been low
And I've been down
And I don't want to go there anymore
Again

New Blues
Livin'
New Blues
Hey!

Singin'
New blues
Tonight
My true blues

Yes I did
Yes I did
Yes I did

Yes I did
Yes I did
Yes I did

Yes I did
Yes I did
Yes I did
