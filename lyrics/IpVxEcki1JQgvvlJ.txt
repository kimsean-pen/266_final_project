People who believe in heaven
Have really never had a taste
Of the forbidden fruits in paradise
'Cos they've been looking wrong place
There are those who live beside you
Who will comfort you and show you love
Yet the hunger for someone else
Is the only you're thinking of
We all lose our way from time to time
Like a moth to a flame
You're down on tour knees to beg for realese
But sweet desire won't set you free

When you can't get what you want
it makes you want it more
It's the apple tree in Eden
The lustful, inner demon at you core
Sweet desire, it's gonna eat you up
Desire, you'll never get enough
Ruthless, undressed
Sweet desire

You sit and wait for the rapture
To come and wash your sins away
But the sweet desire's gonna catch up
'Cos you sold your soul on judgement day
We all lose our way from time to time
Like a moth to a flame
You're down on tour knees to beg for realese
But sweet desire won't set you free

When you can't get what you want
it makes you want it more
It's the apple tree in Eden
The lustful, inner demon at you core
Sweet desire, it's gonna eat you up
Desire, you'll never get enough
Ruthless, undressed
Sweet desire

'Cos no one is safe when hearts collide
It's a dangerous game
You'll be down on your knees, and there's no realese
When you're infected by the prefect disease

When you can't get what you want
it makes you want it more
It's the apple tree in Eden
The lustful, inner demon at you core
Sweet desire, it's gonna eat you up
Desire, you'll never get enough
Ruthless, undressed
Sweet desire
