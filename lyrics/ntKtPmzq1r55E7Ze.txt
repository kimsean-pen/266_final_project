A pallid sun sheds dimmest glow.
On mute and pallid soil.
I am the one, a life long gone.
A refuge raped in search of life.
Like a shadow on this earth.
In embraces pale as human flesh.
I am unborn, and I'm undone.
How much of me is lost.
I deny my own desire.
Lying one among the liars.
I deny my own desire.
Dark in darkness I can see.
Nothingness is blinding me.
Os abysmi.
I'm drowning in this sea.
For those I loved I hurt.
So you taketh from me.
My name untold and numb.
Where I am there is no thing.
No God, no me, no inbetween.
