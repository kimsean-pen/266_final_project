Am I enough for you?
You are my everything

Am I something?
You are my everything

Am I special?
You are my everything

Am I untouchable?
You are my everything

And maybe I won't feel this way in ten years
But all I know -
is that I want to hold you in my arms tonight

You are enough for me
You are my everything

You are something
You are my everything

You are special
You are my everything

You are untouchable
You are my everything

And maybe I won't feel this way in ten years
But all I know -
is that I want to hold you in my arms tonight

And you must be blind 'cause you don't see the pain in my eyes
And you must be deaf 'cause you don't hear how I cry

And you must be blind 'cause you don't see the pain in my eyes
And you must be deaf 'cause you don't hear how I cry

And maybe I won't feel this way in ten years
But all I know -
is that I want to hold you in my arms tonight

And maybe I won't feel this way in ten years
But all I know -
is that I want to hold you in my arms tonight
