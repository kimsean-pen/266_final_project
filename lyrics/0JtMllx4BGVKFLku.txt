When I wake up in the morning time
I like to see you sleeping by my side
I think about the nights we had before
Wanna give you this and more, let you know I truly adore you

Being with you, loving you this way is so sweet
Way you kiss me, you're making my knees go weak
We could be forever happy through rain or whatever
Never gonna take the fantasy away from you

I need to be everything you see in your dreams
It seems to me you never find another lover
'Cause I still give you all that you need
And I'll be there to love you each and every night
And all through the day, day, day, day

There was a time I didn't have you around
Back in them days my heart never made a sound
Now it's been like my head's in the clouds, never doubt
And I'm a always be down, I hang around you

You're making me feel so good inside
Way I feel when you're loving me makes me wanna cry
All the straightforward things you do
Make my love dream come true
Moving me to tell you that I love you

I need to be everything you see in your dreams
It seems to me you never find another lover
'Cause I still give you all that you need
And I'll be there to love you each and every night
And all through the day, day, day
Day, day, day, day

And I'll be there to love you each and every night
And all through the day, day
I'll be there to love you each and every night
And all through the day, day, day, day

I'll be there to love you each and every night
And all through the day, day
I'll be there to love you each and every night
And all through the day, day, day, day

I'll be there to love you each and every night
And all through the day, day
I'll be there to love you each and every night
And all through the day, day, day, day
