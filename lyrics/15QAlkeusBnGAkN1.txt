Isn't it obvious
When my sheets are tangled up on the bedroom floor
It's not that I'm bothered by
My kitchen sink can't hold much more

Sleepless lonesome nights
Haunted by due time

Hope is dying for now
Haven't you heard?
Atlas folds at the thought
Of what he's just learned

A chain letter trap with one weak link
Maybe we should talk before I speak
Borrowed thoughts from a bitter end
Blame is ours and mine to

Bend it by the fault
Pompeii set us up

Hope is dying for now
Haven't you heard?
Atlas folds at the thought
Of what he's just learned
...
Hope is dying for now
Haven't you heard?
Atlas wants a way out
Before it's gets worse

Haven't you heard?
Haven't you heard?
