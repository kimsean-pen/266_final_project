Maybe, just maybe
I miss you
I miss you, girl

Maybe, just maybe
I need you
I need you here

Sundays on Mondays
I'll see you and calm you

'Till that guy with the money
With no heart
You still love him, why?

Drowning in the river
Where my heart was once a quiver
To the cupid in San Pedro
By the high cliffs near your lover's building

Drowning in the river
Where my heart was once a quiver
To the cupid in San Pedro
By the high cliffs near your lover's building

Lost in dimensions
With no one to guide me

From the utopia to Europa
To Europe, back to your place, dear

I'm at your front door
But I'm dead
Can't knock now, dear

Will you still open?
To say bye
I miss you, Mel

Drowning in the river
Where my heart was once a quiver
To the cupid in San Pedro
By the high cliffs near your lover's building

Drowning in the river
Where my heart was once a quiver
To the cupid in San Pedro
By the high cliffs near your lover's building
