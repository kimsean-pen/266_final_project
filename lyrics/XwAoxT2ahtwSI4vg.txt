How can you get me wrong when I'm so easy?
You'll run me out like time
Still I'm hoping you won't mind if I go
I just don't know if I am doing better
Or for worse, or for worse, or for worse

I'm going backwards, I'll be making happy, oh
Trouble always follows me

Give me your heart now
Lower my guard, now that
That I, that I, that I'm giving in
Now that it's midnight
I'm never hearing back, ah

Can I be on my own when I'm not needed?
So paranoid that I might end up like you
I'm over this low
Nothing to show when things are getting better
Or for worse, or for worse, or worse

I'm going backwards, I'll be making happy, oh
Trouble always follows me

Give me your heart now
Lower my guard, now that
That I, that I, that I'm giving in
Now that it's midnight
I'm never hearing back, ah

Trouble always follows me around
Trying to compete, trying to compete
Trying to compete with me
Twenty-something in fancy red now
And I, and I, and I'm giving in

You are mistaken again
Am I having a mental breakdown?

Give me your heart now
Lower my guard, now that
That I, that I, that I'm giving in
Now that it's midnight
I'm never hearing back, ah

Give me your heart
Give me your heart now
Now that it's midnight
Give me your heart tonight
(That I, that I, that I'm giving in)
