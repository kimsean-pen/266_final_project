I'm going up

It's 'bout as bad as it could be
Seems everybody's buggin' me
Like nothing wants to go my way yeah
It just ain't been my day
Nothin's coming easily

Even my skin is actin' weird
I wish that I could grow a beard
Then I could cover up my spots
Not play connect the dots
I just wanna disappear

Up, up, up
Can only go up from here
Up, up, up
Up where the clouds gonna clear
Up, up, up
Theres no way but up from here

Even something as simple as
Forgettin' to fill up on gas
There ain't no explanation why
Things like that can make you cry
Just gotta learn to have a laugh

Up, up, up
Can only go up from here
Up, up, up
Up where the clouds gonna clear
Up, up, up
Theres no way but up from here

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When everything is goin' wrong
Don't worry it won't last for long
Yeah it's all gonna come around
Don't let it get you down
You gotta keep holdin' on

It's 'bout as bad as it could be
Seems everybody's buggin' me
Like nothin' wants to go my way
It just ain't been my day
Nothin's comin' easily

Up, up, up
Can only go up from here
Up, up, up
Up where the clouds gonna clear
Up, up, up
Theres no way but up from here

Up, up, up, up oh
I'm going up I'm going up I'm going up
I'm going up I'm going up I'm going up
I'm going up I'm going up oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
