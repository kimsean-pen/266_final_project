Engulfed by fate
Knowing you're part of, foretold prophecy
Awaiting the future
Post-apocalyptic visions you see them
Nearing tsunami
Cleansing the world of all inhabitants
Dormant volcanoes
Rapidly awakened, spewing out torment

Impending,
Calamities come forth
Anxious from
Prospects of affliction, bllissful
Revelations, religion, clairvoyance, self assured
Proactive, actions to be taken, bring about

Armageddon the end that nears
Without warning to the nonbelievers
Trying to facilitate
Precursor anarchy proliferation
The credulous populace
Ready to partake, extensive indiscretion

Cynics that are only interested
In disruption
Join festivities
Tearing down the entire system
They believe
Will be no more
Acting out final impulse,
Boundless juncture
Looming devestation
Awaiting the ultimate release
Of death
Relish the undertaking

Enlisting anyone who will wreck
Cconfiguration
Of the status quo
Feeding paranoia to the rest
Of what's next
Riots the beginning
Constructing revolution,
Loosely bound
The chaotic notion
Preach to leave caution to the wind,
No more sin
End of days is here

Living in the frenzy so surreal
Ignoring possible extinction
Preparation after thought

Conspiracy consume many of them
What they new when and how
Goverment coverup primary beef
Not uninhibited extermination
Staring down the end of a barrel
Not fazed by threat oblivious
Still exasperated no warning given
Observing aristocracy full disregard

Living in the frenzy so surreal
Ignoring possible extinction
Preparation after thought

Peasants following their trendy causes
Forgetting the grand scheme of things
If predictions of events prove true
So many left to fend off annihilation

Ignoring mass extinction

Cracks in the earth seperate, devestation
Ash covered sky, enveloping darkness
Spreading fire burns everything unrestrained
Inhospitable indefinite wasteland
Methane lakes emerge poisonous
Asphyxiation

Mass extinction
