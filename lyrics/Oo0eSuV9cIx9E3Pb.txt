I don't want to take and baby I don't want to break and baby
I don't want to try and make you anyway
I just want to lie down, tell my crazy brains to lie down
And then fall away

I won't be alone I won't be waiting by the phone
I won't be dreaming of you dreaming of me anyway
Tell me where you've been and I will tell you where I've been
It will be all ok

I don't have a home it's not a chain it's not a throne
It's just a picture of a picture tossed and torn away
Of anger on your face still not as strange and not as brave
As when you turned away

I won't be the one when all is said and all is done
I won't be breathing like you breathe into the light of day
I'll be in the yard still taking pictures in the dark
Of all our torn up praise

Leave me not alone I won't be chased I won't be thrown
I won't be bleeding for you bleeding for me everyday
Tell me where you've been and I will tell you where I've been
It will be all ok
