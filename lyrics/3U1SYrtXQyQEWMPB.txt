Well I've been following stones I've thrown
I cannot seem to leave those days alone
I've felt the fire
I've burned my bridges again
It was down by the deadwood
Down where the dirt track
Bends

(ohh, ohh, ohh)
(ohh, ohh, ohh)

I'm coming out of black hill
Swam the green ridge lake
It's harder now its over
Harder to take
I've felt the fire
I've burned my bridges again
It was down by the deadwood
Down where the dirt track
Bends

(ohh, ohh, ohh)
(ohh, ohh, ohh)
(ohh, ohh, ohh)
(ohh, ohh, ohh)

That old dirt road
It turned to gold
It turned to gold
That old dirt road
It turned to gold
It turned to gold
