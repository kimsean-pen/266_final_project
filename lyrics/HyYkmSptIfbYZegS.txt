You sheltered me from harm
You kept me warm, you kept me warm
You gave my life to me,
You set me free, you set me free
The finest years I ever knew
Were all the years I had with you

I would give anything I own,
Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own,
Just to have you back again

You taught me how to love,
What its of, what its of
You never said too much
But still you showed the way
And I knew from watching you,
Nobody else could ever know
The part of me that can't let go

I would give everything I own,
Give up me life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again

Is there someone you know,
Loving them so,
Yut taking them all for granted.
You may lose them one day,
Someone takes them away,
And they don't hear the words you long to say

Ev-ry-thing I own...{Reapeat about 2 X's}

I would give anything I own,
Everything I own, Nobidy can love love love like I do

I would give everything I own,
Give up me life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again

I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again
Just to have you, back again...
