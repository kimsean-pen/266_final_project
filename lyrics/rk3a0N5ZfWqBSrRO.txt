[Shannon]
I don't ever wanna leave your arms when your holdin' me I'm so caught up in the moment baby

[Dawn]
Whatever you tell me I believe you right away when I play I like they way you spend with you I wish I could

[Chorus]
Press pause on like
Since there's no way to rewind
Really wish we had more time
Fast forward through hard times
Press pause on like
Really wanna feel like you're all mine
Everything is fine when you're here

[Aubrey]
Every problem, every issue
Doesn't matter when I'm with you
Boy, I'm so into you, my baby (baby)

[D.Woods]
Every time we kiss time just stops
Oh I miss you and I think of days spent with you
I wish I could

[Chorus]
Press pause on like
Since there's no way to rewind
Really wish we had more time
Fast forward through hard times
Press pause on like
Really wanna feel like you're all mine
Everything is fine when you're here

[Bridge]
I'm in love with you
Can't, get enough of you
When you're around me I feel like
Everything's okay
I'm in love with you
Can't, get enough of you
When you're around me I feel like
Everything's okay

[Chorus]
Press pause on like
Since there's no way to rewind
Really wish we had more time
Fast forward through hard times
Press pause on like
Really wanna feel like you're all mine
Everything is fine when you're here

[Lead - Aubrey]
Sometimes I wish
(I wish I could somehow)
I could rewind
(I could rewind the time)
(just wanna be with you baby)
Just wanna be with you baby
(wish I could find a way)
Wish I could find a way
(that I can make you stay)
(really been missin' you baby)
Really been missing you baby
You baby
You baby
I really been missing you baby
You baby
You baby
I really been missing you baby

[Chorus]
Press pause on like
Since there's no way to rewind
Really wish we had more time
Fast forward through hard times
Press pause on like
Really wanna feel like you're all mine
Everything is fine when you're here
