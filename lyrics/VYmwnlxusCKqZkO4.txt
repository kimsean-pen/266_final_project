Girl you know I've waited for this day
I was stuck on a puzzle, I drowned in the pouring rain
You reached out to me, you showed me the way
Your fears, like mine, they took the midnight train
Now so much of me is in your hands
And my burden is yours to hold, as yours is mine
Call for me, my lover
When your nights are gone astray
Every now and then we'll need a savior
Every now and then we'll need a hand
When you feel your bedroom walls are crumbling
Don't you dare to think that you're alone, no
You've been there where light seems far away
Your shadow behind me, but I couldn't see
Reaching out for something we don't know
Holding on to one we still don't have
Call for me, my lover
When your lights are gone astray
Every now and then we'll need a savior
Every now and then we'll need a hand
When you feel your bedroom walls are crumbling
Don't you dare to think that you're alone
I guess we found each other in the dark
Girl you know I've waited for this day
