It's gonna get better, it's gonna work out
Give it a minute, it's gonna turn around
'Cause it's gonna get better, better
It's gonna get better, better

So just coast with me
So just coast, coast
So just coast, coast with me
So just coast, coast
So just coast, coast

Maybe I'm too old to be so hopeful
Maybe I'm too young to be so bitter
But I swallowed adolescence by the chokeful
And came away looking like a quitter

I'm singing
I keep making mistakes
But it takes some time to get anything right
Right?
You know that I keep making mistakes
But it takes some time to get anything right

'Cause it's gonna get better, it's gonna work out
Give it a minute, it's gonna turn around
'Cause it's gonna get better, better
It's gonna get better, better

We're gonna keep living
We're gonna get by
We never have to lay down and die
'Cause it's gonna get better, better
It's gonna get better, better

So just coast with me
So just coast, coast
So just coast, coast with me
So just coast, coast
So just coast

It's funny how trivia nearly broke me
But tragedy seemed to put me back together

I keep making mistakes
But it takes some time to get anything right
Right?
You know that I keep making mistakes
But it takes some time to get anything right
'Cause it's gonna get better, it's gonna work out

Give it a minute, it's gonna turn around
'Cause it's gonna get better, better
It's gonna get better, better
We're gonna keep living

We're gonna get by
We never have to lay down and die
'Cause it's gonna get better, better
It's gonna get better, better
So just coast with me

Life's already been hard enough

Without you giving up on yourself
When you're down at the bottom you know it only gets better
It's gonna get better before it gets worse

We never have to come back to Earth
'Cause it's gonna get better, better
It's gonna get better, better
We're gonna keep living

We're gonna get by
We never have to lay down and die
'Cause it's gonna get better, better
It's gonna get better, better
'Cause it's gonna get better, it's gonna work out
Give it a minute, it's gonna turn around
'Cause it's gonna get better, better
It's gonna get better, better
We're gonna keep living
We're gonna get by
We never have to lay down and die
'Cause it's gonna get better, better
It's gonna get better, better
So just coast with me
