Tonight I'm feeling like an animal
Tonight I'm howling inside
Tonight I'm feeling like an animal
Tonight I'm going wild

And all I want
Is to be with you again
And all I want
Is to hold you like a dog

And all I want
Is to be with you again
With you again
Just to hold you like a dog

Tonight I'm screaming like an animal oh ho
Tonight I'm losing control
Tonight I'm screaming like an animal oh ho
Tonight I'm getting so low

And all I want
Is to be with you again
And all I want
Is to hold you like a dog

All I want
Is to be with you again
With you again
Just to hold you like a dog

That's all I want, that's all I want
Just to hold you like a dog
That's all I want, like a dog
That's all I want, that's all I want

Just to hold you like a dog
That's all I want
Just to hold you like a dog
That's all I want
And all I want
Just to hold you like a dog
And all I want
Just to hold you like a dog aoo
