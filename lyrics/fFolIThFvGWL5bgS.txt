do you wanna dance?
fine. but do you remember when
in your living room
when we made some room & moved ourselves around in it?
it's how my heart resumed.
i got caught/ you got those caravaggio moves
we had some good ideas but we never left that fucking room

do you wanna talk?
fine. i'll talk it out with my dad
it's always nice what he says
he'll have some good advice from something in a book he read
if i did what i wanted then why do i feel so bad?

would you like a drink
while we wait for everything
to get good again?
we're good at things & so are a lot of our friends
we should forget these set backs and get back moving again

i dont know what
i'm afraid of
but i'm afraid
one day it all
will fall away
maybe i read that
but still, let's see
if nothing else it's an idle curiosity

so would you like that drink?
fine, yea i know. i remember that too
in your living room, right?
when we began to fight but then we both got confused
then we were laughing & crying in awe of the size of the moon

do you want to die?
fine you're right
but i wonder what it feels like
to stop feelin so alive
what if we could wake up in five years and things'd be feelin alright?
i wanna visit the future and dance in a field of light!
