The stars begin to fall
Mirrored in your swimming pool
The wind lets out a hopeless sigh
I wish I could fly

The stars begin to fall
Escape plans on your bedroom wall
Through your window an open sky
I wish I could fly

I'll take you to the moon
Where the sun can't shine through
We'll grow silver apples and golden pears
I know I'll see you there

I'll take you to the moon
Where the sun can't shine through
We'll grow silver apples and golden pears
I know I'll see you there
(you there, you there...)
