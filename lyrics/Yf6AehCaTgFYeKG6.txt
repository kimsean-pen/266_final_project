We've got that push, that pull, that friction
We've got that ying, that yang
Juxtaposition
Side by side
I feel like you could ride with me symbolically
Take our broken pieces
Make a symphony, you and me

Playing tetris
Bodies on the mattress
How we fit together, how we fit together
Perfect messes
Damn, all of your edges
How we fit together, how we fit together

We are a walking contradiction
I feel your fingertips in high definition

Learning all of your twists and turns
So carefully
Your anatomy
Take our broken pieces
Make a symphony, yeah, you and me

Playing tetris
Bodies on the mattress
How we fit together, how we fit together
Perfect messes
Damn, all of your edges
How we fit together, how we fit together

Feel the chemistry when your kissing me
There is poetry, in our symmetry
When you move with me, move with me
Feel the chemistry when your kissing me
There is poetry, in our symmetry
When you move with me, move with me
When you move with me, move with me

Playing tetris on the mattress
Playing tetris on the mattress
Playing tetris
Bodies on the mattress
How we fit together, how we fit together
Perfect messes
Damn, all of your edges
How we fit together, how we fit together
How we fit together
