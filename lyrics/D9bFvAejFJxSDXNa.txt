There is a flame untamed
Deep in my heart
Unyielding, pure Ain Soph
'Tis measureless
Our right divine

Aspire to all horizons
To seek nature ov things
Retreat within yourself
To find the primal breath

Slaves ov the dead gods
Martyrs ov the falsehood
Your life is death now
Engulfed by the wake ov a million years
Welcome to Amenti

To perceive means to know
To possess means to deny
In the catacombs of life
Concealed within death's vaults
Pure vibration lies
Nitya-Samsarins
Travel to the house ov empty words
Am-Heh! Devour their hearts!

Slaves ov the dead gods
Martyrs ov the falsehood
Your life is death now
Engulfed by the wake ov a million years
Welcome to Amenti

Jerusalem is falling!
Falling! Falling!
Jerusalem is falling!
Yerushalaim Nehereset!
