I'll stay
I'll stay
For she'll be coming back
You know her head went out to play
She'll get over that
I know that my reward
When she returns
Woo-woo!
Keeps me hanging on
I'll stay
I'll stay
Though friends they ridicule
You know for her there is no substitute
Talk I can endure (I must endure)
But that's alright, mother says "Son"
Know my reward
When she returns (whoo-whoo)
She'll still come home, whoaah
Keeps me hanging on

I'll stay

Ba ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba doo-whoo whoo-whoo
Ba ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba doo-whoo whoo-whoo
Ba ba-ba-ba

Ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba doo-whoo whoo-whoo
