Many, many years ago, when Persia came ashore
Heeding Leonidas' call, the Spartans went to war

Joined by their brothers, a few against the fateful horde
Hellenic hearts are set aflame,
The hot gate calls their name

A final stand, stop the Persians, spear in hand
Form a wall, live to fall, and live Forever

Sparta! Hellas!
Then, and again, sing of three hundred men!
Slaughter! Persians!
Glory and death, Spartans will never surrender!

Morning has broken, today they're fighting in the shade
When arrows blocked the sun, they fell,
Tonight they dine in Hell

By traitor's hand, secret passage to their Land
Know his name, know his shame will last forever

Sparta! Hellas!
Then, and again, sing of three hundred men!
Slaughter! Persians!
Glory and death, Spartans will never surrender!

Sparta! Hellas!
Then, and again, sing of three hundred men!
Slaughter! Persians!
Glory and death, Spartans will never surrender!
