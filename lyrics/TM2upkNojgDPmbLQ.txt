I'm a person just like you
But I've got better things to do
Than sit around and fuck my head
Hang out with the living dead
Snort white shit up my nose
Pass out at the shows
I don't even think about speed
That's just something I don't need

I've got the Straight Edge!

I'm a person just like you
But I've got better things to do
Than sit around and smoke dope
'Cause I know that I can cope
Laugh at the thought at eating ludes
Laugh at the the thought of sniffing glue
Always gonna keep in touch
Never gonna use a crutch

I've got the Straight Edge!
I've got the Straight Edge!
I've got the Straight Edge!
I've got the Straight Edge!
