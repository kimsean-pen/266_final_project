The clock chimes in an empty room
I can feel you moving away
Come out to the garden where the lilacs bloom
There is something that I need to say

I can draw your face from my memory
To the story behind every line-ine
I can beg you to stay, but that's not the way
That I'm never gonna make you mine

So is it just enough to know you love me, baby?
Is it not enough to know I care about you?
Is it strong enough a bond to carry on?
Or is there something else that's really true?

Why do I feel like I'm losing you?
Why do I feel like I'm losing you? Ooh ooh
Why do I feel like I'm losing you?
Is it 'cause there's something else that's really true?

Why do I feel like I'm losing you?
Why do I feel like I'm losing you? Ooh ooh
Why do I feel like I'm losing you?
Is it 'cause there's something else that's really true?

You remember that night that I stayed out late?
Woke you up at quarter after three
Afraid my face would show the spark that was burning in my heart
So I didn't let you close to me

Had I dream that night that I was walking alone
In a city where no one knew my name
I came upon you in the street and then you said to me
Darling, nothing ever stays the same

So is it just enough to know you love me, baby?
Is it not enough to know I care about you?
Is it strong enough a bond to carry on?
Or is there something else that's really true?

Why do I feel like I'm losing you?
Why do I feel like I'm losing you? Ooh ooh
Why do I feel like I'm losing you?
Is it 'cause there's something else that's really true?

Why do I feel like I'm losing you?
Why do I feel like I'm losing you? Ooh ooh
Why do I feel like I'm losing you?
Is it 'cause there's something else that's really true?
Is it 'cause there's something else that's really true?
Is it 'cause there's someone else?
Is it 'cause there's someone else?
Is it 'cause there's someone?
Is it 'cause there's someone?
