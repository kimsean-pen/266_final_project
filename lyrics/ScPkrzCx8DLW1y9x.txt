How you've been?
Have you told your mother about me?
I heard you've been away to discover yourself or something
But was it worth it when you stole his heart?
Never returned it, but he punching you from the start
Are you working or just wasting your time?
Did I mention that you're still on my mind?
Still that lonely guy
Low yet high
Don't know why I still get at your phone
Like, me, I should fucking focus on my own life
Yeah, but the bigger picture slips in you
Become more significant in the mixture
Can't seem to see myself
Always tried to be myself
But who am I, who am I?
