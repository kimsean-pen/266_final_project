I'm careful with the truths I tell
Wine stained teeth don't really suit me well
But I gave myself 22 days
22 days to come up with a master plan

And all I got
My life is chicken scratch
Sometimes baby
You can't sell the same shit back

Riding on your wave
People can be so plain
With the power to rearrange

I'm easy with the time I fell
Counted backwards straight into hell
But I gave myself 22 days
22 days to come up with a master plan

And all I got
My life is chicken scratch
Sometimes baby
You can't sell the same shit back

Riding on your wave
People can be so plain
With the power to rearrange
