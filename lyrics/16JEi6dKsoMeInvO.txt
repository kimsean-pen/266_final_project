Oh my god, what's going on?
This night got fucking weird
Drove so fast my brain got buzzed
And now I'm standing here
Met so many faces that will probably forget me
Boy I bet I look so grown up, shirt tucked in my jeans
And now after it all I just really wanna call my dad
My dad
I feel so broken, I wanna go home
Now I feel so broken, I wanna go home
We went dancing on the roof
and took some girls uptown
They started fighting with my friend
and I can't find him now
We hit some bars and saw some brawls
and found a house to sleep
forgot my retainer
could you not be mad at me?
'Cause now after it all, I'm just standing here to call my dad
My dad
I feel so broken, I wanna go home
Now I feel so broken, I wanna go home
Now I feel so broken, I wanna go home
Now I feel so broken, I wanna go home
