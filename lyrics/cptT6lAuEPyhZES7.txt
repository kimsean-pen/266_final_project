Through oceans of apocalypse
Choking the light
Dark will becomes disorder

Life's ashes lie smoldering
Caressing the silence
Mercurial sparks become frozen

A global death, an impending infirmity
Energies corrupt within the spreading sphere
The realm, a sector of fear

Cosmic Pandemia

Ingenerate astral plague
Coming to life
Projecting cataclysmic violence

Warning comes but this fate has sealed
Embracing the end
A toxic filled empyrean

Infinite, Omniverse of atrophy
Motionless, the silencing of infinity
The pain and what it now brings

A witness to this dying world

Cosmic Pandemia
Cosmic Pandemia
