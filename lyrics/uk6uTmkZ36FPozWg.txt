Let the cat out of the bag
Didn't think you'd be coming back
Season's greetings on a card
You've been a hallmark from the start
If the gravy tasted great
Why did you pour it all away?
You like to intimidate
Intimidate, intimidate
Intimidate, intimidate

Sliding edgeways out of strained
Border protection, list debates
Bitter look of what's to come
Why can't you be more like your mother was
When she was young
And all your idiot cousins like her more
Than all the other aunties
Yeah, 'cause she was a punk, she was a punk
She was a punk, she was a punk
My mum's still a punk and you're still shit

Have you lost your fucking mind?
Its never to late to be on time
You like to intimidate
Intimidate, intimidate
Fuck up your life, lose all your friends
Fuck up your life, intimidate
(Fuck up your life, intimidate)
Fuck up your life, intimidate
(Lose all your friends)
Fuck up your life, intimidate
Fuck up your life, yeah, you got it)
Intimidate, lose all your friends
(Go on, fuck up your life)
Fuck up your life, fuck up your life
(Lose all your friends, go on)
Fuck up your life
(Alright, yeah, fuck off then)
(Okay, good, fuck off)
