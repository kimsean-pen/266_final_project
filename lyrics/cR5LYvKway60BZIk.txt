Why don't you cry for me Baby?
Help me make it through
Why don't you see me lately?
I'm sad that I'm true

I looked up the page and your portrait it was mine
Knew it was the only
one of its kind
I pulled out my money on the run
Did not mean to hurt any one

But I got to sing it, baby
And tell it for fun
Might as well defend the whole body
I'm in love with someone

Several years of rubies and pearls at her breast
She's a demon, she's a demon, she's a demon lover
Just like all the rest
Or else she's billing out her wings
In the many shades of contentment she brings
I got to hide it baby
Because of you
And I hope that you're proud now honey
It's all I can do

I lit the darkness, darling
Come and build up my mind
And I can see the likeness baby
Your pain had to find

Is it any mystery how we come to fall
In and out of love when sympathy's so small?
And I never meaning for some tears to come
Still you leave your silken flings all undone

Why don't you call me sugar?
Like you used to do
I know you kisses are pure poison
I'm a-counting on you

And I know that you heads half crazy
And I'm walk crawling too
And lets make some hoops up Daisy
I'm a-counting on you
