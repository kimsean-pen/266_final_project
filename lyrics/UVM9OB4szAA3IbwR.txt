Greyhound Bound for Nowhere
Rain on the window makes me lonely
And time keeps on passing so slowly
The old man sitting next to me is falling asleep
On a Greyhound bound for nowhere

The sun's going down on my misery
Another day gone by with broken dreams
That telephone I hear ringing, I keep wishing it was you
On a Greyhound bound for nowhere

That ring that you were wearing, don't mean everything
And the way that you stood staring, as you watched me roll away
She loves you and you need me, but there's some things we can't share
I'm on a Greyhound bound for nowhere

And I'm gonna find some place I can ease my mind
And try to heal my wounded pride

Rain on the window and I'm still lonely
And time keeps on passing so slowly
You're with her and I'm alone, and you're wishing I was there
I'm on a Greyhound bound for nowhere
We're all on a Greyhound bound for nowhere
