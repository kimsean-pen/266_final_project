Hey you,
This is for you all,
You've given me the sense to be
Thank you thank you,
This is my chance,
No heart,
Nobody,
No Class
Believe me,
When I say,
Success will cost integrity
Disarming,
Repeating,
Seduce you with mediocrity.

Hey you hey you,
Let's hear you scream,
I'll spoon feed you my imagery
I need you I need you,
To spit it out,
I'll be what everyone talks about
Believe me,
You've saved me,
The effort of being myself
Compel me,
Subdue me,
This time we,
Won't be going back.

I want to hear you scream,
Spit it out,
Scream,
Spit it out,
Scream,
Spit it out

I want to hear you scream,
Spit it out,
Scream,
Spit it out,
Scream,
Spit it out

Why don't you spit it out?
Why don't you spit it out?
Why don't you spit it out?
Don't hold it in,
Spit it out.

I want to hear you scream,
Spit it out,
Scream,
Spit it out,
Scream,
Spit it out
