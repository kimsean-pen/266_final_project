Well we had a lot of luck on Venus
We always had a ball on Mars
We meeting all the groovey people
We've rocked the Milky Way so far
We danced around with Borealice
We're space truckin' round the the stars

Come on, come on, come on
Let's go space truckin'
Come on, come on, come on
Space truckin'

Remember when we did the moonshot
And pony trekker led the way
We'd move to the canaveral moonstop
And everynaut would dance and sway
We got music in our Solar System
We're space truckin' round the stars

Come on, come on, come on
Let's go space truckin'
Come on, come on, come on
Space truckin'

The fireball that we rode was movin'
But now we've got a new machine
'Yeah yeah yeah yeah' the freaks said
Man those cats can really swing
They got music in their Solar System
They've rocked around the Milky Way
They dance around the Borealice
They're space truckin' everyday

Come on, come on, come on
Let's go space truckin'
Come on, come on, come on
Space truckin'

Come on, come on, come on
Let's go space truckin'
Come on, come on, come on
Space truckin'

Yeah yeah yeah space truckin'
Yeah yeah yeah space truckin'
Yeah yeah yeah space truckin'
Yeah yeah yeah
