Gonna stay in bed today
'Cause I can't stand the light
Don't know why I get so down (down, down, down)
I won't be much fun tonight
And I can't believe you still want to hang around (around) me

It's not so pretty all the time
You don't mind, to you it's alright

As I am is how you take me
Never try to push or make me different
When I talk you listen to me
As I am is how you want me and
I know I've found the piece that's missing
I'm looking at him (him, him, him)

I'm not the girl you think you see
But maybe that's a lie
You almost know me better than
Me, myself and I
Don't know a lot of things
But I know what I got

It's not so perfect everyday
I don't have to try
'Cause it all falls into place (it all falls into place)

As I am is how you take me
Never try to push or make me different
When I talk you listen to me
As I am is how you want me and
I know I've found the piece that's missing
I'm looking at him

Face to face, eye to eye
You're standing there (there)
Feels good on the inside
I don't mind, I don't care (care)
You're standing there (there)
Seeing me for the first time
Seeing me for the first time
Seeing me for the first time

As I am is how you take me
Never try to push or make me different
When I talk you listen to me
As I am is how you want me and
I know I've found the piece that's missing (found the piece that's missing)
I'm looking at him

Found the piece that's missing
Take me as I am
When I talk you listen
Take me as I am (I am)
Found the piece that's missing
Take me as I am
