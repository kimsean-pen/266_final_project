Shelling out what you need
there's no time for self-esteem
take your carbon pill tonight
have a seat for the fight
way too late to come off smart
leave your mask inside its box
smile cold anatomy
teeth like stars you start to freeze

you can't wake up
never wake up
can't wake up
seems to me like there's really no reason

impossible day
I don't complain
I'm over it I guess
scattered and grey so
I hold it back
and keep it sugarless

you just caved in yeah
it came from nowhere
you just caved in
it came from nowhere
