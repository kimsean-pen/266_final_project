Slow
I'm gonna settle down slow
Down to the hum of
Electric life and soul

Faith
In my hand to trade
But for the word and
The light of a bitter scent

And you can get me work
But I can't work for free
I've got a room downtown
With a bed and a big TV

If you can raise a star
From garbage on the street
Then you can make a modern life
For a modern girl to lead

Alone
I feel alone
When I'm living in a building
Like a tooth in heaven's throat

True
It's a beautiful view
But you know they're gonna set it on fire
When they feel like something new

And you can get me work
But I can't work for free
I've got a room downtown
With a bed and a big TV

If you can raise a star
From garbage on the street
Then you can make a modern life
For a modern girl to lead

But why can't anything be real?
Emotion like the movies feel?
A pill to break the drone of reverie
So bring me to the hand of fate
The river or the new arcade
So I can wash the empty hours away

But why can't anything be real?
Emotion like the movies feel

So bring me to the hand of fate
The river or a new arcade

And you can get me work
But I can't work for free
I've got a room downtown
With a bed and a big TV

If you can raise a star
From garbage on the street
Then you can make a modern life
For a modern girl to lead

Cause I'm living in a room downtown
With a bed and a big TV
