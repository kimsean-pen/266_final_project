Betty always knows
Betty always tells
She's laughing desperately

She said it felt like a river inside her bones
When she went down to the well

I'm gonna be with her
She's gonna take me there
Lead me by my hand

Her body a rocking chair for my soul
When we go down to the well

I can hardly wait, baby
I can hardly wait
'Til we go down to the well

Been thinking to myself
And if a love ain't long
What matter does it make

If there'll be favorite songs playing in my head
When we go down to the well

I can hardly wait, Betty
I can hardly wait
'Til we go down to the well
Down to the well
Down to the well
