Sometimes this house feels like a prison
That I just can't leave behind
There's so many rules I got to follow
'Cause you can't let go

I don't wanna hear it
And I j-j-just can't believe it
All the stupid things you say

But one day
I won't take this anymore
One day
I'll be old enough to do to do to do what I want to
I won't have to run away
And you won't be there to say I'm not allowed to
One day

Sometimes I wonder if you know me
Or if you just pretend to care
T-Tell me are you on a mission to bring me down?

I don't wanna hear it
And I j-j-just can't believe it
All the stupid things you say

But one day
I won't take this anymore
One day
I'll be old enough to do to do to do what I want to
I won't have to run away
And you won't be there to say I'm not allowed to
One day

Go away
Don't look at me
'Cause we're not the same
And you can't do nothing
You can say
That it's not ok
But I'm not afraid
And you can't do nothing

One day
I won't take this anymore
I'll be old enough to do to do to do what I want to
I won't have to run away
And you won't be there to say I'm not allowed to
One day
One day
