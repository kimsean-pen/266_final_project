You go missing when you get bored
You never like to be ignored
Up and down like a see-saw
What are you fighting for
Chain reaction what you expect
I can't give into sin
I'm the cure for your heavy heart
Don't play this heart, gives me in

We don't see, we don't see
we don't see eye to eye
We don't see, we don't see
we don't see eye to eye

Shoot me down like I should make a sound
like there's nothing to it, nothing to it
But you lose your place when I wouldn't play your games
Tell me nothing's different, nothing's different now

I'm so tired of??? days
you say it's my saving grace
Back and forth takes so much time
weakness you'll search and find
Yeah you got so much on your plate
but let's get this straight: gives me in

We don't see, we don't see
we don't see eye to eye
We don't see, we don't see
we don't see eye to eye

Shoot me down like I should make a sound
like there's nothing to it, nothing to it
But you lose your place when I wouldn't play your games
Come on nothing's different, nothing's different now
Make it in the dark lying yeah I know your card
tell me nothing's different, nothing's different
You're right next to my side but we don't see eye to eye
tell me nothing's different, nothing's different now

We don't see, we don't see
we don't see eye to eye
