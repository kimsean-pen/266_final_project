I am a ghost, this is a dream
Theres something here, it calls to me
I sense it cause its always there
So silent as I stare and stare
There is a light, when we're asleep
We bury doors, with locks and keys
With feelings of our hopes and fears
As sounds explode within our ears

Like stars at night falling fast asleep on the risen sun
Wait patiently, you can feel it 'cause its always there
Bright stronger as you stare and stare
Like love and lies shake violently
down to the core to foster grief
It has a way to keep me down
I gotta say it wears me out

So sadly, soul survivors
Lost and lonely in open water
Yay oh, yay oh, yay oh yaaay- aaay oh

Help I'm losing, help I'm falling
Life is silent, the earth is calling
Every reason, every nighttime
And every day starts and ends in sunlight
But I'm not okay with vicious cycle
Somethings broken, it seems unnatural
These shapes are wondrous, but loosely woven
The sounds are deafening, and time is frozen
[Yo oh oh oh (x8)]

So sadly, soul survivors
Lost and lonely in open water
Yay oh, yay oh, yay oh yaaay- aaay oh (x2)
