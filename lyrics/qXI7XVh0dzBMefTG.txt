I never minded love
I knew you were grounded
True to the life that you knew
In time I grew long long
I sank down to rest, the more I do
The more I don't
I never wanted your life
You needed so you were mine

I never wanted love
I never minded
Bleng and your silence is poor
You saw the way I was
And I knew you and counted
All days I was alone
In time I grew long long long
I sank down to rest, the more I do
The more I don't
I never wanted your life
You needed so you were mine
I never let you be mine
All I want to be in you mind
And I knew you and counted
All the days I was alone
In time I grew long long
I fell down to rest, the more I do
The more I don't
I never wanted your life
You needed so you were mine
I never let you be mine
All I want to be in you mind
You will always be in your mind
You
