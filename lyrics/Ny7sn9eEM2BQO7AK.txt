Sometimes I dont know where
This dirty road is taking me
Sometimes I cant even see the reason why
I guess I keep a-gamblin
Lots of booze and lots of ramblin
Its easier than just waitin around to die

One time, friends, I had a ma
I even had a pa
He beat her with a belt once cause she cried
She told him to take care of me
Headed down to tennessee
Its easier than just waitin around to die

I came of age and I found a girl
In a tuscaloosa bar
She cleaned me out and hit in on the sly
I tried to kill the pain, bought some wine
And hopped a train
Seemed easier than just waitin around to die

A friend said he knew
Where some easy money was
We robbed a man, and brother did we fly
The posse caught up with me
And drug me back to muskogee
Its two long years Ive been waitin around to die

Now Im out of prison
I got me a friend at last
He dont drink or steal or cheat or lie
His names codine
Hes the nicest thing Ive seen
Together were gonna wait around and die
Together were gonna wait around and die
