Take me out today, but tell me the way
To tell my friends that I'll be home another day
Take me all the way, throw my
path astray
But make it so I don't grow another day

Say I'm not leaving
Say I'm just finding my way home

Give me inspiration for my lack of attention
And I will try make my time feel
like tension

Give me a connection to this weird convention
And I will try to make my time something to mention

Say I'm not leaving
Say I'm just finding my way home
Say what you mean
Come on stray outside, stray outside with me.
