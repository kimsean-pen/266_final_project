Nobody needs you, not like I do
The moon and the stars are both jealous of you

And I don't wanna be without your love
Could offer me the world but it ain't enough
Can't spend another day without your touch
Don't punish me tomorrow if the world gets rough

Don't punish my love
Don't punish my love
Don't punish my love

Don't punish my- (uh)
Don't punish my love
Don't punish my
Don't punish my love

And I don't wanna be without your love
Could offer me the world but it ain't enough
Can't spend another day without your touch
Don't punish me tomorrow if the world gets rough

Don't punish my love
Don't punish my love
Don't punish my
