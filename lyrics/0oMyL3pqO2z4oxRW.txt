Ohh, feel it coming back again
Ohh, old enough to light the day

Away, something feels right
Been a long time
Calling now
Young boy, painted all white
Colors come in when the rain is out

They'll show you
Ten millions ways of faith
My omen is coming back today
To help me

Feel it coming back again
Old enough to light the day

Away, I can see light
Black skies until the day begins
Same face not the same mind
Every second feel a change within

They'll show you
Ten million ways to doubt
My omen love's coming back around
To help me

Feel it coming back again
Old enough to light the day
