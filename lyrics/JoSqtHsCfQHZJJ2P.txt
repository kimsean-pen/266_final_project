I am here but to give you my best
Stand by your side while you rest
'Cause you're my girl
'Cause you're my girl

I will provide for you best
I've always liked you the best
Fly as you might
Fly as you might

I will support you through this
I'll hold your hand while you rest
'Cause you're my girl
'Cause you're my girl

I think my deeds will attest
I've always liked you the best
Fly as you might
Fly as you might

(Fly as you might...)
(Fly as you might...)
(Fly as you might...)
(Fly as you might...)
(Fly as you might...)
