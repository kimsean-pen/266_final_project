You never alter, you're always you
Everything's breaking, but I don't care
Smash the rest up, burn it down
Put us in the corner 'cause we're into ideas

Take these edges, they're inside out
No one will notice, they're looking elsewhere
We can be honest, we call it off
We've got the choice if it all goes wrong

We walk
We walk
We walk
We wa-alk

You see the changes in things that come
It's how you deal with it when switching off
Make a decision, a precondition
We've got the choice if it all goes wrong

Where nothing makes you feel good... We've got the choice if it all goes wrong

We walk
We walk (if it all goes wrong)
We walk
We wa-alk (if it all goes wrong)

We walk
We walk (it makes you feel good, it makes you feel god)
We walk
We wa-alk (when it all goes wrong)

We walk
We walk
We walk
We wa-alk
