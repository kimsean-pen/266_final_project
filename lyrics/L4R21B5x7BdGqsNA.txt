Roll away your stone, I'll roll away mine
Together we can see what we will find
Don't leave me alone at this time
For I'm afraid of what I will discover inside

'Cause you told me that I wouldn't find a hole
Within the fragile substance of my soul
And I have filled this void with things unreal
And all the while my character it steals

Darkness is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I see

It seems that all my bridges have been burned
But you say, "That's exactly how this grace thing works"
It's not the long walk home that will change this heart
But the welcome I receive with every start

Darkness is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I see
Darkness is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I see

Stars hide your fires, these here are my desires
And I won't give them up to you this time around
And so I'll be found with my stake stuck in this ground
Marking the territory of this newly impassioned soul

Hide your fires, these here are my desires
And I won't give them up to you this time around
And so I'll be found with my stake stuck in this ground
Marking the territory of this newly impassioned soul
And you, you've gone too far this time
You have neither reason nor rhyme
With which to take this soul
That is so rightfully mine
