We are...
I've come apart and you made me
Float like a pretty box of your evil
So tired, so easy I...
Bleed out, what the fuck were you thinking?
We are...
Gonna fall if you lead us
No where, no wasted time

I'll be a thorn in your side 'til you die
I'll be a thorn in your side for always
If we sink, we left our love

I'll be a thorn in your side 'til you die
I'll be a thorn in your side for always
If we sink, we left our love

We are...
Let me stop for a second
Held heart...
Only beats in the evening
Low tide...
Watching for flight

I tell you to cut it out but you made me
You know why, the slowest spark is a breather
How high, how will you decide?

I'll be a thorn in your side 'til you die
I'll be a thorn in your side for always
If we sink, we left our love

I'll be a thorn in your side 'til you die
I'll be a thorn in your side for always
If we sink, we left our love

So low, you keep stalling
Could you not see why?
(Say, say, say) Love was...
(Say, say, say) That you see cry
(Say, say, say) A simple call seems right (Say, say, say)
And I know why (Say, say, say)

I'll be a thorn in your side 'til you die (Say, say, say)
I'll be a thorn in your side for always
If we sink, we left our love (Say, say, say)

I'll be a thorn in your side 'til you die (Say, say, say)
I'll be a thorn in your side for always
If we sink, we left our love (Say, say, say)
Say, say, say
Say, say, say
