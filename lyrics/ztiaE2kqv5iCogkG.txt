I shiver when you touch my skin
And I know without asking
You're right there where you wanna be
You're right here in front of me

And you talk about travelling
Where we'll go and where we've been
But this thing you're building now,
All I see is it coming down

You are so good
I know that this is gonna hurt
I don't think we should
You know it's never gonna work
There's things that you can't see
You're way too close to me
This ones gonna hurt

When you feel cold in the summer sun
Leaves fall and the winter comes
Why does it take us by surprise
It's been the story of our lives
The more you know, the less you learn
What goes unsaid, doesn't go unheard
If only I could help us both
Can't run away from where we're going

You are so good
I know that this is gonna hurt
I don't think we should
You know it's never gonna work
There's things that you can't see
You're way too close to me
This ones gonna hurt

You are so good
I know that this is gonna hurt
I don't think we should
I know it's never gonna work

You are so good
I know that this is gonna hurt
I don't think we should
You know it's never gonna work
There's things that you can't see
You're way too close to me
This ones gonna hurt

This ones gonna hurt
