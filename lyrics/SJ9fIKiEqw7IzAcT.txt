Are you gonna hurt
Are you gonna burn
Gonna answer me?
Let me take your heart
Love you in the dark,
No one has to see
I, I want more, I want more
I, I want more, I want more

Ooh, you see yourself in another way
I try my best but I don't ever change
Ooh, I love to watch your body lie
Makes me feel better
Makes me satisfied
Oh oh oh, you could bring it back
Who wouldn't want it when he looks like that?
Oh oh oh, I want you to stay
And if I try my hardest
Would you look my way?

Are you gonna hurt
Are you gonna burn
Gonna answer me?
Let me take your heart
Love you in the dark
No one has to see
I, I want more, I want more
I, I want more, I want more

(I wanna lift this curse)
(I don't wanna feel worse)

Oh oh oh, you could bring it back
Who wouldn't want it when he looks like that?
Oh oh oh, I want you to stay
And if I try my hardest, would you look my way?

Ooh, are you gonna hurt
Are you gonna burn
Gonna answer me?
Let me take your heart
Love you in the dark
No one has to see
I, I want more, I want more
I, I want more, I want more
