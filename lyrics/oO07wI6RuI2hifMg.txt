You've got my attention, there's no need
To hurt yourself this way
You think no one will notice how you're feeling
When you cry yourself to sleep

You feel stuck on the outside looking inside
Wishing this life wasn't your life
And you think you're damaged way beyond repair
Well, you're not so far that I can't get to where you are

You wish you were someone else
Every night you fall to pieces
Knowing you can't save yourself
I can see you, I can hear you

There's a place where the broken go
There's a room full of second chances
You're not stranded on your own
You're not invisible

I'm ready to listen, there's no need
To hold it all inside
The smallest whisper, I hear it
When your strength has all but died

I need you to believe me, can you trust me
That what you see is not what I see?
The reflection in the mirror's telling lies
'Cause nothing you have done can change how much I love you

You wish you were someone else
Every night you fall to pieces
Knowing you can't save yourself
I can see you, I can hear you

There's a place where the broken go
There's a room full of second chances
You're not stranded on your own
You're not invisible

I can see you
As you're falling on your knees
You're not invisible to me
You're not invisible

You wish you were someone else
Every night you fall to pieces
Knowing you can't save yourself
I can see you, I can hear you
There's a place where the broken go
There's a room full of second chances
You're not stranded on your own
You're not, you're not
You're not stranded on your own
You're not invisible
You're not invisible to me
You're not invisible to me
