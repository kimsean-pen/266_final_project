A handful of golden dust
Is what determines me
Magic inside of us
Speaks astronomy
Sent signals amplified
Through tidal debris
Supernova my guide
Release your energy!

This space foam is so delicious
Dark matter is so divine
Tell me, why are you so suspicious
When you see black holes in my eyes?
In my eyes?

Let this binary be blessed
By holy X-ray
Singularity's our nest
Peace-forming clay
If there is Lord out there
He is just a guest
Sitting in his spaceship
Observing the parade

This space foam is so delicious
Dark matter is so divine
Tell me, why are you so suspicious
When you see black holes in my eyes?

Don't discontinue this expedition
When stuck upon event horizon of my eyes!

Come and join me in my rotation
We won't be held by no bars
Our reunion was tagged the "celestial"
The very moment stars got us baptized
Stars

Wave your hand from parallel universe
Hidden in a folded palm
After twenty eight light-years
My research must be ended somehow
