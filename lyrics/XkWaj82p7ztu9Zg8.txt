I am the anti-psychotic,
I've tried a range of hypnotics.
I am the perfect advert for living impaired.
I'm trapped in a world inside,
Nowhere to run or to hide.
I've tried the leading brands.
But I don't get nowhere.

But a psychotic episode.
And I can't go out today,
Baby's had a psychotic episode
and I'm not feeling good.

Psychotic episode, doctor
How long will I stay,
baby's had a psychotic episode
and I'm not feeling good.

I went to see my doctor.
Felt like a helicopter.
He told me "Shogun, I think the symptoms will get worse"
I took the pills like he said.
No longer tried to use my head.
I'm feeling all the pain in the universe.

In a psychotic episode.
I don't wanna play baby.
and a psychotic episode.
and I'm not feeling good.

Psychotic episode.
How long will I stay,
Baby's in a psychotic episode
and I'm not feeling good.
