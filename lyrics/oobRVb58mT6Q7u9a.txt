Deep in quick sand
You dive in the shallow end
You break your neck and
You? re never ever gonna get up again

The glass house that you lived in
Is deep in the quickening
Angels might call by
But fools they rush in

Bring some peace to your mind
For today is a new day

Here in my hand
Time is just sand
Fine lines of love and hate
There on your face

But I look at this way
In the next seven days
In the next, in the next
It might just change

How can I write the story that
Went and wrote itself down on paperback?
Called the fountain of know thyself
It? s a lonely book still upon the shelf

It? ll be all smiles and we? ll rise and ride
On the waves of a sinking feeling

Bring some peace to your mind
For today is a new day

Happy people don? t give into
Happy people don? t give into
That sinking feeling

It? ll be all smiles and we? ll rise and we? ll sail
It? ll be all smiles and we? ll rise and we? ll sail
On the waves

It? ll be all smiles and we? ll rise and we? ll sail
On the waves of a sinking feeling
