This is making me crazy
These black clouds following me
So I look for signs of light, but rarely I see them

I return to my shelter and I crawl in a bottle
I'm losing my will for this, so over-emotional
Black clouds, they rain down, but they can't kill the sun

Confession of depression, this life I'm second guessing
Like ashes to ashes, I always seem to fall down
I'm tired of running, it's time to face my demons
Confession of depression, this life I'm second guessing

My emotions are storming
And tears fall just like rain
Pain strikes like lightning, despair is becoming my friend

I return to my shelter and I crawl in a bottle
I'm losing my will for this, so over-emotional
Black clouds, they rain down, but they can't kill the sun
The Sun

Confession of depression, this life I'm second guessing
Like ashes to ashes, I always seem to fall down
I'm tired of running, it's time to face my demons
Confession of depression, this life I'm second guessing

Black clouds, they rain down, but they can't kill the sun...
Inside

Still looking for signs of life
These black clouds keep following me!

I return to my shelter and I crawl in a bottle
Black clouds, they rain down, but they can't kill the sun

Confession of depression, this life I'm second guessing
Like ashes to ashes, I always seem to fall down
I'm pushing myself to a point of self destruction
Confession of depression, this life I'm second guessing
I'm tired of running, it's time to face my demons
Confession of depression, this life I'm second guessing

Black clouds, they rain down, but they can't kill the sun...
Inside.
