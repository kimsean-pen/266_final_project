song by Zola Blood

Hold the day down for a while
Watch the sun grow, the bird smile
You already know, been running from the start
Just to find this
I'll travel slow and go headlights
Our eyes cold, it's the sky calls
And heavy tunes, let them as come
And break me into parts of song

Home, home,
Home before the pieces of the day begin to fall
Home, home,
Home towards the light as it rises overboard

Hold the day down for a while
Watch the sun grow, the bird smile
You already know, been running from the start
Just to find this
Through the old fort then I go on
I'm so down as the weather calms
A passing shell sends ripples through my heart
A stone thrown into the dark

Watch the traffic flow
Breathe in, let it go
Watch the traffic flow
To streams that I wanna go
Watch the traffic flow

Home, home,
Home before the pieces of the day begin to fall
Home, home,
Home towards the light as it rises overboard
