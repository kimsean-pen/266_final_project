Go

So here we go again
Another time but it feels the same
Got sick of waiting here
Set sail on the concrete waves
No survivors left to save
Too late for the walking dead

We'll make it on our own
Breathing our own air
'Cause no one else will care and no one really knows
Need more room to shout
Time is running out
But even through your doubts
We will still be here (we will still be here)

Seeing all I see and I still kill, still kill the old way
I'm gonna die before I fall
Don't try to save me

Moving on to a different place
People hide but I see the face
The one that's full of hate
Their apathies not infecting us
Maybe they ride on a different bus
Realize that we'll never change

We'll make it on our own
Breathing our own air
'Cause no one else will care and no one really knows
Need more room to shout
Time is running out
But even through your doubts
We will still be here (we will still be here)

Seeing all I see and I still kill, still kill the old way
I'm gonna die before I fall
Don't try to save me

Last time I fall
This is the last time I'll fall

Seeing all I see and I still kill, still kill the old way
I'm gonna die before I fall
No more saving

Seeing all I see and I still kill, still kill the old way
I'm gonna die before I fall
Don't try to save me
