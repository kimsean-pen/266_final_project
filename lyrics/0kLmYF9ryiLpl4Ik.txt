Show up in your lace
drink up little girl
and they will always let you down
hold your mother's pearl

Show up in your lace
up to your cheekbones
prevention is the only cure
kiss them through windows
throw up in your plate
look angelical
if you sleep before I arrive
I'll pray for you my girl
a flower on fire
and i will always let you down
