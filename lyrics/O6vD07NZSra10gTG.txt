Cold hand surrounds me
I feel the walls around me closing in
And my chest is getting tighter
Cold winds are blowing on
What you left hanging in the air
And your words are getting louder

She said
Sorry but you're never gonna dance again
But my feet just keeps me moving
Trying to break the chain
And I feel like running, and I feel no pain
I feel like running
When I'm lost within my frame

Sharp tongues cut the air
And melt into rain
When it falls on my hand
Is it 'cause I'm gettin' wiser
Far from the ski slope
I feel the earth come running over me

And I feel a little lighter

She said
Sorry but you're never gonna dance again
But my feet just keeps me moving
Trying to break the chain
And I feel like running, and I feel no pain
I feel like running
When I'm lost within my frame

She said
Sorry but you're never gonna dance again
But my feet just keeps me moving
Trying to break the chain
And I feel like running, and I feel no pain
I feel like running
When I'm lost within my frame
