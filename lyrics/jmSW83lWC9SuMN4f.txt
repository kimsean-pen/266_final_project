This is not how you planned it
Not the life you had in mind
Winding days have spiraled into years
And the past is long resigned

Serenade the shade and shadow
Cry a tune for days gone by
Scream a song for all you lost along the way
And the one you left behind

After all the words unspoken
After all the deeds undone
In the dark, where certainties are few
And your song is still unsung

Celebrate the hour of madness
Ride the wave that turns the tide
Dream a song for all you lost along the way
And the one you'll never find

Is it too late for a new day?
Is it too late to cross the line?
Is it too late for a new way
Shine down the light?

Shine down the light
The future will unfold
(Table turning face the burn of reality)
Ride out your chance
The story still untold
(Twisting tension face the burn of mortality)
This is your life
The darkest place you'll go
(Table turning face the burn of eternity)
This is your chance
The choice is yours alone
(Sail away to points unknown)

All you have lived
All you have won
All you have learned
All you have loved
All yours to face
All yours to show
All yours to feel
All yours to know

All you have lived
All you have won
All you have learned
All you have loved
All yours to face
All yours to show
All yours to feel
All yours to know

All you have lived
All you have won
All you have learned
All you have loved
All yours to face
All yours to show
All yours to feel
All yours to know

Celebrate the hour of madness
Ride the wave that turns the tide
Dream a song for all you lost along the way
And the one you'll never find

Is it too late for a new day?
Is it too late to cross the line?
Is it too late for a new way
Shine down the light?
