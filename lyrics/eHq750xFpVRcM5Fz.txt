There was something in the fallout
Ain't it funny how the wind blows
We give them something to talk about
And they're locking up their windows
And even when the night hits
All of the light have got us running
We ain't got to be reckless
But you'll never stop coming

All our friends are watching us
How did it become so serious
Something in the air is dangerous
Everybody here is watching us

We're just bodies, we're just bodies in the night
Move your bodies, move your bodies in the light
Trust nobody, trust nobody in the fight
We're just bodies, we are bodies in the night

Bodies in the night
We are bodies in the night

Telling us to let go
Saying the uprising ain't right
But this is for us, what do they know
And we could do it all night

All our friends are watching us
How did it become so serious
Something in the air is dangerous
Everybody here is watching us

We're just bodies, we're just bodies in the night
Move your bodies, move your bodies in the light
Trust nobody, trust nobody in the fight
We're just bodies, we are bodies in the night

We are bodies in the night
Bodies in the night
We are bodies in the night

All our friends are watching us
How did it become so serious
Something in the air is dangerous
Everybody here is watching us
All our friends are watching us (watching us)
How did it become so serious (serious)
Something in the air is dangerous (dangerous)
Everybody here is watching us

We're just bodies, we're just bodies in the night
Move your bodies, move your bodies in the light
Trust nobody, trust nobody in the fight
We're just bodies, we are bodies in the night

We are bodies in the night
We are bodies in the night
Bodies in the night

We are bodies in the night
