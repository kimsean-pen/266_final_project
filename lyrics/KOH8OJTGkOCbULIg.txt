Busting a pose,
shrug it off the same as when you say something you don't mean
These strings are so dead,
holding off on changing them, until one day they will just break
Sorrow and all

Faces of doubt,
haunted by the memories of everything minus the bad stuff
Sparkling light,
God takes her vengeance on everyone's burned to the ground
Sorrow and all

Don't tell me if you care, come alive with it, let it show
And don't wistfully believe I would die for it
Holding a pose,
why should I put everything into all these songs you just steal
The act in itself,
fills me up in ways that connects me with everyone else
Don't tell me if you care, come alive with it, let it show
Don't wistfully believe I would die for this, what does that make me
What does that make me
What does that make me
