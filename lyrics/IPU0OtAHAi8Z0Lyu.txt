Love is such a pretty thing
But lately is been hard to find
For I can taste it when the wind blows in
And I can see it hiding on the mountain side

But I never thought it could be this bad
I lost all the love I had
So Olivia won't you let me in
Yeah I'm in love again

And if I, if I was a wealthy man
Don't you know I would spend all dimes on you
And I held you, lover, in my giving hand
Don't you know I would make it
So all your dreams came true

Cuz I never thought it could be this bad
And I lost all the love I had
So Olivia won't you let me in
Yeah I'm in love again

But how could you be so far away from me
Why did you leave me all alone
What can I do to make you love me too
So I wrote a song for you
But I'm still alone
I'm all alone

Yeah I remember when everything was gold
Yeah I remember cuz doll I was sleeping with you
But if I could do it all again
Don't you know I would never, never ever run around on you

Cuz I never thought it could be this bad
Yeah and I lost all the love I had
So Olivia won't you let me in
Yeah I'm in love again

Oh Olivia, lover won't you be my friend
Yeah I'm in love again
