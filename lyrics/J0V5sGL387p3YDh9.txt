You, you're givin' me life
Givin' me all of you, mmm
Oh it's true
Losin' myself
I found me right next you, oh yeah

You're something different
Instead of breaking my heart, you're picking up all the pieces
The way you're taking my heart
You're making this thing look easy
But when I'm stuck in my head
We stay in bed through the weekend, yeah, oh yeah

Woh oh I never knew love, never knew love, never knew love
Living without you, living without you
Woh oh I, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost
Now that I've found you, now that I've found you

So hold me down
Don't know what I'd do
If I was without you
My holy ground
Prayin' it's all true
Now that I've found you
It's my ritual

(It's my ritual)
(It's my ritual)

So hold me down
Don't know what I'd do
If I was without you
My holy ground
Prayin' it's all true
Now that I've found you
(My ritual)

You
First thing on my mind when I'm waking up is you, oh yeah
When I'm blue
You spin me around the color wheel, yes you do, oh yeah

You're something different
Instead of breaking my heart, you're picking up all the pieces
The way you're taking my heart
You're making this thing look easy
But when I'm stuck in my head
We stay in bed through the weekend, yeah, oh yeah

Woh oh I never knew love, never knew love, never knew love
Living without you, living without you
Woh oh I, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost
Now that I've found you, now that I've found you

So hold me down
Don't know what I'd do
If I was without you
My holy ground
Prayin' it's all true
Now that I've found you
It's my ritual

(It's my ritual)

Never knew love, never knew love, never knew love
Living without you, living without you
Woh oh I, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost
Now that I've found you, now that I've found you
(My ritual)

Say you'll never let me go
Cause I'm lost without my ritual
