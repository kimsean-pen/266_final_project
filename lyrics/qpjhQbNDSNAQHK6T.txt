When you're feeling petty
And overwrought
I'll be there to be your target
You can throw me what you got
I will take it with a smile
You can dole it without shame
But I will never be your problem
I will never be to blame
'Cause you are mad at nothing
You're just wasting time
I'm not bluffing:
You should've been a friend of mine
When you're feeling guilty
And out of steam
When you're looking for forgiveness
You can take it out on me
When your hands are overflowing
With stones you wish to throw
And your eyes drip with excuse, and someone lit your fuse
This is something you should know
You are mad at nothing
You're just wasting time
I'm not bluffing:
You should've been a friend of mine
Right now you're just sour
But that can sweeten with time
But I'm not bluffing:
You should've been a friend of mine
