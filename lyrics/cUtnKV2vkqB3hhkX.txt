I never meant to cause you
Any sorrow
I never meant to cause you
Any pain
I only wanted one time to see
You laughing
I only wanted to see you laughing
In the purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only wanted to see you
Bathing
In the purple rain

I never wanted to be your
Weekend lover
I only wanted to be some kind
Of friend, hey
Baby, I could never steal you
From another
It's such a shame our friendship
Had to end
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain

Purple rain, purple rain

I only wanted to see you
Underneath the purple rain
Honey, I know, I know, I know times are changin'
It's time we all reach out for something new
That means you too
You say you want a leader
But you can't seem to make up
Your mind
And I think you better close it
And let me guide you to
The purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
If you know what I'm singin'
About up here, come on

Raise your hand
Purple rain, purple rain

I only want to see you
Only want to see you in the
Purple rain
