Oh, how I let you fall from under me
I walked away and never looking back
To chase, the remnants of a fleeting dream
That couldn't wait, just wouldn't wait for me

Heartbeat like it never could stop
Tell my vision and my mind wed be giving you up this time, no
Running wild, trying to set myself free
Lost sight of what was standing right in front of me
This time

And all the while the world
It hit me with the speed of sound
And don't you worry girl
I'm always going to be around
And by the last, you're just like Carter and Cash

Now, I walked this line right next to you
With every step, the closer that well get
The card, and a fever that's so pure and true
We'll paint the town, until it all burns down

Heartbeat like it never could stop
Tell my vision and my mind we'd be giving you up this time, no
Running wild, trying to set myself free
Lost sight of what was standing right in front of me
This time

And all the while the world
It hit me with the speed of sound
And don't you worry girl
I'm always going to be around
And by the last, you're just like Carter and Cash

Heartbeat like it never could stop
Tell my vision and my mind we'd be giving you up this time, no I
Running wild, trying to set myself free
Lost sight of what was standing right in front of me
This time

And all the while the world
It hit me with the speed of sound
And don't you worry girl
I'm always going to be around
And by the last, you're just like Carter and Cash

Just like Carter and Cash
You're just like Carter and Cash
You're just like Carter and Cash

You're just like Carter and Cash
