Drama in my life on purpose
Cause I don't need to have purpose

Throw it all away make ends
Fucking up my night to keep friends

You look hella broke in the comments
So I don't need to have comments on how you feel

I did it all for the no
Did it all for the no good reasons

I set it off for the need
Always knew you would change like seasons

Got a Canari yellow roadside
Haters would say
That they can't find me

Too many people on my rider
Take another pill I'm on a height

As a Blimp in the projects
I don't need to be modest in how I feel

I ain't never broke
But if I'm broke
So don't fix me

I don't need a halfway entry
I'm going solo
An I'm moving slowly

All I care is how I feel
Can't wait to be honest in what's real
Did all for the no

Broke it off for the no good reasons
Said it all for the no
Did it all for the need

Did it all for the no
Set it off for the need
Broke it off for the no
Did it all for the need

Did it all for the no
Set it off for the need
