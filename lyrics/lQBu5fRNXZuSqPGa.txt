Moving ever closer to a point of no return
Feeling better, never better, boy you never learn
Kinda over being twisted, caught up and then burnt
Guess I need to show you how I get what I deserve

Not about the times you left and gave your lust away
More about how good it feels to know I'll make you pay
Couldn't stand the thought of us so I guess you're good with her
Hope she fucks you how you like cause i know how good you were

Actually. I remember now, you're a selfish pig
Pussy too good for a guy like you, mans dick ain't all that big
"Fight for me", I said to you, "you'll lose me if you don't"
Slept on this like I knew you would, got another one waiting who won't

Keep watching, I ain't pausin long to think on what you do
I know you're sitting, wondering what I get that isn't you
Trust me, I've got you sussed its peak how cold this feels
Thought love was strong, guess I was wrong, revenge is more than real

S-H, S-S-H-Y (like)
S-H, S-S-H-Y
S-H, S-S-H-Y (there were some people that felt)
S-H, S-S-H-Y (so like when you, some people felt like)

So like when you, some people felt like
And so they felt like
Or when you-the
You know when you got admitted to
I mean, are you ashamed?
Y-you could, you could throw that off and show that lil like

S-H, S-S-H-Y
Don't try
Move for me, don't ask me why
Not about to let this slide
S-H, S-S-H-Y
S-H, S-S-H-Y
S-H, S-S-H-Y
Don't try
Move for me, don't ask me why
Not about to let this slide
S-H, S-S-H-Y
S-H, S-S-H-Y
