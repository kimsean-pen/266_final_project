Yeah I'm looking for you
and I know you'll be found
with the parking lot kids,
with the loneliest crowd
And his heart's on his sleeve

and your hand's on the wheel
trying hard not to say
what you just don't feel -
yeah you just don't feel

Now you're looking away
could you plan an escape
from the places you've known,
where they know your mistakes?

And you wish he would stop
and you wish you weren't steel
should you try to do something
that you just don't feel?

Something's coming,
but nothing ever does
Something's coming
you better say no to love

When everything he says is wrong
and all you want to feel is gone
go on

When everything he does is wrong
and all you want to feel is gone
go on
