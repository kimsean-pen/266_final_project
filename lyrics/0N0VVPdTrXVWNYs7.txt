I've seen you looking through
wide open windows
Everyone knows you can see
more through a window that's closed
Under your gaze
everything's changing
All that you think that you know
is melting like snow on a
pan on the stove and
All that you think that you feel
No moment's vacant
the blanker the space is
the more there is to see
