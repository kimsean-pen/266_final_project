And we wish to be led
Willing to pretend
We were not losing time
Time wasted
Like any other day
We will make the bed
Thinking, it is dead
It is finally dead

The louder I call, the faster it runs
The louder I call, the faster it runs
The quiet is ours, the work has begun
The louder I call, the faster it runs

I search for patterns, [?] that isn't there
You can't have everything, and still you have nothing
So I take them all apart, light up with the [?]
Sometimes it takes a long, long, long time

The louder I call, the faster it runs
The louder I call, the faster it runs
The longer the day, the nearer the sun
The louder I call, the faster it runs

The louder I call, the faster it runs
The louder I call, the faster it runs
The quiet is ours, the work has begun
The louder I call, the faster it runs
