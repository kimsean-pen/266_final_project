Cars, money so what
We just want real love
All that fake shit blow it up
No they can't control us
Out here livin how we want
Smokin weed n' gettin drunk
We don't give a fuck
We just want real love

I only want the good life
Stay rollin w the homies they on my side
Chicks crazy out here yeh it's so wild
Skin tan with a drink that's how it goes down
And money ain't a problem no way
Anything you want it's free everyday
I roll up in the Brenz then I give it away
I really didn't need another ride anyway oh

Cars money so what
We just want real love
All that fake shit blow it up
No/know they can't control us
Out here livin how we want
Smokin weed n gettin drunk
We don't give a fuck
We just want real love

We know what we know
But we accept the fact that we don't know
We look at this world we got much to explore
Come grab my hand there's a place we can go
Cause it's a good life (& it's alright)
No more low nights (we high on tree)
We chase the sunlight (cause it feels nice)
Catching a wave but we don't need a beach
Cause this right here's the time we remeber
This is the beginning of our now & forever
So everyone gather round
We can come together
It's a revolution
They ain't on our level (alright)
Cause it's a good life, & it's alright
It's a good life, & it's alright

Cars money so what

Smokin weed n gettin drunk
We don't give a fuck
We just want real love
