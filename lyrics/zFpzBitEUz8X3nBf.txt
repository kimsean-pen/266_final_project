Gateways Upon Gateways
Gateways Upon Gateways

The ebb and flow of lethean waves
The ebb and flow of lucidity

I dreamt of a sun
A sun over a sea
That knew no land
So many ships upon it
So many dreaming souls

I dreamt of a hall
Suspended in an abyss
And at its end was a mirror
Reflecting Me from afar

The Self that remains yet unknown

I dreamt of a building
With Labyrinthine Halls
All crimson and gold
All ruin and decay

A room
Which housed an invisible spirit
Of infanticide
I heard his call
And it slew me
And it slew me

Gateways Upon Gateways
Gateways Upon Gateways

The ebb and flow of lethean waves
The ebb and flow of lucidity

I dreamt of a sun
A sun over a sea
That knew no land
So many ships upon it
So many dreaming souls

I dreamt of a hall
Suspended in an abyss
And at its end was a mirror
Reflecting Me from afar
