When everything that's moving breaks
Everything just starts to ache
Yeah, you'll never know, you'll never wake
I think that the world is fake
Moving hips, you'll never learn
Just how much you made this hurt
Idiot, you'll never speak
It's why you take the part of me

I had it all, I can't win
It's the only that I need
I'm sinking under my skin
It's the only way I'll win

If I ever let you go
Got no air, I'm gonna choke
Idiot, you'll never try
Sometimes I think the world's a lie
Take a hit, you'll never learn
Just how much you made this hurt
Idiot, you made me rhyme
I think about you all the time

I had it all, I can't win
It's the only that I need
I'm sinking under my skin
It's the only way I'll win

Disconnect my own
(Take my, take my, take my lonely hand)
Disconnect my own
(Take my, take my, take my lonely hand)
Disconnect my own
(Take my, take my, take my lonely hand)
Disconnect my own
(Take my, take my, take my lonely hand)

Oh, it's the only thing I need
You take control
You hurt my skin
It's the only way I win

Take my, take my, take my lonely hand
Take my, take my, take my lonely hand
Take my, take my, take my lonely hand
Take my, take my, take my lonely hand

Disconnect my own
(Take my, take my, take my lonely hand)
Disconnect my own
(Take my, take my, take my lonely hand)
Disconnect my own
(Take my, take my, take my lonely hand)
Disconnect my own
(Take my, take my, take my lonely hand)
Disconnect my own
(Take my, take my, take my lonely hand)
Disconnect my own
(Take my, take my, take my lonely hand)
Take my, take my, take my lonely hand
