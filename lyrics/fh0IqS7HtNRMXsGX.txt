I've been denied all the best ultrasex
I've been denied all the best ultrasex

I - I tried to consume just like a super faggot
I got subdued
How can y'all bring a motherfucker something so good he couldn't say no?
You nailed me hard
I love 'em when they don't give a motherfucking shit
I could've been someone instead of landing flat upon my ass

Dig me now and fuck me later
And sing it to the tune of faggot, faggot, faggot
Take me now and fuck me later
And sing it with that

I've been denied all the best ultra sex
I've been denied all the best ultra sex

I - I could've been a star
It freaks me out when I sound just like my mom
I could've rocked the spot
Instead of being just another faggot like I am
I played that shit straight
Blowin' suckas on the side hopin' I get laid
Now everybody knows
No way in hell I can ever live it down

Dig me now, fuck me later
And sing it to the tune of faggot, faggot, faggot
Now - take me now and fuck me later
And sing it with that

I've been denied all the best ultrasex
I've been denied all the best ultrasex

I could've been someone instead of falling flat upon my ass

Dig me now, fuck me later
And sing it to the tune of faggot, faggot, faggot
Now - take me now and fuck me later
And sing it with that
I've been denied all the best ultra sex
I've been denied all the best ultra sex
Mo - lest
Faggot, faggot, faggot, faggot
Faggot, faggot, faggot, faggot
Faggot, faggot, faggot, faggot
Faggot, faggot, faggot, faggot
