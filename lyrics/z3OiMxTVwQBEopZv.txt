I climbed a mountain
Not knowing that I had
Thought it was just a road from a to b
I took no protection
Not much of anything
Just went as I was
Looking in windows
And playing songs
And knocking on doors
And I was not scared
I just enjoyed the sights
Kept myself to myself

There I was
Sitting on the roof of the world
There I was
There I was
Not knowing how I got there
Or how to leave

Everyone says
I was lucky to have got there
As not many can
But truth be told
I was saved
By the love
Of a good man
Who came and got me
And bought me down
From on
Up there
Id be lying if I didnt say
I missed it now and then
But I have no wish to go back there

There I was
Sitting on the roof of the world
There I was
With all the gods
Not knowing how I got there
Or how to leave

People say
Whats so special about being back here
With everyone so close
But thats the point
I dont want to be different
I just want to fit in

There I was
There I was
Sitting on the roof of the world
There I was
With all the gods
Not knowing how I got there
Or how to leave
