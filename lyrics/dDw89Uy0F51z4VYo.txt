I turned you into a secret
To memorise alone
To justify my behaviour
Define who I've become

Every time I tell my story
I begin with you
And I recall the night when I, when I,
When I broke in two

We were young, we were proud, we were promising
We were hiding our innocence, ooh
We had time, we had love, we had everything
We had everything, ooh
We were young, we were proud, we were promising
We were caught in the heat of it, ooh
We had time, we had love, we had everything
We had everything, ooh

I turned you into a reason
To keep myself tied up
So when I think that I'm crazy
It was you that screwed me up

But I don't wanna let you go, oh
No, I don't wanna let you go

We were young, we were proud, we were promising
We were hiding our innocence, ooh
We had time, we had love, we had everything
We had everything, ooh
We were young, we were proud, we were promising
We were caught in the heat of it, ooh
We had time, we had love, we had everything
We had everything, ooh

I told you I would always try to be brave
(I didn't mean that, I didn't mean that, I didn't mean that, I didn't mean that, I didn't mean that)
You told me you were happy making mistakes
(I didn't mean that, I didn't mean that, I didn't mean that, I didn't mean that, I didn't mean that)
'Til it was too late
'Til it was too late

We were young, we were proud, we were promising
We were hiding our innocence, ooh
We had time, we had love, we had everything
We had everything, ooh
We were young, we were proud, we were promising
We were caught in the heat of it, ooh
We had time, we had love, we had everything
We had everything, ooh
