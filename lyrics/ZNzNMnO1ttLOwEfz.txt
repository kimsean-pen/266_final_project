Ladies and gentlemen of the underclass:
The President of the United States of America... is Dead!

I don't believe in the politics
of chosen fools and hypocrites
Who walk a line that's tread so fine
Is it death or glory you have in mind?
Here we go, again it's mass delusion
And no one knows who leads this revolution now
As tension grows, no way to a conclusion

It's too late, there's no time
(It's too late, there's no time)
All for none, none for 1, 2, 3, 4

March of the dogs
to a beat of disillusion
Sworn under God bringing panic and confusion
The white flag is down
Send in the clowns
The carnival of sins is now about to begin

It may be i'm a pessimist
But I'd say we need an exorcist
The root of all evil standing tall
Under God and above us all

Here we go, again in desperation
All we know is confusion and frustration now
As tension grows, no vision of salvation

It's too late, there's no time
(It's too late, there's no time)
All for none, none for 1, 2, 3, 4

March of the dogs
to a beat of disillusion
Sworn under God bringing panic and confusion
The white flag is down
send in the clowns
The carnival of sins is now about to begin

1, 2, 3, 4

And now the president's dead
Because They blew off his head
No more neck to be red
Guess to heaven he fled
Was it something he said
Because of who's in his bed
By whom will we be lead
From whose hand will we be fed
All the lies by the lying liars
Who said, we'll be fine, it's okay
Hey look mom, no head!
blah blah blah blah
(It's a carnival of sins!)
blah blah blah
(It's about to begin!)
blah blah blah
blah blah blah
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...
(It's OK, alright...)
