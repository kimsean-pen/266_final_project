The moon above is shining bright
Come on, boy, the time is right
Here I am
Take me in your arms and love me, oooh

There's a mist of ecstasy
That's flowing over me
Here I am
Take me in your arms and love me, oh baby

My love is new, my love is sweet
Now's the time that I'll be sweet
Hold me, boy, don't hesitate
I need you now, don't make me wait

You're the one that I adore
Tell me what are you waiting for
Here I am
Take me in your arms and love me, oooh

Boy, I'm hungry for your love
Give me what I'm in need of
Here I am
Take me in your arms and love me, oh baby

Come let's share the joy and splendor
Of this moment warm and tender
Hold me tight, kiss me long
Make this night one sweet song

Love me
Love me
Oooh, sugar

My eager heart is pounding fast
Don't lose the feeling, make it last
Here I am
Take me in your arms and love me, oh baby

Take me higher with the touch
That thrills me darling, oh, so much
Here I am
Take me in your arms and love me, baby, baby

This feeling is strong to hold
Any second now I'll explode
Now's the time, now's the time
Take all of this love of mine

Love me, love me
Love me, love me
Come on and love me

I'll be true to you
Do what you want me to
Take me in your arms
Take me in your arms and love me, oh, baby

I'll be true to you
And do what you want me to
Take me in your arms
Take me in your arms and love me, baby, baby, baby

I'll be true to you
