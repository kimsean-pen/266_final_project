Why am I using words, no more to say without you
Close the door, put out the lights and go

Late in the night, in the night your shadow falls between us
Nevermore, never know
There, memories are sorrow,
When there's no tomorrow

Sleep while the sweet sorrow wakes my daydream;
Sleep while you think of me with
kindness, please remember former days
Sweet the song that once we sang, the silent parting ways
And you know, and you know,
And you know, long ago when first we made our promise -
Empty words, I wonder did you know

The laugh that love could not forgive,
Is gone and tells no more to live,
And we who look in beauty's love;
Must now, through all, look back on before

The tears that I first cried, no more;
Your love has come and gone, no more
And we who look in beauty's love
Must now through all think back on before

Sleep while the sweet sorrow wakes my daydream
Sleep while you think of me with
kindness, please remember former days
And you know, and you know

And you know, when we two parted in tears and silence
past the days, the parting ways

Fare thee well, fare thee well, you
that was once dear to me
Think of me with kindness
Think of me
