Oh, no
Tonight I find it hard to swallow
The bed is made and I feel hollow
My friends suggest that I should take it slow
I took it slow

And I sweat it out, I'm not okay
And I'm shaking on the floor
I lie awake and I count the days
And I wait beside the door

For love
I only want you next to me
Sweet love
How long before you hurt for me, hurt for me?
Do you hurt for me?

Black out
The night before inside of my mouth
Too much, it's what I like to do now
My mind explodes and I can't make it out
I'm falling down

I see your face and blurry shades
And I reach out for your hand
All your ways, I can't explain
But I want to understand

For love
I only want you next to me
Sweet love
How long before you hurt for me, hurt for me?
Do you hurt for me?

Eyes are deep, my mind with hope of your return
Just enough to weigh me down
I can fake my heart and I love to watch it burn
But it knows
You ain't around

For love
I only want you next to me
Sweet love
How long before you hurt for, hurt for me?
Will you hurt for me?
