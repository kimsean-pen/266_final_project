I'm still sitting here
with the only sound of adoring
and I still wonder where
I'll be the day after all

and can you feel
the grass beneath your
it's like a story
which begin long time ago

and it's slowly getting cold
and I turn apart like you
the lights go out the lights go on
the ways they're crossing as long as you go

I'm sailing I'm sailing away x2
the lights go out the lights go on
the ways they're crossing as long as you go

the lights fade
is walking next to me
