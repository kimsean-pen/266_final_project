I'm staring out the world
I'm staring out the streets
I'm staring out the world
Hoping she will teach
Hoping she will tell
All about herself
I'm staring out the world

Indifferent she looks back
There isn't much to see
A wound about to heal
And about to bleed
I still have blood enough to stand
Blood enough to keep
Staring out the world

A bullet dancing in my brain
Could end it any day now
Oh I'll break in that scene
I'll lift it on my own

Without a stop in raining
Without a shift in daylight
It could be any day now
Another witness gone
