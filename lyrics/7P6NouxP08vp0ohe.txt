(Arjen Lucassen:)
Last night I had that dream again
My world was black as night
Plagued by visions of a future world

(Liselotte Hegt:)
Mr. L, did you take your meds?

(Arjen Lucassen:)
I sang about these dreams
Warning man of his demise
Wasted words that no one heard

(Liselotte Hegt:)
Won't you please relax? I'll make your bed

(Arjen Lucassen:)
Today I had that dream again
I roamed among the stars
On the wings of an amazing flight

(Liselotte Hegt:)
Mr. L, do we feel ok?

(Arjen Lucassen:)
To a place beyond our time
Where the sunlight doesn't warm
And colour bleeds into the night

(Liselotte Hegt:)
We may have to increase your dose today

(Arjen Lucassen:) I know the truth is out there
If you want to see
I know the truth is in here
(Liselotte Hegt:) Why should we believe you?
(Arjen Lucassen:) If you want to feel

(Arjen Lucassen:)
Now I have that dream again
I live beneath the waves
In a realm of grace and majesty

(Liselotte Hegt:)
Mr. L, can I ease your mind?

(Arjen Lucassen:)
In the distant shadows loom
Cold machines rise from the deep
In a world once proud and free

(Liselotte Hegt:)
Won't you free your thoughts, let it all unwind

(Arjen Lucassen:)
I hate to have that dream again
They live inside my head
Feeling everything I feel inside

(Liselotte Hegt:)
Mr. L, can you please be still?

(Arjen Lucassen:)
They speak to me in dreams
They can see all I can see
They have always been my guide

(Liselotte Hegt:)
You gotta hush now please, have another pill!

(Arjen Lucassen:) I know the truth is out there
(Liselotte Hegt:) Why should we believe you?
(Arjen Lucassen:) If you want to see
I know the truth is in here
(Liselotte Hegt:) Why should we deceive you?
(Arjen Lucassen:) If you want to feel

(Liselotte Hegt:) We are alone
There's no one there
You don't have to be afraid
(Arjen Lucassen:) Can't you see through this masquerade?
(Liselotte Hegt:) We are alone
(Arjen Lucassen:) We are all clones
(Liselotte Hegt:) There's no one there
(Arjen Lucassen:) I am so scared
(Liselotte Hegt:) You don't have to be afraid

(Arjen Lucassen:)
Last night I had that dream again
My world was black as night
Plagued by visions of a future world

(Liselotte Hegt:)
Mr. L, did you take your meds?

(Arjen Lucassen:)
They speak to me in dreams
They can see all I can see
They have always been my guide

(Liselotte Hegt:)
Won't you please relax? I'll make your bed

(Arjen Lucassen:) I know the truth is out there
(Liselotte Hegt:) Why should we believe you?
(Arjen Lucassen:) If you want to see
(Liselotte Hegt:) Why should we deceive you?
(Arjen Lucassen:) I know the truth is in here
(Liselotte Hegt:) Why should we believe you?
(Arjen Lucassen:) If you want to feel
