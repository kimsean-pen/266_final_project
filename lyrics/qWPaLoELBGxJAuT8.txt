Gold mellow days
When the lights strips the haze
A little distraction from your worries
And ruby was your eyes
Ruby what a nice surprise
If you wanna dream then dream with me

Put down your mind
Light up and shine
Reach out of me and feel it
Gonna make your move and
Act like a fool
Quit holding back and waiting for the ending

My mind was erased
Blame it all on your fate
If you wanna live then live with me
And we we can choose
To make lover or lose
If youre not done dreaming then dream with me

Put down your mind
Light up and shine
Reach out of me and feel it
Gonna make your move and
Act like a fool
Quit holding back and waiting for the ending to begin

Ruby, won't you slow it down? It's happening so fast
Ruby, won't you pull me back? I'm living in the past
Ruby, won't you slow it down? It's happening so fast
Ruby, won't you pull me back? I'm living in the past

Ruby, won't you slow it down? It's happening so fast
Ruby, won't you pull me back? I'm living in the past
I said Ruby, won't you slow it down? It's happening so fast
Ruby, won't you pull me back? I'm living in the past
I said all that you give me while it lasts
