You wear the crucifix,
like an accessory to a murder yoy didn't witness
After-all it's just a cross,
two little lines could never mean something, so extreme
Where have you gone?
If you don't love just go and say it - It isn't wrong
Where have you gone?
If you don't love just go and say it - It isn't wrong
This war is hell, the medic's not doing well I'm that he's falling ill
He moves from trench to trench, chain-smoking cigarettes
and collecting everyone's syrettes
Where have you gone?
If you don't love just go and say it - It isn't wrong
Where have you gone?
If you don't love just go and say it - It isn't wrong
Where will you go? Dancing through a dream
Once mighty temples have crumbled to the sea
Our love is gone it has spoiled on the floor
Your moving on as I stumble though the war
Where have you gone?
If you don't love just go and say it - It isn't wrong
Where have you gone?
If you don't love just go and say it - It isn't wrong
Where have you gone?
If you don't love just go and say it - It isn't wrong
Where have you gone?
If you don't love just go and say it - It isn't wrong
Where have you gone?
If you don't love just go and say it - It isn't wrong
Where have you gone?
If you don't love just go and say it - It isn't wrong
You never loved me and I always knew it all along
