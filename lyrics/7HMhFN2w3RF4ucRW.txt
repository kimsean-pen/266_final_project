Soon a new day will be spawned
Scattered fires glow
Soon first blood will be drawn
And dying ambers glow

They await the suns first rays
Anticipation running high
The Norns are counting numbered days
Hear the war-cry rise

See the Valkyries ride!

They meet upon this hallowed field
Now the end is near
Two armies not about to yield
The smell of death inthe air

This field has served as battle ground
Since the dawn of this world
Through the years a lot of blood
Has been pored into this earth

Warrior's eyes full of purest rage
Steel cutting flesh
Spilling guts, severing heads
Sending men to their death

Ride, ride, ride Valkyries
Ride, ride, ride Valkyries

The screams of dying men
The comfort in their eyes
Here they come, by Oden sent
See the Valkyries ride

Fallen men lie all around
Their dead eyes look to the sky
And as the swordplay rambles on
They see the Valkyries ride
