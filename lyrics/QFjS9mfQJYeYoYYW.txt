I don't know whether I should hate it or should like it
The way you read through me I'd swear you were a psychic
And I tried to not reach for the phone
But something bigger makes me call you
I don't know what to do, I'm into you

Is it gravity, chemistry, physically pullin' me?
What could it be boy?
'Cause I'm so drawn to you
Like a fool
I keep coming back, it's true
I can't stand it
You're like a magnet
You're like a magnet

I don't know whether I should move on or should move in
Maybe a part of me is fine with never knowing
'Cause I try to leave, but that won't work
'Cause being strong just makes it worse so
What should I do? I'm torn in two

Is it gravity, chemistry, physically pullin' me?
What could it be boy?
'Cause I'm so drawn to you
Like a fool
I keep coming back, it's true
I can't stand it
You're like a magnet
You're like a magnet

Oh, come a little closer
'Cause I'm loving you, loving you, loving you
Oh, come a little closer
'Cause I'm missing you, missing you, missing you
Oh, come a little closer
'Cause I'm loving you, loving you, loving you, loving you, you

Is it gravity, chemistry, physically pullin' me?
What could it be boy?
'Cause I'm so drawn to you
Like a fool
I keep coming back, it's true
I can't stand it

God is it gravity, chemistry, physically pullin' me?
What could it be boy?
'Cause I'm so drawn to you
Like a fool
I keep coming back, it's true
I can't stand it
You're like a magnet
You're like a magnet
You're like a magnet
You're like a magnet

I keep coming back
I keep coming back
I keep coming back
You're like a magnet
