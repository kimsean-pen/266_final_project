I don't wanna stand beside you
I don't wanna try and feel the pain you're going through
'til the death you'll see this through.
Cold sweats, hallucinations
I wanna scream to show
The hell I'm going through
The addiction's taken you.
Can you see me through bloodshot eyes? (through bloodshot eyes)
Should I fight for what is right or let it die?
Now I'm choking on force fed lies
Do I fight or let it die?
I will fight, one more fight
Don't break down in front of me.
I will fight, will you fight?
I am not the enemy.
I will try, one last time
Are you listening to me?
I will fight, the last fight
I am not your enemy.
Everyone is sick of caring
No silver lining on the cloud that covers you
Let it pour and soak you through
No hope, just desperation
So sit and wait for death
and pray it takes you soon.
The addiction's taken you.
Can you see me through bloodshot eyes? (through bloodshot eyes)
Should I fight for what is right or let it die?
Now I'm choking on force fed lies
Do I fight or let it die?
I will fight, one more fight
Don't break down in front of me.
I will fight, will you fight?
I am not the enemy.
I will try, one last time
Are you listening to me?
I will fight, the last fight
I am not your enemy.
(GUITAR SOLO)
Can you feel me through bloodshot eyes? (through bloodshot eyes)
Should I fight another night or let it die?
Now I'm choking on every lie.
Do I fight or let it die?
I will fight, one more fight
Don't break down in front of me.
I will fight, will you fight?
I am not the enemy.
I will try, one last time
Are you listening to me?
I will fight, the last fight
I am not your enemy!!!
I am not your... not your enemy!!!
I am not your enemy!!!
