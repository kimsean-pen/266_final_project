I sit on a rock
cannot be touched by struggle & confusion
I reclaim my space inside my structure
look at this point
all is about nothing, everything comes near
the remotest parts of the world

by silence
we can dissolve disruptive vibrations
I have to try
Ga√Øa's alive for good
under my feet the forest
over me the largest
It's roundness I feel
Lifelong misery
How do we get to Avalon?
There is a bridge beyond
indestructible the earth is a temple

I cannot see what is wrong and
All gods are one

I close my eyes
I'm all around, I feel so present
embracing it's vastness I hold
facing the world
I become a part of it
I'm not alone anymore

I embrace the world
