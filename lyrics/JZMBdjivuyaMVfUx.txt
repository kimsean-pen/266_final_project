Sometimes
I wish I was brave
I wish I was stronger
wish I could feel no pain
wish I was young
wish I was shy
I wish I was honest

I wish I was you not I
Cause I feel so mad
I feel so angry
Feel so callused
So lost confused, again
I Feel so cheap
So used unfaithful
Lets start over

Lets start over

Sometimes
I wish I was smart
I wish I made cures for
How people are
I wish I had power

I wish I could lead
I wish I could change the world

For you and me
Cause I feel so mad
I feel so angry
Feel so callused
So lost confused, again
I Feel so cheap

So used unfaithful
Lets start over
Lets start over

Cause I feel so mad
I feel so angry
Feel so callused
So lost confused, again

I Feel so cheap
So used unfaithful
Lets start over
Lets start over

Cause I feel so mad
I feel so angry
Feel so callused
So lost confused, again
I Feel so cheap
So used unfaithful
Lets start over
Lets start over
Lets start over...
