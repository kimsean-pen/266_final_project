Lying alone touching my skin I'm falling under
A girl like me and I can't hold it in, it makes me wonder
Is this for real? It's not what it seems
You're like an angel, I'm running now my feet off the ground, oh

Take me, touch me
Won't you hold me close?

And then we kiss, your love comes alive on my lips
I feel a rush coming over me, over me
And when we touch this moment when everything's still
I close my eyes and then we kiss

The feel of your hand as it touches my hair it makes me tremble
Don't wanna let go of the feelings we share, so baby, go slow
Our hearts beating fast and my body cries yeah, yeah
I want it to last this burning inside, we're getting deeper

Take me, touch me
Won't you hold me close?

And then we kiss, your love comes alive on my lips
I feel a rush coming over me, over me
And when we touch this moment when everything's still
I close my eyes and then we kiss

You're drifting the sun comes up
You're fading you seem so far
I don't know if I'm awake
Open my eyes and then we we we kiss

Take me, touch me
Won't you hold me close?

And then we kiss, your love comes alive on my lips
I feel a rush coming over me, over me
And when we touch this moment when everything's still
I close my eyes and then we kiss

And then we kiss and then we kiss
And when we touch this moment when everything's still
I close my eyes and then we kiss
