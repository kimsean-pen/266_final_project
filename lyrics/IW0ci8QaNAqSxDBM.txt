She cries, children often do
When they're cold, and hungry too

Come closer, look deeply in her eyes
So delicate, quite unlike her smile

Life clinging backwards
In the fall of dread confusion
Still this silence gnaws upon your fingertips
cold yielding breath, for instant isolation
Far more sinister than the price of doubt

Yet you remain

Still you remain

And she says:
Pray for daylight
Pray for morning
Pray for an end to our deception...

Life clinging backwards
In the fall of dread confusion
Still this silence gnaws upon your fingertips

Cold yielding breath, for instant isolation
Far more sinister than the price of doubt

Yet you remain
Still you remain
And she says:
Pray for daylight
Pray for morning
Pray for an end to our deception...
(violin solo)
Pray for daylight
Pray for morning
Pray for an end to our deception...
