Slept the days away
When I was waiting and no one was around
To be interesting
And I tried to find a way
To follow footsteps away from my hometown
I wasn't listening

My heart's beating so you know I'm alive
Don't hold back on your chance to decide

Was it all worth it?
(I'll build the highest bridge
Only to burn it)
Was it all worth it?
(All the love you gave
When I returned it)
Oh I returned it
You know I think about it now and then
I bet you thought that I would start it again

Counting down the days
Until we leave and move on to the next town
I'm in that state of mind
Where I bottle everything inside my head
And stare at the ground
But it's gonna be just fine because

My heart's beating so you know I'm alive
Don't hold back on your chance to decide

Was it all worth it?
(I'll build the highest bridge
Only to burn it)
Was it all worth it?
(All the love you gave
When I returned it)
Oh I returned it
You know I think about it now and then
I bet you thought that I would start it again

I'm not afraid of what I'm worried, worried about
Can't stomach the thought of an endless doubt
I'm not afraid when I've got something left to give
So I want to know

Was it all worth it?
(I'll build the highest bridge
Only to burn it)
Was it all worth it?
(All the love you gave
When I returned it)
Oh I returned it

Was it all worth it?
(I'll build the highest bridge
Only to burn it)
Was it all worth it?
(All the love you gave
When I returned it)
Oh I returned it
You know I think about it now and then
I bet you thought that I would start it again

Start it again
