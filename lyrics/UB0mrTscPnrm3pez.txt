Just a steel-town girl
On a saturday night
Lookin for the fight of her life
In the real time world
No one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy

Lockin rythms to the beat of her heart
Changing moment into light
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
All the while you're stuck between
What's will and what will be

She's a maniac
Maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like
She never danced before
She's a maniac
Maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like
She never danced before

On the ice-filled line of sanity
It's a place most never see
It's a hard-won place of mystery
You can touch it but can't hold it

You work all your life
For that moment in time
It can come or pass you by
It's a push of the world
But there's always a chance
If the hunger stays alive

There's a cold kenetic heat
Struggling, stretching for the beat
Never stopping
With her hair against the wind

It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
All the while you're stuck between
What's will and what will be

She's a maniac
Maniac at your door
And she's dancing like
She never danced before
She's a maniac
Maniac at your door
And she's dancing like
She never danced before
