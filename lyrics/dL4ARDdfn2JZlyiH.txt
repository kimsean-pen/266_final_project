I spy like a keen bean, a blood-red shade's ahead
My eyes spark in the dead phase about diffuse so fast

Just break it down, just break it down
Don't freak out, nowhere to be safe - I'm here, searching for germs
What a waste and what a shame
Don't make me craze, I shut down the door

No other name
I can pick up for what I need, for what I need
No other place
I can set up to be, it could be the last case

Other blame
I just kill you off for what I hate, for what I hate
No matter what happens here
I can only escape with my hive

I cry like a stray cat, a flat shade stands up dead
My spy plane in the dark, it's about to catch a rat

I break it down, I break it down
To dig the faith, nowhere to hide out - I'm here waiting for moon
Let me siege and just breathe
Don't make me craze, I shoot down the shade

No other name
I can dig out for what I see, for what I see
No other blade
I can pick out to thrash, it could be the last one

Other fame
I just kill off for what I hate, for what I hate
No matter what happens here
I just keep my hive safe to save you

I fly like I backflip, my sight is so twisted
I fly like I'm spellbound, my hive in my pocket
I spy like a pale sting, no blood left to spit
My eyes flash like a black light, to shine on your evil scar

Just break it down, just break it down
Don't freak me out, nowhere to be sure - I'm here searching for moon
Let me siege and let me breathe
But make me craze, I shoot down the end
