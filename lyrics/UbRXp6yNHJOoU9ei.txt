The earth-child
Awakening
Returning waves of time
The blood that runs away from here
Unknown to the ones left behind

These thorns are all I can feel
Fragmented shards of a god
I leave a memory
Better left scattered
In another life

Alongside
The harbinger
An ever-present wound
Spills words that flow tomorrow
A message written in blood

::::::

It appeared
As a ghost
A whisper out of time
Can't walk away
From atonement
Was it worth it all
And can we ever find our way back home?
