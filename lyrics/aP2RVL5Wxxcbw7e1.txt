There's a solitary man crying, hold me
It's only because he's lonely
And if the keeper of time runs slowly
He won't be alive for long

If he only had time to tell of all of the things he planned
With a card up his sleeve, what would he achieve?
It means nothing

To the opium dens and the barroom gin
In the Belmont chair, playing violin
The gambler's face cracks into a grin
As he lays down the king of spades

But the dealer just stares
There's something wrong here, he thinks
The gambler is seized and forced to his knees
And shot dead

He only wanted more time
Away from the darkest door
But his luck it gave in as the dawn light crept in
And he lay on the floor

From the Hundred Year War to the Crimea
With a lance and a musket and a Roman spear
To all of the men who have stood with no fear
In the service of the King

Before you met your fate
Be sure you did not forsake
Your lover may not be around anymore

There's a solitary man crying, hold me
It's only because he's lonely
And if the keeper of time runs slowly
He won't be alive for long
