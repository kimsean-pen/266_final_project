into the line, i see it fine
into the line, our hearts entwine
remember when your time again
remember when your time again
standing in the light
always sitting on the line
never on a side
always wanting to be right
standing in the light
i never wanted to be right
now i'm attracted by the light
and blinded by the sight
into the light
into the light
into the light
into the light
into the light, i see it fight
into the light, a new horizon
bleached into white, kept out of sight
bleached into white, kept out of sight
standing in the light
always sitting on the line
never on a side
pushing out the light
standing in the light
i never wanted to be right
now i'm attracted by the light
and blinded by the sight
remember when your time again
remember when your time again
into the line, i see it fine
into the line, our hearts entwine
remember when your time again
remember when your time again
dead ahead in the night
burning in the light
and knowing that it's right
driving in the night
dead ahead in the night
burning in the light
and knowing that it's right
driving in the night
remember when your time again
remember when your time again
into the light
into the light
into the light
into the light
into the light
into the light
into the light
into the light
into the light
into the light
