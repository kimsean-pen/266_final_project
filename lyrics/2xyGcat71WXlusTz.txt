I've been here before, am I losing my mind?
(Look at me, tell me I'm crazy)
We're in danger...
Follow me and you'll see things are not what they seem
(Take my hand, or don't you trust me?)
We are in danger...
(And I'm the one to blame!)

At the edge of man's reason...
There exist designs...
To escape reality
(The tesseract calls to me!)
Cosmic strings shall be mine to pull!

Failure met by failure
Try again! Try again!
(Still she calls to me...)

Can I hold you closer, and drown in your dreams?
I promise fantasies can be more than words
That we have buried alive
The nightmare is real
Still I pray and beg for more
I'm never closing my eyes!
Forever one with the night!

Hush, sweet baby, don't say a word...

I'm ignoring destiny for reasons I can't tell you
(We try to fool our minds)
How long do we wait for salvation?
(Is it a sin to wonder?)
Get off your knees! (Get off your knees!)

Failure met by failure
Try again! Try again!
(She's insane!)

Can I hold you closer, and drown in your dreams?
I promise fantasies can be more than words
That we have buried alive
The nightmare is real
Still I pray and beg for more
I'm never closing my eyes!
Forever one with the night!

(Can you hear me?)
(Can you see me?)
(Can you hear me?)
(Can you see me?)
(Can you hear me?)
(Someone's talking, someone's watching)
(Can you see me?)
(Someone's talking, someone's watching)
(Can you hear me?)
(Someone's talking, someone's watching)
(Can you see me?)
(Someone's talking, someone's watching)

Delusions of grandeur!
Where the hell am I? (Save me from myself!)
'Cause I can no longer (Play this morbid game!)
Just when I thought it was over
(Here we go!)
Galaxies welcome me inside!

I'm insane!

(Oh, the horror!)
Paranoid and deranged! I am a God!
(Oh, the panic!)
Psychotic and ashamed!
(Why!? Why!? Why!?)

(Can you hear me?)
(Can you see me?)

Can I hold you closer, and drown in your dreams?
I promise fantasies can be more than words
That we have buried alive
The nightmare is real
Still I pray and beg for more
I'm never closing my eyes!
Forever one with the night!

I'm never closing my eyes!
Forever one with the night!
I'm never closing my eyes!
Forever one with the night!

(It was a dark and stormy night...)

I've traveled near and far, raced with all the stars
Now alone I'll be, subtle tragedy
If I had one more chance to just explore...
I would take your hand and do it all again
