What's the point? I don't know
Find myself in another fucking hole
Call it fate, oh I know
'Cause there's no shame in the fear of letting go

I know I'm not well, if you couldn't tell
I lost all I had, it puts me through hell

I guess I let myself go
Thought I could cope, but it's all a waste
I let myself go
Losing all hope, it has gone away

In a place far from home
Where I blamed every loss I've ever know
Call it hate, oh I know
It's vacant eyes that left me sinking like a stone

I can't catch my breath and I've got nothing left

I guess I let myself go
Thought I could cope, but it's all a waste
I let myself go
Losing all hope, it has gone away

What's the point of letting go?
Wilt away when it takes control
When my thoughts break through my bones
I'm afraid it's me I've never known

I know I'm not well if you couldn't tell

I guess I let myself go
Thought I could cope, but it's all a waste
I let myself go
Losing all hope, it has gone away

What's the point of letting go?
Wilt away when it takes control
When my thoughts break through my bones
I'm afraid it's me I've never known
