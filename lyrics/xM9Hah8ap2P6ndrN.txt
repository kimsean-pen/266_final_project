Lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely eyes, lonely face
Lonely, lonely in your place, lonely
Lonely, lonely eyes, lonely face
Lonely, lonely in your place

I thought that I knew
All that their was to lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely

Melanie Jane won't feel the pain
Lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely eyes, lonely face
Lonely, lonely in your place

I thought that I knew
All that their was to lonely
Lonely, lonely
Lonely eyes, lonely face
Lonely, lonely in your place

And I still love you
I still love you
Lonely, lonely
