Words like love and happiness
Never seem to stand up baby
When you put them to the test, yeah
You say that you're a poet
That your love's a work of art
But you can't play love by numbers babe
You gotta play it all by heart

Chorus:
Baby, baby. baby, baby
It happens all the time
How you play me, play me, play me
Playing with my mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby
You're making me go crazy
And if you call that love
Then love should be a crime

Honesty
Bites the dust
Every time I hear you saying
Love is never lust, yeah
Did you read it in a book
Did you see it in a magazine
Do you think that I'm some new age fool
Do you think I'm so naive

Chorus

Love, Love, Love, Love lahaaah
Love should be a crime
Love should be a crime
You & me
Suddenly
We got nothing to say
But the words get in the way

Baby baby, baby, baby
It happens all the time
How you play me, play me, play me
Playing with my mind
Baby baby baby baby
You're making me go crazy
And if you call that love
then all it was
Was a pocket full of nothing
But a suicidal gun
If you call that love
Then love should be a crime
