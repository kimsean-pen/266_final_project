Gone away are the golden days
Now just a page in my diary
So here I am a Utopian citizen
I? m still convinced there's no such thing as idealism

Oh, memories they're following me like a shadow now
And I'm dreamin'
? Cause I've already suffered the fever of disbelief, yeah

But I've seen your act, I know all the facts
I'm still in love with who I wish you were, yeah
And it ain't hard to see who you are underneath
But I'm still in love with who I wish you were
I wish you were here, yeah

I was true as the sky is blue
But I couldn't soon say the same for you, no, no
So now I find denial in my eyes
Mesmerized by the, the picture that's in my mind now

Tell me when I'll finally see your shallow heart
For what it is, yeah
'Cause I don't wanna keep on believin' in illusions, no, no, no

'Cause I've seen your act and I know all the facts
I'm still in love with who I wish you were, yeah
And it ain't hard to see who you are underneath
I'm still in love with who I wish you were
I wish you were here

Sometimes I can't explain, and I'm so sorry that I can't
I'll try to concentrate on your true identity

'Cause I've seen your act and I know all the facts
I'm still in love with who I wish you were, yeah
And it ain't hard to see who you are underneath
I'm still in love with who I wish you were

I've seen your act and I know all the facts
I'm still in love with who I wish you were, yeah
And it ain? t hard to see who you are underneath
I'm still in love with who I wish you were
Now I wish you were here

I wish you were here
Wish you were here
I wish you were here, yeah
I wish you were here
