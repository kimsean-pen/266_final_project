my inner demons compel me to be here
your cheeks are flush like rose petals
you're consumed with rage but i'm consumed with you

our eyes intertwine through the haze
intoxicated by your bloodshot stare
in all of my dreams i never thought i'd see
a face that could launch a thousand ships

and the music was like wind in your hair
the moonlight caressed your silhouette
kiss of ocean mist is in the air
why must god punish me this way

lay down my hand the next move is yours
as you undress me with your frozen eyes
in all of my dreams I never thought I'd see
an endless love to share my blue lagoon

and the music was like wind in your hair
the moonlight caressed your silhouette
kiss of ocean mist is in the air
why must god punish me this way

happiness is hard to come by
but I've had my fair share
the satin sheets, the lemon peels
the minor keys, the major pills
we've climbed the mountain, saw the top
and planted the apple seed
and can't you see we could've had it all

and the music was like wind in your hair
the moonlight caressed your silhouette
kiss of ocean mist is in the air
why must God punish me this way

and the music was like wind in your hair
the moonlight caressed your silhouette
kiss of ocean mist is in the air
why must god punish me this way
why must god punish me this way
this way, this way, this way ...
