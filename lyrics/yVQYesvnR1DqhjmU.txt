You gotta problem you just can't hide
Compulsive habits that never seem to die
Your breath is takin' up all the air
Your teeth are rotting to black holes in your head
Well reality is due What you say just can't be true
When the story is stretched and so far fetched
That you're lacking an excuse
You Lied

Your mother allowed you for just one white lie
But now she's dead, and she left you with a problem
Pinocchio has pierced your tongue
Your nose is growin' into the 3rd dimension
Well reality is due What you say just can't be true
When the story is stretched and so far fetched
That you're lacking an excuse
You Lied

Well reality is due What you say just can't be true
When the story is stretched and so far fetched
That you're lacking an excuse
You Lied
