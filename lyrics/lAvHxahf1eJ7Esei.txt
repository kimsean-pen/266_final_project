What strikes fear in the heart of one man
Might not even move another
While a stranger gets your hand
You turn your back upon your brother
And you know, you know, you know, you know

We are on to the highest towers
And the valleys at our feet
We are counting all the hours
'till the life a love will meet
And you know, you know, you know, you know
You know it's gonna take some time

If we want to, we could do what kings do
I could feel the earth move when you speak
If we fight through all the things we want to do
Everything will change for me and you
We could do what kings do

If you are already up a tron
And you have forgotten who you are
We all have the power of angels
We are far from the same star
With a heart of a lion
And the lips of a child
One part of you is dying and one that is running wild
And you know, you know, you know
You know it's gonna take some time

If we want to, we could do what kings do
I could feel the earth move when you speak
If we fight through all the things we want to do
Everything will change for me and you
We could do what kings do
We could do what kings do
We could do what kings do
We could do what kings do

It's gonna take some time
It's gonna take some time

If we want to, we could do what kings do
I could feel the earth move when you speak
If we fight through all the things we want to do
Everything will change for me and you

If we want to, we could do what kings do
I could feel the earth move when you speak
If we fight through all the things we want to do
Everything will change for me and you
We could do what kings do
We could do what kings do
We could do what kings do
We could do what kings do
