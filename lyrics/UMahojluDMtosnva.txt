I was like, "Hi, nice to meet ya"
I could see me in your T-shirt
I could hear love from the speakers
I could see us in front of a preacher
Saying, "I do," in my white dress
Fell so deep, I need a life vest
It don't usually happen like this
Nah nah, nah nah (Whoo)

And I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew
Knew I had to lock it down
Lock it down, lock it down
I said I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew (Hey)
Knew I had to lock it down
Lock it down, lock it down (Uh)

They say that fools rush in
But I, oh I, I wanna be foolish with you
I wanna be foolish with you
They say that fools rush in
But I, oh I (Hey), I wanna be foolish with you
I wanna be foolish with you (Whoo)

This ain't no one night stand
Want yo picture on my nightstand (Hey)
Be my lover, be my best friend
Put that bling bling on my left hand
Saying, "What kinda love you gon' put on me?"
'Cause your last name sounds good on me
What kinda love you gon' put on me?
'Cause your last name sounds good on me

And I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew
Knew I had to lock it down
Lock it down, lock it down

They say that fools rush in
But I (But I) oh I, I wanna be foolish with you (Foolish with you)
I wanna be foolish with you (Say it again, say it)
They say that fools rush in
But I, oh I (Oh I), I wanna be foolish with you (Foolish with you)
I wanna be foolish with you (Come on, say)

They say that fools rush in (They say fools rush in, but I wanna be)
But I, oh I, I wanna be foolish with you (Foolish with you)
