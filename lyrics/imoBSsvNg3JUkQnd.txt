You got new jeans, the hood is not gone
I'm in the new dress that I've never worn
And I could have sworn
You didn't bat an eye when I walked
Into the room and I first thought
You could be the one

Have we been seeing the world through a piece of shattered glass
Something so beautiful can fall apart so fast

Just before goodbye
You had the chance to change your mind
Just before you lied saying
You gave this your best try
It's not enough to try
You have to give your blood and tears and time
You had one last chance to change your mind
Just before goodbye

Curtains are drawn but we're still dressed
The film plays on right under my bed
I ask what is left now
But you ignore, pretend that we're fine
We're not together, half of the time
I would have known the signs

Have we been seeing the world through a piece of shattered glass
Cause something so beautiful can fall apart so fast
Don't you understand

Just before goodbye
You had the chance to change your mind
Just before you lied saying
You gave this your best try
It's not enough to try
You have to give your blood and tears and time
Take the world of hurt inside
You had one last chance to change your mind
Just before goodbye

Just before goodbye
You had the chance to change your mind
Just before you lied saying
You gave this your best try
It's not enough to try
You have to give your blood and tears and time
Take the world of hurt inside
You had one last chance to change your mind
Just before goodbye
Before goodbye
Before goodbye
