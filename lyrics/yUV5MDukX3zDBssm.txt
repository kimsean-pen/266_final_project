No escape from your fate
Destined to be mine
Every night I wait to see
In the dark, watching

Stalking your every move
I know when you're all alone
All alone

Tied tight to the bed
Legs spread open
Bruised flesh, lacerations
Skin stained with blood

I'm the only one you love
I feel her heart beating
My knife deep inside
Her crotch is bleeding

She liked the way it felt inside her
Fucking her harder, harder
She liked the way it felt inside her
Fucking her harder, harder

Stick it in
Rip the skin
Carve and twist
Torn flesh

From behind
I cut her crotch
In her ass
I stuck my cock
killing as I cum
