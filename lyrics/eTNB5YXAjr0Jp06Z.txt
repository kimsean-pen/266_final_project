Stop!

The first one to hit the cop wins
His death was so obvious
Make up the things that you did
I hid in the bushes, I was tripping on thizz
Description, of no sir you can't ignore
The lights they are blinding, and you man are such a bore

Please smash the target
Please smash the target
Please smash the target
Right where the heart sits

Whoever said we had to stop this from happening?
My plans changed abruptly and you chose to flee this unstable setting
And I'll only survive in this life
(I got that necklace, I got that watch
I copped that blow torch, off your front porch)
I'll only survive if it's you by my side
(I got that bottle of jack, I got five on that sack)
and I'll only survive in this life
If this fails then I'll bail you out of jail

It's so obvious you're constantly blocking me from rational thinking

Maybe I look good in leather
In my bed, I pluck your feathers
We should fucking be together
Now look alive and say you've gotta go
Well, don't it feel good? You got what you paid for
Well, don't it feel good? You got what you paid for

Maybe I look good in leather
In my bed, I pluck your feathers
We should fucking be together
Now look alive and say you've gotta go
Well, don't it feel good? You got what you paid for
Well, don't it feel good? You got what you paid for

Brace me honey I need friction
If I slur my words, correct my diction
It's not always fact or fiction
I made the plan, I'll make my own plan
Period, colon, grammar arsenal
I think we need some brand new barstools
A new decor, oh man, that car's cool
I change the plan, I bought my own plan

The night was innocent, but she'll never believe that I was alone
(Reciting words I never meant to write) The night was innocent!

You want a piece of my mind
That's fine, that's fine, that's fine
You want a piece of my mind, that's fine

Just keep your arms around me and I won't let your body touch
I won't let it touch the ground
Just keep your eyes on me and let me be your gravity

Until you can, can sleep sound (You're right, I am addicted)
Until you can, can sleep sound (The point, I guess I missed it)
Until you can, can sleep sound (It's not your fault)
But I'll blame it on anything but myself
Until you can, can sleep sound (You're right, I am addicted)
Until you can, can sleep sound (The point, I guess I missed it)
Until you can (It's not your fault)
