I sent you out to play last night
The alarms went off at three
Funny how I'm not loving now
Lonely does the guarantee
I sent you out to play last night
The alarms went off at three
Funny how I'm not laughing now
He's not coming home to me
I sent you out to play last night
The alarms went off at three
Funny how I'm not laughing now
He's not coming home to me
I try to get out of the place
And I move out of love
If only there was no consequence
I'd watch it all turn to dust
Hey, can I go with you, my beauty*2?
Hey, can I go with you when the rendezvous' over? It's over
Hey, can I go with you when the rendezvous' over?
Hey, can I go with you when the rendezvous' over?
Hey, can I go with you when the rendezvous' over?
Hey, can I go with you when the rendezvous' over?
Hey, can I go with you when the rendezvous' over? It's over
Hey, can I go with you when the rendezvous' over? It's over
Hey, can I go with you, my beauty*2? No, it's not over
