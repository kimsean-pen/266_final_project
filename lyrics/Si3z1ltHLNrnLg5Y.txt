Take one last look at what you're leaving behind
Cause there's no, coming back once we go
We are the children of an innocent crime
and it's time to take down the throne
Although their heads may shake
We'll set the city ablaze, for their treachery
(oh)
We'll spill their blood and set our fathers free
(oh)
Two hundred years of war
Fight 'til we are no more
A curse on the streets of gold, oh, oh
Just know, that mine is a hand to hold
Take back what the kingdom stole
A curse on the streets of gold

Oh,
Two hundred years of war
Fight 'til we are no more
A curse on the streets of gold, oh, oh
Just know, that mine is a hand to hold
Take back what the kingdom stole
A curse on the streets of gold
