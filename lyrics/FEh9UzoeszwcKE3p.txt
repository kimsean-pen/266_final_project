I walk alone like a concrete lion
In the concrete wilderness
Somewhere deep in the concrete jungle
Is a concrete lioness

Looking for love
In every single thing I see
Looking for love
But love ain't looking for me

Surrounded by millions of people
That I hope I never have to meet
Searching for a sweet lady woman
To share a little body heat

Looking for love
Concrete

Carry your egg like a concrete penguin
A concrete Emperor
A concrete man in the concrete tundra
Concrete Antarctica

Looking for love
I'm tired of playing the concrete field
Looking for love
I've got to keep my concrete eyeballs peeled

Surrounded by millions of people
That I hope I never have to meet
Searching for a sweet lady woman
To share a little body heat

Looking for love
Concrete

Surrounded by millions of people
That I hope I never have to meet
Searching for a sweet lady woman
To share a little body heat

Looking for love
Concrete
