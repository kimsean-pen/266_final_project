There is a drum
Beats 'til the end of time
Beats a peculiar rhyme
Keeping watch upon us.
There is a drum
Pounding unceasingly
Bound to eternity
Keeping watch upon us.

Moving across every face of the earth
In the blood and the dirt
Remembering everything.
Wordlessly casting its eye
Like the ghost of a ghost on the land
Remembering everything.

There is a drum
Beats 'til the end of time
Beats a peculiar rhyme
Keeping watch upon us.
There is a drum
Pounding unceasingly
Bound to eternity
Keeping watch upon us.

Moving across every face of the earth
In the blood and the dirt
Remembering everything.
Wordlessly casting its eye
Like the ghost of a ghost on the land
Remembering everything.

When judgment comes
The balance weighed
All deeds accounted, all debts repaid
Then shall we all be found
And from the silence come just one sound...

Moving across every face of the earth
In the blood and the dirt
Remembering everything.
Wordlessly casting its eye
Like the ghost of a ghost on the land
Remembering everything.

When judgment comes
The balance weighed
All deeds accounted, all debts repaid
Then shall we all be found
And from the silence come just one sound...
Sense be made of every life
Of every wrong, of every right
Sense be made 'til kingdom come
Oh my Lord, there is a drum.

There is a drum
Beats 'til the end of time
Beats a peculiar rhyme
Keeping watch upon us
There is a drum
Pounding unceasingly
Bound to eternity
Keeping watch upon us
