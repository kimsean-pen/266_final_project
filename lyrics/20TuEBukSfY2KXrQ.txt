You said "what am I supposed to do?
Because I'm drowning in inches of water with you
And what am I supposed to say?
You know you're the reason I'm acting this way"

And you weren't there when I was in over my head
The room is spinning around again
And I'm working on my ways
Because I haven't been very honest lately

Can you keep me from falling asleep tonight?
You're the only thing making me feel all right
Skyscraper building falling down around me
Can you keep me from falling asleep again?

And falling too deep again

You built a wall, and I tore it down
You took a breath and stole the words out of my mouth
But what I wanted to say
I was trying to fix this with everything

Can you keep me from falling asleep tonight?
You're the only thing making me feel all right
Skyscraper building falling down around me
Can you keep me from falling asleep again?

What are we supposed to do?
We're still drowning in inches of water because of you
What do you want me to say?
I know what I did but I want you to stay

Can you keep me from falling asleep tonight?
You're the only thing making me feel all right
Skyscraper building falling down around me
Can you keep me from falling asleep again?
Can you keep me from falling asleep tonight?
You're the only thing making me feel all right
Skyscraper building falling down around me
Can you keep me from falling asleep again?

From falling asleep again

But I felt the pressure of water over my head
You weren't there when I started to sink again
I know we're running out of time
Right here, right now, you were holding on
But I let go, yeah, I let go
(Can you keep me from falling asleep tonight?)
I know we're running out of time

You said "what am I supposed to do?
We're still drowning in inches of water because of you"
What do you want me to say?
I know what I did but I really just want you to stay
