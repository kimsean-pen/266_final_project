I cried for you
Your turn to cry over me
I cried for you
What a fool I used to be
What a fool I used to be

I cried for you
Your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
That's one thing you're learning
That's one thing you're learning

Now I've found a heart just a little bit truer
Now I've found two eyes just a little bit bluer

I cried for you
Your turn to cry over me
I cried for you
What a fool I used to be
What a fool I used to be
What a fool I used to be
