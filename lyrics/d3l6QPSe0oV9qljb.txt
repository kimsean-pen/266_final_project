So he's holding me in his arms, and he's giving me sweet little kisses
And he's telling me he'll never harm me, and he's whispering how wonderful this is
And I tell him that I love him, and I tell him I'll be true
And I've said these things to other boys, but right now the old words feel so new
And I ask him "how did I get so lucky? I didn't even have to try"
"I don't know," he says, "I'm nothing special, I'm just some guy."

And he's smiling like he means it, and he's stretched out on his back
And he's telling me now that he loves me, for the fifth or the sixth time, I can't keep track
And I watch his eyes as they shine, run my fingers through his hair
And I touch his chest where his heart is, and I tell him "I find safe haven there"
And I ask him, "how did you get to be so sweet and so kind?"
"I don't know," he says, "I'm nothing special, I'm just some guy."
And I say "You're heart is so big, and your mind's so alive, you have passion and freedom and vision and drive, you have so much to give and you give it with care, you have helped me to heal, and there's nowhere I won't go with you."

And he's holding me, now, even tighter, and he's breathing me in
And he's telling me again that he loves me, and he's tracing his fingertips over my skin
And I'm happier now than I've ever been, and I'm hoping this feeling won't die
And if he says he's just some guy, that's fine, but the truth is, he's mine

My sweetheart, my love.
Sent down from the sky.
And so very much more than just some guy
