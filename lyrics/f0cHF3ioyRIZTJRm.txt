A fire burns, water comes
You cool me down
When I'm cold inside
You are warm and bright
You know you are so good for me, yeah

With your child's eyes
You are more than you seem
You see into space, I see in your face
The places you've been
The things you have learned
They sit with you so beautifully, yeah

And you know there's no need to hide away
You know I tell the truth
We are just the same
And I can feel everything you do
Hear everything you say
Even when you're miles away
'Cause I am me, the universe & u

Just like stars burning bright
Making holes in the night
We are building bridges

And you know there's no need to hide away
You know I tell the truth
We are just the same
And I can feel everything you do
Hear everything you say
Even when you're miles away
'Cause I am me, the universe & u
Oh, I am the universe & u

And when you're on your own
I'll send you a sign
Just so you know

That I am me, the universe & u
The universe & u
The universe & u
I am the universe & u
