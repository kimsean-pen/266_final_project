Anger, he smiles
towering in shiny metallic purple armour
queen jealousy, envy waits behind him
her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground
blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted
they quietly understand
once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready
but wonder why the fight is on
but they're all bold as love, yeah, they're all bold as love
yeah, they're all bold as love
just ask the axis
my red is so confident that he flashes trophies of war
and ribbons of euphoria
orange is young, full of daring
but very unsteady for the first go round
my yellow in this case is not so mellow
in fact i'm trying to say it's frigthened like me
and all these emotions of mine keep holding me from, eh
giving my life to a rainbow like you
but, i'm bold as love, yeah, i'm bold as love
yeah, yeah
well i'm bold, bold as love (hear me talking, girl)
i'm bold as love
just ask the axis (he knows everything)
yeah
yeah
yeah!
