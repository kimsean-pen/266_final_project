I've been walking through your streets
Where all your money's earning
Where all your buildings crying
And clueless neckties working
Revolving fake lawn houses
Housing all your fears
Desensitized by TV

Overbearing advertising
God of consumers
And all your crooked pictures looking good
Mirrors filtering information through the public eye
Designed for profiteering
Your neighbor, what a guy

Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom
Every time you drop the bomb
You kill the god your child has born
Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom

Modern globalization
Coupled with condemnations
Unnecessary death
Matador corporations
Puppeting your frustrations with a blinded flag
Manufacturing consent is the name of the game
The bottom line is money nobody gives a fuck

Four thousand hungry children
Leave us per hour from starvation
While billions are spent on bombs
Creating death showers

Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom
Every time you drop the bomb
You kill the god your child has born
Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom
Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom

Why must we kill our own kind?
Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom
Every time you drop the bomb
You kill the god your child has born
Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom
Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom
Every time you drop the bomb
