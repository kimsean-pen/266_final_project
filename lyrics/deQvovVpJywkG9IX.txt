Just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, they say it ain't that hard
But just puttin' one foot in front of the other ain't gettin' me too far
This movin' on ain't comin' along the way they said it would

I guess whoever said the grass is greener must've never seen the other side
What don't kill you makes you stronger sure sounds like a lie
And whoever said that time heals everything and everything will be alright?
Whoever said it ain't the end of the world, and you find somebody new
Must've never met you

Must've never heard you say you'd never leave me, then watch you walk away
Must've never fell as hard as I did 'cause ain't they what ain't say
Maybe it what meant to be yeah maybe you're better off alone

I guess whoever said the grass is greener must've never seen the other side
What don't kill you makes you stronger sure sounds like a lie
And whoever said that time heals everything and everything will be alright?
Whoever said it ain't the end of the world, and you find somebody new
Must've never met you, must've never met you

Maybe it what meant to be yeah maybe you're better off alone
Whoever said the grass is greener must've never seen the other side
What don't kill you makes you stronger still sounds like a lie
And whoever said that time heals everything and everything will be alright?
Whoever said it ain't the end of the world, you know she ain't the only girl
You win, you lose, you find somebody new
Must've never met you,
Oh must've never met you,
Must've never met you.
