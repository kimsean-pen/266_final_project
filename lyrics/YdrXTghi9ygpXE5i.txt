On Sunday night, lying in my bed
Thinking of a time when I was in your arms
The other day
Oh, it's been so long
I cannot see waiting for someone
That was always right in front of me
Why didn't I say something?
Didn't do something
When I knew right, yeah
You could be with me
Why was I so blind?
Why didn't I take time
And now you're gone, when
Baby, you could be with me
I'm lying in bed and I cannot sleep
Thinking of the things that you said to me, my baby
You're Out Of Reach
Tossing and turning
I cannot sleep
Hundred million things that
I did not say, my baby
You're Out Of Reach
You're Out Of Reach
If I could go back and rewind
I'd show you that you're more than just a friend
In every way I'd tell you all my secrets, boy
If you come back I'll never let you down!
I'll let you in! Oh, I'm lying in bed and
I cannot sleep Thinking of the things that you said to me, my baby
You're Out Of Reach Tossing and turning
I cannot sleep Hundred million things that
I did not say, my baby You're Out Of Reach
You're Out Of Reach Where are you now when the lights are low?
'Cause I'm thinking of you
I won't let you go, oh Why didn't
I say something? Didn't do something
When I knew right, yeah You could be with me
Oh, I'm lying in bed and I cannot sleep
Thinking of the things that you said to me, to me
Oh, I'm lying in bed and I cannot sleep
Thinking of the things that you said to me, to me (You're Out Of Reach)
