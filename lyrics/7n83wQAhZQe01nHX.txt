Cherish the moment
Feel inside

We sit in the same room
Side by side
I give you the wrong lines
Feed you

Accuracy, accuracy

Look into my eyes
We both smile
I could kill you
Without trying

That's accuracy
Accuracy
Accuracy

An observant prefers accuracy, accuracy
Practice all day for accuracy

Mirror mirror on the wall...
