Joanna
I can't forget the one they call Joanna
We owned the summer, hand in hand Joanna
And now she's always just a tear away
Goodbye you, you long lost summer
Leaving me behind you
Revealing things for lovers that may find you
I still hang on to every word that day, you passed my way
Joanna
You made the man a child again, so sweetly
He breathed your smile
Lived in your eyes completely
And on his heart there's still a trace of you
I love you but nothing in this world could make you mine
Yet still in time
Joanna
Joanna, you may remember me and change your mind

I love you but nothing in this world could make you mine
Yet still in time
Joanna
Joanna, you may remember me and change your mind
