Your touch, your taste
Your breath, your face
Your hands, your head
You're sweet, your love
Your teeth, your tongue
Your eye, you're mine
Your lips, you're fine
You're heaven on earth

I've waited all my life for you
My favorite kiss, your perfect skin, your perfect smile
Waking up and you're next to me (I feel you next to me)
Wrap me up in your arms and back to sleep

The palest green, I've never seen the color of your eyes
You've taken me so far away, one look and you stop time
The palest green, I've never seen the color of your eyes
You've taken me so far away, one look and you stop

Fell in love with you and everything that you are
Nothing I can do, I'm really crazy about you
When you're next to me, it's just like heaven on earth
You're heaven (you're heaven), you're heaven on earth
Tell me that I'll always be the one that you want
Don't know what I'd do if I ever lose you
Look at you and what I see is heaven on earth
I'm in love with you

Your breath, your face
Your hands, your head
You're sweet, your love
Your tongue

I'd move across the world for you (whole world)
Just tell me when, just tell me where, I'll come to you

Take me back to that place and time
Images of you occupy my mind

The palest green, I've never seen the color of your eyes
You've taken me so far away, one look and you stop time
The palest green, I've never seen the color of your eyes
You've taken me so far away, one look and you stop (yeah)

Fell in love with you and everything that you are
Nothing I can do, I'm really crazy about you
When you're next to me, it's just like heaven on earth
You're heaven (you're heaven), you're heaven on earth
Tell me that I'll always be the one that you want
Don't know what I'd do if I ever lose you
Look at you and what I see is heaven on earth
I'm in love with you

Fall off the edge of my mind (I'd fall off the edge of my mind)
I'd fall off the edge of my mind for you (when I just look at
you, I feel like I'm going to jump into heaven and you'll catch me)
I'd fall off the edge of my mind
(catch me if I jump. Will you catch me?)
Fall off the edge of my mind (taken me so far) for you

Fell in love with you and everything that you are (your touch...)
Nothing I can do, I'm really crazy about you
When you're next to me, it's just like heaven on earth (so in love)
You're heaven (you're heaven), you're heaven on earth
Tell me that I'll always be the one that you want
Don't know what I'd do if I ever lose you (you're heaven on earth)
Look at you and what I see is heaven on earth (you're heaven on earth)
I'm in love with you (so in love)

I'm so in love
Said, I'm so in love
Said, I'm so in love with you
Yeah yeah
Yeah, uh mmm
