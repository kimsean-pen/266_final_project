"Nein" dahter allez wider sich
"La stan, Tristan, versinne dich,
Niemer genim es keine war."
So wolte et ie daz herze dar;
Wider sinem willen crieget er,
Er gerte widerr, siner ger

"No," thought he, all against himself
Leave her alone, Tristan, consider this, come to your senses
It was never easy for anyone
The heart would ever have it so
He gets the opposite of what he wills
He desired against his own desire
