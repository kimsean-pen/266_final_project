Went to see the captain
Strangest I could find
Laid my proposition down
I laid it on the line
I won't slave for beggar's pay
Likewise gold and jewels
But I would slave to learn the way
To sink your ship of fools

Ship of fools
On a cruel sea
Ship of fools
Sail away from me

It was later than I thought
When I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter
Ship of fools

Saw you first ship sink and drown
From rockin' of the boat
And all that could not sink or swim
Was just left there to float
I won't leave you drifting down
But, whoa, it makes me wild
With thirty years upon my head
To have you call me child

Ship of fools
On a cruel sea
Ship of fools
Sail away from me

It was later than I thought
When I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter
Ship of fools

The bottles stand as empty
As they were filled before
And time that was in plenty
But from that cup no more
Though I would not caution all
I still might warn a few
Don't lend your hand to raise no flag
Atop no ship of fools

Ship of fools
On a cruel sea
Ship of fools
Sail away from me

It was later than I thought
When I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter
Ship of fools

It was later than I thought
When I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter
Ship of fools
