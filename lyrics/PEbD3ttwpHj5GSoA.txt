Over majestic peaks
We hail the fallen kings
Great warriors born to win
Celestial blazing steel

Millions of swords and shields
Flaming the coldest wind
Dark gate, primordial sin
Black legends now revealed

Legend revealed!

Tarish, your blood colored the snow
Why old friend, did you choose the lie?
May your soul now rest in peace
And still ascend to Heaven's glare

Erian's words in our hands
May dry the angels' frozen tears
I feel the way is still so long
This neverending tale will unfold
Will unfold

Old sacred wisdom
Great hope for all men
For countless kingdoms
For the whole known world

Spirits of winter, lead our way
Between the dangers of this cold land
These ancient pages can not be lost
The glory of Heavens clearly revealed

Sinister voices trapped in the wind
It's following us, dark creeping Har-Kuun
Silent snowfall, spare our lives
The hardest journey still has not began
Has not began

Old sacred wisdom
Great hope for all men
For countless kingdoms
For the whole known world

A new fate for gods and angels
Shines in our hands
The lost words of raging Heavens
Storms the walls of Kron

The ancient fires of Har-Kuun
The ancient fires of Har-Kuun
Har-Kuun, Har-Kuun

Illuminati sumus
Adhus divinitus
Praeditio maledictum
Infernus rex foedus
Hibernus tempus anni
Ventorum furia
Obscuritas naturae
Aeterna tenebra
