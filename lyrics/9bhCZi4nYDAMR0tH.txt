[solo throughout song]

How can you tell me?
I still believe in sometime
You don't have to make it a show or a begining
Just have to move yourself today

Alone...
Alone...
Alone...
Alone...

Wish you were there to tell me
I still need your sunshine
I'll go over and I'm bare foot
Can't believe I'm in the?

Alone...
Alone...
Alone...
Alone...

Now won't you tell me?
I still believe in some [?]
I try it oh so many ways to get to you
And it could never [?] [?] [?]

Alone...
Alone...
Alone...
Alone...

Why wont you tell me?
Now in the time, by my side
Re-tell the story
Guess I cant take it this time

Alone...
Alone...
Alone...
Alone...
