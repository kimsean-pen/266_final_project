The water is like turpentine
The meat I cannot chew
The tax man only want my gold
And robbed it from my boot
The law man threw me in here
Then tossed away the key
If faith is mine don't let me die
In this strange country

Went first into the city
No trouble did I seek
Until the law men of the crown
Bound cuffs of iron on me
But there was no trouble I had done
No slander did I speak
Wide eyed I was caught walking down
The wrong side of the street

The water is like turpentine
The meat I cannot chew
The tax man only want my gold
And robbed it from my boot
The law man threw me in here
The tossed away the key
If faith is mine don't let me die
In this strange country

I long to cross the border line
And smell the new born hay
But in this dungeon I will lie
Until I rot away

The water is like turpentine
The meat I cannot chew
The tax man only want my gold
And robbed it from my boot
The law man threw me in here
Then tossed away the key
If faith is mine don't let me die
In this strange country
