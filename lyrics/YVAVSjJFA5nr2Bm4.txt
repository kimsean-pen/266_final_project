Dreams
That's where I have to go
To see your beautiful
Face anymore I stare at a picture of you
And listen to the radio
Hope, hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation

I know that much is understood
And I realise
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out, and I sit down at a table set for two

And finally I'm forced to face the truth

No matter what I say I'm
Not over you
Not over you
Damn, damn girl you do it well
and I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell

but still your magnificent
I, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me

I turn around and I'm back in the game
even better than the old me
But I'm not even close without you
If you ask me how I'm doing

I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out, and I sit down at a table set for two

And finally I'm forced to face the truth

No matter what I say I'm
Not over you
And if I had the chance to re-new
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do

I could get back, on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced
So until then
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out, and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say I'm...
Not over you
Not over you
Not over you
Not over you
