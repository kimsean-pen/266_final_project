And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead
Miscellaneous
Another Morning Stoner

Are you asleep, are you in a dream?
The copper shades of a morning
Distant lights beckon & fade
Unwritten songs of another day
I fear that you would never be
Every song in the world for me
I took your hand, led you astray
You cursed the worlds I longed to save
Is heaven to you a perfect place?
The look of sorrow on a sufferer's face?
A field of lives to sow and reap
That some of us will never see
Why is it I don't feel the same?
Are my longings to be blamed
For not seeing heaven like you would see;
Why is a song a world for me?
What is forgiveness?
It's just a dream.
What is forgiveness?
It's everything.
