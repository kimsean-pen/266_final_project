Together we go, walking at a pace
I hear the whistle blowing in the distance
You say there's an elm tree

Good night...
We see the birds fly away
To their nest in the forest
Together we go home
You'll never be alone

To home, to home
We hurry our way home
Your shadow hurries me up
As if it were the only hope
