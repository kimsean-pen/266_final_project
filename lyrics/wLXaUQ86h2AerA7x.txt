All my presence died today
I breathe to memories
Guess I'm closing down
Torn and tired of my heart's sound
What's worth to me
When life's not around
I will sleep tonight
To sleep tomorrow
If I sleep at last
A promise has been broken
The essence of Love in rust
One in a million
I'm the one turning pale
Any colours to express
Apart from bleak is hard
And where you are
My thoughts are in guilt
So forget me
Forget me not
Time to catch something
Since my ticket says the end
All my flowers withered today
The room is quiet
Gues it's Growing cold
Dead calm without my heart's sound
What's worth to you
When I'm not around
I will sleep tonight
To sleep tomorrow
If I sleep at last
