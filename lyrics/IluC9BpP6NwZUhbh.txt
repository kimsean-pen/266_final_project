Splits are parted and they're parting later
Go to bed now, it's in your soul
Gonna see me goin' inside
Gonna see me goin' inside
Oh, I could love you
Oh, that'd be easy

Moved to free house with violent people
Roam the streets at night
Born to love your jagged sound
Sing a decent dime
Oh, I could love you
Oh, I could make it easy

Took the kid out, I am him
Simply God take it to Israel
I could see love and God
If you need it, see it
This is all
Won't you fall?

Since I started pouring easy
Things have all fell in line
I will never figure it out
Didn't they come in time?
Oh, I could find you
Oh, then you'd be easy
