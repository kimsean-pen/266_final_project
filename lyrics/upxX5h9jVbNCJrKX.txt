You know it's Johnny 3 when you watch that body fall
When you fuck with J3T, he's like "fuck it, kill 'em all"
Ain't nobody, bad boy, we'll feed you to them fucking dogs
I'll keep on playing saint, you keep begging me to stop
I ain't a good shot, baby, but I'm on a roll
You better get down, lady, someone's turning cold
Now it's time to meet your maker, hear the tolling of the bell
Fucking kill you again when I see you in hell
Now it's time to meet your maker, hear the tolling of the bell
Fucking kill you again when I see you in hell, bitch

Shut your eyes, let darkness lead the fight, say goodnight
The rest will watch their future die, buried alive, say goodnight
It's time to let now the dead, dead come alive, we wave the flag for the rest of our lives
So shut your eyes, let darkness lead the fight, say goodnight, say goodnight

You know it's hard to breathe with the knife up to your throat
And it's impossible to see down the barrel of smoke
And now you're starting to choke, you hope it's all in your mind
It's time to hit the deck like it's a fucking drive-by
It ain't possible to manage all the carnage and the damage
And an animal like me can use it all to my advantage
You're the first to hit the floor 'cause you know that we stay lit
We're kicking in your door 'cause we ain't nothing to fuck with
You're the first to hit the floor 'cause you know that we stay lit
We're kicking in your door 'cause we ain't nothing to fuck with

Shut your eyes, let darkness lead the fight, say goodnight
The rest will watch their future die, buried alive, say goodnight
It's time to let now the dead, dead come alive, we wave the flag for the rest of our lives
So shut your eyes, let darkness lead the fight, say goodnight, say goodnight

There's a black flag hanging over this town
Get down, get down
There's a black flag hanging over this town
Get down, get down
There's a black flag hanging over this town
Get down, get down
There's a black flag hanging over this town
Get down, get down

And the land of the weak will put you to sleep
Put you to sleep, yeah, put you to sleep
Look to the sky as you beg for your life
Beg for your life, yeah, beg for your life

Shut your eyes, let darkness lead the fight, say goodnight
The rest will watch their future die, buried alive, say goodnight
It's time to let now the dead, dead come alive, we wave the flag for the rest of our lives
So shut your eyes, let darkness lead the fight, say goodnight, say goodnight
