Somewhere between an excuse and a lie
You found something that you believe
So proud, I guess I can't imagine why
Three cheers for what we used to be

Pathetic, wasted, soulless, compromised

Sleep-walking in the mine field
Shit talking, it crumbles around you
It comes back around

Somewhere between delusion and denial
You'll drown in your own sympathy
Profound, at least you thought so at the time
A ghost of who you used to be

Pathetic, wasted, soulless, compromised
Pathetic, wasted, soulless, compromised

Sleep-walking in the mine field
Shit talking, it crumbles around you
It comes back around
It comes back around

Sleep-walking in the mine field
Shit talking, it crumbles around you
It comes back around

Pathetic, wasted, soulless, compromised
Pathetic, wasted, soulless, compromised
Pathetic, wasted, soulless, compromised
Pathetic, wasted, soulless, compromised
Pathetic, wasted, soulless, compromised
Pathetic, wasted, soulless, compromised
Pathetic, wasted, soulless, compromised
