When I was fourteen
I thought you could save me
Thought there were no maybes
Believed everything
One day, when I am young I'll see

Rows of mountains fall away in evergreen
Shrouded in the mist, the mystery
Conform to every living thing
One day, when you are young you'll see

When we were just lambs
We thought we'd never be the sheep
Walked tight circles 'round broke-necked birds
Falling from the trees

Shrouded in the mist, the mystery
Connects us to each lying thing
One day, when we are young we'll see

Way down to the center of the earth
And way out to the edge of the universe
(And what you need's not what you believe)
Your body is, your body is the world
(I'm gonna fade out now, goodbye)
Your body is, your body is the world

But all around, there is no other
Find out your body is the world
(I'm gonna fade out now, goodbye)
Your body is, your body is the world
