Used to be that I believed in something
Used to be that I believed in love
It's been a long time since I've had that feeling
I could love someone
I could trust someone
I said I'd never let nobody near my heart again darlin'
I said I'd never let nobody in, but

If you asked me to
I just might change my mind and let you in my life, forever
If you asked me to
I just might give my heart and stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to
If you asked me to
Oh, yeah

Somehow ever since I've been around you
Can't go back to being on my own
Can't help feeling darling since i've found you
That I've found my home
That I'm finally home
I said I'd never let nobody get too close to me darling
I said I needed, needed to be free

But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind and let you in my life, forever
If you asked me to
I just might give my heart and stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to
If loving you

Ask me to, I will give my world to you baby
I need you now
Ask me to, and I'll do anything
For you baby, for you baby

(If you asked me to)
I'd let you in my life forever
(If you asked me to)
All you gotta do is ask me to
All you gotta do, all you gotta do
All you gotta do is ask me to
(If you asked me to)
I'll give you my world
I'll give you my heart
Everything, everything baby
Just ask me to
I think want ask me what to do
Just ask me to
If you asked me to
