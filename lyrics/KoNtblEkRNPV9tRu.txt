Talking like that... We're gonna fall
Talking like that, talking like that...

I don't know when it all started
いつの間にかこうして
Guided by my own beating heart
鼓動の赴くまま

何度も you said you loved me
このまま have the time of my life
二人でいる時間は
I've never felt this way in my life oh

ふと目が合ったあの時から
物語は始まっていた
I could be free (yeah) I want to stay

Talking like that
We got it fallin', talking like that
We got it fallin', talking like that
'Cuz we are like that uuh uh uh
Talking like that

I would do it over again
もし君さえ良かったら
No matter what happens to us
心に感じるまま

何度も Made love together
解ってる staring into your eyes
この気持ちを知ったら
There is no way I am turning back oh

その手に触れたあの時から
言葉もなく夢中になった
I could be free (yeah), I want to stay

Talking like that
We got it fallin', talking like that
We got it fallin', talking like that
'Cuz we are like that uuh uh uh
Talking like that

Ah ゆっくり激しく抱きしめ全て忘れ
夜に溶けていく I can't get enough
Yea yea yea このままずっと fallen

ふと目が合ったあの時から
物語は始まっていた
I could be free (yeah) I want to stay
