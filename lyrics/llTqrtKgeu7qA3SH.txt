Ghostcity, stay if you wanna
Don't leave me, why do we leave this town?
Can you see it now?

Your lips suit with grey
You know you shoot me, cause you wanna me dead
Can we leave this town?
Will we go now?

These different shadows always following me
The city foxers are controlling the streets
Would you leave me out here?
Could you leave me out here?

Cause we are the only one alive in this town
When everything is going down, maybe we can be ghosts as well

Dark hair covered with gold
I keep forgetting everything I stole
Can we leave this town?
Will you leave me now?

These different shadows always following me
The city foxers are controlling the streets
Would you leave me out here?
Could you leave me out here?

Cause we are the only one alive in this town
When everything is going down, maybe we can be ghosts as well
