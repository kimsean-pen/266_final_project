Well I wonder what it's like to be a rainmaker
I wonder what it's like to know that I made the rain
I'd store it in boxes with little yellow tags on every one
And you can come and see them when I'm done
When I'm done
I wonder what it's like to be a super hero
I wonder where I'd go if I could fly around downtown, yeah
From some other planet, I'd get this funky high on the yellow sun
Boy I bet my friends will all be stunned
They're stunned
Yeah, yeah

Straight up, what did you hope to learn about here
If I was someone else, would this all fall apart
Strange, where were you, when we started this gig
I wish the real world, would just stop hasslin' me
And you, and you, and me

Well I wonder what it's like to be the head honcho
I wonder what I'd do if they all did just what I said
(that's what I said)
Well I'd shout out an order
I think we're out of this man get me some
Boy don't make me wanna change my tone
My tone
Yeah, yeah
Straight up, what did you hope to learn about here
If I was someone else, would this all fall apart
Strange, where were you, when we started this gig
I wish the real world, would just stop hasslin' me
Please don't change, please don't break
'Cause the only thing that seems to work at all is you
Please don't change, at all from me
To you, and you to me hey, hey

Yeah, yeah
Straight up, what did you hope to learn about here
If I was someone else, would this all just fall apart
Strange, where were you, when we started this gig
I wish the real world, would just stop hasslin' me
I wish the real world, would just stop hasslin' me
I wish the real world, would just stop hasslin' me
And you, and me
