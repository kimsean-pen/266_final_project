When I'm blowin out the candles
And when people start to sing
I will always cross my fingers tight
I remember everything

But I always make my wishes
For the same thing everytime
If I live to be one hundred
If I ever it getting right

My mind is racing with thoughts
And the songs that never end
And I prayed to God last night
Just before I went to bed

Even now I can't remember
A single word He said
If I live to be one hundred
If I get it through my head

I always think about you

And I have to close my eyes
If I live to be one hundred
Will I ever cross your mind

When you close your eyes at night
And you rise above your life
Do you notice there's an empty space
Where I wasn't by your side

Because I always dream about you
Every time I close my eyes
If I live to be one hundred
Will I ever cross your mind

I always make my wishes
For same thing every time
If I live to be one hundred
Will I ever cross your mind
