You brushed your teeth and found your calling at the bottom of a swamp
There was no air but to be clear darkness was all you wanted
And now just floating to the surface hoping to find some kind of light
Revised your look but something stinks and you will never smell right

There's a crooked line that runs through every crease in this map
And you want to take us all the way back

To see the rot in no disguise
Oh what a time to be alive
The scum, the shame, the fucking lies
Oh what a time to be alive
Oh what a time to be alive

You've been carving tales for dummies out of live oak and out of pine
Let's turn your heroes into mummies throw them straight onto the fire
Yeah just below the surface lurking a shadow breathing through a straw
Clinging to the myth that you were cheated
Oh the myth that you were robbed

And there's a crooked line that runs through every crease in this map
And you want to take us all the way back

To see the rot in no disguise
Oh what a time to be alive
The scum, the shame, the fucking lies
Oh what a time to be alive
Oh what a time to be alive

We can't pretend to be surprised
Oh what a time to be alive
The seasons change and some survive
Oh what a time to be alive
Oh what a time to be alive
Oh what a time to be alive
Oh what a time to be alive

Oh what a time
To be alive
