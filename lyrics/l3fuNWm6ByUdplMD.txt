New love, new fun, new me
Isn't that the way it's supposed to be
New fear, nothings clear to me
And that's how it's always gonna be
I've never been real sure of myself
Never trusted someone else
Something in you puts my fears to rest

Well bring it up and never touch the ground
And when you need me i'll be around
This is how it's gonna be if you don't get sick of me

She loved me and i loved her
It was all so fun and new
We were going to go all over the world
And do everything there is to do
But something spoiled out plans
We couldn't meet our own demands
Every problem put us to the test

We brought it up and we let it down
And when she needed me i wasn't around
That was how it had to be then she just got sick of me

Relationships deteriorate i've seen it from the start
Easy as it is to fall in love, its easier to fall apart
I won't let it fall apart

Bring it up and never touch the ground
And when you need me i'll be around
This is how it's gonna be if you dont get sick of me
Well hold it up and never let it down
And when you need me i'll be around
This is how it's gotta be so you don't get sick of me
So you don't get sick of me
So you don't get sick of me
