When I get you home
I'll never let you go
Too bad it never lasts long
When I'm all alone
You creep into my mind
And I pretend it's you by my side

You look a little better, each day to me
And you try a little harder each day to be
Everything that I wanted in you
And do everything that I need you to do

Morning dreams come true
Cause I wake up next to you
And only for your eyes
Do I sing these lullabies

Everything you do is all I need to know
Cause I'm yours
I'll never let you down
Anywhere you are is where I want to be
Anywhere, anytime or place

You look a little better, each day to me
And you try a little harder each day to be
Everything that I wanted in you
And do everything that I need you to do

Morning dreams come true
Cause I wake up next to you
And only for your eyes
Do I sing these lullabies

You look a little better, each day to me
And you try a little harder each day to be

Morning dreams come true
Cause I wake up next to you
And only for your eyes
Do I sing these lullabies

Morning dreams come true
Morning dreams come true
Morning dreams come true
Morning dreams come true
