Oh, loveless
Oh, loveless
Oh, loveless girl
Oh, loveless
Oh, loveless
Oh, loveless girl

Haven't seen you in a while
You look much older
And your hair used to fall so perfectly
It's making me wonder
What you did in those years I didn't see you?
Did you make your television breakthrough?
You never liked it when I wanted attention sometimes
I'll pretend you look fine, we'll laugh awkwardly
Make conversation about our families

Loveless girl, that's what you used to call me
That's all I'll ever be
I wonder if you changed your mind
Am I different this time?
Loveless girl

Oh, loveless
Oh, loveless
Oh, loveless girl
Oh, loveless
Oh, loveless
Oh, loveless girl

You've not changed in the way that you look at me
But I was never who you wanted me to be
You always said I was so cold, but only with you though
Only with you though

Loveless girl, that's what you used to call me
That's all I'll ever be
I wonder if you changed your mind
Am I different this time?
Loveless girl

Lately I've been wondering if you'd come back
You're so predictable, I hate that
I've really changed, you know I don't feel the same
I never thought we'd make it anyway

Loveless girl, that's what you used to call me
That's all I'll ever be
I wonder if you changed your mind
Am I different this time?
Loveless girl

Oh, loveless
Oh, loveless
Oh, loveless girl
Oh, loveless
Oh, loveless
Oh, loveless girl
Oh, loveless
Oh, loveless
Oh, loveless girl
Oh, loveless
Oh, loveless
Oh, loveless girl
