This is entitled ebony dressed for sunset

Unshadow thyselves children
The reign in flesh begins again

Vempire
Funereal majesty awake
Cneajna wreathed in snake
Draconis talons rake

So haunted is my silent heart
Dreaming only of the moon
When velvet darkness falls tonight
The thirst crescends anew

Only for you

Inspired to mortal nightmare
Ebony dressed for sunset
In the dulcet whispers of the damned
