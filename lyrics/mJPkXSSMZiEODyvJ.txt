I saw you colour the air around you
You heard the music a different way
You had no boundaries, they bent to your rules
A new kind of sacred
Whatever you say I'll follow

Didn't expect
Falling like that
Doesn't make sense
Never done this
But I don't wanna ever change this
Touching me right
Talking it just the way I like it
I can't help it

Thank you for fucking up my life, baby
Your body's got me changing my mind, honey
Even better on the inside, baby
No going back after the first bite
Bet you know when it's right
Baby

I knew the minute I pulled you closer
I had to question the plans I'd made
Gave up my cold world to keep you warmer
Now my life is naked
Is it worth the pain that it costs

Didn't expect
Falling like that
Doesn't make sense
Never done this
But I don't wanna ever change this
Touching me right
Talking it just the way I like it
I can't help it

Thank you for fucking up my life, baby
Your body's got me changing my mind, honey
Even better on the inside, baby
No going back after the first bite
Bet you know when it's right
Baby

Caught in the middle
Known to be no more
Caught in the middle
If we met for the first time now
Would I say goodbye?

Sorry for fucking up your life, baby
I wonder if I'm still on your mind, honey
And do you hide it on the inside
No going back after the first bite

Thank you for fucking up my life baby
Your body's got me changing my mind, honey
Even better on the inside, baby
No going back after the first bite
Beg you know when it's right
