Take it always slowly piece by piece
You got this funny idea that youll eventually release
Naming can be costly itll never be discreet
You hold it in your dreams because its easy to believe

Beastly, peel the layers back see me/feel you right on track

Fancy enough feel feel you caught around your sleeve
feel you caught up inbetween feel shes to good to be seen
Chance it for a nice you feel it something uncomplete
Close your eyes towards the seas, while all unravel at the seams

And if the tricks dont fool enough its only us its only rough
we didnt sink enough we didnt sing enough

And if the pools not smooth its strong we'll float along
never minding that both of the oars are gone
We didnt sink enough

Switch and row
Even with 8 hands i cant bear this pull alone
This sinking feeling inside is to heavy a low
its to heavy a high its to heavy a low

And if the tricks dont fool enough its only us its only rough
