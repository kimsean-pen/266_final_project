Holding back the fear again
Try to make it real again
Fight against the past
Hide away from everything
Under static sentiment
We can make it last

Love inside of me
Another kind of life
Standing on the ice
Where are you now
Open my eyes
For the final time
For the final time

So glad to see you my friend
Hold on to the space again
Everything unfolds
Possibly another way
Thinking of you every day
We are going home

Love inside of me
Another kind of life
Standing on the ice
Where are you now
Open my eyes
For the final time
For the final time

Love inside of me
Another kind of life
Standing on the ice
Where are you now
Open my eyes
For the final time
For the final time
