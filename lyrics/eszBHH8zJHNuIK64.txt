Consume communion
Feast on his remains
Absurd absolution
Confess your sins away

Birth from the virgin mother
Spread your holy legs
Bastard father absent
No one cares that you've been slain

Amongst shattered
Wrongly sentenced and banished
Aligned pagans
Fellow accused heathens
Labeled diferente
Sign of the elite

Answer his call
Answer his call
The coming purge
The coming purge

Can't escape death
Can't escape death
Your life is mine
Your life is mine

Excommunicated
And the death of your lord
Beheaded holy savior
And to bathe in his gore

Excommunicated
Will evaporated
Soul annihilated
Excommunicated

Detest preachers
Servants of the mindless
Weakly penance
All for spiritual gain

It came on high
To rid me of existence
Facade of religion
In its conclusion

Look to the sky
And give your soul to him
Pay with your life
Your penance put to death

Excommunicated
Will evaporated
Soul annihilated

Excommunicated
Missed the call from your god
Total desecration from the christ and the cross

Excommunicated
Will evaporated
Soul annihilated
Excommunicated.
