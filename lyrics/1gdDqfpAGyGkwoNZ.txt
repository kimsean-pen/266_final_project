Well, I've been saved by the grace of southern charm
I got a mouth like a sailor and yours is more like a Hallmark card
If you wanna pick a fight, well, I'm gonna have to say good night
I don't have to be hateful, I can just say, "Bless your heart"

And even though I don't belong with your high life friends
Doesn't mean we don't get together and try to make amends
It's easier can't you see? Let's agree to just disagree
We don't have to like each other but it's sure fun to pretend

So let's shake hands and reach across those party lines
You got your friend just like I got mine
We might think a little differently
But we got a lot in common you will see
We're just like you, only prettier

Everybody says you gotta know your enemies
Even if they only weigh a hundred pounds and stand five foot three
If you just smile and behave you can always get your way
It's a universal plan that'll get you where you can in all societies

So let's shake hands and reach across those party lines
You got your friend just like I got mine
We might think a little differently
But we got a lot in common you will see
We're just like you, only prettier, hey

Let's shake hands and reach across those party lines
You got your friend just like I got mine
We might think a little differently
But we got a lot in common you will see
We're just like you, only prettier

Well, I'll keep drinkin' and you'll keep gettin' skinnier
I'm just like you, only prettier
