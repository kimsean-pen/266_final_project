Get your feet off the ground
Get the fuck out of town
I need a different scene
I gott a b-b-b-break free
It's going down, down, down, down, down
Couldn't find words to say
Everybody's in the way
That's okay, could care less anyway
I've got a reason to live
I've got a reason to love
I've got a reason to kill
I'll never walk away
Forget about yesterday
When all of the hate
Is too much to take
Live for today
Nothing ever stays the same
And I try to mask the pain
'Cause it's eating me alive
I've gotta cut the tie
I'm going down, down, down, down, down
I'll never walk away
Forget about yesterday
When all of the hate
Is too much to take
Live for today
Just speak and the world will listen
We're living in double vision
With nowhere left to run
You will find a way to live for today
My life is falling to pieces
You're the only one that's needed
To keep from falling down
From falling down
I'll never walk away
Forget about yesterday
When all of the hate
Is too much to take
Live for today
Just speak and the world will listen
We're living in double vision
With nowhere left to run
You will find a way to live for today
I'll never walk away
Forget about yesterday
When all of the hate
Is too much to take
Live for today
Just speak and the world will listen
We're living in double vision
With nowhere left to run
You will find a way to live for today
I'll never walk away
