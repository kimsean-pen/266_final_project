I kiss myself when I'm feeling lonely
Talk to myself when no one hears me
And you were miles away when I needed
Someone to calm me down, say "girl breathe in"
And I am not ashamed to be lonely
But i'm afraid to feel it so deeply

Look in the mirror until I blush
Eat myself until I get stuffed
And I was miles away when you needed
Someone to sit on your face, screaming keep me
And I am not ashamed to be lonely
But I'm afraid to feel it so deeply
