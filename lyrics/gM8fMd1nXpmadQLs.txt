If you could envision
The meaning of a tragedy
Ooh, you might be
Surprised to hear it's you and me.

When it comes down to it
You never made the most of it.
Ooh, so I cry, cry, cried
And now I say goodbye.

And I won't be made a fool of
Don't call this love.

When did you decide
That I didn't have enough to buy?
Forgive and forget you a thousand times
For the fire and the sleepless nights.

And I won't be made a fool of
Don't call this love.
Don't call this love.

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, love, love
La, la, la, la, la, love, love
La, la, la, la, love, love

Why did you feel the need
To prove that everybody else was right?
No, I won't fight.

Oh, you're my tragedy, tragedy
Oh, you're my tragedy, oh
This is, oh, no no n-no

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, love, love
La, la, la, la, la, love, love
La, la, la, la, love, love
La, la, la, love
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, love, love
La, la, la, la, la, love, love
La, la, la, la, love, love
La, la, la, love
