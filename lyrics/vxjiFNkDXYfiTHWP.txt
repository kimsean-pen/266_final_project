Crunch a number, grind your gears
Crunch a number root out a stiff
Then tightly squeeze
Wretch after wretch, after wretch, after wretch

Non expressive matter
Designated to perish
Smash a single, smash a single digit
Smash a single, smash a single, smash a single digit
Wretch follows wretch, wretch follows wretch

Cleave to progress, rotate the cull
Cleave to progress, this ranks
Lower than collateral
Louse after Louse, after Louse, after Louse

Non reflective minions
Who must labour and perish
Smash a single, smash a single, smash a single digit
Smash a single, smash a single, smash a single digit
Wretch follows wretch, wretch follows wretch

As there is no lower to plunge
No heed is paid to consequences
There's no sum when you're not apart
There's no sum when you're not apart
You're not apart
