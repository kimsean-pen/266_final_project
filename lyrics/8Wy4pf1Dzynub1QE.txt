Misery loves company?
That don't mean a thing to me

I've seen the future where I don't wanna die
Sorrow wrapped around my heart like an unwanted vine
I've seen the future breaks the burden of my past
Painted black and all forgotten; you lit the fire in my heart

Sorrow floats where my dreams won't
Yeah, sorrow floats where my dreams won't

Misery loves company?
Loves company, loves company
That don't mean a thing to me
Nothing to me, nothing to me

I've seen the future, and I wanted to live
Gotta think of that life each time I'm crossing a bridge
If hope floats and sorrow too, I guess I'll just hold onto you
The only one who really knows what I've been through

Sorrow floats where my dreams won't
Yeah, sorrow floats where my dreams won't

Misery loves company?
Loves company, loves company
That don't mean a thing to me
Nothing to me, nothing to me
Misery loves company?
Loves company, loves company
That don't mean a thing to me
Nothing to me, nothing to me

I just wanna die
I just wanna die, die
Black out the sun when I'm feeling low
Pull back the hammer when it's time to go

Misery loves company?
Loves company, loves company
That don't mean a thing to me
Nothing to me, nothing to me
Misery loves company?
Loves company, loves company
That don't mean a thing to me
Nothing to me, nothing to me

Loves company, loves company
Nothing to me, nothing to me
Loves company, loves company
Nothing to me, nothing to me
