Don't wake me up tonight
I'll be dreaming of you if that's alright
I like you better in my sleep
there in my thoughts I'll keep things right

Don't wake me up if you do
my liking for you might disappear
Can't find this like in real time
but in my dreams this crime is crystal clear

Lovin' is easy to do
when my imagintion gets the best of
You-oh-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh

Lovin's is easy to keep
when you're the reason that I fall asleep to
Dream of you, dream of you
You-oh-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Don't wake me up if you find
I'm intertwined and confused between the two
Crazy is this hazy pull, that draws me close
I haven't got a clue

I tried to detach from the latch
that's got it's claws tightly grasped in my skin
I wake up to find nothing there
I'd tell you this but you already don't care

Lovin' is easy to do
when my imagintion gets the best of
You-oh-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh

Lovin's is easy to keep
when you're the reason that I fall asleep to
Dream of you, dream of you
You-oh-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Infatuation by imagination why
are we the right pair in
a world that's not there when
Woken it's spoken you're
a worthless token that's
cha cha cha choken me out
faken me out with a shout
of interest that's dismissed
we could have been it
we could have been it

Lovin' is easy to do
when my imagintion gets the best of
You-oh-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh

Lovin's is easy to keep
when you're the reason that I fall asleep to
Dream of you, dream of you
You-oh-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
