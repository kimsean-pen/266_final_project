When somebody reaches for your heart
Open up and let them through
'Cause everybody needs someone around
Things can tumble down on you

You'll discover when you look around
You don't have to be alone
Just one lover is all you need to know
When you're feeling all alone

Oh, you might need somebody
You might need somebody too
(You might need somebody too)

You might need somebody too
(You might need somebody too)

Yeah yeah
Ohhhh
Baby baby

If there's fire stiring in your heart
And you're sure its strong and right
Keep it burning through the cold and dark
It can warm the lonely nights

Oh, you might need somebody
You might need somebody too
(You might need somebody too)

You might need somebody too
(You might need somebody too)

Oh, you might need somebody too
(Need somebody)
Yeah
Oh, you're gonna need somebody too
(Need somebody)
Yeah yeah
You might need somebody too, baby
(Need somebody)
Oh I do
Oooh, I know I do
Need somebody too...
