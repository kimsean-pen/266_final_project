Happy little day
Jimmy went away
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday
A happy pair they made
So decorously laid
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade

It's so good to know
There's still a little magic in the air
I'll weave my spell

Jenny, will you stay?
Tarry me with pray
Nothing 'ere need come between us
Tell me, love, what do you say?

Oh, no, I must away
To my mum in disarray
If my mother should discover
How I spent my holiday

It would be of small avail
To talk of magic in the air
I'll say farewell

Oh, rock of ages
Do not crumble, love is breathing still
Oh, lady moonshine down
A little people magic if you will

Jenny pines away
Writes a letter every day
We must ever be together
Nothing can my love erase

Oh, no, I'm compromised
I must apologise
If my lady should discover
How I spent my holidays
