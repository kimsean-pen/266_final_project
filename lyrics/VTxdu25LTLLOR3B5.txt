Magnetic stare,
Electric eyes,
They pull me away,
She said I've got you hypnotized,
So come with me.

Anywhere you wanna go,
Anywhere the wind blows,
Always high and never low,
In the middle of the sunshine,
Or washed in the starlight,
Anyplace or anytime

Mind blowing lips,
Narcotic hips,
I finally see,
The Eight-fold path,
Enlightenment,
The Stairway of Dreams

Anywhere you wanna go,
Anywhere the wind blows,
Always high and never low,
In the middle of the sunshine,
Or washed in the starlight,
Anyplace or anytime

Anywhere you wanna go,
Anywhere the wind blows,
Always high and never low,
In the middle of the sunshine,
Or washed in the starlight,
Anyplace or anytime
