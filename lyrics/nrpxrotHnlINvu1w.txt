She's all
you'll ever dream to find,
On her stage
she sings her story.
Pain and hurt
will steal her heart tonight,
Like a queen
in all her glory.

And when she cries diva,
he's an angel,
When she laughs,
she's a devil,
She is all
beauty and love.

Viva Maria
Viva Victoria
Aphrodita
Viva la diva
Viva Victoria
Cleopatra

Silent tears
drop from these eyes tonight,
Tears of prayer
for all those aching hearts
And when she cries diva,
he's an angel,
When she laughs,
she's a devil,
She is all
beauty and love.

Viva Maria
