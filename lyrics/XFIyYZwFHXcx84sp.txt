Yea you're my lover, somehow still my friend
We use one another to believe
We could be lovers and somehow still be in a band
Doing what others call make believe

Yea lets do with me and you everything were told not to
Break the rules, top the charts
Baby break my heart and call it off

Maybe we're crazy, checking history
Business and pleasure rarely mix
And if you get caught up don't get in too deep
Business and pleasure hard to fix

We'll make it work and bring it back
Like Jude and John, and Fleetwood Mac
Stay together for the kids
Stevie Knicks they love that shit

Yea lets do with me and you everything were told not to
Break the rules, top the charts
Baby break my heart and call it off

We'll make it and bring it back
Like Jude and John, and Fleetwood Mac
Stay together for the kids
Stevie Knicks
