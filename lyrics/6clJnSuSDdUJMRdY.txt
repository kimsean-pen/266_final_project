Found the morning liquor found the morning light
Look into the rearview mirror the motherfuckers are all awaiting him down the line
Sick and tired of fighting, all the crap inside
Starting a new day, breathing the morning, got a feeling leaving something behind
He sees the lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely day
Left his car out in the desert forever more
He's got another life now to explore

And forever you will hear the people talk, how they can hear his boots out in the cold
And the fallen will get down on his knees
And forever the man in the coat
Will cast his shadow among those who know
the tale of the gangster who shot all his demons for good
Then along came the mirror and the ripper
What do you see in the night?
Passing shadows that can scar your soul, and make you feel demonized

Hear a match and see the lightning from the ripper
What do you have in your mind?
We believe that he comes for another wicked destiny night
Dazing in the dark the life line going cold in the fire
Have you asked yourself what it is what you see?
Well, is it Mr. Cadillac or you?
Walking among those who nearly found peace

Into the light, and out of the blue
And the fallen will get down on his knees
And forever the man in the coat
Will cast his shadow among those who know

the tale of the gangster who shot all his demons for good
Then along came the mirror and the ripper
What do you see in the night?
Passing shadows that can scar yoursoul, and make you feel demonized

Hear a match and see the lightning from the ripper
What do you have in your mind?
We believe that he comes for another wicked destiny night
Dazing in the dark the life line going cold in the fire
Look into his eyes you'll meet a hundred angels cry
Face the mirror you gonna seek another day
you gonna face the mirror you gonna seek another day
you gonna face the mirror you gonna seek another day
you gonna face the mirror you gonna seek another day
you gonna ooooh
Going lonely home
