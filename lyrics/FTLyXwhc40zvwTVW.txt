I only call when I'm alone
I only call when I'm alone
I only call when I'm alone
I only call when I'm alone

Touch me in the morning
I'll tell you while you're moanin', baby
There's something in this water
So drink it 'til you're fallin' for me
Touch me in the morning
I'll tell you while you're moanin', baby
There's something in this water
So drink it 'til you're fallin' for me

Touch me in the morning
Touch me in the morning

I only call when I'm alone
I only call when I'm alone
I only call when I'm alone
I only call when I'm alone

Touch me in the morning
I'll tell you while you're moanin', baby
There's something in this water
So drink it 'til you're fallin' for me
Touch me in the morning
I'll tell you while you're moanin', baby
There's something in this water
So drink it 'til you're fallin' for me

Touch me in the morning
