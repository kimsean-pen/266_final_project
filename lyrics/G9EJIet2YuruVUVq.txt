Spent two years of my life in a foreign land.
Came home to my own wife, had a different man.
Saw fifteen sons and fathers lying on the ground.
Just one click of my thumb, everybody's down.

Oh it seems that this had become a dream.
Life ain't just what it seems.
Still run by ancient schemes.

And oh, it shows
On the faces of those that know.
Blood flows where the money's stowed
Try to getcha hands on gold(?)

But hey, what is anybody tryin'a say?

Spent two years of my life in a foreign land,
Came home to find my mind still stuck in the sand.
There are things I never thought that I could do.
I had to tell myself "Did 'em all for you."

Oh it seems that this had become a dream.
Life ain't just what it seems,
Still run by ancient schemes.

And oh, it shows
On the faces of those who know.
Blood flows where the money's stowed.
Gotta get your hands on gold(?)

But hey, what is anybody gonna say?
