Said all these people they won't leave me alone
And we need a little time to ourselves
And half the reasons why
I'm sketchin' all the time
The result of this life in hell
But oh well, I think it's time
My faith is falling like the leaves from a tree
The pockets both take it away
The sun warms my body as I'm
Sittin' on a swing watching
Columbus clouds bring in the rain
Oh well I think it's time
It's time to go
My mind is playing tricks on me all the time
To let you know that I am real
And all the worries you build
Up inside your soul
The ones that make your world stand still
Mean you can feel that it's time to go
Are you fed up? Are you fed up with me?
Do you think you could do better?
Do you think that I know better?
Do they think that they know better?
Five fed up faces with the itch to kill a king
Blood red sunshine and a breath to air that's clean
I drink from the faucet
From the porch I take a pee
I look at you through the bushes
Where you can't see me
I laugh and slip into another state of mind
To let you know that I am real
And all the worries you build up inside your soul
The ones that make your world stand still
Means you can feel that it's time to go
When it's time to go
