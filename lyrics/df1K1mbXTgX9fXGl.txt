It's a beautiful life, oh oh
I just wanna be here, beside you
And stay until the break of dawn

Take a walk in the park when you feel down
There's so many things there that's gonna lift you up
See the nature in bloom, a laughing child
Such a dream, oh

And stay until the break of dawn

You're looking for somewhere to belong
You're standing all alone
For someone to guide you on your way
Now and forever

It's a beautiful life, oh oh
It's a beautiful life, oh oh
I just wanna be anybody

It's a beautiful life, oh oh

We're living in different ways

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

It's a beautiful life

It's a beautiful life
I'm gonna take you to a place
I've never been before, oh yeah

It's a beautiful life
I'm gonna take you in my arms
And fly away with you tonight

It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
