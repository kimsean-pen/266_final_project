No one can tell me
That I'm pretending
Why should I play games?
Love's not a play thing

Questions people ask of me
For loving you
Why should I say the reasons on my own?

No one has wanted more than I want you
No on has needed more than I do
No one has wanted mroe than I want you
No one has needed more than i love you

No I'm not dreaming
Love has a meaning
You're all I live for
No one can give more

Questions people ask of me
For loving you
Why should I say the reasons on my own?

No one has wanted more than I want you
No on has needed more than I do
No one has wanted mroe than I want you
No one has needed more than i love you

(Ad Libs)

No one has wanted more than I want you
No on has needed more than I do
No one has wanted more than I want you
No one has needed more than i love you

(Repeat Till End)
