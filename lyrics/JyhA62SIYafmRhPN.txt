Martini

I'm at a road to ruin, I don't know what I'm doin', Martini
I guess this is the place, inside I see your face, Martini
I walk into the room, position I assume, Martini (One second)
You put a record on, I hear my favourite song, Martini
(Yep)

I need us to march, right here, right now, oh-oh, Martini
I need us to imagine that like wow, oh-oh, Martini
I need us to march, right here, right now, oh-oh, Martini
I need us to imagine that like wow, oh-oh, Martini (Right)

Movin' like I'm wildfire, burnin' for some action, Martini
So let me be the actor paid that's bound to happen, Martini
(Cut)

I need us to march, right here, right now, oh-oh, Martini
I need us to imagine that like wow, oh-oh, Martini
I need us to march, right here, right now, oh-oh, Martini
I need us to imagine that like wow, oh-oh, Martini

It's cool, stayin' live for us
'Cause who's goin' to shine for us?
Ooh, that's bad for us

I need us to march, right here, right now, oh-oh, Martini
I need us to imagine that like wow, oh-oh, Martini
I need us to march, right here, right now, oh-oh, Martini
I need us to imagine that like wow, oh-oh, Martini
