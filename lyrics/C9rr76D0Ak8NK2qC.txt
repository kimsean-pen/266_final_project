i used to think i was leaves but i'm bark
and i'm peeling away
and my bones are the branches that re grow in the springtime
if there's one thing that i believe, it's that the wind can make you a child again.
if there's one thing that i believe, it's that the wind can make you a child again.
if there's one thing that i believe, it's that my body will be the same wherever i bleed
