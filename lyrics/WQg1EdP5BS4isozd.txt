Last night all my attention
squinting westward at the sunset
With a map and a compass
when a man reached up, said something
There ...
against the sky,
a point of light ...
Too ...
invisible...
to give itself to the naked eye
On the shore people yelling
in their eyes a great reflection
In the grid aware their position
unconcerned with intuition
There could never be
no sympathy
from
that wilderness so let it be arrested

Swing lo oh Magellan,
9 by 6 or 8 by 7
Post a sentinel at the border
of what you attempt
What you ignore
I saw my frame in a pool of light
All drown ...
in doubt and shame
and I knew that I
had lost my sight
