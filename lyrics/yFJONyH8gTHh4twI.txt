Years of breathing
this consuming
black sphere
that surrounds me
life in your future
exists not for me
all clouded
and unresolved
as I helplessly watch
the descending of
the final inner night
to see the self
disintegrate
all clouded
and unresolved
as I helplessly watch
the descending of
the final inner night
