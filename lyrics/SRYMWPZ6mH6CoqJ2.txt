Watch the incision on your very own children
On your television
In your own reflection
You deny the protection
Of your own infection
I can hear you calling me
I recognize your voice
Saying: don't look away, I won't look away, I won't look away
You watch the distribution
Of a mass confusion
Spread by the institution
Sell your inclusion
Of you and your own illusion
Instead of thinking you're the solution
I can hear you calling me
I recognize your voice
Saying: don't look away, I won't look away, I won't look away
If it's somebody else's problem
Somebody else's pain
If it's someone else's problem
Somebody else's pain
If it's someone else's problem
Somebody else's pain
I can hear you calling me
I recognize your voice
Saying: don't look away, I won't look away, I won't look away
I can hear you calling me
I recognize your voice
Saying: don't look away, I won't look away, I won't look away
