So do you know I'm a dancer now
With red painted lips, and a jezebel crown
So have you heard, I'm a singer now
With reliquary eyes, and a diadem frown

But I look for you
In the diamond trees
And the highway divine
Deliver me
Your father died
A month ago
And he scattered his ashes
In the snow

But oh my lonely diamond heart
It misses you so well
Oh my lonely diamond heart
It misses you oh well

I had a man in every town
And I thought of you each time
I tore off my gown
Changes have come
And I cannot recall
The shape of your face
Through the winters and falls

But I look for you
In the traffic seas
And the bars I'm always frequenting
Your father died
Some months ago
And we scattered his ashes
In the snow

Holidays are the hardest hours of the year
Holidays are the hardest hours of the year
Holidays are the hardest hours of the year

And oh my lonely diamond heart
It misses you my dear

She gave me a bird
Made out of clay
So I never will forget her
And he gave me a book
Made out of wood
To fasten all
The emblems
She gave me a bird
Made out of clay
So I never will forget her

But oh my lonely diamond heart
It misses you so well
And oh my lonely diamond heart
It misses you oh well
