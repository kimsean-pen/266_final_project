I remember all those nights I used to stay at home
On the phone, all night long
Used to talk about the things we really wanna do
I believed in you

I remember how you used to say
Have no fear, it'll be Okay
When you told me anything you want is possible
We could have it all

I believed in you,
Must have been a fool,
All my dreams were with you

I say, it's OK
I can promise you it's all right
You ain't keeping me up all night, no more
You're not here but

It's OK
I assure you babe it's all right
You ain't keeping me up all night, no more
You're not here but it's OK

Well now you got to where you wanted like I knew you would
Cash, car, house - it's all good
Is it why you never come around here, no more,
Like you did before

Got it all that's the way it seems
Blokes like you, live your dreams
And I hope you're loving tenderful and better now
When I'm not around

I believed in you,
Must have been a fool,
All my dreams were with you

I say, it's OK
I can promise you it's all right
You ain't keeping me up all night, no more
You're not here but

It's OK
I assure you babe it's all right
You ain't keeping me up all night, no more, no more
You're not here but it's OK

It's alright and it's OK and
It's alright and it's OK and
It's alright and it's OK and
(you're not here with me)
It's alright and it's OK and
It's alright and it's OK and
It's alright and it's OK and
(you're not here with me)

I say, it's OK
I can promise you it's all right
You ain't keeping me up all night, no more
You're not here but

It's OK
I assure you babe it's all right
You ain't keeping me up all night, no more, no more
You're not here but it's OK

It's alright and it's OK and
It's alright and it's OK and
It's alright and it's OK and
(you're not here with me)
It's alright and it's OK and
It's alright and it's OK and
It's alright and it's OK and

You're not here but it's OK
