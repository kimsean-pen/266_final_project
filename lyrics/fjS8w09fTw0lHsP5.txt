Would you really wanna make it alone if you could
Wanna wanna make you feel good
You feel it out but you don't quite know if you should
Wanna wanna make you feel good

It won't happen if I ain't happenin'
Oh why don't you make the call
I'm all peace and satisfaction
Oh no why don't you make the call

I like to go fast I like to go far
Won't you open that door get in my car
Don't have to be alone
Don't have to be hard
Won't you open that door get you into my car
Open up the door get you in that car

Only ever wanna get you alone if I should
Wanna wanna make you feel good
You fell in love but just in hollywood
Wanna wanna make you feel good

You bring caution I'll bring the action
Oh no why don't you make the call
I'm all talk and you're all attraction
Oh no no no you make the call

I like to go fast I like to go far
Won't you open that door get in my car
Don't have to be alone
Don't have to be hard
Won't you open that door get you into my car
Open up the door get you in that car

You get applause and all the attention
I'm gonna chase you down that hall
Hit the lights and give me permission
I'll get you down
You wet your lips and I wet your ambition
I'm gonna get when i get that call
You got your claws in a risky position
I'll get you down

I like to go fast I like to go far
Won't you open that door get in my car
Don't have to be alone
Don't have to be hard
Won't you open that door get you into my car
Open up the door get you in that car
