I remember the moment that my dreams were broken
I wrote them down on a post card then threw it away
I slipped into some trousers and rolled out my window
Then went out into the wilderness where I'm going to stay

And it's a long long long journey that we've been on
And it's a long long long story that can be told
And it's a long long day
We've come a long long way
And it's a long long long way back

I'm looking around this museum at paintings I relate to
Even though most of them were painted by somebody else
Then we went to the movies and watched lots of films there, yeah
Now I'm going down to hollywood to make them myself

And it's a long long long journey that we've been on
And it's a long long long story that will be told
And it's a long long day
We've come a long long way
And it's a long long long way back
And it's a big big vehicle that we're driving in
And I've been following this roadway since it began
And if I came here to lose then i still might win
When I go down that road again

And the road doesn't end
It's a long long road and we follow it again and again
And the road don't pretend
I went down to the coast guard to see what they're guarding
See what the sign says, you idiot, we're guarding the coast
Now I'm going on a podcast to talk about my memories
Even though I can't remember anything from before the show

I made some long long phone calls to my friends at home
And I told them where I've been and the places I'm going
And they said wow that's incredible but we already know
Because of that long long song you wrote
About how
It's a long long long journey that we've been on
And it's a long long long story that shall be told
And it's a long long day
We've come a long long way
But there's still a long way to go
And it's a long long long way
It's a long long strong way
It's a long long long way
Forward
