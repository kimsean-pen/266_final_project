All my life i've been fall- fall- falling apart,
Been tumbling down quick first right from the start
I never learned just get up and go on
Until I'm just knocked right off of my feet

But it's not the fall that hurts
It's when you hit the ground
Cuz it's not the fall that hurts
It's when you hit the ground

Stumblin' with every step I take
And it seems I can't get a grip
I'm soon gonna slip
And then I look down
I see the fur ground
Is closening fast again
And then boom

But it's not the fall that hurts
It's when you hit the ground
Cuz it's not the fall that hurts
It's when you hit the ground
