Everyday is so wonderful
And suddenly, it's hard to breathe
Now and then, I get insecure
From all the pain,
I'm so ashamed

Everyday is so wonderful
And suddenly, it's hard to breathe
Now and then, I get insecure
From all the pain,
I'm so ashamed

(You are what you are...)
You are beautiful no matter what they say
(No matter what they say)
(No matter what they say, No matter what they)
(You are what you are...)
We are beautiful no matter what they say
(No matter what they say)
(No matter what they say, No matter what they)

To all your friends you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness,
Pieces gone,
Left undone

(You are what you are...)
You are beautiful no matter what they say
(No matter what they say)
(No matter what they say, No matter what they)
(You are what you are...)
We are beautiful no matter what they say
(No matter what they say)
(No matter what they say, No matter what they)

No matter what we do
No matter what we say
We're the song inside the tune
Full of beautiful mistakes
And everywhere we go
The sun will always shine
But tomorrow we might awake
On the other side
And everywhere we go
The sun will always shine
