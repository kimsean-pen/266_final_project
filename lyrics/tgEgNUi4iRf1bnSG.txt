You can climb a mountain
You can swim the sea
You can jump into the fire
But you'll never be free

You can shake me up
Or I can break you down
Whoa
Whoa

We can make each other happy
Oh, we can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
Oh, we can make each other happy

You can climb a mountain
You can swim the sea
You can jump into the fire
But you'll never be free

You can shake me up
Or I can break you down
Whoa
Whoa

We can make each other happy
Oh, we can make each other happy
Oh, we can make each other happy
We can make each other happy

You can climb a mountain
You can swim the sea
You can jump into the fire
But you'll never be free, oh no

You can shake me up
Or I can break you down
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
