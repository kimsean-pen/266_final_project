No, I'm not a liar
Just didn't know how to tell you the truth
All we need is time
We don't know why we do what we do, what we do

On a night like this
Just don't know what I'm trying to prove
No, we can't predict
The reasons why we do what we do
But we do, but we do
Yeah we do, what we do
Yeah we do, what we do
Yeah we do, what we do

When you fall in love
You can't help it when you act like a fool
When you look above
You see the reasons why we do what we do
What we do, what we do
Yeah we do, what we do
Yeah we do, what we do
Yeah we do, what we do

Ain't got a shot glass in my fist
Just spilling away all my business
Telling these strangers about you
I'm getting too, I'm getting too
I'm getting too oh, oh
Personal
I'm getting too personal
I'm getting too personal
Personal, personal
With you

Now I'm wondering
They can tell that I've been crying all night
'Cause I told myself
I don't love you, though I know it's a lie
'Cause I do
When you fall in love
You can't help it when you act like a fool
When you look above
You see the reasons why we do what we do

Ain't got a shot glass in my fist
Just spilling away all my business
Telling these strangers about you
I'm getting too, I'm getting too
I'm getting too oh, oh
Personal
I'm getting too personal
I'm getting too personal
Personal, personal
With you

Hear me up, hear me out right now, hey
Hear me out, hear me out now, hey
You've been running through my mind all-day
Hear me out now, hear me baby
Hear me up, hear me out right now, hey
Hear me out, hear me out now, hey
You've been running through my mind all-day
Hear me out now, hear me baby

Shot glass in my fist
Just spilling away all my business
Telling these strangers about you
I'm getting too, I'm getting too
I'm getting too oh, oh
Personal
I'm getting too personal
I'm getting too personal
Personal, personal
With you
Ooh, ooh

You've been running through my mind all-day, oooh
Hear me out now, hear me baby
