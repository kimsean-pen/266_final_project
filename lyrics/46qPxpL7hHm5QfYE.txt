Won't you go back to where you go
I want you to forever know
These guys have all got problems
These guys have all got their problems

Today, you've come now go away
I know it gets so confusing
Sometimes it all seems to drag me down
Then when I'm getting closer, so close
Everything just falls apart

When will you stop and see me through
There's something else I'd rather do
Although you're getting angry
I know everyone gets a star

Today, you've come now go away
I know it gets so confusing
Sometimes it all seems to drag me down
Then when I'm getting closer, so close
Everything just falls apart
