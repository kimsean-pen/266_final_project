'da' is Russian for 'yes'

Bang, say da da da da
Tell me yes and let's feed the fire
Bang bang, say da da da
Nothin' less, I wanna hear a yes
Bang, say da da da da
Tell me yes and let's feed the fire
Bang bang, say da da da
Tell me yes

The word is out, got good news
We're gonna go for a midnight cruise
Steady weather, it's always cool
The street teaches what you learn at school
Look out, the gang's all here
Gettin' tough in tender years
Come for a ride,
Straight up to heaven
Your rocket is ready
And it started counting down

Give it in or give it out
We can blow it up
Or we can blow it all out
Get a little or get a lot
It doesn't matter we'll never stop
So wild, young and free
Red hot and sugar sweet
Come for a ride straight up to heaven
Your rocket is ready
And it started counting down
