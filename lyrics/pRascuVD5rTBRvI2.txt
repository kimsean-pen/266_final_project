So they say you're a troubled boy
Just because you like to destroy
All the things that bring the idiots joy
Well, what's wrong with a little destruction?

And the Kunst won't talk to you
'Cause you kissed St. Rollox Adieu
'Cause you robbed a supermarket or two
Well, who gives a damn about the profits of Tesco?

Did I see you in a limousine
Flinging out the fish and the unleavened
Turn the rich into wine
Walk on the mean
The fallen are the virtuous among us
Walk among us

Never judge us
Yeah we're all...
Up now and get 'em, boy
Up now and get 'em, boy

Drink to the devil
Death to the doctors!
Did I see you in a limousine
Flinging out the fish and the unleavened
Five thousand users fed today

Oh as you feed us
Won't you lead us
To be blessed
So we stole and drank champagne

On the seventh seal you said you never feel pain
"I never feel pain, won't you hit me again?"
"I need a bit of black and blue to be a rotation"
In my blood I felt the bubbles burst

There was a flash of fist, an eyebrow burst
You've a lazy laugh and a red white shirt
I fall to the floor fainting at the sight of blood
Did I see you in a limousine
Flinging out the fish and the unleavened
You turn the rich into wine
Walk on the mean
Be the Magdalene or virgin you've already been

You've already been already seen
That the fallen are the virtuous among us
Walk among us
Never judge us

To be blessed
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la...
So I'm sorry if I ever resisted
I never had a doubt you ever existed

I only have a problem when people insist on
Taking their hate and placing it on your name
So they say you're a troubled boy
Just because you like to destroy
You are the word, the word is 'destroy'
I break this bottle, think of you fondly
Did I see you in a limousine
Flinging out the fish and the unleavened
To the whore in a hostel

Or the scum of a scheme
Turn the rich into wine

Walk on the mean
It's not a jag in the arm
It's a nail in the beam
On this barren Earth
You scatter your seed
Be the Magdelene of virgin
You've already been
And you've already seen.
Woohoo! woohoo! woohoo! woohoo! woohoo! woohoo! woohoo! woohoo!
Yeah! You've already been
You've already seen
That the fallen are the virtuous among us
Walk among us
If you judge us
We're all damned.
