Yeah, I was not a man, just a little kid
But I've met you and I've lost all my innocence
You convinced me that I was wrong
Look at yourself, this is a wake up call
This is a wake up call
Oh!
I can't breath from the deepest of my lungs
You convinced me that I was wrong
Thanks to you now I am twice as strong
Tell me why, tell me why, you didn't understand who I am, who I am
I confess I had sins but I tried to fight the best I can
Please take me home, take me home, please take me home
Please take me home since you forgot
You've never trust me, am I not enough
I'm not leaving you, well I guess there's something wrong
You were hiding the truth
You played with my heart
You trampled my youth
We were caught in an endless circle
I won't be your guide, I won't be the guy you asked for
Everything in here is spinning around
I'm drowning again but I'm still
hearing the sound of your fucking lies
Please take me home since you forgot
You've never trusted me, am I not enough
I'm not leaving you, well I guess there's something wrong
It was cold and it never felt like home
I can't breath from the deepest of my lungs
I can't breath from
Uh!
You're a lost cause
