Yeah
Uh, huh
La, da, da, da, da

Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
Hey, baby my nose is getting big
I noticed it be growing when I been telling them fibs
Now you say your trust's getting weaker
Probably 'cause my lies just started getting deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learn my lesson
And I really think you have to know the truth

Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after I did it I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I have been a little immature
Fucking with your heart like I was the predator
In my book of lies I was the editor, and the author
I forged my signature
And now I apologize for what I did to ya
'Cause what you did to me, I did to you

No, no, no, no baby
No, no, no, no don't lie
Cause no, no, no, no yeah
Know, know, know, know you gotta try

What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I see you and what you're all about
No, no, no, no baby
No, no, no, no don't lie
Know, know, know, know you gotta try

She said I'm leaving
'Cause she can't take the pain
It's hard to continue this love it ain't the same
Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain
Too many lies committed too many games

She feeling like a fool getting on the last train
Tryin' to maintain but the feeling won't change
I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane
Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame
I don't know the reason why I did these things

And I lie, and I lie
And I lie, and I lie

And now our emotions are drained
Cause I lie and, I lie and a little lie, lie
And now your emotions are drained

No, no, no, no baby
No, no, no, no don't lie
'Cause no, no, no, no yeah
Know, know, know, know you gotta try

What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I see you and what you're all about
No, no, no, no baby
No, no, no, no don't lie
Know, know, know, know you gotta try

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ba da, ba da, ba ba ba ba, ba da da, ba da da, ba da da, ba da da

Yo, I'm lying to my girl
Even though I love her
And she all in my world
I give her all my attention and diamonds and pearls
She's the one who makes me feel on top of the world
Still I lie to my girl, I do it

And I lie, and I lie, and I lie 'til there's no turning back
I don't know why, and I lie, and I lie 'til I don't know who I am

No, no, no, no baby
No, no, no, no don't lie
Cause no, no, no, no yeah
Know, know, know, know you gotta try

What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I see you and what you're all about
No, no, no, no baby
No, no, no, no don't lie
Know, know, know, know you gotta try
