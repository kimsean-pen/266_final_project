She is smiling like heaven is down on earth
The sun is shining so bright on her
And all her wishes have finally come true
And her heart is weeping.
This happiness is killing her

It's true she's in love

She'll be right here in my arms
So in love
She'll be right here in these arms
She can't let go

She'll be right here in my arms
So in love
She'll be right here in these arms
She can't let go

So hard she's trying
But her heart won't turn to stone... oh no
She keeps on crying
But I won't leave her alone
She'll never be alone

She'll be right here in my arms
So in love
She'll be right here in these arms
She can't let go

She'll be right here in my arms
So in love
She'll be right here in these arms
She can't let go

And she'll be right here in my arms
So in love
She'll be right here in these arms
She can't let go
