One...
Two...
One, two, three, four!

Sometimes I think...
Things are overwhelming!
Sometimes I think...
I don't know what I'll do!
But I forget the world
And everything around me
That's what I think...
When I think about you!

The streets are filled
With too many babies
Black air in a sky of blue

People pass by
No life in their eyes
The concrete jungle's
Really going crazy!

Sometimes I think...
Things are overwhelming!
Sometimes I think...
I don't know what I'll do!
But I forget the world
And everything around me
That's what I think
When I think about you!

That's what I think
When I think about you!

The rent is due and
The pockets are empty
People ask machines for the truth!

No crystal ball
Can help see it all
But where we gonna find
The dreams to feed the babies?

Baby, life goes on!
That's what people say
But I'm nowhere If you go away!
I'd just be looking for a brighter day!

(I think about you!)
(I think of you!)
(Listen to me, baby!)
(That's... what I think... when I think about you!)

Come on!
Come on!
Hey! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

Sometimes I think...
Things are overwhelming!
Sometimes I think - But I...
I don't know what I'll do!
But I forget the world
And everything around me
That's what I think
When I think about you, yeah!

I... think about you!
I... think about you!
Oh, when you're not there
Forget about the world
And everything around me
That's what I think
When I think about you! Yeah!

Come on!
Come on!
I wanna say Oh! Ohhhh!
When I think about you!
Ah, come on now!
Listen to me, baby!
That's what I think
When I think about you!

Come on!
Come on!
Oh, baby, I think about you!
Oh! Hey! Listen to me, baby!
That's what I think
When I think about you!

Oh, yeah!

But sometimes I think
I don't know what I'll do!
But I forget the world
And everything around me
That's what I think
When I think about you!
