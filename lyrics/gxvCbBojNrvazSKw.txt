"Close the door," he says, "this will ony take a minute."

But sometimes minutes can get caught in suspension

"I finally figured it out, and you're that someone who knows a little more than somethingabout me."

He says, "I met this firl out in Palm Spirng... Man, she's the best! You'd be so happy for me!"

And it hits me hard seein this blue eyed dream sprouting wings and flying away from me

Flying away from me... yeahh
What if I say you love me?
Could I make it true? We could build us something that would mean something to you Cause when i close my eyes, I'm in this world where you don't have a girl
and I'm right by your side
Say you love me
It don't mean that I'll ever have you
ohhh... no

do we'r driving home
I look out at the rain on the roads out my passendger window
It's been one ofthose nights, it all feels so alive
Man, you bet, I'm gonna hate sayin goodbye

He pulls up on my driveay
says, "See you on Friday"
If he only knew what I'd do to be
THe rain on his coat, those keys that he holds
Or the one he has waiting back home

What if I say you love me?
Could I make it true? We could build us something that would mean something to you Cause when i close my eyes, I'm in this world where you don't have a girl
and I'm right by your side
Say you love me
It don't mean that I'll ever have you
ohhh... no

I'm not gonna lie
A stubborn part of me keeps the hope alive
That someday I'll be yours and you'll
be mine
And I know you'llnever understand
So to keep from losing my best friend I
hold it all inside

Say you love me...
We could build us something...

What if I say you love me?
Could I make it true? We could build us something that would mean something to you Cause when i close my eyes, I'm in this world where you don't have a girl
and I'm right by your side
Say you love me
It don't mean that I'll ever have you
ohhh... no
