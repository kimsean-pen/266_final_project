You can dog on me all you want
Do me dirty, I ain't never, ever worry
Get the cheddar like I'm Vermont
I be learnin' on my motherfuckin' journey
Don't believe me? All good, just watch
Do me dirty, I ain't never, ever worry
Soon, you'll wanna be on my squad
On God

You're doin' the most hoping that I forget I'm dope
And sing the wrong notes on a song about you that I just wrote
It's really a trip, in the time you're hating, you could get rich
And be a bad bitch, don't slip when you step on my drip

Pay no mind 'cause I'm on my grind
Keep my eyes on the sky, stay fly, leave you behind
Pay no mind 'cause I'm on my grind
Keep my eyes on the sky, stay fly, leave you behind

You can dog on me all you want
Do me dirty, I ain't never, ever worry
Get the cheddar like I'm Vermont
I be learnin' on my motherfuckin' journey
Don't believe me? All good, just watch
Do me dirty, I ain't never, ever worry
Soon, you'll wanna be on my squad
On God

Can't even be mad (Can't be mad)
If you talk about me behind my back (Behind my back)
Stay grateful and laugh
Since I left your ass, I been so relaxed (Relaxed)
No need to pretend (Don't pretend)
That a toxic hoe could ever be my friend (Be my friend)
No need to impress someone threatened by my success

On my grind so I pay no mind
Keep my eyes on the sky, stay fly, leave you behind
On my grind so I pay no mind
Keep my eyes on the sky, stay fly, leave you behind

You can dog on me all you want (Ooh)
Do me dirty, I ain't never, ever worry (No)
Get the cheddar like I'm Vermont
I be learnin' on my motherfuckin' journey (On my journey)
Don't believe me? All good, just watch (Ooh, oh)
Do me dirty, I ain't never, ever worry (I ain't ever worried)
Soon, you'll wanna be on my squad (Yeah)
On God
