Repentless
Unholy martyr
To save this world
Hybrid utopia
My dream will perish nevermore
It's a blessing of malice and gore

War cries! Hell horn!
Carnage of souls

Taste my reward
This will be your downfall

Behold its rising
A God is born
Black wings unfolding
Repentless I condemn you all
Raping the mind of the whore

War cries! Hell horn!
Carnage of souls
Taste my reward

This will be your downfall
Legions of doom
Morbid and cruel
This day will bring
One dream, one king to die for

The hour is calling
For my new realm
Nightmares now beat the drum for
Eternal hell

War cries! Hell horn!
Carnage of souls
Taste my reward
This will be your downfall
Legions of doom
Morbid and cruel
This day will bring
One dream, one king to die for
