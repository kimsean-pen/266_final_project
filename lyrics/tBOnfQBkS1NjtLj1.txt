Sounds so great, everything you're saying
Do lies out loud change anything?
Go get mad
Have a child's tantrum
'Til everyone knows how wronged you've been

Look around, that's not me
Not one shred of who I'll be
You don't know what I do
The one way getting out is through

Damn, there's no practical advantage
To chase that love from people hurting you
See all kinds once you think they need it
The ones who'll take it, then the ones who know the truth

Look around, that's not me
Not one shred of who I'll be
You don't know what I do
The one way getting out is through

Slow things down, baby check your motives
You sleep at night and stand up straight
Keep in mind, there's a big, big difference
To letting go and running away

Look around, that's not me
Not one shred of who I'll be
You don't know what I do
The one way getting out is through
