I want more than you can give
I'm so cold with every kiss
I can cope with a love like this

I let go, but I cling
To a love I've never seen
Give me faith
It feels like I just opened the doors
I steal, all thought
Nothing ever comes for free
This world is watching me
This world is watching me

It drains the blood from me
It pains my skin so deep
Now all that's left is all I need

This world is watching me
This world is watching me

This world is watching me
This world is watching me
