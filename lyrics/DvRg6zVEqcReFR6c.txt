I guess I never found the right time, did I?
To tell you i'm sorry I gave up,
But until you're broken
You don't know what you're made of

There's a part of me that you'll never know
A filthy lie that I'm keeping close
Cuts at the skin and it's sinking in
How deep it goes
And there's a piece of you that i'll never see
Between the lines and found underneath
Of these calloused eyes, yours and mine
But it never shows

I was a broken wreck, lost in noise
Pulled me out and I found my voice
You told me once and I won't forget
You don't pull a punch, the fly south effect
And i'll face it down, not like you
The only way out is a way through
So put a hand up if you've had enough
And it's time to choose

I guess I never found the right time did I
To tell you i'm sorry i gave up
But until you're broken
You don't know what you're made of

I feel my heart caving in
This line i'm walking is paper thin
And it's hard to hide the scar beneath the skin
Cause i've been burned and broke
And I wanted out, but i'm better now
And I know I won't be giving in

Yeah, I can't help the way that I sound
Or the fact you're not around
But you told me once before you left
How to live my life out loud
You can hide in the dark, but they'll never know you
Or speak your mind and they'll never own you
It won't bring you back or the time we had
But I hope it shows you
It goes

We've been waiting
We've been waiting
We've been waiting
(You don't know what you're made of)
We've been waiting

Yeah, go!
From the top of the world
I can see where the sky breaks
Until you're lost in the dark
You don't look for the way

I guess I never found the right time, did I?
To tell you i'm sorry I gave up,
But until you're broken
You don't know what you're made of

I guess I never found the right time, did I?
To tell you i'm sorry I gave up,
But until you're broken
You don't know what you're made of

We've been waiting
(You don't know what you're made of)
We've been waiting
(You don't know what you're made of)
We've been waiting
