There's a still in the street outside your window
You're keeping secrets on your pillow
Let me inside: no cause for alarm
I promise tonight not to do no harm
I promise you babe I won't do you no harm
And we're caught up in the crossfire
Of heaven and hell
And we're searching for shelter
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Watching your dress as you turn down the light
I forget all about the storm outside
Dark clouds roll their way over town
Heartache and pain came a-pouring down like
Hail sleet and rain yeah, they're handing it out
And we're caught up in the crossfire
Of heaven and hell
And we're searching for shelter
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
And tell the devil that he can go back from where came
His firey arrows drew their beat in vain
And when the hardest part is over we'll be here
And our dreams will break the boundaries of our fear
The boundaries of our fear
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Next to mine
