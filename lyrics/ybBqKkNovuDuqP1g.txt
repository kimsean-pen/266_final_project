Give me that, I need that
Give me that, boom-bara-bara-bara-boom-bang
I need that, boom-bara-bara-bara-boom-bang

I'm a broken back, I am on the ground
I'm a victim down, I'm a heart in wrecks
Got me feeling low and I let it show
Give me that, boom-bara-bara-bara-boom-bang
I need that, boom-bara-bara-bara-boom-bang
Yes, I'm a broken back
I'm on the ground, victim down
Hear me, I need some more
'Cause my body started shaking and I thirst for more

Low me one more time
Calling my addiction, baby
You're my crime

I need a loving that keeps me high tonight, tonight, yeah
You are the only one who can make it right, right
Give me that, boom-bara-bara-bara-boom-bang
I need that, boom-bara-bara-bara-boom-bang
I need a loving that keeps me high tonight

Give me that, boom-bara-bara-bara-boom-bang

Yeah, you told me words, they were healing me
Now they're binding me, try to shake it off
I'm on the ground, I'm a victim down
Give me that, boom-bara-bara-bara-boom-bang
I need that, boom-bara-bara-bara-boom-bang

Low me one more time
Calling my addiction baby
You're my crime

I need a loving that keeps me high tonight, tonight, yeah
You are the only one who can make it right, right
Give me that, boom-bara-bara-bara-boom-bang
I need that, boom-bara-bara-bara-boom-bang
I need a loving that keeps me high tonight
I need a, boom-boom-bara-bang

Give me that

I'm broken back
I am on the ground

I need a loving that keeps me high tonight, tonight, yeah
You are the only one who can make it right, right
Give me that, boom-bara-bara-bara-boom-bang
