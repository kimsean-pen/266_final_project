When I try I force it out
Never looking in only out
Now is the time for millions to lose
Never the same since I lost you
Running me out of town
Wishing the best around
Would only get you off my back
Heaven receives you and throws you back

Sending a dummy to my God
Sending a dummy to my God
Sending a dummy to my God
Sending a dummy to my God

Driving to eat a Carvel cake
Somewhere you know isn't where you think

Have you gone away

Have you gone, have you gone away already?
Come back, come back, come back, come back
Have you gone, have you gone away already?
Come back, come back, come back, come back
Have you gone have you gone away already?
Come back, come back, come back, come back
Have you gone, have you gone away already?
Come back, come back, come back, come back

All the good times are on their way

Up and down and that's how energy stays alive
Up and down and that's how energy stays alive
And I wouldn't have it any other way
Wouldn't have it any other way
