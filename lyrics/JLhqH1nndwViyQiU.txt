Standards come in doubles
That goes on forever
How could she be loyal
When she love me for my sweater
Dedicated cheat
Maybe I'm just spoiled
Clucking in my coupe
Birds is clapping like anoya
Cake!

Took her on a double date
Girl you know it ain't your birthday
But you throwing me the cake (Throwing me the cake)
Too much sauce up on my plate
I be floating in that foreign
I finesse for my filet (Throwing me the cake)
Took her on a double date
Girl you know it ain't your birthday
But you throwing me the cake (Throwing me the cake)
Too much sauce up on my plate
I be floating in that foreign
I finesse for my filet (Throwing me the cake)

Double cup gon' hold me up
I pray that I don't spill
Chopper on my partner
You know he be trained to kill
Pull up to the club with 20 racks in dollar bills
She go down the pole
Glamboy paying all her bills
She gone make some shake
Money she gone rake
Balling like McGrady
Finessing every play
Pull up to the Ace
Order up the Spades
Pull out in the Range
She sliding to my place (Throwing me the cake)
Piece together my whole night
Goddamn, that shit was real
Throwing all these bands
Molly rock all in my pill
Shawty focused, gonna get it
Finna make a couple mill
She be twerking on a nigga
Like he about to sign a deal

Standards come in doubles
That goes on forever
How could she be loyal
When she love me for my sweater
Dedicated cheat
Maybe I'm just spoiled
Clucking in my coupe
Birds is clapping like anoya
Cake!

Took her on a double date
Girl you know it ain't your birthday
But you throwing me the cake (Throwing me the cake)
Too much sauce up on my plate
I be floating in that foreign
I finesse for my filet (Throwing me the cake)

Story of my life and how I got it
I'm not being ignorant I'm just popping
Story up we know its not exotic
Story up my nigga how about it?
I don't bring no sand to the beach
I fall in love when I'm rolling off a bean
I'm from the streets, but your man industry
You mad at me 'cause your man isn't me
Yea my soul done turned to black
This the second Audi that I crashed
The concept of your ass I try to grasp
I'm just keep on swiping 'til its maxed
(Throwing me the cake)
