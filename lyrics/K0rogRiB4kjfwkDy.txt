Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singing his song

Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee
Every little bird in the tall oak tree

The wise old owl, the big black crow
Flappin' their wings singing go bird go

A pretty little raven at the bird-band stand
Taught him how to do the bop, it was grand

They started going steady and bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole
He rocks in the tree top all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singing his song

Well, a pretty little raven at the bird-band stand
Taught him how to do the bop, it was grand

They started going steady and bless my soul
He out-bopped the Buzzard and the Oriole
He rocks in the tree top all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singing his song
