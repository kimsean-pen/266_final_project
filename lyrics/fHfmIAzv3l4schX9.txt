Those roads that stretch ahead of us
The roads that led us here
Singing traditional renditions of the songs we sang last year
And though these times have made us stronger
The outcome's no more clear

Calling old friends to make sure they're real
Talking, talking just to feel
That sense of home you lost when you left last year
Distance is just numbers on a dashboard
Hours thinking about nothing but the transmission stutter you fear

I remember what you whispered in my ear
And all the things we tried so hard to never have to hear
Like "Kids tighten up, start saving for the golden years"
Well, hey, that picture it fades day by day
And the outcome's not so clear

Don't think I'll see you around this winter
And my tongue's stuck full of splinters
'Cause I'm embarrassed to admit what I've been thinking
Well, hope keeps some afloat, but for me it's no life boat
The tighter I hold on the deeper down I'm sinking

Tried to put my finger on it but gave it my whole arm
Reached out with good intention
But it only did more harm
Find ourselves alone since the day we're born
And we seek someone to sew sutures in the places where we're torn
