I thought surely I would not find it again
How I was wrong
It is as fateful as sin
The feeling that I belong to something in some way til the end
And I am making an effort to stay with you here
It has been easy to say that I would never lose sight of what my heart truly is
But the moment you step away I am forced to look in and face all the things that I have ever been without you
It is true at times one can see I am strong
I am not at home, yet I know where I belong
I am silence now, but I am always song
Can you hear me?

I thought this time last year I'd be dead
It's quite strange the thoughts that pop into your head
When you're busy smiling surrounded by your closest of friends
It is impossible to escape the sound of the dark that is following around
But I just go for a walk and the light can be found
And the moment I step away
You are forced to look in and face
All the things that you have ever been without me
It is true at times one can see you are strong
You are not at home, yet you know where you belong
You are silence now, but you are always song
I can hear you
