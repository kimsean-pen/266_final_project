By the sea I wandered on
Seeking some relief
On a soothing april dawn
Was when this came to be

By the sea I lingered on
When I became aware of
Distant voices from beyond
So dim and alluring

Riddles of the deep
Secrets of the deep blue sea
Tragedienne, in sorrow eternally

Mesmerized and shivering
I came to understand
There's something about the sea
The grave for a thousand men

Riddles of the deep
Secrets of the deep blue sea
Tragedienne, in sorrow eternally

Riddles of the deep
Secrets of the deep blue sea
Tragedienne, in sorrow eternally
Tragedienne, in sorrow eternally
