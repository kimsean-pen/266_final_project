When I saw you I would lose control
Made me feel like there was no tomorrow
Should've told you that you're beautiful
But the days pass and now it's so long ago

Did you make it?
Did you break free?
Did you manage to be who you wanna be?
Maybe somewhere you think about me too

I wonder where are you now
Wonder where are you now
Now
Wonder where are you now
Would you know my name?
Would you know it and did you feel the same?
Wonder where are you now
Wonder where are you now

It's to late now because I'm growing old
But I need you to deal with my sorrow
Just a memory
Just a broken frame
And I know that I have no one else to blame

Did you make it?
Did you break free?
Did you manage to be who you wanna be?
Maybe somewhere you think about me too

I wonder where are you now
Wonder where are you now
Now
Wonder where are you now
Would you know my name?
Would you know it and did you feel the same?
Wonder where are you now
Wonder where are you now

Where are you now?
I wonder
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Should have told you that you're beautiful

I wonder where are you now
Wonder where are you now
Now
Wonder where are you now
Would you know my name?
Would you know it and did you feel the same?
Wonder where are you now
Wonder where are you now
