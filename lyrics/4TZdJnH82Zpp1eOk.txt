As dark night embraces
We are the nation

I will cleanse all your thoughts
We will cleanse them all
Now, my children
For the sake of our nation
Let us carry on
In glory
When dark night embraces
We are the nation

Be my fellow men
We will wipe them out
Let there be light
For the sake of our nation
Precious and bright

When dark night embraces
My mind
A twisted plan
After all
Despite all burden

Life has grown
And though the curse is still alive
File 664
The golden age's vanished and more
The ingenious knight knows it's over

He no longer denies there's a real me
He'll be disgraced
Burnt and sealed
They may end
As we will rule the world

Defeat the dying old Crow
Let this fire burn
Sail on till you reach the promised land
We all drown in the fifth dimension
The ninth wave
I can feel it's coming

The ninth wave
Sail on till you reach the promised land
We all wait for a new tomorrow
We'll bring a new age
Along with the final wave
The final wave
We will rise

Burn them all, bring the damned

There's a price to pay
Burn them all, bring the damned
Do as I command
Our praise and triumph will grow

We'll defy the Nine
Delete the dying old Crow
To Muriel's fire, walk with me
Down to the Abaddon

Will you walk with me to the Sheol?
Good or bad we all meet the Abaddon
Take a look and you see it's all the same
Imaginations
Exterminate them
Imaginations
Exterminate them
An evil revelation
A wicked thought
Denied by their savior
They all prayed for
Salvation
There are no gods
So no one can save them
Until
They will redeem Belial
They will unite them all
Then many men will fall
When they wil heed the call
So they'll be free

Before the final curtain falls
Belial
Bring the cursed
Bring the damned
As we will rule the world

They'll seek the dying old Crow
Let this fire burn
Sail on till you reach the promised land
We all drown in the fifth dimension
The ninth wave
I can feel it's coming

The ninth wave

Sail on till you reach the promised land
We all wait for a new tomorrow
We'll bring a new age
Reborn as aeon gods

As aeon gods
We'll break through
Further down you'll walk with me
Down to seal Avalon

Will you walk with me to the fire?
Further down we come to seal Avalon
Take a look and you see it's all the same
Imaginations
Determination
Imaginations

Determination
There is no real salvation
We will wipe them out

And nothing remains here
As we don't need salvation
We will not fade
Forever we'll stay here
Screams come from the inside
The king is gone, but
This war is not over
Burnt and sealed they may end
As we will rule the world
Delete the dying old Crow
Let this fire burn
Sail on till you reach the promised land
We all drown in the fifth dimension
The ninth wave
I can feel it's coming
The ninth wave
Sail on till you reach the promised land
We all wait for a new tomorrow
We'll bring a new age
Reborn as aeon gods
As aeon gods
We'll break through
