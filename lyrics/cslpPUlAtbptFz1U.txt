One night
One more chance to say I'm sorry
And I can't believe a lie
Say you need me

One night
One more chance to say I'm sorry
And I can't believe a lie
Say you need me

Wave the white flag
I surrender, I surrender, I surrender
Wave the white flag
I surrender, I surrender, I surrender
I surrender

One night

One more chance to say I'm sorry
And I can't believe a lie

Say you need me

One night
One more chance to say I'm sorry
And I can't believe a lie
Say you need me

Wave the white flag
I surrender, I surrender, I surrender
Wave the white flag
I surrender, I surrender, I surrender
I surrender
One night
One more chance to say I'm sorry
One night
One more chance to say I'm sorry
And I can't believe a lie
Say you need me
