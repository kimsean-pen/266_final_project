Look what the other got
Shot reverse shot
Look what the other got

Drop the anchor make it stop, edible digital clocks
Infinity figure eight, figure out what you're not
Junk-an a po, cut your loss, come to cut your corners off
You're the rock and I'm the paper, you're the scissors, I'm the rock

Look what the other got
Shot reverse shot
Look what the other got

Feel this storm go through my sail, follow someone else's trail
Camera A, Camera B, in your home, on your TV
Look me up, look in my eyes, dilate, do I surprise you?
Watch me blush, blink, sink, trust in me so you don't have to think

Shot reverse shot
Look what the other got
Shot reverse shot
Look what the other got
Can you even feel what's real?
With such a shallow depth of field
Kill the engine, stop the car, cut the lights and there you are
Stars so small, you're the king of them all

Stand tall, rack focus, now you crawl back broken
Now the stars so vast, heat, wind, storm, break my mast

Feel this storm go through my sail
Follow someone else's trail
Can you even feel what's real?
With such a shallow depth of field
Shot reverse shot
Drop the anchor, make it stop, make the moment, kill the clock
Infinity figure eight, figure out what you're not
Junk-an a po, cut your loss, come to cut your corners off
You're the rock and I'm the paper, you're the scissors, I'm the rock
