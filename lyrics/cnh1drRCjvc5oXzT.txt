Seek & destroy all you have
'Cos I know
From free of fears and my tears
'Cos you know

And all I have now
Is being here with you

Seek & destroy all you have
'Cos I know
('Cos I know know right now)
They will never be tuning in
(Cover your fear)
To what we know

And all I have now
Is being here with you

Cover your fear it's all we know
Cover your fear it's all we know

'Cos all I have now
Is being here with you
'Cos all I have now
Is being here with you
