Broke another mirror with the back of my hand
Can't look at myself and I just don't understand
I'd be the first to tell you I'm a bad, dead man
Watch your memories fade and melt away in the sand
One, two, three, four
I drink 'til I hit the floor, smoke weed 'til I can't think no more
I have become numb
I sleep 'til I see the moon, gonna say what up to see my grandma soon
I have become numb
Numb
Numb
Numb
On the fire escape looking over the edge
This voice in my head is my only real friend
Hey you, Superman, you won't break your hand
One wisper away from a beautiful end
One, two, three, four
I drink 'til I hit the floor, smoke weed 'til I can't think no more
I have become numb
I sleep 'til I see the moon, gonna say what up to see my grandma soon
I have become numb
Numb
Numb
Numb
I drink 'til I hit the floor, smoke weed 'til I can't think no more
I have become numb
I sleep 'til I see the moon, gonna say what up to see my grandma soon
I have become numb
Numb
Numb
Numb
