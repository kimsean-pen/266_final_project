You find yourself trapped in self doubt
Wondering if you'll come out alive
You'll find millions of people trying to dim you out
But baby you still shine if you try
So much more inside your head
Overcome, everything and everyone in your way

Draw the map and lose your way
The answers come from your mistakes
Don't let the failure keep you down
You've got to fall to figure out
That only you can change
Your mind and your life

You're wondering just how you will make it out
When everything seems unfair
Oh no no no no, you've got to let that go
The pressure to be, the image you see
Stop living your life through a screen
You're suppose to feel incomplete
That's how they sell a dream
Can't you see the power to be
The master of your destiny
(Be the one to)

Draw the map and lose your way
The answers come from your mistakes
Don't lrt the failure keep you down
You've got to fall to figure out
That only you can change
Your mind and your life

Let the sun shine in the back of your mind
Where it rains all day and keeps you up all night
You've gotta believe in what you want
You gotta put faith in who you are
Do you believe in your self worth?
You've gotta make this work

Draw the map and lose your way
The answers come from your mistakes
Don't let the failure keep you down
You've got to fall to figure out
That only you can change
Your mind and your life
