Sistar so come closer, come closer, come closer
Why don't you come closer, don't worry just come closer
So come closer, come closer, come closer

I girui kkeuchi eodinji urido molla geuge eonjeilji molla
But i'm not give it up, people say sistar turn it up

Balgeoreumi danneun daero eodideun gallae geuge eodiinji mollado
So let's get down down sing along with us

We'll come to you nae moksoriga gakkapge deullil su itge come closer
We'll come to you so come closer, come closer, come closer

Translation

SISTAR So come closer, come closer, come closer
Why don't you come closer, don't worry just come closer
So come closer, come closer, come closer

We don't know where this road ends
We don't know when that will be
But I'm not give it up, people say SISTAR turn it up

Wherever my feet touches, I will go
Though I don't know where that is
So let's get down down sing along with us
We'll come to you, so you can hear my voice closer, come closer
We'll come to you So come closer, come closer, come closer
