If I told you, if I told you
If I told you something
You better, you better
Better not start running
I want you, yeah, I want you
I want you more than
It's cool to say
Guess no one can save me now
Do what you do to me
Rip it off, make it sting
I've got the guts
To get messed up
On your love
It's okay if it hurts
That's how I know you really meant it
Do what you do to me
Rip it off, make it sting

Boy you're dangerous
Yeah you're dangerous
I'mma call you tiger
Can you feel it, you feel it
No this shit ain't minor
The thing is, the thing is
I would kinda die to
Love you anyway
Guess no one can save me now
Do what you do to me
Rip it off, make it sting
I've got the guts
To get messed up
On your love
It's okay if it hurts
That's how I know you really meant it
Do what you do to me
Rip it off, make it sting

You could wreck me
Wouldn't that be amazing?
I'd let you wreck me
Wouldn't that be amazing?
Do what you do to me
Rip it off, make it sting
I've got the guts
To get messed up
On your love
It's okay if it hurts
That's how I know you really meant it
Do what you do to me
Rip it off, make it sting
Make it sting
