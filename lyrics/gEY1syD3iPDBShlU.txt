The warmest night, I ever felt
I spent with you
You
The fireflies, they multiply
Escape from view
View

You say you don't know me
You don't say
But could you ever see me
That way
You say you don't know now
That's okay
If you're the rock

I'm the ricochet
I'm the ricochet
If you're the rock
I'm the ricochet

The coldest night, I ever felt
I spent with you
You
The fire died
Our hearts were pried, they split in two

You say you don't love me
I'm too plain
You could never see me
That way
You say you don't know now
That's okay
If I'm the rock

You're the ricochet
You're the ricochet
If I'm the rock
You're my ricochet

Never want to hurt you
Want to hurt you
Never want to hurt you
Want to hurt you
Never want to hurt you
Want to bring you pain

Never want to hurt you
Want to hurt you
Never want to hurt you
Want to hurt you
Never want to hurt you
Want to bring you pain

You're the ricochet
You're the ricochet
If I'm the rock
You're my ricochet

You're the ricochet
You're the ricochet
If I'm the rock
You're my ricochet
