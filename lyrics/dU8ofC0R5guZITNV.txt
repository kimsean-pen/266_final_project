Oh we're further than before
And it's harder than it used to be
When I wanna see you
'Cause I need to
'Cause I feel like it
'Cause I want to
It gets the better of me

You don't know how hard
It is to bare
Getting on without you
Without you I'm not getting anywhere

'Cause every time that I see you
I can't help but think
That you're a little more distant now
Than you were with me last week
When I just wanna get closer
A little closer to you
Get as close as I can
So close that I can't breathe unless you do

Get a bit closer, close to you
Get a bit closer, closer, closer, ah ah
Get a bit closer, close to you
Get a bit closer, closer, closer

I close my eyes
I close my eyes
And I pray
Hoping that you
Have got what it takes
But I'm a fool to think you might wait

'Cause every time that I see you
I can't help but think
That you're a little more distant now
Than you were with me last week
When I just wanna get closer
A little closer to you
Get as close as I can
So close that I can't breathe unless you do

Get a bit closer, close to you
Get a bit closer, closer, closer, ah ah
Get a bit closer, close to you
Get a bit closer, closer, closer

But you're choosing Stockholm
You're choosing New York
You touch down in Sydney everywhere that I'm not
We're going the distance
But how can't you see
All this resistance
Ain't coming from me

'Cause every time that I see you
I can't help but think
That you're a little more distant now
Than you were with me last week
When I just wanna get closer
A little closer to you
Get as close as I can
So close that I can't breathe unless you do
Unless you do, unless you do
So close that I can't breathe unless you do
Get a bit closer, closer to you
Get a bit closer
