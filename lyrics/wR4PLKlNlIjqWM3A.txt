missing all my friends
losing touch
maybe i loved you but yr too much
will i see you again
yr prominent
i'm serious
there's confidence

hoping showing confidence is going to make you stay
and every time you talk, well i love everything you say
everything we try to start there's something in the way
i'll pass it off

well it costs dollars to write this song
for gas money and a ride home
well i've thought it through and i'm better now
for such a long time
step down

knowing that yr so close only hangs me up again
suffice to say the price i pay won't matter in the end
this is something i can't even talk about with friends
i'll pass it off

i've never been awake before the some comes up
well i could never worry about you enough
everything i say is obvious
i'm nothing good
i'm death to us

well i get caught up in these routines
the time i get home
the way i seem
and these songs i write
they aren't me
i'm terrible
i'm inbetween
