All I can see.
.no matter how"d you never go
And this is all that I can say,
No matter how you all felt
all the same
No matter how far

Only when nothing is wrong
Only when nothing is wrong
and the day we get done
Always time to complain that we once had

And it's all I can say,
no matter what you never know
And it's all King Kong
No matter what you never know
it's all the same
No matter how far

Only when nothing is wrong
Only when nothing is wrong and the day we got done
Always time to complain what you once had

So lose for nothing,
I give what you never get
it's all the same
No matter how hard you try
I'll leave you what you never know
, it's all the same
AND I AM DONE

Only when nothing's wrong
Only when nothing's wrong and the day we get done
Always time to complain what you once had
