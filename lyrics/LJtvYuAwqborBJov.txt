In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again?
For now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind

(Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind)

Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

(It's me they hear...)

My spirit and my voice
In one, combined
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my (your) mind

((Beware, the Phantom of the Opera))
Is there, the Phantom of the Opera

Ahhh. (Sing my angle)
Ahhh. (Sing my angle)
Ahhh. (Sing for me)
Ahhh. (Sing)
Ahhh. (Sing my angle)
Ahhh. (Sing for me)
Ahhh.

(I have brought you
To the scene of sweet music's throne
To this kingdom where all must pay homage to music
Music...)

(You have come here
For one purpose and one alone
Since the moment I first heard you sing
I have needed you with me to serve me, to sing
For my music
My music...)
