Scrape it, grind it, peel it, hide it
The trend is over and gone forever
Shelf it, box it, save it, frame it
You won't need that anymore, it's on sale at the dollar store
Waste of time, pantomime, circus doll, at the local mall

Exterminate, it's all fake
Exterminate, it's all fake

Sandblast yourself
Sandblast yourself

Sandblast
Sandblast

It's getting old, old, old
