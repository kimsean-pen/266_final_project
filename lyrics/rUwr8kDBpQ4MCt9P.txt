Don't worry 'cause I'll always be there for you
In the Heavens above

I just needed you to comfort me
And I have tried to make it right
And I don't know that I feel so sure
But I think that we missed out
So I've sung this song for you
And I just want you to say to me

Don't worry 'cause I'll always be there for you
In the Heavens above
Don't worry 'cause I'll always be there for you
In the Heavens above

Don't worry 'cause I'll always be there for you
Always be there

And all I wanted was to stand alone
So is there a place, that we could meet
And you see this face within your face and I
Stayed away but I'm back to hear you say

Don't worry 'cause I'll always be there for you
In the Heavens above
Don't worry 'cause I'll always be there for you
In the Heavens above

Don't worry 'cause I'll always be there for you
Always be there
In the Heavens above

Can you hear me
Through the spaces
Wondering in this wonderland
And if I try to understand
This broken man, broken man

Don't worry 'cause I'll always be there for you
In the Heavens above
Broken man
Don't worry 'cause I'll always be there for you
Always be there
Broken man

In the Heavens, in the Heavens
In the Heavens, for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
