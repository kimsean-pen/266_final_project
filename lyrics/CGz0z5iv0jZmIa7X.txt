Drop me off right here
I can go no further
It seems life's too hard for you
How come I feel like hanging around to win
When it seems you always lose
When you're stuck in the middle
With rejections again
It's time to call your reject friends
And meet me at the bottom of the wishing well range
And talk about an hour of change

And it seems so bad
Yeah, it so bad
Can we rescue ourselves from the former lives we had?

Is it too late?
Is it game over?
Will it get better?
It's better or will it

'Cause
Willy don't got an eye
Willy don't got an eye
He lost it on the Fourth of July
He don't got an eye
Willy don't got an eye
Willy don't got an eye
Things will never be the same 'cause
Willy's on his way

Don't throw sparklers or shoot them through the air
'Cause you never know when it's coming down
Breathtaking Soccer
Can be such a shocker
So try to get away somehow
When all you got is your bike
But Bike Rides are dumb
You gotta take a look inside
And find the secrets to life
Are down at the bottom
Of the underground waterslide

And it seems so bad
Yeah, it so bad
Can we rescue ourselves from the former lives we had?

Is it too late?
Is it game over?
Will it get better?
It's better or will it

'Cause
Willy don't got an eye
Willy don't got an eye
He lost it on the Fourth of July
He don't got an eye
Willy don't got an eye
Willy don't got an eye
Things will never be the same 'cause
Willy's on his way

Can we remember what we've got
Before we open our big mouths
To complain about the things we cannot change?
Instead of always asking why
At least you've got your two good eyes
We could try to find our zone
Or just sit and cry alone

Willy don't got an eye
Willy don't got an eye
He lost it on the Fourth of July
Now he don't got an eye
So don't cry,
Baby!
