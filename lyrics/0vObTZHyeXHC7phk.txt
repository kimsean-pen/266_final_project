I know we can make it, baby,
If only we tried.
Let's hang on to love
And don't let it die.
Even though...

It's been touch and go,
Off and on,
Weak and strong.
But then we didn't know
That with hope we could cope.
With all the ups and downs.
So please stay around.
I need you so.

I'd give you a bed of rose
Right here in my arms.
But you've got to take
The sweet with the thorns
And I know...

It's been touch and go,
Off and on,
Weak and strong.
But then we didn't know
That with hope, we could cope
With all the ups and downs
So please stay around.
I need you so.

Baby, touch and go,
Off and on,
Weak and strong.
But then we didn't know
That with hope, we could cope
With all the ups and downs.
So please stay around.
I need you so.

Oh, baby, now, touch and go,
Off and on,
Weak and strong.
But then we didn't know
That with hope, we could cope
With all the ups and downs.
So please stay around.
