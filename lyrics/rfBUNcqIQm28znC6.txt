Discovered far too late that
I must have made you up
And lost the fabric that
I think I made you of
The thoughts that could preserve you fly away
And now they're gone I see you

Changing
Fading
Disintegrating
Making
A better man than me has thrown the dice
A staff to part the sea
A place in life

Be home a little later
God's a croupier
I'll toast the liberator
And quit while I'm ahead
I heard the shadows speak from Plato's cave
That's when I knew that I was

Changing
Fading
Disintegrating
Making a better man of me
A better life
Not a fantasy
I've thrown the dice
