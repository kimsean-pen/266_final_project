Beneath the glowing of the moon,
The Luciferian torch... is sparked,
Upon the blackened Altar,
Blackest Flames twist... and burn.

As the black candles shimmer,
I gaze in to the... flickering flame,
The black flame of the abyss,
Let it embrace... your Soul.

Power of transformation,
I bear the mark... 666,
By what was spoken,
Shall soon... be reaped.

My devotion strengthens,
Like the fire... around my Temple,
Eating away the lies of Christ,
The tree of Knowledge... grows.

The fire all consuming,
The burning flame... of Dawn,
Ancient Fire of Creation,
The greatest gift... to Man,
Unlocking the gateways,
The hidden gateways... inside the gateways
Dark secrets hidden for centuries,
I am the true adversary... Hail Satan.
