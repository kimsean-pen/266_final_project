You'll never be alone again
You'll never die again
You'll never be born again
You'll forever be stuck here in eternity
(Waa ooo)

I bid you, welcome to my world
They call me existence
You have just entered through the gate
To your journey towards eternity

This part I control
(Control, control)
This part I control
(Control, control)

In the beginning you'll feel nothing
(As I climb beside you)
Time will be your master
In this laborious part of human subsistence

This part I control
(Control, control)

Black clouds embraces your soul
Slowly passing through
Repeating lacunas of anguish
When time takes your life

I will transfer you into the bare grip of thinking tranquility
Voices frilling the emptiness of the dead floating
(Seamless across the surface into chilling stillness)
(Nothing can help you now)
Nothing
Nothing can help you now

You'll never be alone again
You'll never die again
You'll never be born again
You'll forever be stuck here in eternity
