Let's buy the sky, fantasize, never compromise
Dipped in silver and gold, never satisfied
You're in the front row, you're so low
You don't know, I know

Black and blue, faces run down the paper
Talking tongues, light it up, you're a solider
You're so restless, you're so reckless
It's so relentless, I know

You want faster horses, you want faster horses
You want faster horses, you want faster, faster
Faster, faster, faster, faster
Faster, faster, faster, faster

You see me super flat, no opinion
Phase me out, I'm out, subterranean
You're in the front row, you're solo
You don't know, I know

Lick the bit, lick the glass, crack the window
Crack the whip, twist the cap, screw your face up
You're so restless, you're so reckless
It's so relentless, I know

You want faster horses, you want faster horses
You want faster horses, you want faster horses
You want faster horses, you want faster horses
You want faster horses, you want faster, faster

You want faster horses, you want faster horses
You want faster horses, you want faster, faster
You want faster horses, you want faster horses
You want faster horses, you want faster, faster
