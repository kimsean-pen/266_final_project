I hear the static drawing nearer, there's no way out
I breathe the ice and let the fire die

They keep on feeling me the chemicals I need to breathe
But how could something so important not belong to me?
I can't pretend like I'm the one who's going to change this
But all I know is that our time is running out

I get so tired lighting fires when I know we still have so much further left we could go

So how much longer must I wait to fill this emptiness
I make mistakes and had my dreams slip through the cracks
I've seen such hate surround the inside of this dark abyss
But all this pain just makes me certain that there's love for me to find a brighter paths

And out of the dust I see the light creep in and I know it won't be long
But I'm still terrified, cuz at least in the dark no one else can see who you really are
So bring me the sound of your guns and blame me for all of your wrongs
It seems hate is all I have left
Yeah it's all I have left, it's the only thing that's left in me

I get so tired lighting fires when I know we still have so much further effort to go

So how much longer must I wait to fill this emptiness
I make mistakes and had my dreams slip through the cracks
I've seen such hate surround the inside of this dark abyss
But all this pain just makes me certain that there's love for me to find a brighter paths

So when you feel like you're falling under
Holding on to the things you thought you loved
Will you let all the things you've run from
Chew you up and spit you out?
This all ends now!

I get so tired lighting fires when I know we still have so much further left we could go
I get so tired lighting fires when I know we still have so much further left we could go

So how much longer must I wait to fill this emptiness
I make mistakes and had my dreams slip through the cracks
I've seen such hate surround the inside of this dark abyss
But all this pain just makes me certain that there's love for me to find a brighter paths

Find a brighter paths
Don't be scared, we'll see the lights go out
