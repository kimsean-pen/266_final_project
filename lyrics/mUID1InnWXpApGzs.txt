Galswintha of the Visigoths
Promised the King of Newstria
Love him until the day of death
What did she know
What a man was he

Galswintha sleeping all alone
Life in the hands of Fredegund
Jealousy blowing up her wits
She put an end to the princess' life

Mercy there is no mercy within anger
Darkness there's only darkness in your blindness

Burning you will be burning
For your cruelty

Envious eyes mistress of cruelty

Angel a dark angel in her chamber
Fearless a maiden fearless as she strangles
Burning you will be burning for your cruelty
Envious eye mistress of cruelty
