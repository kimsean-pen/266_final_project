I'm alone sitting with my empty glass
My four walls follow me through my past
I was on a Paris train I emerged in London rain
And you were waiting there swimming through apologies

I remember searching for the perfect words
I was hoping you might change your mind
I remember a soldier sleeping next to me
Riding on the metro

You wore white smiling as you took my hand
So removed we spoke of wintertime in France
Minutes passed with shallow words
Years have passed and still the hurt
I can see you now smiling as I pulled away

I remember the letter wrinkled in my hand
"I'll love you always" filled my eyes
I remember a night we walked along the Seine
Riding on the metro

I remember a feeling coming over me
The soldier turned, then looked away
I remember hating you for loving me
Riding on the metro

I'm alone sitting with my broken glass
My four walls follow me through my past
I was on a Paris train I emerged in London rain
And you were waiting there swimming through apologies - sorry
I remember searching for the perfect words
I was hoping you might change your mind
I remember a soldier sleeping next to me
Riding on the metro
