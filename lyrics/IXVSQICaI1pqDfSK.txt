I'll drink the moonlight from your hands
I'll swim an ocean filled with sorrow
No lover, please don't go
We can crucify tomorrow

Let the sunlight feed the air
Let it fill our lungs with lies
We'll be memorized by shadows
But our loneliness will survive

Now the sugar in your soft voice
Makes the sweetness in your weeping
And the black rose that you swallowed
Feeds the solitude you're dreaming

No, I'll never taste your tears again
In the darkness that we're breathing in
Now the sun will kill the garden
In a universe that is bleeding
