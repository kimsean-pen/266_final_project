How's it stand?
What are we, left in sand?
Flush my cheeks
Wear me out
Keep me clean
Keep me longing
Keep the quiet company
Wear me out
I heard a voice telling me
Like your smoke waving
And my eyes repine
Wear me out
That wick won't burn away
It's giving uneven
Wear me out
Like a sistant heart in absence
Like a sister who's finally had it
Like a room left open
Just for being kept like some lonely facet
Like the promise of a place in nowhere
You're neither here nor there
Wear me out
And the tree tos
Like crooked beliefs
The crosshatch crow's feet
Reaching for the Baltimore heat
And I repine
Faster and faster
Faster and faster now
Faster and faster
faster and faster
Your wick won't burn away
Your wick won't burn away
Your wick won't burn away
Your wick won't burn away
And what are we without regrets?
What are we?
Wear me out
And what are we without that end;
Without that death and darkness?
Wear me out
There's so many parallels from then to now
We tried to believe we can turn it ourselves
It's a flaw that can't be faked
I heard a voice passing through
And I know it's never you
And I know what I'm looking to find
And I repine
Faster and faster
Faster and faster now
Faster and faster
Faster and faster
Your wick won't burn away
Your wick won't burn away
Your wick won't burn away
Your wick won't burn away
