Every day you can see the sun
But its light makes your eyes weep
Every night you come into the club
And I always feel what you need

You wanna touch me
You wanna touch me now
You wanna touch me
When the music plays around
You wanna touch me more
You wanna touch me
And it takes higher and higher
You can touch me now
You wanna touch me
When the music is loud
You wanna touch me
You can touch me more
You wanna touch me
And it takes higher and higher

You wanna touch me
You wanna touch me
You wanna touch me
And it takes higher and higher
Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Higher and higher

Every day you can see the sky
When the clouds out this all we need
But at night you can back to your desires
And again I feel what you need
I feel what you need
You wanna touch me
You can touch me now
You wanna touch me
When the music is loud
You wanna touch me
You can touch me more
You wanna touch me
And it takes higher and higher
I feel what you need
You wanna touch me
I feel what you need
You wanna touch me
I feel what you need
You wanna touch me
And it takes higher and higher
I feel what you need
I feel what you need
I feel what you need
I feel what you need
I feel what you need

You wanna touch me
You wanna touch me
You wanna touch me
And it takes higher and higher
Higher and higher
I feel what you need
Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Higher and higher
I feel what you need
Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Higher and higher

I feel what you need
