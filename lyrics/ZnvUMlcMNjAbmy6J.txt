Yeah, yeah, yeah

I heard lately, you ain't been the same
You're always saying, you ain't playin' games
Before you go too far, I need to get my hands untied
Pull myself together, I won't listen to your lies

Mystified, mystified, heard it on the grapevine
Lover on the other line, why you wasting my time?
I'm mystified, mystified, you're such a dirty man
Heard it on the grapevine, lover on the other line
I'm mystified, yeah, yeah, yeah

I heard you say, you were working so late
Stealin' baby, there's some things that can't wait
Don't you need to hold on tight, that isn't my perfume
So where did you end up last night, remind me, I'm confused

Mystified, mystified, heard it on the grapevine
Lover on the other line, why you wasting my time?
I'm mystified, mystified, you're such a dirty man
Heard it on the grapevine, lover on the other line
I'm mystified, yeah, yeah, yeah
