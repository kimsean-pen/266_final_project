I know you need a friend someone you can talk to who will understand what you're going through
When it comes to love there's no easy answer only you can say what you're gonna do
I heard you on the phone you took his number said you were alone that you will call him soon
Isn't he the guy the guy who left you crying?
Isn't he the one who made you blue... ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...?
When you remember those nights in his arms you know you got to make up your mind
Are you gonna stay with the one who loves you or are you going back to the one you love?
Someone's gonna cry when they know they lost you
Someone's gonna thank the stars above
What you gonna say when he comes over
There's no easy way to see this through
All the broken dreams all the disappointment
Oh girl... whatcha gonna do?
Your heart keeps sayin it's just not fair but still you gotta make up your mind
Are you gonna stay with the one who loves you or are you going back to the you love?
Someone's gonna cry when they know they lost you
Someone's gonna thank the stars above
