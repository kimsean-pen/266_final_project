What u believe
is the vanity u conceive
What u love u don't pen
to put in a cage is to put to an end

Enamoured of the passion
life-sucking lust
u will never gain my trust

I'm a misanthropical breed
insatiable in my need to feed

Utterly fearless
for your luscious flesh
I've got am appetite like a war
and I always hunger for more

Enamoured of the passion
life-sucking lust
u will never gain my trust

I'm a misanthropical breed
insatiable in my need to feed

Vicious mammal
the blood is my call
pound for pound
I am the most vicious of all
