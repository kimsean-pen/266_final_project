Frank D. Fixer was a handyman
He could handle anything
He was my granddad
He grew his own food
And he could fix his own car
I watched it all happen
In our backyard

He'd re-invent the part to fix a broken home
He'd restore the heart

Well, I wish I was a fixer
I would fix you up inside
I would build you a town if the world fell down
I wish I was that guy

Well, if Frank D. Fixer were alive today
Well, he might laugh at me
Or he may have a lot to say
He might ask that I keep working for the family
To keep the bills all paid
And be his protégé

What happened to the ground right where we are?
What happened to the family farm?

Well, I wish I was a fixer
I would fix you up inside
I would build you a town if the world fell down
I wish I was that guy

Every evening breaking bread
He showed us who a real man is
No matter what my grandma said
He would never lose his head

Well, I wish I was a fixer
I would fix you up inside
I would build you a town if the world fell down
I wish I was that guy
Well, I wish I was a farmer
I would grow you a Garden of Eden
And I would bless our family with the gifts
My granddad handed me
How wonderful that would be
Maybe I'll make that guy be me
