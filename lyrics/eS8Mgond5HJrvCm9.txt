Crawling in my skin
Without a sense of confidence (confidence, confidence, confidence)
Consuming confusing

Crawling in my skin
Without a sense of confidence (confidence, confidence, confidence)
I'm convinced that there just too much pressure to take
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface

Crawling in my skin (Crawling in my skin)
These wounds they will not heal
(These wounds they will not heal)
Fear is how I fall
(Fear is how I fall)
Confusing what is real
(Confusing what is real)

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming c, c, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never ending
Controlling I can't seem
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)

I've felt this way before
So insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure

(Without a sense of confidence)
(Without a sense of confidence)
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)
(Without a sense of confidence)
(Without a sense of confidence)
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real
