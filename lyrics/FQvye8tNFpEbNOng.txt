If I was a bird I could fly far, far, far away

My hands are shaking but there's nothing to fear
I'm wide awake with my ghost
Lay down beside me while I shut myself in
My tears keep rolling don't wanna feel this way no more

Rise up right now
Rise up right now
Rise up, I know you can get off the ground
Rise up right now
Rise up right now
Rise up, I know you can get off the ground

Stop a minute cause I'm so cold
If the river dries, my heart won't beat right anymore

Rise up right now
Rise up right now
Rise up, I know you can, get off the ground
Rise up right now
Rise up right now
Rise up, I know you can, get off the ground

You call when I'm breaking up
Leave me when the rivers rough
Say you're going to make it and stop pretending
Rise up way above it all
I don't need your love no more
Leave me when the rivers rough, stop pretending

Rise up, rise up, rise up
