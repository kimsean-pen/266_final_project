undisguised
you can't run from night
become an old ludite
to the banes of life
only for a momen t in your mind
you'll see in ultra violet
put your tears aside
for an oversight
made a heart collapse a
conceptual song
only for a moment in your life
you'll dream in ultra violet
keep your hands inside
the ride on my lips
intercept the moment in your eyelids
wander in your mind in deadly silence
don't let imperfections volunteer your virus
don't assume you'll die in incandescent light
you take all the fun in light
