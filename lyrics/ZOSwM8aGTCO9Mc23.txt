I've been thinking about you girl lately
It's hard to get you out of my mind
And the choice I made didn't come lightly
And I think that I'll regret this for the rest of my life
My baby please
Won't you come back to me
Oh, my baby please
Won't you run back to me
Oh, but baby please, please, please
Won't you come back
For the rest, the rest of my life
I've been trying to reach you girl daily
But I just can't get through to your line
And I would come knocking but I don't want to see who's replaced me
And I think that I'll regret this for the rest of my life
My baby please
Won't you come back to me
Oh, my baby please
Won't you run back to me
Oh, but baby please, please, please
Won't you come back
For the rest, the rest of my life
My baby please
Won't you come back to me
Oh, my baby please
Won't you run back to me
Oh, but baby please, please, please
Won't you come back
For the rest, the rest of my life
