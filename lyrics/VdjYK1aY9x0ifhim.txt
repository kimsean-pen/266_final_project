If you come close I'll tell you a little secret
The best ones you can learn from are your enemies
When it comes to know and defeat your weakness
You need to be the hunter and the prey

Remembering the days
We would be lying on the grass out in the sun
Felt good to be friend back then
But now we've built a fence of differences

Now please present me what I've lost
And I'll portray your failures
So that we can be complete

It's like a Magic Mirror
Colliding mind's reflection
They are the sacred window
Reveals the other side
So be the Magic Mirror
The other eye's Perception
They are the sacred window
Grant that light to shine

You and I know what's the best for both of us
Even though our thoughts are not the same
Living in worlds
That might be slightly different
Let us build a bridge, unite our ways!

Always remembering the days
We would be lying on the grass out in the sun

So, every time you point your fingers
You deny your own mistakes
Now who's the one to blame?

I see the Magic Mirror
Colliding mind's reflection
They are the sacred window
Reveals the other side
So be the Magic Mirror
The other eye's Perception
They are the sacred window
Grant that light to shine
