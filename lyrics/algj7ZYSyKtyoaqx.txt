Some people laugh in the dark
Some people cry alone
Some people talk without sayin' a thing
And ev'rything turns out gloomy

Some people count your money
Someone is countin' your days
And somebody got to keep track of your mind
When ev'rything turns out gloomy

Brothers'll make you look sideways
Fathers'll make you look back
And when you're done talkin', you still got to shoot
'Cause ev'rything turns out gloomy

Oo, oo-oo
Oo, oo-oo
