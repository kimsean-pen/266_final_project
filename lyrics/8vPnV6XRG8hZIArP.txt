Still living in his dad's house, 24 years old
He could buy a few pads, but he just like to stay home
No, he never took the fast route, not a [?]
But they still make him take the trash out, keep his ass in check

Same kids from the high school, jump shot still flame
Couple million in the back, but
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Nothing has changed, he is the same

His assistant is his best friend
Lost him [?]
Really puts it in perspective
What the fuck's a bad day?
Sister told him [?], 24 years old
Real women need love, fake bitches want gold

Same kids from the high school, jump shot still flame
Couple million in the back, but
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Nothing has changed, he is the same

All he needed was a platform, [?]
Took 'em with him when the deal came
Selling out every state
Signed a deal after his first tape
But he kept it on the low
They can never say he sold out
So why they come to every show?

Same kids from the high school, jump shot still flame
Couple million in the back, but
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Nothing has changed, he is the same
