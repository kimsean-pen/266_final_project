This is your country, this is your home
Here is the house where you grew up alone
This is your country, this is your home
Here is the house where you grew up alone

The city streets you used to love
Are bruised and broken, are black and blue
On our TV's, miles away
On our doorsteps with no reason why

Take it back, take it back, take it back
Take it back, take it back, take it back

This is your country, this is your home
Here is the house where you grew up alone
Remember this, remember this for what it was
Remember this, remember this for what it was
Remember this, remember this

Take it back, take it back, take it back
You want a voice but your voices sound like violence
You don't, you don't deserve this life
You don't, you don't deserve this

This is your country, this is your home
Here is the house where you grew up alone
Remember this, remember this for what it was

A bleak projection of absent minds
You want a voice but your voices sound like violence
You shout so loud, but all I hear is silence
The city streets that you show no love
Are bruised and broken because of you
Because of you
Because of you

This is your country, this is your home
Here is the house where you grew up alone
This is your country, this is your home
Here is the house where you grew up alone
Remember this, remember this for what it was
Remember this, remember this for what it was
For what it was
