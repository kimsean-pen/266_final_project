No more dreams to fulfill – in this life that holds still – I have lost the light in my life
Why can't I see – it was all a dream – have I lived in a lie – that I made myself

All the lies behind my smiles – they say that true love never dies... but you will...
All that we shared feels like a lie – I wish that I could turn back time – to the point when it all was fine

Let me be a part of this dream – all that we used to be
I am all alone – when it all falls apart – no one to catch when I fall
All the dreams have faded away – in a world where love has ceased to exist
Take my heart and let me die – just take my heart but let me die
