To put a fire out
Needed to pour, pour down
I'm watching with the lights out
I filled a life with you
I built my whole world
On the back of matchsticks
A bunch of flammable romantics

So all I do is
Burn
For you I
Burn

To put a fire out
Amongst a cold, cold war
Where I am just behind the glow
I cannot not love you, oh
In a new afternoon smokin'
To cloud up my emotions

Now all I do is
Burn
Burn

Caught in the fire
Smoke's in the air
You cover me in your fuel
I'm going nowhere
I'm drenched in desire
My heart is now combustible
But I'll be going nowhere

I'll burn

It rises to the top of my lungs
Burn
I'll stay here even when it hurts
Burn
This might just never stop if we just let 'em burn
Burn
I'll burn

Burn

Burn

Burn

Burn
