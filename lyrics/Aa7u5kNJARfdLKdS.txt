Oooo
I wanna walk to the edge of the earth
Scream your name
'Til the fire's gone
For my loss
I wanna drink til' I don't feel the urge
To run back to you and lay it down
Make me yours

I can still feel your breath all over me, feeling me
I could fuck with you for eternity, infinity
Turn all the lights on
I could be your lover
I could be the one for you and no one else at all

So how long will it be till you see how bad I need this
I'll give you all if you please, never leave I need to keep it
I could fuck with you for infinity

I wish I'd never touched no one before
I envy the hearts that you've adored
That you loved
Don't wanna fight so let's settle the score
Tear me apart
But don't let go

I can still feel your breath all over me, feeling me
I could fuck with you for eternity, infinity
Turn all the lights on
I could be your lover
I could be the one for you and no one else at all
So how long will it be till you see how bad I need this
I'll give you all if you please, never leave I need to keep it
I could fuck with you for infinity

Tell me that I'm crazy
Tell me I'm wrong
I will be your baby even when your gone
'Cause I don't wanna tell you that I don't feel you at all
I'll be standing here when your gone

I can still feel your breath all over me, feeling me
I could fuck with you for eternity, infinity
Turn all the lights on
I could be your lover
I could be the one for you and no one else at all

So how long will it be till you see how bad I need this
I'll give you all if you please, never leave I need to keep it
I could fuck with you for infinity

I could fuck with you for infinity

I could fuck with you for infinity
