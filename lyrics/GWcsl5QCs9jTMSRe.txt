So you say you've never been in love
That you don't even know what that means
You thought you did
but now that it's over you think
Can't even be half of the real thing

And as time goes on and on
I can feel my heart growing colder and colder
But then I see your face in the crowd
and think, how can it be starting over

'Cause when you meet someone new
It all just takes over you
And you think that you never really tried
Open your heart
Open your mind

Girl
You're gonna take me
back to a time
when I loved and I meant it
Girl
You're gonna save me
Give me a chance
It's worth taking
Girl
You're gonna take me
back to a time
when I loved and I meant it
Girl
You're gonna save me
Give me a chance
It's worth taking
Oh

And we always say the same old things
And we always use the same tired lines
Staying up all night
Talking it out
Ending up with no one on our side

And as time goes on and on
I can feel my heart growing colder and colder
But then I see your face in the crowd
and think, how can it be starting over

'Cause when you meet someone new
It all just takes over you
And you think that you never really tried
Open your heart
Open your mind

Girl
You're gonna take me
back to a time
when I loved and I meant it
Girl
You're gonna save me
Give me a chance
It's worth taking
Girl
You're gonna take me
back to a time
when I loved and I meant it
Girl
You're gonna save me
Give me a chance
It's worth taking
Oh
It's worth taking
Oh

'Cause when you meet someone new
It all just takes over you
And you think that you never really tried
And you think that you never really tried
And you think that you never really tried
Open your heart
Open your mind

Girl
You're gonna take me
back to a time
when I loved and I meant it
Girl
You're gonna save me
Give me a chance
It's worth taking
Girl
You're gonna take me
back to a time
when I loved and I meant it
Girl
You're gonna save me
Give me a chance
It's worth taking
Girl
You're gonna take me
back to a time
when I loved and I meant it
Girl
You're gonna save me
Give me a chance
It's worth taking
Girl
You're gonna take me
back to a time
when I loved and I meant it
Girl
You're gonna save me
Give me a chance
It's worth taking
Oh
