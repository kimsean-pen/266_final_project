Another day is here and I am still alive
I say these words aloud, they speak from the inside
And everytime I see you
You just walk away
Still the world is turning

I want to hear what you, what you've got to say
I want to hear what you, what you've got to say
I want to hear what you, what you've got to say
I want to hear what you, what you've got to say, ay, ay, ay, uh

My mind is all made up, I'm doing all I can
I'm trying hard to think, but I can't understand
Why everytime I see you
You just walk away
And still the world is turning
I will not complain

My head is spinning round, I don't know what to do
If I'm so happy, I've got everything to lose
And everytime I see you
I can't stand to stay
And now it's always raining
You're the one to blame

Everytime I see you
You just walk away
Still the world is turning

I want to hear what you, what you've got to say
I want to hear what you, what you've got to say
I want to hear what you, what you've got to say
I want to hear what you, what you've got to...
Say hey hey hey
