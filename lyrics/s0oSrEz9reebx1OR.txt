Your eyes follow like a spotlight
Two eyes like the sun
Go ahead, keep your distance from me
Soon you're gonna cum
When you flick your hair like you don't care
And you're asking where I'm from
That game that you're running baby
You've already won

I need to know, know, know
What do ya need, need, need?
What do ya like, like, like?
Because I'm going to be it tonight

You can be cool, you can be shy
Say what you want, say what you like
'Cause ooh, your body talks, your body talks
Ooh-ooh, your body talks
You could pretend you don't want it now
But I read the signs from your head to your toes
Yeah, you don't need to say a word 'cause
Ooh, ooh your body talks

Your lips are a conversation
That face is a song
If it's my imagination
Stop me if I'm wrong

I need to know, know, know
What do ya need, need, need?
What do ya like, like, like?
Because I'm going to be it tonight

You can be cool, you can be shy
Say what you want, say what you like
'Cause ooh, your body talks, your body talks
Ooh-ooh, your body talks
You could pretend you don't want it now
But I read the signs from your head to your toes
Yeah, you don't need to say a word 'cause
Ooh, ooh your body talks

Ooh ooh ooh ooh oh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh oh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh oh
Oooh
Ooh, your body talks, your body talks
Ooh, your body talks

You can be cool, you can be shy
Say what you want, say what you like
'Cause ooh your body talks, your body talks
Ooh, ooh, your body talks
You could pretend you don't want it now
But I read the signs from your head to your toes
'Cause you don't need to say a word 'cause
Ooh, ooh your body talks

Ooh ooh ooh ooh oh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh oh
(Talk to me)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh oh
(You don't wanna be shy)
Oooh

Shake your hips
(Ooh ooh)
It's on your lips
You don't need to say a word 'cause
Ooh-ooh, your body talks
