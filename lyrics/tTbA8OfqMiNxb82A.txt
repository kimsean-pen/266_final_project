An incision, sliced dry-
Release the prisions from the hell of your mind
Flood out, poisoning
Pestilence on every loved living thing
Cold snap, lonely breath
Binding tightly to whatever is left
Rattled cages, broken bones
A plague lit path to every road that you roam

Avengement, avengement
It will find you and eat you up alive
Avengement

Scrying mirror, holding weight-
Behold the glass will show the scenes of this fate
Every junction you may turn
Sent up in flames as I grin while you burn.

Avengement, avengement
It will find you and eat you up alive
Avengement
Should you ever see this face again
Run fast and far past every bend
