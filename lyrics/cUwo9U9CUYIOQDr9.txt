You're seeming so closed
I want to see your guard down
I want to know what's under there
I'm feeling so numb
So you can keep your clothes on, keep 'em on

Come on, honey, 'cause we got no time
Tell everybody you're no longer mine

And now you're gonna wanna run from me
Because I border on insanity
I'd pick another colour for the sky
But I'm really sorry, honey, there's no time

And now you run like hell
As fast and as far as you can
You ain't got no time on your hands

Are you gon' talk?
Cause something's wrong
Cause something's bothering your mind
You holding up?
Do you sleep at all?
Is something wrong?

Come on, honey, 'cause we got no time
Tell everybody you're no longer mine

Oh girl I'm honest yes you're gonna wanna run from me
Because I border on insanity
I'd pick another colour for the sky
But I'm really sorry, honey, there's no time
There's no time
