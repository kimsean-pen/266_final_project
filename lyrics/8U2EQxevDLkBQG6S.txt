Nothing ever comes like it did when you were in it
Just a memory of a kid, just a washed out finish
Just a pain-in-the-ass Johnny Cash middle finger
No shooting up drugs, no quitter is a winner

Nothing ever comes like it did when you were in it
Keeping nothing for yourself like a stone cold killer
Now you're passing your people like a ship in the night
Looking to every stranger for a fight

Nothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it
Choking like a dog, like a dog on a collar
Open up your mouth, your mouth if you want it
Listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down

Hoping that you like, that you like how you're living
Relying on the kindness of strangers that you will be forgiven
How many times, how many times will you shit on what you're given?
How many times, how many times 'til you shut up and listen?

Nothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it
Choking like a dog, like a dog on a collar
Open up your mouth, your mouth if you want it
Listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down

Nothing ever comes, ever comes
Choking like a dog, like a dog
Open up your mouth
Listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down

Nothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it
Choking like a dog, like a dog on a collar
Open up your mouth if you want it
Listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down
