Inhibitions, televisions
Clicking through whatever weather you know that you are mine
Let's you know I know better I want to see you tonight
'Cause the clocks count down and we are in for bad weather
It be nice to see you to see you nice
But I, I want to see you tonight

'Cause you're my top
You're my top, you are my top 100 shows
Why do I always have to go killing the joke?

Interstellar, dressed in leather, drinking bitter boy
You know the plan, but you never knew the ploy
But I, I live a lonely life
Since you've been gone,
I've left the TV on, let the milk go sour, let the bills pile up
But I, I know I'm a funny guy

'Cause you're my top
You're my top, you are my 100 shows
Why do I always have to go killing the joke?

Swear I saw you smile
You try to hide it well
3:15 and I'm on the wrong side Columbia street

'Cause you're my top
You're my top, you are my top 100 shows
Why do I always have to go killing the joke?

Kill the joke
Kill the joke
Kill the joke
Kill the joke
