Why would he?

Me sitting round cool with my dibby dibby girl
Police knock my door, lick up my pal
Rough me up and I can't do a thing
Pick up my line when my telephone ring
Take me to the station, black up my hands
Trail me down 'cause I'm hanging with the Snowman
What am I gonna do, I'm backed and I'm trapped

Slap me in my face, look all of my gap
They have no clues and they wanna get warmer
But Shan won't turn informer
