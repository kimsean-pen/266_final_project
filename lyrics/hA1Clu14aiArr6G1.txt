Shadows
Faded black
Lovers
Losing track
Bashful
We always hide our cracks
Youthful
'Cause we've never turned our backs

Just you and me (wish that I could see more, see more)
(Wish that I could see more, see more)
Just you and me (wish that I could see more, see more)
(Wish that I could see more, see more)
Just you and me

Bashful lovers, just you and me
We take it slow, just you and me
Falling backwards, just you and me
Sink so low, just you and me

Bashful lovers, just you and me
We take it slow, just you and me
Falling backwards, just you and me
Sink so low, just you and me

Blankets
Hold us tight
Whisper
Please take this right
'Cause we're bashful
We'll forever burn inside
Trust that
This is not goodbye

Just you and me (wish that I could see more, see more)
(Wish that I could see more, see more)
Just you and me (wish that I could see more, see more)
(Wish that I could see more, see more)
Just you and me

Bashful lovers, just you and me
We take it slow, just you and me
Falling backwards, just you and me
Sink so low, just you and me

Bashful lovers, just you and me
We take it slow, just you and me
Falling backwards, just you and me
Sink so low, just you and me

(Wish that I could see more, see more)
(Wish that I could see more, see more)
Just you and me (wish that I could see more, see more)
(Wish that I could see more, take me)
Just you and me (wish that I could see more, see more)
(Wish that I could see more, take me)
(Wish that I could see more, see more)
(Wish that I could see more, take me)
