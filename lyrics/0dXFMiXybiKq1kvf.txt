Jimmy's in the back with a pocket of high
If you listen close you can hear him cry
Oh, lord, heaven knows
We belong way down below, sing it
Oh, lord, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Way down below, way down below
Judy's in the front seat picking up trash
Living on the dough, gonna make that cash

Won't be pretty, won't be sweet
She's just sitting here on her feet singing
Oh, lord, heaven knows
We belong way down below, go
Oh, lord, heaven knows
We belong way down below, sing
Oh, lord, tell us so
We belong way down below
Oh, lord, tell us so
We belong way down below
Way down below, way down below, way down below, way down below
I've got better days, man
I've seen better days
I've got better ways, man
I know better ways
One, two, three and four
The devil's knocking at your door
Caught in the eye of a dead man's wife
Show you life with your head up high
Now you're on your knees with a head down low
Big man teels you where to go

Tell them it's good, tell them ok

Don't do a Goddamn thing they say

Oh, lord, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Oh, lord, tell us so
We belong way down below
Way down below, way down below, way down below, way down below
I've seen better ways, man
I know better ways
I've seen better days, man
I've got better days
Jenna's in the back with a pocket of high
If you listen close you can hear the crying
Oh, lord, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Oh, lord, tell us so
We belong way down below
Oh, lord, heaven knows
We belong way down below
Oh, lord, tell us so
We belong way down below
Way down below
