What!? C'mon! Go!
I stand alone, but I will not be broken.
I stand alone, for true words which I've spoken.
But I stand, I stand over this.
Where is my family. I am never so alone. Our vision never forgotten. I see clearly, you are not one of me.
I stand alone, but I will not be broken.
I stand alone, for true words which I've spoken.
I stand alone, but I will not be broken.
I stand alone, and now my dreams are slowly escaping.
I don't need anyone. I don't know you.

I will gladly change the world. Take my life.
I will gladly change the world. I hope you feel the same.
Move!

Go!

By my time, I'm gonna die, your gonna die.
No one cares, let them take me now, I'm already dead.
I don't need anyone. I don't know you.
?
What!? Come on!
I stand alone, x2
But I will not be broken.
I stand alone, x2
For true words which I've spoken.
