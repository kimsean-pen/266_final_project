I don't wanna be a ghost
I don't wanna be a ghost
In California
Near the coast
The sun it shines here
And I am blind here
Til now

For 22 years a ghost
22 years to lose my mind
Ship him out now
Like a boat
We are leaving
We are leaving you all

I don't wanna be a ghost
I don't wanna be a ghost
In California
Near the coast
The sun it shines here
And I am fine here
Til now
