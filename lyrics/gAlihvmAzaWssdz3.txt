Said baby you're the greatest
Of all time the greatest
So won't you hear me babe
You're still on my mind

Said I ain't seen your ass in a couple months
But if you want if baby you can get you some
If all that conflict, we could work out
So go ahead put this good in your mouth
What you about

Second time around
We can get it started like Black Eyed Peas in town
There's nothing to figure out, yeah

Said baby you're the greatest
Of all time the greatest
So won't you hear me babe
You're still on my mind

Said I ain't seen your ass in a couple months
But if you want if baby you can get you some
If all that conflict, we could work out
So go ahead, put this good in your mouth
What you about

Don't mean to impose
You sink into my body like we're Jack and Rose
Your friends don't have enough, yeah

Said baby you're the greatest
Of all time the greatest
So won't you hear me babe
You're still on my mind

You're the greatest
I said you are
I said you are
I said you are
I said you are
Don't you hear me babe
I said you are
I said you are
Hear me mind
