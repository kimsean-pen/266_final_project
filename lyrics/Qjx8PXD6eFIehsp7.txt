Sure as a circle
Just keeps coming round
Sure as we've reached
The speed of sound
Sure as the sun will rise
In the morning sky
We'll never say it, never say goodbye

Now I know it will be
A hundred percent certainty
I'm giving you more
You can be sure
A hundred percent
Je t'adore

Now I know it will be
A hundred percent certainty
I'm giving you more
You can be sure
A hundred percent

Just as there's beauty
In everyday things
There is joy universal
When the bird sings

As sure as there's changes
We will all stay the same
The immortal pose
Just pictures in a frame

Now I know it will be
A hundred percent certainty
I'm giving you more
You can be sure
A hundred percent
Je t'adore

Now I know it will be
A hundred percent certainty
I'm giving you more
You can be sure
A hundred percent
Je t'adore

Now I know it will be
A hundred percent certainty
I'm giving you more
You can be sure
A hundred percent
Je t'adore

Now I know it will be
A hundred percent certainty
I'm giving you more
You can be sure
A hundred percent
Je t'adore

Show me amore
Trust in every sign
So be gone the space between us
There's no doubt in heart and mind

Now I know it will be
A hundred percent certainty
I'm giving you more
You can be sure
A hundred percent
Je t'adore

Now I know it will be
A hundred percent certainty
I'm giving you more
You can be sure
A hundred percent
Je t'adore

Now I know it will be
A hundred percent certainty
I'm giving you more
You can be sure
A hundred percent
Je t'adore

Now I know it will be
A hundred percent certainty
I'm giving you more
You can be sure
A hundred percent

Sure as a circle
Just keeps coming round

The speed of sound

Sure as the sun will rise
In the morning sky
We'll never say it, never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
