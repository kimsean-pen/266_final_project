So full of rage, the human race
Hold me while I'm falling down
Rearrange what you have found

(Hurt me)
You see me crawling on the floor
Is that what you've been longing for?
(Hurt me)
Is this enough, do you want more?
Go on if it makes you soar

(Hurt me)
You see me crawling on the floor
Is that what you've been longing for?
(Hurt me)
Is this enough, do you want more?
Go on if it makes you soar

You hate my face, my sweet embrace
You hate me when I'm all around
Enjoy it when I'm burning down

(Hurt me)
You see me crawling on the floor
Is that what you've been longing for?
(Hurt me)
Is this enough, do you want more?
Go on if it makes you soar

(Hurt me)
You see me crawling on the floor
Is that what you've been longing for?
(Hurt me)
Is this enough, do you want more?
Go on if it makes you soar

(Hurt me)
You see me crawling on the floor
Is that what you've been longing for?
(Hurt me)
Is this enough, do you want more?
Go on if it makes you soar

(Hurt me)
You see me crawling on the floor
Is that what you've been longing for?
(Hurt me)
Is this enough, do you want more?
Go on if it makes you soar
(Hurt me)
You see me crawling on the floor
Is that what you've been longing for?
(Hurt me)
Is this enough, do you want more?
Go on if it makes you soar
