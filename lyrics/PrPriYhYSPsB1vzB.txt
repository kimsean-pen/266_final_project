The man is in the house
We bout' to shut it down
Every time I step up in this club
I make it bounce
Don't fuck with small amounts
I buy it by the pound
And when we pulling up
Boy that Lambo making sound
Got that Rollie on my wrist
You know I had to flex
And I got those twin chains
Ice climbers on my neck
Yeah you girl want a drink
It's cool, I got the check
I throw a couple bands
Now she's showing me some respect
(Now she's showing me some respect)

She wanna know where I get this money
How I ball so hard
She wanna know what I do
To afford these clothes
And these dope ass cars

She said, "Are you an actor? Or a model?"
I get the waitress
And we pop some more bottles
She keeps asking, won't let it go
Looks like I really have to let this girl know
I told her I make slime
Slime, slime, slime, slime, slime
Candy D.I.Y.s

Post that shit on YouTube
Children can't believe their eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Yelling loud as shit
Got that family-friendly content
I don't get demonetized

She was understandably put off by that
'Till I show her my million subscriber plaque
Now I'm feeling like David Dobrik
'Cause I got her in the Tesla
And her friends are in the back
Next thing you know,
Now we drinking at the crib
It ain't too long 'till I get shorty in my bed
Slip into something more comfortable
And now I'm back
And she's looking at my YouTube channel
"Wait, don't do that."

She wanna know where I get this money
How I ball so hard
She wanna know what I do
To afford these clothes
And these dope ass cars

She's checking out my videos
She sees me yelling
I'm going crazy 'bout the merch that I'm selling
Now I'm dabbing
And eating spicy foods
I can't tell if she's impressed or disgusted
But she's checking out my slime
Slime, slime, slime, slime, slime
Life hack D.I.Y.s

Post that shit on YouTube
Children can't believe their eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Yelling loud as shit
Got that family-friendly content
I don't get demonetized

I don't get demonetized
There is nary a doubt
I am the Slime King
But I feel so alone
Will you be my slime queen?
I can't tell you how long I've searched
I won't even make you buy my merch
Unless you wanna buy my merch
You're totally free to do so
It is soft as hell
But it only comes in youth sizes
And there's no refunds
No refunds
