I'm reaching for my dreams and you're so quick to say what I can't do
You criticize my actions but I don't see you standing in my shoes
I'm going the wrong way, I'm doing the wrong things
Every word just gives me fuel
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

And tell me no, and I'll show you I can
And tell me no and I'll dig my feet right in
Tell me no, just tell me that I can' t win
Come on, I'm sure I'll prove you wrong, go on and go, tell me no

Now every step I take, you're right there trying to block my next move
And if you're making me feel bad, then tell me then do you feel good
I'm just human and what I'm doing is what my heart tells me I should
So come on come on come on come on come on come on

Tell me no and I'll show you I can
And tell me no and I'll dig my feet right in
Tell me no, just tell me that I can't win
Come on, I'm sure I'll prove you wrong, go on and go, tell me no

No no no no no no no, it motivates me more and more
And I think it's time you know, you're giving me something to afford
And I can't wait for the day, I can rub things in your face
And I ain't gonna stop til I'm done, I reach the top, I'm no.1
For every time you try and tell me no, all it makes me keep on, keep it on

Tell me no and I'll show you I can
And tell me no and I'll dig my feet right in
Tell me no, just tell me that I can't win
Come on, I'm sure I'll prove you wrong, go on and go, tell me no

Tell me no and I'll show you I can
And tell me no and I'll dig my feet right in
And tell me no, just tell me that I can't win
Come on, I'm sure I'll prove you wrong, go on and go, tell me no
