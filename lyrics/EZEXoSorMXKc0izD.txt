Been dead as the disco
With the foot in grave
One thing that you missed though
Baby I'm new wave
Is it bad enough
Is it bad enough to call it off

Let's start up the heat
We gotta get back up
One minute you need me
And the next we're stuck
Is it bad enough
Is it bad enough to call it off

Who you are
What you do
What you need
What's the use
Hold me now I can't help but want you too

Don't say you don't miss me that much
Don't say I don't still make you blush
Cause my ears are burning
My ears are burning up

Sometimes you can't yell loud enough
Sometimes a whisper's just too much
Now my ears are burning
my hears are burning up

Too hot to handle gotta like it rough
Too much of a scandal when the goings get tough
Is it bad enough
Is it bad enough to call it off?

Just came into your window only gets the scene
Just want to crescendo and a killer queen
Since when's that bad enough to call it off?

What you are
What you do
What you need
What's the use
Hold me now I can't help but want you too

Don't say you don't miss me that much
Don't say I don't still make you blush
Cause my ears are burning
My ears are burning up

Sometimes you can't yell loud enough
Sometimes a whisper's just too much
Now my ears are burning
my ears are burning up

Who you are
What you do
What you need
What's the use
Hold me now I can't help but want you tooo

Don't say you don't miss me that much
Don't say I don't still make you blush
Cause my ears are burning
My ears are burning up

Sometimes you can't yell loud enough
Sometimes a whispers too much
my ears are burning
my hears are burning up
Don't say you don't miss me that much
Don't say I don't still make you blush
Cause my ears are burning
My ears are burning up
Sometimes you can't yell loud enough
Sometimes a whispers too much
my ears are burning
my ears are burning up
