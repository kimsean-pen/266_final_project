Outside I saw the moon
And it made me think of you
And the rain it came, and came
There you were inside my brain

I've been thinking of you
I've been thinking of you

Drive there in my car
(I heard the radio)
Play that dylan song
(The times that you were dreaming)
But you still haven't changed your mind
So I sang and sang along
I was singing along

I've been thinking of you
I've been thinking of you
I've been thinking of you
I've been thinking of you

Cause she's in my head
And i can't take it
I need you by my side
yeahh
So I'll take the chance and i'll drive 'till dawn
To show you I'm the one

Outside I saw the moon
And it made me think of you

I've been thinking of you
I've been thinking of you
I've been thinking of you
I've been thinking of you

I've been thinking of you
(I've been thinking of you)
I've been thinking of you
(I've been thinking of you)
I've been thinking of you

I've been thinking of you
