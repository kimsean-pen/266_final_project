Can we play it one time through first?
Uh huh, come on
Said I'm never goin' back (Hey, Hey)
Said I'm never goin' back

Hey yo, I never had a job that I didn't love
I guess I always tend to focus on the positives
'Cause even when I was broke and telemarketing
I would tell my friends that my phone blowin' up
Yeah I'm poppin' kid
As a younging all I listened to is NAS and B.I.G
Wu-Tang, Beastie Boys, De La Soul on replay (Woo)
Don't forget Blink-182 and Green Day
Pack it all together like we living out in Green Bay
You'll get my DNA, like it's 23 and Me
Visions of myself, prolly up on MTV
My momma she my biggest fan
I wonder what she see in me
So much potential as a kid that I could spell it c.i.d
As I grew up, I began to gain confidence
I murder every track 'til it's posthumous
I get a lot of love, I got a lot to give
So I ain't ever going back until I got this shit

There's no going back for me, baby
There's no going back for me, baby
There's no going back for me, baby
There's no going, no going back, no going back

Uh huh, come on
Said I'm never going back
(Uh huh, God damn)
Said I'm never going

I said I'm never goin' back
That's a fact homie
How could you have it all then let it go to crap, homie?
How could you spend your whole record deal advance, homie?
Throwing money in the club like it grow on trees
I heard you bought a bunch of whips
And you paid straight cash
You made one hot song, they wrote one fat check
You spent it way too fast thinkin' it would always last
But there's no going back
You can't change up the past
I got a different mindset
I'm tryna change up my class
Like, bitch, you gon' have to graduate my ass
Watch me get my dream job, then I quit that shit
Now I roll in Spotify and tell them spin that shit
I'll go and buy the old house that I grew up in
Flip that shit, I won't move in
If I'm chillin' with your girl and her friends
It's only 'cause they tens
Don't be mad, I'll prolly never see your ass again (grr)

There's no going back for me, baby
There's no going back for me, baby
There's no going back for me, baby
There's no going, no going back, no going back
No go, no go, no go, no

Uh huh, come on
Said I'm never goin' back
(Uh huh, Uh huh)
Said I'm never goin' back
(Uh huh, Come on)
Said I'm never goin' back
(Uh huh, God damn)
Said I'm never goin' back
