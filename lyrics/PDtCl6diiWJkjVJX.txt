I sold my soul for a turn with you
There you control all the things I do
I'm giving you the impression to love sometimes
There you control all the things I do

I hear the voices
You here me calling
You're on my mind
You're on my mind
I hear the voices
You here me calling
You're on my mind
You're on my mind
I sold my soud for a turn with you-

I sold my soul for a turn with you

I sold my soul for a turn with you
There you control all the things I do
I'm giving you the impression to love sometimes
There you control all the things I do

I hear the voices
You here me calling
You're on my mind
You're on my mind
I hear the voices
You here me calling
You're on my mind
You're on my mind
I sold my soud for a turn with you-

I sold my soul for a turn with you
