In the early morning
Universal but somewhere new
I was still breathing underwater
But I couldn't move
Doesn't seem like I did
But I've tried to make words for you
As I imagined all the things that
We could still do

I don't think we're conscious
Maybe we're not done yet

I just caught an idea
That appeared to fall from the moon
One of my thoughts slipped out of the water
I couldn't move
But if it's possible for me to believe
We'll ever be alone
Maybe we're just fellow prisoners
Forcing all of our pain into the world

I don't think we're conscious
Maybe we're not done yet

But so soon
You'll ever get
It's not gonna help me sleep
The time hurts
We're settled down
But part of us stays here
Maybe we're not done

I don't think we're conscious
Maybe we've never done it
Maybe we are done
Maybe we're not done yet

I'll miss you so
I'll miss you so
I'll miss you so
I'll miss you so
