(*) Let's go - go on vacation
Our love could stand a renovation
Let's go - go on vacation
Our love could stand a renovation

Now and then I feel
Our love is condemned
I wanna get back on the right track
I won't pretend that everything's alright
A double L R I G H T for me
'Cause our love was built on honesty
Folks say that Philly is a city of brotherly love
You know it's a pity that we cannot
Trust each other anymore
Let's leave the big metropolis
And head down to the shore

(* repeat 2 times)

California here we come
To your golden sun sinking in the sand
We'll go walking hand in hand
Thru the streets of Beverly Hills
Don't care if we're exhausted
With the prices going up
We feel the cost is very very cheap
The price of love is steep
A holiday we need
It's a perfect remedy
City lights are far behind us
There will be nothing in our path to blind us

(* repeat ad lib and fade)
