Under violet skies, I watched you give into the wild
Some throbbing howl
Eat me alive
I love your mouth

I'd like to roll around your tounge
Caught like a bicycle spoke
You eat, I'll grow and grow
Swelling up until you choke

With my violet eyes, I'll make you succumb to my mind
And through it all
I'll keep you blind and close my mouth

I hold you here between my teeth
Slack like an elephant's trunk
I'll fight the urge to bite
Or I'll get sticky resin in my gums

I love your mouth
I love your mouth
I love your mouth
I love your mouth
I love your mouth

Under violet skies, I watched you give into the wild
Some throbbing howl
Eat me alive
I love your mouth
(I love your mouth)

With my violet eyes, I made you succumb to my mind
And through it all
I kept you blind
I love your mouth

I'd like to roll around your tongue
Caught like a bicycle spoke
You eat, I'll grow and grow
Swelling up until you choke
