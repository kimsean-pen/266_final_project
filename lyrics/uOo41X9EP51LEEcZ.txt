Lightning fell from the sky
You weren't able to step inside
Lightning dwells in your eyes
You wanna hear how the blast subsides

I'm a lost installment in your ear
I'm the final one to interfere
In a trending picture we are thin air

Lightning fell from the sky
We are impossibly grounded by all the death you apply
How are we certain that you survived?

I'm a lost installment in your ear
I'm the final one to interfere
In a trending picture we are thin air

Reel the caller in
Cultivate the sound of fur
I will praise your chin
I will shake if I'm a blur
Tossed and found porcelain hound

I'm a lost installment in your ear
I'm the final one to interfere
In a trending picture we are thin
air
