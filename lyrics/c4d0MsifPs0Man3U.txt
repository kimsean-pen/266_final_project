I can't get a hold of myself
Breaking all the rules, playing games with my health
My loves say, I'm gone off the rails
I know it's okay 'cause I do it so well

I'm in my twenties, living reckless
So turn the hourglass over and let's wreck this
It's a brand new world, I got a brand new heart
And everyday I make a brand new start
I'm in my twenties, not in a hurry
I got a bulletproof chest so you can't hurt me
It's a brand new world, I got a brand new heart
And everyday I get a brand new start

All my friends take good care of me
Wherever I go they bring me home
When I got no place to be
All my friends take good care of me
They get me high, they're on my side
As far as I can see, yeah

I'm in my twenties, I'm the future
I'm a shaker and I'm a mover
Got a vision coming from afar
Gonna take me back to where you are
I'm in my twenties, not gettin' restless
Got some hip now on my diamond necklace
It's a brand new world, I got a brand new heart
And everyday I get a brand new start

All my friends take good care of me
Wherever I go they bring me home
When I got no place to be
All my friends take good care of me
They get me high, they're on my side
As far as I can see, yeah

I can't get a hold of myself
Breaking all these rules, playing games with my health
And my loves said I'm gone off the rails
But I know it's okay 'cause I do it so well

All my friends take good care of me
Wherever I go they bring me home
When I got no place to be
All my friends take good care of me
They get me high, they're on my side
As far as I can see, yeah

All my friends (take good care of me)
Wherever I go they bring me home
All my friends (take good care of me)
They get me high, they're on my side
(They get me high, they're on my side)
