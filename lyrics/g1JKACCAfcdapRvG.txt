Aight, Is it on?
Aight let's go, let's get it

Just tell me some workin
Tell me that its workin
When you up and they down they make me uncertain
But when you down then ill be
I got this problem that none one can stop me
They talking shit but I know that they copy
Stick to the plan, I'll be stacking the bands to the top
Stuffing my pants and the pockets with knots

I done blow it on henny
Tell me and my other bitch, you know I got plenty
Bout to make a move, I'ma stack me a benji
Met a bitch named Jenny, she be goin off the shits
But the bag say Gucci and the belt say Fendi
Talkin shit online but they don't know any of the hands
Imma throw it in they face
Hit em in the tooth now you loose out of place
Only sixteen but the screen hide your face
Say you got a knife put your life on my waist
Imma make em look dumb just for fun
Throw a man to the ground like it's nothing
If I could then I would I'ma trade me a bottle for a gun
Thinking you a man till you reachin' out your hand for a fund
Now we gone down the same shit like a rerun
It's like I seen it in a past life, it's all the same
Talking bout my money, now they sayin' shit bout my name
Now they jealous, holding Louis umbrellas block the shade
Roll up on me, I put fifty ya face
Press your hands saying grace
Looking up and I ain't seeing no face in the sky
Gotcha you worshiping a God
You never seen with your eyes
I be saying all the time I ain't vibing with that
I keep a sack in my hat
It keep my mind intact

Just tell me somethin' workin'
Tell me that its workin'
When you up and they down they make me uncertain
But when you down then ill be
I got this problem and none one can stop me
They talking shit but I know that they copy
Stick to the plan, I'll be stacking the bands to the top
Stuffing the pants and the pockets with knots
