DY Krazy
Ayy, it's so crazy
'Cause I made this song off another nigga feelings
Know what I'm sayin'?
What he going through with his bitch
Know what I'm sayin'?
He actually one of my dogs
Know what I'm sayin'?
So, here you go

We ain't talk in a minute, so don't hit me up
And I mix my feelings with prescription drugs
When I fell to my knees, you ain't pick me up
When I was down on my back
you said I ain't rich enough
And we ain't talk about no sex
'Cause you ain't get it up
And I don't want you to suck my dick
'Cause you ain't spit enough
You an ungrateful lil' bitch, said I ain't spend enough
You told me you want your ass shots
'Cause you ain't thick enough
I'm in the trenches with the sharks
I ain't have a heart
Some nights I ain't wanna talk
I left you in the dark
You was lurkin' on my page, you became a narc'
You was writing bitches back, that shit went too far
And I carried you on my back like I ain't have a car
You was kinda mad I hang with murderers
Bitch, you Instagram famous, but you not a star
(Instagram famous, but you not a star)

Bitch, I made you
Took you out the hood and I saved you
While them other niggas tried to play you
Bitch, you ungrateful,
Bitch, you ungrateful, bitch, you u
I ain't want a label
I ain't want a label
I ain't tryna be your friend
Or your man, or your husband
I don't want a label

You steady throwin' your pussy
but I don't want none
I got a wife, so after me you gotta fuck Von
Then Ikey, then Booka, then it's more fun
I kick her out slick as hell, tell her, Store run
I know a couple divas, that's still a secret
The bitches I made eat it
You would not believe it
This shit was never easy
I move strategic
Me and two, three singers, we had a threesome
Back to back, fuckin' back to back, off the perky
Back to back, told her all them lies
I was perfect
Always tryna run the streets deep
I was thirsty
Gotta watch my back, a lot of niggas tryna hurt me
That's why I keep my .50 and my .30
Niggas ain't on shit, they washed up, detergent
Big Backwood, sat back and burned it
I'm better, hot like a furnace, yeah

Bitch, I made you
Took you out the hood and I saved you
While them other niggas tried to play you
Bitch, you ungrateful,
Bitch, you ungrateful, bitch, you un
I ain't want a label
I ain't want a label
I ain't tryna be your friend
Or your man, or your husband
I don't want a label
