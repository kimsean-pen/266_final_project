I am fleeing, but I do not know what from
Life has no time for me, life has no time here

I am fleeing, but I do not know what from
When I die, I'm going back to what I was
I am fleeing, but I do not know what from
When I die, I'm going back to what I was

Nothing, nothing, nothing

You can not sleep at night and you spend your time
At the end of breath
As your knowledge pushes you to the end of time
The doctors will not cure your torment
The right to seek is in your hands
Seek now, seek now

I am fleeing, but I do not know what from
I am fleeing, but I do not know what from
Life has no time for me, let me be free

It will linger in your soul
It will linger in your soul
It will linger in your soul

If you are fleeing and you do not know
It will linger in your soul

When I die, I'll go back to where I was
