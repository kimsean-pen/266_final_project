She don't care
About my car
And she don't care
About my money
And that's real good
'cause I don't got
A lot to spend
But if I did
It wouldn't mean nothin'

She likes me for me
Not because I
Look like Tyson Beckford
With the charm
Of Robert Redford
Oozing out my ears
But what she sees
Are my faults
And indecisions
My insecure conditions
And the tears upon
The pillow that I shed

She don't care
About my big screen
Or my collection of DVD's
Things like that
just never mattered
Much to her
Plus she don't
Watch too much T.V.
She don't care
That I can fly her
To places she
Ain't never been
If she really wants to go
I think deep down
She knows that
All she has to
Say is when

She likes me for me
Not because I
Hang with Leonardo
Or that guy who played in Fargo
I think his name is Steve
She's the one for me
And I just can't live without her
My arms belong around her
And I'm so glad
I found her once again
I found her once again

Gazing at the ceiling
As we entertain our
Feelings in the dark
The things that
We're afraid of
Are gonna show us
What we're made of in the end

She likes me for me
Not because I sing like Pavarotti
Or because I'm such a hottie
(Hah)
I like her for her
Not because she's
Phat like Cindy Crawford
She has got so much to offer
Why does she waste
All her time with me
There must be something
There that I don't see
I don't see

She likes me for me
Not because I'm
Tough like Dirty Harry
Make her laugh
Just like Jim Carrey
Unlike The Cable Guy
But what she sees
Is that I can't live without her
My arms belong around her
And I'm so glad I found her once again
And I'm so glad I found her once again
