I've never been closer
I've tried to understand
That certain feeling

Carved by anothers hand
But it's too late to hesitate
We can't keep on living like this

Leave no track
Don't look back
All I desire (temptation)
Keep climbing higher and higher (temptation)

Adorable creatures (temptation)
With unacceptable features (temptation)
And trouble is coming (temptation)

Its just the high cost of loving (temptation)
And you can take it or leave it (temptation)
But you'd better believe it

You've got to make me an offer
That cannot be ignored
So lets head for home now

Everything I have is yours
Step by step and day by day
Every second counts I can't break away

Leave no trace
Hide your face.
All I desire (temptation)

Keep climbing higher and higher (temptation)
And you can take it or leave it (temptation)
But you'd better believe it (yeah)

Step by step and day by day
Every second counts
I can't break away

Keep us from temptation,
Keep us from temptation,
Keep us from temptation, lead us
Not into temptation

Trying to find it (temptation)
You've got to get up behind it (temptation)
Put your dime in the hot slot (temptation)

But it's a million to one shots (temptation)
You think you're right now (temptation)
You've got to fake it tonight now (temptation)

And now you give me a breakdown (temptation)
Because it's time for a shakedown (temptation)
Temptation.
