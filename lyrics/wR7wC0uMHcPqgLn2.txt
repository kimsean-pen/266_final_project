Oh my love
Why the sky bleeds
The clouds have greyed
Have showed us how
To fall and run at the same time
It's like a house of glass
Paper thin comes crashing in
Our cold cold hearts
Caught in flames and it's tearing us apart
But I'm not here anymore
I'm not here anymore
I'm not here anymore without you
Silence sores through the phone
Come back down the distant shore
Catch these waves like before
Without you
Crystal lights
Rusted in our future
Covered up with lies
Wearing off on our dreams
Through these cold cold nights
Shallow frames are the memories we contain
But I'm not here anymore
I'm not here anymore
I'm not here anymore without you
Oh silence sores through the phone
Come back down the distant shore
Catch these waves like before
Without you
But I'm not here anymore
I'm not here anymore
I'm not here anymore without you
Oh silence sores through the phone
Come back down the distant shore
Catch these waves like before
Without you
