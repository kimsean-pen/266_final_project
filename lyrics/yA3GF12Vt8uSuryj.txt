This is for us
I'm fear, I'm flight
In darkened waters we must unite
My allied ocean, my queen, my death
A sun explosion
It manifests

When darkness is falling
Want the world to burn
The fire to spread and there's nowhere to turn
At the end of the rope
I can't hold on
Want this world to burn
Want this world to burn

This emptiness not transient
And it will never stop
It's never silent
My allied ocean
My life escape
A sun I saw but never felt

When darkness is falling
Want the world to burn
The fire to spread and there's nowhere to turn
At the end of the rope
I can't hold on
Want this world to burn
Want this world to burn

When darkness is falling
Want the world to burn
The fire to spread and there's no one to turn to
At the end of the rope
I can't hold on
Want this world to burn
Want this world to burn
