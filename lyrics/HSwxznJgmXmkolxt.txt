Waking up too early in the city feeling disconnected
The underground and my understanding have delays on the line
The weather and the way we worked out weren't quite as expected
I've been melting in the summer heat going out of my mind

So far from okay
Tongue-tied and afraid
The big things stay the same
And you just say

Little changes
Little changes

Giving up too easy when we could've tried a little bit harder
Standing to the side as the neighbourhood went to the dogs
We spend our energy getting angry instead of being kinder
Singing hymns of praise in a city given up on by the gods

So far from okay
Tongue-tied and afraid
The big things stay the same until we make

Little changes
Little changes
Little changes

'Cause I've been messing things up
And I've been letting you down
I've been getting it wrong for far too long
I've been lost more than found
And I don't know where to stop
But something's gotta break
Don't pull out the part, keep it close to your heart
I'll do whatever it takes

So far from okay
Tongue-tied and afraid
The big things stay the same
Let us make

Little changes
Little changes
Come on let's make some little changes
It's time to make some little changes

Let's not just pray
Let's make a change
Let's not just pray
Let's make a change
Come on let's make some little changes
It's time to make some little changes
