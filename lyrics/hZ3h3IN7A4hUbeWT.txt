I think it's time to put myself away
Seek out a little silence
Close the doors and sit a while
And walk a little

And as I put my words away
The flow slows
See this penny in the stream
Pickin' it up is easy

Follow the shape of it
Jump in
Swallow it whole
Jump in

Even though I know my way around
Possibly there's something that I found
Holdin' on for findin' solid ground
Someday soon, someday soon

Gonna turn myself into the grass
And I'll grow
Take this space above my head
And live a little, little

Gonna wear my feathered headdress
Like an Indian chief
Gonna stretch out both my arms
I'm gonna test the temperature

Follow the taste of it
Jump in
Swallow it whole
Jump in

Even though I know my way around
Possibly there's something new I found
Holdin' on for findin' solid ground
Oh, oh, oh

Even though I know my way around
Possibly there's something new I found
Holdin' on for findin' solid ground
Someday soon, someday soon

Maybe walk a little
Someday soon
