What the world needs now is love, sweet love
It's the only thing, that there's just too little of
What the world needs now is love, sweet love,
No, not just for some, but for everyone

Lord we don't need another mountain
There are mountains and hillsides
Enough to climb
There are oceans and rivers,
Enough to cross, enough to last till the end of time

What the world needs now is love, sweet love
It's the only thing that there's just too little of
What the world needs now is love, sweet love
No, not just for some, but for everyone

Lord, we don't need another meadow
There are cornfields and wheat fields
Enough to grow
There are sunbeams and moonbeams
Enough to shine
Oh listen Lord, if you want to know

What the world needs now is love, sweet love
It's the only thing that there's just too little of
What the world needs now is love, sweet love
No, not just for some,
But for everyone

What the world needs now is love, sweet love
What the world needs now is love, sweet love
What the world needs now is love, sweet love

What the world needs now is love, sweet love
What the world needs now is love, sweet love
