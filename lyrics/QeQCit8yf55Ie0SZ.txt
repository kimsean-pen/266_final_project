Steppin' out on the street to
get some air
All this seems so unfair
But I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could fight It but I no I
Cannot let it go

Got these feelings inside me
That I can't control
Can't deny
Could get used to this

I wish on a star tonight
That I could freeze time for
One night
I would turn back time
I would cross the line
Just to claim that you
Were mine
I would come to you
Meet you on the other side

I can't explain but I've go to
go somewhere
It's complicated, this pain
But I could get used to it
I could get used to it
I don't anymore if this is
right or wrong
I just can't ignore these
thoughts inside my head
Like I said
Could get used to this

I wish on a star tonight
That I could freeze time for
One night
I would turn back time
I would cross the line
Just to claim that you
Were mine
I would come to you
Meet you on the other side

Can't let go
You're climbing in my head
Won't let go
But I could get used to this
I could get used to this
Can't you see
How you're tormenting me
Don't you see
You've gone deep inside of me
Inside of me

I wish on a star tonight
That I could freeze time for
One night
I would turn back time
I would cross the line
Just to claim that you
Were mine
I would come to you
Meet you on the other side
