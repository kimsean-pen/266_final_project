This is not the way into my heart, into my head
Into my brain, into none of the above
This is just my way of unleashing the feelings deep inside of me
This spark of black that I seem to love

We can get a little crazy just for fun, just for fun
Don't even try to hold it back, just let go
Tie me up and take me over till you're done, 'til I'm done
You got me feening and I'm ready to blow

Push up to my body, sink your teeth into my flesh
(Get undressed, t-taste the flesh)
Bite into me harder, sink your teeth into my flesh
(Pass the test, t-taste the flesh)

Hold me up against the wall
Give it 'til I beg, give me some more
Make me bleed, I like it raw
Like it raw, raw, raw

Push up to my body, sink your teeth into my flesh

Hold my arms above my head and push my face into the bed
'Cause I'm a screamer baby, make me a mute
You put your hand upon my neck and feel the pulse beat-beat-beat-beat
It's like a trigger get me ready to shoot

Wanna wrestle with me baby, here's a sneak little peak
You can dominate the game 'cause I'm tough
I don't play around that often, when I do, I'm a freak
So you'd better believe I like it rough

Push up to my body, sink your teeth into my flesh
(Get undressed, t-taste the flesh)
Bite into me harder, sink your teeth into my flesh
(Pass the test, t-taste the flesh)

Hold me up against the wall
Give it 'til I beg, give me some more
Make me bleed, I like it rough
Like it rough, rough, rough

Push up to my body, sink your teeth into my flesh

Hold me down and make me scream
Lay me on the floor
Turn me on and take me out
Make me beg for more

Push up to my body, sink your teeth into my flesh
(Get undressed, t-taste the flesh)
Bite into me harder, sink your teeth into my flesh
(Pass the test, t-taste the flesh)

Hold me up against the wall
Give it 'til I beg, give me some more
Make me bleed, I like it raw
Like it raw, raw, raw

Push up to my body, sink your teeth into my flesh

Push up to my body, sink your teeth into my flesh
(Get undressed, t-taste the flesh)
Bite into me harder, sink your teeth into my flesh
(Pass the test, t-taste the flesh)

Hold me up against the wall
Give it 'til I beg, give me some more
Make me bleed, I like it raw
Like it raw, raw, raw

Push up to my body, sink your teeth into my flesh

Push up to my body, sink your teeth into my flesh
(Get undressed, t-taste the flesh)
Bite into me harder, sink your teeth into my flesh
(Pass the test, t-taste the flesh)

Hold me up against the wall
Give it 'til I beg, give me some more
Make me bleed, I like it raw
Like it raw, raw, raw

Push up to my body, sink your teeth into my flesh
