Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic
'Til I'm gathered safely in
Lift me like an olive branch
And be my homeward dove

Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Let me see your beauty
When the witnesses are gone
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of

Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to the wedding now
Dance me on and on
Dance me very tenderly
And dance me very long
We're both of us beneath our love
We're both of us above

Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to the children
Who are asking to be born
Dance me through the curtains
That our kisses have outworn
Raise a tent of shelter now
Though every thread is torn

Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic
'Til I'm gathered safely in
Touch me with your naked hand
Touch me with your glove

Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love
