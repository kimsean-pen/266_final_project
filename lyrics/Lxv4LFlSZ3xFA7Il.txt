As someone said
Life got led
By people who
Just wanna flood your head
And I'd have probably second guessed
Everything that was said
But it fits you at the time
To fall for every line

They said I
Give my love to all
All the ones that stuck around
The ones I counted on
When I needed to get out
And I share my love with all
All the people that come round
When I've lost count of all

Things dragging us to ground

As someone said
Life got led
By people who
Just wanna fuck with my head
And I'd have probably second guessed
Yes I'd have kept my wits about me

But it fits you at the time
To fall for every line
They said I
Give my love to all
All the ones who stuck around
The ones I counted on
When I needed to get out
And I share my love with all

All the people that come round
When I've lost count of all
Things dragging us to ground

Oh, convinced me every time
That I needed fooling
So that I'd go and get it right

They said I
Give my love to all

All the ones that stuck around
The ones I counted on
When I needed to get out
And I share my love with all
All the people that come round

Oh, convinced me every time
That I needed fooling
So that I'd go and get it right
Yes somewhere they
Convinced me down the line
When I needed fooling
So that I'd go and get it right
