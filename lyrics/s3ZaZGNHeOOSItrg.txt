I heard the men saying something
The captains tell they pay you well
And they say they need sailing men to
Show the way and leave today
Was it you that said, "How long, how long?"

They say the sea turns so dark that
You know it's time, you see the sign
They say the point Demon's Guard is
An ocean grave, for all the brave
Was it you that said, "How long, how long?
How long to the point of no return?"

Your father, he said he needs you
Your mother, she says she loves you
Your brothers, they echo your words
How far to the point of no return?
(No return)
To the point of no return
(Aah)
Oh oh
How long?
How long?

Today I found a message floating
In the sea from you to me
Wrote that, when you could see it
You cried with fear, the point was near
Was it you that said, "How long, how long?
How long to the point of no return?"

How long?
How long to the point of no return?
(How long?)
No return
(How long?)
How long?
How long?
