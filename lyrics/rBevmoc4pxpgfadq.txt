You turned me on, you lift me up
Like the sweetest cup I'd share with you
You lift me up, don't you ever stop, I'm here with you
Now it's all or nothing 'cause you say you'll follow through
You follow me and I, I, I follow you
(What you gonna do when things go wrong)
(What you gonna do when it all cracks up)
(What you gonna do when the love burns down)
(What you gonna do when the flames go up)
(Who's you gonna come and turn the tide)
(What's it gonna take) To make a dream survive
(Who's got the touch) To calm the storm inside
(Who's gonna save you)
Alive and kicking
Stay until your love is, alive and kicking
Until your love is, until your love is, alive

Oh, you lift me up to the crucial top, so I can see
Oh, you lead me on, till the feelings come
And the lights that shine on, but if that don't mean nothing
Like if someday it should fall through
You'll take me home where the magic's from and I'll be with you
(What you gonna do when things go wrong)
(What you gonna do when it all cracks up)
(What you gonna do when the love burns down)
(What you gonna do when the flames go up)
(Who is gonna come and turn the tide)
(What's it gonna take) To make a dream survive
(Who's got the touch) To calm the storm inside
(Don't say goodbye, don't say goodbye)
(In the final seconds who's gonna save you)
Oh, alive and kicking
Oh, stay until your love is, love is, alive and kicking
Oh, alive and kicking
Oh, stay until your love is, love is, alive and kicking

Oh, alive and kicking
Stay until your love is, alive and kicking

Stay until your love is, alive and kicking
