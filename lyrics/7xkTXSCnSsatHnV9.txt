Darlin' through these clothes that I bought you no less
(Won't) get you what you need on
The trouble crosses and then
It's only your fixes that did never fit
No one's gonna make you cry for your love life tonight
Ohhh, how do I know
It's because I believe
In a love that is so strong
It's a love crush number one
If a love crush says come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on,
Yea I said come on,
Wow, I said come on
Yes like this
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on,
Yes like this
Yes, you know raving crazy to say things
I did you were sure
We don't need no panic patches some more
Look reality forbids you pin don't you feel it
No one's gonna make you fight your love life tonight
Oh no, why do I know
It's because I believe
In a love that is so strong
It's (In?) a love crush number one
(If) it's a love crush says come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on,
Yea I said come on,
Wow, I said come on
Yes like this
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on,
Yes like this
I said no, not the room at the top
I can't speed down and the pressures dropped
No longer room at the top
Oh we're gonna speed down and the pressures dropped
How do I know
It's because I believe
In a love that is so strong
It's a love crush number one
If[And that's?] a love crush says come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on
You're gonna get it tonight
You're gonna get it tonight
You're gonna get it tonight
You're gonna get it tonight
