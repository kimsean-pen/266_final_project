I know that it's been rough
It shows in your reflection
You've fallen out of touch
Got lost along the way
I know it's not enough
But these things they'll all get better
And even if it's tough

This is us, you know it on the inside
(Us, Us...) so you should show it on the outside
This is us, dust the dust up off your shoulders
Feet on ground, you'll come round
And be human again

I know that it's been hard
But even when it's hurting
You're gonna have to start
To learn to recognize
That even in the dark
There's lines between the spaces

Hiding where you are
This is us, you know it on the inside
(Us, us...)so you should show it on the outside
This is us, dust the dust up off your shoulders

Feet on ground, you'll come round
And be human again.
(Feet on ground)
