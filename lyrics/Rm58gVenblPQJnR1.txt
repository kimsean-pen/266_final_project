You're my cannibal lover
I feel it when you're underneath the skin
creepin' in again
well I know this chemical feeling
is making me forget about the drugs
you poison with your love
and when I think I'm out of the dark
You're pulling me away from the light
take me where you want me tonight
and let me swoon over you
let me swoon over you
and there's nothing I can do
so let me swoon over you
don't you know you're just another heart breaker
don't you know you're just another heartbreaker?
just another, just another heartbreaker
don't you know you're just another heartbreaker?
a heartbreaker
a heartbreaker.
This sensational high
This sensational low
I can't control for reasons I don't know
who you are
and it's a possibility
a psychedelic symphony
you are, you are to me
and when I think I'm out of the dark
You're pulling me away from the light
take me where you want me tonight
and let me swoon over you
let me swoon over you
and there's nothing I can do
so let me swoon over you
don't you know you're just another heartbreaker
don't you know you're just another heartbreaker
just another, just another heartbreaker
don't you know you're just another heartbreaker
a heartbreaker, a heartbreaker
don't you know you're just another heartbreaker
don't you know you're just another heartbreaker
just another, just another heartbreaker
a heartbreaker, a heartbreaker
got lost losing sleep
you're my fever dream
I know...
you're just another heartbreaker
heartbreaker
and let me swoon over you
and let me swoon over you
and there's nothing I can do
so let me swoon over you
don't you know you're just another heartbreaker
don't you know you're just another heartbreaker
just another, just another heartbreaker
don't you know you're just another heartbreaker
a heartbreaker, a heartbreaker
don't you know you're just another heartbreaker
don't you know you're just another heartbreaker
just another, just another heartbreaker
heartbreaker
heartbreaker
