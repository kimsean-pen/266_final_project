She loves me she loves me she loves me
A love from outer space
She loves me she loves me she loves me
A love from outer space
She loves me she loves me she loves me
A love from outer space
She loves me she loves me she loves me
A love from outer space
A love from outer space

It's true oh

I know where she's coming from
Space is where we both belong
Got to tell her in this song
This time nothing can go wrong

I know where she's coming from
Space is where we both belong
Got to tell her in this song
This time, love, we can't go wrong

A ticket to ride this space express
Meet the girl in the starstruck dress
She trusts me more than I can never guess
Just can't wait for her caress
She comes from the Milky Way
She came to Earth for my birthday
We worked out hard to communicate
She said 'hi' and I said

Shalalala hey
Shalalalalalala hey
Shalalalalalala hey
Shalalalalalala hey

Shalalala hey
Shalalalalalala hey
Shalalala hey
Shalalalalalala hey

She loves me she loves me she loves me
A love from outer space
It's true oh
She loves me she loves me she loves me
A love from outer space
It's true oh

She loves me she loves me she loves me
A love from outer space
A love from outer space
A love from outer space
A love from outer space
A love from outer space
It's true yeah
It's true yeah

She loves me she loves me she loves me
A love from outer space
