It's Amerie, I took a little time out
Took a vacation but boys, I'm back
Pardon the interruption but we got a news flash
Someone in the buildin' said Amerie's back

I done heard 'em all talk 'bout how much they want me
But ain't never had nobody put it on me
Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me

Some of them wonder what it take to be my lover
First you gotta be my drummer, don't move fast
You can pop tags on the Louis bags
But it won't get you under my covers

I done heard 'em all talk 'bout how much they want me
But ain't never had nobody put it on me
Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me

I done heard 'em all talk 'bout how much they want me
But ain't never had nobody put it on me
Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me

Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me

You asked me to let you explain, I done that
Same talk, same game, same thing, I done that
I need a Kingston feature
That will never run when the dance floor, heat up, heat up

I done heard 'em all talk 'bout how much they want me
But ain't never had nobody put it on me
Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me

I done heard 'em all talk 'bout how much they want me
But ain't never had nobody put it on me
Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me

Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me

Sometimes
I wanna a man to make me feel
What I really need to feel
But do you really know what I want this time?

But sometimes
I wanted you to know what it is
'Cause lately what I've been gettin'
Ain't so real, so real, so real

Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
Get to what you're doin' 'cause it ain't been done to me
