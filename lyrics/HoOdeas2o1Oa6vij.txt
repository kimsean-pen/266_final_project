The world flashing past
So many of us moving so fast
I feel my heart slow
As we wonder I don't bow down
Nothing left undecided
Upon steel on steel
Through these cuts in the Earth
No question who was here first
Many dreams many lifetimes
Any of which could be me
Ecxept that I'm the one unable to move upon this machine
Upon this machine

Pardon caravan emotion
Alone in crowds just like me
I fell between the moments
I fell between the endings
As rain runs around the windows
Nothing here is still
All the paths have collided
Through all these villages and hills
So many dreams so many lifetimes
Any of which could be me

Ecxept that I'm the one unable to move upon this machine

Theres no one else, no one else, no one else, no one else.
Theres no one else, no one else, no one else, no one else.

Theres no one else, no one else, no one else, no one can help me now

Help me im stuck in this moving thing
Nothing is what it seems
No getting off this machine
The song is about feeling lost amongst the crowd doing the same old repetitive motion
and just being a gear in a machine lacking any creativity.
