A fantasy awakes, a dark desire to
Watch you slip away into oblivion
I can't wait to see your flesh turn pale
When I hear the last breath you take fail

Even with you dead, I still feel the pain
In my heart, things will never be the same
Now I must live out this dark fantasy
I am not the man I came to be

Should I feel this way I'm not supposed to
I can't find it in me to care at all
It's a shame we don't see eye to eye
That's why I am here to take your life

Even with you dead, I still feel the pain
In my heart, things will never be the same
Now I must live out this dark fantasy
I am not the man I came to be

Serenity never felt so empty
Sanity never came back to me
I'm not stable
I'm not stable
I'm not stable
I'm not stable

Even with you dead, I still feel the pain
In my heart, things will never be the same
Now I must live out this dark fantasy
I am not the man I came to be
