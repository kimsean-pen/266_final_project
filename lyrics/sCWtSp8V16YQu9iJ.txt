Mary Jane
With the gang, OT gang
Forty deep, we sliding, nigga
What's the info, ayy, ayy
What's your info, ayy, ya
My bitch sweet, candy cane
Acting like you know my name
It's a shame, how these niggas
Pillow talking, pussy nigga

Sex your bitch inside a plane
Then I came, put my kids
Inside your baby mama mouth
And she a nympho, ayy, ayy

To the shit I said

Naked all up in my bed, ayy, ayy
Put two shots inside my head
Try to save me but you
Left my soul beside your leg, ayy
Call me crazy, but you
Such a fan, ayy
All I see is red until the
Day I'm dead, ayy (Sweet) ayy

Jane, Mary Jane

Mary Jane
With the gang, OT gang
Forty deep, we sliding, nigga

Niggas pillow talking, pussy nigga
