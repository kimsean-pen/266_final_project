Ashes, ashes, dust to dust
It doesn't hurt enough yet, does it, does it?
I'm gonna make you feel it
Gonna make you want it
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down,
Half of you's still underground
I'm gonna make you feel it
Gonna make you want it
Don't you want to feel something
In those heavy little veins of yours?
Clock's ticking now, get your body off the floor
This is your addiction
So you can play the victim
But you can't make me play along

Oh fight back your demons
Don't let them take you down
Oh scream like you mean it
Make me believe you now

Ashes, ashes in the air
Remains of dead dreams everywhere
I'm gonna make you feel it
Gonna make you want it
Ashes, ashes, could be you
But you're still beating aren't you?
I'm gonna make you feel it
Gonna make you want it
Aren't you gonna do something with that pretty little heart of yours?
Get up, move, get your body off the floor
This world is twisted
It's the human condition
But you don't have to play along

Pain didn't change me
I changed my pain
Pain didn't change me
I changed my pain

Oh fight back your demons
Don't let them take you down
Oh scream like you mean it
Make me believe you now

We didn't come this far to just get this far

You didn't come this far to just get this far
You didn't shoot for the moon just to hit the stars
You didn't work this hard just to fade to black
It cuts me in half to see you hold back
And you'll know when you're lost 'cause I won't let you sleep through the night
I won't let you sleep through the night
I promise you I'll be here screaming at you baby fight baby fight baby fight...

Oh fight back your demons
Don't let them take you down
Oh scream like you mean it
Make me believe you now

Oh fight back your demons
Don't let them take you down
Oh scream like you mean it
Make me believe you now
