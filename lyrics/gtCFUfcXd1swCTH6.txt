In the sewer all alone, that's my home
Can't pay you anything right now, give you a loan
Don't know you, you're not my bro, where you from?
Change my face, I grow my hair, need a comb
Slowly lose to decay, lost my hope
Drain Gang and you can't hang with us, need a rope
They're still talking about my name, they're on coke
Trashman, I waste my days, in the smoke

I fell off in the night, bring back Thaiboy, I say it twice
Bring myself up to the light, yeah bitch, you know I'm high
Blood moon forge a contract when it's signed
Blood pact I wrote you, baby, with a knife
Trash Star, I eat the night, I do it twice
Backstab you out of nowhere, you're surprised
Backstab you, I don't know why you're surprised
God damn, you ain't on shit, why you so hyped?
God damn, I wonder why am I alive
I give myself up to the Red Light
I give myself up to the Red Light

I give myself up to the Red Light

In the sewer all alone, that's my home
Can't pay you anything right now, give you a loan
Don't know you, you're not my bro, where you from?
Change my face, I grow my hair, need a comb
Slowly lose to decay, lost my hope
Drain Gang and you can't hang with us, need a rope
They're still talking about my name, they're on coke
Trashman, I waste my days, in the smoke
