Uh, uh, huh, uh, huh
Uh, yo, hold up, hold up
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Yo hold up, hold up, hold up, okay, hold up
You see a bad bitch coming, tell yo ass to hold up
I'm in that new new meeting Nunu when I roll up
I told the valet, "Park the Benz and bring the Rolls up"
Yo hold up, hold up, hold up, okay, hold up
He see me lookin' pretty every time he scroll up
Might gotta let the blicky hit you if you stroll up
Now put your hands up, it's a hold up
Run me the money

'Cause I be the baddie B, Barbie Tingz
Banging body B, everybody be on my D
Yo I gotta be in reality, suck a D if you doubted me
Back of the back, back of the back
Back of the back, back of the back
Who on Barbie D? Who on Barbie D? Everybody
Who you gotta see? Honestly, on my odyssey
I'm the baddest B, I don't even know how to speak
Hat to the hat to the back and relax, you in the back of the 'Bach

See a bitch got more coins than a game room
So we ain't ever hatin' in TheShadeRoom
See I keep my sons in a playroom
So me and you ain't ever in the same room

I tell him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he eat the cookie he got good form
He know I don't ever cheat because I'm good to him
Might gotta have his baby, nurses yellin' push for him
You see I let him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he bite, he eat the cookie he got good form
He know that when I'm pullin' up I'm in a good foreign
I be like ooh he love me, ooh he love me, good form
Come on, come on, come on
I be like ooh he love me, ooh he love me, good form

I slick, slick drop the top like lip slips
So he tryna smash like when the whip flips
I hit licks just to floss with this wrist
And when I leave my bitches we all say, "Kiss kiss"
I'm in that new new De Larenta, tryna land Bugs Bunny
'Cause all I want is karats and some big drug money
I'm only loyal to the niggas that'll bust guns for me
The jig up, it's a stick up, money, the money

'Cause I be the baddie B, Barbie Tingz
Bangin' body B, everybody be on my D
Yo I gotta be in reality, suck a D if you doubted me
Back of the back, back of the back
Back of the back, back of the back
Who on Barbie D? Who on Barbie D? Everybody
Who you gotta see? Honestly, on my odyssey
I'm the baddest B, I don't even know how to speak
Hat to the hat to the back and relax, you in the back of the 'Bach

See a bitch get more press than a key pad
Before you suck me off, get a knee pad
See I pull the strings like a tea bag
I'm prolly with my jeweler playin' freeze tag

I tell him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he eat the cookie he got good form
He know I don't ever cheat because I'm good to him
Might gotta have his baby, nurses yellin' push for him
You see I let him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he bite, he eat the cookie he got good form
He know that when I'm pullin' up I'm in a good foreign
I be like ooh he love me, ooh he love me, good form
Come on, come on, come on
I be like ooh he love me, ooh he love me, good form
Come on
