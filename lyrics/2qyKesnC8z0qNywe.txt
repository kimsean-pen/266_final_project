Her face is a map of the world, is a map of the world
You can see she's a beautiful girl, she's a beautiful girl
And everything around her is a silver pool of light
People who surround her feel the benefit of it, it makes you calm

She holds you captivated in her palm
Suddenly I see
(Suddenly I see)
This is what I wanna be

Suddenly I see
(Suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me
(Suddenly I see)
This is what I wanna be
Suddenly I see
(Suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me

And I feel like walking the world, like walking the world
And you can hear she's a beautiful girl, she's a beautiful girl
She fills up every corner like she's born in black and white
Makes you feel warmer when you're trying to remember what you heard

She likes to leave you hanging on a wire
Suddenly I see
(Suddenly I see)
This is what I wanna be

Suddenly I see
(Suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me
(Suddenly I see)
This is what I wanna be
Suddenly I see
(Suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me

And she's taller than most and she's looking at me
I can see her eyes looking from the page of a magazine
She makes me feel like I could be a tower, big strong tower yeah
The power to be, the power to give, the power to see, yeah yeah
(Suddenly I see)
She got the power to be, the power to give, the power to see, yeah yeah
(Suddenly I see)
She got the power to be, the power to give, the power to see, yeah yeah yeah
(Suddenly I see)
She got the power to be, the power to give, the power to see, yeah yeah
(Suddenly I see)
She got the power to be, the power to give, the power to see, yeah yeah
Suddenly I see
(Suddenly I see)
This is what I wanna be
Suddenly I see
(Suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me
(Suddenly I see)
'Cause this is what I wanna be

Suddenly I see
(Suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me
(Suddenly I see)
Suddenly I see
(Suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me
(Suddenly I see)
Suddenly I see
(Suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me
