You thought you had me, didn't you?
When you lied to my face I could see the truth
Every step of the way, I knew
How you fooled me, boo
Guess you didn't know that

You were my favorite entertainer
I watch you, I laugh away, fuck with you
Don't you take me for a fool
In this game, I own the rules
You were my favorite entertainer
I watch you, I laugh away, fake it too
Don't you take me for a fool
I'ma show you thing or two

Never seen me coming
I will turn you down
When you need me the most
I will turn you
When you need me the most
I will turn you down
Never seen me coming
I will turn you down
When you need me the most
I will turn you
When you need me the most
I will turn you down

Thought that you were smarter
I'm ashamed for you
I knew it right away when you stopped loving me
It happened when your touch wasn't enough for me
Thought that you should know that

You were my favorite entertainer
I watch you, I laugh away, fuck with you
Don't you play me for a fool
In this game I own the rules
You were my favorite entertainer
I watch you, I laugh away, fake it too
Don't you play me for a fool
I'ma show you thing or two

Never seen me coming
I will turn you down
When you need me the most
I will turn you
When you need me the most
I will turn you down
Never seen me coming
I will turn you down
When you need me the most
I will turn you
When you need me the most
I will turn you down

Know it's harder to take
But let's face it
No one's playing no games
'Cause that's basic
I'm being straight up
I know a fake love when I see it anyway
I'ma turn you down, when you need me anyway
Anyway, anyway
(I know you need me the most)

Never seen me coming
I will turn you down
When you need me the most
I will turn you
When you need me the most
I will turn you down
Never seen me coming
I will turn you down
When you need me the most
I will turn you
When you need me the most
I will turn you down

I know you need me the most
The most, the most
(One more time)
