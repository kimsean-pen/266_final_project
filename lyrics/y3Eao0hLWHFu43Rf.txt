Walking sadly through the park
I hear crying in the darkness
And though I act like I cannot hear
The situation is very clear
A girl who's trying to tell her guy
The time has come that they say goodbye
And his answer tears my heart apart

Give me tonight
Then if you don't wanna stay
Girl I'll just forget you
You'll see I'm right
You won't get to go away
Love ain't gonna let you
Give me tonight

Walking with you through the park
Now it's my voice in the darkness
Just like the girl trying to tell her guy
I'm telling you we must say goodbye
I can't believe when I hear once more
The very words that were said before
Come from deep within your broken heart

Give me tonight
Then if you don't wanna stay
Girl I'll just forget you
You'll see I'm right
You won't get to go away
Love ain't gonna let you
Give me tonight Gimme Give me tonight
Then if you don't wanna stay
Girl I'll just forget you
You'll see I'm right
You won't get to go away
Love ain't gonna let you
Give me tonight
