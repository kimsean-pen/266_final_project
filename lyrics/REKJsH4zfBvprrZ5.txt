I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down
I feel my heart start to trembling
Whenever you're around

Ooh, baby, when I see your face
Mellow as the month of May
Oh, darling, I can't stand it
When you look at me that way

Hey, I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down
I feel my heart start to trembling
Whenever you're around

Ooh, darling, when you're near me
And you tenderly call my name
I know that my emotions
Are something I just can't tame
I just got to have you, baby

Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, yeah

I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down, a-tumbling down
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down, a-tumbling down
I just a-lose control
Down to my very soul
I get-a hot and cold
All over, all over, all over, all over

I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down, a-tumbling down
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down, a-tumbling down
A-tumbling down, a-tumbling down
A-tumbling down, tumbling down
