I wanna know
Since you've been gone
Have I been on
Your mind?
'Cause I know I was for a while

Late last night
I saw you out
For a moment I
Turned to stone
'Cause there's still something only we see

Don't talk
I'd have run to kiss your mouth
Is it me or
Just a dream that never dies?

There's a reason why
I never returned your calls
I wish I could forget it all
But I never returned your calls
'Cause I'd fall in again

We're leaving here
We're on the run
The time has come
I don't hear no alarms
Fall asleep in my arms

A lover's game
Is never fair
But I still care
And I know you do too
'Cause there's a part of me that's you

Don't talk
I'd have run to kiss your mouth
Is it me or
Just a dream that never dies?

There's a reason why
I never returned your calls
I wish I could forget it all
But I never returned your calls
'Cause I'd fall in again

I still find parts of you
In the corners of my bedroom
Someday comes too soon
The radio plays our favourite tune again

There's a reason why
I never returned your calls
I wish I could forget it all
But I never returned your calls
'Cause I'd fall in again
