Don't like the look of this old town
What goes up must come down
Character is lost and found
On unfamiliar playing ground

Get out of my world
(What in the world)

Shoeboxed around the rifle range
Have all your functions rearranged
Your mind and body gagged and bound
On a new familiar playing ground
The ordinary will ignore
Whatever they canot explain
As if--nothing ever happened
And everything remained the same again

(What in the world)
What in the world
(What in the world)
Get, get out of my world
(What in the world)
Get out of my world...
(What in the world)

Get up, get out, get out of my world (6x)

Open your mouth now!

Secret signs and knowing looks
These sunny days will cook the books
Happy to take the misery
This mortal life can bring to me
Don't like the look of this town
What goes up must come down
Character is lost and found
On unfamiliar playing ground

(What in the world)
What in my world
(What in the world)
What in...
(What in the world)
Get out, get out, get out of my world
(What in the world)

Palaces, barricades, threats, meet promises (8x)
