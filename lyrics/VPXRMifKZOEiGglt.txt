there ain't nothing beyond hope(x2)
i've been thrashed by the hope of your body
i've been thrashed by the hope of your eyes
you looked me square in the eyes
you said don't take but one thing to be your truth(x2)
when I'm back on the top again(x2)
that is the truth
that is your truth
there ain't nothing beyond truth
i've been thrashed by the truth of your body
i've been thrashed by the truth of your eyes
you looked me square in the eyes
you said don't take but one thing to be your truth(x2)
when I'm back on the top again(x2)
that is the truth(x3)
