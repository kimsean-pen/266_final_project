Get lucky, to get lucky, to get lucky

Like the legend of the phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning?
The force of love beginning

We've come too far to give up who we are
So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars

She's up all night 'til the sun,
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun,
I'm up all night to get lucky
We're up all night 'til the sun,
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky

The present has no ribbon
Your gift keeps on giving
What is this I'm feeling?
If you wanna leave, I'm with it

We've come too far to give up who we are
So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars

She's up all night 'til the sun,
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky
We're up all night 'til the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get
we're up all night to get
We're up all night to get
we're up all night to get lucky

She's up all night 'til the sun,
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky
We're up all night 'til the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky

She's up all night 'til the sun,
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky
We're up all night 'til the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky,
we're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
we're up all night to get lucky
Up all night to get
Up all night to get lucky
Up all night to get
Up all night to get lucky
