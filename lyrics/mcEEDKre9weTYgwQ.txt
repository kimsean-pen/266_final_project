Deeper shades of red descending
Smear our names, the stains unending

Turn forgiveness
Break the lens distorted
Crush the infidel and turn about
Famine in our hearts, bring up the silence louder
Eradicate the lungs and take us higher

These are the wonders at your feet

Weighed upon a wider scale
Afraid to see what takes us down

Sing destruction, sing of unfullfillment
Search abandoned, let the blood be fevered
Ridden of the self provided things get easier
Ignite our minds and let's burn brighter

These are the wonders at your feet
