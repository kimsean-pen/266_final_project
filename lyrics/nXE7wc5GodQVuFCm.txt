Can't run away from love if yo cannot feel
Everything falls apart in a tragedy
I am so far away from gone
I just wanna be here
Everyone forms apart in my symphony

Can you feel this in your heart
Can you take it to your soul
I don't want you to pretend
I don't wanna' be alone

Feels like I'm torn apart
And I cannot bleed
Caught in the web you made
This just cant be real
I am so far away from gone
I just wanna be here
Everyone falls apart in this tragedy

Can you feel this in your heart
Can you take it to your soul
I don't want you to pretend
I don't wanna' be alone

Can you feel this in your heart
Can you take it to your soul
I don't want you to pretend
I don't wanna' be alone

I don't wanna' be alone
Everyday I'll live through this alone
Inside I've changed
Everyday I don't wanna' be alone

Can you feel this in your heart
Can you take it to your soul
I don't want you to pretend
I don't wanna' be alone

Can you feel this in your heart
Can you take it to your soul
I don't want you to pretend
I don't wanna' be alone

Inside I've changed
Everyday I'll live through this
Inside I've changed
Everyday I'll live through this alone

I don't wanna' be alone
I don't wanna' be alone
