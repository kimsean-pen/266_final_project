Had this dream where
A girl kissed your mouth
She had blue lips
And I watched how you felt
Still, I could only love you

Remember that night
We were too stoned to drive
I panicked
In the passenger side
The world felt like it slowed down

But I'd like it, if it slowed down with you, my love
Would come through
And fall asleep with you
And you could love me the same, ooh
You could love me the same, ooh
You could love me the same

California
Doesn't smell like home
Like Arizona
After warm thunderstorms
And I wish that I were there with you

Sometimes I picture
My home against yours
'Til they meet up
And my home becomes yours
'Cause I'd like to always be with you

And I'd like it
If you were there with me too, my love
I'd be there
To fall asleep with you
And you could love me the same, ooh
You could love me the same, ooh
You could love me the same

You could love me the same
You could love me the same
