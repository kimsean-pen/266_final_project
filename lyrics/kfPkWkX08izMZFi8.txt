When I lay in your arms you fit me perfectly
My mind's high maintenance you say that I'm worthy

I don't need Couture it's all on the floor
It don't mean nothing as long as I'm yours
When I get anxious or feel insecure
I wanna Wear Your Love
I wanna Wear Your Love

So come dress me up in the night (In the night)
Look at me through your diamond eyes (Diamond eyes)
You give me what money can't buy
I wanna Wear Your Love

Dress me dress me up
All I wanna do is Wear Your Love
Dress me dress me up all I wanna do

It made me feel like I was made for somebody

When I get anxious or feel insecure
