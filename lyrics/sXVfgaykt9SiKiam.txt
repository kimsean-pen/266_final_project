I ran across cyanide plains
Mind like a prison cell
But feet untethered and sane

I wondered out, homeless and sad
No thought of where I go
Or how I ever get back

There is an answer
I haven't found it
But I will keep dancing till I do
uh, uh, uh

I boggied down gargoyle streets
Searching in every face,
For something I could believe
I never knew what Congress is
I wanna feel the breath of a force I can not ex? lain

There is an answer
I haven't found it
But I will keep dancing till I do
uh, uh, uh
Dance for you
Dance for you
Dance for you

There is an answer
I haven't found it
But I will kee? dancing till I do
Dance for you
Dance for you
Dance for you
Dance for you
Dance for you
Dance for you
Dance for you
Dance for you
Dance for you
Dance for you
Dance for you
