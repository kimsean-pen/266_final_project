I'm standing in the desert
I have nothing
I'm scared
You can't run
Save me
Save me
Save me

Somebody save me
Somebody save me
Somebody save me
Somebody save me
Somebody save me
Somebody save me
Somebody save me
Somebody save me

Save me, save me, save me
Save me, save me, save me
Save me, save me, save me
Save me, save me, save me
Save me, save me, save me
Save me, save me, save me
Save me, save me, save me
Save me, save me, save me

Somebody save me from myself
Somebody bring me from my shelf
Somebody wake me from this spell
Show me how to love again

Somebody save me from myself
Somebody bring me from my shelf
Somebody wake me from this spell
Show me how to love again

Somebody save me
Somebody save me
Somebody save me
Somebody save me

Somebody save me from myself
Somebody bring me from my shelf
Somebody wake me from this spell
Show me how to love again

Somebody save me from myself
Somebody bring me from my shelf
Somebody wake me from this spell
Show me how to love again

Somebody save me
Somebody save me
Somebody save me
Somebody save me

I'm standing in the desert
Somebody save me
I have nothing
Somebody save me
I'm scared
Somebody save me
I turn around and see faces
They all cry out
You can't run
But I want to run, I wanna run away from myself
And run away from it all
This storm just swallowed me
Save me
