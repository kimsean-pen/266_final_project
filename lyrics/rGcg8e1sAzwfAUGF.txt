Inequity solace,
in your driven sate.
Seize your right to earn the same.
She wants it.
How long must we wait,
before they take our side?
Sordid Practice,
engine overheated.
There's no way to cool.
Turned up on your side,
the one that you choose.
Why should they mind,
scared of what your thinking.

A strong resistant.

Sunday feeling,
under weight of what's to come.
Tired of living under thumb.
She wonders,
why did you say what you said.
Silently living is death.
Shout him down,
it's worth it,
no compromises on this.

Turned up on your side,
the one that you choose.
Why should they mind,
scared of what your thinking.
Scared of what your thinking.

She wonders,
How long, have we been senseless.
So tired and pensive.
Instead of stand up,
stand to the side.

Feel a strong resistant.
