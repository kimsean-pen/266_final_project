Fear in me so deep
it gets the best of me
In the fear I fall
here it comes face to face with me
Here I stand hold back so no one can see
I feel these wounds
step down
step down
step down.
(am I) Breaking
Breaking
Down
Can I break away
Push me away
make me fall
Just to see
another side of me
Push me away
you can see
what I see
the other side of me
Fall back on me
and I'll be the strength I need
to save me now
just come face to face with me
stay in place you'll be the first to see
me heal these wounds
step down
step down
step down
down
I'm not breaking
breaking
down
can I break away
push me away
make me fall
just to see another side of me
push me away you can see
what I see
the other side of me
side of me
Go!
Fall
can I break away
push me away,
make me fall
just to see another side of me
push me away you can see
what I see
the other side of me
No one can see
anything on the other side of me
I walk
I crawl
loosing everything and waiting for the downfall
No one can see everything
on the other side of me
I walk
I crawl
loosing everything on the
downfall
Fall.
