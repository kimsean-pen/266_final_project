Oh love, you know I swear I saw you in the night again
Oh love, 'cause since you left I haven't drawn a single breath
Maybe it's just a daydream
'Cause I've been feeling like I'm floating above the rooms I'm in
Wake up, what a night
The perfect night to sink into the floor and die
It's no love, but close enough
It's only fun but just because your clothes are off
And oh love, I'm mostly numb
I'm lonely 'cause you know you were my only one
You should know I don't love you
Don't think that I don't know
People come and go
But now I feel I'm on the hemisphere alone
Oh love, the things you said still echo on inside my head
Maybe it's just a daydream
'Cause I've been feeling like I'm floating above the rooms I'm in
Wake up, what a night
The perfect night to sink into the floor and die
It's no love, but close enough
It's only fun but just because your clothes are off
And oh love, I'm mostly numb
I'm lonely 'cause you know you were my only one
It's no love, but close enough
It's only fun but just because your clothes are off
And oh love, I'm mostly numb
I'm lonely 'cause you know you were my only one
