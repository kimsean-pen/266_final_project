You're rushing for a time that you don't know
Curious of what your feelings are you go

Losing sight of that familiar touch you know
Sinking into unknown beauty for a day
Living everything as it comes and goes
The only times you know have passed away

Now you're looking back where everything seems here
Scared of letting all that comfort disappear
