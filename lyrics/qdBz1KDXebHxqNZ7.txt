Punishment for intolerance
so entertain us when you're still
able to perform
i'm sorry to admit

that i won't be arround
when the world you created
will colapse and drown
colapse

and drown
back to the crypts, nothing will last
we'll all fade away in one single blast
out from the dust, machines arise
one second lef to live
then will open your eyes
i can't find shelter in this world
i'm searching for another world
where i feel safe
