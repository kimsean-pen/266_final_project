One day in spring, it was gym class
That was the only class Shane passed

He was scaling the rope
Some cool kid cracked a joke
Oh man, he was mad, it was like his ears smoked

And I saw Shane, and everyone was pushing him
And you could really feel his pain
And then before you knew it
All of a sudden there were these flames
A fire started in the school
That took a hundred lives away

Life is real tough when your parents
Don't want you
Life can be tough when your girlfriend
Don't want you

Daisy was his last hope
But she thought Shane a big joke
"Well we'll see who's the big joke when
That school goes up in smoke!"
