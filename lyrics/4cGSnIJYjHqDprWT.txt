Oh in New York sometimes
Oh we just fall apart
But you're the alibi that I know by heart

I know who you are and I won't leave you
An honest stare, come here to see through
'Cause there's me and there's you
Like there's false and there's true
I know who you are and I won't leave you
An honest stare, come here to see through
'Cause there's me and there's you
Like there's false and there's true

Oh in New York sometimes
We try to follow through
But there's a rising tide
Rolling over you
So tell me where I stand
And what I got into
I wanna be the sand
Living under you

I know who you are and I won't leave you
An honest stare, come here to see through
'Cause there's me and there's you
Like there's false and there's true
I know who you are and I won't leave you
An honest stare, come here to see through
'Cause there's me and there's you
Like there's false and there's true

Suddenly I remember
I've been here before
Your lines are falling for me
And there's a crack in everything
Then I remember
I've been here before
Your lines are falling for me
And there's a crack in everything

I know who you are and I won't leave you
An honest stare, come here to see through
'Cause there's me and there's you
Like there's false and there's true
I know who you are and I won't leave you
An honest stare, come here to see through
'Cause there's me and there's you
Like there's false and there's true
