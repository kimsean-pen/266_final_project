Do you worry bout everything
Afraid you ain't got the tight game
Do you feel just a little too plain
Compare yourself to whats his name

So you jump through a gang of rings
Bloody murder as we point the way
Huffin' and puffin' all day
A trife aristocratic game

Find love in a special way
Hustle called day to day
You don't have to lose the game (have heart like a tangerine)
You don't have to lose the game (have heart like a tangerine)

And we bite with stolen teeth
Clattering in finery
Baseness glimmers all day - we're going
Crazy over shiny things

Jokers in a marketplace
Punish virtues and forgive mistakes
Command yourself or obey
Damaged goods around the way

Find love in a special way
Hustle called day to day
You don't have to lose the game (have heart like a tangerine)
You don; t have to lose the game (have heart like a tangerine)

Find love in a special way
Hustle called day to day
You don't have to lose the game (have heart like a tangerine)
You don; t have to lose the game (have heart like a tangerine)

Find love in a special way
Hustle called day to day
You don't have to lose the game (have heart like a tangerine)
You don't have to lose the game (have heart like a tangerine)
