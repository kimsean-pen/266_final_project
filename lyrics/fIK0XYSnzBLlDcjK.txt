You had fun but you couldn't get him out of the car
I guess mama's boy's only go so far
You went in and put a record on
To make it sound like someone was home
And thanked yourself for pouring yourself a drink

You try to figure out and laugh yourself to the showers
Burn yourself alive and join the monster squad
They say in this place you can reinvent yourself

Well, you've done it again, Virginia
Made another masterpiece while I was dreaming
How does it feel to feel like you?
Brilliant sugar, brilliant sugar, brilliant sugar, turn over

A cool, tall, drink of water is all you ever wanted to be
And if you had another wish to wish you'd be fun and moving
But you can't talk to people, right? You can't tell a story
You're tall, you're long legged and your heart's full of liquor
Me and everybody are just ice in a glass

Try to figure out and laugh yourself to the showers
Burn yourself alive and join the monster squad
They say in this place you can reinvent yourself

Well, you've done it again, Virginia
Made another masterpiece while I was dreaming
How does it feel to feel like you?
Brilliant sugar, brilliant sugar, brilliant sugar, turn over

Well, you've done it again, Virginia
Made another masterpiece while I was dreaming
How does it feel to feel like you?
Brilliant sugar, brilliant sugar, brilliant sugar, turn over
