Hope you guys like it. Woah, woah, woah.

Here is my new song
and it didn't take long.
It's not a cover.
I hope you won't bother.

It's not karaoke
I'm keeping it low-key.
Well I'm not a psychic
but I hope that you like it.

Here it goes, now
don't make me nervous.
'Cause all I've got is a few random verses.
I hope it gets you under the surface.
I'm tryin' my best cause you really deserve it.

Oooo, I wanna live for the moments.
That are gone before we're thinkin' about them.
I'm singin' this cause we'd be nothin' without them
and this is my anthem, yeah.

Oooo, I wanna live for the feelings.
That can live in this life for meaning.
I'm singin' this cause we'd be nothin' with them
and this is my anthem, yeah.

Maybe it's tacky
this song makes me happy.
If you sing it with me
possibly maybe.

If you think it's cheesy
you're singin' off key
it won't matter to me
'cause I'm feeling sunny.

Here it goes, now
don't ya get nervous.
'Cause all we've got is a few random verses.
I know it'll get you under the surface.
You can't go wrong 'cause nobody's perfect.

Oooo, I wanna live for the moments.
That are gone before we're thinkin' about them.
I'm singin' this cause we'd be nothin' without them.
And this is my anthem, yeah.

That can live in this life for meaning.
