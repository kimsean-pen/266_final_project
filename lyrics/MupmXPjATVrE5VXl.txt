Look at you
I don't know how long it's been
Since you looked at me
At least an hour since then
Once again, I demand that you put down your pen

I want you
I won't do everything that made you
I want you
Let's go, or I'll trade your paintings for the door
I won't do everything that made me love you goes or
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore

Look at you
Aren't you ashamed of that hurt
Oh, won't you look at me?
I was a fan of your work
Yet again, I demand that you put down your pen

I want you
I won't do everything that made you
I want you
Let's go, or I'll trade your paintings for the door
I want you
I won't do everything that made me love you goes or
I can't love you anymore

I left your paintings on your floor
I left your paintings on your floor
I left your paintings on the floor
'Cause I can't love you

I want you
I won't do everything that made you
I want you
Once more I trade your paintings towards the door
I want you
I won't do everything that made me love you goes or
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore
