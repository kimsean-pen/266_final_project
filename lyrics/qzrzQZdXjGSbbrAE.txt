Further along, farther away.
Lamenting the distance prevents day to day presence
The people, body and mind
But heart remains constant no passage of time
Could spoil the spirit passing through
Even walls ten-thick to break into.
They'd all crumble.
They'd all crumble with time.
I'll defend the fort that's battered through
Buttresses that you've been looking to
You would crumble.
You would crumble inside.
Lately I feel we're speaking in tongues
Are you starting to feel my smoke in your lungs?
And I'm swearing on contract when it's not signed.
I'm swearing that safeties in my own mind.
Could spoil the spirit passing through
Even walls ten-thick to break into.
They'd all crumble.
They'd all crumble with time.
I'll defend the fort that's battered through
Buttresses that you've been looking to
You would crumble.
You would crumble inside.
