Replace all you know
My apology's enough
But it's all in your head
Fiction based off truths
You made me take you, guide you
You are the language
Ever flowing
Ever echoing
You are
All will be for love you know
My dear, you know
Patience cause it's wall subsides
And in time
All will be clear
And the truth is
I couldn't love you more than I have come to know
And this love is mine, is bound to...
I've watched you grow
You are the perceiver, the perceived, the parable
The never ending end
You are the infinite
You are the finite
You are
