Well, in the heat of the night
You went and blackened my eye
Oh I'm back
I'm back
I'm back
And I'm coming your way

Well now I'm supercharged
Might just explode in your face
Oh I'm black
I'm black
I'm black
And I'm primed for hate

Knock 'em dead kid
(Knock 'em dead)
Well knock 'em dead kid
(Knock 'em dead)
Oh, it's a TKO
The blade is red kid
(Knock 'em dead)
Knock 'em dead kid
(Knock 'em dead)

On a star-spangled fight
I heard a steel-belted scream
Oh I'm black
I'm black
I'm black
Another sidewalk's bloody dream
I heard sirens whine
My blood turned to freeze
You'll see the red in my eyes
You're gonna take my disease

Knock 'em dead kid
(Knock 'em dead)
Knock 'em dead kid
(Knock 'em dead)
Oh it's a TKO
The blade is red kid
(Knock 'em dead)
Well, knock 'em dead kid
(Knock 'em dead)

(Solo)

Na na na na na
Knock 'em dead kid
(Knock 'em dead)
Well knock 'em dead kid
(Knock 'em dead)
Now it's a one man fight
His blood is red kid
(Knock 'em dead)
Knock 'em dead kid
(Knock 'em dead)

Knock 'em
Knock 'em
Knock 'em
Knock... (scream)
Dead kid!
