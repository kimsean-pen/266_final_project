No man's and island when he's had this conversation
No man's a forest even if he tried to be one
I've seen your insights, it's colourful
But you're not an island even if you try to be one with me
If i had a problem then so did you
It slows to the ocean and solitude
Oh i swear
Did you care for me
Oh i swear
Did you care for me
Oh I swear
Did you care for me
Ooooh
And a picture frame wouldn't help me now
Need a steady hand
Intentions clouded on you
So I'm not a forest even if I thought I was on with you
'Cause you're not an angel even if you're close
We had a problem so miniscule
It slows to the ocean and solitude
Oh i swear
Did you care for me
Ooooh
