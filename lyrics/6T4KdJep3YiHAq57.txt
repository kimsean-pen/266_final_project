A-ha!
A-ha!
A-ha!

Eat, sleep and breathe it, you're full of the stuff
Go back, get tied up tight
Wheat meat, dairy free tea total happy clappy high on life
You should try it
You should know (You should know) x2

go on while no one's looking
A-ha!
Caught you now
Caught your red handed in the biscuit tin

Cost you to keep me quiet
A-ha!

La la la la...
Golden boy boots, pocket pedestal, making sharp smart moves
Plastic, tin can, paper, separated
Busy bee wave, wave save the planet flag

But sneaky in suburbia
A-ha!
Candid camera
the line and sinker for the four-wheel drive
Cost you to keep me quiet

Keep me quiet (keep me quiet)
La la la la ...

Aaaaah...
Nicest sweetest, utmost in everything
It's so charming, very charming
Well, reckon play the fool no one's ill at ease
And put the deepest Swiss bank trust in you
No one saw it coming
Aaaaah...
Cost you to keep me quiet
A-ha!
Lalala...
Hey!
