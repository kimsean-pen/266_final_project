Oh, in the heat of the night
Yeah, when things ain't goin' right
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you will remember me

I came along to see your face
But the only thing I got from you
Was telling me it's fantasy
That you would always be with me
I can tell you that's it's true
I can tell you that's it's true (Oh, yes, it's true)
I'm waiting here
But it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
But it's alright with me, you better believe me now

I guess it's like a mountainside
You've got to climb it to the top
Floating in a sea of dreams
The only thing that you can see
Is the view above the clouds
Is the view above the clouds (Above the clouds)
I'm waiting here
But it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Still it's alright with me, you better believe me now
