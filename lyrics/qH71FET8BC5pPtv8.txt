I'm gonna pull you in close
Gonna wrap you up tight
Gonna play with the braids
That you came here with tonight
I'm gonna hold your face
And toast the snow that fell
Because friends don't waste wine
When there's words to sell

I feel like love is in the kitchen
with a culinary eye
I think he's making something special
and I'm smart enough to try
If you don't trust yourself
For at least one minute each day
Well you should trust in this, girl
'Cause loving is coming our way

If you can fix me up, girl
We'll go a long way
If you can fix me up, girl
We'll go a long way

I'll stand by all this drinking if it helps me through these days (Take my love in real small doses)
It takes a long time just to get this all straight (Take my love in real small doses)
I'll showcase on Route 7 when I find the right place (Take my love in real small doses)
It takes a long time just to get this all straight (Take my love in real small doses)
In my mind
This is my free-time

Because friends don't waste wine
When there's words to sell

If you can fix me up, girl
We'll go a long way

I'll stand by all this drinking if it helps me through these days (Take my love in real small doses)
I spent a long time corresponding in my own way (Take my love in real small doses)
I'll showcase on Route 7 when I find the right place (Take my love in real small doses)
It takes a long time just to get this all straight (Take my love in real small doses)
In my mind
This is my free-time
To let it all away

Spend it all today

It took time
Then I found you
