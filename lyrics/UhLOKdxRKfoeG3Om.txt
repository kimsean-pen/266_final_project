Through shattered glass there's headlights
I swear I died and came back to life
Maybe as someone else
For better, for worse, I'm forever changed
Abandoned lives on stereo
Talking all night about what they know
But maybe this horror show
Advice is the price that the people pay

Through shattered glass I see it coming
I can't hold back, my body's aching
For this
For this

You ain't got no right, you ain't got no right
You are not my saviour
Wake me up tonight, wake me up tonight
Baby I'm in danger
You are not my ride, you are not my ride
I won't go gently
I don't like you, I don't want to
I'll remind you

You won't win this fight, you won't win this fight
I'm the wrong girl on the wrong night
Visions haunt my mind, visions haunt my mind
Wild dreams or an omen?
You ain't got no right, you ain't got no right
So don't coming knocking with your night moves
My resistance is your weakness

Vibrations soar through my bones
Am I a bird now? Am I atoned?
Maybe, or something else
The purr of the flames, I can't get away
Unnatural world with no echo
Have I become immaterial?
Maybe, my blood still flows
For better, for worse, I'm forever changed

You ain't got no right, you ain't got no right
You are not my saviour
Wake me up tonight, wake me up tonight
Baby I'm in danger
You are not my ride, you are not my ride
I won't go gently
I don't like you, I don't want to
I'll remind you

You won't win this fight, you won't win this fight
I'm the wrong girl on the wrong night
Visions haunt my mind, visions haunt my mind
Wild dreams or an omen?
You ain't got no right, you ain't got no right
So don't coming knocking with your night moves
My resistance is your weakness

Don't coming knocking with your night moves
My resistance is your weakness
Don't coming knocking with your night moves
My resistance is your weakness
Don't coming knocking with your night moves
My resistance is your weakness
Don't coming knocking with your night moves
My resistance is your weakness
Don't coming knocking with your night moves
My resistance is your weakness
Don't coming knocking with your night moves
My resistance is your weakness
Don't coming knocking with your night moves
My resistance is your weakness
Don't coming knocking with your night moves
My resistance is your weakness
Don't coming knocking with your night moves
My resistance is your weakness
Don't coming knocking with your night moves
My resistance is your weakness
Don't coming knocking with your night moves
My resistance is your weakness
Don't coming knocking with your night moves
My resistance is your weakness
