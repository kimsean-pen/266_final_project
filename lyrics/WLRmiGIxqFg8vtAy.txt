Don't leave the door ajar
Don't walk away
Don't leave me in the dark

You think you know me well
It makes me laugh
'Cause I don't know myself

This killer on the run
He steals from me a song
He'll catch me off my guard
He likes me when I'm down
And when I'm sad
Fallen man
Fallen man

It's always me alone
That hears the noise
'Cause it's my inner voice

So stay inside your hole
We'll hide away
Before I lose control

This killer on the run
He steals from me a song
He'll catch me off my guard
He likes me when I'm down
And when I'm sad
Fallen man
Fallen man

This killer on the run
He steals from me a song
And I can say I know him well
And so can he, because it's me
He is me
He is me
