I don't believe in the apocalypse
I don't believe in the end of time
I don't believe in the solar eclipse
I don't believe in valentines

I don't believe I asked opinion
I don't believe I stretched the truth
I am not looking for a bargain
All I really believe in is you

I don't believe in everything I've read
I don't believe in promises
I don't believe in compromising
My own beliefs inside my head

I don't believe I asked opinion
I don't believe I stretched the truth
I am not looking for a bargain
All I really believe in is you

I don't believe I asked opinion
I don't believe I stretched the truth
I am not looking for a bargain
All I really believe in is you
