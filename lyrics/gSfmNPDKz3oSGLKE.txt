Make up your mind
And I'll make up mine.
Don't worry about me
I'll be fine.
Those words that you said to me
Why wasn't I listening?
I wish I hadn't met you at all.
I started thinking
I'll sit back and relax and wait for the morning.
We'll wake up, we'll make up
And do this for the last time
We'll wake up, we'll make up
And do this for the last time
If we break up, we'll wind up
Losing both of our minds
So wake up, lets make up
And do this for the last time.

Make up your mind
And I'll make up mine
Don't worry about me
I'll be fine (I'll be fine)
The last time you yelled at me
I swore that I heard you say
I wish I hadn't met you at all
I started thinking
I'll sit back and relax and wait for the morning

We'll wake up, we'll make up
And do this for the last time
We'll wake up, we'll make up
And do this for the last time
If we break up, we'll wind up
Losing both of our minds
So wake up, lets make up
And do this for the last time
When will we make up?
Will we break up?
lets wake up, lets wake up, lets wake up
Yeah

Make up your mind
And I'll make up mine
Don't worry about me
I'll be fine
Those words that you said to me
Why wasn't I listening?
I wish I hadn't met you all
I started thinking

We'll wake up, We'll make up
And do this for the last time
We'll wake up, we'll make up
And do this for the last time
If we break up, we'll wind up
Losing both of our minds
So wake up, lets make up
And do this for the last time (2X)
Lets wake up, lets make up
And do this for the last time
If we break up, we'll wind up
Losing both of our minds
Lets wake up, lets make up
