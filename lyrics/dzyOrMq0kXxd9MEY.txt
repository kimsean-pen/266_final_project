Yeah, touche

She was straight from hell
But you never could tell '
Cause you were blinded by her light
She could crack your brain
With magic pain
And turn a paler shade of white

Well I was on the free
Just me and me
And just about to sail
When I heard the voice
Said you got a choice
The hammer or the nail

You'll be riding
You'll be riding on the Gypsy
On the Gypsy

Well I rolled the bones
To see who'd own
My mind and what's within
And it's a given rule
That we're all fools
But need to have a little sin

So I'm riding
I've been riding on the Gypsy
On the Gypsy Queen

Well she was straight from hell
But you never could tell
That you were blinded by the light
So she cracked my brain
With a magic pain
And turned my left around to right, right

So I'm riding
I'm still riding
Yes I'm riding on, on the Gypsy
On the Gypsy Queen
She's mean
riding on the Gypsy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, on the Queen
