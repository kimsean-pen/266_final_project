Keep moving down the line,
What's sitting here is mine
You've taken far too long,
Go back where you belong
This place is not for the weak,
This place is not for the weak

They've all been begging for the truth,
It's over now (it's over now)

We gave our lives for this,
It's all we have,
It's all we'll ever know
We sacrificed for this,
When it's said and done
We'll have our scars to show

I am destruction,
You'll never be the death of me
You are deception,
I am the one that you betray
We gave our lives for this,
It's all we have,
It's all we'll ever know
We sacrificed for this,
When it's said and done
We'll have our scars to show,
We'll have our scars to show
From now 'till the end
From now until the end

It's set in stone
Now there's no turning back
We'll stand our ground,
We are unbroken

It's set in stone
Now there's no turning back
We'll stand our ground,
We are unbroken
It's set in stone
Now there's no turning back
We'll stand our ground,
We are unbroken

We are unbroken
We are unbroken
We are unbroken
