Information overload
Rains are melting down
What is right and what is wrong
Who really owes the crown

Too many words of fate
Cover up the truth that lies
Confusion.
Delusion
The devil in disguise

Under your bed you crawl
And in the sleep you fall

Dream about the pouring rain
That makes you feel alive
Dream about the shining light
Your power to survive
You will always wait
You wait until you're home
This is above you always roam

You're lost but you're never alone
And it's time to choose your side
There's the one with the blowing eyes
Don't you dare to trust his lies
You find the right solution
By listening to your heart
Decision.
Your vision
Will make you depart

Under your bed you crawl
And in the sleep you fall

Dream about the pouring rain
That makes you feel alive
Dream about the shining light
Your power to survive
You will always wait
You wait until you're home
This is above you always roam

Under your bed you crawl
And in the sleep you fall

Dream about the pouring rain
That makes you feel alive
Dream about the shining light
Your power to survive
You will always wait
You wait until you're home
This is above you always roam

You roam
You roam
