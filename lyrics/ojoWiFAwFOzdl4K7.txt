He's my religion,
I pray he never go.
If his love had a description,
it'd be the secret to my soul.
Ohhh, I look to him with reverence.
Ohhh, I'm kneeling at his presence.
Hallelujah
(you're my scripture) ohhhhhh
Hallelujah
(you're my scripture)
Excuse me while I worship;
Take me pride away.
I'll make a confession;
Just tell me what to say, yeah.
Here's my commandment
that I will never break.
Ohhh no weapon formed, but his skin
smoothly penetrate.
Ohhh, I look to him in reverence.
Ohhh, I'm kneeling at his presence.
Ohhh, with him I know it's servant. Ohhhh
Let me earn his blessing.
Hallelujah
(you are my scripture Ohhhh)
Hallelujah
(hallelujah, you are my scripture, you-u-u-uuuuu)
Hallelujah
And nobody tell me nothing but you're my scripture.
Can't nobody hold me down cause you're my scripture.
Hallelujah
(ohhh, you're my scripture, you areeeeeeee)
Can't nobody hold me down like you do.
I pray you never leave, it's mean for you.
You know that I can't live without you.
So keep your word cause to me it's true.
Hallelujah
(you are my scripture)
Hallelujah
(you are my scripture, you are my scripture)
