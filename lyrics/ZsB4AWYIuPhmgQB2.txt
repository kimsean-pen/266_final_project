All the things we've done
It's like we're living on the run
We never took the easy way
I'll tell you that this life ain't free

Why can't we just
Eat and drink like kings
We never took a like to fancy things
We never took the easy way
Our guns are feeling hot today

Why can't we just
Say what we want to say

Oh, oh, oh
I can never let you go
Don't you ever let me go
We're close I can feel it

Oh, oh, oh
I can never let this go
Nothing's ever set in stone
We're stuck on believing

Oh, we're having a real good time
Oh, oh, oh
Am I ever gonna see it?
The only the place that I'll ever want to be is here

All the ships we've sunk
Well it's close, close enough
We never took the easy way
We're moving like a hurricane

Why can't we just
Oh, you're living in the city
And it shows
We're eating like an alley cat

It stays the same
If we reset this stage
Will we start to go?

Oh, oh, oh
I can never let you go
Don't you ever let me go
We're close I can feel it

Oh, oh, oh
I can never let this go
Nothing's ever set in stone
We're stuck on believing

Oh, oh, oh
We're having a real good time
(A real good time)

Oh, oh, oh
Am I ever gonna see it?
The only the place that I'll ever want to be is here

I don't know where these birds have flown
But I think we'll stay here
We'll call you out on the radio so clear

Oooooooh, aaaaaahhh

Oh, oh, oh
I can never let you go
Don't you ever let me go
We're close I can feel it

Oh, oh, oh
I can never let this go
Nothing's ever set in stone
We're stuck on believing

Oh, oh, oh
We're having a real good time
(A real good time)

Oh, oh, oh
Am I ever gonna see it?
The only the place that I'll ever want to be is here
