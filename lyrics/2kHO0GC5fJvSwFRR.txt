The sun don't shine, the moon dont move the tides, to wash me clean,
Sun dont shine, the moon dont move the tides, to wash me clean,
Why so unforgiving and why so cold, been a long time crossing bridge of sighs,
Cold wind blows,
The gods look down in anger,
On this poor child,
Cold wind blows,
And gods look down in anger,
On this poor child,
Why so unforgiving and why so cold,
Been a long time crossing bridge of sighs.
