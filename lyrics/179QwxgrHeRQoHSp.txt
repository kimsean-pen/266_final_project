The spacecraft.was a long way from home.
I thought it might be a good idea, just after Saturn,
to have them take one last glance homeward.
From Saturn,
the earth would appear too small for voyager to make out any details.
Our planet would be just a. point of light, a lonely pixel
hardly distinguishable from any
other points of light voyager would see;
nearby planets, far off suns
but precisely because of the obscurity of our world thus revealed...
such a picture might be worth having.
It has been well understood by the
scientists and philosophers of classical antiquity
that the earth is just a mere point...
in a vast...
encompassing...
cosmos.
