Tongue tied, I lied
If I said I didn't want you.
A moment like a sunrise,
And your eyes shine like the morning sun.

When you're here, I'm alive
I want you now tonight.
Show you love, all the time
I want you now tonight.


She don't believe
I don't think she wants to
She's not gonna fall for
Anything but love.
Heart on the nightlight
Tells me she's alright
She's making time for
Anything but love.

Common down,
And I want one
So hold tight 'cause
I could be the one.
Yeah, I fall first
Just to show you
That I don't want

Anything but love///

You stopped my heart,
Girl I'm just being honest.
What you got, they all want,
In a contest girl it's like night and day.

When you're here, I'm alive
I want you now tonight.
Show you love, all the time
I want you now tonight.

(CHORUS x2)
