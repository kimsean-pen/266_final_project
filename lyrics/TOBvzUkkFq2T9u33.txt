Just like the sun went down at night
You know your love doesn't shine on me anymore
I lie amongst the things we shared
Hoping I'd forget those things were yours

Something here's not right
You notice it
Something here I'm frightened of
Aren't you the one that I've been thinking of all along?

Better, I'm better for it

It wasn't always wrong, you and I
Somewhere I lost your love
Deciding if I can continue on
Knowing that the heart has lost its love

Something here's not right
You notice it
Something here I'm frightened of
Aren't you the one that I've been thinking of all along?

Better, I'm better for it

Your not the only one howling in the night
Your not the only one begging for the light
Your not the only one howling in the night
Your not the only one

Better, I'm better for it
