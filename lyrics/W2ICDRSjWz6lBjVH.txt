I worry, I wonder all the time, why worry?
It's killing me, forget about it

I whisper, remember what she did, don't miss her
Set me free, she won't allow it

Angry and gone
And the list goes on and on
If it's love I will defer
I'm being lost being with her

I can't move on, I can't take it
(Aah)
She, she says we won't make it now
I can't move on, I can't take it
(Aah)
She, she says we won't make it now

Believing the things I did were wrong I'm leaving
It fades away, forget about it

She's binding, can't do a thing alone rewinding
Times before can't live without it

Angry and gone
And the list goes on and on
If it's love I will defer
I'm being lost being with her

I can't move on, I can't take it
(Aah)
She, she says we won't make it now
I can't move on, I can't take it
(Aah)
She, she says we won't make it now

I don't know
But you did, but you did, but you did
Please don't go
Now my feelings for you they're now lost
'Cause we're through anymore
I'll write you, I'll call you
No
(Aah)

Being lost being with her
Being lost being with her
Being lost
Forget about it

I can't move on, I can't take it
(Aah)
She, she says we won't make it now
I can't move on, I can't take it
(Aah)
She, she says we won't make it now

I can't move on, I can't take it
(Aah)
She, she says we won't make it now
I can't move on, I can't take it
She, she says we won't make it now
