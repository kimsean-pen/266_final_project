Rising from the darkside
Arriving from beyond
The lord of death approaches
To end all human lives

The pleasure of the torment
Will bring him back to Earth
The time has come for closure
The final hour calls

But there's a way out of the misery
You can join the massacre
Once you're in you're never out
A soldier of the dead forevermore

There's eternity for sale
In the Brave New Hell
You will join here and dwell
In the Brave New Hell (BRAVE NEW HELL)
None can stop the rising
Of the Brave New Hell
You will come alive
In the Brave New Hell (BRAVE NEW HELL)

Your death for life eternal
Is no high price to play
You'll get more strength
From every single human that you slay

The night of devastation
The final holocaust
Bring on the armageddon
Only death remains

But there's a way out of the misery
You can join the massacre
Once you're in you're never out
A soldier of the dead forevermore

There's eternity for sale
In the Brave New Hell
You will join here and dwell
In the Brave New Hell (BRAVE NEW HELL)
None can stop the rising
Of the Brave New Hell
You will come alive
In the Brave New Hell (BRAVE NEW HELL)

Now... that all his enemies have ceased
It's time for the final feast
Tear the flesh of the remains of mankind
The rebirth of Hell on Earth

Behold... eternal eclipse!
Humanity fades away
The creatures bond to black
Will turn color into grey

There's eternity for sale
In the Brave New Hell
You will join here and dwell
In the Brave New Hell (BRAVE NEW HELL)
None can stop the rising
Of the Brave New Hell
You will come alive
In the Brave New Hell (BRAVE NEW HELL)
