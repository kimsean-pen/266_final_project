Clear your tears
And dry your eyes
We live in fear
And drunken lies
Douse the flames
Of devil dawning
The cold blade falls
On misty morning
And for their sins
We live and die
The angel cowers
In blackened skies
So take my hand and walk again
We'll take a walk through yellow rain

She's calling, just calling...

So now's the time
We hear the calling
While lovers feast
By mirrored pools
A million cries
From shattered faces
We dance in tune
To the pipes of gold

She's calling, just calling...
