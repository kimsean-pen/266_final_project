Placid, everyone knows that you're rested
The problem 'round here is it's always
It's always been
Breathin' take a little time for your dreamin'

You try to fade it out with your pathways
Long lasting

And I've been alone for years, I'm told
Darling you fill the holes
And I know you know but this time's our fault
But darling you cure my soul

Hit it, put it down in my soul
Dark energy
Hit it, put it down in my soul
Dark energy

Hit it, put it down in my soul
Dark energy
Hit it, put it down in my soul
Dark, down, down...

What is this waste in your mind?
Were you restless?
The problem 'round here is you always
You always seem broken

Facin' your fears, you were chosen
Tryin' to figure out if you're frozen
Frozen sin

And I've been alone for years, I'm told
But darling you fill the hole
And I know you know, but this time's our fault
Darling you cure my soul

Hit it, put it down in my soul
Dark energy
Hit it, put it down in my soul
Dark energy

Hit it, put it down in my soul
Dark energy
Hit it, put it down in my soul
Dark, down, down...
