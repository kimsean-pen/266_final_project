This frame... it does nothing to soothe
Thoughts of worst-case seep through its fiber
This frame... ignites every step
Engulf the shadows it creates

Smash, ignite
Destroy the creeping eyes
Hang the rope
Destroy this weakened frame

Two eyes lock onto my pulse
Love comes crashing on my conscience

Change my focus
Lift my spirit...
Boy
Change my focus
you are my spirit
Boy

The crimson moon shines down

Shines down
Shines down

(Shines down)
Hold your tongue, let me speak
(Shines down)
There's more to this than it may seem
(Shines down)
Hold your tongue, let me speak
(Shines down)
There's more to this than it may seem
(Shines down)
Hold your tongue, let me speak
(Shines down)
There's more to this than it may seem
