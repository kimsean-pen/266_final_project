Oh, yeah, I'll tell you somethin'
I think you'll understand
When I say that somethin'
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand

Oh, please, say to me
Let me be your man
And please, say to me
You'll let me hold your hand
Oh, let me hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand

And when I touch you
I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that my love
I can't hide
I can't hide
I can't hide

Yeah, you've got that somethin'
I think you'll understand
When I say that somethin'
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand

And when I touch you
I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that my love
I can't hide
I can't hide
I can't hide

Yeah, you've got that somethin'
I think you'll understand
When I feel that somethin'
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
