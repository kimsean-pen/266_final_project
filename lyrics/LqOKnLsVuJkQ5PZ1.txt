It's summertime
Ladies looking hot
Shaking up what they've got
Elephant Man and Kat, c'mon

Sense is telling me you're looking
I can feel it on my skin
Boy I wonder what would happen
If I trip and let you in

Don't get sby my aggression
I just might be the one
Let's skip this conversation,
Just whine your body up

(Ha ha ha)
Don't wanna wait no more
(Ha ha ha)
You got what I'm searching for

I'm feeling your vibing
I'm riding high is exotic
And I want you,
I want you here

Pull me closer and closer
And hold me tight to your body
I wanna feel you,
I wanna feel you near

Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!

A ese nene lo tengo trikiao
Cuando lo bailo lo bailo de lao
Y lo empujo lo tengo tumbao
Con mis caderas lo tengo amansao wind!

Boy keep doing
What you're doing get me hot
Winding up your body
You don't have to stop

My temperature is rising
Want you more than before
It's an animal attraction,
Whine your body up

(Ha ha ha)
It's the magic on the floor
(Ha ha ha)
I don't wanna wait no more

'Cause I'm feeling your vibing
I'm riding high is exotic
And I want you
I want you here

Pull me closer and closer
And hold me tight to your body
I wanna feel you,
I wanna feel you near

Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!

Whine up your body

Shake up your booty,
Shift it in high gear
She say Ele run your fingers through my hair
All the blin' man coulda see quite clear

The way how she whine it give me nightmare
Find her G-spot and touch her right dere
Waan pop off the clothes she a wear
