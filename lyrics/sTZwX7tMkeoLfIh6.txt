And you say that you have to
And you love that my beard's gone
And you're here for the beach, too
Not because you love us
And you're here for your girlfriend
And also living at the outlet mall
Do you think about dying as much as the rest of the world does?

I bet you do

Sitting on the ocean feeling all your friends relapse
I bet it sucks that you're in the same position

Asking all your friends for "E" at the parties
It doesn't gross me out, it's whatever I'm too drunk to care

And you say you want to drive soon
And how your mom never teaches you
How does it feel with metal in your back?
I bet it gets cold sometimes
And you're laying on my cold floor
While I'm sitting on my warm bed
And all the songs I ever wrote you
Never ever seem to come out right for you

They're right for you
I swear it's true
No one knows you like I do

Sitting on the ocean feeling all your friends relapse
I bet it sucks that you're in the same position

Asking all your friends for "E" at the parties
It doesn't gross me out, it's whatever I'm too drunk to care

Sitting on the ocean feeling all your friends relapse
I bet it sucks that you're in the same position

Asking all your friends for "E" at the parties
It doesn't gross me out, it's whatever I'm too drunk to care
