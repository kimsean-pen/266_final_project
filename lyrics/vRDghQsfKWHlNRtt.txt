Late nights
Talking for hours
Speed killed
My only friend
Lately
Who's in the office?
Do what you're doing
Maybe
I could have loved this
Maybe
I could have felt
Lately
Among the others
I'm doing what i do well
So you do what you're doing now
Do what you're doing now
Do-ooo-ooo-ooo-oo
Do-ooo-ooo-ooo-oo
Fortune
Further and further
Feeling
Kind of lost
You are
Better than others
So do what you do best
Hey kid
There is no limit
Well done
Driving the beat
Tell me
Would you believe it
It's easy to repeat
Easy to repeat
Easy to repeat
Easy to repeat)
(Do-ooo-ooo-ooo-oo)
(Do-ooo-ooo-ooo-oo)
Do what you're doing now
Do what you're doing now
(Do-ooo-ooo-ooo-oo)
(Do-ooo-ooo-ooo-oo)
Do what you're doing now
Do what you're doing now
Do what you're doing now
Do what you're doing now
Do what you're doing now
Do what you're doing now
Do what you're doing now
Do what you're doing now
