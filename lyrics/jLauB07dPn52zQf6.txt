Bet you never knew that a girl like me could fall in love, did you?
Bet you never thought that a girl like me would fall in love

I feel it in my skin
Don't wanna feel like this
Runnin', runnin', runnin' from you
I feel it in my chest
I gotta catch my breath
Tell me that you're feelin' it too

We're gettin' drunk on a weekend
We say goodbye and I pretend
That I don't wanna take you home
Feelin' things that I shouldn't
I'm sayin' things that I shouldn't
I think I let you get too close

I'm low key in love with you
There's no way to hold it
I just can't control it
I'm low key in love with you
There's no way to hide it
My body can't fight it

I'm low key in love
I'm low key in love
I'm low key in love

Somethin' I try to hide
But you got what I like
Floatin' on these feelings for you
And it's such a shame
I'm callin' other friends your name
Fallin' for you too hard too soon

We're gettin' drunk on a weekend
We say goodbye and I pretend
That I don't wanna take you home
Feelin' things that I shouldn't
I'm sayin' things that I shouldn't
I think I let you get too close

I'm low key in love with you
There's no way to hold it
I just can't control it
I'm low key in love with you
There's no way to hide it
My body can't fight it

I'm low key in love
I'm low key in love
I'm low key in love

Bet you never knew that a girl like me could fall in love, did you?
Bet you never thought that a girl like me would fall in love with you
Bet you never knew that a girl like me could fall in love, did you?
Bet you never thought that a girl like me would fall in love with you
