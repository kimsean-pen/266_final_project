Waiting for a lifetime
Like you're carved from the mountain
Sometimes I stand like a statue
Waiting to surprise you

And when it comes, and what it does
Is nail you down, you cannot swerve
You're not the last, you're not the first
To sometimes lose your nerve

You don't need to try hard
You don't need to wise up
It all becomes clear as day
So crystallise love

It's been sleeping since day one
Trapped in your subconscious
Scheming for the moment
When you stop feeling cautious

And when it comes, and what it does
Is nail you down, you cannot swerve
You're not the last, you're not the first
To sometimes lose your nerve

You don't need to try hard
You don't need to wise up
It all becomes clear as day
So crystallise love

You don't need to try hard
(Waiting for a lifetime)
You don't need to wise up
(Like you're carved from the mountain)
It all becomes clear as day
(Sometimes I stand like a statue)
So crystallise love
(Waiting to surprise you)

You don't need to try hard
And you don't need to wise up
It all becomes clear as day
So crystallise love
So crystallise love
