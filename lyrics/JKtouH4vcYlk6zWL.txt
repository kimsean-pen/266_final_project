It's 5 in the morning
Can you at least tell me where you're going
Don't know if i'm really here with you
Well maybe this is on me
Just want to show you how our future could be
Isn't that what you've always wanted darling, darling

So I tried my hardest
To show you something
That I bet no one else could
But in the end
We die apart
So maybe this is good
And from the bottom of my fucking heart
I wish you understood
That I was made for you babe
I was made for you babe

I was made for you babe
I was made for you...

So I tried my hardest
To show you something
That I bet no one else could
But in the end
We die apart
So maybe this is good
And from the bottom of my fucking heart
I wish you understood
That I was made for you babe
I was made for you babe

Now it's 12 o clock you
Not even a text
I hope you come home soon
I can't get out of bed
Would you just tell me what I said
Please just come home
I can't be alone again

When I could tell
Just say
Just one more time
I swear that I will make this fine
Just say
Just one more time
I swear that I will make this fine
Just say
Just one more time
I swear that I will make this fine

So I tried my hardest
To show you something
That I bet no one else could
But in the end
We die apart
So maybe this is good
And from the bottom of my fucking heart
I wish you understood
That I was made for you babe
I was made for you babe
