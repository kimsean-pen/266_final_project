Washing the blood off the pedestals
Drunk with liquor and songs
All icons shattered and none replaced
For we were all fooled and wronged
And serpent's milk on blackened stone
This sand betrayed
You whets your dagger
On the plunderer's lips
Now sharpen the blades
Sharpen the nails

Little rebel mine, rebel mine
I hope you will come with me
I hope you will fight
Little rebel mine, rebel mine
I hope you will come with me
I hope you will fight

Now fear spreads over the roofs
And on down the valleys
And what strange birds cruise here
Now that there's blood on the branches
And serpent's milk on blackened stone
This sand betrayed
You whets your dagger
On the plunderer's lips
Now sharpen the blades
Sharpen the nails

Little rebel mine, rebel mine
I hope you will come with me
I hope you will fight
Little rebel mine, rebel mine
I hope you will come with me
I hope you will fight

[Wir sind geschlagenNicht besiegtIn solcher schlachtErliegt man nichtWir werden nicht besiegtGelernt haben wirDas ist nicht der letzte kampf]

Little rebel mine, rebel mine
I hope you will come with me
I hope you will fight
Little rebel mine, rebel mine
I hope you will come with me
I hope you will fight
