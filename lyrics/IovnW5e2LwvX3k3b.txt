Spend all my time in another place
I'm building a runway for a paper plane
Look at me baby I'm a runaway
Bags in the trunk of my '88

Oh!
Let it be our escape
Let us make our mistakes
Living in these tidal waves

Oh!
Let it be our escape
And when we separate
Don't forget these tidal waves

Spend all my time in another place
I'm building a runway for a paper plane
Quicken our steps as we walk away
Holes in my pockets but gold in my locket

Oh!
Let it be our escape
Let us make our mistakes
Living in these tidal waves

Oh!
Let it be our escape
And when we separate
Don't forget these tidal waves

Oh!
Let it be our escape
And when we separate
Don't forget these tidal waves
