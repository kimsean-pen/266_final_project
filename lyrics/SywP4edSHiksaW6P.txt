Prevail

I saw a vision where I was young and divine
Believed the fiction, it pushed me over the line
Soaked in the waters of a perpetual hate
Come bow before me as I deliver your fate

This world was never enough
Ascending high up above
Acknowledge what I've become

They said to me I will be nothing
They said to me I am too weak
They said to me I will be nothing
They said to me I am too weak

I almost believed I would be nothing
As they shackled their words to my feet
I almost believed I was too weak
I have rose from beneath

I have lived in this vision for all my life
And every moment that I have spent here is compromised
As I gain focus I see myself through a different light
And I've now noticed that I am not who I had in mind

A demon has control of my mind
The darkness sees through these very eyes
I've come to claim what's rightfully mine
Bow or pay with your life
Speak your last words to my knife

Never enough
I've risen up

I have lived in this vision for all my life
And every moment that I have spent here is compromised
As I gain focus I see myself through a different light
And I've now noticed that I am not who I had in mind

I saw a vision where I was young and divine
Believed the fiction, it pushed me over the line
I never meant to lose my self-control
Now I fall headfirst through this abysmal hole
