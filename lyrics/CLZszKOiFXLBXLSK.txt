And I see you there on a wave of life and I wonder how
It could all be so pure
And I go along just for the ride and I hope for a
Journey like a child sure
Of what he wants and of what he needs and to dive in like
There's no tomorrow
Let's see this through to something new we'll pay the price
If we beg of borrow

Hold me down to the ground
It's safe if I am not allowed
To go out

And you wake up broke but you feel just fine too young to
Know what happens inside
And you hear the thoughts that you shut outside looking for
Something you may not find
Cause I want to know how it feels so good when you stay up and
Love the dark through and through
But the sun will rise and we'll wise up too remember that
It's not just me and you

Hold me down to the ground
It's safe if I am not allowed
To go out

On the count of now
On the count of here
Oh I see you there
Won't you look at me?

Hold me down to the ground
It's safe if I am not allowed
To go out
