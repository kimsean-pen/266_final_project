Master of pain
Swinging his chains
An endless tyrant
Agony in vein

Let me out

Make me bleed
Master of pan
I surrender all I have
To the ones above me
And I won't let them see me

I've accepted my last defeat
And I won't let them see me

This is the end of all things fair
The year of heartache
The season of despair

My last words
