You've gotta help me, I'm losing my mind,
Keep getting the feel you want to leave this all behind,
Thought we were going strong,
I thought we were holding on
Are we?

No they don't teach you this in school
Now my hearts breaking and I don't know what to do
Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holding on
Are we?

You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

All of the rumours, all of the fights
But we always find a way to make it out alive
Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holding on
Are we?

You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

Minibars, expensive cars, hotel rooms and new tattoos, good champagne and private planes
But we don't need anything
Cause' the truth is out, I realise that without you here like there's just a lie
This is not the end
This is not the end
We can make it you know it, you know

You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever

You and me got a whole lot of history
We could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history
So don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever
So don't let me go
So don't let me go
We can live forever
Baby don't you know
Baby don't you know
We can live forever
