There are people that will investigate you
they'll insinuate, intimidate and complicate you
don't ever wait or hesitate to state the fate that awaits those who
try to shake or take you
don't let them break you
You can do anything you want to do
it's not wrong what i sing it's true
you can do anything you want to do
do what you want to
People that despise you will analyze then criticize you
they'll scandalize and tell lies until they realize
you are someone they should have apologized to
don't let these people compromise you
be wise too
You can do anything you want to do
it's not wrong what i sing it's true
you can do anything you want to do
do what you want to
Hey you you're not their puppet on a string
you can do everything
it's true if you really want to
you can do anything you want
Just like i do
You can do anything you want to do
it's not wrong when i sing it's true
you can do anything you want to do
do what you want
Hey you
no can do
hey you
yes you
