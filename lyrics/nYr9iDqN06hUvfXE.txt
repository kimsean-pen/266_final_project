So obvious the way I feel for you
But you ain't always running my mind
We find it hard to always tell the truth, yeah
So we just keep on telling white lies

It ain't that ordinary, but you're too good to miss
So I keep telling you, and you keep telling me
It doesn't even matter, we both know what this is
So I keep telling you, and you keep telling

White lies, white lies
I keep on telling you, telling you, telling you
White lies, white lies
I keep on telling you

I don't believe in anything you said
But that don't mean you're easy to forget, no
I don't mind your broken promises
'Cause what we got is something we won't regret
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

It ain't that ordinary, but you're too good to miss
So I keep telling you, and you keep telling me
It doesn't even matter, we both know what this is
So I keep telling you, and you keep telling

White lies, white lies
I keep on telling you, telling you, telling you
White lies, white lies
(White lies, yeah)
I keep on telling you, telling you, telling you
White lies

You keep on telling me, babe, and I keep on telling you
You keep on telling me, babe, and I keep on telling you
You keep on telling me, I keep on telling you, oh
White lies, white lies, white lies

White lies, white lies
I keep on telling you, telling you, telling you
White lies, white lies
I keep on telling you, telling you, telling you
White lies, white lies
You keep on telling me, I keep on telling you, oh (White lies)
White lies, white lies, white lies
