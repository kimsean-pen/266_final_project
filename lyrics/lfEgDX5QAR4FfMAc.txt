Rejected since day one
My name is, Bastard Son
I've been damned so many times I've lost count
Blue collar working man
Devices masterplan
Bi-polar with a mental sidearm

I'm sick and I'm twisted
I'm broken you can't fix it
Don't make me, cause I'll do it
Red button and we'll all go

Into the river below
I'm running from the inferno
They'll think I'm insane
But you'll all know my name
Into the river below
I'm running from the inferno
I'll take all the blame
The front page and the fame

Contraption
Made up of
Nuts and bolts
Creates the
New monster
to burn your family tree down
Tick tocking
Times up now
Split second
The world frowns
Lonely hearts
Never had nobody

I'm sick and I'm twisted
I'm broken you can't fix it
Don't make me, cause I'll do it
Red button and we'll all go

Into the river below
I'm running from the inferno
They'll think I'm insane
But you'll all know my name
Into the river below
I'm running from the inferno
I'll take all the blame
The front page and the fame
I'll take all the blame
The front page and the fame
Into the river below
Into the river below
Into the river below
Into the river below

Into the river below
I'm running from the inferno
They'll think I'm insane
But you'll all know my name
Into the river below
I'm running from the inferno
I'll take all the blame
The front page and the fame
Yeah I'll take all the blame
The front page and the fame
But you'll all know my name
And they'll think I'm insane
But you'll all know my name
But they'll think I'm insane
