We're hanging on by a thread
You keep bowing your head
Did they follow you home in the night

If this isn't love
There's no push without shuv
I think they followed me home in the night

They said the screaming wasn't loud
A heavy heart hammered you down
You said the screaming wasn't loud

I'll call you, call you all night
I'll call you, call you all night
I called you, called you all night

Now the cracks all start to show
See the cracks all start to show

Do they understand you
Do they call out your name
Do they even miss you
All these boys look the same

Did they try to hear you
When they call out your name
Do they even miss you
Do they shoulder the blame

Do they understand you
Do they call out your name
Do they even miss you
All these boys look the same

Why can't you remember me
Why can't you remember me
I've seen it all before
I've seen it all before

Why can't you remember me
Why can't you remember me
I've seen it all before
I've seen it all before

Why can't you remember me
Why can't you remember me
I've seen it all before
I've seen it all before
