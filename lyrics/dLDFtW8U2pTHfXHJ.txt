Earth is gold, sea is green
The dream belongs to the dreamer
Starlit night, moonlight bright
The dream belongs to the dreamer

Earth is gold, sea is green
The dream belongs to the dreamer
Live or die, laugh or cry
The dream belongs to the dreamer
Hit 4,6 not for 10
Straighten out a river 'gain
It's all a fix, it's all pretend
A maize is made to meant to have no end
It's all a fix, it's all pretend
Cover man is not your friend
Earth is gold, sea is green
The dream belongs to the dreamer

And let the music, be the healer
The dream belongs to the dreamer

Fat cat profiteers, perpetrating a big
Fat lie
Hidden in the shadows
Orchestrating light

What's strong for the spider
Is chaos for the fly
Death for the caterpillar
Birth for the butterfly

All the music makers
All the dreamers of dreams
Living in a world, it isn't what
It seems

Earth is gold, sea is green
The dream belongs to the dreamer
Live or die, laugh or cry
The dream belongs to the dreamer
I lend the music, be the healer
Let the music be the healer
The dream belongs to the dreamer
