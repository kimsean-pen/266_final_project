I feel the cold in my bones
All thoughts are leaving me
I feel the weight on my chest
Can't keep my eyes open anymore

I am suddenly feeling so light
Am I set free from the boundaries of earth?
Endlessly far away
Drifting off
Connection lost
Let me feel infinity
Blinding streams of colour passing through me
Oh is this the end?
Or the start of something new?

Will this be the end?
Or the start of something new?

Let me feel infinity
Can I find my place among the stars?
An ocean of light awaits
Left behind this mortal shell
To reach into the depths of the unknown

Diving down
Down the rabbit hole
What is there for me to discover?
I found the right place
A place where nothing burdens me
I am everywhere
Everywhere and nowhere

I feel the cold in my bones
But my thoughts are in focus now

Oh I feel relieved from the weight
My eyes are opened wide
