Why am I tired all the time?
Not that I really mind
It's just another kind of life for me
Dreams creep in on tender feet
They rob me while I sleep of everything that's dear to me

Here where everything's so clear
The world's a perfect sphere
Floats by and disappears
Now with clarity of mind a truth of different kind
Is crawling up my spine
