All-consuming lonesomeness
Repelled by the world
Self-inflicted exclusion
Errant, forgotten, misunderstood
His soul despairingly trying to navigate
Through the cold seas of grief
Tempest, devouring swirl of emotions
His perception changes beyond belief

Black frost
Strong and tight
The burden unseen
Black frost
Growing but hiding in secrecy
Without snow or rime
Without warning but so severe
Black frost
Losing touch with the innermost self
Ominous threat
Will it cause his mind to capsize?

Intuition, a sense of loss
The raging seas of grief
Raindrops and tears unite
Sanity and reason divide

Black frost
Growing but hiding in secrecy
Without snow or rime
Without warning but so severe
Black frost
Losing touch with the innermost self
Ominous threat
Will it cause his mind to go down?

He's frantically routing his sanity
Through murky waters and cold
Unrest, unaware of the grave danger
His perception darkened, disordered, misled

Horrified and voiceless
As he realized black frost took over his mind
He goes down

Black frost
Growing but hiding in secrecy
Without snow or rime
Without warning but so severe
Black frost
Losing touch with the innermost self
Is his mind able to thaw?
