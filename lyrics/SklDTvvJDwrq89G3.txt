Humanity prevails, through the eye of terror
A twisted reality - mutilated eternally

Here now you shall stay to grow in strength return some day
To seek revenge on human prey, mutilated as your mind decays

Chaos god took your soul, your destiny they control
Warp your form with power untold, watch as your life unfolds
A warrior of chaos see, ripped apart internally
Now face unreality, destroy mankind totally

Through the eye of terror, a place no man dare go
For in this place of darkness, worlds of chaos overflow

For in the eye of terror, power of chaos wait
To bring mankind's destruction, they come to seal your fate

Lost now for ageless time, soon your gods shall give you the sign
Unleash the power, vengeful wrath, destroying all within its path

Fall to your knees, and worship me
Your twisted minds - reality
As vengeance takes its deathly hold
Watch as the darkness unfolds
I am your master - you are my son
I'll take your soul - now we'll be as one
Together we can rule the worlds
Watch as the darkness unfolds
The darkness unfolds
