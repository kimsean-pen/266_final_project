Oh I most, I mostly feel I had a good day
Oh I most, I mostly feel I had a good day
It wasn't that great

But if I start to move it, 'cause I'd rather be
Gettin' to wonder, why don't you stay here?
But on the contrary
I live in loneliness
So lonely
So lonely...

Aaaaah
Come and dance with me
Bitter sweet fool
I wanna be your toy
I wanna be your toy
Come and dance with me
Bitter sweet fool
I wanna be your toy

I wanna be your toy
Oh I most, I mostly wish I had a bad way
Oh I most, I mostly wish I had a bad way

That would be great.
I'll be so up for it
You wouldn't slow me down.
I always want to put it in another minute
I could run for
Through it's all the same
If you want

We could try today...
Aaaaah
Come and dance with me
Bitter sweet fool
I wanna be your toy
I wanna be your toy
Come and dance with me
Bitter sweet fool
I wanna be your toy
I wanna be your toy

I wanna be your toy
I wanna be your toy
I wanna be your toy
I must admit, I've never felt it myself
I wanna be your toy
I wanna be your toy

I wanna be your toy
I wanna be your toy
Come and dance with me
Bitter sweet fool
I wanna be your toy
I wanna be your toy
Come and dance with me
Bitter sweet fool
I wanna be your toy
I wanna be your toy
