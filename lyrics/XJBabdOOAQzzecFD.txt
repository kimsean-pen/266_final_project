I like to dance all night
Summons the day
But that's how I play
Yeah that's how I play
I said who are you?
Don't matter who you are
So we dance all night
And dance all day

I say
I say

We're gonna fuel the fire
Gonna stoke it up
We're gonna sip this wine
And pass the cup
Who needs avenues
Who needs reservoirs
We're gonna show this town
How to kiss these stars

I say
I say

I'm on a hunt to kill
Gonna skin the hide
A yelp and scream
And away I ride
I'll never top this view
I'll never follow ground
It's all for you
For what you've found

I say
I say
I say
I say

It's gonna take your head
And gonna drive you home
It's gonna keep on, keep on, keep on
And then forever roam
