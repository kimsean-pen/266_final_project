My question still hanging in the air
Your lips are as still as this moment
I watch you pretend it isn't there
My question
Simple question
Talk to me
Tell me what your saying when you don't say anything
Talk to me
Tell me what your saying when you don't say anything
Is it what I think

And I'm shaking
Waiting for your mouth to move
Moment of silence
Moment of truth
Moment of silence
Moment of truth

Something I never want to know
Wish I could suck the sound back down my throat
Back to the silence
Thats uncomfortable
Away from the violence
Of your still closed mouth
The truth came out
Talk to me
Tell me what your saying when you don't say anything
Is what I think
Talk to me
Tell me what your saying when you don't say anything
Is what I think

And I'm shaking
Waiting for your mouth to move
Moment of silence
Moment of truth

And I'm shaking
Waiting for your mouth to move
Moment of silence
Moment of truth
Moment of silence
Moment of truth

And I'm shaking
Waiting for your mouth to move
Moment of silence
Moment of truth
Moment of silence
Moment of truth

And I'm shaking
Waiting for your mouth to move
Moment of silence
Moment of truth
Moment of silence
Moment of truth

And I'm shaking
Waiting for your mouth to move
Moment of silence
Moment of truth
Moment of silence
Moment of truth
