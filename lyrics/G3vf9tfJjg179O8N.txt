When the Earth split in two
I was I, you were you
I run for you
Run for me too
When the war rose and fell
And the oceans are swell
I run for you
Run for me too

Come on, Sir
Just give me an answer
Come on, Sir
Now I need an answer
I won't be gone with the goners
Come on, Sir
Just give me the answer
I fear the future

When the club come and go
To the top of your skull
I run for you, what can I do?
When the war start anew
In our bed, in our room
I come for you (I come for you)
Come for me too

Come on, Sir
Just give me the answer
Come on, Sir
Now I need an answer
My baby's lost in the monster
Come on, Sir
Just give me the answer
I fear the future
