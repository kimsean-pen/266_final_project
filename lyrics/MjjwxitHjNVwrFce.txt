I don't wanna be alone
So come show me what you know
Baby, you're all that I need
I don't wanna be alone
So we can't just let this go
You know
I'll be all you need

Staying up real late
I miss you next to me
I know you're not alone
Probably with some girl you don't know

I'm the only one who truly knows you best, baby
Don't forget the things we did to put our minds at ease
I'm the only one who truly knows you best, baby
Don't forget the things we did to put our minds at ease
I'm the only one
I'm the only one

I don't wanna be apart
I'll be careful with your heart
'Cause I wear mine on my sleeve
I don't wanna be apart
So let's go back to the start
You know
That's where I'm gonna be

Staying up real late
I miss you next to me
I know you're not alone
Probably with some girl you don't know

I'm the only one who truly knows you best, baby
Don't forget the things we did to put our minds at ease

We were always together
I know I made you feel better
We loved, loved
Yeah, we loved without caution
