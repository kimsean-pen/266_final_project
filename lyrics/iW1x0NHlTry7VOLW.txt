I take one step forward and two steps back
It's always been like that, it shouldn't be like that
I'm trying to overcome myself
I'm trying to work around this hell
Two steps forward and three steps back
Why is life like that, why am I like that?
I'm trying to understand myself
I'm trying to fight through this hell

Why can't I see this clearly?
Why can't I?

Hey hey you, while you're living the dream
If you've seen what I've seen, nothing is clean
Hey hey you, while I'm rolling the dice
I've been paying the price, I've been walking on ice
Hey hey you, just get out of my way
At the end of the day, you got nothing to say
Hey hey you, see the look in my eyes
Will the sun ever rise, will the sun ever rise?

Will the sun ever rise again?

All the days gone by and I can't get 'em back
What was my name now and what is my name now?
I'm trying to rise above myself
I'm trying to look beyond this hell
Seems like I got way off track
No one ever found me, no one unbound me
They wonder why I hate myself
Surrounded by a living hell

Why can't I see this clearly?
Why can't I?

Hey hey you, while you're living the dream
If you've seen what I've seen, nothing is clean
Hey hey you, while I'm rolling the dice
I've been paying the price, I've been walking on ice
Hey hey you, just get out of my way
At the end of the day, you got nothing to say
Hey hey you, see the look in my eyes
Will the sun ever rise, will the sun ever rise?

Will the sun ever rise?
Will the sun ever rise?
Will the sun ever rise?
Will the sun ever rise?
Will the sun ever rise?

Hey hey you, while you're living the dream
If you've seen what I've seen, nothing is clean
Hey hey you, while I'm rolling the dice
I've been paying the price, I've been walking on ice
Hey hey you, just get out of my way
At the end of the day, you got nothing to say
Hey hey you, see the look in my eyes
Will the sun ever rise, will the sun ever rise?

Will the sun ever rise?
Will the sun ever rise?
Will the sun ever rise?
No
