Caution, he dangerous
Well my sweet little honey got away
Stop him, the load is black
For my sweet little honey not to play
It's a mystery, where'd he go
He disappeared, nobody knows
Fa la la you can't take my baby
Away from me.

Mockingbird
Did you knock on my door
You say go back, go back
Now I'm a one man show.

Mockingbird
Did you knock on my door

Now I'm a one man show.

Yeah, I'm not a two-face minnie
I'm not a puppet, I'm not a clown
It's just a misdemeanor
They wanna throw 'em in the big house.

Goin' to a place where I belong
Goin' to a place I call my home.

Mockingbird
Did you knock on my door
You say go back, go back
Now I'm a one man show.

Mockingbird
Did you knock on my door
You say go back, go back
Now I'm a one man show .

Mockingbird
Did you knock on my door
You say go back, go back
Now I'm a one man show.

Mockingbird
Did you knock on my door
You say go back, go back
Now I'm a one man show

Mockingbird
Did you knock on my door
You say go back, go back
Now I'm a one man show.
