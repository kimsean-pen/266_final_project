Speak to me in a language I can hear
Humor me before I have to go
Deep in thought, I forgive everyone,
As the cluttered streets greet me once again

I know, I can't be late
Supper's waiting on the table
Tomorrow's just an excuse away,
So I pull my collar up and face the cold, on my own

The earth laughs beneath my heavy feet,
At the blasphemy in my old jangly walk
Steeple, guide me to my heart and home
The sun is out and up and down again

I know, I'll make it
Love can last forever
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth

And you can make it last forever,
You can make it last forever,
And you can make it last

And for a moment, I lose myself,
Wrapped up in the pleasures of the world
I've journeyed here and there and back again

But in the same old haunts, I still find my friends
Mysteries not ready to reveal
Your sympathies I'm ready to return

I'll make the effort
Love can last forever
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth
Tomorrow's just an excuse

I'll make the effort
Love can last forever
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth
Tomorrow's just an excuse

And you can make it last forever,
You can make it last forever,
You can make it last,
Forever you

And you can make it last forever,
You can make it last forever,
You can make it last,
Forever you.
