Why you acting all brand new?
When you know that we're through, through, through
See you checkin' up on me
But there's nothing you can do, do, do

Sick and tired of your stupid games
Ain't your baby so say my name
I was with it for a minute
Now we're done, d-d-d-done

(Wanna know)
Where I'm at, who I'm with, what I'm doin'
(You should know)
It was fun, now we're done, d-d-d-done

Drunk dialin' 3am
Baby please you're dead wrong
Think I'm crying in my bed
Baby please you're dead wrong
Right now I'm spillin' bottles
Dancing to my own song
I ain't talkin' man, talk to the hand
You know you're dead wrong

Don't even try to holla
Ain't no DJ that can bring this back
I don't care about your dollas
I got my own chips, stack, stack, stack

I'm a free me, can't tie me down
Quit showin' up just hangin' around
It was cool for a minute
Now we're done d-d-d-done

(Wanna know)
Where I'm at, who I'm with, what I'm doin'
(You should know)
It was fun, now we're done, d-d-d-done

Drunk dialin' 3am
Baby please you're dead wrong
Think I'm crying in my bed
Baby please you're dead wrong
Right now I'm spillin' bottles
Dancing to my own song
I ain't talkin' man, talk to the hand
You know you're dead wrong

You ain't my man no more
I'm gonna hit the floor
I hold my hands up high
As I wave goodbye (bye bye)

There's nothing you can say
'Cause I'm gone, baby, gone
There's nothing you can do
Yeah I'm gone, baby, gone

Drunk dialin' 3am
Baby please you're dead wrong
Think I'm crying in my bed
Baby please you're dead wrong
Right now I'm spillin' bottles
Dancing to my own song
I ain't talkin' man, talk to the hand
You know you're dead wrong

Drunk dialin' 3am
Baby please you're dead wrong
Think I'm crying in my bed
Baby please you're dead wrong
Right now I'm spillin' bottles
Dancing to my own song
I ain't talkin' man, talk to the hand
You know you're dead wrong
