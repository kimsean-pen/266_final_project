I am the one, to which you'll go
You are the one, from which I'll run...

Fading to grey, the wanton pray

You'll find shelter, I'll find none
I'll leave you pointless life undone

Breathing your days, my anguish stays

Fate of my face, I've seen your face
I turn and run, you'll have no place

Time is the father, in my corrupt mind
Pain, echoes, in the silent sky...
Remember life now?
