When you're big and troubles seem so far
You put your belly up to the bar
Squint your eyes, you can almost miss the dirt
You tell yourself it couldn't hurt

But when you're small
You can't walk down the hall
When you're small
You're not very big at all

When you're low, you reach a certain point
Where you can't really see the point
You can try, but you can't see eye to eye
Yet when you're low then you really know

But when you're high
It's easier to fight
When you're high
You don't have to know why

When you're small
You don't have very far to fall
When you're small
You feel like you belong
When you're small
You can curl into a ball
When you're small
No you're not very big at all
