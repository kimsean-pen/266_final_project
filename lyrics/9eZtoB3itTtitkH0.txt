The angel Moroni asleep in the carport
With the newspaper under his arm
It seems I was late to deliver his car keys
So it looks like we are staying behind
Was Lucifer bashful
In hiding his face from the Lord
Dear Jesus, forgive me
I am only doing as I was told

For as it is written
I will soon one day face my own fire
And this world will go with me
If I can just get them all on my side

Carry me over rainbows and Rainier
Carry me over rainbows and Rainier

I was late to the parlor
When the wind it blew forward
And demanded we get out of town
So me and Moroni
Took the keys to the steeple
And awaited Armageddon to go down
Place your queens on the table
Who are weeping for your daughters
Who are waiting for their someday to return
Every heart will be broken
Prophetic poems spoken
From the mouths of every baby to be born

Carry me over rainbows and Rainier
Carry me over rainbows and Rainier

Let your cries be of joy
May it always and forever fill the void
And allow my heart some room
May it be so that you'll one day need me soon

With my wheels in a turning
And my back to the window
I collected every wave from the shore
I forgot I was human
As I laid up my emotions
And I knocked them like dishes to the floor

Carry me over rainbows and Rainier
Carry me over rainbows and Rainier
