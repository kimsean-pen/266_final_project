I can't recall the last time I was caught between the walls
Those razors in the pillowcases seem to cut em all, but...
Old foes, dead things, take a toll...
Remember, it's just a game

Been a long time since I rock and rolled
It's only rock and roll but I like it, like it
Don't talk-walk, don't feel-real
Don't stay-say, you'll need it anyway

Oh it's my own damn fault, I guess it's good to be the enemy
That don't mean it ain't so bad, bad, bad
Because it's all down hill from here, it's all down hill from here
Motherfucker, it's all down hill from here
It's all down hill, you can't get home from here

Your beast is just a burden that you never keep in line
This "fabulous" is really less, hmm, gets em every time
You roll your eyes for money
Don't act like you're impressed
You spread your legs for TV time
Baby... who fucks you best?

Been a long time since I rock and rolled
It's only rock and roll but I like it, like it
Don't talk-walk, don't feel-real
Don't stay-say, you'll need it anyway

Oh it's my own damn fault, I guess it's good to be the enemy
That don't mean it ain't so bad, bad, bad
Because it's all down hill from here, it's all down hill from here
Motherfucker, it's all down hill from here
It's all down hill, you can't get home from here

Oh it's my own damn fault, I guess it's good to be the enemy
That don't mean it ain't so bad, bad, bad
Oh maybe when you fall, you'll make peace with your gravity
We all know it drives you mad, mad, mad
Because it's all down hill from here, it's all down hill from here
Motherfucker, it's all down hill from here
It's all down hill from here, motherfucker
You can't get home from here, you can't get home from here
Motherfucker, you can't get home from here
You can't get home from here
