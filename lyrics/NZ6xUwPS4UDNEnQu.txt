Okay, Coconut man, Moonheads and Pea
You ready?

Seems like everybody's got a price
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the sale comes first and the truth comes second
Just stop for a minute and smile
Why is everybody so serious?
Acting so damn mysterious
Got shades on your eyes
And your heels so high that you can't even have a good time

Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that, yeah
We're paying with love tonight

It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the, uh, cha-ching cha-ching
Ain't about the, yeah, b-bling b-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag

We need to take it back in time
When music made us all unite
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes
Am I the only the one getting tired?
Why is everybody so obsessed?
Money can't buy us happiness
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now?
Guarantee we'll be feeling alright

Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel, yeah
We're paying with love tonight

It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the, uh, cha-ching cha-ching
Ain't about the, yeah, b-bling b-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag

La, la la la la la, ey
La, la la la la la, ey
La, la la la la la, ey
Price tag
La, la la la la la, ey
La, la la la la la, ey
La, la la la la la, ey
Price tag

It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the, uh, cha-ching, cha-ching
Ain't about the, yeah, ba-bling, ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag

Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, yeah yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Forget about the price tag
Ahh, ahh
