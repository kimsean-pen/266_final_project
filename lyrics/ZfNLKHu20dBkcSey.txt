Roxette

There's a hidden meaning in everything he says
Every close encounter
Every kiss
Every caress
Even the truth has got that bitter taste of a lie
Well, I can read his lips now
I can't read his mind

I can see him dance away now
Oh oh - oh oh oh
I can see him dance away now
Oh oh - oh oh oh

He was one of the kind that seems so hard to find
There's a change of weather
Now he leaves me far behind
That I don't matter to him came as such a surprise
Well, I can read his lips now
I thought I red his eyes

And I can see him dance away now
Oh oh (dance) - oh oh oh (dance)
I can see him dance away now
Oh oh (dance) - oh oh oh (dance)
(Dancing away from me)

I can see him dance away now
Oh oh (dance) - oh oh oh (dance)
Dancing away from me
(Dance away now)
Oh oh (dance) - oh oh oh (dance) ohhh yeah

Oh I can see him dance away now
Oh oh (dance) - oh oh oh (dance)
I can see him dance away now
Oh oh (dance) - oh oh oh (dance)
(Dancing away from me)

I can see him dance away now
Oh oh (dance) - oh oh oh (dance)
Dancing away from me
(Dance away now)
Oh oh (dance) - oh oh oh (dance)
Dancing away from me
(Dance away now)
Oh oh (dance) - oh oh oh (dance)
Dancing away from me
