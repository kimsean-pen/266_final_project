I don't want you anymore, I don't love you anymore
Go away, go away, go away, go away
You're a bad thing, terrible thing
You destroy my head, you un-calibrate my skull
Go away, go away
You're a bad thing, useless thing
You marginalize me, you sabotage me
Go away, go away, go away, go away
You're a bad thing, you horrible thing
You steal my light, you suffocate my life
Go away, go away
You're a bad thing, miserable thing
Like some childish demon
Who takes pleasure from its sting
You're a bad thing, bad thing, bad thing
After you'll see that I'll crawl back
You must be sick
Thought she was my Annie Hall
Or at least Ali MacGraw
Now I feel so wilted, it's a famine affair
The whole attempt with shawty
Just put trash in my body
He was nostalgic for the ground
Hope down the drain
Still flew to your tragedy
In a glass bottom airplane
Looping like a retard
Are you still playing the race card?
She said "You're not boring
I'm just bored with you"
The psychology behind it is ruthless
Wish it weren't true
Wish we weren't so complicated
Wish you weren't so medicated
I don't want you anymore, I don't love you anymore
Go away, go away, go away, go away
You're a bad thing, terrible thing
You don't let me sleep and when you do
It's just teeth falling out nightmares
Go away
You're a bad thing, useless thing
You marginalize me, you sabotage me
Go away, go away, go away, go away
You're a bad thing, you horrible thing
You've been trying to make me ugly
So you'd have a reason to leave
So you could say you were just like
Abandoning the ruins
You bad thing, miserable thing
Like some childish demon
Who keeps insects on a string
You're a bad thing, bad thing, bad thing
After you'll see that I'll crawl back
You must be sick
