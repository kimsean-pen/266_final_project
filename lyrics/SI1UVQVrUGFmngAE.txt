Weave on
Sisters of the night
On your loom of pain
Try and stitch the darkness through the light

Weave on property and crime
The wars and waste
Gives our souls a break from the hunger
For the profits and the saints

Stitch it on the weapons drawn and children's splayed
And the fathers found in unmarked graves
With your fingers pale and numb
Just braid

Oh, you sisters weave on
Let the blood run through your thread
Oh, you sisters weave on
With your stitching purple blue and red

Oh, you sisters weave on
Let the blood run through your thread
Just you still weave on

Feed on, sorry sons of state
Preaching salvation, while we fall with such amazing grace
Feed on, love of money love of race
Disrespect of country and of neighbor's neighbored in our hate

Stitch it on, the bothers gone
And lives they gave to their foreign graves
With your fingers pale and numb
Just braid, just braid

Oh, you sisters weave on
Let the blood run through your thread
Oh, you sisters weave on
With your stitching purple blue and red

Oh, you sisters weave on
Let the blood run through your thread
Oh, you sisters weave on
With your stitching purple blue and red

Oh, you sisters weave on
Let the blood run through your thread
Oh, you sisters weave on
With your stitching purple blue and red

Just you sisters weave on
Let the blood run through your thread
Oh you sisters just weave on

These are the plans
The words we hear from mind deranged
You there who share his pain
Withdraw from this place and speedily

Lest the harsh, spite your mind also with madness
How dare, you urge us to cowardice

I'm ready to endure with him whatever must be
I am ready to endure with him whatever must be

Oh, you sisters weave on
Let the blood run through your thread
Oh, you sisters weave on
With your stitching purple blue and red

Oh, you sisters weave on
Let the blood run through your thread
Oh, you sisters weave on
With your stitching purple blue and red

Oh, you sisters weave on
Let the blood run through your thread
Oh, you sisters weave on
With your stitching purple blue and red
