Into the wild
Thoughts of an
Unearthly child
Plants and animals
Black and white
Journey on
Through day and night

Theres a darkness in my soul
A darkness in my soul

Into the wild
Thoughts of an
Unearthly child
Plants and animals
Black and white
Journey on
Through day and night

No thoughts remains
Only a shell
And bodystains
The war is coming
I've got to find
The thought inside
My other mind

Theres a darkness in my soul
A darkness in my soul

Into the wild
Thoughts of an
Unearthly child
Plants and animals
Black and white
Journey on
Through day and night
