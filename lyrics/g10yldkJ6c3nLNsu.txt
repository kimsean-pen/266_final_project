You don't have to be beautiful
To turn me on
I just need your body baby
From dusk till dawn
You don't need experience
To turn me out
You just leave it all up to me
I'll show you what it's all about

You don't have to be rich
To be my girl
You don't have to be cool
To rule my world
Ain't no particular sign
I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time
And your kiss

You gotta not talk dirty, baby
If you wanna impress me
You can't be too flirty mama
I know how to undress me
Let me be your fantasy
And maybe you could be mine
You just leave it all up to me
We can have a good time

You don't have to be rich
To be my girl
You don't have to be cool
To rule my world
Ain't no particular sign
I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time
And your kiss

Think I'd better dance now

Women and girls rule my world
I say they rule my world
Act your age mama (not your shoe size)
Not your shoe size
Maybe we could do the twirl
You don't have to watch dynasty
To have an attitude
You gotta leave it all up to me
My love will be your food

You don't have to be rich
To be my girl
You don't have to be cool
To rule my world
Ain't no particular sign
I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time
And your kiss
