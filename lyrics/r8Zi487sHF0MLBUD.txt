We're two parties
Two parties ending

What if you move
What if you hide
There's only so much you can miss
Before we both collide

A little tornado
A little hurricano
Last day of magic
Where are you
A little tornado
A little hurricano

We're two parties
Two parties ending

I'll be the man with the broom
If you'll be the dust of the room
And there's only so much you can hide
Before I corner you

Last day of magic
Where are you
A little tornado
A little hurricano
Last day of magic
Coming through
The eye of the storm
And I hold on to
A little tornado
A little hurricano

I'll be the man with the broom
If you'll be the dust of the room
And there's only so much you can hide
Before I corner you

Last day of magic
Put the whole ride through
The eye of the storm
In a single room
A little tornado
A little hurricano
Cavalry come
Cavalry go
Cavalry leave me alone
A little serenade, oh
A little cup of cane, oh
Last day of magic
Where are you
A little tornado
A little hurricano
