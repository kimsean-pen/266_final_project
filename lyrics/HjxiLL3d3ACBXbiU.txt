What would you do
with the songs you will make?
What would you do
with the stars you'll finally get to?
And all the stars will shine bright
with me
with me
forever till the end

What would you do
with the songs you will write?
What would you do
with the stars you'll finally get to!?
And all the stars will shine bright
with me
with me
forever till the end

Baby Listen to this Hey!
This is the dream of every man
Baby listen listen to this
Listen to this song about me burning out
Your reason is your endless oh heartache
But I'll grow
I will grow like the stars

Hey riches! You will pay out.
Hey preachers! You will forgive.
And you, you bitter boys...
Come on Come on

What will you do
with the songs you will make?
What will you do
with the stars you'll finally get to?
Your reason is your endless oh heartache
But I'll grow
I will grow like the stars
