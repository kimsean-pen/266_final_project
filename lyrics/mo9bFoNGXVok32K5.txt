Oooh oooh oooh oooh heeeyyy
oooh oooh oooh

Goodbye summer hate to see you go
I wasn't ready for autumn wind to blow
So lonely
We had a fine time holding hands in June
Warm in a sunshine watching love in bloom
Where are you now?

My heart is frozen in this place
waiting for another summer's day
to bring you back my way
ooooooh

hello winter, watch the swirling snow
I didnt have a blanket for the cold
So lonely now

My heart is frozen in this place
waiting for another summer's day
to bring you back my way
oooh oooh oooh

(Bridge:)
I'll be waiting under the poplar tree
anticipating when you'll come back to me
in the spring ooooh, in the spring yeah

Hello summer kiss from my old friend
been such a long time, tell me how you've been
so lonely now
yeeaahh

My heart is frozen in this place
waiting for another summer's day
to bring you back my way
ooohhh ooohhh

Goodbye summer hate to see you go
