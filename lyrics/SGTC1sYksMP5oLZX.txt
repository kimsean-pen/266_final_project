I get so lonely
Can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you

I get so lonely
Can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but

Sittin' here with my tears
All alone with my fears
I'm wonderin' if I have to do without you
But there's no reason why

I fell asleep late last night
Cryin' like a newborn child
Holdin' myself close, pretendin' my arms are yours
I want no one but you

I get so lonely
Can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you

I still remember to the day
In fact it was a 3rd Monday
You came along to be the one for me
Now I'm alone

Sittin' here by the phone
Call and say that you're okay
So that I'll have the chance to beg you to stay
I want no one but you

I get so lonely
I can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you

I get so lonely
(Every time I see your face, baby)
Can't let just anybody hold me
(Every time I hear your name)
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you

I get so lonely
(Every time I see your face, baby, ooh)
Can't let just anybody hold me
(Every time I hear your name)
You are the one that lives in me, baby
Want no one but you

Gonna break it down, break it down, break it down
Gonna break it down, break it down, break it down, oh oh
You know that I know that I get so lonely thinkin' of you, ooh, hoo
No, no

I get so lonely
(I get lonely when I hear your name)
Can't let just anybody hold me
(I get lonely when I see your face)
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you

I get so lonely
Can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you

I get so lonely
(I get lonely when I hear your name)
Can't let just anybody hold me
(I get lonely when I see your face)
You are the one that lives in me, babe, oh
I don't want no one but you

I get so lonely
(Every time I hear your name)
Can't let just anybody hold me
(Every time I see your face)
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you
