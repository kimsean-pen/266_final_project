You turn me off by the push of a button
Then you pretend that I don't mean nothing
I'm not a saint that's easy to tell
But guess what honey you ain't no angel

You like to scream these words as a weapon
Well go ahead take your best shot woman
I wanna leave you it's easy to see
But guess what honey it's not that easy

We get so complicated (COMPLICATED)
This thing is for our memories

So rip my pictures from your wall
Tear them down and burn them all
Light the fire and walk away

There's nothing left to say so
Take the ashes from the floor
Bury them to just make sure
That nothing more is left of me
Just bittersweet memories
(Memories)

I wanna run-escape from your prison
But when I leave I feel something is missing
I'm not afraid that's easy to tell
This can't be heaven it feels like I'm in hell
You're like a drug that I can't stop taking
I want more and I can't stop craving
I still want you it's easy to see
But guess what honey you're not that good for me

We get so complicated (COMPLICATED)
This thing is for our memories

So rip my pictures from your wall
Tear them down and burn them all
Light the fire and walk away

There's nothing left to say so
Take the ashes from the floor
Bury them to just make sure
That nothing more is left of me
Just bittersweet memories

Just bittersweet memories

We get so complicated
This thing is for our memories
We get so complicated (complicated, complicated...)

So rip my pictures from your wall
Tear them down and burn them all
Light the fire and walk away

There's nothing left to say so
Take the ashes from the floor
Bury them to just make sure
That nothing more is left of me
Just bittersweet memories
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
There's nothing left to say
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
There's nothing left to say
