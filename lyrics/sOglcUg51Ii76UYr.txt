It's the loneliness
that's the killer

So you want
to be free?
To live your life
the way you wanna be
Will you give
if we cry?
Will we live
or will we die?

Tainted hearts
heal with time
Shoot that love
so we can stop the end

Solitary brother
Is there still a part of you that wants to live?
Solitary sister
is there still a part of you that wants to give?

If we try
and live your lives
the way you wanna be
yeah

Solitary brother
Is there still a part of you that wants to live?
Solitary sister
is there still a part of you that wants to give? (x3)

Racism in among future kings can only lead to no good besides
