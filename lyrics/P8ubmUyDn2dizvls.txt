I've been waiting for the stars to come out
Dinner it was fine
But I can't lie 'cause I've been waitin for ya
To come back to mine
I've been thinkin of you 24/7 and every 65
Now the girl from Impanema
She's here, lying by my side

I got you now and I just wanna
Show you how to play
Goosebumps on your body
Guide the way

CHORUS:
I wanna go all night
Ain't no stoppin' 'till the breakin' of the dawn
I wanna go inside every corner
Girl you really turn me on
I wanna go
Knock knock
Our bodies to the beat
And when the morning comes
We're lettin the sun shine and stay in bed
you can't separate us
We fit together

I can feel you comin' closer
Dancin' in the dark (Dancin' in the dark) (Ohh)
I touch your lips and kiss your shoulders
Send a letter to your heart
I can't explain to which extreme I'm feelin' you (feelin' you)
How many triple X dreams that's been starring you

I got you now and I just wanna
Show you how to play
Goosebumps on your body
Guide the way

CHORUS
I wanna go all night
Ain't no stoppin' 'till the breakin' of the dawn (breakin' of the dawn)
I wanna go inside every corner
Girl you really turn me on (I wanna go I wanna go)
I wanna go knock knock
Our bodies to the beat
And when the morning comes (when the morning comes)
We're lettin the sun shine
And stay in bed (oh baby)
you can't separate us
We fit together

I won't get nothing done of what I ought'a do,
it doesn't really matter to me
I-I-I am here with you
I can't explain to what degree I'm feelin' you
How many triple x dreams I've had starring you

But I got you now and i just wanna show you how to play (show you how to play)
Goosebumps on your body
Guide the way

I wanna go all night,
ain't no stoppin' 'till the breakin' of the dawn (breakin' of the dawn),
I wanna go inside every corner (every corner baby)
girl you really turn me on
I wanna go knock knock
our bodies to the beat (knock knock to the beat hits you)
and when the morning comes
we're letting the sun shine
stay in bed,
you can't separate us
we fit together
I wanna go all night (all night)
ain't no stoppin' 'till the breakin' of the dawn(all night)
(there ain't no stopping till the breakin' of the dawn) (inside)
I wanna go inside every corner
