i'll just let the silence drift over my mind
would you ease up on me?

i have failed at everything that i ever tried
would you ease up on me?

would you ease up on me?

i will rot away until there's nothing to judge
would you ease up on me?
crystalline angel voices flooding my blood
would you ease up on me?

would you ease up on me?

"this country.this universe... all over the world now..."
