You turn me on
And it's hard to turn me on
Mornings I tell you
What I dreamed
Before we're swallowed
By the work machine
And spit out
In the veining drained half dry
And that is why you turn me on
And it's hard to turn me on
We traveled many miles
To no guarantee
Every thing's a joke to you
It's not that way to me
And Walt Disney
Cannot make me happy
Cannot make me go along
But you turn me on
And it's hard to turn me on
