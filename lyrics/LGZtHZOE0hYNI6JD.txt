I am clearly broken and
No-one knows what to do
Pieces of the puzzle don't fit
So I pound them into you

Itching is the pulse inside
Creeping up to come alive
It's just doing what
It's gonna do

Times are looking grim these days
Holding on to everything
It's hard to draw the line

Shut the fuck up! Get up!
Shut the fuck up! Get up!
Shut the fuck up! Get up!

I can't wait to wet my eyes
Now and look at you
Peace through pain is precious
'Specially when it's done by you

Itching is the pulse inside
Creeping up to come alive
It's just doing what
It's gonna do

Times are looking grim these days
Holding on to everything
It's hard to draw the line

And I am hiding in this empty space
Tortured by my memories
Of what I left behind

Shut the fuck up! Get up!
Shut the fuck up! Get up!
Shut the fuck up! Get up!

Up
Up
Up
Up
Up

Times are looking grim these days
Holding on to everything
It's hard to draw the line

And I am hiding in this empty space
Tortured by my memories
Of what I left behind

Shut the fuck up! Get up!
Shut the fuck up! Get up!
Shut the fuck up! Get up!
