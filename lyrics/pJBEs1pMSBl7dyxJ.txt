Better off, trading my regards
Thinking on, l want to play more safely
Frozen days, that pragmatic start
Now they're gone, the night just stays so empty
Who's to say, being strong keeps you unglued
ls it a fact, you haven't a clue
Puzzle solved, smashing down your weight in gold
Take it back, you handle it

lt's not enough, just so you know
Through bleeding intentions, you'll see all of us
A bitter crush, it's time to go
Your secret endeavors were always too much

Extend your grip, turning black like you do
Slow inhale, an endless void you granted
Magnet poles gonna tear us in two
Want to know just how the end goal shifted
Hurting hope, chase another thankless pursuit
l heard she called when you were in rouge
Close the gate, soul feels like it's forever new
When l'm through, don't blink on it
lt's not enough (We could fake it all away)
Just so you know (l'd already noticed)
Through bleeding intentions, you'll see all of us (Motives, change)

A bitter crush (Listen, it's late, just stay)
lt's time to go (Why do we still do this)
Your secret endeavors were always too much (lt's pointless, ok)
Kept all the love inside your palm
l needed attention, you wouldn't give up
lt's time to stop, you've done enough
l've taken up waiting and thinking of us
lt's not enough (We could fake it all away)
Just so you know (l'd already noticed)
Through bleeding intentions, you'll see all of us (Motives, change)

A bitter crush (Listen, it's late, just stay)
lt's time to go (Why do we still do this)
Your secret endeavors were always too much (lt's pointless, ok)
Kept all the love (Seeking in the night or day)
lnside your palm (Trying for a daydream)
l needed attention, you wouldn't give up (With us, babe)
lt's time to stop (Feed me words you want to say)
You've done enough (Are you even trying)
l've taken up waiting and thinking of us (Or wasting the flame)
