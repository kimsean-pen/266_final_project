Lately I've been trying desperately
To understand these flaws that make me, me
I know I've got some problems, so tell me
What's so perfect about you anyway?

I thought I told you

I don't feel a thing I'll catch a body on a Tuesday
It's not a joke, I'll make you wish you never knew me
I don't feel a thing I'll catch a body on a Tuesday
You're greeting reapers if you see me coming through G

Thirty minutes till you see the truth
You can pray but no ones coming

Sometimes I sit and regret, the thing's I've done
The things I've said. And now I
Live with the constant reminder of who I was
And the struggle of who I am

I thought I told you

I don't feel a thing I'll catch a body on a Tuesday
It's not a joke, I'll make you wish you never knew me
I don't feel a thing I'll catch a body on a Tuesday
You're greeting reapers if you see me coming through G

Thirty minutes till you see the truth
You can pray but no ones coming for you
Thirty minutes till you see the truth
You can pray but no ones coming
