Rumor has it that your Daddy's coming down he's gonna, pay the rent

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

one who would make our, dreams come true
I ain't too proud of all the
struggles and the hard times we've been through
When this cold world comes between us
Please tell me you'll be brave
Cause I can't realize the danger when forgiveness fades away

Say to you
