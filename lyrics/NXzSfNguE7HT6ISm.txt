Flickers of a false crescent moon
I was starting to fall deep in love with you
Oh what will become of us?
Oh what will become of us?

Injuries do nothing to our love
But anomalies are what I'm dreaming of
Oh what will become of us?
Oh what will become of us?

Despite my shortcomings, I'm alright
I'm alright

Looking at each moment as the past
I'm left wondering which one
Will be the last
Oh what will become of us?
Oh what will become of us?

Foolish thoughts
For which there are no cure
Complicate the things
That I once knew for sure
Oh what will become of us?
Oh what will become of us?

Despite my shortcomings, I'm alright
I'm alright
