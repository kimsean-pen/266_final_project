With a swerve, my eyes avert
My mouth somehow forgets to work
So I stare until you shout
Wondering why you can't figure me out
With a change, I call the names
I'm spitting out words, hoping it works
Still I stare while they all shout
Why can't I even figure it out?

The time I'm wasting
Can't say where I've been
Catching my same old way
Slowly spin beneath the day
Your time I'm wasting
Can't say where we've been
Cause it seems to me that
Nothing's what it's ever meant to be

With my fate, my thoughts erase
My head's a blur, the picture fades
My eyes, they keep on shutting down
I can't see why you won't figure me out

The time I'm wasting
Can't say where I've been
Catching my same old way
Slowly spin beneath the day
Your time I'm wasting
Can't say where we've been
Cause it seems to me that
Nothing's what it's ever meant to be

Why can't you figure me out?

With a twist
My mind has missed
You said
That I forget

The time I'm wasting
Can't say where I've been
Catching my same old way
Slowly spin beneath the day
Your time I'm wasting
Can't say where we've been
Cause it seems to me that
Nothing's what it's ever meant to be
Your time I'm wasting
Can't say where we've been
Cause it seems to me that
No one
