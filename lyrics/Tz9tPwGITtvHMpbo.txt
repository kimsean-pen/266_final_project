Never said what I was thinking
The night you turned up at my door
I could tell that you'd been drinking
As we went crashing to the floor
You came from Santa Monica
With teardrops in your eyes
We passed out in the shadows
Of a lonely Thursday night

We kissed away our memories
And fucked away the pain
We went out for some coffee
And then we did it all again
My Krystalline
Ooh ooh I want you Krystalline
Ooh ooh I want you Krystalline

Couldn't tell what you were thinking
The night I turned up at the bar
I told you I quit drinking
And you laughed til you saw stars
I came to Santa Monica
With flowers in my hand
I grabbed you by the lips with mine
And slowly pulled you in

We kissed away our memories
And fucked away the pain
You called in sick to work
Then we did it all again
My Krystalline
Ooh ooh I want you Krystalline
Ooh ooh I want you Krystalline
Ooh ooh I want you Krystalline
Ooh ooh I want you Krystalline
