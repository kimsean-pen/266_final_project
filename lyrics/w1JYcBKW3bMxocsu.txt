Another constellation dies
Do what you want 'cause it's your own sky
Just call me when the phone stops ringing
Thanks for coming by
I'm just glad I'm on your good side
Where it's smoldering you're freezing
It's never all that easy to decide

This is the land of a thousand words
But it seems so few are worth the breath to say
Sit doubting looking after my own worth
And you just keep on saving the day
I'll try to stay but it's in vain when you're far
I'm on the run to wherever you are

And that's the nature of the chase
You fall so far behind you end in first place
Pass the torch this time we're running to each's own regret
There's no harm in playing hard to get
Boundlessness deceives me
But baby you may turn the corner yet

This is the land of a thousand words
But it seems so few are worth the breath to say
Sit doubting looking after my own worth
And you just keep on saving the day
I'll try to stay but it's in vain when you're far
I'm on the run to wherever you are

I'm not gonna do everything you say
Tried to stay but time is running out
But now I'm on my way
(to where ever you are)
I'm not gonna do everything you say
Tried to stay but time is running out
But now I'm on my way
(to where ever you are)
I'm not gonna do everything you say
Tried to stay but time is running out
But now I'm on my way
(to where ever you are)
I'm not gonna do everything you say
Tried to stay but time is running out
But now I'm on my way
