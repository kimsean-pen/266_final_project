When we were having a good time
I got a little sentimental
The rental of your love
Was all that you gave up
But I wanted it all
I wanted it all

When we were doing the slow climb
The peak was a forgone conclusion
To lose it broke my heart, I only got one part
But I wanted it all
I wanted it all

When we were given a new chance
I got a little over zealous
Jealous, of your old girl
I wanted to be your whole world
I wanted it all
I wanted it all

I wanted it all
I wanted it all
