I've forgiven you 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.000 times
I know of plenty other women who have
Never forgiven their men for lesser crimes
You say that you're so sorry
And you'll never do it again
Well I wish you well but go to hell little darlin
You thought about 15.625 ways to make amends
Oh baby but while you weren't looking I was
Over here cookin you a cold plate of revenge
You say you're lost without me
And can we still be friends
Well I wish you well but go to hell, little darlin'

Go to hell, little darlin'
And leave this girl alone
You lost the right to love me at night
When you gave that dog a bone
So if you find me on your mind I recommend you think again
I wish you well but go to hell,
little darlin'
I know about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Other men that wanna take your place
You know I'm kind of inclined to make all of
em mine and take time to rub it in your face
Didn't your mother tell you
That cheaters never win?
Well I wish you well but go to hell, little darlin'
Go to hell, little darlin'
And leave this girl alone
You come to me down on bended knee
With a 22 carat stone
So if you find me on your mind I recommend you think again
I wish you well but go to hell, little darlin'
Burn baby burn
Don't call out for me
Lessons won't be learned
If I go easy
You shouldn't have lied
You know about my pride
No one ever makes a fool of me
Don't try to revive
The love that has died I'm leaving you indefinitely
Burn, baby, burn
Burn, baby, burn
Burn, baby, burn
Burn, baby, burn
