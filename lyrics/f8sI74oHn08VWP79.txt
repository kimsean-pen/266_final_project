Well it's not far down to paradise, at least's not for me
If the wind is right you can sail away and find tranquility
Oh the canvas can do miracles, just you wait and see, believe me
It's not far to never, never land, reason to pretend

And if the wind is right you can find the joy of innocence again
Oh the canvas can do miracles, just you wait and see, believe me
Sailing, takes me away
To where I've always heard it

Just a dream and the wind to carry me
Soon I will be free
Fantasy, it gets the best of me when I'm sailing

All caught up in the reverie
Every word is a symphony, won't you believe me?
Sailing, takes me away
To where I've always heard it

Just a dream and the wind to carry me
Soon I will be free
It's not far back to sanity at least it's not for me

And when the wind is right you can sail away and find serenity
Oh the canvas can do miracles, just you wait and see, believe me
Sailing, takes me away
To where I've always heard it
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
Soon I will be free
