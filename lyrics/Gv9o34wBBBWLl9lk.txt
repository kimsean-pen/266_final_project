People always make me crazy
Love me lots, don't love me maybe
What's the point in singing silly love songs?

Who they think they are to tell us?
Make me sad and make me jealous
Don't believe a word, 'cause they are so wrong

Lola, ah, Lola, ah

Sex and lies and mystery
They don't bring out the best in me
Keep jumping from one lover to another

Thank you for the time you've taken
Cleaning up the mess I'm making
Make the same mistake over and over

Lola, I've made up my mind
I'm not gonna fall in love this time
Lola, I've made up my mind
I'm not gonna fall in love this time

Ah, Lola, ah

Why pretend to be so jaded
It's so easy just to hate it
Anyone can love you for a dollar

But when you find your lust for real
You'll beg and borrow, cheat and steal
Trying to get the money just to call her

Lola, I've made up my mind
I'm not gonna fall in love this time
Lola, I've made up my mind
I'm not gonna fall in love this time

Like a fish out of water
It picks you up then spits you out
Why do we even bother
When there's only one way out?

And we both know it, lover

Lola, I've made up my mind
I'm not gonna fall in love this time
Lola, I've made up my mind
I'm not gonna fall in love this time

You can stop it if you try
Love makes you laugh, love makes you cry
The oldest game in history, repeated

You can stop it if you try
Love makes you laugh, love makes you cry
The oldest game in history, repeated

Lola, ah, Lola baby, it's just another love song
Lola, ah, Lola baby, it's just another love song

Lola, I've made up my mind
Lola baby, it's just another love song
Lola, I've made up my mind
Lola baby, it's just another love song
