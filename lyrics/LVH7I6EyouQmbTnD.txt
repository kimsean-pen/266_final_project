Row, there's only seven more miles to go
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
Row, there's only seven more miles to go

We'll reach the isle of her
We'll find the peacock's tail
We'll steal the mother of pearl
We'll eat the dancing girls

Cyclops gazing alone
Facing mirrors that show
A reflection, his own
Face to face

A hand on each of the oars
A hand on each of the oars
We're seven miles from shore
Just keep on going

A hand on each of the oars
A hand on each of the oars
We're seven miles from shore
Just keep on going

[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]

A hand on each of the oars
A hand on each of the oars
We're seven miles from shore
Just keep on going

A hand on each of the oars
A hand on each of the oars
We're seven miles from shore
Just keep on going

Row, there's only seven more miles to go
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
Row, there's only seven more miles to go
Row, there's only seven more miles to go

We'll reach the isle of her
We'll find the peacock's tail
We'll steal the mother of pearl
We'll eat the dancing girls

Cyclops blazing alone
Facing mirrors that show
A reflection, his own
Face to face

Cyclops gazing alone
Face to face, face to face
Face to face, face to face
Face to face, face to face, face to face
