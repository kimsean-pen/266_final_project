Drinking in the water
Looking at the wider tides
Sitting by the benches
Like a damsel wallflower

Tell me now what you want
What you want
Tell me now, tell me now, don? t stop
Don't stop

Come closer
Let me know 'bout all your secrets
Come slowly
Cross the line of all the reason

You're never better off alone
Here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go

Sillhouettes and dust clouds
Rattling in consolation
Nothing's ever too loud
Bring it on the conversation

Tell me now what you want
What you want
Tell me now, tell me now, don't stop
Don't stop

Come closer
Let me know 'bout all your secrets
Come slowly
Cross the line of all the reason

You're never better off alone
Here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go

I'm never better off alone
I'm never better off alone

Come closer
Let me know 'bout all your secrets
Come slowly
Cross the line of all the reason

You're never better off alone

Come closer
Let me know 'bout all your secrets
Come slowly
Cross the line of all the reason

You're never better off alone
Here we go, here we go

You're never better off alone
You're never better off alone
You're never better off alone
