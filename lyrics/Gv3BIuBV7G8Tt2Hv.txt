Build up, Tear down
Set free, Rewind
The circle is ending
I'm done pretending
Left behind
Resist to be reputed
Protect the undisputed
Behold your insufficiency
Wistfully
Behold your demolition
Asume there's no ambition
None better suited
Build up, Tear down
Set free, Rewind
The circle is ending
I'm done pretending
Left behind
I am hollow
Not to follow
I am hollow
Rewind
The circle is ending
I'm done pretending
Left behind
The same logical notion
Concealed secret emotion
Behind rest in devotion
Stately in your ocean
In your ocean
Build up, Tear down
Set free, Rewind
The circle is ending
I'm done pretending
Left behind
Hopeful, Undistilled
Intention Unfulfilled
Destroyed to justify
To wake up and to die
My quiet ruin
Build up, Tear down
Set free, Rewind
Rewind
The circle is ending
I'm done pretending
Left behind
I am hollow
Not to follow
I am hollow
Not to follow
Shatter
Fall
Never found at all
Yet secretly told
To rewind
Over
And over
And over again
That's why
Even ruins
Die
