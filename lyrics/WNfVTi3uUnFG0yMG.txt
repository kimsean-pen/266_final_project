They come and go but they don't know
That you are my beautiful
I try to come closer with you
But they all say we won't make it through

But I'll be there forever
You will see that it's better
Our hopes and our dreams will come true
I will not disappoint you
I will be right there for you 'til the end
The end of time
Please be mine

I'm in and out of love with you
Trying to find if it's really true
Oh no no no no
How can I prove my love
If they all think I'm not good enough

But I'll be there forever
You will see that it's better
Our hopes and our dreams will come true
I will not disappoint you
I will be right there for you 'til the end
The end of time
Please be mine

I can't stop the rain from falling
Can't stop my heart from calling you
It's calling you
I can't stop the rain from falling
Can't stop my heart from calling you
It's calling you (I can't stop the rain)
I can't stop the rain from falling
I can't stop my heart from calling you
It's calling you

But I'll be there forever
You will see that it's better (much better...)
Our hopes and our dreams will come true (will come true...)
I will not disappoint you (oh... no...)
I will be right there for you 'til the end
The end of time
Please be mine
