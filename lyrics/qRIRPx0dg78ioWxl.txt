And I was hopin
That you had an atlas in your head
So fed up of
The same old man
Theres broken bedrooms and there are broken hands
You were so fed up of the same old broken man

An do you wanna
Do you wanna
Do you wanna make love to me
I know you wanna
I know you wanna
I know you wanna make love to me

Oh I came to tell you
That your my favourite girl
An would u like it if I put u into my world
Theres broken hearts in basements
An broken love on the streets
You were so fed up of it all always involving me

But do you wanna
Do you wanna
Do you wanna make love to me
I know you wanna
I know you wanna
I know you wanna make love to me

Do you want
Do you want to
Do you wanna make love to me
I know you want to babe
I know you want to
I know you want to make love to me
Do you wanna
Do you wanna
Do you wanna make love to me
I know you wanna babe
I know you wanna
I know you wanna make love to me
