Seasons blow away, but the love is just the same
Each time you go away, but the love won't let me stay
Each time you go away, but the love won't hurt today
Seasons blow away, but the love still hurts the same
Seasons blow away, but the love is just the same
Each time you go away, but the love won't let me stay
Each time you go away, but the love won't hurt today
Seasons blow away, but the love still hurts the same
Seasons blow away, but the love is just the same
Each time you go away, but the love won't let me stay
