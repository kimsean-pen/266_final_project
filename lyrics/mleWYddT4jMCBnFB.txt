I think I'm gonna be sad, I think it's today, yeah
The boy that's driving me mad is going away
He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride and he don't care

He said that living with me was bringing him down, yeah
He would never be free when I was around
He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride and he don't care

Don't know why he's riding so high
He ought to do right, he ought to do right by me
For he gets to saying goodbye
He ought to do right, he ought to do right by me

I think I'm gonna be sad, I think it's today
The boy that's driving me mad is going away, oh
He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride
He's got a ticket to ride and he don't care, don't care

Think I'm gonna be sad
Think I'm gonna be sad
Think I'm gonna be sad
Think I'm gonna be sad
Think I'm gonna be sad
Think I'm gonna be sad
