Smell my fear
Carry me far away from here
Get me running in the street like rain
Not even saints will complain

And you're so pretty to look at
But I don't understand
Oh my god look at
And won't you grab my hand

If only you would hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me now

Only the lonely get out of here and live this life
Only the lonely

Smell my disease
And my impatience are easy to please

I've got everything I need, nothing, not a thing, nothing

Don't be afraid
Of the mess we might have made
It was all supposed to be this way
And ill get up to clean it out one day
Hold me hold me now

Only the lonely get out of here and live this life
Only the lonely

I've got everything I need, nothing, not a thing, nothing
