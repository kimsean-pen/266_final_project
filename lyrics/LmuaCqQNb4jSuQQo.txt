Run the race that will lead to nowhere fast
Trapped in the haze of this mindless false reality
Wandering a path laid out by fools
That they call "progression" where chaos rules

There is more to life than this
We are more than just this flesh
We are alive and our time has come
For a new awakening

Come death, come suffering, I will not live in fear
In this fleeting life where time escapes us
The path of least resistance is a slow, quiet death
I'd rather burn out than fade away

There is more to life than this
We are more than just this flesh
We are alive and our time has come
For a new awakening

I would rather die than live my life in fear
Out of step, no regrets in the new awakening

I will not live in fear
Live life with no regrets
I will not live in fear
I will not live in fear

There is more to life than this
We are more than just this flesh
We are alive and our time has come
For a new awakening

I'd rather burn out than fade away
