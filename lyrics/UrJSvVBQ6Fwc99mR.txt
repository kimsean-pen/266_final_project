I'm not a monster, I'm just a sick man.
Who would give anything to have his soul back.

You should probably just shoot me in the head now,
Otherwise, I'm gonna kill you.
I'm sick, really sick.
I'm one of them now.

Quarantine me.
I'm infected.
Quarantine me.
Don't you just love what I've become.

I'm not a monster, I'm just a sick man.
Who would do anything, to get his soul back.

You should probably just cover your eyes now.
I'll have to warn you, this is gonna hurt, really hurt.
I'm one of them now.

Quarantine me.
I'm infected.
Quarantine me.
Don't you just love what I've become.

I don't blame you for wanting me dead.
I'm one of them now.

I feel it in my blood now its turning me, It's turning me.

You better lock the doors and hide.
