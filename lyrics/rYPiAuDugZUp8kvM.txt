Well there's nothing here to see
Just dead bodies on the pavement
And I drink myself to death
If I could only keep the feeling anymore
Into forms how I died and cast the freedom of falling
The freedom of falling

But your hand next to mine
While I stared straight into heaven
Not a crack in my smile
Features closing in together
It's been said that I'm yours
But I've failed to find the freedom of falling
Freedom of falling
The freedom of falling down

Don't dry your eyes, It'll start to show
There's no use in trying if you can't get close
So take me tonight somewhere I can find the freedom of falling
The freedom of falling
The freedom of falling down

There's nothing left to be
'Cause nobody's watching
So take another drink
'Cause there's no use in counting anymore
Into form
How I kill to catch the freedom of falling
The freedom of falling

Don't dry your eyes, It'll start to show
There's no use in trying if you can't get close
So take me tonight somewhere I can find the freedom of falling
The freedom of falling
The freedom of falling down

And when I was dead
I took a hit of heaven
Waiting for the sky to drop
Waiting for the sky to drop
When it was over
I counted to 11
Waiting for the time to stop
Waiting for the time to stop

Don't dry your eyes, it'll start to show
There's no use in trying if you can't get close
So take me tonight somewhere I can find the freedom of falling
The freedom of falling

Don't dry your eyes, it'll start to show
There's no use in trying if you can't get close
So take me tonight somewhere I can find the freedom of falling
The freedom of falling
The freedom of falling
The freedom of falling
The freedom of falling
The freedom of falling
The freedom of falling down
