If simple I'll be that I'll tell to tell
And if the wise could reveal themselves
We could begin to dress the ins and outs
The horizon of our lake

As the force of it can be controlled
As if outside is an object we can hold
Our voices float above the depths of it
What we cannot permeate

Come to my door
Won't you liven me up with color?
Put your pen and paper away
I have no need for you to guess my age
I can tie my own laces
Find the solace I seek in other places
But I cannot need you more

Too fargone for semaphore

This side of red to cause from new alarm
The sound I make can only go so far
Today the only thing that I can do
Is wait for you

And in this lingering uncertainty
The voice across the waves agrees with me
We pay very oppressed to be free
And I wonder if it is enough

Come to my door
Won't you liven me up with color?
Put your pen and paper away
I have no need for you to guess my age
I can tie my own laces
Find the solace I seek in other places
But I cannot need you more

Too fargone for semaphore

And if the force of it can be revealed
We had be hold until it even still
What we cannot keep and what we cannot kill
What we cannot communicate

It is the quiet voice that says it best
There is no certainty to preciousness
We have a friend who holds us in his grasp
And someday he'll be gone
