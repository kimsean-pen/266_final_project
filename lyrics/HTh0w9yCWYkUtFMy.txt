I saw you last night, I wasnt sober
you saw me last night, you were never sober
into the night we go once more, we screamin

I carry on
tell me about the others
and Ill carry the weight

but do not leave me alone
I never leave you alone
please never leave me alone
(dont you leave me alone)

the streets are red mostly
when you say goodnight still awake keeping me up still
your keeping me up still
I love it when you keep me

your legs over my thighs
think twice
I think I need you
I think I need you
to make my body work

I always leave knowing this will never take
knowing this will never take
I dance through city nights with my head turned around
its happenin again, its always happenin again

I see you hit the ground
And run from me
from me

but I need you, I need you
to make my body work

the streets are red mostly
when you say goodnight still awake keeping me up still
your keeping me up still
I love it when you keep me

I love it when you put your legs over my thighs
think twice, I think I need you
I need you to make my body work

I never wanna leave you alone
please dont leave me alone
ill never leave you alone
