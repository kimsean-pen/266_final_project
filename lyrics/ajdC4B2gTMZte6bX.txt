I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more
I can't prevent the times my anger fills my heart
I can't be sympathizing with a new lost cause
I feel I've lost my patience with the world and all

And all the politicians and their hollow promises
And all their lies, deceit and shame that goes with it
The working man pays everything for their mistakes
And with his life too if there was to be a war

So we only get one chance can we take it
And we only get one life can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading... Like an old dream

A life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday
The victim's minds are scarred for life most everyday
Assailants know just how much further they can go
They know the laws are soft, conviction chances low

So we only get one chance can we take it
And we only get one life can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading... Like an old dream

You can't protect yourself even in your own home
For fear of vigilante cries the victims wipe their eyes
So now the criminals they laugh right in your face
Judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace

Despondent public worries where it all will end
We can't protect ourselves our kids from crime the trend
We cannot warn each other of evil in our midst
They have more rights than us, you cannot call that just
So we only get one chance can we take it
And we only get one life can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading... Like an old dream
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream...
