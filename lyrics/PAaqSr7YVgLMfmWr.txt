I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't live, I can't cry
I can't die, I can't walk, I can't talk
I can booze, I can booze, steal your shoes so I can move
Tumble in the rough, tumble in the rough, tumble in the rough

I'm looking for a new mediation
Still looking for a new way to fly
Don't want any plastic validation
Not looking for a new way to die

I made excuses for a million lies
But all I got was humble kidney pie
So what
So what

I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't live, I can't cry
I can't die, I can't walk, I can't talk
I can booze, I can booze, steal your shoes so I can move
Tumble in the rough, tumble in the rough, tumble in the rough

I'm lookin' for a new stimulation
Quite bored of those inflatable ties
I'm lookin' for a new rock sensation
Dead fish don't swim around in jealous tides

I made excuses for a million lies
But all I got was humble kidney pie
So what
So what
So what
So what

Can't hold you when I miss you
(Tumble in the rough)
Left on a summer intermission
(Tumble in the rough)
Can't hold you when I miss you
(Tumble in the rough)
Left on a summer intermission
(Tumble in the rough)

I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't live, I can't cry
I can't die, I can't walk, I can't talk
I can booze, I can booze, steal your shoes so I can move
Tumble in the rough, tumble in the rough, tumble in the rough

I made excuses for a million lies
But all I got was humble kidney pie
I made excuses for a million lies
But all I got was humble kidney pie
So what
So what
So what
So what
