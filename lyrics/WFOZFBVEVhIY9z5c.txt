Invisible to your brown eyes
You don't know nothing, oh oh
You don't know nothing, oh oh
I've played it cool 'til the right time
You don't know nothing, oh oh
Don't know what's coming

I'm dangerous for you
Don't want you to fall 'cause then you're through
Baby, baby, if we rendez-vous
Gotta know you're heading right into
Baby you're headed into that...

Ooh, I know what you like
Wanna play tonight
All over that black ice
All over that black ice
Ooh, baby, roll the dice
Ooh, it's getting dangerous
All over that black ice
Bet you like that black Ice

Slipping, slipping, sliding
I got you slipping, slipping, sliding
Slipping, slipping, sliding
I got you slipping, slipping, sliding

Keep your heart on ice 'til you get it right
Boy, you don't know nothing
You don't know nothing
Baby, warm me up and I'll play nice
Oh, no, you don't know nothing
Gotta show something

I'm dangerous for you
Don't want you to fall 'cause then you're through
Baby, baby, if we rendez-vous
Gotta know you're heading right into
Baby you're headed into that...

Ooh, I know what you like
Wanna play tonight
All over that black ice
All over that black ice
Ooh, baby, roll the dice
Ooh, it's getting dangerous
All over that black ice
Bet you like that black Ice

Slipping, slipping, sliding
I got you slipping, slipping, sliding
Slipping, slipping, sliding
I got you slipping, slipping, sliding
