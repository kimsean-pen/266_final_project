Solapas colgantes y teguas de Apache
Un hoodie batwing, need money for weed
I won't lie to you, I won't lie to you
I won't lie to you, I won't lie to you

The rest of your nachos, bichicori sin trapo
No sea marro, mi hermano, homie, no sea taca√±o
Huaraches de callo, pelo trasquilado
Saca un peso, vato, la chora del gallo

I won't lie to you, I won't lie to you
I won't lie to you, I won't lie to you
I won't lie to you, I won't lie to you
I won't lie to you, I won't lie to you
I won't lie to you, I won't lie to you
I won't lie to you, I won't lie to you
I won't lie to you, I won't lie to you
I won't lie to you, I won't lie to you
I won't lie to you, loco, this is true
I won't lie to you, I won't lie to you
