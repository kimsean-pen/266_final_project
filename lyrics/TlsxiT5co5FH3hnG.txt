Rain every day
Fog all night
Wind in the evergreen cypresses
See me lord of wind and rain
See me guardian of the underpassses

Wear black when it's light outside
Wear black when there's no light
Wear black following the left hand path
Wear black but I get right

Waves at night
Hard waves at dawn
All this coast is vanishing
Check me out, I can't blend in
Check me out, I'm young and ravishing

Wear black on your forgotten red heart
Wear black in the present tense
Wear black when you come around
Wear black in your absence
Wear black high as a kite (wear black)
Wear black dead sober (wear black)
Wear black when the struggle starts (wear black)
Wear black when it's over (wear black)

Sun through the trees
Head for the sun
Can't find the path back to the main raod
See me lord of the Thomas Guide
See me keeper of the source code

Wear black to the intervention
Wear black back to the car
Wear black wherever I go
Wear black wherever you are
