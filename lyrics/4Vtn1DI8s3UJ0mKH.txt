Over being told to be undressed to look our best
Everywhere my eyes, voice oppressed

Oh look how very far we have come
Cast up our weapons and prop up a gun

Now it's not your way, not your way
Not going to obey, to obey
This is my party, party
And you don't have a say, have a say
This is my own life, own life
Not growing up to be, a trophy wife
So don't parade us round, round we go
In your twisted one house that you know
Know
No it's not your way, not your way
Not now never, not ever

Lower and lower our standards go
As your money grows
Fill ourselves up with plastic and cut ourselves
And tie our bow

Oh look how very far we have come
Strip aside our disguise it like we have one

Now it's not your way, not your way
Not going to obey, to obey
This is my party, party
And you don't have a say, have a say
This is my own life, own life
Not growing up to be, a trophy wife
So don't parade us round, round we go
In your twisted one house that you know
Know
No it's not your way, not your way
Not now never, not ever

Are we making ourselves clear
This is my best position
Apologies for breaking up tradition
It takes two to tangle
When were saying

Now it's not your way, not your way
Not going to obey, to obey
This is my party, party
And you don't have a say, have a say
This is my own life, own life
Not growing up to be, a trophy wife
So don't parade us round, round we go
In your twisted one house that you know
Know
No it's not your way, not your way
Not now never, not ever
