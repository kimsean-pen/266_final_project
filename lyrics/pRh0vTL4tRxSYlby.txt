Hey little kid come here, believe in us and be like us
Taste the sapor of the forbidden seed
Drown the awe breath, far in your azure deeps
Fear aint your foe but your ally to meet your dream
Show me your bound to show you the heart
To outdo your awe and brave become
Drown the awe in your azure deeps
Fear isn't your foe but your ally to win
Whisper the reason that doubt yourself
To trace the path of braveness and strength
Bury the awe in your nightmare's shelf
Nothing to fear but fear itself
Show me your bound to show you the heart
To outdo your awe and brave become
Drown the awe in your azure deeps
Fear ain't your foe but your ally to win

(CHORUS)
Phobos has just be born and sent to mortal's world
To kill human's immortality hope
Phobos has just be born the hidden awe of god
The awe for freedom and his throne loss
