My sweet sixteen beat
The way you taunt me
When fed correctly
Is weighted gently

I added one thing (just one thing)
The love triangle (a love triangle)
It makes my dreams sing (my dreams sing)
My beats were off

See the stars deep in the night (see the stars deep in the night)
Think about you all the time (I think about you all the time)
Darling if you take my hand (darling, if you take my hand)
You'll feel the magic that was mine (you'll feel the magic that was mine)

My sweet sixteen beat
The way you taunt me
Must be wet softly
Must be well-loved

See the stars deep in the night (see the stars deep in the night)
Think about you all the time (I think about you all the time)
Darling if you take my hand (darling, if you take my hand)
You'll feel the magic that was mine (you'll feel the magic that was mine)

Got high going
Got a voice with soul and
I never know that
Until we hit the road and
Got loving on the mind
