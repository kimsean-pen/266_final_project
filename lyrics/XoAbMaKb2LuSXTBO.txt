Yes, all we care about is dem party
Keeping the good vibes, good vibes in the air now

Sing along now

I put that rock in your body, now bounce all night
Keep them guns outta the club, they killin' this vibe
Throw it up for the party, I make'em feel good
Goes out to every club, city and hood now

Put that rock in your body now, yeah
Oooh, lord

Just keep on rockin' and don't take it easy
Gots to get out of the club if you don't feel me
We give it up, ain't no stopping
Everyone up in the club is down with this rocking

And that's all it is now
You better get on the dance floor now
Get on that rhythm now
Imma say booyah!

Booyah!

Imma say what
