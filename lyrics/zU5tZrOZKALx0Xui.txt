Seems like falling down
Far away lost at sea
For the one that's left behind
For the wake of you and me

Maybe I know that
Maybe it's better
But I can't forget the time

I know where I am
Every day every night
Like the one who knows too much
Trusts the same old thing

Maybe I know that
Maybe it's better
But I can't forget the time

Realizing nothing
I remember when

Maybe I know that
Maybe it's better
But I can't forget the time

Maybe I know that
Maybe it's better
Maybe it's nothing
But I can't forget the time
