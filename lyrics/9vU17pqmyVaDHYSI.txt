Sitting alone in my basement again
Staring at the screen, thinking "what comes next?"
I've been at this for days but the nights are worse
The key's in my head, but my mind is cursed

Where's the moment of divine intervention?
Where's the moment of divine inspiration?

I'm saying
I'm yelling
I'm screaming this at myself

One more song
Give me one more song
To free my head I need sound alone
One more song
Give me one more song
To be content in this life unknown

Patience is no longer a virtue I have
I try to find emotion from my broken past
Tossing and turning is what got me here
Maybe sleep deprivation has kept my conscience clear

Where's the moment with an ounce of salvation?
Where's the moment where I feel re-creation?

I'm saying
I'm yelling
I'm screaming this at myself

One more song
Give me one more song
To free my head I need sound alone
One more song
Give me one more song
To be content in this life unknown

Please understand me
I'm breathing, not living
I wanna know if my soul's worth saving
Please understand me
I'm breathing, not living
I wanna know if my soul's worth saving
I wanna know if my soul's worth saving

One more song
Give me one more song
To free my head I need sound alone
One more song
Give me one more song
To be content in this life unknown
