I haven't seen your face in a year
I can't wait till I get there
Just to kiss and squeeze and hug
Girl you know the rest 'cause they tell me

It never rains in southern California
It never rains in southern California

Maybe I'll take the flight out tonight
And you can pick me up about 8
I don't know what airline girl
But I know it won't be late 'cause they tell me

It never rains in southern California
It never rains in southern California

Now I can't sleep at night
Without your 8 x 10 by my side
That day will come
For us to be together
I'm not worried 'bout a thing
Not even stormy weather...

Oh it may be cold on the east coast
But on the other side of town it never rains...

We have so much to talk about
A lot a catchin' up to do
I'll bring the diamond girl
Because I'm so into you
Cause they tell me...

It never rains in southern California
It never rains in southern California

Now since I'll be here at your place
Lets take a weeks trip for two
We don't have to go to far

Just as long as I'm with you
'cause they tell me...

It never rains in southern California
It never rains in southern California

Can we just be alone
Without those other strangers
Calling your phone
Now I don't want to be
That selfish kind of guy
But tonight let me take you
On a natural high

Just me and you alone

Now it may be cold on the east coast
But on the other side of town it never rains...

Now it may be cold on the east coast
But on the other side of town it never rains...

It never rains in southern California
It never rains in southern California
It never rains in southern California
It never rains in southern California

Now it may be cold on the east coast
But on the other side of town it never rains...

Now it may be cold on the east coast
But on the other side of town it never rains...

It never rains in southern California
It never rains in southern California
It never rains in southern California
