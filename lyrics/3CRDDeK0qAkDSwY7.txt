Laying Awake to find
My - Lost piece of mind
And let it go
I Let it go
You're Running wild
While i'm loosing Time
And let it run
Run Run Run

I've Handled the world
And now i - Now i'm old
That is all i wanna do
I've Handled the world
You know i - Want you to get old
That is all i want for you

When will you find
Your peace of mind?
Need to let it bleed
The warning signs
You left behind
My dusk your dawn
You're on your own

I've Handled the world
And now i - Now i'm old
That is all i wanna do
I've Handled the world
You know i - Want you to get old
That is all i want for you

I've Handled the world
And now i - Now i'm old
That is all i wanna do
I've Handled the world
You know i - Want you to get old
That is all i want for you

Lying awake to find my lost piece of mind.
