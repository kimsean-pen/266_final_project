grey balloons
set towards the sun
fighting words
underneath your tongue
soon we will be laughing
out there on the landing
now its too bright
dancing through the ash
you made other plans

suicide
to pick up on the few
in the dark theres a narrow flame
soon we will be laughing
out there on the landing
now its too bright
dancing through the ash
you made other plans
