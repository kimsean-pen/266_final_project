I'm spinning around
I'm out of control
I'm digging myself a familiar hole
All I've got on my mind is your face
But you're gone tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
I walked into your empty room
A different scent a different mood
I got on my knees
Put my head to the ground and begged please

Don't take the covers off your bed
I don't want you to forget
I just want you to remember all the times we spent
Dancing off our feet
Pulling on the sheets

Oh we need each other to go on
I'm tired of waking up alone
Let's run away
If you take me back my love I swear I'll change

I've been trying to get my life in gear
But my body's too weak, my words unclear
I'm falling apart from myself
But myself is the only thing that will take me back
Back to you
Back to love
Back to life
Back to us
Building memories that only we can touch

Don't take our photos off the wall
If it's meant to be they'll fall
But I promise that I'll save them in a book for when
You come back my way
Well just turn to the last page

Oh we need each other to go on
I'm tired of waking up alone
Let's run away
If you take me back my love I swear I'll change
So Let's run away
If you take me back my love I swear I'll change, I'll change

Doors closing
Wilting roses
Her tears run dry
Time save me
Voice helps her
To hear me cry

Don't take the covers off your bed
Our photos off the wall
Don't change anything at all
Don't change anything at all

I need you to go on
And I'm tired of waking up alone
Let's run away
Let's run away
'Cause we need each other to go on
I'm tired of waking up alone
Let's run away
Let's run away
Let's run away
If you take me back my love I swear I'll change
