Digital
Don't you know that I am
Made of Pixels
Digital
Welcome to my 2 dimensional world
D-Dig-Digi
I don't mind coming out to play
Digital
No one thinks I'm real
But who's to say
Yeah
I think you're curious about me
Where I'm from
What I like to eat
The things I love
And what I see
And if I'm trapped behind the screen
I'm very sure that's in your???
A lovely, bubblely, cyber chick
And maybe there is a digital girl
Already living in your machine
