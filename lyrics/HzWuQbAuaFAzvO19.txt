Stranded stranded stranded I'm so stranded
Oh oh baby oh

It's over and done now...
And now I'm sitting here,
thinking that I made the mistake of my life babe
And after having the worse fight,
we ever had... I said I wanna move on baby
For so many days you were only
tryin' to love me, I was so immature baby
So many girls, I was getting attention
But I'm grown now,
and all this spending time that I didn't
wanna do is 'cause I didn't wanna settle down...
But my soul reach,
a heart that I was killing that's not all I could think about...
Now, I was wrong baby... when I have the chance baby,
And I ran away the closest thing to me... Girl, I'm stranded

Girl, I'm stranded
All that we had is gone and I'm sad baby
What am I gone do now...
Girl, I'm stranded
All that we had is gone and I'm sad baby
What am I gone do now... Listen

None of those,
calls that I would recieve when you
use to pleed for me asking who was she
Have stopped coming in, but girl I don't even want
Somebody touching me when the chemistry ain't even you and me
'Cause sex with no emotion ain't nothin' to talk about
I'm at the point that I'm looking for riddance baby...
'Cause mama use to tell me when a good thing comes around
Boy, you better seize the moment baby... cause nothing
Is promised tomorrow... Girl, I'm stranded

Girl, I'm stranded
All that we had is gone and I'm sad baby
What am I gone do now...
Girl, I'm stranded
All that we had is gone and I'm sad baby
What am I gone do now...
