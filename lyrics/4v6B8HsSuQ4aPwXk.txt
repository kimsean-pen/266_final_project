Time alone can't save you
If that's what you're waiting for
It's the end of all your battles
As you're walking out the door
And you wear that face so bravely
And gather up your clothes
And you say you have to go
And you say you have to go

Time alone can waste you
If it's where you place your hope
With all my uphill struggles
How long could you cope?
You wear that face so bravely
And stand out in the rain
But honey, I take all the blame
Honey, I take all the blame

Time, they say, can heal you
Though, that's harder to believe
When you meet the brokenhearted
And see what it meant to leave
And with all my misconceptions
Of what it takes to change
I guess I'll end up just the same
I guess I'll end up just the same
