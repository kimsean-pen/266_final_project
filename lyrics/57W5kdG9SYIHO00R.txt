Atmosphere decays in me
I fail to convict my useless days
The lack of substance
Circle of downfall
Exit less ways
Into pale wake
Tired attempts to crush the design
It's like nowhere
I cannot sell the plight that is mine
Everything is real
But I'm not here
I've lost my strength somewhere nowhere
Used to care about weather
Used to plan the days that came
Used to try and watch you
Used to know my name
Someone said remember
But I can't remember anything at all
Anything at all
