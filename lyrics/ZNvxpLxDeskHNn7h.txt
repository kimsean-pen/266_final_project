In a world of places lets go somewhere we haven't gone
We've got younger faces than our hearts are letting on
And we won't place any stock in old days
Lets save up for something new
Someday I won't have to wait for you

What if I asked, What if I asked you to stay?
What if it cost you your heart and your last name?
And we won't place any stock in old days
Lets save up for something new
Someday I won't have to wait for you
And when we sleep at night
I hope that we write novels in our head
of what to tell the other when we wake
And when morning comes before we're done with volumes left to choose lets say "I love you"
Just "I love you."
"I love you."
And "I love you too."
