Running into trouble
Running into trouble
you got heavenly eyes
a thousand highs
Always on a mission
it's not lovin'
it's not kissin'
it's the heavenly ride
You still got wheels, kid
If I go missing
don't you worry for me
I'm just writting
my side of the story
Just like Jackie
I'm biting my lips
scoring my mind
with whatever I can find
I'm going down the coast
to M.E.X.I.C.O. ...see you
I'm going down the coast
to M.E.X.I.C.O. ...see you
I'm going down the coast
to M.E.X.I.C.O. ...see you
