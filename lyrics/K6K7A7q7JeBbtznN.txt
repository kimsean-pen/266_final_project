Red and green was the color of her dress, manipulation
pale blue was the color of her eyes, manipulation
yellow yellow was her hair
orange sunburst red hot glare, manipulation, manipulation

and you can feel her madness
she will call you out
watch out for her dark side
cause you'll soon figure out
so run on
she's training you
and she's got you dancing

red and green was the color of the ground, manipulation
pale blue was the color of the steel, manipulation
yellow yellow was her hair
icy gray was her glare, manipulation, manipulation

and you can feel her madness
see right through her smile
don't you turn your back and
you'll soon figure out
so run on
she's training you
and she's got you dancing

red and green was the color of the money in her hand
pale blue were the color of the flowers on his casket
yellow yellow was her hair
icy gray was her glare, manipulation, manipulation

and you can see her sadness
she will call you out
watch out for her dark side
cause you'll soon figure out
so run on
she's training you
and she's got you dancing
