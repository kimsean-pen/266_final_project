Tryna hide from the cameras, I ain't going outside today
Couldn't find Hi-Tec, so I'm drinking on Act today
I'ma pull up in style, we gon do a drive by in the wraith
I'ma take it to trial, pray to Lord I beat the case

That money be callin' I don't do no
talkin' so get the fuck outta my face
Gotta tech and a chopper,
with a hundred thousand dollars up in the wraith
You know I ain't slippin' you know that I'm
with it I'll shoot him right up in his face
Three say that I'm trippin' you know that I'm drippin'
I'm wrapped in saran today
I just bought a brand new watch from God, I ain't put it on yet
I don't care bout no bitch,
I ain't giving her shit, spend it all on my homies
I put on my son, from my car to my house, everything, i own it
When it come to that money you know I ain't stun, I be on it
I just got a pet monkey, cashed out on a tiger
But really don't want it, my son don't like him
He say that we beefin you know I'll fight em'
My clip full of thunder you know I'll strike 'em
Wanna join NBA, go and catch you a body
Free Kevin Gates, it's a murder for hire
Double G gang on the front of my title
I ran up my Glock and I bought me a rifle

Tryna hide from the cameras, I ain't going outside today
Couldn't find Hi-Tec, so I'm drinking on Act today
I'ma pull up in style, we gon do a drive by in the wraith
I'ma take it to trial, pray to Lord I beat the case
