The only reason I continue to live is to spite you
Press my ear against the door
To hear the truth in your scathing words

The hardest part
The hardest part
Is admitting to myself...
The hardest part
The hardest part
Is admitting to myself that you were right

I'm just a loser

A letter to my future self;
How the fuck you doing kid?
You went and ruined everything
Gone and fucked up all your dreams
Pour a drink on to the street
For all the friends you wish you had
Now that no one gives a fuck
It seems you went and ended up
Where you deserve, I guess

I guess

I've lived too long
I've lived too long
The only way I can make sense of this mess
I've lived too long
I've lived too long
The only way I can make sense of this mess

Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now that I hate myself?

I hate myself
I hate myself
I hate myself

Are you happy now?
I hate myself

I hate myself
Are you happy now?
