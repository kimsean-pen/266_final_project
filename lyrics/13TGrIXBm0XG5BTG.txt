Chaos
You've been my friend for quite a while
Anger
You've been around for quite some time
I can't escape from it
Love babe, it eats me up alive
We're loveable, but still we're terrified
I can't escape from it
My heart is infected
I gotta protect it
Don't you dare try to break it
I'm gone
My body is fragile
So please let me rest now
Don't you dare try to stop me
I'm gone
Living
For a dream so far away
Trying
To cover up for what we are
We can't escape from it
We have to fight for it
My heart is infected
I gotta protect it
Don't you dare try to break it
I'm gone
My body is fragile
So please let me rest now
Don't you dare try to stop me
I'm gone
It's a shame that we start lying
It's a shame that we're denying
My heart is infected
I gotta protect it
Don't you dare try to break it
I'm gone
My body is fragile
So please let me rest now
Don't you dare try to stop me
I'm gone
My heart is infected
I gotta protect it
Don't you dare try to break it
I'm gone
My body is fragile
So please let me rest now
Don't you dare try to stop me
I'm gone
