Me and Mrs. Jones...
We got a thing... going on...
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong to let it go now...
We meet every day at the same cafe
Six thirty I know I know she'll be there
Holding hands
Making all kinds of plans
While the jukebox plays our favorite song
Me... and Mrs., Mrs. Jones Mrs. Jones Mrs. Jones Mrs. Jones
We got a thing going on...
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong to let it go now...
We gotta be extra careful
That we don't build our hopes up too high
'Cause she's got her own obligations
And so and so do I
Me... and Mrs., Mrs. Jones Mrs. Jones Mrs. Jones Mrs. Jones
We got a thing going on...
We both know that it's wrong...
But it's much too strong to let it go now...
Well, it's time for us to be leaving...
It hurts so much it hurts so much inside
Now she'll go her way and I'll go mine
Tomorrow we'll meet the same place the same time
Me... and Mrs., Mrs. Jones Mrs. Jones Mrs. Jones Mrs. Jones
We got a thing going on
(thing goin' on) We gotta be extra careful
We can't afford to build our hopes up too high
I wanna meet (thing goin' on) and talk with you
At the same place the same cafe the same time
And we gonna hold hands like we used to
We gonna talk it over talk it over
(thing goin' on) We know they know and you know and I know that it was wrong
But I'll make it strong
We gotta let them know now
That we got a thing goin' on a thing goin' on
