You are a sun Goddess
Now hooray
Will you save me?
Hooray for you.
Hooray.

Now the rain it comes,
The rain it blurs the grey line
The grey line
The Greyhound home
You are so vicious
Hurt me, I can take it

Cause it's all in the heat of the moment,
It's all in the pain
Whooo

Sonar, sonar again...

It's on again, (got no wings... gossamer wings...) ...on again...

You are a sun Goddess!
Will you
Will you save me?
Babe babe babe

Cause it's all in the heat of the moment
It's all in the pain!
Whooo
Give the end in to the heat of the moment
Give the in to the pain!
