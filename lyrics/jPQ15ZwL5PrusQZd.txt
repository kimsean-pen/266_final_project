Stars shinin' bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you"
Birds singin' in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me
Say "nighty-night" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me

While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me
Stars fadin' but I linger on, dear
Still cravin' your kiss
I'm longin' to linger 'til dawn, dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams 'til sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams, whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fadin' but I linger on, dear
Still cravin' your kiss

I'm longin' to linger 'til dawn, dear
Just saying this
Sweet dreams 'til sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries far behind you
But in your dreams, whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me
