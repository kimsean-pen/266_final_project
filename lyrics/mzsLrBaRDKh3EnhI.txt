It's hard to believe that it came to this
You paralysed my body with a poisoned kiss
For 40 days and nights I was chained to your bed
You thought that was the end of the story
Something inside me called freedom, came alive
Livin' in a world without you

You told me, my darling
Without me, you're nothing
You taught me to look in your eyes
And fed me your sweet lies
Suddenly, someone was there in the window
Looking outside at the sky that had never been blue

Oh, there's a world without you
I see the light
Livin' in a world without you
Oh, there is hope to guide me
I will survive
Livin' in a world without you

It's hard to believe that it came to this
You paralysed my body with a poisoned kiss
For 40 days and nights I was chained to your bed
You thought that was the end of the story
Something inside me called freedom, came alive
Livin' in a world without you

You put me together
Then trashed me for pleasure
You used me again and again
Abused me, confused me
Suddenly, naked I run through your garden
Right through the gates of the past and I'm finally free

Oh, there's a world without you
I see the light
Livin' in a world without you
Oh, there is hope to guide me
I will survive
Livin' in a world without you

It's hard to believe that it came to this
You paralysed my body with a poisoned kiss (livin' in a world world without you)
For 40 days and nights I was chained to your bed
You thought that was the end of the story
Something inside me called freedom, came alive
Livin' in a world without you

It's hard to believe that it came to this
You paralysed my body with a poisoned kiss
For 40 days and nights I was chained to your bed
You thought that was the end of the story
Something inside me called freedom, came alive
(Livin' in a world without you)

Oh, there's a world without you
I see the light
Livin' in a world without you
Oh, there is hope to guide me
I will survive

Livin' in a world without you
Livin' in a world without you
Livin' in a world without you
Livin' in a world without you
Livin' in a world without you
