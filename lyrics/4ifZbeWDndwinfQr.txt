Come on Cherry Cherry you're still very young
And we've only just started having fun
I'm picking fruit and I choose you, you're so cool
No need to save yourself for someone else to come

So we went completely wild
Kicked over a city street light
Saint Thomas was vandalized
And I'm sorry but I'm not surprised

Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
Congratulations, I'm having visions of us
Breaking everything on our way out of town
We're going places you never dreamed of

Oh Cherry Cherry I'll read your fortune
It says here you're too serious and such
But I learned one thing Cherry you should understand
That nothing really matters very much

So we went completely wild
We were married in the Vegas style
And our families were scandalized
And I'm sorry but I'm not surprised

Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
Congratulations, I'm having visions of us
Breaking everything on our way out of town
We're going places you never dreamed of

Yeah we started the fire, it's out of control
Painted the town til it was up in smoke
So tie a ribbon round it, let the fighters drown it
And we'll go down in the books
Yeah we started the fire and it's burning up
Everywhere around us, take a photograph
If they ever found us, they'd have us surrounded
So pick up
You know you gotta pick it up
Cherry pick it up
Pick it up

Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
Congratulations, I'm having visions of us
Breaking everything on our way out of town
We're going places you never dreamed of
