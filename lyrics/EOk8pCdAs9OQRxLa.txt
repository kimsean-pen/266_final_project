Oh Lord won't you save me
Save me from my soul
Oh lord won't you forgive me
For I have lost control

Oh lord won't you tell me
Am I the righteous or the damned?
Oh Lord won't you please hear me
Do I obey or do I command

Oh lord can't you save me from my twisted little mind
Oh Lord won't you please show me how to turn the water to wine

Oh Lord won't you show me
Am I the sinner - or the saint
Oh Lord won't you please tell me was all my suffering in vain

Oh God have mercy on me
Oh God have mercy on me
Hold me down under holy water
I fear I been laying with the devil
I been laying with the devil

Oh Lord please forgive me for what I'm about to do
Oh Lord won't you believe me I'll burn in hell for you

Oh lord won't you teach me teach me how to see
Oh Lord tell me you love me am I Lillith or am I Eve

Oh God have mercy on me
Oh God have mercy on me
Hold me down under holy water
I fear I been laying with the devil
I been laying with the devil

Oh God have mercy on me
Oh God have mercy on me
Hold me down under holy water
I fear I been laying with the devil
I been laying with the devil

Hold me down under holy water
I fear I been laying with the devil
