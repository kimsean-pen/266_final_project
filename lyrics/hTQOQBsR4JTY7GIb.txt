Well I've tried to live like the way that you wanted me to
Never needed the proof, just followed the rules
I pick up the paces and I move my feet as fast as I can
I'm always falling behind, just float in the lines
You want more and ambition's taken its toll on you
Well hey your confidence is fading with your youth

And you say that dreamers always get what they desire
Well I've found the more I want, the less I've got
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
Or are you hoping that you'll be where you want with a little more?

You're coughing blood again
I know 'cause I clean up the mess every now and then
Fold the line along the seam
Force a smile and never say what you mean
You're in the promised land in someone else's dream
If you want more, and you'll get there
Throw a quarter in the well
It's ok, you're fine, ambition's not a crime

And you say that dreamers always get what they desire
Well I've found the more I want the less I've got
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
Or are you hoping that you'll be where you want with a little more?
Well ask yourself

Is this the life you've been waiting for?
Well ask yourself
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
Well ask yourself
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
Are you hoping that you'll be where you want with a little more?
Well ask yourself
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
Are you hoping that you'll be where you want with a little more?
Well ask yourself
