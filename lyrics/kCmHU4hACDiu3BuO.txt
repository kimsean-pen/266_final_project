The sun goes down, another dreamless night
You're right by my side
You wake me up, you say it's time to ride
In the dead of night
Strange canyon road, strange look in your eyes
You shut them as we fly, as we fly

Stark, hollow town, Carson city lights
Baby let's get high
Spend a johnny's cash, hitch another ride
We laugh until we cry
You say "go fast", I say "hold on tight"
In the dead of night, dead of night

See, see the boys as they walk on by
See, see the boys as they walk on by
As they walk on by, as they walk on by
As they walk on
It's enough to make a young man

Six summers down, another dreamless night
You're not by my side
Scratch on the moon, like a familiar smile
Stained on my mind
Some other town, someone else's life
Dead in the night, in the night

See, see the boys as they walk on by
See, see the boys as they walk on by
See, see the boys as they walk on by
As they walk on by, as they walk on by
As they walk on
It's enough to make a young man
