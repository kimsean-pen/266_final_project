Everybody has their stories
Some of us r being sorry
Most of all 'bout things we've never done (oh oh oh)
Thinkin' that the time's been stolen
That we'll never have this moment
Anyway we keep going to run. (oh oh oh)

We wait, I wonder, can we I wonder
We wait I wonder, can we I wonder
We wait I wonder wonder if we can wait (oh oh oh)
We wait, I wonder, can we I wonder
We wait I wonder, can we I wonder
We wait I wonder, this time I'm gonna stay (oh oh oh)

Hands up to the sky and screaming
People with the broken feelings
Lost in mazes, lost to find themselves (oh oh oh)
My confession's I've been waisted
Time that I was trynna chase and
I'm no more keep running from myself?

We wait, I wonder, can we I wonder
We wait I wonder, can we I wonder
We wait I wonder wonder if we can wait (oh oh oh)
We wait, I wonder, can we I wonder
We wait I wonder, can we I wonder
We wait I wonder, this time I'm gonna stay (oh oh oh)
