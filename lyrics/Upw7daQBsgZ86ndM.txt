In The Winter? time
You feel bitter thats your sign
You're a problem comes to mind
drink through winter the gutters fine

You've got a long way home
You've got a long way home

Wrote a letter about this time

But you better not waste your time
you're a problem that comes to mind
drink through winters the gutters fine

You've got a long way home
You've got a long way home
You've got a long way home
You've got a long way home
