Well I've packed my bags
I'm moving on
Yes I've been waiting far too long
'Cause living with you is like a hole in the head
I know that I'll soon be better off
'Cause living with you is like a hole in the head
I know, well I know that

I don't care about anyone
You know that I'm better off (better off)
Well I don't care about anyone
You know that I'm better off

Oh I've explained
Get off my back
Far too long that I've lost track
'Cause living with you is like a hole in the head
I know that I'll soon be better off
'Cause living with you is like a hole in the head
I know, well I know

That I don't care about anyone
You know that I'm better off (better off)
I don't care about anyone
You know that I'm better off

Is this is as good as it gets
And you know that

I don't care about anyone
You know that i'm better off, better off
I don't care about anyone
You know that I'm better off

I don't care about anyone
You know that I'm better off
I don't care about anyone
You know that I'm better off

I don't care about anyone
You know that I'm better off
I know that I'm better off
