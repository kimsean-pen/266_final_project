I took out my pen and pad and set to write my manifesto
It was a one line poem said don't let nothing ever get you low
Theres a hole open to heaven and I looked straight through
We were love drunk, giving like we was living on the bayou

Who made these fucking rules and said that I was born to live by
Give em hell til I die, don't bury me in no suit and tie
Cause I don't wanna work for another man's money
Yes sir, no sir, give it to me honey

I had a revelation I was told a lie
Live to consume, work to buy and then die
But truth enters the mind one little word at a time
And you can't shake the smell of the cat on the line

Who made these fucking rules and said that I was born to live by
Give em hell til I die, don't bury me in no suit and tie
Cause I don't wanna work for another man's money
Yes sir, no sir, give it to me honey

Who made these fucking rules and said that I was born to live by

Tell me I'm alive, show me I am human
I wanna log off, shut down and leave the room
