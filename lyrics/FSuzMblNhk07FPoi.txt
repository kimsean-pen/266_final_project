Our love couldn't have been any better
Each day I seemed to love you more
Nothing was going to break us apart (break us apart)
The truth couldn't have been any further
From what I thought was reality
Now I've been left with a broken heart (broken heart)

I don't know if it's right or wrong
Somehow I'm weak and strong
Find myself on the run
But where do I belong

It's hard to believe that one day you're here
The next you were gone
It's not that clear for me to see
Why you had to leave
I just can't believe that one day you're here
The next you were gone
It's not that clear for me to see
Why you had to leave

Rewind back to the time when you held me
The air is calm, the stars are bright
Nothing in this world can take you from me (can take you from me)
No stop, think of the pain that I'm feeling
I really want to feel your touch
But now I feel helpless, so helpless baby

Since you went away I feel
That some days still conceal it from me
I'll be free and better off alone

It's hard to believe that one day you're here
The next you were gone
It's not that clear for me to see
Why you had to leave
I just can't believe that one day you're here
The next you were gone
It's not that clear for me to see
Why you had to leave

I could feel you all around me
Knew your loving words surround me
Still I can't believe
Why you had to leave
I was wrong but now I'm broken
Many words been left unspoken
I just can't conceive
Why you had to leave

It's hard to believe that one day you're here
The next you were gone
It's not that clear for me to see
Why you had to leave
I just can't believe that one day you're here
The next you were gone
It's not that clear for me to see
Why you had to leave
