You've got a way with me
Somehow you got me to believe
In everything that I could be
I've gotta say

You really got a way (mmh)
You've got a way it seems
You gave me faith
To find my dreams

You'll never know
Just what that means
Can't you see

You've got a way with me
It's in the way you want me
It's in the way you hold me
The way you show me

Just what love's made of
It's in the way we make love

You've got a way with words

You get me smiling
Even when it hurts
There's no way to measure
What your love is worth
I can't believe the way
You get through to me
It's in the way you want me
It's in the way you hold me
The way you show me
Just what love's made of
It's in the way we make love
Oh, how I adore you
Like no one before you
I love you just the way you are
It's in the way you want me
Oh It's in the way you hold me
The way you show me
Just what love's made of
It's in the way we make love
It's just the way you are...
