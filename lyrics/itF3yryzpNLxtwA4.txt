(Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
(Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)

I've got that lefty curse
Where everything I do is flipped
And awkwardly reversed
You're seldom known and barely missed
I always put myself
In destructive situations
I need oxygen, to be exposed
Where no one goes, where no one's been
When it all comes crashing...

(Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
Now we've got a big, big
Mess on our hands tonight
Sing it (yeah)
(Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
Now we've got a big, big
Mess on our hands tonight

Somebody get my phone
So I can throw it in a public pool
And watch it float
And as it's slowly sinking down
Become a social ghost
Inside a box, cut at the top
To let some light shine in
To remind me what I've done
And where I've been
When it all comes crashing...

(Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
Now we've got a big, big
Mess on our hands tonight
Sing it (ow)
(Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
Now we've got a big, big, big, big
Mess on our hands, on our hands

Don't give in, don't give up, I'll be gone
You don't look innocent enough
We're way too young to be critics
We won't miss anything at all
Don't give in, don't give up
I don't look innocent with this big, big mess on
I'll say something else

(Whoa oh oh)
(Whoa oh oh)
(Whoa oh oh oh)

We've got a big, big mess
Oh, we've got a big, big mess
Oh, we've got a big, big mess
A big, big mess
Now we've got a big, big mess
A big, big mess
Now kick it

(Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
Now we've got a big, big
Mess on our hands tonight
Sing it (ow)
(Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
Now we've got a big, big, big, big
Mess on our hands, on our hands

Don't give in, don't give up (we've got a big, big mess)
I'll be gone (a big, big mess)
I don't look innocent enough
We're too young to be cynics (we've got a big, big mess on our hands)
We won't wish any harm at all
Don't give in, don't give up (we've got a big, big mess)
No one looks innocent with this big big mess on our hands tonight
(A big, big mess, we've got a big, big mess on our hands)

When it all comes crashing...
