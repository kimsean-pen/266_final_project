Are you ready to Rock?
Well rock on!

Pardon me,
I'm only bleeding
but you cut me
to the bone
my imperfections
have reduced you
to a lowly
animal

A part of me
was introduced to you
then it walked right
out the door
And tonight
you're probably feeling
like a human
cannonball

It used to be
that loving you
was easy,
unrestrained
and now
I'm only bleeding
forgone loving,
only pain

Pardon me,
I'm only bleeding
but you cut me
to the bone
and tonight
you're probably feeling
like a human
cannonball
