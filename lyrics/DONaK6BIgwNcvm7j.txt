How, how do you save a mouth
Humming to say the unneeded to say
Easy, don't say
Still, it amazes me

Now, now will guide fate
So give it a change now
Then give it a say

If you knew what you say settles you free
The lama said be wiser than your head
Life is a breeze
If you knew what you say settles you free
The lama said be wiser than your head
Love is just, now
Love is just, now

Give it a change to give a say
Give it a change now
Then give it a say

If you knew what you say settles you free
The lama said be wiser than your head
Life is a breeze
If you knew what you say settles you free
The lama said be wiser than your head
Life is a breeze
