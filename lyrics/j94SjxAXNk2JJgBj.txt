Do you ever walk alone? (Do you ever walk alone?)
Like a drifter in the dark (Like a drifter in the dark)
Seeking out what isn't there (Seeking out what isn't there)
Looking only for a spark

From a girl who's all alone (From a girl who's all alone)
Maybe she's a-driftin' too (Maybe she's a-driftin' too)
Like a shadow in the night (Like a shadow in the night)
Waitin' just to meet with you

And then perhaps in love you'll stay (Perhaps in love you'll stay)
Or fall and go your separate ways (Fall and go your separate ways)
Still searchin' for a spark (Still searchin' for a spark)
Like a drifter in the dark

Doodn doo doo doodn doo (da da da da da)
Doodn doo doo doodn doo (da da da da da)
Doodn doo doo doodn doo (da da da da da)
Doodn doo doo doodn doo

Doodn doo doo doodn doo (da da da da da)
Doodn doo doo doodn dow (da da da da da)
Doodn doo doo doodn doo (da da da da da)
Doodn doo doo doodn doo

Do you ever walk alone? (Do you ever walk alone?)
Like a drifter in the dark (Like a drifter in the dark)
Seeking out what isn't there (Seeking out what isn't there)
Looking only for a spark

(Like a drifter in the dark)
(Like a drifter in the dark)
(Like a drifter in the dark)
