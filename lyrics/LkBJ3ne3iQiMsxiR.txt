There's nothing gracious about our kind
They've got it wrong
No stars aligned

When out of patience
Is your constant state of mind
Crashing down
Like rain on steel
Listen to me
They've no idea

Anticipation is not a friend
Cause at this end
We can't pretend
You be the friend
Help me now

But don't ask for patience
Cause we just don't have the time
Freedom now
Freedom now
