Outside my window is a tree
Outside my window is a tree
There only for me
And it stands in the grey of the city
No time for pity, for the tree or me

There is a world of pain
In the falling rain
Around me

Is there a reason for today?
Is there a reason for today?
Do you remember?
I can hear all the cries of the city
No time for pity for a growing tree

There is a world of pain
In the falling rain
Around me

Outside my window is a tree
Outside my window is a tree
There only for me
And it stands in the grey of the city
No time for pity for the tree or me

There is a world of pain
In the falling rain
Around me
