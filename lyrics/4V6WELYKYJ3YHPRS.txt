Georgie

He was waiting for the one
Never having fun
Serious and overplayed
A fool, kept falling from the start
Pulled himself apart
Never learned to play the game

Oh boy, you just wanted love
That girl, she just ain't enough
To beat a heart inside her fist
Holy masochist
Boy, you listen when I say

Georgie, Georgie
Why you so lonely, lonely?
She ain't the only one
Who's gonna break your heart
So put the past in the past
'Cause you're gonna have a good time
Georgie, Georgie, hm hm
You got your boys in the back
And a pocket full of sunshine
Georgie, Georgie
So put the past in the past
'Cause you're gonna have a good time

He was waiting for the one
Never having fun
Delirious and so blas√©
A fool, kept falling from the start
Pulled himself apart
Never learned to play the game

Oh boy, you just wanted love
Some girls, they just ain't enough
To keep your heart inside her fist
Kamikaze bliss
Boy, you listen when I say

Georgie, Georgie
Why you so lonely, lonely?
She ain't the only one
Who's gonna break your heart
So put the past in the past
'Cause you're gonna have a good time
Georgie, Georgie, hm hm
You got your boys in the back
And a pocket full of sunshine
Georgie, Georgie
So put the past in the past
'Cause you're gonna have a good time

Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
(Hey Georgie)
Hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
(Hey Georgie)
Hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
(Hey Georgie)
Hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
(Hey Georgie)

Georgie, Georgie
Why you so lonely, lonely?
Why you so lonely, lonely?
Why you so lonely, lonely?
