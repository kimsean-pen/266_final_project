How we be, is how we be
You should try, try it on
What will be, is what we'll be
Just let it roll, like a rolling stone

All i see, is you in my dreams
Somewhere close, to my home
All i need, is you by me
Lay me down, lay me down

She's home, she's home sweet home
She's home, she's home sweet home
She's home, she's home sweet home
She's home, she's home sweet home

How we be, is how we be
You should try, try it on
What will be, is what we'll be
Just let it roll, like a rolling stone

She's home, she's home sweet home
She's home, she's home sweet home
She's home, she's home sweet home
She's home, she's home sweet home

Home sweet home sweet home
