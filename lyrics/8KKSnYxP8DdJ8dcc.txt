I've only been here once before.
Please don't be different.
If I could visit you some more.
I would be different.
Cause all these streets they make me high.
They make me different.
I know you people make me shy.
Cause you are different.
Please don't be different.
Please don't be different.
They call it New, New York City.

I wish that I could take you there.
Wish you could listen.
I told you everything I've known.
If you could listen.
Cause all these streets they make me high.
They'll make you listen.
I hope we'll make it out alright.
Wish you could listen.
Oh baby listen.
Oh baby listen.
They call it New, New York City.
They call it New, New York City.
I really hate to say goodbye I'm sorry that I let you down.
I know I said I'll make it right but maybe I could leave this town.
