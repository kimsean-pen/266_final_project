I'm so dope from head to toe

Round and round yeah here we go

Push up on me, I'm on the floor
Talk up on it, make me yours
Give you my love, give me love back
Baby I'm here, where you at

Got that New York swagger, Miami bass
Got my California Loub's on, all up in your face
Yeah I'm mid-west pimp tight, Texas (fire)
