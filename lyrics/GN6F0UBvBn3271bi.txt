i know you're not real when everyone thinks you are
you're some kind of entity floating among stars
i thought that you were as good as dead
you've made your way back into my head
you possessed me
you drink away the pain
how much more can you take?
the drugs, they numb your brain
death patiently awaits
i thought you were as good as dead
you've made your way back into my head
you possessed me
