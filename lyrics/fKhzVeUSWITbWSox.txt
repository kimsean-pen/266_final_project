Rain like rain, rain like rain
Rain like rain, I don't care for the sunshine
I don't care for the sunshine, I don't care for the sunshine

If heaven helps you, help yourself I hope you never change
Rebel, let them help themselves and wash the truth away
Every man will follow them, so what else can you say?
Won't you let my baby, won't you let my baby
Let my baby's love come down like rain

...Like rain, rain like rain
Rain like rain, I don't care for the sunshine
I don't care for the sunshine, I don't care for the sunshine

For every man that will pass scorn on every passer-by
There will be a star that's born to fill the empty sky
You dress me down when you call me up, so don't call me alive
If you won't let my baby, if you won't let my baby
Let my baby's love come down like rain

Rain like rain, rain like rain
Rain like rain, I don't care for the sunshine
I don't care for the sunshine, I don't care for the sunshine
I don't care for the sunshine
