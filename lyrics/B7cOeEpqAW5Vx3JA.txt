If you say "go"
There's a chance that we're running scared
When they say you'll never be there
In the dress that you'll never wear

It's a sorry affair
We're on a hiding to nowhere
It's only right to swear
And they pray that I won't answer you back

It's the dance that we'll never share
And the alarms that you can't do without
Running scared
We're on a hiding to nowhere

No, no, no
It takes a chance, a "truth or dare"
Is there a chance your lover'll be spared
If we say that we're running scared

It's a sorry affair
We're on a hiding to nowhere
It's only right to swear
And they say that I won't answer you back

It's the dance that we'll never share
And the alarms that you can't do without
Running scared
We're on a hiding to nowhere

So you button, you button your lip
And you button, you button your lip
You button, button your lip

And there's a sense of doubt
When the roads are out
You say that you'll never be there

So button, button your lip

If you say "go"
There's a chance that we're running scared
When they say you'll never be there
In the dress that you'll never wear

So you button, you button your lip
And you button, you button your lip

We're on a hiding to nowhere
And they say that I won't answer you back

It's the dance that we'll never share
And the alarms that you can't do without
You're running scared
We're on a hiding to nowhere
