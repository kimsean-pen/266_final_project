The morning sunrise spread her wings
While the moon hung in the sky
Held the sea in your hands
And happy everafter in your eyes
Happy everyafter is in your eyes

Couldn't leave you to go to heaven
I carry you in my smile
For the first time my true reflection I see
Happy everafter in your eyes
Happy everafter is in your eyes

Every star in the night
Promises the dawn
I will be there if you fall
To ever so heavily rest upon

All that I can give you
Is forever yours to keep
Wake up every day with a dream
And happyever after in your eyes
Happy everafter is in your eyes
