I put my palms before her eyes
And she told me my truth
Laid the road for me
A rich man's destiny
But she saw it without you

She's a liar
She has no clue
You're the one thing I will not lose

I'll turn the tide
Pull down the moon
Run rivers dry
Battle fate for you
Let's burn the pages
We'll start anew
Right through the ages, to prove
Fate don't know you like I do
Like I do

I'm gonna make you feel my love
Leave you no room for doubt
No other hope for me
You're my destiny
Won't go nowhere without you

You're my fire
That much is true
You're the one thing I will not lose

I'll turn the tide
Pull down the moon
Run rivers dry
Battle fate for you
Let's burn the pages
We'll start anew
Right through the ages, to prove
Fate don't know you like I do
Like I do
Like I do

You're my fire
They have no clue
You're the one thing I will not lose
I will not lose

I'll turn the tide
Pull down the moon
Run rivers dry
Battle fate for you
Let's burn the pages
We'll start anew
Right through the ages
Fate don't know you like I do
Know you like I do
Fate don't know you like I do
