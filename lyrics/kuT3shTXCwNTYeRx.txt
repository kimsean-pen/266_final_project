You saw right through me, from the second you knew me
This worthless case has closed
I am broken for no reason but my own
On display, displeased
Ask for pain and you shall receive
But you saw right through me
If it's you, not me, then
Why do I feel so self-defeated
I'm leaving
Find me bleeding out the thought of you

Listen, I made the decision
I left you by the door, left you begging me to stay
I want nothing more
The way we used to speak
Went from aggressive to pathetic
Now apologetic fits my description

If it's you, not me, then
Why do I feel so self-defeated
I'm leaving
Find me bleeding out the thought of.
You keep dreaming
Keep pretending it's okay when I say
I'm leaving

I could've been all that you wanted
But you've taken me for granted
I could've been all that you wanted
Please constrict my breathing

Guess it's me then
Laying here so self-defeated
I'm leaving
Find me bleeding out the thought of.
You keep dreaming
Keep pretending it's okay when I say
I'm leaving
Find me bleeding out the thought of you

If it's you, not me, then
Why do I feel so self-defeated
