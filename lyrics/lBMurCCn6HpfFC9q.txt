If we lay it down, lay it deep
Then we can build high, high
If all we see are the ruins
Of our past, we
Can take the rubble and rebuild
And build high, high

What came before helps the new
Helps gather our tools used
To build high up with you
To build high up with you
High up with you

And we can light it how we like
To build high up with you
And we can dance in our light
To build high up with you

And we can light it how we like
Burn to start up again
And we can light it how we like
Learn to love to the end

(Light up for you)
New colors, new paths to fuse
(Light up)
We can dance in our light
(Light up for me)
Nothing ends, only new views
(Light up)
We can light it how we like

(Light up for me)
New colors, new paths to fuse
(Light up)
We can dance in our light
(Light up for you)
Nothing ends, only new views

So, still I follow
Still I follow
I hear your sound, it leads me
To build high up with you
High up with you

And we can light it how we like
To build high up with you
And we can dance in our light
To build high up with you

And we can light it how we like
Burn to start up again
And we can light it how we like
Learn to love to the end
(Light up for you)

And we can light it how we like
To build high up with you
And we can dance in our light
(Light up)
To build high up with you

And we can light it how we like
(Light up)
Burn to start up again
(Light up for me)
And we can light it how we like
(Light up)
Learn to love to the end

(Light up for you)
(Light up)
(Light up for me)
(Light up)
