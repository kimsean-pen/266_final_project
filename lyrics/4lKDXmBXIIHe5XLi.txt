Witheout or read your diary
Out loud
We've all read it anyway
Or just blackout the secrets
We're al dying in vain
There's a greyed out category in the spreadsheet
Where my name was supposed to be
"Promise to join us
Not to leave us
Take my hand now."

Know when to walk away
Know when to run
It's a sick cold dead place
We landed

In retrospect it all looks better
If you survive it

Get up each morning try, push, fight
It's just the same
It's cold
