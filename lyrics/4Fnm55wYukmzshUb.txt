Come forth defiled one
Command the swarming of flies
Let us pray
The womb of darkness will soon give birth

Contagious dysphoria
Asleep in rotten demise
Malediction awakes the ones absorbed by earth

I let the serpent crawl in
Crawling
Release me from vile faith
Nehebkau
I see you come with cold
I heard your name in tongues
Nehebkau

Enslaving the underworld
Bring cadavers to rise
Feed our minds with what was once foreseen

Bring death to year one
Reverse the closing of eyes
Insanity rules as god of light becomes unclean

Feed the undead
Invoke murder
Crush the forgery
Pray the light of day will never come again
