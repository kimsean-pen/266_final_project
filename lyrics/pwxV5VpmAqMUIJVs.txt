Care a less
I couldn't care a less
Such a mess

I know it's useless
I couldn't care a less
Care a less
I couldn't care a less

While my heart keeps returning
I am lost, I am weightless
With my arms by my side
I am hope, I can break this
I am rust, I am waiting
I am here, I am weightless
I am rust, rust

Care a less
I couldn't care a less
Care a less
I know it's useless
I couldn't care a less
Care a less
I know it's useless
Care a less
Couldn't care a less
I know it's you, I guess
Couldn't care a less
