So now you'll know exactly what it feels like
To be an obstacle in my way
You won't remain
You won't remain

Save your breath, don't even speak if you'll speak of change
Cause you won't, you won't
Cut to the chase, spare me the lecture on what it takes to make a man
Cause you're weak and I'm strong

I will never falter
I'll stand my ground
You're a fake, a worthless coward
Your life won't mean anything

I will never falter
I'll stand my ground
You're a fake, a worthless coward
Your life won't mean anything

So now you'll know exactly what it feels like
To be an obstacle in my way
You won't remain
You won't remain

Let's set things straight what's done is done, I never needed you
Tell me exactly, who do you think that you're kidding?
Everyone will be happy when they find that you're missing
You asked if we'd ever forget you
We've got our fingers crossed, our fingers crossed

That's the danger in starting a fire
You'll never know how many bridges you'll burn
That's the danger in starting a fire
You'll never know how many bridges you'll burn
