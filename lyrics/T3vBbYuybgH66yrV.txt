Tired of waiting on you
After all we've been through

If you want me still
I know I can do for you
Anything you want me to
Why don't you come see about me?

Come see about me, baby
Come see about me

Time is wasting away
After all, it's been a long day
If you want me still
I know I can do for you
Anything you want me to
Why don't you come see about me?

Come see about me, baby
Come see about me

If you want me still
I know I can do for you
Anything you want me to
Why don't you come see about me?

Come see about me, baby
Come see about me

Come see about me, baby
Come see about me

Come see about me, baby
Come see about me
Come see about me
