Are we disco dancing?
Or throwing shapes in an empty space?
All eyes on me
Here we go now
When I'm done dancing with myself
I wanna move with you
Do you want to too?
Is there something better
(Something better, something better)
Than me? No
There's nothing better
(Nothing better, nothing better)
Than me

Never gonna lose that wonder, fall under your control
Go out and paint the world
Make it gold

With tears in my eyes and love in my soul
I feel like starting something
The pain it subsides the minute I go

With tears in my eyes
A love in my soul
I feel like starting something
The pain it subsides
The minute I go
I feel like starting something gold
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
I feel like starting something gold (La-la-la)
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
Don't you feel like starting something?

Are we really real?
Or a character from a film?
That I saw last year
The cameras focusing on you
It should be focusing on me
it would be better

Never gonna lose that wonder, fall under your control
Go out and get the girl
And paint her gold

With tears in my eyes
A love in my soul
I feel like starting something
The pain it subsides
The minute I go
I feel like starting something gold
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
I feel like starting something gold (La-la-la)
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
Don't you feel like starting something?

We all get lost on our way to the dream
But we have to believe we are going somewhere better
Somewhere gold, gold
Never gonna lose that wonder, fall under your control
Go out and paint the world
And make it gold

I feel like starting something
The pain it subsides
The minute I go
I feel like starting something gold
(La-la-la) something gold
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
I feel like starting something gold (La-la-la)
(La-la-la) something gold
La-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
I feel like starting something gold

I feel like starting something gold
