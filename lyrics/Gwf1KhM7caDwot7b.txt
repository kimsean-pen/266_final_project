Think I'm really falling, think I'm in so deep
When you say my name, sounds obscene
I wanna be the girl of your dreams
Think I'm really falling, think I'm in so deep
When you say my name, sounds obscene
I wanna be the girl of your dreams
Not just a face you come for in a magazine
I'm more than fast cars,
Frette sheets
Champagne, weak knees

There's a price for passion,
I'm living in luxury
Top tier desire, that's my currency
There's a price for passion,
I'm living in luxury
Top tier desire, that's my currency

Girlfriend, girlfriend experience
Girlfriend, girlfriend tonight, uh oh oh oh
Girlfriend, girlfriend experience
Girlfriend, girlfriend tonight, uh oh oh oh

Don't get me wrong, I love my Goyard
Don't have to leave for LA for Bungalow 8
Wanna be the girl, girl of your dreams
Not just a face you come for in a magazine
I'm more than fast cars,
Frette sheets
Champagne, skin deep

There's a price for passion,
I'm living in luxury
Top tier desire, that's my currency
There's a price for passion,
I'm living in luxury
Top tier desire, that's my currency

Girlfriend, girlfriend experience
Girlfriend, girlfriend tonight, uh oh oh oh
Girlfriend, girlfriend experience
Girlfriend, girlfriend tonight, uh oh oh oh
