A nation built on sweat
A nation built on blood
A nation built on dreams
Before the tongues are mute
Before they hide the truth
We'll be the ones who speak

A nation, a nation
A struggle, a struggle
A weapon, a weapon
Our music!

One mantra, one mantra
One prayer, one prayer
One belief, one belief
All gods!

We see without our eyes
We walk without a path
We fight with unity
Search for a better way
Change what's been done before
Make our own history

Rise up, rise up
Resistance won't be stopped
Rise up, rise up
Sepulnation

Rise, rise
Corruption undisguised
Rise, rise
Sepulnation

Confronting with our minds
Destroying all the lies
Unmasked by purity
Burning the eyes of greed
No fear, no disbelief
Our faith is your misery

A nation, a nation
A struggle, a struggle
A weapon, a weapon
Our music!

One mantra, one mantra
One prayer, one prayer
One belief, one belief
All gods!

Rise up, rise up
Resistance won't be stopped
Rise up, rise up
Sepulnation

Rise, rise
Corruption undisguised
Rise, rise
Sepulnation

One nation above all
Founded on our faith
One nation above all
Founded on our faith
