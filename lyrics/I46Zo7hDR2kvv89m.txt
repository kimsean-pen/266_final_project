I haven't seen you for months again
And it feels like a couple of years
And everything you said
It's just running through my head
Like a cooped up animal

Aggressive fires on every tire
That drives straight to your feet
But you chucked me in the back
All tied up in a sack
But the solitude suits me

You left me high and you left me dry
Then you fed me to the wolves
There's something to be said
To be woken from the dead
Separate the flies from fools

Did you get tired of making lies up
Or is it who you are?
You're falling from the cracks
Throwing out your God complex
But you won't get very far

Oh you're never gonna make me cry
Oh you're never gonna make me cry
Oh you're never gonna make me cry
Oh you're never gonna make me cry
