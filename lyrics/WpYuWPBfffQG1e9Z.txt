I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you just give me a chance, you'd see what I see
Do you see what I see?

It's your fault
Baby boy, 'cause you're the one that sparked this
Shine a light with your eyes onto me in the darkness

Hey, Joe's calling me over
Tino is calling me over
I only came here for you
It's you boy, you in the corner
Something is taking me over
I only came here for you

I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you just give me a chance, you'd see what I see
Do you see what I see?

I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you just give me a chance, you'd see what I see
Do you see what I see?
I didn't just come here to dance

Baby I, I'm not going anywhere without you
Drive me home 'cause I like every single thing about you

Hey, Joe's calling me over
Tino is calling me over
I only came here for you
It's you boy, you in the corner
Something is taking me over
I only came here for you

I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you just give me a chance, you'd see what I see
Do you see what I see?

I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you just give me a chance, you'd see what I see
Do you see what I see?
I didn't just come here to dance

Hey, Joe's calling me over
Tino is calling me over
I only came here for you
It's you boy, you in the corner
Something is taking me over
I only came here for you

I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean?
If you just give me a chance, you'd see what I see
Do you see what I see?
