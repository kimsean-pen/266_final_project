Saucy, saucy, so damn bossy
Pussy creaming in his coffee
Guaranteed he 'bout to stalk me
If he's walkie, we can't talkie, nope
These bitches washed up, Dove soap
They pockets on fizz, call it broke
Poking at my ass just to make these bitches mad
Might bag a nigga like a tote
Fresh air going through my hair
I don't care, bitch, I'm just ridin'
It's that 24/7 grinding
Now we pulling more strings than zip-lining
Fix that "I don't wanna go back"
Recycled moonwalk 'cause shit could get violent
Fix that, lemme call you right back
I'm with my side nigga
Then put phone on silent
'Cause I'm nobody's bae, snap out of the days
Find your way out like you up in a maze
Switching up niggas 'cause they like the play
So all I do is con these niggas like Ye
Don't know shit about me I stay low
Got whores on me and I got hay loaves
Ain't up on nobody payroll
'Cause my attitude nasty like Monroe

Tropical, tropical, tropical
Bitch I am sicker than most of these hospitals
I am cold with the stick like a popsicle
Try to clown me I'ma Ronald McDonald you, yeah
Tropical, tropical, tropical
Bitch I am sicker than most of these hospitals
I am cold with the stick like a popsicle
Try to clown me I'ma Ronald McDonald you (Donald you)

Clown your ass to the fullest
Like bitch, your ass ain't the fullest
You can't ever make me look foolish
'Cause my bank account look the fullest
My withdrawals be the fullest
My withdrawals be the fullest
The only thing you draw is them eyebrows
And them bitches still ain't the fullest

Raspberry timbs man, these bitches is bloody
I don't wear Uggs man, them bitches is ugly
Your finger empty but you call him "hubby"
Bitch you a mother, motherfucking dummy
You don't understand life
You arrow chicken, get it fried
You a broken car with no drive
You not a you no more, you a "why?"
Put a dot on your head like a lowercase 'I'
Bullets hit males and females, it's bi
High like the desert, but life never dry
I ain't talking to no cops just tell 'em I'm shy
Why your numbers going down like a tracklist
I spend that money then I shit doing backflips
We not alike so you shouldn't double tap this
Drop my body in two seconds like I'm a baptist
Rest in peace under my mattress
Bitches dead to me, I'm smoking they ashes
Niggas ain't savage
They dick ain't even longer than they bitch lashes
Had to bring choppers
The tree I was under was so fucking shady
Now money stuffing up my wallet
So you know damn well that I'm gravy

Tropical, tropical, tropical
Bitch I am sicker than most of these hospitals
I am cold with the stick like a popsicle
Try to clown me I'ma Ronald McDonald you, yeah
Tropical, tropical, tropical
Bitch I am sicker than most of these hospitals

Try to clown me I'ma Ronald McDonald you (Donald you)

Clown your ass to the fullest
Like bitch, your ass ain't the fullest
You can't ever make me look foolish
'Cause my bank account look the fullest
My withdrawals be the fullest

The only thing you draw is them eyebrows
And them bitches still ain't the fullest
