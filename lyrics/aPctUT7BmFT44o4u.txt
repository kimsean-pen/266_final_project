I was biding my time
Desperately, I walked the line
Between health and poverty
Looked into a face and
My thoughts they were replaced
I had the nerve to call it soul

Get love where you find it
It's the only fist we have to fight with
And soon you're headed back to earth

Found myself along a path
Traced all my steps back
Found a place to relearn to relax
Rested like an empty cage and
Where the moon starts everyday
And I can dress up like a saint

Get love where you find it
It's the only fist we have to fight with
And soon you're headed back to earth

Twice I've been around the world and I'm sure
There ain't no one living no more
No choice but to buy all your own time
Spend all your money at the casket store

Get love where you find it
It's the only fist we have to fight with
And soon you're headed back to earth
