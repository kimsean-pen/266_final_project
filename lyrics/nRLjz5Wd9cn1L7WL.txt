Billy was a boy who lost his mind
Cooked out on LSD
Sherri was almost seventeen
And knocked up with number 3

Javi lost everything he owned
selling Jesus door to door
Gina woke up in Baltimore
It was about that time to score

You put me back in line
You made me realize
I wanna be a better man so I can love you right

You're my streetlight
Shining. Pour your light on me
You're like sunlight
Blinding. So bright that I can't see
You're my streetlight
Shining. Darkness fades away
You're like sunlight
Smiling. Yellow orange rays

Timmy couldn't sleep without his pills
His mind was on the brink (on the brink, on the brink)
Debbie got down with anyone
Who would pay for all her drinks (Sip it down, girl)

Nicki wouldn't let you close to her
Unless you ran on batteries (double A, double A)
Danny! Danny!
Danny ain't got no daddy!

You put me back in line
You made me realize
I wanna be a better man so I can love you right

You're my streetlight
Shining. Pour your light on me
You're like sunlight
Blinding. So bright that I can't see
You're my streetlight
Shining. Darkness fades away
You're like sunlight
Smiling. Yellow orange rays

All I see is sun
Rays pour down from up above
You've got what I want
I don't have to put up a front

You're my streetlight
Shining. Pour your light on me
You're like sunlight
Blinding. So bright that I can't see
You're my streetlight
Shining. Darkness fades away
You're like sunlight
Smiling. Yellow orange rays
