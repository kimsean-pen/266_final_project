You spoke a word, life began
Told oceans where to start and where to end
You set in motion time and space
But still you come and you're calling me by name
Still you come and you're calling me by name

If you can know the stars in place
You can know my heart the same
Whenever I fall away
Whenever I start to break
So here I am, lifting up my heart
To the one who holds the stars

The deepest steps, the darkest nights
Can't separate, can't keep me from you side
I get so lost, forget my way
But still you love and you don't forget my name

If you can know the stars in place
You can know my heart the same
Whenever I fall away
Whenever I start to break
So here I am, lifting up my heart

If you can calm the raging sea
You can calm the storm in me
Never to fall away
You never show up too late
So here I am, lifting up my heart
To the one who holds the stars

No love has called my name
What do I have to fear?
What do I have to fear?
No love has called my name
What do I have to fear?
What do I have to fear?

If you can know the stars in place
You can know my heart the same
Whenever I fall away
Whenever I start to break
So here I am, lifting up my heart
(Lifting up my heart)

If you can calm the raging sea
You can calm the storm in me
Never to fall away
You never show up too late
So here I am, lifting up my heart
To the one who holds the stars

You're the one who holds the stars
