I Picture You In The Sun
Wondering
What Went Wrong
And Falling Down On Your Knees
Asking For
Sympathy
And Being Caught In Between
All You Wish For
And All You Seen
And Trying To Find Anything
You Can Feel
That You Can Believe In

May God's Love Be With You
Always
May God's Love Be With You

I Know I Would Apologize
If I Could
See Your Eyes
'Cause When You Showed Me Myself You Know
I Became
Someone Else
But I Was Caught In Between
All You Wish For And All You Need
I Picture You Fast Asleep
A Nightmare Comes
You Can't Keep Away

May God's Love Be With You
Always
May God's Love Be With You
Always
May God's Love Be With You
Always
May God's Love Be With You

'Cause If I Find
If I Find My Own Way
How Much Will I Find?
If I Find
If I Find My Own Way
How Much Will I Find?
If I Find
If I Find My Own Way
How Much Will I Find?
You You I'll Find you You

Well I Don't Know Anymore
What Its For
I'm Not Even Sure
If There Is Anyone
Who Is In The Sun
Will You Help Me To Understand
'Cause I Been Caught In Between
All I Wish For And All I Need
Maybe You're Not Even Sure
What It's For
Anymore Than Me

May God's Love Be With You
Always
May God's Love Be With You
Always
May God's Love Be With You
Always
May God's Love Be With You

'Cause If I Find
If I Find My Own Way
How Much Will I Find?
If I Find
If I Find My Own Way
How Much Will I Find?
'Cause If I Find
If I Find My Own Way
How Much Will I Find?
If I Find
If I Find My Own Way
How Much Will I Find?
You You I'll Find You,
You, I'll Find You, You,
I'll find You, You
