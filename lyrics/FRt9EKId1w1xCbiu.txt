Yeah, rock solid nigga Solid as a motherfuckin' rock, bitch Yeah, nigga When you fall, who you gon' land on? Niggas foundation is shaky, ain't shit to stand on
A man's born with the only guarantee to live and die
But will I die before I live, 'fore I begin to fly?
Nigga, I can't deny when I'm not high, I miss that rush, that shit be callin' me
Demons never rest, I go to sleep, them bitches follow me
I just bought a AR for my dog, he walked the dog for me
Breakfast, sip promethazine with Ocean Spray and Broccoli
Catch these hoes and I act like I can't keep these bitches off of me
They only fuckin' a nigga that got the most dollars in his Squadary
I went to visit my nigga, he caught him a charge, his cards was fraudulent
Time to go get me some yayo, I know that Andrea gon' lease that car for me
That Bentley Benz or Beamer, shippin' B's, I don't be in it
Not to let these bitches see me in it, fuck the ceilin'
Nigga wanna be me, wish he could see the G in him
She work in the mornin', get that pussy in the PM
I get in it then I jet it, it was a fly by, red bottoms, the thigh high
And every time she see me, she's sayin' I don't know why I
Fuck with niggas like you 'cause at first, you would play the shy guy
Give me that pussy once and I always got it like the Wi-Fi, bitch
I went to visit my nigga, he caught him a charge, his cards was fraudulent
Time to go get me some yayo, I know that Andrea gon' lease that car for me
I remember when Dukie lost his arm in fuckin' armed robbery
When I seen his shit was danglin', almost felt my heart stoppin' G
Stop it G, drop it G, so much weed, forgot to breathe
Some niggas take the trip I took but they don't get to leave
Came out that bitch, speakin' Russian, German, Guapanese
Can't let these niggas stunt my growth from livin' for my seed Level up, I'm on a stage, I gotta get paid I can never be a slave for minimum wage
Cop an ounce up off the way, you fill 'em with K's
Level up, I'm on a stage, I gotta get paid Level up, I'm on a stage, I gotta get paid
I can never be a slave for minimum wage Cop an ounce up off the way, you fill 'em with K's
Level up, I'm on a stage, I gotta get paid Shit, momma always told 'me' go and get your own shit
Coke in front of me nothin', so I got my own shit
Dope and cocaine powder, off in to their own shit
I been tryna fuck her for a month but she ain't on shit
Start to make a nigga feel like I D'in' the wrong bitch
Skip the introduction I just hit her with that long dick
Try to drop the 50 pointer and get my phone lit
Niggas looking for the, for the shit Niggas always talkin' 'bout their bitches ain't shit
Caught a charge, my baby mama, she was solid as a brick

Harden niggas I was feedin' man, givin' a nigga shit
Momma always told me nigga go and get your own shit
Toilet right next to my bed, I'm sleeping by my own shit
Dope and cocaine powder, off in to their own shit
I just dropped a 50 pointer and got my phone lit Got my phone lit
