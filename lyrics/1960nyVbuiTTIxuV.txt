XO XO, my love is very special
If you want it you can have it
But don't take me for granted
So much, so much
So much things I did not say
I'm from Portmore that's in J.A.
We can do it on that beach deh

Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock
Bruk it, set it
Bruk it, set it
Bruk it, set it
Bruk it, set it

Backshot, somehow you got
Headstrong, forget mi not
When it sweet you
Weh you say?
(Bap bap bap bap bap bap)

Fever

Whine fi mi baby, everything criss
My good love make you turn and twist

Fever

Whine fi mi baby, everything criss

When you look back a yuh
A me that
Doggystyle, puppy whisper
My cocky so hot, it give the fire fever
If yuh caah bruck it off, Hasta La Vista
Gyal haffi have a, pussy power
Grab it, let go

Go dung, lover
Go dung, go back

Wide out, like a sheetspread
Likkle twelve lef' Dex, dat mash up him head
Kahira, gi' him a third world girl instead

Rev her body
Send her cousin
Come a Addi
When mi done
She haffi say, "Daddy!"
