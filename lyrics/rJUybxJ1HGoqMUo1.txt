By the time I was your age, I'd give anything
to fall in love truly was all I could think
That's when I met your mother, the girl of my dreams
the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen.

She said, "boy can I tell you a wonderful thing?
I can't help but notice you staring at me
I know I shouldn't say this, but I really believe
I can tell by your eyes that you're in love with me."

Now son, I'm only telling you this because life can do terrible things.

Now most of the time we'd have too much to drink and we'd laugh at the stars and we'd share everything
Too young to notice and too dumb to care
love was a story that couldn't compare.

I said, "girl can I tell you a wonderful thing?
I made you a present with paper and string
open with care now, I'm asking you please
you know that I love you will you marry me?"

Now son, I'm only telling you this because life can do terrible things
You'll learn one day, and I hope and I pray that God shows you differently.

She said, "boy can I tell you a terrible thing?
It seems that I'm sick and I've only got weeks
Please don't be sad now, I really believe
you were the greatest thing that ever happened to me."

Slow, so slow, I fell to the ground on my knees
So don't fall in love there's just too much to lose
If you're given the choice then I'm begging you choose to walk away, walk away
Don't let it get you, I can't bare to see the same happen to you.

Now son, I'm only telling you this because life can do terrible things.
