I was waiting in the back-seat of the car, when I knew i'd given up
Down one of the back-streets by the park, so sick of the taste of blood
I'm gonna write your girl a letter, it'll make everything better

Screaming down the phone-line to your mum, she said "Honey ain't home right now"
I bought a tuxedo and I bought a gun, and wore them all around this town
Nobody dares to lift a finger, they can see my heart is down and injured

If i'm guilty of anything, its loving you too much
Honey, sometimes love...
Means getting a little rough
This is not bad love, this is not bad love

I've been going to church but I don't believe
I'll ever be clear this pain
Walk like a ghost through the streets
Soaked from the pouring rain
And I won't ask your god for mercy...
My spirits are low, my soul is dirty

If i'm guilty of anything, its loving you too much
Honey, sometimes love...
Means getting a little rough
This is not bad love, this is not bad love

If i'm guilty of anything, its loving you too much
Honey, sometimes love...
Means getting a little rough
This is not bad love, this is not bad love
If i'm guilty of anything, its loving you too much
Honey, sometimes love...
Means getting a little rough
This is not bad love, this is not bad love
