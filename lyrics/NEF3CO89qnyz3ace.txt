Paradoxical vision, mind's imprisoned
Rain on my terrain
Colloquial tongue coming in my ears hedonistic pain

Don't shed a tear
Please don't fear, we all feel ashamed
Don't shed a tear
Please don't fear, we all feel ashamed

Moonlight gleaming, the viper first screaming
Dawn is nearly there
Phallic building, cyanide killings all that was good
Find an antidote for this accumulated smoke
Find an antidote for all this accumulating smoke

Don't shed a tear, we all feel shame, we all feel shame
Don't shed a tear, we all feel shame, we all feel shame
Don't shed a tear, we all feel shame, we all feel shame
Don't shed a tear, we all feel shame, we all feel shame
Don't shed a tear, we all feel shame, we all feel shame
Don't shed a tear, we all feel shame, we all feel shame
Don't shed a tear, we all feel shame, we all feel shame
Don't shed a tear, we all feel shame, we all feel shame
Don't shed a tear, we all feel shame, we all feel shame
Don't shed a tear, we all feel shame, we all feel shame
Don't shed a tear, we all feel shame, we all feel shame
Don't shed a tear, we all feel shame, we all feel shame
Don't shed a tear, we all feel shame, we all feel shame
