Rewriting the definitions
Of what went wrong and what should have been
Countless, useless, miserable and scared
And a pair of bottles in our hands to dig our own graves

But the flowers they won't bloom over the boxes we'll live in
Spring's gone
Where is the cash?
I've got a thirst to quench and nothing but a dime
I've buried myself under unnamed regrets
Don't nail the last planks
I've got questions to ask
I forgot a lot of details and don't know where to start
The hammer stopped and it all turned black

And when the shovel's gone it ain't never coming back
Weary and reckless I've been counting the shadows
Before the first rats and worms knock at the door
We were all meant for more
Blaming the bottle but not the throat

Watch your step kid cause it's you against the world
And the fire in your eyes it can also be your biggest curse
I hate farewells
I hate farewells
I'm shaking hands in a world of snakes
"Good bye. Forget. The privilege is to follow"
Mine has always been to be the first step in the snow
