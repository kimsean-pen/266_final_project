If I told you
Heaven knows
Got me spinning from my head down to my toes
Oh...
Without warning I'm exposed
And my heart misses a beat when you're so close
Oh...

And then Love Comes in a heartbeat
Love Comes and you can't breathe
oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh)
And then Love Comes in a heartbeat
Love Comes and you can't sleep
oh oh oh oh oh oh heartbeat heartbeat-beat-beat

Caught a rainbow
A ray of light
With your kisses and caresses
Your delight
Oh...
I have waited to justify
This love we have
It cannot be denied
Oh...

And then Love Comes in a heartbeat
Love Comes and you can't breathe
oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh)
And then Love Comes in a heartbeat
Love Comes and you can't sleep
oh oh oh oh oh oh Heartbeat Heartbeat-beat-beat-beat

Memories past are bitter sweet
Faded fast now you're with me
You're with me

And then Love Comes in a heartbeat
Love Comes and you can't breathe
oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh)
And then Love Comes in a heartbeat
Love Comes and you can't sleep
oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh)
And then Love Comes
Love Comes
Love Comes
Love Comes
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Heartbeat Heartbeat-beat-beat-beat
Oh
