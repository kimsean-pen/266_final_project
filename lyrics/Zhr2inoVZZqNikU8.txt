I was only ten years old
Like the back of my hand, knew the roads
I swerved my bike and lost control
Over the handles in the air
A lady who came walking by found me lying there
And the nurse at the hospital said

"Little boy, don't be scared
Now your father is waiting in the next room
Little boy, don't be sad
Now your mom's on her way, you'll be out of here soon"

Mmh, mmh

We drove so slowly through these streets
In the suburbs of our dreams, mmh
At night my father closed his eyes
He saw the new car in the drive
My mother standing in the doorway
Friday night, a smile on her face
And the voice I can hear in my head

"Little boy, don't be scared
Now you know we'll be sleeping in the next room
Little boy, don't be sad
Now tomorrow is as it is coming 'round soon"

Mmh
Mmh

We only need a little space
Just somewhere we could call our place
My mother standing in the doorway
Friday night, a smile on her face
These things always start so small
With no applause and no drum roll
And I came running up the hallway
See the car turn in the driveway

Mmh

And I'll always be that little boy
And I've always been that little boy
Yeah, I'll always be that little boy
And I'll always be that little boy
