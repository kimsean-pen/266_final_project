Will you remember the dress I wore?
Will you remember my face?
Will you remember the lipstick I wore?
This world is a wonderful place
Will you remember the black limousine?
Will you remember champa-a-agne?
Will you remember the things that we see?
I will return here again

Will you remember the flowers in my hand?
Will you remember my ha-a-air?
Will you remember the future we planned?
The world is not waiting out there

I won't remember the dress I wore
I won't remember champa-a-agne
I won't remember the things that we swore
I will just love you in vain

Will you remember?
Will you recall?
Will you remember?
