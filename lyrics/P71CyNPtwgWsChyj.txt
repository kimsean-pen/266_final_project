Movin' in, travelin'
Boxes on the open floor

And if I lied, it was only a disguise
All to hide what you want to know, oh

I negate
Don't you want to run again?
Don't you want to?
Don't you want to?
Don't you want to?

I walk in, and in
Waiting by an open door

And if I try, to look you in the eyes
I don't see what I saw before

I negate
Don't you want to run again?
Don't you want to?
Don't you want to?
Don't you want to?

Don't you want to?
Don't you want to?
Don't you want to?
