So much pain
But still you can breathe
I asked to stay
But all you do is leave

Keep staring at you
Alone in the crowd
Free from the noise
The silence gets louder, louder

And honestly I want to be a part of this
In between the layers of your loneliness
Is where I feel you need

I'll be here (I'll be here)
I'll be here (I'll be here)
I'll be here, here, here, here, here, here
I'll be here (I'll be here)
I'll be

I'll be here
I'll be here
I'll be here
I'll be here

The space between
Will slowly disappear
I'll be here
I'll be here
(I'll be here)
(I'll be here)
(I'll be here)
