Babe, why don't you talk to me?
We're acting so damn differently
And I've been giving everything
'Cause I don't wanna let you down

Type it out but never send
'Cause I don't know if I could bend
And I don't wanna see the end
'Cause I just needed you around

Breathe slow, someone help me breathe slow
I can't be my hero every single time

You're the one that fucked up
But I'm the one that's missing you
You're the one that's all right
But I'm the one that's going through hell
Trying to keep myself together
'Cause I hate me when we're not together
You're the one that fucked up
But I'm the one that's missing you, yeah

Babe, why aren't we listening
I swore to God, I'd let you in
And I've been giving everything
'Cause I don't wanna let it go

I know we aren't the same love
But I'm giving the same love
And I don't wanna give it up
'Cause we aren't meant to be alone

Breathe slow, someone help me breathe slow
I can't be my hero every single time, yeah

You're the one that fucked up
But I'm the one that's missing you
You're the one that's all right
But I'm the one that's going through hell
Trying to keep myself together
'Cause I hate me when we're not together
You're the one that fucked up
But I'm the one that's missing you, yeah

If I told you the ways that I need you
If I told you the ways that I bleed through
If I told you I can't get enough

If I told you the ways that I need you
If I told you the ways that I bleed through
If I'm giving you all of my love

Babe, why don't you talk to me?
We're acting so damn differently
And I've been giving everything
'Cause I don't wanna let you down

You're the one that fucked up
But I'm the one that's missing you
You're the one that's all right
But I'm the one that's going through hell
Trying to keep myself together
'Cause I hate me when we're not together
You're the one that fucked up
But I'm the one that's missing you, yeah

If I told you the ways that I need you
If I told you the ways that I bleed through
If I told you I can't get enough
No, I can't get enough

If I told you the ways that I need you
If I told you the ways that I bleed through
If I'm giving you all of my love, yeah
