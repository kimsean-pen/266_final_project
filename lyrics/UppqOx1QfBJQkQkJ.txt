Yeahh yeah
That little ringin' buzzin' good for nothin' phone in your hands
The directions to the party that's just started with that cover band
That old school radio station
Let's just drive until it's faded
Girl, let's lose it, tonight

'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flippin' your hair, baby, I swear
I don't think you know what you're doin' to me, you got
My heart skip-skippin' a beat tonight
Close enough 'til there's no space between

You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind

Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Ugh
Yeah, I lose it

Let's start with them Luke Caseys, baby, kick 'em to the floorboard
And bobby pins holdin' your hair up, girl, you don't need 'em no more
That dress hangin' off your shoulder as you move a little closer
Yeah, let's lose it, tonight ya girl

I don't think you know what you're doin' to me, you got
My heart skip-skippin' a beat tonight
You're not close enough to there's space between
You and me, let's lose it

The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Whoo
Yeah, I lose it

'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flippin' your hair, baby, I swear (baby I swear, baby I swear) eh
I don't think you know what you're doin' to me, you got
My heart skip-skippin' a beat tonight
You're not close enough 'til there's no space between

You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind

Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

Yeahhh, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
