What! Never say what you mean, all I hear is scream
Never say that to me
Never say that to me
Wait! Wipe that shit off your face, let's don't stop till we bleed
The more you spit out your mouth the less I believe

Denial seems it had to come
Relied on me to say it all
Denial has left you all alone

I! Can all that shit that you said, ever make any sense?
Where did you run to (bitch)
While I was holding my breath?
What's sacred faded into nothing
Never put that on me, never put that on me

Denial seems it had to come
Relied on me to say it all
Denial has left you all alone
Denial seems it had to come
Relied on me to say it all
Denial has left you all alone
Waste

Denial seems it had to come
Relied on me to say it all
Denial has left you all alone
Denial seems it had to come
Relied on me to say it all
Denial has left you all alone
