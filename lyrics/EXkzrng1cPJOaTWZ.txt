I was laughing
Playing in the streets, I was unknowing
I didn't know my fate

Playing
The game of love but never really showing
I thought that love would wait

I was a young man and I was sure to go astray
You walked right into my life and told me, 'love would find a way'

Keep on growing, keep on going, keep on flowing

I was standing
Looking at the face of one who loved me
Feeling so ashamed

Hoping
Praying, Lord, that she could understand me
But I didn't know her name

She took my hand in hers and then told me I was wrong
She said, 'You're gonna be alright, boy, whoa, just as long.'

Keep on growing, keep on going, keep on flowing
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby

Baby
Someday, baby, who knows where or when, girl
Just you wait and see

We'll be walking
Together hand in hand alone as lovers
Will it still be me?

Times gonna change us, Lord, and I know it's true
Our love's gonna keep on glowing
And growing is all we're gonna do

Keep on growing, keep on glowing, keep on flowing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
