I'm still remembering the day
I gave my life away
I'm still remembering the time
You said you'd be mine
Yesterday was cold and bare
Because you were not there
Yesterday was cold
My story has been told

I need your affection all the way
The world has changed or I've changed in a way
I try to remain
I'm trying not to go insane
I need your affection all the way

I'm still remembering my life
Before I became your wife
I'm still remembering the pain
And the mind games
Re psychology, never tainted me
I didn't sell my soul, I didn't sell my soul

I need your affection all the way
The world has changd or I've changed in a way
I try to remain
I'm trying not to go insane
I need your affection all the way

They say the cream will always
Rise to the top
They say that good people
Are always first to drop
What of Kurt Cobain
Will his presence still remain
Remember J.F.K.
Ever saintly in a way

Where are you now
Where are you now
Where are you now
I say, where are you now

I need your affection all the way
I need your affection all the way
I need your affection all the way
I need your affection all the way
