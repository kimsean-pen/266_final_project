But I could be more
Isn't there more?
Don't you dream of forgetting this?
Have we forgotten what we want?
Counting the wars and broken bones
Haven't we lost enough already?
Isn't this more than what it's worth?
Have we forgotten where we came from?
Long way from laying in the dirt
And if I can only dream of up from down there
God, help me, I'll be gone

Have I lost sight of everything I've worked for?
Did I get this all wrong?
