Ain't nothing new nigga, just something new

I never trust faith with my trust funds
I keep it in a safe place nigga, lump sum
Camera surveillance a bunch of fucking stun guns
I'm a snare to the drum, burum-ba-bum
Her bird's a hummer, son, I show her how we drum a drum
She doesn't come for me, the bitch only say she come for fun
What's up honey bun, wanna feel your tummy rum?
Rumbling in a ring with pills to fucking numb
Your system is my fucking dick dome
Feel the friction of my children with down syndrome
I'm rehearsin' for my funeral, triple six Roman numerals
MellowHype musical, talking to wolves like Doolittle
Think with a migraine like a fucking eye strain
Drink bottles of champagne on a fucking biplane
If it doesn't add up then ask the students my name
I'm fucking Einstein, I'm sane

Knock, knock! Delivery, I'm the rhetorician
Body decomposition, rippin' through your rhythms
I suggest you stop and listen to this non-prescription
Fuck your contradiction, this my composition
Knock, knock! Delivery, I'm the rhetorician
Body decomposition, rippin' through your rhythms
I suggest you stop and listen to this non-prescription
Fuck your contradiction, this my composition

Leprechaun, hexagon, I transform, Decepticon
Rasputin, I'm half mutant, fuck financial aid, cash students
I'm too pursuant to over-do shit, super fluent
My flow is overheated, it needs coolin', shit
Fuck being poor to return to the school and shoot it up
While I shoot it like a porno bitch with cool whip
I dive scuba, barracuda, shark water in Cuba
Chicken head of the sea, but I don't fuckin' eat tuna
I sneak her in my room like Puma
My bedroom's Jerusalem and I'm Judah, suck on my messiah
Or die and cry a fire, truth is the curse of liars
So is Mrs. Doubtfire, fat bitches, dope beats
Is what my niggas acquire, if you're broke, get the cash
Bitch I'm dope, do the math, triple six sipping through a golden flask
Salute Mellowhype or mustard gas, I ain't gay but I'm a fuckin' ass

Knock, knock! Delivery, I'm the rhetorician
Body decomposition, rippin' through your rhythms
I suggest you stop and listen to this non-prescription
Fuck your contradiction, here's my composition
Knock, knock! Delivery, I'm the rhetorician
