I watch you from afar
Can't reach your burning star
Still I will keep you safe in my sight
I know we hardly speak
But your words I can complete
I have built you up too high to talk you down

And I won't let go
I won't let go of you
There's no limit to my love
No limit to my love
I won't let go my love

Can't step over the line
And you don't give me any sign
So I will take a deep breath and rise up
I live unnaturally
Half with you half with me
All my words lay wasted at your feet

And I won't let go
I won't let go of you
There's no limit to my love
No limit to my love
I won't let go my love

Can't you see I'm waiting for you to come back to me
I never left you only you can choose what you wanna see
What can I do I'm still in love with you

And I won't let go
I won't let go of you
There's no limit to my love
No limit to my love
I won't let go my love

There's no limit to my love
No limit to my love
I won't let go my love

And I won't let go
And I won't let go
And I won't let go
And I won't let go of you
