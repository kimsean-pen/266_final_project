Everybody's got to love someone sometime
(Everybody's got to love someone sometime)
Everybody's got to love someone sometime
(Everybody's got to love someone sometime)

Far far far form the everyday
Shine me a light to a different way
I wanna move when I wanna wanna move YA
I wanna groove when I wanna wanna groove YA

I think that I'm gonna break it, and break it, and break it, break it, break it, break it down!

One life forever. You put it in your pocket and you save it for a rainy day
One life forever. You put it in your pocket and you know that it'll grow a tree
One life forever. You're never gonna see it but you're never gonna really say
Oh oh! These people aren't people they're just people getting in the way

Everybody's got to love someone sometime
(Everybody's got to love someone sometime)
Everybody's got to love someone sometime
(Everybody's got to love someone sometime)

What is it that's makin' me thirsty?
What is it that's takin' it from me?
What is it leaving the light on... but locking the door?

One life forever. You put it in your pocket and you save it for a rainy day
One life forever. You put it in your pocket and you know that it'll grow a tree
One life forever. You're never gonna see it but you're never gonna really say
Oh oh! These people aren't people they're just people getting in the way
