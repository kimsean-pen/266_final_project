coming from where he did
he was turned away from
every door like joseph
to even the toughest among us
that would be too much
he didn't know what it was
to be black
'til they gave him his change but didn't want to touch
his hand
to even the toughest among us
that would be too much

isn't it just enough
how hard it is to live
isn't it hard enough
just to make it through a day

the secret of their fear
and their suspicion
standing there looking
like an angel
in his brown shoes
his short suit
his white shirt
and his cuffs a little frayed
coming from where he did
he was such a dignified child
to even the toughest among us
that would be too much

isn't it just enough
how hard it is to live
isn't it hard enough
just to make it through a day

coming from where he did
he was turned away from
every door like joseph
to even the toughest among us
that would be too much
he didn't know what it
was to be black
'til they gave him his change but didn't want to touch
his hand
to even the toughest among us
that would be too much
