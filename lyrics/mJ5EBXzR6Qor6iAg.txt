From the moment you said, "Why haven't you kissed me yet?"
I knew I'd wipe that paint from your lips
I stare the lids off your eyes
Goin' down on your dirty mind and end up between you hips

Handfuls of sweat tangled hair, anytime, anywhere
I wanna lick you too much, baby
I just play all alone, whispering for your moan
Forced to crawl down this line, just to touch

I can get in
I can't get out
I can get in
I can't get out

I'm just sweating my sheets
I hate to see you leave but I love to watch you go, baby
Twisted secret lives, the way you bat your eyes
Givin' head, givin' head

Watch you come from above, I'm so needy for love, I'm desperate
Greedy in slavery
I sneak around from behind, I got a one track mind
We got a skin on skin thing, baby

I wanna lick you too much
I wanna lick you too much
I hear you comin' ooh aah, baby
I wanna lick you too much
I wanna lick you too much
I hear you comin' ooh aah
