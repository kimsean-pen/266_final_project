Never worry 'bout a single hatin motherfucker
Lookin' like my next supper, all these moves that I'm makin got people talkin'

Like how many papers is this man signin', I'm
back wit the backpack rap
Man, I'm thinkin that this shit finna make them scat, got a bag full of cash if we talkin' 'bout that
Run run it like Forrest Gump can you feel that, ay
I'm a renaissance man, if you wanna get a feat you not gon get response man
I be hotter than some shit your mom cook in a sauce pan don't be jealous don't be rude go back

To rollin' up grams, people think I'm sick as shit but I'm just eatin on ham
Wanna beat me in my game then bitch I'm settin' up camp
When the females hear my name I know they pussy all damp
Mr. Veterinarian I make that kitty go ham (damn)

Ballin' only seventeen my skin is green
Watching numbers goin' up that's just the everyday routine
All my old my friends hit me up they wish they had a time machine
Feelin' like I'm Cube I always hit 'em with no vaseline

Always sayin' no when you ask 'em if they got beef with me
DMs blowin' up I always say no bitch this dick ain't free
Watchin' on your every move I got that shit on DVD
Flexin' all the time but I just know that you a bourgeoisie

You got cash, buy sum chains, I buy houses ain't that strange
You ain't shit, I get lit, all you do is counterfeit
Little chick, but she thick, and she always on my drink
Shit I'm thirsty give it back, and she blondy just like Zac
("Who the fuck is that?" "High school musical")

Bitch hold my stacks I'm 30 minutes late to
France
Gotta get this cash, never give no chance, better bounce that ass, paid her an advance
Got me thru this day, sippin' on Bombay, I dont trust you gotta take this survey

Man I don't look back, never cut no slack,
Better get way back, fore yo ass get smacked, uhh
Memphis flow but I'm from Jakarta ho,
Never understood my hustle but I guess the more you know
Checkin' on your Instagram I see that shit is going slow,
Always hating on the progress man yo ass has gotta go

Ballin' only seventeen my skin is green
Watching numbers goin' up thats just the everyday routine
All my old my friends hit me up they wish they had a time machine
Feelin' like I'm Cube I always hit 'em with no vaseline

Always sayin' no when you ask em if they got beef with me
DMs blowin' up I always say no, bitch this dick ain't free
Watchin' on your every move I got that shit on DVD
Flexin' all the time but I just know that you a bourgeoisie
