Again the burden of losing rests upon my shoulders
And its weight seems unbearable
Your tomb is where your heart is, I should have told her
But within me hid a secret so terrible
To cry is to know that you're alive
But my river of tears has run dry
I never wanted to fool you, no
But a cold heart is a dead heart
And it feels like I've been buried alive by love
If I should die before I wake
Pray no one my soul to take
And if I wake before I die
Rescue me with your smile
If I should die before I wake
Pray no one my soul to take
And if I wake before I die
Rescue me with your smile (yeah)
The kiss of vanity blessed me with a spiritual murder
Fed the gods of war insatiable
Your home is where the dark is, I should have told her
Embraced the fire indestructible
To die is to know that you're alive
And my river of blood won't run dry
I never wanted to fool you, no
But a cold heart is a dead heart
And it feels like I've been buried alive by love
If I should die before I wake
Pray no one my soul to take
And if I wake before I die
Rescue me with your smile
If I should die before I wake
Pray no one my soul to take
And if I wake before I die
Rescue me with your smile
Oh, they say to cry is to know that you're alive
But my river of tears has run dry
I never wanted to fool you, no
But a cold heart is a dead heart
And a deserted soul is gone
A cold heart is a dead heart
And it feels like I've been buried alive by love
If I should die before I wake
Pray no one my soul to take
And if I wake before I die
Rescue me with your smile
If I should die before I wake
Pray no one my soul to take
And if I wake before I die
Rescue me with your smile
I've been buried alive by love (Buried alive by love)
I've been buried alive by love (Buried alive by love)
I've been buried alive by love (Buried alive by love)
I've been buried alive by love (Buried alive by love)
I've been buried alive by love (Buried alive by love)
I've been buried alive by love (Buried alive by love)
