Fear to walk down the aisle, feel the beat as you lead me on
From the sky to the mire, shame and pride are the seed of harm
Stand aside from the shadows, set your sight on the vein of life
Taste the blood of denial, blow the candle with rotten breath

I am waiting to face the hunter, to feast on my
Flesh, torn asunder

The sinner will die
Parading down through the misty light
He becomes the night
Upon the sacred and hallowed ground
Away from the sun, in holy halls within walls
Where the light won't reach down
You give your seed to the frail

Seek advice from the elder, falling down on your knees repent
Be the crow and the angel, be my curse to the end of time

Freedom lies in your own desires
Freedom lives in your will
Nothing's left as we're reaching higher
Lust is thicker than sin

The sacred leaves on the trees of hope
Malice poisons our souls
A Wicked halo deprived of love
Slithering to the cross

The sinner will die
Parading down through the misty light
He becomes the night
Upon the sacred and hallowed ground
Away from the sun, in holy halls within walls
Where the light won't reach down
You give your seed to the frail
