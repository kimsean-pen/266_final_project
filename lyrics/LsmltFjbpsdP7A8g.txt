I break down inside
Every time that I see you've arrived
Somehow you cross the line
Travelling faster than you've ever inclined
I've tried my best to look awaybut, I can't believe what
You tell me what I should see
Meanwhile, other screen, jealousy
Tellin' me to take a seat
And watch you as you take on it all

But you set to fail
No I've never been to Tokyo
Never made my innabitions known
Don't look kindly on the things you do
From my enigmatic point of view
No I've never been to Tokyo
Never made my innabitions known
Don't look kindly on the things you do
From my enigmatic point of view
