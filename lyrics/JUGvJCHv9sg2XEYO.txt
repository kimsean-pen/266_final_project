Living in a statistic
Sailboats floating on their flow chart
I don't wanna live like this
A day in the sun, swimming with sharks

There's no future, only money, money
No 'me and you', it's only money, money
Money buys a bright future
But we will be forever indentured — money, money
May we never get what we deserve — money, money

Head down, anonymous
The more you comply is the more you subsist

There's no scruples, only money, money
Dollars or rubles, it's all money, money
Money buys you clemency
In a clandestine economy — money, money
Bagged and price tagged, dangling off your feet

Living in a statistic
Sailboats floating on their sales graph
I don't wanna die like this
They wanna make waves, capsize the craft

Underneath the bathroom sink
In a wooden box with a broken lock
You can find my life savings
A high school ring and baseball cards
And when this horror's over
And the greenback's all but trashed
Currency will be our head and hands —
So, you don't want to lose your head

You can't afford to lose that

Don't sell yourself to me
You do it for the money
You sell the dream to me
You do it for the money
You're selling us your innocence
Don't sell your faith to me
You do it for the money
You're selling us your ignorance

Your money is counterfeit

May we never get what we deserve
Money, money
