Homegrown rock to the rhythm and bop to the beat of the radio
You ain't got the slang but you got the face to play the role

And don't you be so scared that you can't make a sound
Make a sound for me

All of London sing
'Cause England swing and they should love the tales I bring

You ain't got the slang but you got the face to play the role and
You can play with me

Pretty hairdos and those lipstick kisses blown yeah that's the right move
Make me feel like I'm the one who is moving you
The only one you see
All of London sing
'Cause England swing and they sure love the tales I bring
Those raining days they ain't so bad when you're the king
The king they want to be
