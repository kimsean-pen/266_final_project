People like you
You live in a dream world
You despise the outside and you fear the next one

It's in your dream
There's just one question
Should I kill
Or should I be left behind?
Sick and tired
Of all your complaints
This is the hour
We bring it down

I've come to realize
With every little glimpse you fade
I was told that I could fly
When least expected
Cloud connected

You seem to be
So introverted
How come we fail with all that is given

You crossed the line
You remember my name
Time runs backwards as we're heading that way

I've come to realize
With every little glimpse you fade
I was told that I could fly
When least expected
Cloud connected
(Cloud connected)

I've come to realize
With every little glimpse you fade
I was told that I could fly
When least expected
Cloud connected
