monday
sunshine
so high
it's hard to see
through the sunday clouds still lingering
how you wound up in the sea
spinning above
while burning inside
further you go and deeper you dive
don't mean to deceive
but it's they who believe
they fall in love with the girl they perceive not you
blind them with kindness
until they are reminding they're lonely and desperate
and you have a secret
it's something they all think they need
spinning above and burning inside
further you go and deeper you dive
don't mean to deceive
but it's they who believe
they fall in love with the girl they perceive not you
they see what they want in you they
get what they need from you
they take advantage of you
they would be nothing without you
