The flowers you gave me are rotting
And still I refuse to throw them away
Some of the bulbs never opened quite fully
They might, so I'm waiting and staying awake

Things I have loved I'm allowed to keep
I'll never know if I go to sleep

Eaaa, ahh
A-da-dum, a-da-dum
Bum, ba-da-dum
Waau, ba-daam

The papers around me are piling and twisting
Regina the paperback mummy, what then
I'm taking the knife to the books that I own
And I'm chopping and chopping and boiling soup from stone

Things I have loved I'm allowed to keep
I'll never know if I go to sleep
Things I have loved I'm allowed to keep
I'll never know if I go to sleep

Aah, ooh do doo
Aah, oh de dah, oh
Aah, de dah da da
Ba bum, ba bum
