Always thought impossible
Break the chains of life
What I fought for every day
Could finally come alive
Whatever dreams I longed for
I strove for to defend
Whatever hope that's there for me
Will stay there to the end

There's no trace of yesterday examining my faith
See a starlit hallway for the future I create
Before the darkness gets me I will spread my wings and fly
I transcend from the chaos and the darkness turns to light

This is the time
For chasing my desires
What's in my heart is true
And if my dreams set everything on fire
Then I would still belong to you

I never doubt the feelings that I had
Could bring me through
And every teardrop leaving me
Was leaving me for you

If all my instincts screamed to me
And tried to guide me through
Would I long for an eternity
Or just come back to you

This is the time
For chasing my desires
What's in my heart is true
And if my dreams set everything on fire
Then I would still belong to you

What I can dream
Scream
It's possible
But it will turn
Burn
Keep it real
Trust your dreams
And soon you'll stand next to me

This is the time
For chasing my desires
What's in my heart is true
And if my dreams set everything on fire
Then I would still belong to you

This is the time
For chasing my desires
What's in my heart is true
And if my dreams set everything on fire
Then I would still belong to you
