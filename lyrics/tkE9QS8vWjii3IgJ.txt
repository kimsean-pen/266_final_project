Riding the underground
Swimming in sweat
A rumble above and below
Hey cop don't you know
The heat's on all right
The hot summer day didn't quit for the night

1277 express to heaven
Speeding along like dynamite
1277 express to heaven
Rumbles the steel like a dogfight
You caught me in a spell
Trying to leave but you know darn well
The heat from below can burn your eyes out

Blackened out eyes
Scratched on the wall
Stoned out looks from the crowd
The king will not know
On the wall it was said
The flash of his cards was sprayed with red

1277 express to heaven
Speeding along like dynamite
1277 express to heaven
Rumbles the steel like a dog fight
You caught me in a spell
Trying to leave but you know darn well
The heat from below can burn your eyes out

1277 express to...
1277 express to...
1277 express to heaven
Speeding along like dynamite
1277 express to heaven
Rumbles the steel like a dogfight
You caught me in a spell
Trying to leave but you know darn well
The heat from below can burn, Yeah burn!
Your eyes out
Your eyes out

Your eyes out!
out! out! out! out!
out! out! out! out!
