Someone said they saw you
In the night and on your own
There's beauty in the lonely
You're the moonlight in this town

Seems like every moment
Is another from before
Your eyes have nothing behind them
Your arms and legs are sore

Neighbour
You've fallen in with the wrong crowd
I've got so much to tell you
In so little time
Oh, neighbour
Keep things close to your heart
If no one can help you
Then how can I?

Someone said they saw you
Said they saw it as a sign
Well, every single second
Catches up the next in line

Neighbour
You've fallen in with the wrong crowd
I've got so much to tell you
In so little time
Oh, neighbour
Keep things close to your heart
If no one can help you
Then how can I?

Neighbour

Keep things close to your heart

Someone said they saw you
Someone said they saw you
Someone said they saw you
Someone said they saw you
