The virtual is going in the way
Keep it tight so no one will stray
Staring at a light needless to say
That I'll be alright, alright, oh

And your tears sting, friend
You have waited the end out there
Golden hour finding
You stand still, stare
At my stupid bedroom

All that I wanted wasn't unwanted
Oh, and I wonder why I'm not wanted
All that I wanted was not there
But I dared
Be wanted

Yeah, in a corridor
Yeah, and you call me
Yeah, when I see you
You, you know damn well

Throw back arms I love you
And I won't be bothering with mourning
It's crucial that you see the truth
When looking for yourself
Not useless observations
Hey

Yeah, in a corridor
Yeah, and you call me
Yeah, when I see you
You, you know damn well
