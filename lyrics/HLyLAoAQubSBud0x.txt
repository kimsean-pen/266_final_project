All of my friends, a plastic bag
Walking around, jumping the train tracks
It's over the fence, veins all black
Sleep on the bench in the park on my birthday
Caught the blue lights
Cursed your name
When I find I'm still awake

Give me everything good
I'll throw it away
I wish I could quit but I can't stand the shakes
Choking smoke, singing your praise
But I think there's a god and he hears either way
I rejoice, and complain
I never know what to say

But I think there's a god and he hears either way
And I rejoice, and complain
Lift my voice, that I was made
Somebody's listening at night
The ghosts of my price when I pray
Asking why did you let them leave
And then make me stay
Know my name and all of my hideous mistakes
I rejoice, I rejoice
I rejoice, I rejoice
