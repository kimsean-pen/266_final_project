I see the waves of sand
Big free, another land
Dreams within dreams, you are alive
They gave me their wings, I spread them wide

I'll move on to another place
From my memories unmade
I'll hold on and my heart will find you there
Love will shine free forever

Sun flames and moons glow
Timeless the tides will flow
What will I face? What will be mine?
Fortune and fate, the other side

I'll move on to another place
From my memories unmade
I'll hold on and my heart will find you there
Love will shine free forever
