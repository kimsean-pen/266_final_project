It's KKB, let's go!
走って登って撃って跳んで
Tomb Raider になりたいんだ
かっこ良くて強くて
憧れなんだ Tomb Raider
Windows 98, remember those days?
夢中になって遊んだ every day
誰にも負けない諦めない
自分に誓ったあのころ never fades
Time warp! I'm 22 years old
大人の世界に change over
秘境で嘘つき駆け引き for money
Hard to keep up always stopping me but
忘れない逃げない絶対
あのころ自分 突き通せ
あの心 あのハート
One, two, three
進んで to the next level!

Whichever console you play
No matter how many hours a day
I could win at any game
Whether your a boy or a girl or a super computer
It's often said
I should get some girly hobbies instead
But that thought fills me with dread
I'm not into sewing, baking, dress-making

Not eating, bitching, submitting

同じ色に染まらず
自分の道を歩むって
寂しいし 辛いし
いろんなこと言われるけど
出る釘は打たれるって

よく聞くよね この言葉

それならいっぱい打てばいい
I did it my way この人生

Whichever console you play
No matter how many hours a day
I could win at any game
Whether your a boy or a girl or a super computer
It's often said
I should get some girly hobbies instead
But that thought fills me with dread
I'm not into sewing, baking, dress-making
