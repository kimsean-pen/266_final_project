I've always been a fan of the night life, cause it's the only life I had.
Expressing my mind with paper and a pen playing my guitar till my fingers bled on the carpet
Maybe I wasn't like all the normal kids. I was born just a little bit different.
I tried to fit in I got sick of it

You say I'm just a loser in the background. I can never seem to get it right
But I'm learning my worth is more than your word.
You told me I would back out, I would break down, I'm not even putting up a fight.
But I'm learning my worth is more than your word.

It wasn't easy being rejected by the thing I wanted so bad.
To be excepted, to be wanted, to wake up and say this is gonna be a good day.
