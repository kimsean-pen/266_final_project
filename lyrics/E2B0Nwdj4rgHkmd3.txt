You
You

Tell me how,
Has it taken so long for me to open up my eyes

I see through you now
I won't fall for the things you said before

How
Has it taken so long for me to finally realize

I'm on my team
I won't run away but back t-to believe

And when they all turn against you
You better be prepared to fight

They say I'm a sinner, but nobody knows
You only do what you're told, you better hope that you're right
They say I'm a sinner, I'm not the only one
You wanna point your finger, you better make a choice tonight
'cause I'll stand up for what is right

How
Has such a bitter person become a man I am

I'm turning my heart out
Just give me the time

Tell me how
How am I to change when I'm still trying to figure out how
(How to save my life)
How to be saved
(Save my, save me, save me)

And when they all turn against you
Try not to look the other way

They say I'm a sinner, but nobody knows
You only do what you're told, you better hope that you're right
They say I'm a sinner, I'm not the only one
You wanna point your finger, you better make a choice tonight
'cause I'll stand up for what is right

You, you better choose your side
Make a choice tonight
No, you better draw the line right now
Between wrong and right

I am a sinner
I'll never be a martyr
Just stand up for what's right

They say I'm a sinner, but nobody knows
You only do what you're told, you better hope that you're right
They say I'm a sinner, I'm not the only one
You wanna point your finger, you better make a choice tonight
'cause I'll stand up for what is right

All my life I've been the person I am
Who are you to try and judge
