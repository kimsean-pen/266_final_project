I turn into show
The air is loud
It's crowded
Everyones there
You think I want them
I don't want them, I don't care
They're wondering what they could've made of me
They think if I get to the ballroom in time
If I cross the finish line

There's all the people in the room
And I just wanna be alone
All these people in the room
I just wanna be alone with you

Out on dance floor
It's a simple feeling
You're a simple man
I'm gonna let you round here
Tryna make you understand
And to all the creatures in the night
I know somethings arise, going to cause
All our stars are born to die
I'm not gonna die tonight

There's all the people in the room
And I just wanna be alone
All these people in the room
I just wanna be alone with you

I should've told you
There is no where to go from here
I should've told you
There is nowhere to go from here

(I see you dancing to me
I see you dancing to me now)

Don't you waste it, dance a little closer
Put your fear in the pocket, give it up a little more
Don't you waste it, dance a little closer
Put your fear in your pocket

All the people in the room
And I just wanna be alone
All these people in the room
I just wanna be alone with you

I should've told you
There is no where to go from here
I should've told you
There is nowhere to go from here
(I just wanna be alone)
