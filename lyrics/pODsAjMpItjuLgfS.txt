It's always the same
You're more fickle than the weather
First, it's "Babe, I need my space"
And then it's "Wait, let's stay together"
You declare a thumb war
Drag me to the dance floor
Any excuse to touch me
This feels like a rerun
Let me guess, when we're done
I'm the one left wondering

If my heart is broken
Wouldn't it stop working?
Shouldn't it stop hurting?
Oh baby, I'm just smirking through the pain
If my heart is broken
Couldn't it stop jerking me around?
I wanna know—can this last forever?

Night after night, our hearts
Are beating out of rhythm
Would that I could
I'd speak the spell
But it's no good
If you won't listen
There isn't a dive bar
That isn't on your radar
We both know you'll find me
Is this mirror broken?
After all is spoken
It makes us feel so ugly

If my heart is broken
Wouldn't it stop working?
Shouldn't it stop hurting?
Oh baby, I'm just smirking through the pain
If my heart is broken
Couldn't it stop jerking me around?

You oughta know—I surrender
You oughta know—I surrender
You oughta know—I surrender
You oughta know—I surrender

If my heart is broken
Wouldn't it stop working?
Shouldn't it stop hurting?
Oh baby, I'm just smirking through the pain
If my heart is broken
Couldn't it stop jerking me around?
I wanna know—can this last forever?
