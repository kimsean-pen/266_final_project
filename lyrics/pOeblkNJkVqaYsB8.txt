Black line run
Against the center of another dying sun
A situation where the lie's behind the truth
Come together and deny the fucking proof

I'm ready to surrender
(Surrender)
Surrender
(Surrender)

Remember
(Remember)
Forever is over now

If I can't stop you
I'll never get to start again
If I don't watch you
I'll never see the bitter end

Oh, nail my soul
To the middle of a cross that fills this hole
I never understood the Written Word
Don't forget that I'm not aware of what you heard

I'm ready to surrender
(Surrender)
Surrender
(Surrender)

Remember
(Remember)
Forever is over now

If I can't stop you
I'll never get to start again
If I don't watch you
I'll never see the bitter end

Hold it high
Show the sky your destiny
Close your eyes
And burn away your hate

Hold it high
We can feel our prayers as we
Close our eyes
We can take the world away

Forever is over now
Forever is over now
Forever is over now
(Forever is over now)
(Forever is over now)
(Forever is over now)

If I can't stop you
I'll never get to start again
If I don't watch you
I'll never see the bitter end

Hold it high
Show the sky your destiny
Close your eyes
And burn away your hate

Hold it high
We can feel our prayers as we
Close our eyes
We can take the world
Take the world away
