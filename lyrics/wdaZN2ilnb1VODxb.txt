So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much far from the heart
Forever trusting in who we are
And nothing else matters
Never open my self this way
Life is ours we live it our way
Whole these words i don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters
Never careful what they do
Never careful what they know
But I know
So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much far from the heart
Forever trusting in who we are
And nothing else matters
Never careful what they do
Never careful what they know
But I know
I never open my self this way
Life is ours we live it our way
Whole these words i don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters
Never careful what they say
Never careful gives the play
Never careful what they do
Never careful what they know
And I know ...
