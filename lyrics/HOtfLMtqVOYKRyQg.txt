Flying high like the birds and the bees,
And we'll fill the sky with these songs in the trees,
Cause we're buzzin', buzzin,
And we're hummin', hummin'
And we're lovin', lovin' all day-ay-ay-ay
Flying high like the birds and the bees,
And we'll feel alive while we float with the breeze,
Cause we're buzzin', buzzin'
And we're hummin', hummin'
And we're lovin', lovin' all day-ay-ay-ay
Feels good when I'm near you
I got the whole world in our rearview,
But when you're here I can feel you,
Like a summer day in June
Migrate from the bad times now
Love crimes never held me down
Weaving through all these grapevines
How we gonna find our truth
Flying high like the birds and the bees,
And we'll fill the sky with these songs in the trees,
Cause we're buzzin', buzzin',
And we're hummin', hummin'
And we're lovin', lovin', all day-ay-ay-ay
Flying high like the birds and the bees,
And we'll feel alive while we float with the breeze,
Cause we're buzzin', buzzin',
And we're hummin', hummin'
And we're lovin', lovin' all day-ay-ay-ay
Find your wings when you're with me, girl
Take a trip we could feel this world
Leave it all watch your life uncurl
Let these moments move
Love deeper than the blue that you see now
Way above all the seas with our wings out
Good times yeah we got 'em on speed dial
Sun shinin' through
Flying high like the birds and the bees,
And we'll fill the sky with these songs in the trees,
Cause we're buzzin', buzzin,
And we're hummin', hummin'
And we're lovin', lovin' all day-ay-ay-ay
Flying high like the birds and the bees,
And we'll feel alive while we float with the breeze,
Cause we're buzzin', buzzin'
And we're hummin', hummin'
And we're lovin', lovin' all day-ay-ay-ay
Flying high like the birds and the bees,
And we'll fill the sky with these songs in the trees,
Cause we're buzzin', buzzin,
And we're hummin', hummin'
And we're lovin', lovin' all day-ay-ay-ay
Flying high like the birds and the bees,
And we'll feel alive while we float with the breeze,
Cause we're buzzin', buzzin'
And we're hummin', hummin'
And we're lovin', lovin' all day-ay-ay-ay
