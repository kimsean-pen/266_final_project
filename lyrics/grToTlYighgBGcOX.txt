He's so the purity, a shaving in the morning,
And standing all pigeon-toed, in his disarray

Straighten the picture pose,
He's coming around to meet you

And screaming like a battle cry, "it's more if I stay"

Me and you cold, drivin' in the snow,
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Cowgirl king of the rodeo, let the good times roll,
Let the good times roll

How dare you come to me like Withnail for a favor,
Ah hold on, not my fairy tale you're trying to start
Take off your overcoat, you're stayin' for the weekend,
And swayin' like a smoky grey, a drink in the park

Me and you cold, drivin' in the snow,
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Cowgirl king of the rodeo, let the good times roll,
Let the good times roll

Good time to roll on
