One breath away from Mother Oceania,
Your nimble feet make prints in my sands.
You have done good for yourselves
Since you left my wet embrace,
And crawled ashore.
Every boy, is a snake is a lily,
Every pearl is a lynx, is a girl.
Sweet like harmony made into flesh.
You dance by my side,
Children sublime.
You show me continents,
I see the islands.
You count the centuries,
I blink my eyes.
Hawks and sparrows race in my waters,
Stingrays are floating
Across the sky.
Little ones, my sons and my daughters,
Your sweat is salty,
I am why,
I am why,
I am why.
Your sweat is salty,
I am why,
I am why,
I am why.
