We can live wild
Climb the trees and leave the roots behind
Here in my eyes
Chase your soul and see inside your mind
Eons ago
Footprints from that person I use to know

Woowooohooohooo
Lost in the chase
Woowooohooohooo
Tender green life

If I
Lead
Hide
And Seek
Tender Green Life

Bodies collide
Drift into the shadows of the night
Tip of the ride
Making madness freckles in the sky
Flickering heights
Come and find your heart inside the mind
