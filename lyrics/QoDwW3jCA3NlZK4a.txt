Dear pain, oh, it's been a long time
Remember when you were holding me tight
I would stay awake with you all night

Dear shame, I was safe in your arms
You were there when it all fell apart
I would get so lost in your beautiful lies

I let you go but you're still chasing

Go ahead, you're never going to take me
You can bend, but you're never going to break me
I was yours, I'm not yours anymore
You don't own me

Dear hate, I know you're not far
You would wait at the door of my heart
I was amazed at the passion in your cries

Dear anger, you made me so high
You were faithful to show up on time
Such a flame that was burning in your eyes

I let you go, but you're still chasing

Go ahead, you're never going to take me
You can bend, but you're never going to break me
I was yours, I'm not yours anymore
You don't own me

Go ahead, put a target on my forehead
You can fire, but you've got no bullet
I was yours, I'm not yours anymore
You don't own me

You tempted me to look back
But everything that we had together was a lie

Go ahead, you're never going to take me
You can bend, but you're never going to break me
I was yours, I'm not yours anymore
You don't own me

Go ahead, put a target on my forehead
You can fire, but you've got no bullet
I was yours, I'm not yours anymore
You don't own me

Go ahead, put a target on my forehead
You can fire, but you've got no bullet
I was yours, I'm not yours anymore
You don't own me
