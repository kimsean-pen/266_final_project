So now we have gathered, with mead in our veins
We drink and we gamble, we're screaming your names
Filling our horns for the gods and their reign
We're warriors of Valhalla, we'll rise again
The tavern is shaking, the barrels are drained
We're Brothers of metal
We're fucking, we're fighting, we bleed
And we're never gonna fail before the sons of Odin

All hail gods of war
War
All hail gods of war
Hail my brother
All hail gods of war
War
All hail gods of war
Brothers of metal

As brothers arrive they are joining the feast
All brought from the battle by the Valkyries
And Saerimnir feeds every man, every beast
In life we would suffer, but here we are pleased
So drink brother, drink for the living deceased
We're brothers of metal
We're fucking, we're fighting, we bleed
And we're never gonna fail before the sons of Odin

All hail gods of war
War
All hail gods of war
Hail my brother
All hail gods of war
War
All hail gods of war
Brothers of metal

All hail gods of war
War
All hail gods of war
Hail my brother
All hail gods of war
War
All hail gods of war
Brothers of metal

All hail gods of war
War
All hail gods of war
Hail my brother
All hail gods of war
War
All hail gods of war
Brothers of metal
