Black magic has risen in Witchwood
Their devilry takes place within our lonely woods
Such strange words & stranger visions
Forbidden hymns to summon things one never should

Our children leave to hear their song
Rituals to which they now belong
Black magic rites

Black magic, so long forgotten
What mysteries lay hidden in the piper's song?
Ancient world, ever-nearing
It's much too late, there's no escape; we're far too gone

A woman stood at Witchwood Cross
And spoke to me, although a stranger
Of eldritch worlds once thought lost
And blasphemies that once were whispered
She said: you'll welcome us into your homes
We'll linger in your blood
Our ways are in your bones

From the Witchwood we rise and greet you at your door
The old ways remain and the ancient gods they live on
