Say, say, say
What you want
But don't play games
With my affection
Take, take, take
What you need
But don't leave me
With no direction

All alone
I sit home by the phone
Waiting for you, Baby
Through the years
How can you stand to hear
My pleading for you dear?
You know I'm crying
O-o-o-o-oh
Ye-Yeah!

Go, go, go
Where you want
But don't leave me
Here forever
You, you, you
Stay away
So long, girl
I see you never

What can I do
Girl to get through to you?
'Cause I love you, Baby
Standing here
Baptisted in all my tears
Baby, through the years
You know I'm crying
O-o-o-o-oh

You never ever worry
And you never shed a tear
You saying that my love ain't real
Just look at my face these tears ain't drying

You, you, you
Can never say
That I'm not the one
Who really loves you
I pray, pray, pray
Fvery day
That you'll see things
Girl like I do

What can I do
Girl to get through to you?
'Cause I love you, Baby
Standing here
Baptisted in all my tears
Baby, through the years
You know I'm crying
O-o-o-o-oh
