Got a one, two, three, four, five
Right now
The kind of feeling come alive
Right now

If you get in my way
Don't you get in my way
If you get in my
If you get in my

I got a one, two, three, four, five
Right now
Hope to God that I don't die
Right now

If you get in my way
Please don't get in my way
If you get in my
If you get in my

I got a one, two, three, four
Right now

If you get in my way
Don't you get in my way
If you get in mine
If you get in mine

I got a one, two, three, four
Right now
Right now
Right now

Right now
Right now
Right now
Right now
