You're a no good heartbreaker
You're a liar and you're a cheat
I don't know why i let you do these thing to me
My friends keep telling me that you ain't no good
They don't know that i would leave you if i could
I guess i'm on tight
And i'm stuck like glue
Cause i ain't never
I ain't never
I ain't never... no... no...
Loved a girl the way that i
I love you
Sometimes i know i thought
You would run out of fools
But i was so wrong
You got one that you'll never lose
The way you treat me is shame
How could you hurt me so bad
Baby you know that i'm the best thing that you ever had
Kiss me once again
Don't you never never say that we're through
Cause i ain't never
Never
Never no no
Loved a girl the way that i
I love you
I can't sleep at night i can't eat a bite
I guess i'll never be free
Since you got your hooks in me
I ain't never loved a girl
I ain't never loved a girl
Ain't never loved a girl that hurt me so bad
What am i gonna do about it
I tell you i'm gonna hold on to her
I'm gonna hold on to her
