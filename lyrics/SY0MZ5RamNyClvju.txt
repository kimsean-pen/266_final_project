Sometimes I lose my way
I forget the words to say
Been having trouble with myself
Yes, I am in pretty bad health
That don't bother me
I'll tell you, that's a fact
It's easy to keep track
Now that I've been there and back

Some people try to make a deal
They wanna tell me how to feel
They wanna take a peace of mind
So they can say they had a piece of mine
They must think I'm asleep
But I ain't takin' a nap
It's easy to keep track
Now that I've been there and back

Doing weird things with my time
Far away from my peace of mind
Taking things that are not mine
I gotta clear my honky-tonk mind
I'm out in the street
I gotta get right back
It's easy to keep track
Now that I've been there and back
Now that I've been there and back
Now that I've been there and back
