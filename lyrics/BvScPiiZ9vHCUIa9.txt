Boom, clap! Clap!

I'm feeling such a vacancy, I don't feel whole (oh oh)
Wish I could put my finger on it but I don't know what it is
I looked in every place I could seek
Tried to find the missing part of me
I can't explain this feeling (feeling)

Feels like I'm on the wrong journey going in circles
And I ain't even going nowhere
I'm lost in the middle of nowhere
Something is missing
(Can't somebody help me?)
Something is missing
(I'm missing a part of me)
Something is missing
(Show me what it is)
Show me what's missing
(Missing)

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Boom, clap! Clap!

I'm in the dark room in a bad position
I'm looking for the light to restore my vision (vision)
'Cause I'm walking blind, I keep falling down, I can't find my way
I can't explain this feeling

Feels like I'm on the wrong journey going in circles
And I ain't even going nowhere
I'm lost in the middle of nowhere
Something is missing
(Can't somebody help me?)
Something is missing
(I'm missing a part of me)
Something is missing
(Show me what it is)
Show me what's missing
(Missing)

Feels like I'm leaving something behind
Can't think straight, something's on my mind
Can't pretend to 'cause I'm all so broke
Can't find the words 'cause they've all been spoke
The answer's gonna be right in my face, oh oh
What I'm gonna do to fill this empty space, oh oh

Feels like I'm on the wrong journey going in circles
And I ain't even going nowhere
I'm lost in the middle of nowhere
Something is missing
(Can't somebody help me?)
Something is missing
(I'm missing a part of me. Something is missing)
Show me what it is

Feels like I'm on the wrong journey going in circles
And I ain't even going nowhere
I'm lost in the middle of nowhere
Something is missing
(Can't somebody help me?)
Something is missing
(I'm missing a part of me)
Something is missing
(Show me what it is)
Show me what's missing
(Missing)
