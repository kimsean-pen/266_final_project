first i stand then i die
i became all mankind
as i drip from mine eyes
i washed away to a smaller size
we'll wait 1000 years until the end of time
we'll wait 1000 more dressed up in gold and white
we'll climb the mountain sides to find what's in the sky
we'll dig through mountain sides to find what's deep inside
if we see what we need we'll find
it don't make who we be
if we try would we find
that what we need is more than time
we'll wait 1000 years until the end of time
we'll wait 1000 more dressed up in gold and white
we'll climb the mountain sides to find what's in the sky
we'll dig through mountain sides to find what's deep inside
i've got everything you need
the friends you help need everything
what you need, what you need
you can help out all your friends in need
but the friends you help need everything
what you need, what you need
first you stand then you crawl
then you sleep to be reborn
we'll wait 1000 years until the end of time
we'll wait 1000 more dressed up in gold and white
we'll climb the mountain sides to find what's in the sky
we'll dig through mountain sides to find what's deep inside
you can help out all your friends in need
but the friends you help need everything
what you need, what you need
i've got everything you need
the friends you help need everything
what you need, what you need
