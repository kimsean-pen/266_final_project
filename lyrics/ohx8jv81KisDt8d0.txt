There was a time when I would have followed you
To the end of the earth
I was willing to share it all with you
The love, the hurt
I've seen you when your dreams were falling in the dust
But I never stopped believing in you
I always thought our love was strong enough
One you could hold on to

You never see it coming
You just let it fly
On silent wings, silent wings
You can't hide what you feel inside
And the fire has left your eyes
On silent wings
I see us in our dreams and we're dancing

I can almost hear the song
But the prayers, they go unanswered
But we both know, we're just hanging on
I feel ashamed, but I'll never know the reason why
The rug was pulled so gently from under my feet
I only know that something good has died
Between you and me, oh it's just a memory
You never see it coming

You just go separate ways

On silent wings, silent wings
There's no more promises to break
Or our love has slipped away
On silent wings
You never see it coming
But you know it has to end
On silent wings, silent wings
I will never be the same again
I feel the whisper of the wind
On silent wings
