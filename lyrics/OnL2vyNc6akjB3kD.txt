We still live in the same town, well don't we?
But I don't see you around anymore
I go to all the same places, not even a trace of you
Your days are numbered at 24

And I'm getting bored waiting round for you
Were not getting any younger, and I
Won't look back cause there's no use
It's time to move forward

I feel no sympathy, you live inside a cave!
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time for feeling sorry

But I try and not to think of what might happen
When your reality, it finally cuts through
Well as for me, I got out and I'm on the road
The worst part is that this, this could be you

And you know it too, you can't run from your shame
You're not getting any younger, time
It's passing by, but you waited awake
It's time to roll over!

I feel no sympathy, you live inside a cave!
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time for feeling sorry

And all the best lies
They are told with fingers tied
So cross them tight
Won't you promise me tonight
If It's the last thing you do, you'll get out

I feel no sympathy, you live inside a cave!
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time
I've got no time

I feel no sympathy, you live inside a cave!
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time

I've got no time for feeling sorry
I've got no time for feeling sorry
