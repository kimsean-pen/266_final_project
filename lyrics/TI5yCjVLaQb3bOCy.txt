Out at the trains tracks
I dream to escape
But a song comes to my iPod
And I realize it's getting late
I can't take the staring
And the sympathy
And I don't like the questions
"How do you feel?
How's it going in school?
We know you want to talk about it."

(Way out, way out of here
Fade out, wait up ahead)

And I'm trying to forget you
And I know that I will
In a thounsand years
Or maybe a week
Burn all you pictures
Cut out your face
The shutters are down
And the courtains are closed
And I've covered my tracks
Disposed of the car
And I'm trying to forget
Even your name
And the way that you look
When your sleeping, dreaming of this

Way out, way out of here
Fade out, wait up ahead
Way out, way out of here
Fade out, wait up ahead
