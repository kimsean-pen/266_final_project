You may be broke now and you may be bored
Call you delinquent or leave you ignored
You'll get what you want
Drive to distraction and crash on the way
Watch your reaction and wait 'til you say
you'll get what you want
It hurts if you can't

Young offender
what's your defence?
You're younger than me, obviously
Young offender
why the pretence?
You don't agree, I know, I know

I'll do what you want if you want me enough
I'll put down my book and start falling in love
or isn't that done?
How graceful your movements, how bitter your scorn
I've been a teenager since before you were born
and I'm younger than some
I've only begun

Young offender
what's your defence?
You're younger than me, obviously

Will I get in your way
or open your eyes?
Who will give whom
the bigger surprise?

Is that fire in your eyes or the glow of machines?
Watch how your fingers burn over the keys
so sure what you do
I haven't a clue

Young offender
what's your defence?
You're younger than me, obviously
Young offenderhow you resent
the lovers you need
It hurts when they bleed
Young offender
why the pretence?
You don't agree, I know, I know
Young offender, why the pretense?
You don't agree, I know, I know
