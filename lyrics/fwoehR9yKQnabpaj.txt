You found me lost
Left me like a desert rain
I tried to fight
But I just don't feel the same
I feel possessed
I speak but can't express
I lay in bed
Replaying life we once lived

Dime dónde voy
Dime dónde fui
I'm going back and forth
Like branches in the breeze
Dime dónde voy
Dime dónde fui
I don't know how to tell you
Tell you

I feel like I'm the outside looking in
When I'm with him
I don't know how to love now, I pretend
When I'm with him

Querías más de lo que podría ser
Me alejo más y tú no lo puedes ver
I feel possessed
I can't help but repress
All of the signs
Telling me that I'm not fine

Dime dónde voy
Dime dónde fui
I'm driving myself crazy sitting silently
Dime dónde voy
Dime dónde fui
I don't know how to tell you
Tell you

I feel like I'm the outside looking in
When I'm with him
I don't know how to love now, I pretend
When I'm with him

I'm sleepwalking every time
Trying but don't know why
On the outside looking in
When I'm with him

I'm playing a part
But it's getting too hard
Awake in the dark
It's too late to tell you
Tell you

I feel like I'm the outside looking in
When I'm with him
I don't know how to love now, I pretend
When I'm with him

I feel like I'm the outside looking in
When I'm with him
Oh, I on the outside looking in
When I'm with him
