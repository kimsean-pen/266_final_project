I will bid farewell, sever the ties
Is this what I am?
Is this all that's left?
Turn from deceit
The love of self is death
Deliverance is given to you
To you

I will bid farewell, sever the ties
Sever the ties

Now your heart beats back with deception
You have been forsaken
Leave behind (I will) all reminders of you
Of you

I will bid farewell to all lies
I will bid farewell, sever the ties

Sever!
Searching, always searching
Hoping for a change

I will never be satisfied
I will never be
(I will) I will never (never) be satisfied
I will now bid farewell

I will bid farewell to all lies
I will bid (I will bid) farewell, sever the ties
