You know I can be found
Sitting home all alone
If you can't come around
At least please telephone
Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true

Baby, if I made you mad
For somethin' I might have said
Please, let's forget my past
The future looks bright ahead
Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby it's just you I'm thinkin' of

Lets walk up to the preacher
And let us say I do
Then you'll know you'll have me
And I'll know that I'll have you
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby it's just you
I'm thinkin' of

Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby it's just you I'm thinkin' of
