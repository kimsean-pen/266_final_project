I'm sorry, I'm really a mess right now
I'm trying my best to get it together somehow
I can't see this way, locked up in this pain that you left me
I'm unraveling, looking for things that'll never be

Stars fade away, they just crash into space
Disappear from the light like you and I

Tell me, where love goes when it's gone?
Tell me, where hearts go when they go wrong?
Suddenly someone is no one, I've come undone
Undone, undone, undone, undone, undone

I'm sorry I let me fall for you
I can erase you and forget you
But I can't undo you
You're the hand I can't hold
The words I'm not told when I'm lonely
And I don't want you back
I just want to have what you took from me

Stars fade away, they just crash into space
Disappear from the light like you and I

Tell me, where love goes when it's gone?
Tell me, where hearts go when they go wrong?
Suddenly someone is no one, I've come undone
Undone, undone

I'll come around again,
I know it's not the end
But right now, I've got nowhere to begin
to begin

Tell me, where love goes when it's gone?
Tell me, where hearts go when they go wrong?
Suddenly someone is no one, I've come undone
Undone, undone

Nothing but emptiness inside
Love leaves a black hole where it dies
How can I ever love again? I've come undone
Undone, undone, undone, undone
Undone, undone, undone
