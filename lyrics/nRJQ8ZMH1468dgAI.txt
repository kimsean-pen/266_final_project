How long can i miss you I want you to know
The seconds you leave me are ticking so slow
I give up

I know that i need it when I've had enough
Like falling to pieces and picking them up
Let me go

Holding back the tears from falling
That's what I do
Holding back the tears so long
When you come back again
We can convene make it forever

Holding back the tears from falling
That's what I do
Holding back the tears so long
When you come back again
We can convene make it forever

Holding back the tears from falling
