Here in America
Respect your fellow man
Some foreign cultures
Don't understand
We got this little rule
And it's called elbowroom
Pertaining to the special occupancy
You consume
If I'm in front of line
Then you should stay behind
Until I get my iceless soda.
It's such a simple thing
It's called first come first serve
Wooden clogs that smash my feet
I really don't deserve
In every region
It seems there's a legion
Of impatient close talking slime
That cut in line.
Barge me with your walkin'
Spray me with your talkin'
I am the ambassador
I'll kick your assador

What's your affinity
for my vicinity?
There's plenty room here
In your country
It's just good etiquette
To use deodorant
Maybe smelling bad's
The way you choose to represent
Boozy and stinkin'
I smell what your thinkin'
I just need a little more space
Get out my face
Barge me with your walkin'
Spray me with your talkin'
Back the fuck up ass hole
Shut your bread & cheese hole
Tryin' to make myself clear
Give me just a foot here
You offend my sinus
I'll kick your royal highness
I'll see your euro-barge by friend
And raise you one ugly American

In every region
It seems there's a legion
Of impatient close talking slime
That cut in line.
Barge me with your walkin'
Spray me with your talkin'
Push you out of the way
Sock you in the pate'
Step right off you inbred
Hygiene like a deadhead
I am the ambassador
of fuckin' kick your assador
SMELL!
