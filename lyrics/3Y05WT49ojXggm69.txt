Still the legend goes on and on...

I cast a spell
And I've seen
Pieces of the future
Unveiled

Green are the valleys
Where I belong
I've seen the mountain still shining

People are dreaming
Singing a song
The Ghost of War
Has disappeared

There were eagles flying
In the sky
Over fields of gold
The kingdom of the magic

Reaching for the land
For the dream
Stories still untold
Still the legend goes on and on

I've seen...

This night will soon be gone
Here comes the dawn
My contract will be up
I'll be free

No more revenge
Or darkness to heal
The orchards will all be in blossom

Love of my life
Is healthy and real
The Ghost of War
Has disappeared

There were eagles flying
In the sky
Over fields of gold
The kingdom of the magic

Reaching for the land
For the dream
Stories still untold
Still the legend goes on and on

I've seen...

There were eagles flying
In the sky
Over fields of gold
The kingdom of the magic

Reaching for the land
For the dream
Stories still untold
Still, the legend goes on and on

I've seen...
Finally I have seen...
