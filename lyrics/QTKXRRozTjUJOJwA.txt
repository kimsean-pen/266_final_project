Did you escape from the feelings that you wanted to replace
With anything you thought could fill the space?
I hope you found the quietness you want
Because nothing good comes from being gone
So keep your eyes on anything,
As long as it makes you happy
Do you feel like a big girl?
Do you feel like a big girl now?
Now that you're out in the big world
And I still can't leave the house
'Cause the starting line is atop a mountain
That I can't climb with these broken arms
I liked you, but more than anything, I wanted to be like you
With the strength inside to make it to the top
'Cause nothing good comes from being gone
I'm willing to admit it's all my fault
I will trade all of my pride for what I've lost
I don't want to lose this battle with my thoughts
Nothing good comes from being gone
Nothing good comes from being gone
Nothing good comes from being gone
