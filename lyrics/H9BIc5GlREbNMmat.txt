You said that you wanted everything
We saw in the movies
We saw on the tv screen
But i can't get out of bed
So tell me why life is so misleading
And why i feel like i'm bleeding
Through a hole in my head

You said that you wanted everything
We saw in the movies
We saw on the tv screen
But it's happening again
And i know i promised that
I wouldn't let it get this bad
But i'm doing everything i can

I know that you wanted everything
But the second i start to leave
It all feels like an action scene
