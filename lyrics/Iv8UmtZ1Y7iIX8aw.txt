Up up up and down
Turn turn turnaround
Round round roundabout
And over again
Gun gun son of a gun
You are the only one
That makes any difference
What i say
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away
Up up up and down
Turn turn turnaround
Round round roundabout
And over again
Gun gun son of a gun
You are the only one
That makes any difference
What i say
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away
