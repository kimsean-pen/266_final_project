Snow beat down in the shadows
No sunlight ever shines
Dark skid marks plug the mud
On the leafy incline

No voice to speak about
No movement in the trees
No lovers struggle for release
On the fallen autumn leaves

I've gotta know I'm not alone
Just one soul
I've gotta know I'm not alone
Just one soul

Small cabbage grows in bunches
And fungus wood has bones
Dark water rain goes through
All pathways fill with stones

No voice to speak about
No movement in the trees
No lovers struggle for release
On the fallen autumn leaves

I've gotta know I'm not alone
Just one soul
I've gotta know I'm not alone
Just one soul
