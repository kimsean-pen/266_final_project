Lately I've been feeling gray
A little less human
A little less human
A little less human
Lately I've been feeling gray
A little less human
A little less human
A little less human
Lately I've been

Thinking about the ways I used to like to be
Maybe some day we'll create some harmony
Thinking 'bout a way to get all that I want
Maybe someday you could be the one
La-la-la-na-na, la-la-la
Lady come on
La-na-nah

Lately I've been feeling gray
A little less human
A little less human

Maybe I'm a bit less, maybe I'm a bit
Maybe I'm a bit less, maybe I'm a bit
Maybe I'm a bit less, maybe I'm a bit
Maybe I'm a bit less, maybe I'm a bit
Maybe I'm a bit less, maybe I'm a bit
Maybe I'm a bit less, maybe I'm a bit
Maybe I'm a bit less, maybe I'm a bit
Maybe I'm a bit less

Lately I've been feeling gray
A little less human
A little less human
Lately I've been feeling gray
A little less human
A little less human
A little less human
Lately I've been
Maybe I'm a bit less...
Lately I've been feeling gray
A little less human
A little less human
Lately I've been feeling gray
A little less human
A little less human
A little less human

Maybe I'm a bit less, maybe I'm a bit
Maybe I'm a bit less, maybe I'm a bit
Maybe I'm a bit less, maybe I'm a bit
Maybe I'm a bit less, maybe I'm a bit
Maybe I'm a bit less, maybe I'm a bit
Maybe I'm a bit less, maybe I'm a bit
Maybe I'm a bit less, maybe I'm a bit
Maybe I'm a bit less

Maybe I'm a bit less, maybe I'm a bit
Maybe I'm a bit less, maybe I'm a bit
Maybe I'm a bit less, maybe I'm a bit
Maybe I'm a bit less, maybe I'm a bit
Maybe I'm a bit less, maybe I'm a bit
Maybe I'm a bit less...
