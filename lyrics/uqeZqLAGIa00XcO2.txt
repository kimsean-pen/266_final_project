Waiting for you baby
through the cortestayz
huddled in the back seat of the van.
and i know a girl who would wait onto the stars
when she sings the heavens part
the part oooohhh oooohoohh

And I held my ground
but I heard those sounds
coming up
and I missed her cry
and I held those hands
so do you know what I mean
so do you know know how I feel
so do you know what i mean
baby, don't you know that, I love your snaggletooth
sea air broken when you love
baby, dont you know that I love those pigeon toes
I hope that you get these pigeon lungs
ah luuuuuu oooh ooooohoohh

And I held my ground
but I heard those sounds
coming up
and I missed her cry
and I held your hands
so do you know what i mean
so do you know how I feel
so do you know what I mean

And I will try my best
take this big old head
and I will know his name
always feel the same
and oh lit up so bright
and in that orange glow
oh lit up so bright
and in that orange glow

No ooooohh oooooohh ohhhohhh

And I held my ground
when I heard those sounds
coming up
and i missed her cry
and held those hands
so do you know what i mean
so do you know how i feel
so do you know, do you know
so do you know, do you know
so do you know, do you know
so do you know, do you know
so do know what I mean
