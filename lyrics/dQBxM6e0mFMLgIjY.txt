Look at me
Up in the sky
I watch the world just pass me by
And all my feelings
Give me away
It's happening more everyday

Loving you could be so easy
Loving you could be so great
Loving you could be so easy
Loving you could be so great

But how can I
Try to explain
Your story never seems to stay the same
You're out of touch
And I'm out of time
Just talk to me a while
And joke about
The things we used to see
Its so hard for me to smile

I've never felt so alone
After all of this there's
So much left to lose
And I'll take a piece of stone
I promise you I never meant to

Well how can I complain
When everybody seems to know my name
You're out of luck and I'm out of line
It's such a selfish comprimise
A self-indulgent useless bunch of lies
I never thought you would believe

Hold me now
Don't wake me up
Pull me down
And then back up
All again for all to see

Low down
Whisper
A guilty stare
Your stagnant beauty makes me glare
Silly games
In the sun
In the sun
In the sun
Oh in the sun

How can I complain
Your story never seems to stay the same
I'm out of luck and you're out of line
It's such a selfish compromise
A self-indulgent useless bunch of lies
I never thought you would believe

Go!

Loving you could be so easy
Loving you could be so great
Loving you could be so easy
Loving you could be so great

Well maybe a change will keep me high
Stop me thinking wondering why
