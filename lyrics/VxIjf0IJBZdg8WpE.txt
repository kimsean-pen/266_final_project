You're all over me
Step back over my spit
You're all over me
On the count of the place where I sit

You're all over me
Respect me or then this is it
You're all over me
Step back, step back

If you love me anymore
You would run me out
If you love me every thought
I would never doubt

If you love me anymore
You would run me out
If you love me every thought
I would never doubt

Little stream of consciousness
Better get ready
Better get ready
I'm a soldier
Already gone
I'm a soldier
Took this too far
I'm a soldier

If you love me anymore
You would run me out
If you love me every thought
I would never doubt

If you love me anymore
You would run me out
If you love me every thought
I would never doubt, yeah

Accept me everywhere
Everywhere I go
Accept me anywhere
And I will never show

Present me every dance
I hope we'll never suppose
For in me common sense
Keep us on our toes

If you love me anymore
You would run me out
If you love me every thought
I would never doubt

If you love me anymore
You would run me out
If you love me every thought
I would never doubt

World turn out
I am who I am
You, I, care
We, I am, you care
Yeah

Let's roll down with the brothers in the house
Big chill all the way to Streatham
All the way to Streatham, my friend
That's the way we roll out
Yeah, West London massive

Look at what you're viewing now
Genie, would you give me your real name?
Place on locked, not of the gang way
Limitations always

They should get laid out, played out, you know
Set to gauge range, straight to you friend
Stretched out, gamers, played out, over-run
Stretching out a lot of nothing

Got time for nothing
Gotta make something for-for-for-for-for
Something, something, something, some
