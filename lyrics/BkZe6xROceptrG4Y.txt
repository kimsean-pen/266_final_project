I should have quit you a long time ago
Ooh-whoa, yeah, yeah, long time ago
I wouldn't be here, my children
Down on this killin' floor

I should have listened, baby, a-to my second mind
Oh, I should have listened, baby, to my second mind
Everytime I go away and leave ya, darlin'

Hey, yeah-yeah-yeah, keep up, yeah, oh, yeah

Babe-yeahh, yeah, treat me right, baby
Ooh-whoa, whoa-whoa, my, my, my, my-hah

People tell me baby can't be satisfied-a
Try to worry me, b-ba-baby

People worry, baby, can't keep you satisfied
Huh, let me tall ya, babe
Ah, you ain't nothin' but a nn-two-bit, no-good jive

I went to sleep last night, I work as hard as I can-a
I bring home my money, you take my money, give it to another man
I should have quite you, baby
Oh, such a long time ago-ho
I wouldn't be hear with all my troubles
Down on this killin' floor

Squeeze me, babe, 'till the juice runs down my leg
Do, squeeze, squeeze me, baby, until the juice runs down my leg
The way you squeeze my lemon-a

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

No, no, now, now
I'm gonna leave my children down on this killing floor
