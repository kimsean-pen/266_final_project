I'll find a way to keep you
I couldn't live with the fear that
I fear that I'll find you
At the bottom of the sea
And I'll find you
At the bottom
Bottom of it

Salt settles in your wounds
With every violent spin
The ocean calls your name
And reaches with her arms
Her cursed lullaby
Will drown you in your sleep
Open your tired eyes
Drift softly on her waves

Do you remember what home feels like?
Can you assemble the pieces
Of our lives?

You sail a jealous sea
She brings you far from me
Wind whispers in your ear
And tells you you're alone
My dear, hold onto hope
And every piece of joy
Remember dignity
And don't give into fear

And every night was spent
Contemplating all the words you say
To me
I'll let them go
I'll let you go
