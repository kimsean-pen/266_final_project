Open up to the night
Our bed is underneath the heavy moon
Cast a doubt like a shadow walking
Through the corners of the room
I always thought I'd have a full tank to go
(But not tonight, you're running low)
I always thought I'd find my own way

What's going on in your head now
Maybe something I said
I know that you've been living in the past
What's going on in your head now
Maybe something I said now

It's driving me crazy
You can try to lie
But you're not gonna, not gonna deny
No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love
And you can run to the hillside
And you can close your eyes
But you're not gonna, not gonna deny
No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love
You can't deny my love

The eyes of God
Watching over us so we don't break the golden rules
The seven seas, have we learned
Or are we sailing on a ship of fools
I always thought I'd have a full tank to go
(But not tonight, you're running low)
I always thought we'd get there someday

It's driving me crazy
You can try to lie
But you're not gonna, not gonna deny
No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love
And you can run to the hillside
And you can close your eyes
But you're not gonna, not gonna deny
No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love
You can't deny my love

When you close your eyes, tell me what you see
Locked up in your room, is there any room for me?
In the spoils of your mercy, in the reverence of your bed
In the cradle of the morning, what was it that you said?
What's going on in your head now?

You're not gonna, not gonna deny
No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love
And you can run to the hillside
And you can close your eyes
But you're not gonna, not gonna deny
No you're not gonna, not gonna deny my love
You can't deny my love
