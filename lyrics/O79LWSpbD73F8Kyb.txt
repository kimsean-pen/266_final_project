I've only known her for a while
And she came as some surprise
I see the sunshine when she smiles
I feel the rain fall when she cries
She hits me in the heart
She drops me to my knees
And I don't know where I'd be without you
Sweet Louise

Oh, well she flies just like a bird
And she floats just like a dream
And she's the sweetest song I've heard
And the sweetest face I've seen
And she hits me in the heart
And she drops me to my knees
I don't know where I'd be without you
My sweet Louise

They say patience is a virtue
Yeah she wait, she won't desert you
She's got hands that couldn't hurt you if they tried
With all that happiness she has
Well she loves and understands me
But oh Lord I know she's always by my side
So if you please put me at ease
My sweet Louise

And she hits me in the heart
Oh and she drops me to my knees
I don't know know everything about you
Yeah but you give me no reason to doubt you
And I don't wanna be without you
Sweet Louise
Yeah
