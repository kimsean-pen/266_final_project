Tonight is the night it's the night of love
Forever and ever it's never enough
Tonight is the night it's the night of love
Together forever I can't get enough

Come on in mon, mu-huh

Hold me, hold me, ya squeeze me, squeeze me
Yes come and rid the lovin cause you know it's not easy
Hold me, hold me, yes nobody love me
Yes come and rid the music come receive the pardon
Yes run come give me love and come-a, give it to me
By the way you give me loving, give me, physically
And anything we do it, do it, naturally
Say come again we do it till we receive the pardon

Tonight is the night it's the night of love
Forever and ever it's never enough
Tonight is the night it's the night of love
Together forever I can't get enough

Oh, oh, oh, give me the night for love, I just can't get enough
Oh, oh, oh, give me the night for love, too much is not enough

Come down with it mon, mu-huh, stor pah-to
Now that you got my love and together we can make it
Don't anybody try to stop it people try to break it (uh huh)

Your love is what I want unless you give it to me
Yes, a-da-heh, a-da-heh, come quit the fights don't stop it
