Unloosen the sky
and suffer the sight
Then you walked out
in raging water

An offer that's died
What use in the white
endless sight
Indy I was always here to warn you

In this odyssey
it's hard to leave
I hold at the breach
I've got my reasons
In this odyssey
it's hard to leave
I hold at the breach
I've got my reasons

I wake to your likeness
but how come you're here
I wasn't found in delight
It's the call before it's far from over

Our temples are hearts
and then heaven alee
Heavy the final force
and I was downed in dying water

and I was downed in...

In this odyssey
it's hard to leave
I hold at the breach
I've got my reasons
In this odyssey
it's hard to leave
I hold at the breach
I've got my reasons (I'm cast out in the cold)

Now I'm wading water
Then I'm cast out in the cold
Heave that light up over you
Now I'm wading water
Then I'm in the boiling snow
Heave that light up where you go
Now I'm wading water
Then I'm cast out in the cold
Fading right, just once, we know
Now I'm wading water
Then I'm in the boiling snow
Heave that light off of you, love

In this odyssey
it's hard to leave
I hold at the breach
I've got my reasons (I'm cast out in the cold)
In this odyssey
it's hard to leave
I hold at the breach
I've got my reasons (I'm cast out in the cold)
