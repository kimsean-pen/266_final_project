Well I
I used to be your man and I was proud of it
Do anything you ask me to
Before I knew it you were runnin' round with him
What the hell was I supposed to do

Uh, what would you say if she was gone
Off with someone
Uh, what would you say if she was gone
Woah

Uh, what would you say if she was gone
Off with someone
Uh, what would you say if she was gone

He should be doin' what I done for you
Should be doin' what I done for you
He should be doin' what I done for you
Should be doin' what I done for you

I used to hope and pray that you would stay with me
Love is a fragile thing
But now it seems my hope for her was all for nothing
'Cause you done find another man

Uh, what would you say if she was gone
Off with someone
Uh, what would you say if she was gone
Woah

Uh, what would you say if she was gone
Off with someone
Uh, what would you say if she was gone

He should be doin' what I done for you
Should be doin' what I done for you
He should be doin' what I done for you
Should be doin' what I done for you

He should be doin' what I done for you
Should be doin' what I done for you
He should be doin' what I done for you
Should be doin' what I done for you
