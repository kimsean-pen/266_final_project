Changing the tone
Changing my mind
Changing the weather

I feel it at first
A blow from the dark
Take it for better

Still I remind myself
How I define myself

Blacker the bruise
Coming up clear
Vow to get better

Blessed with a curse
Hoping not far
The deeper, the better

I needed
I needed to know
I needed
I needed to know, why

Oh no
This can't be happening
Oh no
This can't be happening

Hate
Is a door
A fever burning for more
A red light
In your mind
That I feed on

You must've been so surprised to see
That you were staring back at me
Caught in a web, now
Out on your own
You've got nothing to stay for
Or so you keep saying

This year it's coming
And guess what we're running from
Too late for running
The stitches are coming undone

Grab your belongings
The exit is near
Making your way through
Indecisiveness

I needed
I needed to know
I needed
I needed to know, why

Oh no
This can't be happening
Oh no
This can't be happening

This myth is meant to die
You're coming blind in this madness
I'll bide all of my time for your love
Come on, crooked man you'll die
Like excuses pouring out a child
Sing: "S.O.S. you saint"
But make room for laughter
No man tried here

This water's dark and cold
God's not where you hoped
In this moment come and gone

It's too late, mayday
Call out: "Mayday!"
While I'm still alive
Hey, no matter

I don't want this to end
I don't want this to end
I don't want this to end
I don't think this will end well

Hey
There goes my love again
No-one's
Coming now
Hey
Out on my own again
Fading face
Broken frown

Hey
I guess I'm fucked up again
No-one
Will find out
Hey
Stare at your feet again
Don't say
You don't know

This water's dark and cold
God's not where you hoped
In this moment come and gone
It's time we all moved on
It's time we all moved on
It's time we all moved on

Away!!!

Still I remind myself
How I define myself
Still I remind myself
(I needed to know)
How I define myself
(I needed to know)
I needed to know
I needed
I needed to know

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

So if you like the sound of
The glass that breaks against the wall
I'd trade it all for several
Pieces of your anger
I am the interest of your heart
Say: "This would wash away"
I'm climbing this rope, I feel God
Would I care to stare you down?
I portray you in different light
