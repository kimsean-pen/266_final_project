It's going up on the notifications (turn it off, turn it off)
DM gotta go on vacation (turn it off, turn it off)
They ain't gotta know your current location (turn it off, turn it off)
'Cause tonight, we goin' private and nobody else allowed

(Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off) Keep your eyes on me
(Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off) Give you all the lights you need
(Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off) Turn it off for me, baby
'Cause tonight, we goin' private and nobody else allowed

I don't need another verification (turn it off, turn it off)
'Cause baby, you are my inspiration (turn it off, turn it off)
Got the DMs going on vacation (turn it off, turn it off)
'Cause tonight, we goin' private and nobody else allowed

(Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off) Keep your eyes on me
(Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off) Give you all the lights you need
(Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off) Turn it off for me, baby
'Cause tonight, we goin' private and nobody else allowed

We way up on lonely island, put that ringer up on silent
If it goes off, don't you try it, girl, I need you undivided
Paradise, girl, you define it, diamond waist, girl you so blinded
'Cause tonight, we goin' private and nobody else allowed
