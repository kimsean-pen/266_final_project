Beat him down, beat him down
Beat him down, beat him down
Beat him down, beat him down
Beat him down, beat him down
Break yoself hit the floor
Break yoself hit the floor
Break yoself, break yoself
Beat him down, beat him down
Beat him down, beat him down
Beat him down, beat him down
Beat him down, beat him down
Beat him down, beat him down
Break yoself hit the floor
Break yoself hit the floor
Break yoself, break yoself
Beat him down, beat him down
Beat him down, beat him down
Beat him down, beat him down
Beat him down, beat him down
Beat him down, beat him down
Break yoself, hit the floor
Break yoself, hit the floor
Break yoself, break yoself
Beat him down, beat him down

Walk up out the womb with my middle fingers up
For my cousin, I'm bussing, got the Nina tickety tucked
Smoking with the devil on that level, paranoid as shit
Got me on another binge, twisted on that dope and shit
I lose my mind, spree of crime, in the midst of time
Blood on my knife when I look into the high tide
Moonrise, rose up as the Anti-Christ, here to terrorize
Sleepy Hollow with this slice, good night

Beat him down, beat him down
Beat him down, beat him down
Beat him down, beat him down
Beat him down, beat him down
Break yoself hit the floor
Break yoself hit the floor
Break yoself, break yoself
Beat him down, beat him down

Tryna be the most hated motherfucker, fuck a name
Fuck a number, all I see is lame motherfuckers
Keep me ducking, I'll keep drugging
Ruin something, turn to nothing
Me and my cousin fucking struggling
Me and my cousin fucking hunting
Fuck a friend, where my enemies?
Who is who? Nothing to prove
Fuck a flex, I'll flex my bills,
I'm stressed, I ain't got nothing to lose
I'm depressed, I been a mess, but nonetheless got nothing to choose
Nothing to gain
Nothing but proof, nothing to change

Beat him down, beat him down
Beat him down, beat him down
Beat him down, beat him down
Beat him down, beat him down
Break yoself hit the floor
Break yoself hit the floor
Break yoself, break yoself
Beat him down, beat him down
