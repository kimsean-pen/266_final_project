Hoe I came a long way, face card good in the jungle
Put dicks on our Glocks and we stopped havin' problems
This a animal planet we fuck with no condoms
She suckin' me, fuckin' me without a condom
Bitch I'm the king of the jungle, I eat anacondas
We killin' these niggas and fuckin' their mamas
I will piss on your funeral and tell your ass, "Bonjour"

When I spin that revolver the world start evolvin'
Start poppin' these niggas and bitches start talkin'
My bullets be trippin', that's why niggas fallin'
Got rid of them pistols, we use them too often
Streets getting cold so we save up for coffee
These bullets got colds, that's why niggas start coughing
I hopped the gate when I heard walkie talkies
These pistols hot we're competing with coffee
S.A.N.D.A.S., suck a nigga dick ah something
These niggas better start running
Can't run from that cheetah, it's coming
I'm fucking your bitch with no condom on
I wanna feel all her meat and bones
Hitting these bitches like ping pong
Walk with bananas like King Kong
That Glock get to burning like gonorrhea
That choppa sound off, onomatopoeia
I'm shitting on nigga that diarrhea
These bitches is constipated,they ain't shit yeah

Hoe I came a long way, face card good in the jungle
Put dicks on our Glocks and we stopped havin' problems
This a animal planet we fuck with no condoms
She suckin' me, fuckin' me without a condom
Bitch I'm the king of the jungle, I eat anacondas
We killin' these niggas and fuckin' their mamas
I will piss on your funeral and tell your ass, "Bonjour"

I'm in the jungle like Steve Irwin
You're in the jungle like Steve Urkel
She giving bald head like Steve Harvey
Cross out my circle, we get Even Steven
Eve bit the apple like Steve Jobs
Hoe fuck bitin' apples, suck on these cocks
Clean up that nut, do not use a mop
Use your top
These niggas are rats so we snaking shit
Swiper no swiping, we taking shit
Start robbing these niggas, we don't pay for shit
These niggas is snitching on paper, bitch
My bitch from the jungle, she naked
Rob him for everything naked

Strong arm a nigga, we ape it
I'm painting her face with no apron
My memory full, I can't save bitches
These bitches gon' fuck on you
That's what made me start hating bitches
That pussy getting stretched out
These niggas getting stretched out
Their momma start stressing out

Hoe I came a long way, face card good in the jungle
Put dicks on our Glocks and we stopped havin' problems
This a animal planet we fuck with no condoms
She suckin' me, fuckin' me without a condom
