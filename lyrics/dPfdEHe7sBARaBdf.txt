It is my theory
The two of us are somewhat leery
About the happiness
We both set out to posses

We've got all the comforts of life
A few kids and you are my wife
And I tell it like it is
I must confess

I'm gonna have to give it up
I'm gonna have to give it up

All concern and the trusts that never happened with us
The walk of embraces and the love of our faces
It never happened you see and I'm so sorry

I really truly love you
And the kids you must agree
And I never had too much
Concern or interest in astrology

But as I read it must be so
The invulnerable word incompatible
No matter how much we try
Our indifference but still show

Now we've got give it up
I'm gonna have to give it up

All concern and the trusts that never happened with us
The walk of embraces and the love of our faces
It never happened you see and I'm so sorry

Now we've got give it up, ooh child
I've got to have to give it up
Lord, have mercy
Now I've got give it up, ooh
I've got to give it up

All concern and the trusts that never happened with us
The walk of embraces and the love of our faces
It never happened you see and I'm so sorry

But now we've got to give it up
What am I do?
Child, we've got to give it up
I'll be so lonely without you
But now I've got to give it up

Lord, forgive me, ooh
I've got to give it up, ooh
Now I've got to give it up
Lord, I have to give it up
