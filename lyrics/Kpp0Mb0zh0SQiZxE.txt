If I can't be the man
Tell me what I am
Tell me what I'm here for

If I can't be the one
Tell her what I've done
What good can I be for?

Did I not do enough
To save the two of us?
What more could I give her?

What more could I do
To see her point of view?
Why can't I believe her?

You got to make the change
I can't take you no more
These things you know
Do go, oh, ohh

Oh, Jamelia
You got to to go away
You can't come
Oh, ohh

You got to make the change
I can't take you no more
These things you know
Do go, oh, ohh

Oh, Jamelia
You got to to go away
You can't come
Oh, ohh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
