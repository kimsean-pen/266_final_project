Shoulders of perfection
Let them drag you straight across
And tell me, have we
Have we found perfection
Are we finally lost, and I'm
Staring from a distance
Why don't you come get a closer look
I can guarantee that lickin' the package
Ain't ever quite as good as...

So they're looking for a new face
With a voice to go along
I can tell you right now that ain't my style
I don't do no sing-alongs
With my freedom

From the mighty sky
To the ground, she said
You've got the freedom
Baby, walk out if they drag you down
If they drag you down

Standin' on the edge of a crisis
We decide to raise our own voices
Consider that the sound is our own and the
Fact our feet grow up from the ground, and
This is where I wanna be
This is who I wanna be
So they get my voice, but they can
They can never get my soul, yes
There's a million things about me you will never know

Like they caught me on video
And yeah they caught me on radio
Yeah they caught me on video, radio, stereo

Freedom, yeah
From the mighty sky
To the ground, she said
You've got the freedom
Baby, walk out if they drag you down

Freedom
They drag you
They drag you
They drag you

We're standing on the edge of a crisis
We decide to raise our own voices
Consider that the sound is our own and the
Fact our feet grow up from the ground, and
This is where I wanna be
This is who I wanna be
So they've got my voice, but they can
They can never get my soul, yes
There's a million things about me you will never know

Like they caught me on video
And yeah they caught me on radio
Yeah they caught me on video, radio, stereo

Freedom, yeah
From the mighty sky to the ground she said
You've got the freedom
Walk out if they drag you
If they drag you
They drag you
They drag you
You walk out
