Sometimes I can be perfectly sweet,
Got the sugary me all stuffed up in my sleeve
And I talk of ponies and rainbows and things
And I'm just who you want me to be
But, like most creatures down here on the ground
I'm composed of the elements moving around
And I grow and change and I shift and I switch
And it turns out I'm actually kind of a bitch
But that only happens when I get provoked
By some piece of shit asshole we all sadly know
And I sit and I write while reminding you all
That mean songs are still better than going postal

That guy's an asshole
And that girl's a bitch
Baby it's natural
No getting away from it
So sing it out with me
And then let it go
Fuck that guy he's just an asshole

Oh, asshole
Asshole
Asshole

I see I surprised you with some of my words
And I know that surprises, while fine, still can hurt
And I hate to think that I've ruined the day
Of the dick and the queen of the high horse parade
But I'm sick and tired of your poisonous ways
You're a toxin wasting perfectly good space
And I say what I think
'Cause it's more economic than drugs or a drink

That guy's an asshole
And that girl's a bitch
Baby it's natural
No getting away from it
So sing it out with me
And then let it go
Fuck that guy he's just an asshole

And I won't let him in
Under my skin
You're a sad sack of shit
It's pathetic
Just a festering sore
Who will never be more than that
If I don't let him

That guy's an asshole
And that girl's a bitch
Baby it's natural
No getting away from it
So sing it out with me
And then let it go
Fuck that guy he's just an asshole

That guy's an asshole
And that girl's a bitch
Baby it's natural
No getting away from it
So sing it out with me
And then let it go
Fuck that guy he's just an asshole
