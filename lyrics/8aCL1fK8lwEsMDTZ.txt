(I don't think that you are sorry for what you did)

I don't think that you are sorry for what you did
(I don't think that you are sorry for what you did)
I don't think that you are sorry for what you did

I know you need it
And you just don't know how to quit

I don't think that you are sorry for what you did
(I don't think that you are sorry for what you did)
I don't think that you are sorry for what you did

I know you need it
And you just don't know how to quit

It's too late
But tomorrow has to wait
It's the time of your life
So tomorrow has to wait
Tonight's the night
And tomorrow is a million miles away

It's too late
But tomorrow has to wait
It's the time of your life
So tomorrow has to wait
If you control yourself
Then give up before you break
Well it's too late

I don't think that you are sorry for what you did
(I don't think that you are sorry for what you did)
I don't think that you are sorry for what you did
(I don't think that you are sorry for what you did)

It's too late
But tomorrow has to wait
It's the time of your life
So tomorrow has to wait
Tonight's the night
And tomorrow is a million miles away

It's too late
But tomorrow has to wait
It's the time of your life
So tomorrow has to wait
If you control yourself
Then give up before you break
Well it's too late
