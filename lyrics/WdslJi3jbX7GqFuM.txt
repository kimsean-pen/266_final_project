I think, I think too much
I'm a little bit paranoid, I think I'm breaking
Maybe it's in my blood
Got a pain that I can't avoid, I think I'm breaking down

Hate every single second, minute, hour, every day
Person in the mirror, they won't let me feel a thing
Keep me focused on my problems, I'm addicted to the pain
Everybody's out to get you

I guess I never noticed how it came creeping in
My enemy emotion but I can't sink or swim
I say I'm feeling hopeless, they give me medicine
They give me medicine, they give me medicine

I think, I think too much
I'm a little bit paranoid, I think I'm breaking
Maybe it's in my blood
Got a pain that I can't avoid, I think I'm breaking
Down, I think I'm breaking
Down, I think I'm breaking
I think, I think too much
I'm a little bit paranoid, I think I'm breaking down

Lies, every time they ask me I just tell 'em that I'm fine
Try to hide my demons but they only multiply
Keep me running from the voices on repeat inside my mind
Everybody fucking hates you

I guess I never noticed how it came creeping in
My enemy emotion but I can't sink or swim
I say I'm feeling hopeless but no one's listening
But no one's listening, but no one's listening

I think, I think too much
I'm a little bit paranoid, I think I'm breaking
Maybe it's in my blood
Got a pain that I can't avoid, I think I'm breaking
Down, I think I'm breaking
Down, I think I'm breaking
I think, I think too much
I'm a little bit paranoid, I think I'm breaking down

I don't really like myself
I don't really like myself
I don't really like myself
I don't really like myself
I think I'm breaking down
