I'm gonna paste you up
Cover you in wallpaper
Screw shelves into you
And call you a wall

That's all you are to me
Tryna keep people inside
Inside your sordid little house
This is no white abode

You can have skirting board shoes
And plug sockets on your knees
I'll hang a painting on your lip
And put tinsel round it at Christmas

Tryna keep people inside
Inside your sordid little house
Tryna keep people inside
Inside your sordid little house

You can't keep us inside much longer pal
We've seen the view from the window
You can't keep us inside much longer pal
We've seen the view from the window

It's glorious outside
Have you seen the time?
Have you seen the tide?

We'll sing all night
We need cohesion
We need cohesion

As time keeps moving
We keep losing our rights
Freedom is not the choices
Between what job and what car

You can just look back into history
To find corruption and mystery
And if we don't take note
We'll wake up on the same boat

Tryna keep people inside
Inside your sordid little house
Tryna keep people inside
Inside your sordid little house

It's glorious outside
Have you seen the time?
Have you seen the tide?

We'll sing all night
We need cohesion
We need cohesion

Have you seen the time?
Have you seen the tide?

Grit ya teeth then break the glass
Now sprint and don't look back
Full pelt into the dense forest and ask him

What's your thoughts on lionizing?
What's your thought on tensions rising?
Deep in the dense forest

Tryna keep people inside
Inside your sordid little house
Tryna keep people inside
Inside your sordid little house

Tryna keep people inside
Inside your sordid little house
Tryna keep people inside
Inside your sordid little house
