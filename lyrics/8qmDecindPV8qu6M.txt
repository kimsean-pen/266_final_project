Without Space
Without Time
I Am Deaf
I Am Blind
Without Motion
Without Sound
Like A Flower
Underground
Isolation-Demarkation
Solitary Separation
No More Joy
No More Sadness
No Emotion
Only Madness

I Can't See
I Don't Feel
I Can't Touch
I Don't Heal

Corrosion From Within
No Future
No Resistance In The Cell
No More
