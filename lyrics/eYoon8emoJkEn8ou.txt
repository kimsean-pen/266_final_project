Everybody needs a little tenderness
Everybody needs a release
From the cell they lock themselves in
Love is the only peace

Everybody needs, everybody cries
Everybody bleeds, everybody dies
Everybody dreams, everybody wakes
Everybody makes mistakes
Love one another, sisters and brothers
Love one another -- hey ... hey ...
Love one another, father and mother
Love one another

It's easier to walk away when you've got a wounded pride
When two people stand together that's how they heal inside
Try to understand
Open up your heart
A fist is just a hand
It can come apart
Let go of the past, let go of the fight
Forgiving fills the world with light

Love one another, sisters and brothers
Love one another -- hey ... hey ...
Love one another, father and mother
Love one another
Love one another
Love one another

We were given a world so beautiful
A deep ocean, a blue, blue sky
I know we can make it a better place
If only you and I

(to fade)
Love one another, sisters and brothers
Love one another -- hey ... hey ...
Love one another, father and mother
Love one another
love one another

Love one another, sisters and brothers
Love one another -- hey ... hey ...
Love one another, father and mother
Love one another
love one another
Baby, baby

You've got to give
You've got to love
You've got to give
You've got to love
(repeat to fade)
