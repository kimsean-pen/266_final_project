Weather's getting colder
Winter claims the land
It is said the Queen is dressed in
the warmest gown in the whole land

They say it is a wonder
a dress is made of thunder,
The Wolves, who cannot see it
will one day dethrone the Queen

The citizens all cover
the beauty of the power
Makes them see a flower
bloom in the Winter Wonder Land

The walls keep getting closer
breath fear in your cage,
from the Queen will hear today
the reason in the rhymes
children play

The Queen is naked
and no one sees her amber eyes
Now the innocent kneel down
and ask forgiveness for their lies

The court,
the meek,
will obey the tyrant Queen
Bring us their heads for...

This is the day when the wolves die young
They'll never see a new midnight sun
I'm gonna make sure the prophecy is undone
Find out where those children have run

Mutiny is rising
against the wall of fear
Mirror, miror of the fall
sees her final spiraling
downfall

The Queen is naked
and no one sees her amber eyes
Now the innocent kneel down
and ask forgiveness for their lies

The court,
the meek,
will obey the tyrant Queen

This is the day when the wolves die young
They'll never see a new midnight sun
I'm gonna make sure the prophecy is undone
Find out where those children have run

This is the day when the wolves die young
They'll never see a new midnight sun
I'm gonna make sure the prophecy is undone
Find out where those children have run

Find out where those children have run
Find out where those children have run
