Mount st. helens is about to blow
up and it's gonna be a fine swell day.

Everything's gonna fall down to the ground and turn grey.

All of my friends, family, and animals are probably going to run away

But me, I'm feeling curious so i think i just might stay.

The dow jones just fell down to
zero and it's gonna be a fine swell day.

And i wonder if it's gonna be as good a day as yesterday.

All of these business suits that I've just purchased,
Gonna have to throw them all away.
And slip into something more reasonable and then dance the night away.

I'm riding a pony, into the sunset.
Everything's green and gold, so I'm not in hell yet.

And the people who work in my office went on vacation,
Cause they said that i haven't been paying them very much anymore.

Mount st. helens has a pretty cool gift shop
and i haven't been there in a while!
And I've been wondering if it's even still there.

And the climate has been changing and soon it's gonna change more.

And we'll figure out all of the details in climate change court.

Take a ride on my blimp, oh it's a very strong blimp.

You can watch movies and play games while riding on it.

And when the sun goes down,
and the sky burns out, we'll never slow down.
Oh we're not going down.

Mount st. helens is feeling crazy and
adventurous, that's the reason that it's so special.

And it takes no answers,
and it gives no questions,
and it makes no excuses,
and it really doesn't listen,
and it seems so eccentric,
and it looks so active,
and it dreams of puppies,
and it's filled with music!
