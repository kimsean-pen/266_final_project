I can see it
I can feel it
I can point it, it's heading straight, straight to the brain
I don't stop it
I don't reject it
I don't shoot it down what I see, what I have, what I feel

See, now it's so shining in my eyes
See, now it's so shining in your head
When it fills up the land
So sweet scape we get called chaos

It's knocking you, it's cracking
It's shouting out, here's my chain-shot

I can laugh out
I can cry out
I can ask my head, stinging, cutting, beating smashing cells
But you don't see
But you don't care
I just need to set the seed to blow and then shoot out

Next warhead could be my hatred
Next warhead could be your sorrow
Bet what your head will squeak out
Choose the next one or you'll be dead

It's knocking you, it's cracking
It's shouting out, here's my chain-shot
It's knocking you, it's cracking
It's shouting out, here's my chain-shot
Next chain-shot, my chain-shot

Hate to the one, bait to the next shot
Sad to the one, laugh to the next shot
Joy to the one, craze to the next shot

Pick it, dig it, kick it
Keen kids say, "I got a headache bad!"

See, now it's so shining in my eyes
See, now it's so shining in your head
When it fills up the land
So sweet scape we get called chaos

It's knocking you, it's cracking
It's shouting out, here's my chain-shot

Next warhead could be my hatred
Next warhead could be your sorrow
Bet what your head will squeak out
Choose the next one or you'll be dead

It's knocking you, it's cracking
It's shouting out, here's my chain-shot
It's knocking you, it's cracking
It's shouting out, here's my chain-shot
Next chain-shot, dear chain-shot
