I feel I'm done with this shell of mine
Separated from the one I knew
I'll kill every minute on hold
While the ocean brings me back to life
I've lived, I've breathed, I've learned to be deceived
Sheltered for what it's worth, forced to make it work
I feel I'm chosen to see what others haven't seen
It's not a tragedy, it's just reality but how it makes me believe

Now I see a spectrum of eternity - The remedy is yours
A thousand of demands, a never-ending glance of fate... Of fate
I'm yours... I'm yours

Three years since I was reborn, a brutal insight
Never knew it could do so much to stir my soul up
It's been relentless, I've felt deprived of my own life
Stuck on the other side of who I was enlightened by

Embrace me, for one last time, take me there
Something's out there and it won't leave me astray

SOLO: Andersson

Embrace me, for one last time, take me there...
Something's out there and it won't leave me astray
A thousand of demands, a never-ending glance of fate... Of fate
I'm yours... I'm yours
