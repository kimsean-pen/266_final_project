You got it on the side
A little one night thing
I've bought it over and it's time I will forgive you
Well I'm not letting go
But don't forget I know
You made your bed and she was in it, no no no

What's she gonna look like with a chimny on her
What's she gonna look like with a chimny on her
What's she gonna look like with a chimny on her
What's she gonna look like with a chimny on her

Well, I'm not blaming you
But you're still hangin' round
And she's so crazy, tell you now I just don't trust her
She thinks she's right on time
But I think she crossed the line
But I'm ready for the ride I'm ready if it's, but in time

What's she gonna look like with a chimny on her
What's she gonna look like with a chimny on her
What's she gonna look like with a chimny on her
