Put your sneakers on
Put your sneakers on
We're going dancing all night long

I've got somewhere to be
I want you to come with me
See I've put my sneakers on
Cause I'm gonna keep dancing
After they all go home

So are you ready?
Did you eat?
Do you have the energy?
Are you reloaded?
Are you able to stay on your feet?
Don't want you passing out
After a couple hours of beats
We're keep going
And going
And going
Yeah, cause

Basically what we're gonna do is dance
Basically what we're gonna do is dance
Basically what we're gonna do is dance
It will come easily when you hear the beat, oh
Basically what we're gonna do is dance
Basically what we're gonna do is dance
All you gotta do is take a chance
Yeah, that's right, it's sneakernight

So now they're closing
Close it up, shut it down, go home now
But this far from the end
Second round, ding, it's about to begin
Cause I got comfortable full
Where the weather is nice
So let's take it outside
Just need some hand clap and the beatbox
And it's all right

Basically what we're gonna do is dance
Basically what we're gonna do is dance
Basically what we're gonna do is dance
It will come easily when you hear the beat, oh
Basically what we're gonna do is dance
Basically what we're gonna do is dance
All you gotta do is take a chance
Yeah, that's right, it's sneakernight

When the sun goes down
When we wake up
A good night sleep, no need
No problem staying awake
When the beat is like an earthquake
We're unstoppable
We're uncontrollable
Just admit it, you can't stop it, it's addictive

Basically what we're gonna do is dance
Basically what we're gonna do is dance
Basically what we're gonna do is dance
It will come easily when you hear the beat, oh
Basically what we're gonna do is dance
Basically what we're gonna do is dance
All you gotta do is take a chance
Yeah, that's right, it's sneakernight

Oh, put your sneakers on
Let's go all night long
