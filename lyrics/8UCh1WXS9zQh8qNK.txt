Every time you go, I cry
Oceans pouring from my eyes
Every moment seems so slow
Every time you go

Are you trying to hide?
Are you keeping it under the surface?
Are you trying to find a way to reach me?
Do you want me to know?
But you just don't wanna have to tell me?
Feelings below, you go again

Every time you go, I cry
Oceans pouring from my eyes
Every moment seems so slow
Every time you go

Is it good enough to know it's enough?
'Cause I need to know that you need my love
Is it good enough? (Good enough, good enough, good enough, good enough, good enough, good enough)
Is it good enough to know it's enough?
'Cause I need to know that you need my love
Is it good enough? (Good enough, good enough, good enough, good enough, good enough, good enough)

Every time you go, I cry (Cry, cry, I cry)
Oceans pouring from my eyes
Every moment seems so slow
Every time you go
Every time you go, I cry (Cry)
Oceans pouring from my eyes
Every moment seems so slow
Every time you go
Every time you go, I cry
Oceans pouring from my eyes
Every moment seems so slow
(Every moment, every moment, every moment)
Every time you go
Every time you go
