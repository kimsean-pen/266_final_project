(Ahh)

I've been to all the parties
And it wasn't there
I followed where my heart leads
It wasn't there
Screamed at the top of my
Lungs and no one cared
Oh, oh, oh
I've searched up on the
Mountaintops, it wasn't there
I drove a Maserati, no fulfillment there
I've run around the whole
Damn world to get back here
Oh, oh, oh

Now let me feel high when I'm sober
Let me feel young when I'm older
Let me feel proud when it's over
I finally realized, all of this time
It was in me
All along, it was in me

I took the time to listen and
I found it here (Ahh)
I stopped to see the vision
And it was clear (Ahh)
Everyone's got an opinion
But I don't care
Oh, oh, oh

Now let me feel high when I'm sober
Let me feel young when I'm older
Let me feel proud when it's over
I finally realized, all of this time
It was in me
All along, it was in me

Oh, and I
All I needed was a little faith in my life
All I needed was a little trust in myself
All I needed was to find the truth in my heart
Ah-ha, ah-ha, ahh

So let me feel high when I'm sober
Let me feel young when I'm older
Let me feel proud when it's over

Yeah, it was in me
(Let me feel high when I'm sober)
It was in me
(Let me feel young when I'm older)
Let me feel proud when it's over
I finally realized, all of this time
It was in me
All along, it was in me
