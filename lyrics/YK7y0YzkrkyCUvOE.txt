I was waiting for the sun
Then I walked on home alone
What I didn't know
Was he was waiting for you to fall

So I never made amends
For the sake of no one else
And for the simple reason
That he was waiting for you to fall

Chorus:
It was not lost on me
It was not lost on me
Walking on down the road
Looking for a friendly handout
Somebody ease my soul

So I kept my spirits high
Entertaining passers-by
Wrapped in my confusion
While he was waiting for you to fall

(Chorus)

It was not lost on me
It was not lost on me
Walking on down the road
Walking on down the road
Walking on down the road
Walking on down the road
