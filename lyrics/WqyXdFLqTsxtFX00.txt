Wide awake, my mistake
So predictable
You were fake, I was great
Nothing personal

I'm walking
Who's laughing now?
(Who's laughing, who's laughing now?)
I'm wasted, wasting time
You talk for hours
But you're wasting lines
A pretty face but the chase
Ain't worth the prize...

I'm gonna break your little heart
Watch you take the fall
Laughing all the way to the hospital
'Cause there's nothing surgery can do
When I break your little heart in two
I'm gonna break your little heart in two

Party queen, cause a scene
So ridiculous
Little dress, maybe less
So conspicuous

You're falling
Who's crashing now?
(Who's crashing, who's crashing now?)
I'm wasted, wasting time
I'm moving on
But you're left behind
A pretty face, but the chase
Ain't worth the prize...

I'm gonna break your little heart
Watch you take the fall
Laughing all the way to the hospital
'Cause there's nothing surgery can do
I'm gonna break your little heart
Show you to the door
Sew yourself shut
Now you're beggin' for more
'Cause there's nothing surgery can do
When I break your little heart in two

Don't be so sentimental, no
This love is accidental, so
Give it up
This was never meant to be
More than a memory for you...

I'm gonna break your little heart
Watch you take the fall
Laughing all the way to the hospital
'Cause there's nothing surgery can do
I'm gonna break your little heart
Show you to the door
Sew yourself shut
Now you're beggin' for more
'Cause there's nothing surgery can do
When I break your little heart in two
