Yeah
Check it out

You see me sitting here, a smile upon my face
(Face)
The time has come but you know that it's not too late
There's been too many things together we have seen
It's not that hard if we start to believe
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain? So please

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
The answer to our life?
Check it out

This world is not at ease but we seem to hide the truth
Thinking there's only so much we can really do
It's up to you and me to fix our destiny
The jury's here, so let's take the stand
And we're not gonna take anymore

Can we try to erase all the pain? So please
Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
(Fall out of line)
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
(We will find)
The answer to our life?
So tell me why we have to cry?

(And I try)

When there's so many things we can do
To help this troubled world start anew
I need a reason, I need a sign
There's no turning back, I'm here by your side
Is it today or maybe tonight
(We'll find)
The answer to our life?
Show me the way, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
(Line)
Is it today, is it tonight

(Is it today)
The answer to our life?

Show me a reason
(Show me a reason)
Give me a sign

(Give me a sign)
Tell me the way we fall out of line
(Fall out of line)
Is it today, is it tonight we will find
(Is it today)
The answer to our life?
Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
(Don't fall out of line)
Is it today or is it tonight we'll find
(We will, we will)
The answer to our life?
