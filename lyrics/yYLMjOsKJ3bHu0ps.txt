I've been lying in the park for ages
I've been staring at the trees
Cold, bright and sunny morning

I've been lying in the park for ages
Getting covered up with leaves
Feeling dirty, sick and tired
Gets me feeling so diseased
Guess I'll get myself up and walk down the street

Oh yeah I really see it now
As clear as mud to me
I just don't believe
Oh yeah I really see it now
I'm just a boy to me
I just don't believe anything I say
Don't believe anything I say

I've been staring at a silver ceiling
Seeing things I don't wanna see
And it kills me every time
How you got away from me
Seems my mind is more a prison now I'm free

Oh yeah I really see it now
As clear as mud to me
I just don't believe
Oh yeah I really see it now
I'm just a boy to me
I just don't believe anything I say
Don't believe anything I say

I'll be thinking 'bout these words forever
Still I'm ending up with me
Why'd I go wasting all your time?
Why did I wanna set you free?
How could I think I'd be happier lonely?

Oh yeah I really see it now
As clear as mud to me
I just don't believe
Oh yeah I really see it now
I'm just a boy to me
I just don't believe anything I say
Don't believe anything I say

I'll be thinking 'bout these words forever (x4)
