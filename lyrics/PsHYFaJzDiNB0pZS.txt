Honey, why do you wanna bleed? You know me
Why do you wanna bleed? You know me
Why do you wanna bleed? You know me
Why do you wanna bleed? You know me

When you're way up in your head
Would you care for love? Would you?
When you're in over your head
Would you care if we touch? If we touch

You like the rush, yeah, I know you do
You know to touch every inch of you
So chase the money and pray for love
We don't even care 'bout who we are

Won't you come and chase me?
Baby, don't you wanna chase me?
Don't you wanna chase me?

Honey, why do you wanna bleed? You know me
Why do you wanna bleed? You know me
Honey, why do you wanna bleed? You know me
Why do you wanna bleed? You know me
Why do you wanna bleed? You know me
Why do you wanna bleed? You know me

And it lingers on my bed
Your memory, your memory
I'm right here but now you're gone
How do I swim right through an ocean of you

You like the rush, yeah, I know you do
You know to touch every inch of you
So chase the money and pray for love
We don't even care 'bout who we are

Won't you come and chase me?
Baby, don't you wanna chase me?
Don't you wanna chase me?

Honey, why do you wanna bleed? You know me
Why do you wanna bleed? You know me
Why do you wanna bleed? You know me
Why do you wanna bleed? You know me

Honey, honey, honey

It's in my head
It's in your love
Would you dare to re-adjust
It's in your love
Would you dare to re-adjust
It's in your love
Would you dare to re-adjust
