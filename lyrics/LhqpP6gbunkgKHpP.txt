No one knows
The walls that we've climbed
The knots we've untied
The shots that we've fired
I have alot of "friends"
Who want what we've made
But don't know the pain
The beasts that we've slain
There's a lot of sharks
That swim in these waters
They came for your sons
They came for your daughters
If you got a lot of heat
It just makes it hotter
The blood in this water's
Making us stronger

No one knows
The walls that we've climbed
The knots we've untied
The shots that we've fired
I have alot of "friends"
Who want what we've made
But don't know the pain

The beasts that we've slain

We fight
We bleed
We live
We breathe
We fall beneath
Incomplete
We rise
We fall
We chase it all

We raise it up
Incomplete

No one sees
The pace that we speed
The red that we bleed
The scars on our knees
I've met a lot of friends
With halos and wings
That kiss when they hug
But kill when they sting
No one ever said
There wouldn't be waves
Sometime's shovels have to dig graves
I've burned a lot of matches

Tryin' to make flames
And lips can sink ships
But prayers create change

No one knows
The walls that we've climbed
The knots we've untied
The shots that we've fired

I have alot of "friends"
Who want what we've made
But don't know the pain
The beasts that we've slain

We fight
We bleed
We live
We breathe
We fall beneath
Incomplete

We rise
We fall
We chase it all
We raise it up
Incomplete

And I won't let this fade away from you
I won't stop until you do
And I won't wait I'll run when You say move

I'll stand and I'll fight for you
We fight
We bleed
We live
We breathe
We fall beneath

Incomplete
We rise
We fall
We chase it all

We raise it up
Incomplete
We fight
We bleed
We live
We breathe
We fall beneath
Incomplete
We rise
We fall
We chase it all
We raise it up
Incomplete
