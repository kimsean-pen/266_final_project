Used to know how to do this without losing my cool
But you crept too much inside my head
Rolling over in my bed, tangled up in what you said
Terrified this just might never end
Easy are my tethers, oh, giving you all I got but you claim it ain't whole
It's the best I can do
Nothing is ever good enough for you
Easy are my tired eyes, we've been up all night 'cause my mind is tight
It's the best I can do
Nothing is ever good enough for you
Chasing the days away, back and forth this game we play
It's sickening but we can not quit
How do we?? so far down when I?? into the ground pulled us up
But we still drown
Easy are my tethers, giving you all I got but you claim it ain't whole
It's the best I can do
Nothing is ever good enough for you
Easy are my tired eyes, we've been up all night 'cause my mind is tight
It's the best I can do
Nothing is ever good enough for you
I went down on my knees
Begging for release
Can't continue like this, no, oh
So could you please
Change your eyes to see this is no way to be, no, oh
I went down on my knees
Begging for release
Can't continue like this, no
So could you please
Change your eyes to see this is no way, no way, no way to be
Easy are my tethers, oh, giving you all I got but you claim it ain't whole
It's the best I can do
Nothing is ever good enough for you
Easy are my tired eyes, we've been up all night 'cause my mind is tight
It's the best I can do
Nothing is ever good enough for you
