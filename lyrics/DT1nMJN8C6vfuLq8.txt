I wake to a fire in the night
A little lying safe and sound
It's a wild life, so wild, crazy
Cannot tame the crowd
Like beast in the hole, you're MIA
A little hell, you're gonna pay
You're whole at home, a telephone
The king that's here to stay

Sleep and awaking to life, for a hell of a ride
Sleep and awaking to life, with your hands at your side, paralyzed
Paralyzed, paralyzed, paralyzed

Out cold in the gentle rain, it's dark
A little lying set your fire
Push away and go, the stereo
A tear ruled death to part
19 with a wicked MRE
What a waste, a memory
Got a steady heart, you played your part
And now get down to the sea

Sleep and awaking to life, for a hell of a ride
Sleep and awaking to life, with your hands at your side

It's more the same, a silly old shame
A dimly lit road, it will wither and go
I climb the light post, illuminate the road
For miles away, so safely on your way

Sleep and awaking to life, for a hell of a ride
Sleep and awaking to life, with your hands at your side

Sleep and awaking to life, for a hell of a ride
Sleep and awaking to life, with your hands at your side, paralyzed
Paralyzed, paralyzed, paralyzed
