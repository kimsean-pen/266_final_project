Hear them whisper
Voices from the other side
Hear them calling

Former foes now friends are resting side by side
They will never leave
Our hearts or fade away
Live forever

They were far to young to die in such a way
How many wasted lives
How many dreams did fade away
Broken promises they won't be coming home

Oh mothers wipe your tears
Your sons will rest a million years
Found their peace at last
As foe turned to friend and forgive

And they knew they'd die
Gallipoli
Left their letters in the sand
Such waste of life

Gallipoli
Dreams of freedom turned to dust
Hell is waiting where the ocean meets the sand

Cliffs of burden
Where the soldiers rushed into a certain death
At the shoreline
Blood of heroes stains the land light a candle

One for each of them who fought and died in vain
There is no enemy
There is no victory
Only boys who lost their lives in the sand
Young men were sacrificed

Their names are carved in stone and kept alive
And forever we will honour the memory of them
And they knew they would die
Gallipoli
Left their letters in the sand

Such waste of life
Gallipoli
Dreams of freedom turned to dust
How many wasted lives
How many dreams did fade away

Broken promises
They won't be coming home
Oh mothers wipe your tears
Your sons will rest a million years

Found their peace at last
As foe turned to friend and forgive
And they knew they would die
Gallipoli

Left their letters in the sand
Such waste of life
Gallipoli
Dreams of freedom turned to dust.
