I care too much
While you don't even care at all
It's just sad that
You don't even care

I walk up
The stairs to your apartment
And I feel small
The lowest feelings and even lower standards

Pictures of simple times are on the top shelf
You lie to me and say you're happy with the way things are
(with the way things are)

It's just sad, oh it's sad that you don't even care at all

I want to carry you
But I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you

I spent so much damn time
Trying to move forward
It hurts me to watch you falling backwards
Brave your life
Finding solutions not making excuses
Find solutions and stop waiting for excuses

I want to carry you
But I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you

I care too much, while you don't even care at all
A bit much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all
It's too much while you don't even care at all

I want to carry you
But I'll just keep worrying about you
Don't settle because you're scared of being alone
You know I always pictured things to be different for you
