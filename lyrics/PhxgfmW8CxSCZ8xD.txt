There was an old woman who sat in the tree
On the side of the road
The other side of the hill
There was a river rushing by with no time to say hello
And have you seen my daughter
No time to say hello
Have you seen my son
Please excuse me mister
No time to say hello
No time to say hello
No time at all
Please excuse me mister
Have you seen my daughter
Have you seen my daughter
Have you seen my daughter
Hexed by a wizard some years prior
She lives cross-eyed like the Tower of Pisa
She was born in the prettiest
Of six girls
Now toothless can't even get a job
With no time to say hello
And have you seen my daughter
No time to say hello
Please excuse me mister
Have you seen my daughter
I'm her only mother
I'm your only mother
