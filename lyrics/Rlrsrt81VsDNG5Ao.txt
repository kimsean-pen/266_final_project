I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo in so much space
And when you're out there
Without care, yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy? Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy? Possibly

An I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
Mmm...
Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you
Who do you think you are?
Ha ha ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control

Well, I think you're crazy, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy, just like me

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
An all I remember is thinking I wanna be like them
Mmm...
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
It was no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

But maybe I'm crazy, but maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy, probably
Probably
Just like me
Just like me
Just like me
