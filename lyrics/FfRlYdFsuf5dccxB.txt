At it again, skip to the end
Cut on the mend, it's a wheel

Gift of the gab (Told you so)
Good with a bag (Gift of the gab)
Slave to the trap
And though we're shook up
Counting tick tock

Skip to the beat
Get a part in the band
Heat in the heart
With the meat in your hand
Just takes a spark
Took a shine, took a stand
Just a little bit the other way
And then we'll make a plan
And then

Kicking the can quick as I can
Did it again, eureka

Guy on the ropes (Yes, you can)
Don't give up hopes (Start again)
Slip on the slopes
And though we're messed up
Wounded and dressed up

Skip to the beat
Get the part in the band
Heat in the heart
With the meat in your hand
Just takes a spark
Took a shine, took a stand
Just a little bit the other way
And then we'll make a plan
You think

Why did I fly so high?
Why did I fly so high?
Why did I fly so high?
Why did I fly so high?
