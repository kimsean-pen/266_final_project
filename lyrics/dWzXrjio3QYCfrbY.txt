Am I not pretty enough for ya?
Do I not have the narrative?
You need to like my aesthetic?
Am I not cute enough to remember?
I've adjusted my perspective
Don't wanna be part of your clique

But somethings got me caught up
I won't be made the fool of
Won't be the poster girl that you want

So what are you after?
Don't you like my colours?
I'm confident, I know it scares ya, scares ya
Bye bye good riddance
The rules have been rewritten
I'm better without you, and that's the truth
I'm not part of your agenda

Ah, ah
Am I not dainty enough for ya?
Do I not wear that pretty dress?
Do I not fake it like the rest?
Am I not finding strength in numbers?
'Cause you know I'm fine here on my own
Don't need to make you love my home

When you say I'm annoying
It's not me your destroying
'Cause I know who I am, and I'm better than that
'Cause you've got that taste in people
If I'm not one then I'm grateful
You're just shooting blanks and you can take that to the bank

So what are you after?
Don't you like my colours?
I'm confident, I know it scares ya, scares ya
Bye bye good riddance
The rules have been rewritten
I'm better without you, and that's the truth
I'm not part of your agenda
