We're bad friends

You're reading out loud
Outside the door
I'm in the tub
The crack's a jar

In the bad world
For dreamers
Night time
Lolita

Making out plans
For a new world
I am yours only
But not your girl

White knuckles
We're bad friends
Loose buckles
My conscience

(Ooh ooh)
We're bad friends
(Ooh ooh)

I want that thunder
(Thunder)
Coming up like a fever
(Fever)
I want that thunder
(Thunder)
Coming up like a fever
Yeah!

Thunder
(Thunder)
Coming up like a fever
(Fever)
I want that thunder
(Thunder)
Coming up like a fever
Yeah!

We're bad friends
(Ooh)

We're driving real fast
Inside the car
Then you light up
I count the stars

In the bad world
For dreamers
Night time
Lolita

Gotcha out my mind
A week or two
Feel so lost
When I'm not with you

Glass bottles
We're bad friends
Loose buckles
My conscience

(Ooh ooh)
We're bad friends
(Ooh ooh)

I want that thunder
(Thunder)
Coming up like a fever
(Fever)
I want that thunder
(Thunder)
Coming up like a fever
Yeah!

Thunder
(Thunder)
Coming up like a fever
(Fever)
I want that thunder
(Thunder)
Coming up like a fever
Yeah!

We're bad friends
(Ooh ooh)

We're bad friends
(Ooh)

Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!

We're bad friends
