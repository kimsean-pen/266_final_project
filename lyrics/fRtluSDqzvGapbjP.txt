never dreamt i'd meet someone like you
all unwanted features build the unity of you
but i like you

you see the overall of what we are
is it a sad sad sight viewed from afar
why don't you call

whatever made you into clump like you
the icing cold that leaks out through cracks of you
makes us as new
whatever made you seem so very small
are you tiny in real life but large in thought
who's standing tall

cannot wait until i get my hands on you
we can do the things we said we would

you never had a true friend like i
someone to pick you up when you needed to
be carried through
if my hands weren't so very sharp
this broken glass that surrounds wherever we are
wouldn't do us part

whatever made you into clump like you
the fiery warmth that reeks out from miles of you
is burning through
whatever made you seem so very small
are you in real life but large in thought
come stand up tall

cannot wait until i get my hands on you
we can do the things we said we would
cannot wait until i see your smiling faces
and our love
will be misunderstood
