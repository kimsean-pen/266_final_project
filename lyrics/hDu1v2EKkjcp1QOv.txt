I could aim
But I could not fire
Got a bullet to spare to kill my desire
Who's calling the shots
One of us must make the peace
To have or to have not
The fire has got to cease
I'm loaded
Don't know where to point this thing
It's a sin
How we hit where it hurts
Who's calling the shots
One of us (one of us) must end this masquerade
To have or to have not
Let's heal the wounds that we've made
It's a war of the heart
(it's a war of the heart)
It's a war of the heart
Got a bullet to spare
Don't wanna send it your way
Who's calling the shots
One of us (one of us) must make the peace
To have or have not
The fire has got to cease
It's a war of the heart
(it's a war of the heart)
It's a war of the heart
I'm loaded
Don't know where to point this thing
(it's a sin) It's a sin
How we hit where it hurts
(how we hit where it hurts)
One of us (one of us)
Got to end this masquerade
Got to the heal the wounds that we've made
I've got a bullet to spare
Don't wanna send it your way
If you wanna end it
If you wanna end it just say
It's a war of the heart
(it's a war of the heart)
It's a war of the heart
(got to end this masquerade...)
I've got a bullet to spare
Don't wanna send it your way
If you wanna end it (it's a)
If you wanna end it (war of the)
Just say (heart...)
It's a war of the heart
It's a war of the heart
It's a war of the heart
