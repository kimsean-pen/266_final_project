(Condemned...) Condemned
Without given a chance to speak
Without acknowledgment they're made less than human

Condemned, condemned to anonymity
Trapped by, trapped by obscurity
Condemned, condemned to anonymity
Sentenced, sentenced to neglect

They will never share our blood
Yet is that reason to drain what's left of theirs
Abandoning compassion

Condemned, condemned to anonymity
Trapped by, trapped by obscurity
Condemned, condemned, condemned to anonymity
Sentenced, sentenced to neglect

Why do we uphold allegiance higher than maintaining life?
The ties of blood breaking a stronger bind

Condemned, condemned to anonymity
Trapped by, trapped by obscurity
Condemned, condemned, condemned to anonymity
Sentenced, sentenced to neglect
