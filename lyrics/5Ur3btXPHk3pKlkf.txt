Dark, you can't come soon enough for me
Saved, from one more day of misery
Everything I love, get back for me now
Everyone I love, I need you now

Don't forget a million miles for me
Safe and another day can pass by me
Everything I'd love, get back for me now
Everyone I'd love, I'd need you now

(So what?)
So I conned, I lied
I lied to me too
(So what?)
So I conned, I lied
I lied to me too
(So what?)

Hold out for the ones you know will love you
Hide out from the ones you know will love you
You, you too

Hide to the edge and back, be there
Slow to make my move, I'm almost there
Everything I say, I say to me first
Everything I do, I do to me first

(So what?)
So what, I lied
I lied to me too
(So what?)
So what, I lied?
I lied to me too

Hold out for the ones you know will love you
Hide out from the ones you know will love you
You, you too

Dark, you can't come soon enough for me
