Some girls fall in love and some love to lie
Some girls wanna act tuff and wanna make you cry

She's playing with your mind
She's playing with your mind
Boy you ain't gonna cry
She's playing with your mind

Some of them wanna talk and they'll tell you to hold on
Some girls'll eat you up on the telephone

She's playing with your mind
She's playing with your mind
Boy you ain't gonna cry
She's playing with your mind
They'll tell you to hold on
She's playing with your mind
