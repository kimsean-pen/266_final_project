Did I say something stupid?
There goes one more mistake.
Do I bore you with my problems?
Is that why you turned away?
Do you know how hard I've tryed to become what you want me to be?
Take me.
This is all that i've got.
This is all that I'm not.
All that I'll ever be.
I got flaws, I got faults
Keep searching for your perfect heart.
It doesn't matter who you are.
We all have our scars.
We all have our scars.
You say dont act like a child.
But what if it's a father I need?
It's not like you dont know what you got yourself into.
Don't tell me I'm the one that is naive.
Do you know how hard I've tryed to become what you want me to be?
Take me.
This is all that I've got
This is all that i'm not.
All that I'll ever be.
I got flaws, I got faults.
Keep searching for your perfect heart.
It doesn't matter who you are.
We all have our scars.
We all have our scars.
Come on just let it go.
These are things you can't control.
Your expactaitons, your expanations.
Tell me what you need.
You and your alternatives.
Don't send me to your therapist.
Deep down I know what you need.
And I know just what I wanna be.
ooh oh. ooh ooh ooh oh oh.
Take me
This is all that I've got.
This is all that I'm not.
All that I'll ever be.
I got flaws, I got faults.
Keep searching for your perfect heart.
It doesn't matter who you are.
