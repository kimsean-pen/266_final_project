Ohhh, yeah
Open up your heart, what do you feel
Open up your heart, what do you feel... is real

The big bang may be a million years away, no
But I can't think of a better time to say

World, hold on
Instead of messing with our future, open up inside
World, hold on
Wonder you will have to answer to the children of the sky

Ohhh, children of the sky...

Look inside, you'll find a deeper love
The kind that only comes from high above

If you ever meet your inner child, don't cry
Tell them everything is gonna be alright

World, hold on
Come one, everybody in the universe
World (come on), hold on
Wonder you will have to answer to the children of the sky

Children of the sky... alright
Love, don't take no for an answer, no no. alright!
Right here, spread love, everybody join together now
One race, one heart
Love and unity, everybody sing
yeahhhh.
World hold on

World, hold on
Come one, everybody in the universe
World (come on), hold on
Wonder you will have to answer to the children of the sky
World (come on), hold on
Come one, everybody in the universe
World (come on), hold on
Wonder you will have to answer to the children of the sky
