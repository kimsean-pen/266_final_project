Turn the light off
And file these thoughts away for a day
Turn the light off
He files his thoughts away for a day
Take our time off
Better to hear the way that you say
Take our time off
Better to hear the way that you say
She read his fortune
Two years and you're free upon completion
"I'll try my hardest
Just don't confuse me with my confessions"
The final season
He hoped for a crowd at his reception
He weighed his options
And left them behind for no good reason
I'm not changing these thoughts at all
The way that we answer the things that we're told
No i'm not changing these thoughts at all
The way that we answer the things that we're told
So turn the light off
I'll end with a perfect splash. Today
