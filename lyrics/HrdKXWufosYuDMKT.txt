Wake up
In the mood to set this place on fire
In the mood to set this place on...

Calling all my friends but they went to the praia
Oh wait, praia means beach, beach means praia
Alright

If you start feeling blue
Move your feet, feel the groove
If you start feeling blue
Move your feet, feel the groove

Shut your ears and listen, what's your rhythm?
What's your fever? Play, don't pause it, never stop
Shut your ears and listen, what's your rhythm?
What's your fever? Play, don't pause it, never stop

Shut your ears and listen, what's your rhythm?
What's your fever? Play, don't pause it, never stop
Shut your ears and listen, what's your rhythm?
What's your fever? Play, don't pause it, never stop

Take me to the stars...
